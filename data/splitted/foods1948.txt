review/summary: Got sick of them - FAST!
review/text: At first these were a nice departure from the usual Haribo bears, and the various flavors were interesting. However, the soft stickiness of the bears slowly started to work my nerves. They had this aftertaste that I can't explain that tasted chemical-like and unpleasant. I will never buy them again.

review/summary: ok... not the best
review/text: Some may call it an addiction, I like to call myself a gummy bear connoisseur. I had to buy these guys when I saw the claims that they are the best in the world. In my opinion, this is not the case. Yes, there are 12 flavors, and none are bad, though none are excellent either. Looking for soft, chewy gummies? I still put my faith in Black Forest.

review/summary: Not as good as Haribo and your tongue will turn blue
review/text: If you are a big fan of Haribo gummies, and have grown up eating that style of gummy, you will probably be disappointed with these.<br /><br />These are the large soft variety of gummy to you find in many store brands, as opposed to the small harder variety of the Haribo. You get roughly twice as many pounds for the price, which is a big plus. A big downside for adults is that the blue/purple colors turn your tongue blue, and it will stay that way until you brush your tongue clean with your toothbrush. The Haribo's don't have that side effect. As far as the fancy flavors go, that is just clever marketing as opposed to an actually benefit since none of the flavors taste as good as any of the basic Harbio flavors, in my opinion.

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: These are terrible. I normally buy and love the Black Forest gummies but thought I'd try these because of the variety of flavors. What a disappointment. There is little to no difference between the supposed "flavors". They don't taste juicy, like the Black forest. They taste sugary and acidic but not fruity. Worst of all, there is an underlying bitter, chemical taste to them that just completely ruins it. They do look pretty, but that's about the only thing they have going for them.

review/text: These gummies have rave reviews, so I decided to give them a try.  Looks like I'll be sticking with Haribo ones.  These gummies are indeed very soft, but for some reason, they just taste like soap.  They even smell a bit like soap.  I'm trying to see if there's ways to remove the smell--I'm going to try sticking them above a jar of rice to see if the smell can be absorbed, but it's really that bad.  The soapy smell/taste almost covers up any of the fruity flavors of the bears.

review/summary: Horrible chemical-tasting gummi bears
review/text: Based upon other reviews here, I gambled and bought these.  Yuk!!  These are the most awful-tasting gummies ever.  They have a strong chemical odor and taste.  Now I'm stuck with 10 pounds of them...  Total waste of money. I hate to just throw them away, but I'll never eat them.  The Haribo gummi bears are far, far superior to these.  Even the made-in-USA Haribo gummi bears that they sell here on Amazon in 5-lb bags.  (The Haribo gummi bears - "goldbaren" - made in Germany are even better than the USA-made ones, but they're considerably more expensive.  Haribo Germany also makes some fruit-juice goldbaren, called "Saftbaren" which are slightly softer and have exquisite real-fruit flavor.  I wish they sold those here on Amazon...)

review/summary: OMG!!!!! Best soft gummies ever!!!!
review/text: Ok, so I bought these on a whim, not wanting to pay nearly the same price for a 5lb bag of Haribo. Imagine my surprise when they turned out to be worth the switch. I've been a long-time Haribo fanatic. These gummies, however, while not as hard in texture as Haribo, more than make up for that in flavor.<br /><br />I normally space my gummy snacking, but could not keep my hands off these. My kids literally inhaled them by the handful. Even  my husband was hooked. After reading the label, I felt even better about eating them. They're made with mostly fruit and veggie additives. No HFCS!! Only caveat was the light yellow bears. They're banana flavored, but a little weird at first. The more you eat the more you taste the flavor.<br /><br />Overall, these gummies have made this Haribo eater a surefire convert. As a matter of fact, I'm on my way to buy more. A warning to the wise: One shipment will not last more than a couple days to one week max. Not saying there's not enough, but these are very addictive. Happy snacking!<br /><br />Addendum as of 9/5/09: The banana gummies are even better than before and even a little chewier. I also love the new packaging which actually lists the flavors. I've since tried to go back to Haribo and other brands, but to no avail. These gummies are still my fave! Cheers!

review/text: These truly are the absolute best gummi bears I have ever had!  The flavors are wonderfully intense.  They are not waxy or hard, just perfectly soft and chewy.  It turns out 10 pounds of gummi bears is even more than I thought it would be.  They will definitely last you a good long while!  Enough for a whole party of people.  Everyone was asking me, "aren't all gummi bears pretty much the same?" but once they started eating them, they couldn't stop either!

review/text: First of all, these Gummi's are delicious and fruity and are just the right amount of chewy. But I was most impressed by the fact that my Amazon delivery of them sat on my porch in 100 degree Memphis weather and they did not melt or get sticky! They were a bit squishy when I first opened them but after being inside the house about 30 minutes, they were perfect again! Sounds silly, I suppose, but it is good to know!

review/summary: OH MY GOSH, ARE THESE EVER GOOD!
review/text: I bought these after researching, as usual, best gummi bears.  Good call.  Problem is, I thought these would last 2 months or so being 10 lbs of gummi bears.  Wrong again.  My 21 year old son is devouring these. I was afraid they would make him sick or overly hyper, but they didn't. One bag was gone in 3 days! I couldn't believe it.  I had some, but he had the most. He loves fruity candy and said these are the best gummi bears he has ever had.  He is dying to open the 2nd package but knows if he does he will eat them too quickly and they will be gone so he is tormenting himself now.  I don't think he will last another day! Anyway, I think they are delicious.  I like the medium blue ones  (blue raspberry, I think) and the pink ones (grapefruit, I think).<br /><br />By the way, we did two taste tests with our 30 year old amazon parrot, laying out all the colors to see which he would pick.  Pink ones both times! Pepe' loves them too, and gets so excited when he sees the bag, but is only allowed one a day.<br /><br />  I hope my son opens the other bag soon so I can have some more! It's a great buy too.  Guess I better order some more!  P.S. ( Just now as I was finishing this I noticed my son  has already opened the 2nd package.  I knew he couldn't last!)

review/summary: Albanese Gummi Bears: Decent Candy, Not as good as most Haribo varieties but Less Expensive
review/text: I purchased these Albanese brand Gummi Bears based on reviews I saw on Amazon. People were saying that they are the best ever and better than Haribo. They were also cheaper than Haribo. So I decided to try them.<br /><br />They are softer than Haribo Gummi Bears. I think the Haribo gummy bears have a unique and very satisfying chew to them. Even softer Haribo candies such as the Peaches have a kind of thickness, a satisfying solidity to them. If you feel like me, you may not like the texture of the Albanese bears as much, as they are softer. On the other hand, I've heard some people say of the Haribo bears that they taste like plastic (due to the texture). These people may like the Albanese bears better. Biting through the Albanese brand bears, I guess the word I'd describe the texture might be "smooth" or "satiney"<br /><br />Since the Albanese brand bears mentioned several times that they had so many flavors, I was expecting unique and distinct flavors, in the way that Jelly Belly jelly beans are different and unique. These Albanese bears are not like that. While there are different flavors, it's not clear exactly what each flavor is supposed to be. The flavors seem to all kind of run together, even after you eat one color at a time.<br /><br />Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed, especially considering how so many reviews of this candy proclaimed it as being the "omg best ever" and "world's best" and "better than Haribo". While it is a good candy, these are gross overstatements and it makes me wonder how many of these glowing reviews are shill reviews placed by the manufacturer.<br /><br />TL;DR: Not as good as Haribo. Cheaper than Haribo. Better than generic store brand. Flavors not as distinct as expected based on advertising. Certainly not "best ever", despite the claims of some somewhat questionable reviews.

review/text: I bought these for my new wife as a gift.  We were both surprised.<br /><br />The 12 flavors are as clear and excellent as the colors, and like the famed jelly beans they DO taste like what they are claiming to!  Clean simple flavors strong enough to know what they mean to be but not so strong as to over-power your taste-buds.  I've sampled candy from the ultra-cheap to the pricey-gourmet, and these are definitely a superior product (without that Godiva-superior price).<br /><br />We've given samples to several people (so far) and they are all agreed: They're buying some, taking what's left in our hands, and they ALL call them the best gummi candy for taste they've ever had.<br /><br />Go ahead.  You will NOT be disappointed.

review/text: I initially tried the Albanese Gummi Worms... since I just LOVE Gummi Worms... they were pretty good... but I figured the Gummi Bears were a better value.<br /><br />OMG! These things are incredible! Usually with gummi's, unless it clearly says a flavor on the package, you get the standard "fruit punch" flavor. But with these gummi's... I can distinctly taste... peach, watermelon, blueberry, green apple, pineapple/pina colada, banana, cherry, strawberry, grape, orange, lemon and cherry!<br /><br />The ONLY thing that I don't like is the consistency is a little too soft for my tastes... but, I put them in the fridge to firm them up a bit and I'm all good!<br /><br />By far the best gummi's I've ever had... and I LOVE gummi's!

They are very tasty, and worth the purchase.<br /><br />Value-wise, this one is great!  This was a Pack of 2, which equals to 10 pounds of gummi bears (compared to the 5 pounds of Haribo gummi bears), so you get 5 more pounds for just a few dollars more!  I still intend to buy Haribo gummies, but these Albanese gummies will also be bought at the same time.<br /><br />Try these, you won't be sorry. :-)

review/summary: Larger, softer, more flavors, more flavor than any other brand, Black Forest is horrible compared to these.
review/text: I had never tried Gummie Bears before these...now they have replaced my sweet cravings and nothing else will do.  I ordered Black Forest to compare and they are dismal compared to these.  I will throw the rest of the Black Forest ones out now that my shipment of these have arrive...oh, and they will last a long time. They have lots of different flavors.  The only problem is they are tough to stop eating.  They also digest well.  When I ate the Black Forest my stomach rumbled.  These are by far the best. They are soft and flavorful and fun to eat because there are so many flavor choices.

review/summary: albanese 12 flavor assorted gummi bears
review/text: I have these on auto order we go thru them so much. My daughter and her husband came for the holidays and he doesn't really eat sweets but he really just about ate a whole bag himself!  I first ate Gummi bears way back in the 70's when the german club sold them when they got them from germany along with toblerone and these taste alot like them.  The german gummi bears taste a bit different than the american gummy bears.  I prefer these to gummy bears.  Yummmm

review/text: I am a gummy bear lover.  I have tried every gummy candy that has ever crossed my path.  These bears are THE BEST gummies I have ever tasted.  I also like Haribo bears, but these gummies are softer and more flavorful than Haribo bears.  The wide variety of specific flavors (grape, pineapple, pink grapefruit) is what makes these better than your average gummies, whose flavors are generally some ambiguous fruit flavor masked in different colors.<br />Do yourself a favor and try these bears - you won't regret it!

review/text: My boyfriend has always loved gummi candy so to go with a gift I wanted to buy him a brand he had never had before and to make sure it had flavors he probably had not tried. These were perfect. They remained soft and flavorful and putting them in a container allowedhim to eat them as he wanted. If anything he said I gave him too many because he could not stop eating them!<br /><br />Let's just say they did not last as long as I thought he would for 2 huge bags. A great product.

review/summary: yummy sticky softies
review/text: these gummy bears are quite tasty.  there are enough variety of flavors to keep your taste buds entertained and i can't say there are any flavors that i dislike, which is not something i can say for these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SATG8O">Albanese Assorted Tropical Bears, 5-Pound Bag</a>.  the white bears in the tropical assortment tasted like bananas while the white bears in this 12-flavor assortment tastes more like your normal white bears, so if the tropical whites are what's holding you back from trying this one out, do not fear.  there are some downsides to these bears though, for me anyway: they were too soft.  i like the consistency of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVOSE4">Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears, 5-Pound Bag</a> better.  they were also sticky, which makes for a sticky situation when you are munching on them at work or on the go.  but for how much you get for the price you pay, it's a yummy good deal.

review/summary: love 'em
review/text: My husbands grandmother loves gummys and I got her some wine gums last year for Christmas. She loved the flavor but they were tough for her to bite into. This year I decided to try the gummies we'd give her early and ordered these. These Albanese gummies have wonderful flavor and a nice soft texture, which is perfect for her. With 12 flavors it's harder to get tired of them then some other gummies. The banana and pineapple ones are very similar in color, and depending on lighting hard to tell apart.<br /><br />They arrived in 90+ degree heat but didn't melt into a pile of goo. Opened them up and noticed an odd smell, which was probably the package it came in reacting to the heat. I put the gummys in a new container and they smell fine now, and taste wonderful.<br /><br />Today I sent a small amount to work with my husband with his lunch and he shared them with his coworkers. They're so popular he texted me so I could email him the amazon link to share with his coworkers so they could order their own instead of eating all his.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with this product, and will definitely be buying them again.

review/text: These are the best gummy bears I have ever tasted. Hands down. There's so many flavors that it's hard to pick out a particular favorite. I offered some to my sibling and father and they too said they enjoyed them. So much so that between the 3 of us we had finished one 5 lb bag of them in a day while watching baseball.<br /><br />I don't know where these negative reviews are coming from where they say they're disgusting, the only thing I could think of is that they're competitors trying to distract potential customers from this company since most of them refer to a different company with a higher price for one pack instead of the deal you get with this company for two.<br /><br />I have already repurchased another 10 lbs of gummy bears and other candy, and will continue to do so.

review/text: These gummi bears are delicious and a great value! I was looking for fun foods to subscribe to on amazon and stumbled across these.<br /><br />I was concerned that the gummi bears would all taste the same because they were all lumped together in the same package, but they taste FANTASTIC! Each one has an individual flavor and is not too sugary sweet. The flavors taste like how they say they do on the bag. These really are the best gummi bears I've had and they are a better price than Haribo's. The fact that there are 12 flavors is an added bonus. My favorite is grapefruit!<br /><br />I might need to edit my shipments so these come to my house more often! I'm very happy I got these.

review/summary: These Are Great Gummy Bears!
review/text: So I bought these because of the rave reviews, because I have been eating gummy bears since I could chew as a child, and because there were grape bears and I have never tasted that flavor as well as a couple of others. So these bears were delivered when I was hospitalized (gallstone attack that led to a gallbladder removal surgery) and I really wanted to taste them since the hospital tends to give you soup with nothing in it when they think you cannot hold anything down. So my fiance decided to sneak some in to me and when I tasted them I thought I had died and gone to heaven. They were so soft and the flavors were amazing! I am very glad I bought these and now have signed up for the delivery. Although the grape flavor was my favorite so I may just have that flavor delivered. Definitely buy these. It brightened my day and will bring joy to yours!

review/text: I am not really much on reviewing candy but these are far by the best gummi bears I have ever eaten.  They are soft and not overly chewy to where you need to work like a cows mouth to chew them.  The flavors are all good and I read somewhere there was a banana flavored but I couldn't really tell there was one.  I don't usually eat candy until I have a stomach ache but that was my reward for eating so many.  Even with my stomach in pain I had to eat at least one more to be satisfied.  My kids don't really eat much candy but loved these and since they are easy to chew for them they like them even more.  If you love gummi bears this is probably your best option but when I bought mine I did not realize there were two bags so now I have quite a bit to go through.  Just keep in mind that they are easy to get carried away with when eating.

review/text: Do not order these. They can only be consumed in large quantities. You may develop carpal tunnel syndrome from the repetitive motion of bringing them to your mouth! ;}  Beware!<br /><br />Some people assert that gelatin is a good health supplement. I am trying to convince myself this is true to rationalize my chain-eating of these things. Also trying not to think about where they come from...<br /><br />As other people said, these are way better than those nasty little chew toy gummies that I used to think were kinda good a few at a time, every once in a while. Therein lies the problem. These ones have crazy different flavors to keep your mind entertained and soft chewiness that keeps your mouth occupied with disassembling them. Crazy!<br /><br />You are receiving ten frigging pounds of gummy trouble!!!! Bask in the sick guilty consumptive pleasure of it all!!!!

review/summary: Great soft bears!
review/text: If you like the soft type of gummy bears rather than the more chewy kind (like Haribo), you will love these.  They have a wide variety of flavors that really taste different, unlike some generic brand gummy bears that have different colors, but taste very similar.  These favorably compare to the old Amazin Fruit gummy bears that used to be popular.  If you are a single person, I would not get these for yourself, because you will get sick eating them (it is difficult to stop).  But if you have a family or a group of friends or coworkers to share these with, this is a great deal!<br /><br />These bears are delicious!

review/summary: Worked for my diet
review/text: I had recently started a diet and I decided to buy these gummy bears because I cannot have a salty meal without something sweet afterwards. I like the fact that these gummy bears are fat free and even though a serving of 12 has 29 grams of carbs, I could eat 2 or 3 and be satisfied because these bears are bigger than regular ones. All my friends who had them said they were a lot bigger than what they're used to. They're also very flavorful. There was one of the flavors I didn't like (one of the yellow ones, might have been banana) but the rest tasted great! The two bags lasted 4 months with multiple people eating from them every day. At the end of the semester I had to start giving them away because I still had half a bag and I couldn't eat them all. They worked for my diet (I lost a lot of weight even though I ate these gummies every day), so they were perfect for me!

review/summary: Yummy Gummies
review/text: There's a frozen yogurt shop near us that uses the smaller size of these (the cubs), and I fell in love with them. You get a much better variety of flavors. My favorite are the watermelon (the pale teal color). At the time I bought them, this was the best price per oz available, even directly from the manufacturer. At room temperature they have a good texture. You could say that they're the baby bear of gummies. Not too hard, not too soft, but just right. They do harden up somewhat when they're put on something cold, like ice cream or frozen yogurt, but it's not a bad thing. You're still not going to break your teeth on them. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a fun assortment of flavors. The only drawback I have found is that some of the colors are similar enough that they're hard to tell apart (mango and pineapple, and cherry and strawberry), but since all of the flavors are pretty good it isn't a problem for me. I think this is a superior product and I would definitely purchase them again.

review/text: I found these on Amazon after getting fed up with the high shipping costs charged by an on-line snack retailer.  These are half the cost and the shipping charges are reasonable (free with subscription).  They are a little soft for my husband's liking, but he takes out a baggie full and leaves the baggie open so they get a bit stale and then they are just right for him.  He loves the flavor variety.  So do the grandkids, and the soft texture doesn't bother them at all.  These are a hit with our family.

review/summary: Great gummies, but a little soft for me
review/text: What makes a great gummy bear is in the mouth of the beholder, of course. Some like the chewy Haribo type that give your jaws a workout, while others like the softer, mushier kind. This falls into the latter category.<br /><br />Out of the bag, they're extremely soft. If you want to keep them that way, put them immediately into an airtight container. But if you'd like them to harden up a little, leave them exposed to air.<br /><br />I do like the intensity of the flavors. They are:<br /><br />Ornery Orange (orange)<br />Poppin' Pineapple (light yellow)<br />Granny Smith Apple (green)<br />Rrripe Watermelon (light blue)<br />Lickin' Lemon (yellow)<br />Wild Cherry (red)<br />Mighty Mango (white)<br />Luscious Lime (light green)<br />Freshhh Strawberry (magenta)<br />Rockin' Raspberry (blue)<br />Groovy Grapefruit (pink)<br />Concord Grape (purple)<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind. While the product title says "fat free", this is NOT a diet food. Eating just 12 gummy bears (and who can eat just 12) take up 10% of your daily recommended carbohydrates. So if you're like me, and can easily go through 50 of them in one sitting, that's half of your daily intake, which you will need to burn off through running, biking, walking, swimming, and other physical activity, or it'll turn into fat in your system.

review/summary: Good Variety of Flavors, Good Quality
review/text: So I was really hungry for some gummi bears, and I had heard a bunch about the Albanese brand.  I've always been a fan of gummi's, usually going for the Trolli brand, so I figured I would give them a try.  Sadly, the free shipping and good pricing was only available on 2 5 lb bags, which is an absurd amount of gummi bears.  They arrived the next day (Thanks Amazon Prime 2-day shipping!).  The gummi bears are very good, a bit larger in size than the normal haribo ones, and I think they taste a good bit better.  I usually prefer sour candies, as the standard gummi's are lacking a bit in flavor, but these certainly fit the bill.  The item gets 4 stars instead of five because the gummi's really aren't that amazing, they are simply very good.

review/text: Ok I recieved the gummies and it wasn't melted or sticking to each other. Taste good the flavors was there more on certin colors then others. Wasn't the best gummmies I've tasted becuse I had ones that had jucie flavors coming out one kind before. But this could come secound to those.

review/summary: Fantastic deal, great flavors, Made in USA
review/text: I initially bought a 5 lb sack of Haribo Gummi Bears. They were decently run of the mill, a little chewy, and missing fruit juice and made in Turkey. I thought I would give these a go. Great choice. These gummi bears are made in USA, have a huge variety of flavors, and great texture at 75% of the price per lb. Sadly the one con on both is neither contained real juice

review/text: It was my first time purchasing these gummi bears, and wow, they are as good as I was led to believe! Great flavors! Watermelon, mango, apple and cherry are my favorites, but you can't go wrong with any of the TWELVE flavors. Such a big burst of flavor and they're softer than most other gummi bears. Will definitely order again.

review/text: These are by far the best gummy bears that I have ever had.  I can't even eat other gummies, because they don't compare to these.  I was a little skeptical when I first ordered based on the other reviews, but I was completely wrong.  They are delicious and unlike any gummy bear out there.  I took them to work to share with my co-workers and they are addicted to them also.  They have purchased them and have shared with others.

review/text: This was my first purchase of the Albanese assorted gummi bears. I'm always wary aboout purchasing food items online since I like to see what I'm buying. I worried that the gummi's might be too firm since I like softer gummi bears. But I was not disappointed! These were the perfect texture and the different flavors are delicious. I've never written an online review before but these gummi's deserve it. If you're hesitating because you're not sure if the gummi's are really all of that, trust me-they are!

review/text: I like Gummi bears.  That is a little of an understatement, since obviously anyone buying 5+ lbs of candy probably has "a problem."<br />I purchased these off-brand candies due to the number of positive ratings from other reviewers on Amazon.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.  These are soft and a little larger than the well-known competitor's candies. I like both, but I do enjoy the additional flavors from Albanese.<br /><br />It is a few months since my first purchase and I needed something to get free shipping with a book order - more Gummies to the rescue!

review/summary: Smells great; smooth
review/text: Bought this to try and it did not disappoint. Always loved the whole bean roasted scent, but once grinded the flavor usually is gone (or simply dominated by internal coffee scent). The French Vanilla scent is very strong in this ground coffee, and the scent is followed-through to the coffee.<br /><br />I read from some Internet reviewers that they think it's better than grinding whole beans.  I personally don't disagree. One night we invited some friends and I decided to conduct a survey. I had Peet's whole bean French Dark Roast available to do taste test.  All liked this hand-roasted French Vanilla. But once they tasted Peet's after, they all preferred Peet's. Not sure it's a fair test since this is medium roast but I personally like this for the flavor.

review/summary: One great tasting gum that's sure to do the trick !!!
review/text: Dentyne Ice Peppermint chewing gum has saved the day for me many, many times. I always keep a pack in the glove compartment of my car. I also carry the gum in my pocket so I can pop a piece in my mouth to freshen my breath just before social occasions--and even just before a dental visit!<br /><br />The gum is sweetened with sorbitol and aspartame instead of sugar; the absence of sugar is better for your teeth. The sorbitol and aspartame substitutes for sugar may make this a good chewing gum for diabetics; but please double check that with your doctor if you have any concerns about that. A piece of gum has a "whopping" five calories so it won't interfere with any diet; and it has no sodium. It is very low in carbohydrates. It even comes with a freshness expiration date stamped onto the reverse of the package! Great! It does contain phenylalanine; if that is a concern for you then I would not recommend this product. It does not appear to be kosher, either, just in case that is important to you.<br /><br />In addition, the 12 piece of gum pack is very slender; and this makes it very easy to carry it with you in a pocket or a ladies pocketbook.<br /><br />Overall, I can't tell you how many times this gum has served as a really great breath freshener--I can't count that high! It also makes for a tasty, pleasant chewing gum. Thank you, Dentyne, for making this wonderful chewing gum! I am one loyal customer!  SMILES<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: Maybe I'm spoiled by all the great split-pea soups I've had over the years, but really ... it should be hard to mess up split pea soup.  The taste of this Progresso is OK, but the main ingredient is whole in-the-skin green peas in a very thin soup.  The whole peas are undercooked somewhat so are a bit hard and chewy and they all float on top of the soup.  I know ... peas are peas are peas, but this is just weird visually and in texture when eating the soup.  I expect a split pea soup to be made with split peas and to be fairly thick as far as soup goes.  Oh, and there's over 1500 mg of sodium in one can, 690 per one cup serving.

review/text: This is easy to use and that is the most wonderful thing about this product.  My older dog would never let me brush her teeth without biting me, so I was always looking for alternatives. I like the fact that you just put some in the drinking water. It took about four days for me to really notice a difference. But now when I get me afternoon "face washes", I don't have to turn my head. I can actually enjoy my welcome home committee! I don't know if there is anything that can completely remove my old dogs foul smelling breath, but this comes close. Thank you!

review/summary: Horrible!
review/text: We got this because my dog had horrible breath! Well we gave him some last night and this morning he had 4 sezuires! I would never recommend this to anyone. We took him to a vet and it cost us over 300. Never again! Please, for the safety of your animals, do not buy this product.

review/summary: Dental Fresh Review
review/text: I tried the Dental Fresh product as instructed and both my dog and cat had episodes of vomiting. My dog literally refused to drink her water afterwards. I have a well and neither of my pets are used to exposure to chlorine, which the product contains. Apparently, they don't tolerate this chemical any better than I do. I passed it on to my neice who had recommended it. Thanks, but no thanks.
