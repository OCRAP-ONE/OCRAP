review/summary: Flavorless
review/text: Tried Paul Prudhome's Salt Free Magic Seasoning and it's a complete dud. Adds nothing remotely salt like to the flavor. Hard even to detect the chile pepper that is supposed to flavor it. It is as if it had been on the shelf for 10 years and the spices lost their zip, but the expiration date shows 2014 so it's fresh.<br />Mrs. Dash is by no means great but it is far, far superior<br />Do not waste your money.

review/summary: Tim Tam dark chocolate cookies
review/text: Tim Tams are an icon in Australia.  Great cookies (they call them biscuits) now available in the US.  Do the "Tim Tam Slam" by biting off a tiny bite on each  end, dipping one end in coffee and sucking like a straw.  The coffee is absorbed by the cookie and the taste is wonderful!

review/summary: So yummy! Won't be disappointed! :)
review/text: I haven't been to australia, but I have heard of this from a youtuber "itsjudytime" and she reviewed these which got me to want to try these out because she made them look that good! Luckily i read a comment that they are sold at "cost plus world market"! I remember passing by one but never really had the curiousity to go check it out until now. Found one near by, and tada...there they were! Wasn't called Tim tams but arnott's was the one i found and to my surprise...3/4 of the boxes were gone, only 3 left so that tells me..it must be delicious! They were about $3.99 at the store and lucky I found them there or else pay for big fee of shipping (but then again, i suppose these would be worth the price for how deelish they are!) so check em out at your nearest world market! I made some hot chocolate and shabam....i was in heaven. I could only eat two in one sitting but if i could..i'd eat the whole thing :) I'll forsure am going to buy some more!

review/summary: Tim Tams rock my face off
review/text: Tim Tams are the most amazing cookie ever created. Just bite off both ends and suck a hot drink through it (like coffee or my favorite, hot chocolate). You gotta wait until it's about to fall into the drink due to over-saturation and then SLAM IT! (That means put it in your mouth and eat it.)

review/summary: The Third Bite
review/text: These cookies will surprise you, but only if you take at least 3 bites.  I shared my box with friends and family, yet each of us noticed a pattern.<br /><br />Bite 1 will remind you vaguely of other US cookies-candies yet you cant place the taste.  Bite 2 you'll say, "This is pretty good but not worth importing it from Australia.". By bite 3, you'll be searching for more.  Each of my friends who tried one vowed on their 3rd bite to buy them online or when the holiday season finally brings some to Target.  My coworker tried a Tim Tam slam (bite the ends then suck milk through like a straw before eating it).  She went from not impressed in bite 1 to asking me to help her order enough some from Australia.<br /><br />This isn't a soft or gourmet cookie.  Its similar to the simple joys of an oreo but far more addictive when you reach bite 3.  The closest comparison i can give is BERGER COOKIES from Baltimore which are simple but beyond addictive.

review/text: My vet of over 30 years has a mom that still works in the hospital. I adore the woman and one day she shared one of these cookies. She told me another patient's "person" brings them to her from Australia. I knew I could find and probably at a nearby deli that I use often. It has a great international selection. Since they never bothered to return a call or answer my email, I went to my old friend Amazon. Sure enough, there they were!  I bought my friend some more and also some for my Mother ( actually mother-in-law) who loves sweets. They are delicious. Worth every penny.

review/text: Love these and am glad to be able to get them here.  If you're looking for a rich chocolate cookie, Tim Tams are it.  Not sure which American cookie to compare them to, probably a chocolate covered Oreo, but with a chocolate middle.  Lots of chocolate here.  That's actually a downside for me.  Too much chocolate.  A little goes a long way with me, so these are amazing in moderation and with a big glass of milk.

review/summary: These kick Oreos in the Behind
review/text: I'm not sure what "Hipcat 21" is referring to, but the Tim Tams I just ate from Australia would be pretty darn hard to suck milk through. They are a layered wafer cookie, and you'd have to have the suction of a Hoover vacuum to pull milk through those babies. But, they are amazing little pieces of heaven, even if completely worthless as a straw. They are crispy, and chocolaty, and so darned good that I would gladly give up my Double Stuff Oreos if these were widely sold in the US. Those lucky Australians!!

My boss at work get's the Pepperidge Farm versions in Canada and they are tasty, but don't compare to the variety and subtle creamy finish of the Aussie bars.

review/summary: One of the Best Cookies I've Ever Tasted
review/text: Don't be fooled. It is a biscuit...but it tastes more like a chocolate bar, and has calories to match. Yet this is probably Australia's best treat. It is very good. I was surprised. It's fun to eat and it tastes very good. The level of sweetness is just right. While I describe Tim Tam as a dense malt chocolate biscuit, with a dense chocolaty creme atop, covered in milk chocolate, I must say that it's much more than that (as far as sweets are concerned). Try it out. I'm assured that you won't be disappointed. It's also fun to bit off two end and suck in milk to make it mushy. This is definitely a classic, up there with the Oreo, or higher.

They are quite high in both calories and fat, but with something this scrumptious that's to be expected.  Just don't eat too many at one time. These are supposed to be a limited time candy, but I hope Mars reconsiders and adds them as a regular candy.

I have never had a mouth full of toilet cleaner, but this is what I would imagine it tasting like.  Very strong chemical taste with a very gelatinous plastic-like texture, highlighted in a dull orange-brown.  I looked at the ingredients and the main ingredient is High Fructose Corn Syrup, a healthy dose of cornstarch, and some oleoresin paprika mixed in.  I found the taste to be so horrible, I threw the rest of the container away.  Yuck!

review/summary: NOT the Sweet 'n Sour sauce they advertise...
review/text: The Sweet n Sour sauce pictured is bright red and VERY similar in looks to the Sweet n Sour sauce you get from Chinese food restaurants.  I ordered a case of this stuff for $ 19 and was very disappointed in it.  The sauce I received is a brownish color with bits of red and green pepper in it.  It's not very sweet like you would expect (and hope) it to be.  The label on the sauce I rec'd was totally different also.  The one online is the 'New and Improved' label and the one I rec'd was not.<br /><br />My opinion is that if you're looking for the traditional restaurant style sweet n sour sauce then this is definitely not it.  Now I have to figure out what to do with an entire case of this cruddy stuff.  It would be one thing if the sauce was just different but I actually don't like the flavor at all.  Oh well, I'll just keep looking.  :)

review/summary: Pistachios, what was god thinking?
review/text: When Jesus saved all of the holy mesiah from drowning by making Noah build a giant boat, he must have messed up and let pistachios on the boat.  Who creates such a pecular object?  The ackward shell on the outside hiding the hidious greenish brown nut on the inside.  This is the nerd of the nut family people.  Then some of them the shell doesnt have that little helper crack to make it easy to peel.  Then you have to bite it or something and get shells in your mouth.  Its horriable that a nut could be deemed livable, we should all band together and rid the world of pistachios.  Maybe if they called it something cooler i would have different views on it.  How about calling it "The Evil Nut From Hell That's Color Is Best Described As Breen, A Mix Of Brown And Green", then i would have no problem with it.  If we all band together this fantasy could become a reality.  maybe well call it tenfhtcibdabamobag for short.<br /><br />Actually now that i think of it, I love pistachios and the name.  Disregard everything I had just stated and go eat some NOW.

It gives them that extra kick without adding garlic. I highly recommend these 7 ounce pouches of black peppercorns. They are just perfect and grinds very well in my peppermill. And yes I will definitely purchase these again in the future.

review/summary: all purpose pepper
review/text: We go through peppercorns.  Besides going in the grinder we morter and pestal for rubs on steaks and sauces.  We have tried the fancy Penzy peppercorns but for our taste we really can't tell much difference.  We like that these are in small bags and so can be kept fresh longer which I find does more for the taste than rarity.  You can't beat the price!

review/summary: It's a lot of pepper...
review/text: It's basic black pepper. However, for the price and the amount, it is one heck of a deal. For a couple who uses a moderate amount of black pepper, this should last us well into the second Obama administration and probably well into Hillary's first term as President, so that's a lot of pepper.

review/summary: One of the best items in the Hormel Compleats line.
review/text: I've been working through all of the Hormel Compleats with beef of one kind or another. I work at home and really am not interested in any extensive culinary efforts for lunch. In any event, I really am not much of a gourmet either. I appreciate excellent cuisine, but for lunch I just want something tasty to eat and simple to prepare.<br /><br /> Preparation could not be easier. Punch a couple of small holes in the cover of the container, pop it in the microwave for 90 seconds and let it stand for a minute. The worst part is opening the container. There's a plastic-like sheet acting as the cover. It is miserable to pull back. The adhesive is super-strong. The container is still hot and there is the potential that giving it a hard pull will result in contents shooting everywhere. I've taken to carving off the covers with a knife.<br /><br /> As for the meal itself, this one is yummy. There's a relatively thick slice of tender beef, carrots, potatoes and, I think, some onion. All of this is floating in a veritable ocean of brown gravy. Well, maybe not an ocean, but there's a lot of it. This entr&eacute;e would pass muster at the local diner.<br /><br /> Great for a quick, light, tasty lunch.<br /><br />Jerry

review/text: I don't understand the positive reviews of this particular dinner.  It used to be my favorite, lean roast beef, creamy potatoes and good gravy.  But it's not what it used to be--the meat is still ok, but the potatoes are now a  solid pasty blob.  You have to break them down with a fork, and there's not enough gravy to do it.  In my opinion these are now inedible.  Try the chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy instead--the potatoes aren't as awful and there's plenty of gravy.

review/summary: Not the same recipe as the five star reviews
review/text: I'm pretty sure that this meal has changed drastically since the glowing five star reviews for this have been made. For one, there are no carrots or onions or anything like that which are mentioned in one review. This is simply only roast beef, mashed potatoes, and gravy. That's it. Second, it's not very impressive.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch but TWO of these meals in a row had extremely lumpy mashed potatoes. After heating (and adding extra time in hopes that would help), the mashed potatoes were in a solid block under the meat. I had to smash and stir it for about three minutes before it resembled actual mashed potatoes but they were far from creamy. The lumps left behind were small and numerous and extremely unappetizing to eat (in fact, even though today I ended up skipping breakfast and am starving, I really can't bring myself to eat them).<br /><br />The meat though is surprisingly good. I'm usually not a big fan of many of the red meat in the Hormel line but I really enjoyed this one. But then, it was the best thing about the meal so maybe it's raised up in comparison.<br /><br />The gravy is not even half as salty as the red meat gravy meals tend to be which is an extremely good thing.<br /><br />Honestly, the best thing about these Hormel meals is that they fill you up for a very low price, can be stored anywhere, and really can't be easier to prepare. I ate the meat and about 1/4 of the mashed potatoes in this meal and even with my skipping breakfast, I feel completely satisfied. If these were lower in calories and sodium, I would honestly say these would always be our go-to when needing to grab a meal in ten minutes between meetings.

review/summary: Where Is The Roast Beef?
review/text: Honestly when it does come down to Hormel, they've made some great foods like Chili & tamales. But sometimes when it has cmae down to some of their prepared foods, they just could've brought out more. The Hormel Compleats Roast Beef & Mashed Poptatoes is very easy to prep up in the microwave, without the aid of a freezer of refrigeration after purchase. Yet, there honestly wasn't enough roast beef in the easy to make meal. I was honestly a bit dissapointed. Not only that, I felt that it could've honestly tasted much, much better than what I got when I first tasted it. I hope Hormel does make better tasting versions of their compleats soon. It isn't bad for anyone who is on a budget or for anyone that is looking for a quick meal made ready whenever you're hungry, but more taste should've been added to it.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Taste: C+<br /><br />Overall: C+

review/summary: Salty and offputting aftertaste to the gravy
review/text: The box art always makes packaged food look so delicious, but this is basically a thin slice of processed beef on top of a bed of mashed potatoes. The potatoes are very dense and not at all fluffy like the photo, but did have a substantial and hearty texture to it. It was sort of a solid block of potatoes at the bottom of the bowl and I had to break it apart with the fork. I've uploaded a photo to show you what the actual product looks out.<br /><br />Preparation is easy. Just poke some holes in the top and put it in the microwave for 1-1.5 mins. The texture of the beef and potato is about what I'd expect from processed food, but the gravy was very off-putting and didn't taste right. My dish was well before the expiration date of 12/06/12, but had a funny and unpleasant sour aftertaste to it. Sodium content is moderate at 830 mg (35% daily value) and tastes overly salty.<br /><br />I will not be buying this particular variety again. It just doesn't taste good.

review/summary: over priced, small, dubious quality
review/text: As a background, i have been preparing escargot for years at home and decided to upgrade my aging collection of olde Pyrex and metal escargot plates and to have matching dishes to serve 6 friends or family.<br /><br />I just received my escargot plates-had hoped that the ceramic would be superior in heat retention.<br />My disappointment comes from the quality.  The plates themselves appear to be a heavy stoneware-like material.  They are not. Worse still when i called the vendor i was told that each plate was very heavy and that was the reason for the high shipping cost.  A lot of nonsense and hooey.<br /><br />The glazing was incomplete on the bottoms of three out of 6, and on one of the handles.  This may result in moisture penetrating the ceramic.  It certainly will make clean up tougher.  The depressions are small at best to hold small snails and ample butter, and downright tight for the extra large snails. There is no lip on the edge which will allow for extra butter.  Worst is that these are 4.5" in diameter-downright small.  Very disappointing and i would not recommend these.<br /><br />They are, however, minimally functional and appear that they would retain heat similarly but not better than glass or ceramic plates without the bowl.<br /><br />Also the picture seems to show a two tone dish, brown top with a more rustic grey brown lower section, like real stoneware,  as well as a taper-mine are not like this, they are evenly brown and not tapered.<br /><br />Not happy as there as larger plain ceramic dishes available for half the price.  I thought these were a superior product.  I would not recommend these for the above reasons.  Shipping prices posted are ridiculous.  Actually, not ridiculous, they are outrageous, as all six, in thier cehap cardboard box (which holds six-likely originally sold as sets) weighed about 1.5 lbs total. The shipping prices quoted via the Amazon portal are absurd.  These bowls are made in Taiwan, which only bearing is that the cost versus quality is apparent.  WHiel the description i accessed indicates these are made in France , they are not.<br /><br />IMHO a waste of money, unless you like the color and compactness. When i complained to the vendor i was dismayed at the customer service, including a claim for re-stocking fees for defective items shipped, something i have never encountered. More dismaying still, is that these items in the vendors catalog, included in my shipment , sell for almost a dollar less than listed here.  So not only does the seller charge high shipping, a handling charge, but also more than its own catalog price.  I think this is a vendor to be avoided from my experience.

review/text: While I've enjoyed fruit and black cherries all of my life and eat them while in season, I noticed after eating a reasonable amount on two separate occassions how good I felt, no joint pain, but then after a day or two the joint pain came back. I couldn't find cherries again at the supermarket, so I tried Black Cherry Juice, Organic Knudsen's, in place of the fruit.  Within a day I started feeling great again, so I drank a small amount each day during the day (a bottle lasted a week) and continued to feel fantastic.  When I went back to the store to buy more, they were completely out - and all the other juices in the same brand were fully stocked - so apparently I wasn't the only one who believed in this cherry juice!  I've tried tart cherry as well, but it doesn't seem to offer the same relief.  I will now stay as stocked as possible on this Juice!

In this day and age when "Natural" fruit drinks have Apple juice or Grape Juice as their first ingredient, it is refreshing to come across something that is EXACTLY what the label states -- 100% Black Cherry Juice.<br /><br />It IS sweet enough right from the bottle, but if I need more sweetness I can always add a little undiluted frozen apple cider, or honey, or raw sugar.<br /><br />I drink it straight, add lemon juice if I so desire, or add it to my iced tea.

review/summary: Greatest remedy for my gout!
review/text: This cherry juice has helped me time and time again fend off my gout attacks.  Every time i start to feel an attack coming, i drink 8 ounces of cherry juice from a 32 oz bottle, until it's gone, so for 4 days and my gout goes the other way, by day 5, it's gone... although, just to be sure i usually get a 2nd bottle of this stuff at my local vons/safeway and drink it for the next 4 days just to be sure.  If you have GOUT, TRY THIS.  I have never had to go on medication for my gout and this works great for me.  Hope that helps!

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: This is very tasty and has a moderate black cherry flavor with some tartness.  I understand others' comments regarding this having a slightly prune juice quality.  Kind of tastes like 70% cherry juice mixed with 30% light prune juice.  I attribute this to the pasteurization process plus it's not filtered unlike a lot of prepared juices.  Still, I like it.

review/summary: in testing how well this works for arthritis....
review/text: As someone that's been dealing with arthritis since childhood, if simply drinking cherry juice is reported to help I would happy to test that theory.<br /><br />Background: at age 37 I had several joints replaced in my hand with recommendations to do both hip and knees as well but I simply can't go through that again. I'm always seeking natural and holistic remedies to help with the pain and stiffness and cherry juice came up in my research as something to try. This little bottle of juice had a really big challenge here though and I went into testing it knowing that my situation may be a bit beyond the normal aches and pains people usually take this for.<br /><br />Results: After using drinking 1-2 six ounce glasses each day for 6 weeks I did not notice a significant reduction in pain or stiffness. If the star rating were for this aspect I would award 2.5-3 stars.<br /><br />The Knudsen company does not make any health claims regarding this product so as far as a beverage I would give it 4 stars. I agree with the reviews that state this does have a somewhat prune-like flavor to it. One person stated it tastes like 70% cherry and 30% prune and I would agree with that statement.<br /><br />Conclusion: I was pleased to see this juice had helped so many reviewers with their arthritis and gout; as a juice product only I think the cherry flavor is good but may not be for everyone because of the strong note of prune flavor.

review/summary: Purest liquid smoke on the market!
review/text: I LOVE liquid smoke, so do most people after they've had my steak, chops or chicken; I've helped initiate more than a few fans. Last year my local store stopped carrying Wright's, but brought in 3 new brands to replace it. All three brands had soy in them and other various ingredients. Having only used Wright's in the past I was shocked to learn that not all liquid smokes are created equal. Wright's liquid smoke is allergen-free, which in my family is hugely important. I was delighted to find Wright's on Amazon, now I order by the case, save money and get the purest product on the market.

review/summary: PUPPIES LOVE THEM AND THEY'RE GOOD FOR THEM TOO
review/text: I breed Dobermans and Mini Schnauzers and have used these biscuits for the puppies chewing needs when they're cutting their baby teeth since my first litters were born. It's a positive chewing item for them and nutritious as well. When my puppies go to their new lives with their new families I always include a dozen or so of these biscuits along with other things to make their transition as easy as possible. I like the fact that these puppy biscuits have no dyes or other flavors added and recommend that the new owners avoid the other flavored biscuits(even prior to the peanutbutter scare a year ago!). I personally don't like the idea of dyes in food and treats because some of then can bring about allergic reactions and judging from the reaction of all the dogs and puppies- these taste so great they don't need the other flavors to enjoy their nutritious treats!

After moving out of the area, I couldn't find it. Went to Whole Foods in DC and there it was again for about 2 years. They decided not to carry it anymore. Well, I was miffed for a while. Then it came to me, "You shop at Amazon, why not try there?" Guess what, I bought a case and will be ordering a case again, and again, and again. Found some other gluten and wheat free products I use daily. Amazon, you're my place to shop for my gluten and wheat free products.<br />Thanks, Julia-

review/summary: Great for pancakes, muffins, and bread...
review/text: I use this mix to make pancakes often; it works wonderfully for that! I also made some really good pumpkin-pomegranate muffins with this baking mix, and those turned out so excellent that no one ever guessed they were gluten-free. This mix works well for plain bread, too. I have also used this flour to bread fish and to make the crispy topping for cherry crisp/cobbler. When it comes to making cookies and cake, though, you may want to use almond flour, coconut flour, or a white rice baking mix, because the brown rice baking mix has a distinct whole-grain taste to it. As long as you're baking something for which you want that whole-grain taste, this mix will work well for you! I suggest storing it in the refrigerator or freezer to extend the shelf life. I store a box at a time in the fridge, and the rest in the freezer, and it has stayed fresh for a long while that way.

review/summary: Shortcut to great Mexican recipes at home
review/text: Ro-Tel has a variety of diced tomatoes flavored for every taste.  For fresh, home style salsa, you can't beat their Lime and Cilantro version.  For tacos, use the Medium Hot version.  But the hands down, all around best is their Hot Diced Tomatoes with Habanero.<br /><br />If you love hot Mexican cooking like I do, you'll think you died and went to Heaven with this!  It is definitely NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!  Habanero is the hottest of all the peppers you can eat.  It is off the Scovill Scale of hotness like Einstein is off the IQ scale.  But, at the same time, it is versatile and its uses are only limited by your imagination.  Need to tone it down, add some sour cream or Philly cream cheese, or drain off the water in the can and mix into your recipe that way.  Mix it into chili and simmer it down with lots of water for superb flavor and eye-watering heat.  For parties, stir into a pot of nacho cheese for a zip that everybody will remember.<br /><br />Can you tell I love this stuff? But don't take my word for it, try it yourself -- you'll love it!

If you like spicy food the hot version is just right for you. Now, everyone I talk to doesn't seem to grasp how versatile Rotel is and thinks it's just for mixing with Velveeta and making queso dip with. How very wrong they are! (although that is a great use of it as well) Here's some of the things we regularly do with Rotel:<br /><br />~Add to a grilled chicken/turkey/chicken/etc and cheese quesadilla<br />~Add to spaghetti sauce<br />~Add a can to taco meat as the liquid portion when you add the seasoning<br />~Use to make salsa<br />~I use a can (along with broth) as part of the soup base when I make spicy chicken noodle soup<br />~Use to make spicy tomato baked mac and cheese (or simply add some to a box of Kraft, it's delicious)<br /><br />Really anything you'd normally enjoy tomatoes with Rotel works great for and adds a spicy kick.

Since I live now in the US and there is no really good falafel where I live, the best tasting falafel is made from Telma falafel mix. It's delicious and comes out a little crunchy. I am Vegan and falafel is a favorite meal of mine so I make it often. I have tried all the brands out there and Telma is the only one that is worth buying. It comes close to the best falafel I ever ate in Netanya.

review/summary: Weak and flavorless
review/text: This sampler offers 2 of each:<br /><br />Captivating Earl Grey Darjeeling<br />Extraordinary English Breakfast<br />Night Blooming Jasmine Green<br />Exotic Tropical Mango<br />Chocolate Mint Decadence<br />Soothing Chamomile<br />Strawberry Seduction<br />Traditional Japanese Genmaicha<br /><br />I was so excited when I found this sampler - and the flavors sounded so yummy! Luxe is a Seattle company, another reason why I wanted to like this. Unfortunately, each kind is way too weak and flavorless. Do they use old, or poor quality tea? Was my box expired? It could be, but regardless, there is too little tea per bag. And even using 2 t-bags per cup, the flavor was still 'blah'. (I've also tried their supposed higher quality triangle bags, but the taste is the same.) To be fair, I didn't bother trying Chamomile and Earl Grey, so who knows, those could be good. The only one with a strong/good flavor and aroma is the Strawberry Seduction, but I wouldn't know how it compares with other brands as I don't care for strawberry tea.

review/summary: Not Impressed with the Strength of Flavor
review/text: I love hot teas, and I thought I would like this sampler. While the flavors taste good, I have found none of them is sufficiently strong after brewing.  The flavors and weak and mellow even with proper brewing.  I do like the idea of the flavors and the silk bags, but will continue to drink other hot teas.

review/summary: Great taste and quality
review/text: Luxe's commitment to quality is outstanding!  The silken teabags contain very high quality teas and the bags themselves are very elegant!  There are no staples in the teabags which not only looks great but it makes the bags microwaveable, too!<br /><br />Once you develop a preference of your favorite tea, I recommend buying a 50pc masterpack of the 5 gram triangle silken bags (also no staples).  the tea used in these are even higher quality.

review/summary: The best of the best! A+++++
review/text: Wellness Core grain free is the absolute best wet food you can feed your dog. To my knowledge, it has the highest amount of protein of all canned dog food. My dogs love it, and I mean they go crazy for it and devour their dinner whenever I mix this stuff with their dry food. This product is also suitable for dogs of all life stages, including puppies, which is not the case with most canned dog food. It is expensive but worth the money. Wellness is a fantastic brand, free of by-products, bad preservatives and animal digest, which anyone in their right mind would not want to feed their dogs. A+++++
