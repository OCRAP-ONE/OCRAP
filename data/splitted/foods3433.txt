review/summary: Delicious, Affordable Coffee
review/text: I've always been an avid coffee addict and in an attempt to save on extra spending, I got in the habit of brewing my own coffee everyday. Usually I just bought whatever was on sale (including the large, 20+ oz jugs), but never online. When I saw the Amazon Subscribe & Save option, I thought it could be a great way to keep my coffee cheap and always stocked.... And I was right! I think Folgers 100% Colombian is already a great product, and the amazon.com shipment was simple, fast, and at a great price. I go through the 27.8oz jug in a few weeks, so for me there's no issue with freshness. Each jug is sealed so that when you do need it, you're opening it fresh anytime.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to keep subscribing (and saving!) to this product with amazon.com - an all-around great buy!

review/summary: Great Coffee, Great Price, Great Service
review/text: I had made my regular trip to the local grocery store, loaded up my cart, stood in a long line while reading tabloid covers, checked out, and made it home only to realize that I had forgotten to pick up coffee.  I had a couple days left, but running out of coffee at my house is an apocalyptic proposal.  Our mornings would come to a screeching halt and the standard pre-work funk would become a downright foul mood.<br /><br />Rather than brave the grocery store again, I decided to try Amazon's subscribe and save program.  This review is as much about the service as it is about the coffee itself.<br /><br />If you haven't tried Folger's Colombian, its a good coffee.  Nice flavor, relatively dark brew, no bitterness.  It is already ground, no hassle drip coffee.<br /><br />The subscribe and save sent three large containers. The price, if divided between the containers, is approximately the same as at the grocery store.  The containers have an air-tight seal under the lid, so the coffee will stay fresh until I need to open the next one.  We use about one container per month and the subscribe and save offers an delivery option for once every 3 months. Amazon's shipping was very quick (and I selected the free shipping option).  I ordered on Thursday, the expected delivery date was the following Wednesday, but I got my coffee on Monday afternoon.<br /><br />So all is well in the house: I happily avoided a trip to grocery store, and everyone has their morning coffee.  If you have a couple days worth of coffee left and don't want to drive to the store, try ordering it here.  I was very pleased with the experience.

review/summary: Somewhat bland and weak, not one of my favorite blends
review/text: I recently tried Folgers Colombian Ground Coffee because it was on sale at my local grocery store. I found this coffee to taste very average and not quite up to my standards. If you like bland coffee without much flavor then you may like this blend. However I like a bolder blend and this coffee was a little disappointing to me personally. It doesn't taste bad or anything it just doesn't have enough flavor to suit my taste. On the bright side this coffee costs about 1/3 less than my normal Starbucks brand coffee.

review/summary: My favorite Sunflower Oil on Amazon
review/text: This oil is the best, I am a cooking aficionado and after trying dozens of oils this is my favorite all-around for cooking. I use Lodge Logic cast iron to cook and have had the best results using this. The quality is superb. The oil is light and healthy. It's great for anything from salad dressings to saut&eacute;ing. If you want a raw sunflower oil this is not it, this seems to be slightly processed to refine and deodorize so I suspect the raw sunflower would have additional nutritional benefits, but might not be as versatile for cooking.

review/summary: Good oil, nifty packaging
review/text: This organic sunflower oil comes in light-weight tins with a very handy pop-off cap and pour spout. The combination of being light-weight and easy to pour makes it one of my favorite oil bottles to grab and use. The oil itself is pleasantly  mild-tasting. I use it occasionally for cooking, but mostly for oil-pulling in the mornings, and it seems to work well for both purposes. I like that the three pack allows you to buy more at once, but not a huge amount.<br /><br />Only drawback is that the light-weight tins can dent or squish easily and a couple of the bottles came misshapen. But that did not affect the quality of the product greatly, besides how nice it looked. (And they are cute-looking bottles).

review/text: I had to throw out almost all of these raisins because they contained crawly things and/or what looks like the droppings of crawly things. I must say I generally love Newman's products, and I was willing to give these raisins the benefit of the doubt. With natural products, sometimes bugs get in them. That's part of the territory with organic matter. But I found white grubs and little brown dots that weren't a part of the raisins in box after shrink-wrapped box. Some boxes were fine, and I ate the raisins in them, but the majority were tainted. I'll need to be assured there's been an improvement in quality control before I try Newman's snack-pack organic raisins again.

review/text: I am a huge fan of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but I've been trying to get away from conventional cereals and all the junk they contain. This is a great alternative. I have tried the similar variety from Cascadian Farm too and that is very similar to this. If you like lots of cinnamon that one is probably better. This is a more subtle cinnamon flavor, which isn't bad it just depends on your personal preference.<br /><br />However, Amazon's price is very high. They have this in a lot of regular grocery stores, and if you catch it on sale they can be $3 a box. They also have good coupons on the Mom's Best website so you can try it for less than Amazon even if it's not on sale.<br /><br />Great cereal!

review/text: I really can't say a lot more than Randy did; but I'll up his rating by a star.  This is because Swedish Meatballs with Pasta in Cream Sauce is the variety among those I've tried that rivals the meatloaf for flavor (which itself is shocking).<br /><br />Yeah, the meatballs are fairly tasty.  The noodles are "past al dente;" but not too bad.  What puts it over for me is a pretty good cream sauce with a polite bite of sourness (you can think a bit of Stoganoff).  The salt?  Well, I guess that's something these mass-audience prepared foods will always have.  They think salt sells.

review/text: The title pretty much says it all.<br /><br />I'm disabled, right, and occasionally I have a hard time moving around enough to get much more than cold cereal for a meal.  It's a little known fact that hot-meal deficiency can lead to an acute onset of Febris Casa or Furor Clausa (Cabin Fever and Closed-Up Crazies, respectively).<br /><br />ANYHOW...<br /><br />Just pop one of these little beauties in the microwave and in 90 seconds - maybe 100 - you have a hot, great tasting entr&eacute;e (North American usage).  If you add some microwavable veggies, you can produce an entire hot, well balanced meal in a single foray from your proverbial, "Bed of Pain."<br /><br />Now... MY 'Bed of Pain' is actually a bed, and the pain part is actually... well... you know... PAIN, but your Bed of Pain may be lack of time between work and your evening Cheese-Straightener Repair Class at the local Learning Annex, or Subito Furore Fames (Sudden Starvation Madness) brought on by chronic Amentia Artis Belli Orbis (Video Game Addiction - specifically: World of Warcraft).  Whatever it is that is driving you into an unhealthy deprivation of hot meals, this is your 90-second prophylaxis!<br /><br />I've been sampling these Hormel Completes, and all of them are worth having around!  My favorite, so far, is the 'Turkey and Hearty Vegetables' running neck-and-neck with the 'Salisbury Steak with Sliced Potatoes & Gravy'.  The ones with tomato sauce - the spaghetti and lasagna - are too sweet for my tastes, but I know lots of people who would do back-flips for them.<br /><br />I cannot encourage you enough to try these things!<br /><br />Umm... well... now that I think about it... I guess that I actually CAN, you know, as I've already probably encouraged you TOO MUCH to try them.  I'll stop typing now.<br /><br />SO:  The only big decisions left to me now is which of the three varieties of Hormel Completes I have in the pantry to have for lunch, and then whether to go back to bed or to fire up My Video Game of Choice.

review/text: If I HAD to eat this, I would. It's not the most awful thing I've ever eaten. It's acceptable as far as this sort of thing goes, and the noodles and sauce aren't too bad...but...the meatballs taste like alpo. I know that sounds harsh and you're probably asking how I would know what alpo tastes like, but if you have big brothers....lol...anyway, let's just say that the meatballs are mealy and squishy and don't resemble any sort of meat in any capacity. That said, it's not my favorite and I won't buy it again. Try the cheese manicotti--the ricotta and sauce are very tasty. The turkey and dressing is good--it's just that sliced lunchmeat-type turkey but you get two slices of it over the top of some fairly decent dressing. The dressing has diced waterchestnuts in it. The gravy is plain old gravy--as with all of these, don't expect gourmet sauces or quality. Overall, this is a cheap alternative to take-out on a busy day. All are full of salt and fat and all the stuff we're not supposed to have but hey, live a little. :)

review/text: The swedish meatballs with pasta in cream sauce is not one of the better ones nor is it one of the worst. There is a hint of sourness to the sauce (which is really more of a gravy than a pasta sauce) that puts me off and the meatballs only take away from the pasta rather than add. There's really no flavor to them at all; they are simply texture and that's it.<br /><br />For what this is -- a non-perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap -- it's pretty decent. It will fill you up quickly at very low effort and cost, but if you are going to compare it to something you can make yourself, well, there really isn't any comparison.<br /><br />** Contains both wheat and soy

It's not disgusting and comes in handy if you do not have anything else to eat, but not delicious.  After tasting this one I decided to stop ordering Compleats all together. I wind up giving about 20 dinners away. It was not worth me keeping. The only one I can say I did like was the Turkey Dinners. just after too many of them the taste starts to really make you gag. Everyone's palate is different and mine did not enjoy these dinners too much. The only one I can say I did like was the Turkey Dinner. just after too many the taste starts to really make you think twice.

All Smokehouse products were recalled in 2007, 'PetSmart has pulled various Smokehouse Brand dog treats off of their shelves. There have been reports of pets becoming ill after eating the treats, and as a precaution, PetSmart has removed the products.' Better research your pets food before you feed them if you want them to be around for awhile. Better to pay a little more than feeding your pet God only know what!

review/text: These treats are great as a special treat to give sometimes.  Amazon is usually the cheapest place to buy them.  The dogs seem to digest them well. I was hoping it would take my dogs longer to chew up, but they like them so well they just crunch them up quickly.  I don't really care for the other smokehouse products I've tried, but this one's a winner.

review/summary: First batch was great
review/text: I ordered these kabobs for my very picky Havanese. I used them as his special bedtime treat (after teeth brushing).  The kabobs in the first six bags I ordered looked just like the picture (like chicken treats wrapped around a stick) and my dog loved them.  The sticks in the first two batches were about 4 inches long and I broke the treats in half.  I just received my third batch of three bags.  They look horrible and nothing like the picture (in fact they don't even look like chicken!).  The sticks are about 2 to 2-1/2 inches long (not long enough to break).  My dog turned his nose up at what used to be his very favorite bedtime treat.  What makes it worse, is that when I read the description on the bag, there's a warning to wash your hands after handling and something about the treats being exposed to radiation for your safety.  I have no idea what that means, but safety and radiation in the same sentence seems contradictory to me and a bit scary, and of course I don't have the bags from the first orders to compare to this most recent order.  I will not order these treats again.  What a shame.

review/summary: Smaller Than I'd Hoped
review/text: My dogs love these, but they definitely are smaller than I'd hoped.  I have a pair of 2 month old lab/pit mix girls, entering a teething stage. As such, I wanted a harder treat for them.  They absolutely love the flavor and texture, but I worry about them choking, as they're really quite small (maybe 3 inches long).  As such, I'm giving them to my pups far more frequently than I'd hoped - I don't dare give them these treats once they get even a bit larger.  I don't regret the purchase, as they definitely are an enjoyable treat, as displayed by how quickly they get demolished.  However, I really wish there was a breed sizing advisement in the product's description.<br /><br />In short - great product, but not for anything by smaller breed dogs.

I have tried other Smokehouse products with him (specifically Chicken Poppers) with equal success.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Only fragments, no whole leaf
review/text: I purchased 4 boxes of these from Costco. Uncle Lee's tea is part of a well known tea company in China, Ten Fu, which was founded by the founder of the renowned Ten Ren tea company in Taiwan. Many years ago Ten Ren came up with the whole leaf tea bag idea. The tea bags had whole leaves (bag grew larger as it brewed) and the teas tasted quite good. I thought this product is probably similar to that yet manufactured by a different company. WRONG! The teas are tasteless, and there is no whole leaf! How did I find out about it? One of the tea (paper) bags was not completely sealed and the tea leaves (fragments) were partially out. In the same box where this particular tea bag was housed, there was another sealed package with no tea bag in it, just air! Buyers beware.

The flavors are really distinctive from each other, they don't all<br /><br />  taste the same - red really tastes like cherry and yellow really<br /><br />  tastes like lemon<br /><br />  3.

review/text: The jaw breakers I remember from my childhood are getting increasingly difficult to find.  These jaw breakers are the old fashioned kind, not too big (sometimes a problem when I was a kid), last a long time and aren't too sweet.  They have the usual selection of flavors, orange, cherry, grape, lemon, lime.  I like them all except the lemon which is too bitter.  The cherry and orange are my favorites.  I find I can eat one of these at night and be satisfied versus a chewy candy which seems to lead naturally from one to half a bag.

review/text: We have enjoyed Fernwood mint sandwiches for years!  They are the perfect combination of chocolate and mint, and these literally melt in your mouth.  The quality of chocolate they use is what makes these so unique: it surpasses any other chocolates I've tasted in the U.S. or even in Europe.  Fernwood mint sandwiches are absolutely nothing like the other brands of chocolate-mints that frankly taste like plastic to me.  We give Fernwood mint sandwiches as gifts to our friends on various holidays, and universally people tell us they're the best chocolates they've ever tasted.  I am SO excited to see Fernwood on Amazon now, and I am confident that as people become familiar with their mint sandwich, they will become a best-seller on Amazon.  Trust me, they are THAT good.  You really do have to try them to believe how good they taste!

review/text: If your green tea isn't green, it's overly oxidized and probably doesn't taste great but also lacks the majority of the antioxidants the tea is known for.  Try cutting open one of your tea bags...more like brown tea.<br /><br />The Rishi Super Green is my favorite tea and reasonably priced.  I've tried a handful of premium green teas imported from Japan on a very small scale.  These were all very good, but also quite expensive.  I am far from a tea expert, but after drinking the super green I can't even drink the tsao, lipton or bigelow teas any more.  Give this stuff a try, it won't disappoint.

review/summary: OMG, talk about being green!
review/text: Wow, I was stunned to see the color of the tea after brewing. I used just 1 teaspoonful of tea leaves in my tea pot and added hot water just enough to fill up to regular-sized coffee cup that I use for 12 oz of coffee. The leaves produced unbelievably sparky fresh green color that green tea should look like, but I forgot how it should be as not many green teas sold can achieve this color! It was strong enough to add some more hot water later on to make a full 12 oz cup full of green tea. But one caution is that real green tea is very easy and fast to be oxidized if left in the air. Once it oxidized, you can see it as the color of green changes to brown, and it has reverse effect of the benefit of green tea in that case. SO, make sure to keep your tin can as tight all the time, and close the lid as soon as possible. After brewing the tea, drink it as soon as possible but of course don't force yourself to manage burn to your mouth!!

review/summary: Excellent and affordable premium Japanese tea blend
review/text: This is a great Japanese green.  As noted on the front of the package it is a loose leaf blend of sencha leaves spiked with matcha powder.  Taste compares favorably with much more expensive sencha blends I have purchased from importers, with the characteristic grassy flavor of fresh greens.  And the ability to order this online from Amazon is awesome.<br /><br />Some people appear to have rated this product low because they were looking for matcha powder to "put in shakes".  This is not for "putting in shakes" and anyone who spent a minute researching Japanese tea should be able to figure that out.  If you want the nuance and pleasure of a true premium green you have to steep it yourself and you have to use loose leaf tea.  You also have to use the right temperature of water (less than boiling) and steep for the right amount of time.  This stuff is solid gold--cast not your pearls before swine.<br /><br />I am just glad rishi is out there making excellent accessible teas like this one.  Worth spending a little more (and spending a little more time preparing) a tea that will not disappoint.

review/summary: Good tea but really deceptive packaging
review/text: This tea is very good, but the packaging is quite deceptive. To begin with, it is not powdered matcha tea, but a leaf tea that is a blend (you can see that it is a blend if you look at the smaller print on the can, but it is a bit misleading). In addition, the tea only fills about a third and maybe even as little as a fourth of the container once you remove it from the bag inside the can. I would buy it again because it is very good tea, but don't buy it if you are looking for matcha and be aware that you're getting less than it might seem.

At first I hated it but it is OK now after several cups of it. However I will continue my search for another brand that is more like a powder.  My first Matcha purchase was 2nd Harvest Organic DO Matcha and I liked that one I was just hoping to find a cheaper alternative online but if I strike out again I will most likely go back to my first try.

review/summary: Acceptable aroma, but lacks in appearance.
review/text: I could smell the authentic basmati aroma as soon as i opened the bag, and it kept the aroma when it was cooked. However, I felt like this had more starch content due to constant cloudiness of the water when washing the rice compared to other brands, and the outcome wasn't as "pure-tasting." Lastly, I personally look for cooked grains with nicely elongated shape which this rice was a bit shorter, and fatter compared to other brands. I wouldn't mind finishing it up, but wouldn't subscribe to it.

I cannot tell you how impressed I am with the rice.

This gets top ratings in my book and I will buy again.

review/text: I love this rice, it is fluffy and has a nice smell, sorta like popcorn popping. It is a verry long grain and it seprates from each other. Makes a perfect rice for Curry and the leftovers are great for Chinese Fried Rice. You must follow directions and let rice soak 15 minutes after cleaning it, but in 15 more minutes you have fluffy perfect rice. For the Latinos out there it makes good "Con Con" on the bottom of pan. 5 stars, I also like the bag it comes in, it zips up and you can hang it on a door knob or whatever you want.

review/text: We like Basmati rice but find it either (1) pretty expensive in the supermarket or (2) in too big a quantity (often 20 lb.) at warehouse stores. This was a good compromise - decent price and not too much to store/use in a reasonable time, plus the two bag pkg will make it easy to share with family or friend. I can't really tell one Basmati from another, but this seems at least as good as any we've had. Followed cooking directions exactly and it came out perfect.

review/text: My family left Asia, so that we can eat Asian food imported to the USA.  Even more ironic that I'm in San Francisco, and I have to order from Amazon.com, rice that was imported to San Francisco, and have it shipped back to San Francisco.<br /><br />As far as rice goes, this is pretty expensive.  Asian markets sell rice for much less.  But if you're in the middle of some place without an Asian market, then this is a great deal.<br /><br />Some say they can tell the difference between different types of rice.  Supposedly, rice is like wine, coffee, et cetera.  A lot of different fragrances, taste, and textures.  I'm not that sophisticated.  But it works for me when I serve it with a stir fry.  The next day, I take the leftover rice & leftover stir fry, and make a fried rice.

review/text: I loved Heinz tomato soup as a child until it suddenly disappeared.  Campbell's was horrible, so I didn't have any tomato soup until a visit to England recently.  In a cafeteria I saw Heinz tomato soup.  I ordered some and it was really good, just the way I remembered it!  I also suddenly realized what the difference was between Campbell's and Heinz -  it was sugar!  When I got home I confirmed this by adding sugar to Campbell's - one packet (3.5 g) of sugar completely changed the flavor to something very similar to Heinz.  Still, it's great to have the real thing from time to time even if the cost is 4X!
