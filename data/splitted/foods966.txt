review/text: Our family LOVES these.  We've tried several brands and this is by far the favorite.  Over the last year, they are getting harder and harder to find.  If you can get them - try them!!!  I'm going to start ordering them by the case!  Both my kids get to pick their dinner on their birthday night and both of them request these potato pancakes every year.  I need to be stocked.

review/summary: Good basic rootbeer
review/text: If you're a fan of craft rootbeer, like Virgil's, this might be a little too simple for your palate but I like this a lot.  It's sweetened with cane sugar and not over-carbonated; it goes down smooth and, for a drink with so much cream, it's actually refreshing.  Not a fan of their natural cola, but I think they got it right here.

review/text: After discovering PG tips on Amazon, I was on the hunt for all my favourite home comforts (not great for the diet, but heh, you only live once and I wouldnt otherwise get them until I head home for a trip).  So for great price and convenience, this is one of my favourite sweet (candy) - combination of chocolate and honeycomb sweetness, light yet mourishly delicious.  I am not kidding.

review/summary: Great Candy Usually But Not From this Seller
review/text: I sure wish this was sold in the USA, but I haven't found it yet.  It's a delicious candy, but unfortunately my candy was discolored and old.  I never heard back about trying to get a refund or exchange, so I guess I'm out of luck.  I did order it during the month of June, but it's typically not that hot in June here, so I thought I was safe to order it then.  I doubt that I'll order from this vendor again since I never heard back from them.  I suppose ordering during Winter would be the way to go, but the climate in CA is never predictable, so it's a difficult thing to predict when it might be safe to order/ship.  From the looks of the discolored chocolate and the partially good and partially bad inner part of the candy, I am not sure what happened ... only that I'm out the money, and I had to throw away a lot of the product.  The low rating is due to the poor condition the candy arrived in (stale insides, discolored chocolate) and due to the poor customer service (or perhaps I should say NO customer service).  Otherwise, IF in good condition, this candy rates a 5.  Buy it somewhere else that will give you support and definitely buy cooler times of the year (as another reviewer wrote).  I was so disheartened by the lack of support that I forgot to write a review.  Sorry if my tardiness caused another buyer to suffer the same fate as I.

review/text: My British husband introduced me to this candy bar since they're not readily available in the United States, but they are now one of my favorites. When I saw they were available on Amazon, I was so excited and they were really inexpensive. However, when they box arrived, the bars had completely melted since it wasn't delivered until the end of the day on a very hot June day in Texas. They had ice gel packs included in the packaging but that was no match for a hot Texas summer. I think whoever shipped it should have specified that this package could not be left on a delivery truck all day in the sun.

review/summary: Wonderful licorice!
review/text: My 5-year-old daughter is allergic to every artificial food color so it is difficult to find treats that are tasty and dye-free. This licorice has an excellent natural strawberry flavor. The pieces are a smaller size, which is nice for a child's portion. My only negative is that the texture is a little harder than what you've come to expect with your non-organic full-of-dye licorice, but I found myself gladly chewing a little longer for the wonderful flavor. Besides, it's not a bad thing to have to take a little longer to eat a piece of candy! I'm back to try the raspberry next.

They remind me of my childhood, before they started adding all the high fructose this and that to products. Best of all, I can actually for the first time in my life eat a piece of licorice and not be sick! I know some gluten free items don't meet up to the expectations and taste of the "regular" stuff. TRY THESE!! They will be on your shopping list all the time and anyone who is on a gluten free diet will LOVE to be sent this treat! Make sure you have enough for yourself as you won't want to be without it.

review/summary: More like shoe laces
review/text: We recently discovered my daughter has food alergies. Since before Halloween, I've been trolling the internet looking for candy that she can eat. She loves chocolate but it's not enough variety. When I saw these I got very excited because she's wanted to try twizzlers but can't. Fortunately, I tried them first. There is a very faint taste of strawberry-like flavor but what little flavor I was able to crush out of these things was not worth the work my jaws had to put in to get it. Even as I write this, having tossed the package away 20 minutes ago, I have a rather nasty after-taste even Lifebouy might not get out. Nice story on the packaging about how the company came about but the story is far more satisfying than the product. No thank you.

review/text: Hard, tough, pasty aftertaste. Like gnawing on a rubber hose but with a less pleasant flavor. Somewhere in the back of that just woke up in the morning and scraped it off your teeth taste there was a lingering strawberryish flavor. An unripe and turned slightly bad strawberryish flavor with not a hint of sweetness. These were awful. So bad I couldn't swallow the bite I took. It was such a disappointment since I was really excited to get these after Runningrabbit stopped making the good stuff. If I fed these to my kids they would report me to CPS. I want to pull them out of the package and whip the CEO with them as punishment. If I'd never had candy in my life these would still taste terrible! Did I mention they aren't good.? Seriously, if you are looking for something that tastes anything like a red vine or any type of licorice this isn't it.

review/summary: Hodgson Mill Barley Bread
review/text: I am so totally satisfied by Hodgson Mill products & I probably have purchased > 100 loaves at this point.  I used some as a present to my brother with good results, too.<br /><br />Never have I seen "old" smelling mix nor have I ever had a yeast failure.  Their taste & texture is wonderful. Never have I had a "slicing failure" where you can't get a slice to hold together long enough to lay it down. The different types lend themselves well to adding ingredients such as Chopped Nuts or Sesame Seeds or Millet Seed or - - use your own imagination.  Coming in nice units of 6 loaves makes pantry storage easy, and once opened, the carton yields 6 boxes with "Best By" dates easily accessible on each so rotating your shelf stock is almost "goof-proofed".<br /><br />Next time you walk a grocery store, note the prices there! Here again, I think you really can't beat the quality with a really fair price that Hodgson provides.  It seems to me that they have expended great effort to have the best product they can produce & the best shipping available for their customers.<br /><br />Buy with great confidence based on my experiences with them during the last 2-3 years.  I hope this helps decision making.

review/text: I see that there are presently 30 reviews for this Hodgson Mill Barley Bread Mix, so why, you may ask, do we need another?<br /><br />Glad you asked. I ordered this bread for a few reasons:<br /><br />1) To save a few bucks over store bought<br /><br />2) To always have on hand in pantry<br /><br />3) To enjoy the aroma of fresh baked bread in my home<br /><br />When it was time to bake this bread, I proofed the yeast & it bubbled up.  Just what you want to see. I kneaded the dough for the time stated, & covered it as instructed. When I checked it after 1 1/2 hrs., it had not risen at all, yet I had done all the right things. So I punched it down, fitted it flat onto a quarter size sheet pan, sprinkled it w/rosemary, garlic, black pepper & extra virgin olive oil.<br /><br />It turned out a delicious flatbread, but what went wrong?<br /><br />I called Hodgson Mill, turns out my house temp. of 64 degrees is good for the heat bill but not for bread. The rep was great, told me to preheat oven to 200 deg. for 2 min. then turn off oven. Let dough rise in oven.<br /><br />Great bread mix, fast delivery by Amazon, fair price & great customer service. I am sold.<br /><br />Just ordered more. You should too.  Enjoy your bread.

Also, for those interested, Hodgson is the ONLY brand certified by a GM agency not to contain ANY GM products.

review/text: This was our first experience with Barley bread and we rate it above overage.  It does have a distinctive yet acceptable taste. It does not taste like barley! It loses it's soft, freshness within a few days, but meets our desire for a heavier bread, particularly for sopping up graveys or dipping in soup.  We like it and will continue to order it when we're not looking for a boring "sandwich" bread.

review/text: I have been using Hodgson's MIll bread mixes in my breadmaker for years.  I like to add various seeds and grains as well.<br /><br />I just figured out how to make thin buns (great for portion control) using these mixes:<br />I use the dough only setting on the breadmaker, which does everything but bake it.<br />Then I punch down the dough, form into kind of a round, then cut into 16 pieces (first in half, then half those pieces, and so on.)<br />Then roll each piece into a flat disc about 4 inches wide, and let them rise again for 30 minutes under a clean dishcloth on the baking sheet.<br />Bake for 10-15 minutes at 350' and you got 'em.<br /><br />I don't grease the sheet because I use a silicone pan liner.  I also roll the dough on the same liner so there is no need for flour.

review/summary: Hearty and tasty bread
review/text: This bread is substantial in texture, hearty and very tasty.  It has a mild and rather nutty flavor, not a "dark" flavor like whole wheat bread.  It is so good you don't really need butter (though butter does go great with it).  I make it in my Panasonic bread machine, at the 1� lb, light crust setting, and it always comes out perfect.

review/summary: Love, love, love this bread mix!
review/text: Homemade bread is awesome if you love the taste of fresh bread and want to save money. I own a bread machine which quickly paid for itself, but even making it by hand is well worth it. I was making bread from scratch but for some reason I get better results from bread mixes such as this one. At less than $2 for a loaf, it's very inexpensive, especially with Amazon's subscribe & save deal. I like foods with short ingredients lists, so you know exactly what's going into your food and your body, without a lot of chemicals and preservatives. This bread has a lot of fiber, iron, and vitamin C. It says on the package to use 2 Tbsp. of butter, margarine, or vegetable oil for a 1 1/2 lb. loaf, but instead of that I use 3 Tbsp. of olive oil and it turns out better. I might never buy bread from the store again.

review/summary: Wonderful bread
review/text: I am the director of nurses at a Long Term Care facility and we cook a loaf of this bread in a bread machine everyday.  It's comforting, home-like aroma fills the place as well as stimulates the appetites of the residents;  many of whom don't care if they eat or not.  We slice it up in small pieces and pass it out.  They love it.  Has a wonderful taste and texture. Almost every loaf turns out perfect.  If you like good, wholesome bread, you will love this brand.  The same goes for the Cheese & Herb bread by the same company. Absolutely Great.  A real "Bread Winner".(:o)

review/summary: Wonderfull Bread!
review/text: Freshly baked bread is one of my favorite things, and Hodgson Mill makes it so easy -- and inexpensive -- to have on a regular basis.  Barley bread sounded odd to me, but I'm so glad I tried it.  It has the rich, satisfying taste you associate with whole grain breads, but is a little lighter than their 9 grain bread mix in both color and taste.<br /><br />Grocery store bread is expensive, and cannot begin to compare with the taste and nutritional value of Hodgson Mill breads, so not only am I enjoying myself, I am saving money.  How often does that happen?

review/text: never having barley bread before I thought I'd give it a try since it got great reviews. the reviews were right this is very good bread I love it. my first loaf didn't rise very well, but that was my fault I didn't have the water at the right temp so the yeast didn't do its job. my second loaf turned out great, it had a nice crust not hard it had a nice color and it had a very nice texture, not heavy like some breads and had a great flavor. I will definitely be buying this bread mix again.

review/text: I am what you could say a coffee drinker. I have been drinking coffee since I was 15 years of age, when I had my moms permission to drink it at the time. I am 53 now. We are a family of coffee drinkers. I have been going to Panera's  about a year now. I have come to love their dark roast coffee. I too was a Starbucks fan and drank a lot of their coffee. I then tasted Seattle's best and preferred drinking their coffee for years. But now I prefer the Panera's dark roast coffee over both. It has a more full flavor and smooth at the same time. It does not make me feel that I have to much caffeine in me . But some people like the caffeine hyper feeling. Do not get me wrong. I still drink Starbucks coffee, but I do it for the convenience. Everywhere I go there is a Starbucks around. If their was a Panera near by I would choose Panera though. Just my humble opinion.

review/text: Our Chihuahua was raised on Royal Canin Medi Cal as a puppy but after switching to the adolescent, her coat started drying out and she was scratching a lot more.  I thought it might be the food so switched over to the breed specific Royal Canin Chihuahua and it made a huge difference!  She would barely touch the adolescent food but she loves the RCC28.  After only going through one 2lb bag, her coat is already back and the itching has stopped.  Well worth it.  The other option to try was the Hills Science Diet for small dogs (a lot cheaper) but I know RCC28 works so will stick with it.  The only annoying thing is that it's made in Canada, I'm Canadian but buying it is cheaper in the USA.  Go figure.

I found these Primal Spirit Meatless Sticks on Amazon and took my chances.  Usually a vegetarian product trying to imitate meat falls far short when it comes to texture.  These have the texture of a Slim Jim and have a nice spice to them.  Since ordering them, I have also ordered several other of the Primal Spirit products.  These are, by far, my favorites.  They scratch that itch for us one-time meat eaters.

review/summary: my kid loves these
review/text: I adoped a (now 6) year old who used to eat a lot of meat and jerky. I have gotten him to try a variety of faux jerky,  and this is the only one he'll eat. He really loves them. (I'm not a jerky fan, so I can't review them myself.)

review/summary: Incredible superfood.
review/text: I eat at least one of these each day, sometimes for breakfast, sometimes for lunch. Imagine taking all of the best parts of one of those slim-jim type snacks, but then removing the grease, the gristle, the animal products, the chemicals and the aftertaste. You would be left with these.<br /><br />I prefer these smoked sticks to the Pepperoni, they have a nicer taste to me, but both are excellent. The size, 1.5 ounce is perfect as well, not too big, not too small.

review/summary: Not quite what I hoped for.
review/text: I have bought and enjoyed the other Primal products, so I thought that I would give these a whirl. Overall flavor is not bad, I just find these dry and kind of blah. They do not have the intense flavor of the Primal jerkies. I suppose the other thought is that perhaps different lots or batches of these products are better than others, who knows what the quality control in Taiwan is comprised of? These items are very difficult to open without a knife or scissors, so don't plan on opening away from home. Overall they seem a bit too dry, they actually break apart as you try to remove them from the package. Pros: Another Veggie option for us. Cons: Hard to open, only okay flavor and a bit on the dry side.

review/summary: Vegetarian and delicious
review/text: These Primal Spirit Meatless Sticks are vegetarian and delicious.  They have a sweet pepperoni favor (I haven't tried the smoked favor yet).  They are almost a foot long and � inch across.  Contrary to what some reviewers are saying, the sticks I got are moist and soft, not dry and chalky.  Perhaps I was just lucky.  They taste and have a texture just like their meat counterparts.  That proves vegetarians can eat well and show compassion to hapless animals at the same time.

review/summary: Not pepperoni-like, dried out, awful
review/text: I love the primal strips jerky, and when I saw these I thought even if they didn't taste anything like pepperoni they would still be good.  I was wrong.  The flavor profile is off, the texture so dry you need glasses and glasses of water just to eat half of one strip. I even tried eatig one after the gym and then it was only palatable, not good.  Since we bought a box, we're going to save the rest for hikes and back-packing. But I wouldn't advise gettig unless u like the texture of tree bark.

review/text: The ONLY con is that the individual packets are difficult to open.<br />I can't comprehend the criticism on price as these are nearly a FOOT<br />long and quite filling. I have not eaten meat in decades...yet I think<br />they have done a reasonable job in taste as well.  Maybe I am not as picky<br />as other consumers...yet I find little here not to like.  I will<br />be getting these again.  I have PRIME (a great investment I believe)<br />so no shipping cost is involved and the large pack breaks down to<br />$1.45 each. I also received my order in two days!<br />I intend to try the smoked flavor as well.<br />Bon appetit.

review/text: I really liked this product; it was a tad spicy and had fantastic texture (although it is a bit dry). However, it certainly is NOT worth any of the prices asked. Unfortunately, due to this product being a specialty, it makes it difficult to obtain through other means. Overall, great product, disappointing pricing for what you get.

review/summary: BLECH!
review/text: These would be great if it weren't for the awful taste and texture. :P<br />The texture lacks any sort of stringy interior or snappy exterior that would make these similar to a Slim Jim. Instead, the texture just has this kind of grainy, mushy-yet-firm thing going on. I could forgive that with no problems if it weren't for the downright awful taste. The closest thing I can think of to compare it to would be cardboard with lots of black pepper in it. I'd rather eat plain tofu than these sticks. I don't know how Primal Spirit managed to mess these up so bad when their other stuff is so good. I highly recommend getting Primal Spirit Meatless Jerky instead of Primal Spirit Meatless Flavor Sticks. They are two completely different products.

I tried a few but these are what reminded me the most and to me tasted exactly like I remember a slim jim tasted. I ate the two I bought to taste and now eneded up buy the whole 24 pack. I liked the regular smoked flavor more than the pepperonnie. AWESOME a must have for vegetarian who liked slim jim or jerky

review/text: These are absolutely awful. I like Stonewall's Jerkee, and Tofurky Jerky, and even normal Primal Sticks aren't bad... so I thought these would be right up my alley. They taste terrible and have an awful texture. It's like eating spiced crumbly rubber -- I couldn't get a whole one down but even if I could, I wouldn't feel safe eating it because it feels like it would take forever to be digested. I'm embarrassed that my desire for vegan jerky was so gluttonous that I spent so much on things that ended up so terrible!

review/text: I bought these based on the good reviews of others and was disappointed.  They are way over seasoned which I find the case with many veg sausage or jerky products.  The texture was not bad though they break easily.  Since I used to eat meat (about eight years or so ago) I know what a meat stick would normally taste like.  This is not it.  It may be the slight sweet taste throwing it off, I'm not sure.  Now I have another 23 sticks left to figure it out I guess.

I can always drive down to Penzey Spice store and get fresh, good quality spice. If too lazy, order online.

review/summary: J. Wilbur Hickory Smoke BBQ Sauce
review/text: I use BBQ Sauce very sparingly, that said, the little that I apply to my finished BBQ product as a final "glaze" must be outstanding.  In my opinion, this sauce has a great consistency, not too watery where it sticks quite nicely to the meat.  Unfortunately, they added (liquid smoke essence) to the ingredients.  If one is using a wood fired- charcoal smoker/grill, why would anyone want to add more smoke flavoring?  I guess if your take on BBQ is par-cooking the meat ahead of time, and using a Gas Grill as your "Pit", perhaps this product would work fine.  My personal favorite BBQ Sauce of late, is Refus Teagues.  Hope Amazon eventually starts to carry it.

review/summary: Not A Natural or Organic Item
review/text: I was searching for a natural or organic BBQ sauce, and this brand popped up.  I was really disappointed to see that one of the main ingredients was High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I am a 3rd year medical student, and HFCS is something I try to avoid as it really is quite bad for one's health.<br /><br />At any rate, my complaint is largely with the fact that the sauce appeared as organic, when it is absolutely not.  As far as the taste, I thought it was good, but not necessarily $8.00 good.  I would not order it again.

review/summary: Purina Cat Chow for "The Fuzz."
review/text: We have two cats, both neutered males that are totally indoor cats. One is a large black and white longhair we call "The Fuzz." He's six. The other is a medium-sized. solid medium-gray shorthair who resembles a Russian Blue. We call him Boris and he's five. It's difficult to satisfy their needs for food. The Fuzz is somewhat fussy and always seems to be hungry, although he's the proper weight. Boris will eat anything and is a specialist at licking plates clean. He's thin and slinky. However, Boris has a condition wherein he develops urinary tract crystals and has to be fed an expensive prescription cat food to remain healthy. It works, I might add. As such, they have to be fed separately.<br /><br />We've settled in on Purina Cat Chow (Indoor Formula) for The Fuzz. He seems to like it better than any of the others and it's easy to find and it's cheap. His health has been perfect. We're very satisfied with it, as is The Fuzz. Boris is satisfied with his prescription diet. Unfortunately, The Fuzz likes it too and it's five times as expensive as his regular food so we have to keep them separated during the feeding times twice a day. What a pain. It seems ironic that the one who is fussy gets along on the cheap food and the one who will eat anything placed before him needs expensive prescription food. Go figure. Such is life with cats.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
