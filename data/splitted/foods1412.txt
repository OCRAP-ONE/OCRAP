review/summary: Sweet and Lovely Tea
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Licorice Spice Caffeine Free Herbal Tea has a the sweet flavor licorice teas are known for, along with several nice spices that complement the licorice in a lovely, more-subtle-than-chai way. Licorice Spice Tea contains licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor, natural orange flavor, natural clove flavor, natural cardamom flavor, and natural cinnamon flavor. Sweet and delicious!<br /><br />You don't need to add anything at all to Licorice Spice Tea, even if you normally like your tea sweetened. It is perfect just as is. It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I was a little skeptical after looking at the list of ingredients, but I decided to give this tea a try anyway.  I'm glad I did.  It's a delicious, sweet-tasting blend that's good both hot and iced.  I went through about a box a week; everyone I've served it to has enjoyed it.

review/summary: Yum for Yumberry!
review/text: I don't think I ever heard of "yumberry" flavor before, but it is yummy!  As I have said before, I am a big time tea drinker and Stash makes excellent teas.<br /><br />This one has a smooth, fruity, berry taste and is sweet and delicious.  It would be great served alone, after dinner, or with a piece of good quality cheesecake.  Although I am drinking it warm, it would likely taste great as an ice tea, too.<br /><br />If you want to sweeten it, I suggest natural brown sugar, honey, or agave cactus juice (natural food isle in supermarket).  For this one, I used 2 bags for 24 oz hot water.<br /><br />As with all Stash teas, each bag is sealed in its own foil pouch to protect its delicate flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients, in order listed, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, yumberry flavor, chicory root, blackcurrant flavor, blackcurrant powder, and licorice powder.  Contains soy.  It is a 100 % natural, herbal, caffeine free product.

review/text: Best chamomile on the mainstream supermarket shelves. Other chamomile teas have had a bitter aftertaste, but this one by Stash is really smooth and fresh. It's neither strong nor bland, just floral and pleasant. Reminds me slightly of chrysanthemum. It doesn't make me sleepy or keep me up, for what it's worth. I had some primo stuff at a local coffeeshop that tasted much like the Stash brand, but had an awesome citrusy floral aroma; been wanting to find something like that for a while, and so far this Stash Chamomile comes closest.

review/text: This tea is really tasty...I wasn't even a tea person until tasting this, and once I did, I was hooked. The flavor is light and super-refreshing but you can still taste and smell the mint. The only reason why I took off one star is because I tend to like things that taste strongly, and this one is a little bit delicate for me. To remedy that, I either steep it with hibiscus or black tea, or I steep it at double strength and all is well.<br />Putting it with honey and stevia also tastes great, and makes me feel better when I have colds. I love this tea!

review/text: This is the first camomile tea that actually maintains the most of the medicinal properties of camomile!! So far it is the best out of five different brands we got to try in USA including various organic, so called farmaceutic quality, etc.. To give a specific example of this tea's well-preserved qualities: it really helps us get rid of extra water in our bodies, nearly as good as "water pills"  doctors recommend. One packet in a small cup does great.. And can be repeated if you need.  We have subscribed to receive it from Amazon on a regular basis - the price is better then in a supermarket.

review/summary: Absolutely the best tea I've ever had
review/text: I'm not a big tea drinker. I keep buying different types of tea convinced I'll like them, and each one turns out to be completely different than I anticipated. In other words, I think all teas taste generally the same: like hot water. Even with sugar - then they taste like hot water with sugar. But this tea is completely different.<br /><br />I love licorice. This tastes exactly like licorice. It smells like licorice (clearly from the anise, since licorice root basically smells like cooked bark). It doesn't need sugar. It's sweet. It has an 'aftertaste' of licorice. In other words, it's perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately no store I've ever been to has carried it, although I look EVERY TIME I walk down the tea aisle. Even if they did, it wouldn't be that awesome, since this is pretty much the same exact price it would go for in, say, Target. Unfortunately it is 6 boxes...but I really don't think you can have enough of this stuff.<br /><br />After some trial-and-error, I can now say that, of the few other licorice teas that do exist, nothing really comes close to Stash. I've tried a weird Celestial tea  mix of  licorice root + 3 other things (tastes like hot water), Batavia Anise tea (hot water with a licorice aroma), and store brand Albrecht Heijn Zoethout tea (from the Netherlands - smells like hot bark but tastes exactly like this tea. Unfortunately it's completely nonexistent here.) What I've discovered on my quest fs that only a few brands even attempt to make JUST licorice tea (it's not popular here, and it baffles me that people don't appreciate the taste), and of those only Stash is successful.<br /><br />Buy it. Amazon is a good deal and it's soooo good.

review/text: Well, I understand that since it is Licorice Spice tea it would have some licorice smell and taste, but it is just too much for me. If you use 1 bag of it in your cup you are getting light yellow liquid with a very strong licorice taste and smell. I am using it in a tea pot mixing with other teas then it is working better.

review/summary: Different and Tasty
review/text: I am a tea drinker from way back and Stash is an excellent tea.  This flavor has a smooth strawberry/pomegranate taste and is delicious.  It is a red tea (red in colour) and red because its primary ingredient is Rooibos, which is red tea and is slightly sweet.  Also included (in this order) are rosehips, hibiscus flowers, raspberry leaves, citric acid, and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour.<br /><br />I did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients.  This info is what I found reported in a few different sources:<br /><br />Rooibus tea:<br />Rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have 50 times more antioxidant power than green tea. It also has other antioxidants not found in other teas.  The effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in Rooibus tea.  Rooibus tea is completely pure and natural .  It contains no additives, preservatives or colorant.  It is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension.  It has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system.  Rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.  It has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants.  It also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, hearrtburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. It supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and flouride, and it contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid. I was also told that red tea does not have ECOG, a healthful property that green tea does have. That is why I drink both red tea and green tea, to get the best of all worlds.<br /><br />Rosehips is supposed to be good for infections, bladder problems, and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin C.<br />Hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic (fluid release) and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />If I had only two words to describe the taste of this tea, they would be fruity and smooth.  It is also caffeine free.  It is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after-dinner comfort drink.  Stash makes a good full bodied tea, stronger than some of these cheapie teas, so I find I only need one bag per a 24 oz cup. (Of course, that all depends on your preference.)  These special Stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display.<br /><br />BTW--I am not a doctor--(my disclaimer)--just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care.  As with any product, consult your health cae provider, especially if you are on medications.

I've tasted quite a few cinnamon-apple teas and this one is my favorite. There is not too much cinnamon and just enough apple flavor. It is even more delicious when sweetened with a huckleberry honey. You will want to drink this tea while decorating for Christmas or while eating a piece of cake.

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry Delight
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: What's With the Weird Sensation Seconds After Sipping?
review/text: I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor "blossomed" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea "dances around the sides of your tongue."  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the "flavor burst", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The "flavor burst" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil.

review/summary: Stashed Premium Chamomile Herbash
review/text: After a lengthy trek in the Himalayan Range, the Himalayas, or Himalayalabalyakamonkatonka for short, in Tibetan, (a mountain range in Asia, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau), I was in bad shape.  First of all, my scrotum shrunk from the extended lack of healthy oxygen.  Secondly, I had all sorts of intestinal problems due to my diet of yak meat only.  Thirdly, I had plenty of holes in my socks and underpants.<br /><br />I eventually made it to a small town in China where I visited the local Apothecary.  A man, if I recall correctly, by the name of Ying Yang Ping Pong Luke, recommended Chamomile Herbal Tea.  I had often heard of the healing properties of it in old and ancient Zulu scripts (pictographic and ideographic) but had never tried it since I despised teas.<br /><br />Well, after a few months on a Chamomile Herbal Tea only diet plus brown rice, I was fixed up.  Chamomiles are medicinal plants.  They are  emmenagogues, stomachics, carminatives, diaphoretics, antispasmodics, and sedatives.<br /><br />In my case, Chamomile Herbal Tea fought intestinal gas and stimulated my gastric juices and encouraged my appetite.<br /><br />Stash Premium Chamomile Herbal Tea is very weak so some won't like it.  I do because you can drink a nice hot cup before bed and it helps you.  It has no flavor aside from a bitter taste of weed but again, I think of it more as a comfort Tea than something pleasurable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HFBMQ">Neti Pot Starter Kit with 1.5 Oz Aromatic Salt Original Neti Pot Salt</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I21K18">Adagio Teas PersonaliTea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket</a><br /><br />Nature's Way - Chamomile Flowers, 350 mg, 100 capsules

review/summary: The best tasting hibiscus tea!
review/text: My local grocery store didn't carry it anymore and due to the large amounts of coffee I drink, I like to detox from time to time using this tea. The hibiscus is great for your kidneys.<br />The flavor is great hot or cold. If you are wondering what this tastes like, if you have tried Starbucks' "Berry Berry Hibiscus" drink and liked it then you will like this also as the flavor is quite similar. The price is very reasonable, it cost the same as the grocery store including shipping.<br /><br />Definitely will continue to purchase here @ Amazon!

review/text: This is one of my favorite herbal teas for everyday drinking. It's very appley compared to some other brands of apple cinnamon tea, but the apple and cinnamon components are well-balanced with the chamomile to make a flavorful tea.

review/text: I like this tea a lot.  We buy it in bulk.  I have found that you shouldn't leave the bag in the water too long; it acquires and odd taste then.  Otherwise it is flavorful and helps to clear out the phlegm.  Licorice is a natural expectorant.  I also use another product called: "Sanderson's Throat Specific Mixture" to help clear my throat.  It is an amazing product.

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: I decided to be risky and order a big box on unknown tea - this stuff, along with big boxes of Blueberry and Raspberry.  The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting.  Couldn't taste the strawberry.  Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea.  I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.<br /><br />I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up.  When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers.

review/text: I had a hard time finding the tea I had purchased in the past at my local market.  They had stopped carring the flavor of tea I like eventhough they still carried Stash Tea products.  So I went on the internet and was directed to Amazon and found it right away.  Not only that, the pricing was very competitive and I received delivery including freight and handleing cheaper than I could purchase the tea at the market.  By the way Wild Rasberry Hibiscus is a very good flavor if anyone wants to be adventersome and try it.

review/text: I love the taste of this herbal tea, but twice now I noticed I have a rasping (breathing discomfort) that may or may not be triggered by it. I bought 4 boxes after trying a sampler but now I'm starting to think I may have a food sensitivity to one of the licorice spice ingredients. Damn shame, but I wanted to put it out there in case I wasn't the only one.

review/text: My sister suggested this tea to me.  I was looking for a good herbal tea to limit my caffeine, and one I could have in the evening.  Most herbal teas seem very weak to me.  I'm not a big licorice fan, but this doesn't taste strongly of licorice.  As one of the other reviewers said, it just gives you a slightly sweet, slightly licorice aftertaste, which is delightful.  It's great in the evening when I'm craving something sweet - and no calories or caffeine!

review/summary: I'm Wild for this Wild Raspberry Tea
review/text: Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.

review/summary: fav Lemon Ginger tea so far...
review/text: I tried this tea for the first time at a restaurant - 1st time iced - cool & refreshing, 2nd time hot - mmmm. The taste leans more to the ginger side and not the lemon. I have tried other brands such as Yogi and Twinings. I did not like the Yogi brand at all (yuck!), the Twinings' brand while not disgusting taste like lemon tea with a 'hint' of ginger. I have tasted other brands that have a stronger ginger taste than Stash but they've also had a strange taste to them as well so so far Stash is my favorite. This tea is great for upset tummy.

review/text: This is the herbal remedy of choice for those times when I something gross, such as anything from McNasty's or Nasty King. I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water. I like to watch it change color for five minutes, then I sip it and enjoy the sweet relief. The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes.

I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/text: Lower fat granola usually tastes lacking, and are sold generally at organic food stores, which are inconvenient and more costly.  This product tastes great, particularly for a national-brand granola.  You'll have to shop carefully on price, because the current prices I'm seeing on Amazon (4/1/2010) is exceptionally high.  But, if attainable at a good price, it's a great granola.

review/summary: BIG fan for a variety of reasons..(taste, price, health-wise)
review/text: My criteria for a good breakfast cereal:<br /><br />1. Low fat(I usually don't like more than 3 grams of fat per serving)<br />2. Low price (I usually look for cereal on sale for no more than $3 per 15-16 oz box)<br />3. Healthy and filling (not overly sweet or chemically fruity.  Also I like it oak-y (as opposed to flakes" and bulky/chunky. So I gravitate towards granola type cereals. It is a little on the sweet side for my taste, but not over-powering (I removed 1 star for it, but it's more of a personal preference kind of thing. I'm guessing this might not be too sweet for other people).<br /><br />So, this cereal is 4 to 4.5 stars for all criteria.  Although I would like a little dried fruit in it, I definitely am not complaining. It has a great taste and is very filling. Also good to snack on right out of the box.  If you get this on subscribe and save, it's $3/box (and each box is a bulky 1 lb + 3.5 oz  Awesome)!  This cereal normally goes for over $5/ box in NYC when it isn't on sale, so this is a real bargain.

review/summary: Realy good cereal
review/text: I had never tasted this cereal before, but as I buy 5 or more Kellogg's cereals, I thought I would try it...I really like it although I thought it would be sweeter than it is.  I am having it delivered through the Amazon site on a regular basis so it's now an addition to my morning cereal menu.

review/summary: Amazing High Fiber Cereal
review/text: This is NOT cardboard, tasteless high fiber cereal.  It is sweet, crunchy and yummy.  I have gotten a lot of people to try it and they all agree it's really good.  Not the best choice for diabetics but certainly better than many.  It's a little pricey in the grocery store unless there is a super sale and coupons.  The Amazon price is very good.

review/summary: Good value, No Taste
review/text: This Subscribe and Save value is no doubt one of the best for a granola cereal, however, I found the cereal itself to be absolutely tasteless.  Granted, one's expectations for a low fat "anything" are most always often less than for the regular version of that item, but this cereal, unfortunately, just isn't even worth the subscribe and save price.  If you've ever had Nature Valley granola cereal, you'll be very disappointed in this.  I remember Kellog's (I think) having a low fat granola cereal in a yellow box that was quite tasty so it can be done-- unfortunately, not with this product.

review/summary: Terrible chalky, chemical taste - plenty of preservatives.
review/text: I love eating granola. I ran out of cereal late at night so the only thing I could find from my nearby CVS was this Special K Granola. I've tried all sorts of brands of granola before, including Cascadian Farm, Quaker, Ralphs brand, Kashi, Nature's Path, and others. Let me be completely honest. This Special K stuff is the worst. It doesn't taste natural at all. It tastes like synthetic chalky clumps of cereal byproduct.<br /><br />I would take a look at Cascadian Farm granola cereals. I usually buy it from Target or my local grocery stores. They have plenty of flavors of granola cereal - French Vanilla Almond, Cinnamon Raisin, Dark Chocolate Almond, Fruit & Nut, Maple Brown Sugar, Oats & Honey. The best part is, you won't feel like eating it will give you a stomach ulcer like this Special Krap.

review/summary: Get them locally
review/text: This is a collection of 6 "hot" sauces that only cost about $1-$2 individually.  After adding shipping, you're paying at least 50% extra.  You can get 4 of these at Food Lion: Cholula, Bufalo, Tapatio, & ElYucateco.  All of these are mild, ElYucateco is a little hotter than a jalapeno, the rest are weaker.<br /><br />Skip Bufalo all together.  I've found 2 varieties, both were bland, and you might as well just pick up some MILD Tostitos or store brand salsa.<br /><br />Cholula, Tapatio, & ElYucateco are worth trying, but don't waste you're money here, unless you really can't find them in a grocery store.  Be sure to look around, my local store has all of these in their Mexican section, however they also have other hot sauces in Condiments, Asian, & Produce.<br /><br />Also, this set should most certainly NOT be given to a real hot sauce lover, they'll have very likely already tried them.

review/summary: From a 3 to a 5
review/text: I tried to delete my original review of a 3, but for some reason can't, so I'm writing this new one.  My reason for originally giving this product a 3 was that it was a gift and I had expected the bottles to be in some kind of box.  Now, I understand that was MY mistake, and that the photo doesn't imply there's a box, but human error happens.  So why the star upgrade now?  I've since received an email from MexGrocer asking if I would like a box, because they would be happy to send me one.  I'm so flattered that not only would a vendor read my review, but that they would be willing to remedy MY error!!  In short, I haven't tasted the sauces yet, but can say without hesitation that the customer service from this vendor is TOPS!!

review/text: I purchased this product for a Hot Sauce lover for Christmas and it went very well.  There are a couple products here that I could get at a local grocer (I live in the midwest) but there were a few items that neither of us had seen or heard of before and he was anxious to try them.  Maybe a Mexican grocer carries all of these  but for the price and ease of use through amazon, this was a great buy.

review/summary: Not really a gift pack.
review/text: I purchased this "gift pack" for my cousin as a Christmas gift. He loves hot sauces and I thought this would be the perfect "usable" gift. While he was very happy with the sauces (before even tasting them), I was disappointed at the fact that this item was listed as a "gift pack." When I think of a "gift pack" I think of something that is nicely boxed or packaged. What I received was a shipping box with 6 bottles of hot sauce, each individually wrapped in packing paper to avoid damage during shipping. They're fine - don't get me wrong - but not very presentable as a "gift."

What used to be called the "Old World Italian" flavor, which came with a bread crumb topping, has been replaced with a creamy alfredo cheese sauce (with no crumb topping option). The picture which appears above is the older version; however, if you purchase this item, you will receive the new, updated "formula". I made the mistake of purchasing this thinking it was the old kind and it wasn't. (As a side note, you can't typically return grocery items!)

review/text: These biscuits satisfy an urge for a sweet treat without going overboard. I ordered this case of tea biscuits (or cookies) because my local grocery store stopped selling them, after I got hooked on them. They taste great dipped in hot tea, which makes them a mainstay of my tea-drinking ritual. I've tried Kedem's other flavours of tea biscuits -- plain, orange and chocolate -- and prefer the flavour of the vanilla biscuits, which is somewhat like a vanilla wafer (with a smoother texture).  Two biscuits has 32 calories and provide 1.6 gm sugar, a little fat (1% of daily values), a little protein and a little fiber. My spouse likes them with honey or peanut butter spread on them; I like them as they are. Enjoy!

review/summary: Miracle diet
review/text: I have a cat named pounder who is just turning a year old this month. I also have Dallas, her sister. I got both cats when the were about 10 weeks old so they were very small. When they turned about 8 months old, pounder started to vomit. And she would vomit about twice a week. I took her to the vet and parasite exams, bloodwork and X-rays showed that she was a normal cat. The next step was sedation followed by endoscopy to take biopsy of her stomach and small intestine. That bill would have been around 1200$ and I just don't have that kind of money. So my vet suggested trying a hypoallergenic diet first. She has been on the diet for three weeks now and only thrown up once when she first started the diet. She is also gaining weight and her fur looks so much better. I know it's expensive but if your staring at a large vet bill with the outcome that you will still have to buy the food, just try this first. I am a highly satisfied client.

I was able to repair one of the ladybugs but the other was unable to be repaired. I wish that the colors were brighter. They are a bit dull. Overall, they worked fine for what I needed.

review/summary: Perfect on cupcakes!
review/text: I've always wanted to do a ladybug themed birthday and was so excited that my soon-to-be 4 year old asked for one! I found these edible ladybug decorations that were the perfect size for cupcakes. Green "grass" frosting and one little ladybug on each cupcake = adorable! The kids said they taste yummy, too!<br /><br />My original order was incorrect, so the company immediately remedied the problem and sent the correct amount out the same day. I really appreciated the quick response and great customer service!

review/summary: Soooo cute
review/text: I got this item for my sister's baby shower.  They are soooo cute and looked great on the cupcakes.  What the best part was how the company shipped them, they put them in a nice plastic container with foam around them.  I was worried before I got them that would be broken but how this company packs them was awesome!!!!  Even when they go through the mail.

review/summary: Best Kibble on the Market
review/text: This food is baked at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes (you can find this information on Life4K9's website).  Most dog foods on the market are extruded (flash cooked) at temperatures of over 1000 degrees.  It has been proven that the higher a temperature you cook food at, the more nutrient loss there is within the food (do some Google searches if you were unaware of this fact).  There are a few other companies out there that sell baked dog food, but none of them (that I have been able to find) will tell you at what temperature they cook their food.  Life4K9 is up-front about what temperature they cook their food at, and I like that.<br /><br />For the record, I do not work for Life4K9, nor have any affiliation with their company.  I have just been searching for a long time for the right food for my dogs.  I think a raw food diet is probably best, but I have two labs, and it is too expensive and time consuming for me to feed them a well-balanced raw food diet.  So, in my search for the next best thing, I finally found Life4K9 and have been very pleased with the quality of their food so far (as have my dogs).
