review/summary: Good aftertaste
review/text: Sugar replacements generally have some kind of aftertaste, whether they be natural or brewed up in some chem lab.  Stevia is no exception, especially if you over apply.  But this Stevia has the least of any I've tried, and I've tried several.  I have this on Amazon's "subscription" service, so I guess I like it  :)

review/summary: Thank you SweetLeaf!
review/text: We used to use Sweet-N-Low in our iced tea, coffee, etc.  I have become much more of a 'naturalist' so I starting using stevia.  I LOVE SweetLeaf!  The liquid is awesome.  Easy to use, mixes very easily into anything.  The very best part is that my EXTREMELY picky 10 year old likes it too!  The powder packets work well for purses and travel.  I like the ease of the liquid, so I now use the SweetLeaf travel size bottle. Don't expect it to taste like refined sugar, because it is not sugar.  It has a nice sweet taste.

review/summary: It doesn't taste very good.
review/text: SweetLeaf SteviaClear liquid does not taste good at all.  I purchased this to make cookies for my brother's girlfriend Mary who has a medical condition that doesn't allow for her to consume sugar or carbohydrates.  She uses a lot of Splenda, but Splenda can cause an array of problems (formaldehyde on the brain for example).  I thought Stevia would be a good alternative to try.  I wasn't expecting to like it myself because I don't like sugar substitutes such as Splenda or aspartame, but I thought at least Mary would like it.  I thought wrong.  This product has a nasty bitter aftertaste that tastes very similar to fingernail polish remover.  It's horrible.  Mary did not like it nor did anyone in my family.  I tried the Stevia in cookies, tea, and coffee, but nothing was able to mask the nasty aftertaste.  I would recommend steering away from this product and so would Mary.

review/summary: Stevia Liquid
review/text: I do not like wasting calories on sweetening tea, and I drink a lot, so I have been using Splenda and Sweet 'N Low for years.  However, Splenda seems to interfere with my weight loss and I also wonder about the long-term health consequences.<br /><br />My first attempt at using stevia was Sun Crystals, which is half sugar and half stevia.  You could consider it a gateway drug to going natural.  It helped me overcome the bitter aftertaste, which is no longer an issue.  In fact, I prefer stevia over Splenda now!<br /><br />There are many forms of stevia, but I like liquid because it has no filler and mixes easily.  It also goes a long way.  SweetLeaf in particular has a very pure taste and the dropper bottle is great for dosing drinks by the preferred amount.  For baking, which Splenda handles like a pro, I have found Sweetleaf lacking.  The baking process seems to erase the sweetness, even though it holds up to hot tea.  It is also important to use Sweetleaf only in applications where it can be mixed in completely.  As with liquid artificial sweetener, it is very bitter before dilution.<br /><br />SweetLeaf is a pretty perfect way to sweeten drinks, even though it does not work for baking.  If you are brave enough to go through the initial period of "breaking in" to stevia flavor, I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Good, portable natural sugar-free sweetner
review/text: If you like to sweeten coffee or drinks, and prefer not to use aspartame (which breaks down into fun things like formaldehyde at 80 degrees), saccharine (which can be used to polish chrome) or sucralose (sugar mixed with chlorine), stevia is an excellent alternative.<br /><br />This contains a lot of stevia sweetener, mixed with water.  In my experience, the bottle lasts about 2 months.  I add two droppers worth to my coffee (I like it extremely sweet).<br /><br />Keep in mind some people don't like stevia because it does have an aftertaste, so I'd say try a smaller bottle, or even purchase stevia-based sweeteners in the supermarket, to see if that works well for you, before you purchase 2 big bottles of the sweetener.<br /><br />The bottles themselves hold a lot of the sweetener, and provide a nice eye dropper with which to extract them.  However, because the bottle contains over 3 oz of liquid, be sure to pack the liquid in your checked baggage if you travel with it.<br /><br />If you make a lot of smoothies or drink a lot of tea or coffee, like the idea of a natural sweetener, and like the taste of stevia, this is a good value because it mixes well with hot or iced drinks as it's in a liquid.

review/summary: Best Sugar Substitute...Best Stevia!
review/text: I tried this after trying the powdered stevia, both SweetLeaf and other brands.  I like this a lot better than the powder--it mixes into (cold) liquids much better.  Sometimes the powdered stevia does not mix into liquids as well, or in packets the powder is hardened and those clumps don't dissolve easily or at all into cold drinks.<br />  I really only use this in iced tea, which I drink a lot of.  I use 10 drops in a 30-ounce glass.  There is no aftertaste.  Replacing iced tea with lemon and sweetened with stevia has really saved a lot of money instead of drinking diet sodas, not to mention it's much healthier!<br />  I will only use Stevia, which is a natural sugar substitute any more.  Splenda, which is supposed to be "made from sugar" is not really natural, and I've read reports which say that it produces formaldehyde (!!!???) in the brain....does not sound healthy!!  I have also read reports about the adverse effects of NutraSweet.<br />  I notice no aftertaste with Stevia--if you do, you may be using too much, or maybe you're just not used to it yet...anymore, on the rare occasion I do have a diet soda, I notice an aftertaste with THAT...too bad they don't make diet sodas with Stevia!<br />  Also, the SweetLeaf brand is best in taste and quality, and the price here on amazon is better than anywhere I have seen.

review/summary: The only brand of stevia I use
review/text: In my estimation as an regular user of stevia, SteviaClear by SweetLeaf is the best product available.  I use it in coffee and tea, and in smoothies and protein shakes if a little extra sweetness is required.  I've not cooked or baked using SteviaClear.  There is no bitter aftertaste with SteviaClear even if I sample just a small drop on the end of my finger.  There are no additives in SteviaClear except for grapefruit seed extract.  Be cautious of brands of stevia that use added chemical flavorings or alcohol for extraction.  SteviaClear is a great alternative for anyone using artificial sweeteners or anyone wanting to cut-back or eliminate sugar, honey, agave, etc from their diets.  Try SteviaClear.  You won't be disappointed.  Also, check the website at [...] for more information.

review/summary: Bitter Bitter, There Are Better Stevias Out There!
review/text: This was the first liquid stevia I tried. I didn't have anything to compare it to (other than Truvia packets, which I noted were not bitter). I thought it was ok, but definitely had a bitter aftertaste. It is great for sweetening beverages such as lemonade, etc, that already have a sour flavor. However, do not bake with it! I followed erithritol/liquid stevia combination recipes using SweetLeaf and my goods came out just awful. These bottles now mostly just sit on my shelf as a waste. On a recent recommendation, I ordered a bottle of NuNaturals liquid stevia. There's a HUGE difference with the NuNaturals having basically no bitter aftertaste. It's a little more expensive, but invest in something you'll actually use and enjoy!

review/summary: Keeps You Safe From Sugar
review/text: I view sugar as the enemy and try to dodge the sugar bullet at all times.  I always check the sugar content on everything I buy and rest assured, I never, repeat, NEVER buy sugar.  That's where stevia comes in.<br /><br />This little Godsend in a bottle is excellent in tea and anything you want to bake.  For those of you who enjoy sweets, just use this instead of sugar if you are baking from scratch.  Box mixes don't count - they're LOADED with sugar.  Stevia in a bottle comes with a little eye dropper that makes it easy for you to regulate the amount of stevia you want to use.  You use a fraction of the amount of stevia that you would have used had you gone with sugar.  I consider stevia your passport to enjoying something sweet and something safe and natural.

My family of 4 goes through a lot of sweet tea.  We wanted to cut our sugar consumption so I tried stevia.  We usually sweeten the whole pitcher. The dropper makes it easy to measure.  We tried other brands of liquid stevia at first and were not happy.  Sweet Leaf has been constistant in concentration and has never clouded the tea.  It also doesn't have the alcohol taste that some of the other brands had.  We haven't purchased any other brand for years.

It has a horribly bitter taste if it's not diluted quite a bit-- for example, I tried to put a few drops on some sliced strawberries but had to just throw them away.  Yech.  But I use it every day, about 10 drops in a 24 oz bottle of water with some lemon slices and it's been great.

review/summary: The best Stevia we have found!
review/text: And the best price!!  My husband and I have been using Stevia to sweeten coffee and tea for the past 4-5 years.  SweetLeaf SteviaClear is the best tasting Stevia product we have found.  We've tried several brands of both the liquid and the powder.  I plan to stick with SweetLeaf permanently.  I hope the price on Amazon remains this nice.  :)<br /><br />If you are new to Stevia, keep an open mind while you get used to the flavor.  While it does sweeten just as well as sugar, it doesn't taste like sugar.  Don't expect to not be able to tell the difference.  But if you keep an open mind to a new flavor, I think you'll quickly fall in love with this calorie-free sweetener!!

review/summary: Best Brand of Stevia
review/text: Sweetleaf is the only brand of Stevia I will buy anymore. I love the flavored ones, but use this unflavored liquid with foods that already have enough flavor on their own. As with any Stevia, if you use too much it will be bitter. I use 3 drops for a 12 oz. cup of tea and 1/2 dropper for 6 servings of steel cut oats. I wish there was a version that would take the place of sugar in baked goods. In using liquid or powder I've found that you can only substitute 1/2 the sugar, or the baked good won't turn out right. Love this product!

review/text: Sweetleaf is the only stevia I use anymore and you can't beat the price when you get it on autoship.  The "brand name" stevia products are mixed with other things I don't want (one brand has more sugar than stevia in the product, but they still market it as stevia!)  I use Sweetleaf stevia for everything: coffee, lemonade, cooking, yogurt (makes plain yogurt taste like vanilla) - Just use a little at a time and be careful to not use too much or you will start to get the "off" taste so many people complain about.

review/summary: Expensive, Used To Quickly
review/text: I normally use the diluted stevia from trader joes which I love but I thought using two level teaspoons for my coffee was quite a bit and with all the coffee and teas I drink working from home the bottle would only last me 3 weeks. I saw the reviews for this stuff on Amazon and thought I'd give it a try. People were saying a few drops well it is more like a few dropper fulls. To give you an idea about my level of sweetness, if I were a Starbucks fan which I'm not I would like something around a mocha. To make my coffee in the morning with this stuff and chocolate soymilk I need to use 5 full dropper-fulls not 5 drops to sweeten it. Needless to say the bottle doesn't last any longer than my Trader Joes powder and one bottle of SweetLeaf is twice the price. On top of all that the diluted Trader Joes powder doesn't have any aftertaste whatsoever. Even in mild teas it only sweetens and doesn't change the taste. This SweetLeaf stevia does change the taste not necessarily bad but noticeable with the amount I use and I'd rather just taste my drink.

review/summary: Sweetleaf Liquid Stevia changed something about 6 mos ago?
review/text: My wife and I have been purchasing and using Sweetleaf liquid Stevia for approx 3 years (auto-purchase the 2-pack, 4 oz bottles, monthly).  Until recently, it was marketed in brown bottles and the liquid was crystal clear.  About 6 mos ago the packaging changed to green bottles and from the very first shipment, there was a white suspension and white mucus around inside of cap and rim of the bottle.  That said, we still use it; have not noticed any change in concentration (still use 5 to 6 drops equivalency to 1 teaspoon of sugar).  It has not been watered down and we have not seen black suspension or mold as other reviewers have indicated.  And, we've not noticed any symptoms one might expect if the congealed substance was anything toxic.  Our guess is that some of the stevia extract is congealing due to a manufacturing process change.  Hopefully, Wisdom Natural Brands, the manufacturer, will rectify this and return it to it's crystal clear liquid.  Until then, we're still using the liquid, ignoring the suspension and enjoying the 'sweet' life.  If you really can't handle the current product, check out NOW brands stevia.  It's priced about the same and, while we haven't tried it recently, it's probably still crystal clear.  Hope this helps.

review/summary: Dogs LOVE Filling,...Only
review/text: My three dogs go crazy over any Dingo product. However, they are expensive compared to other dog treats and after our dogs have chewed out the meat filling, they leave the rawhide cover on the floor and beg for another Dingo even though they haven't finished the first one. Pig Ears seem to be a better value for the money because the dogs eat the entire treat and end up spending more time exercising their teeth. I'll save the Dingos for very special occasions.

In fact, she won't finish eating any other brand of rawhide treats we've bought her.

They charge shipping, but if you stock up and buy 8 bags as an example, the shipping is only nine bucks.  Also, online coupons are frequently available for their website.

review/summary: Too much RED DYE!!
review/text: I didn't wanted to buy anything that was made with rawhide but a friend gave my pup a Dingo and he loved it. So I forced myself and brought my first bag of Dingo Dental Bones a month ago. Stitch loved it! I loved it too because he actually spent a good 45 minutes~2 hours on a Dingo Dental Bone. I didn't really like the red dye in the chicken meat but it wasn't overwhelming. If you actually crack a piece of the chicken off you can still see some non-dyed chicken.<br /><br />So I ordered a second bag of Dingo, just the original red package. The red dye was so strong that the whole piece of chicken was blood red and it even DYED the rawhide pinkish red!! It's kind of ridiculous to dye something the dog can smell! It's not necessary as long it tastes delicious.<br /><br />Anyhow I am on the search for something else, hopefully a better alternative other than Dingos.<br /><br />At least it wasn't made in China.

review/summary: Cheap Chinese-made products are dangerous to pets
review/text: I've stopped buying Dingo products when I noticed that they were being made in China.  I was on their website, and they answered one of the posters that was concerned about it, essentially stating that they test the products rigorously and go through strict quality control.  That's a bunch of CRAP !! They started making them in China to SAVE MONEY, they are not about to SPEND those savings on testing and quality control. What they do is GAMBLE that the products will be okay, and if they aren't they just RECALL them, write off the loss, and it's just too bad for the poor little pets that end up with life threatening illnesses.  Our government doesn't do anything about it, because our government is OWNED by Corporations, far be it for them to interfere with the Almighty Multi-National Corporations.<br />  I'm not taking ANY chances with MY dogs, I care for them way too much, to buy something that was processed in some factory in China that processes everything under the sun, from car batteries, to baby food. If there's some cross-contamination going on, it probably won't be discovered until it's already too late for SOME pets.

review/summary: My puppy tires of these...and they can be VERY dangerous!
review/text: My puppy loves to chew, so I got these.  She likes them until the meat entwined in them is gone, then she goes to something else.  Plus they can be VERY dangerous.  I saw her chewing on something one day and went to look.  She had found one of these she'd left where I didn't see it and had chewed it to where the end was gooey and mushy.  I've read that if they swallow this part, it can get caught in their intestines and block them OR in their throat and choke them.  I threw them away after reading that and reading sad stories of others who had to take their dog to the vet, expensive surgeries and such.  I'll never buy them or anything like them again.  I don't get anything for her that is rawhide, can splinter, etc.  The best thing I've found for her to chew on that is edible and safe is called "Beefeaters Sweet Potato Snacks For Dogs".  Do a search here on amazon.com or on Google and you can find them from $8.99 and up, but they're worth it to have something safe for your dog to chew on.  They are all natural, satisfies her need to chew, is full of vitamins and most importantly, SAFE for her.  They come in a huge bag, so for my little 6 pounder, they last a long time.  Sometimes I even cut one in half and give it to her.  The slices are pretty big, so they'd be very good for big dogs too.  Stay clear of ANYTHING rawhide or like that if you love your four-legged baby.

review/text: My 5 month old french bulldog puppy almost died on the first bone tonight.  He chewed it down and attempted to swallow a piece that was too big to go down his throat.  When he began gagging and throwing up I had to stick my hand down his throat to push the lodged bone into his stomach.  VERY scary and upset me greatly.  I do NOT recommend these bones.  There is even a choking warning on the back in small writing.  Keep your pet safe and purchase MUCH BIGGER bones for them, and take away anything too small so they cannot choke or get hurt.

review/summary: Missy's "Must Have"!!
review/text: When I got my dachshund from the Humane Society, she was overweight and had bad tartar on her teeth.  The vet said she'd need to be seen in a few weeks to have the tartar removed.  Instead, she was given a Dingo Bone every evening, which she chewed up.  Her teeth are nice and clean now.<br /><br />Missy was also placed on a low calorie food and no longer receives "people food". She gets her daily Dingo Bone right after her evening meal and she wants it IMMEDIATELY!  Doxies can get quite bouncy when they really want something.<br /><br />I really appreciate the large value package which is not offered in any store, and the price, plus the ease and fast shipping when I purchase through Amazon.

I don't know what it is about these things, but they bring out the crazy in my dogs.

I've had no issues with this product except that from time to time it gets stuck inbetween their teeth or they try to swallow it whole when it's almost gone, but that can happen with any raw hide. I'm only giving it a 4 star because it does not prevent tartar build up for my dogs.

review/summary: Good value mini rawhide bones - 40 lb Labrador pup enjoys them
review/text: After finishing a whole pack of 21 bones, our Labrador pup loved these bones with meat in the middle. A tasty treat indeed. The bones are wrapped properly and it keeps  both our puppy and us satisfied.<br /><br />In response to some glaring negative reviews, just be aware that anything your dog eats is a hazard. If those aforementioned bad experiences were true, I'm truly sorry. Take care of your dogs the best you can. Regardless, the rawhide is still a potential risk. However, the reviews referring to the bad quality due to the Chinese production is completely fraudulent. Just because it's made in China does NOT mean the product is made poorly.  It is simply a unsupported attack towards this company. I've also seen the almost exact "Anti-Chinese" review for Pork chomps rawhide bones.<br /><br />Some other thoughts:<br />* The meat in the middle can be a little jagged sharp sometimes. Just check it before feeding your dog.<br />* Great value for the 21 pack<br />* Our Labrador pup loves them<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with these rawhide bones with meat in the middle. If our puppy could say it, she would agree with me too.

review/summary: Our dogs love these
review/text: We have 2 dogs, one is 8lbs and the other 12lbs and both of them love these.  One bone keeps them busy for about 30mins.  They are fairly small so if your dog is any larger than 15lbs you will probably want to get the next size up.  Even our 12lb dog could handle something bigger but we buy one size out of convenience.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend these but I suggest that you watch the price, as it seems to fluctuate a lot.  I bought two bags for the price that one is currently listed for!

review/text: If you have a dog or puppy that chews on everything and/or has a ton of frenetic energy, Dingo bones are great.  Some dogs need 'a job' to do to keep them out of trouble.  Each bone lasts my small terrier mix around 2 hours.  I enjoy, that unlike many dog treats, there is no odor or mess associated with Dingo Bones.  I wish that these were available for Subscribe and Save so I could get an automatic monthly delivery!

review/summary: Loved by one picky-picky dog!
review/text: My dog is super picky about her treats (probably because she is hopelessly spoiled).  Why have a dog crunchie when you can have "people food"?  So finding a good chewy treat that helps her teeth and keeps her happy has been somewhat challenging.  She ADORES Dingo mini bones! They are the perfect size for her (she's a 9lb Chinese Crested) and she will spend an hour just chomping away at these bones.  So happy to have found something she likes!

review/text: If you have a small dog as I have two then this is the deal for you. Yes my dogs chew the meat out first.  But they finish the rawhide too.  They also play fetch with these bones.  They are expensive but if you put them side by side to the Dollar Store ones there's more meat in them. They also sell some with double meat these are a wonderful product and they are worth the money.

review/text: My Jack Russells love these little bones.  They will chew on them until their gone rather than hide them or bury them for later.  I do have trouble with one dog eating them much faster than the other so then they get in a game of steal the bone, but hey, that just wears them out faster.  When I bought this, it was $12.99 which wasn't much of a "value" compared to the price at Kroger.  But I think they are now $9.99 which is like getting one 7-pack for free.

review/text: DANGEROUS BONES!!! Little dogs love these bones because they are tasty BUT they are truly dangerous. Our family Maltese (Pebbles) who had just turned one choked to death on one. They are not even safe if your supervising your dog because our dog choked on one in the presence of my sister. We were unable to do anything for her as we watched in horror as she slowly stopped breathing and got her to the vet in less than ten minutes. The vet attempted an emergency procedure and removed two peices and the bone had also tore her trachea. Her death was caused by these bones. These bones are not worth your precious pets life as it tore our family apart.

review/text: I was skeptical to give my yorkie rawhides but my vet said it would be okay.  These were the only treats that would keep him entertained since he doesn't care much for toys and they were very easy to find.  Unfortunately my dog seemed to swallow a large piece of the mini dingo rawhides yesterday.  At 2 am I heard my dog let out a loud howl that I have never heard before, I went to check on him and found him gagging and obviously trying to throw something up.  Right as I was about to take him to the animal hospital he threw up the rawhide and he's all better now.  I'm NEVER giving him a rawhide treat, they swell in the dog's stomach and can kill them.  I rather not take that risk with my dog.
