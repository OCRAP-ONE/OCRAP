review/summary: Very Tasty!
review/text: Very tasty.<br /><br />It's hard to find something which has as much protein (6g) as sugars (6g).  I just wish that the sugars were really sugar instead of corn syrup; also, it would taste even better (in my opinion) if it had 2/3 as much sugar.  but still the best snack bar out there.

review/summary: Delicious but super hard on the teeth
review/text: If you like peanut brittle then you'll like this.  Really nutty and brittle-like in the crunch.  I didn't expect it to be so brittle and had a hard time eating.  Was too salty for me but I liked the content of nuts and the delicious flavor so I may repurchase in the future.

review/summary: Tasty snack, full of energy, low carb.
review/text: These are good, but beware. It's roasted nuts, so it's about 60% fat. That's good for active people, and would be awesome as trail food, sports snacks, or for my kids, but for those of us who sit on our duffs all day, these don't meet our dietary needs.<br /><br />Even so, these are very tasty. They're not too sweet, and not too salty.  This is the Almond Crunch which has better flavor variety, but the Peanut Crunch is OK too.  Both have peanuts. Both are the same amount of protein, fat and sugar.

review/summary: Finally a truly gluten free bar from Nature Valley
review/text: These bars are very different from the other non gluten-free Nature Valley granola bars so it's important to set the proper expectations. It's hard to describe, but essentially these bars are just nuts bound together with some sort of sugary honey binding. As you can imagine it makes these bars extremely crunchy and somewhat hard on your teeth unless you break them apart in your hand first. Once you get past this challenge you'll find the bar to be delicious and very filling since it's basically just nuts. The nutrition info can be a little misleading because all of the calories/fat come directly from the nuts which isn't a bad thing. These are definitely worth trying out and we're finding that they are in more and more supermarkets these days.

review/text: There aren't many crunchy breakfast bars out there that aren't also super crumbly. I love these. I have one pretty much every morning when I'm driving to work. They have pretty good protein and fairly low calories. The only thing I don't like is the fact that there just isn't any variety. They just make Almond and Peanut flavors. I really wish there was a Cashew variety.

review/summary: Soooo delicious
review/text: A friend gave me one of these bars to try, and I am hooked.  I thought they would be like other granola bars, but as another reviewer says, they are almost like a nut brittle.  I buy the almond variety, which is almost entirely nuts, sunflower seeds, and a sweetener to hold it all together.  They are sweet and nutty, just like nut brittle.  The taste is amazing, but there are only 6 grams of sugar in the bar!  That's what keeps me going back... they're not completely healthy, but they're not as bad a candy, either.  They are a great protein-filled snack with a dessert-like flavor.  I like granola bars well enough, but I don't look forward to eating them.  But I actually look forward to one of these as an evening snack with a cup of tea.

On the other hand, Amazon apologized for the mistake and sent me six boxes in addition to the one I'd received.

They are a fantastic snack.<br /><br />However, the value just isn't there.  In warehouse shopping clubs, you can buy other Nature Valley bars of the same quality for about 1/3rd of the price and get 30 bars in a case lot box, rather than 6 small retail boxes.  At today's price, these bars are about $0.56 each vs $0.27 from a warehouse club.

review/summary: Illy Espresso
review/text: Trying Illy espresso for the first time I was really looking forward to it, primarily because of all the publicity the company gets.  After following the directions in my new espresso maker I pulled the shots and came away disappointed.  This is very average espresso.<br /><br />I've been drinking espresso for 20 years and making it at home for the last 6.  The crema was below average (very thin) as was the flavor (especially when I paid $11.95 plus shipping for an 8.8 ounce container).  I have since pulled other shots with the same result:  flavor was not robust and very, very average.

review/summary: Illy
review/text: I just spent a month in Italy and got hooked on Illy brewed in a standard drip filter coffee maker. I used 6-7 coffee spoons for a 10-cup pot. Once I got the right ratio, I found the coffee full-bodied and sweet without acidity. I am glad I brought a couple of cans back from Italian grocery stores; it costs double here. Keep in mind that it is canned coffee, so don't expect it to be as robust as fresh roasted from your local coffee shop. But, if you like to experiment with different coffees, give it a try. It is packaged in a nicely designed can with a screw-on top that seals pretty well.

review/text: These hard candies have a terrible non-taste.  There is a goo in the center that tastes like plain corn syrup only not sweet;  there is absolutely no liquor flavor to this product.  It resembles a stale cough drop at best....no kick, no zing,  no sweetness.  Yuck.  I will never buy this item again.  ( I checked the expiration and these don't expire until 2015 and if that's the best/freshness you achieve then forget this food item ) This is why this candy is just about 2 dollars a bag;  you pay for what you get. 2 thumbs down; save your money on another brand after dinner liquor candy.

Unfortunately the standard put-up is 12 cans in a half-carton -- a cardboard box bottom and a flexible plastic film top, which apparently is a cost-cutting measure. The cans bang into each other during shipping, because the plastic film top is the equivalent of putting them in a bag.<br /><br />The cans arrive severely dented, which could compromise the seal, and allow baterial contamination.

Although grown from a tiny little seed that the sun and rain helps in growth it is our heavenly father our creator God who truly makes them grow and should be appreciated for his gift of life to us all and for our home the planet we call earth .<br />I used to be a true vegetarian then I went to only eating Poultry and some fish and eggs through out the years.Now I will eat vegetarian soup made with some beef stock but I don't care for the meat itself and no pork.<br />I am still Organic Alternative and Green but I am slowly trying to go back to being that true vegetarian that I used to be however going raw will take a some time because I have a little hard time chewing with my teeth like my friend but after I get my dentures I will be able to adjust into it .Right now I am canning for winter storage.I have dehydrated my whole garden into green super power food that I added to my barley greens. note if you choose to cook get the Fagor Pressure cooker caner That I got it helps make the meals go quicker and is a lot healthier than baking and Broiling or grilling and never fry food.<br />Well I will let you know how the canning turn out and one day I'd like to make home made all fruit yes that's right not jelly or jam.<br />Hi Again so far so good I have canned 4 pint jars of my home made spaghetti sauce with 4 of Chili and 4 vegetarian soups with 2 red cabbages and they sealed and are ready for winter when things get rough as around here it is hard to get organics so when I do I get all that I can like I just got up at the farmers market this late fall and then I either freeze them or can them and even dehydrate them.<br />So I will keep you up to date but I need to try and get some organic fruits and that is hard to get again around here.<br />well catch ya later as I never say goodbye!Just get this wonderful organic fruit nut and seed mix it has no preservatives and is delicious and affordable and if I can get it you can too. Just remember to soak the nuts and seeds because nature puts some  protective coating on it and they need to break down this to be edible and fit for human consumption.

review/summary: blue 1 food coloring = severe abdominal agony
review/text: I *cheer* the fact these pickle relish packages contain turmeric spice which is a super powerful anti-inflammatory (strong enough that my husband used turmeric capsules over pain meds when he had surgery for a hip fracture a couple years ago..)<br /><br />However... these pickle relish packets contain BLUE 1!  FD&C BLUE 1 causes severe abdominal distress in a percentage of the population (many of whom have yet to make the connection).  If you aren't sure why Blue 1 is such a bad idea, check out the FDA press release stating blue 1 is "casually linked" to fatalities they investigated.<br /><br />I recently attended an event where these relish packets were served. Stoopidly I dumped the packet onto my food and a few hours later, like clockwork, I was in severe abdominal distress. Major GI issues. Checking around, sure enough, these packets show blue 1 in the ingredients.  Just 1 packet had me doubled over in pain.. and worse.<br /><br />Parents: if you aren't sure why your kids randomly seem to develop stomach aches, diarrhea, abdominal distress, bloating, cramping or worse - bloody stools, start reading the food labels of everything consumed 24-36 hours prior to onset. A pattern will undoubtedly emerge...

review/summary: A Crispy Pastry Disk. Light Taste And Slightly Sweet.
review/text: My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market stocks a lot of exotic and interesting gourmet products. I enjoy trying them out. Today, there were several large boxes of Ines Rosales Sweet Olive Oil Tortas imported from Seville, Spain. So what is this? Well, I had no idea, but they looked good. So, I bought a pack of 6.3 ounces and it contained six tortas. Well, they're like a five-inch diameter thin crispy pastry disk that is somewhat like a pie crust. It's fragile and quite easily broken. The flavor is light and slightly sweet. The instructions suggest to serve them with cheese, perhaps also with coffee or tea. I had one with my evening salad meal. One of the tortas is listed as 14o calories and half of that is fat, presmably olive oil. So, now I know what tortas are. They're  a tasty item, but I doubt I'd buy a second pack.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Closer to 3 and a half stars, but I'll be fair and round up
review/text: I fairly recently got a package of various products from Omaha steaks as a birthday gift from a friend.  Included was a couple boxes of these prime rib slices.  I won't call them wonderful, there's no substitute for a prime rib sliced off of a freshly cooked roast in a well run steakhouse.  But for what they are, a precooked steak that's frozen, they aren't bad, and do make a good way to have a last minute entree for unexpected company and/or when one is in a rush and don't have too much time otherwise.<br /><br />I normally don't comment on other reviews in my own, and to be fair I already posted a comment in the one star review's comment section, the one titled "YUCK".  But a few comments here also if I may:  1)  The fellow complains about the lack of au jus.  It's a condiment.  It's like complaining about the lack of grated horseradish (I know people who like prime rib with such) or any other condiment people might eat with prime rib or steak in general not being with this.  Unless a package says that a condiment is included, I don't assume that such would be.  So without trying to belittle the author of "YUCK", I find his complaint to be unwarrented.  If he wishes there to be au jus, there's au jus that one can buy from the spice section of most grocery stores.  Or one can use the juices in the individual packaging for each steak slice and try to make some if one knows how.  2)  Although again I don't think these warrent a five star review, they are hardly flavorless.  Not a strong flavor, but I did detect a bit of a flavor from some rub that was put on the outside before cooking and slicing.  The steaks themselves DID taste like prime rib to me, albeit obviously prime rib that had been frozen.  So I'm not sure what "YUCK" got, but it apparently was different from my prime rib slices.

You can't even tell what kind of meat this is. Also, it does not come with any type of Au jus. Au jus it kinda what makes it prime rib and not a ribeye. There is none. There seem to be no seasoning on it either to make up for the lack of Au jus. If I was out to eat and was served this, I'd send it back to the kitchen in a heartbeat.

review/summary: I agree about the Ginger Snaps switch-out, but...  I won't live without these!
review/text: I agree with the previous reviewer's experience.  My first batch of these "new" pastilles were about half powder, and I'd (at that time) vowed to never purchase them again.  That was easier said than done, though, and after a few months I picked up a couple of tins at my local health food store.  Totally different!  They seem to have completely addressed the issue.  They are larger than the snaps, but they are smooth and compact, now - even shiny on the surface.  This has been without exception for the past two dozen or more tins I've worked my way through.  I don't think I can live without them!<br /><br />The quotes inside the lid aren't nearly as good, however...

review/text: I'd had a bulk bag of St. Claire's Ginger Snaps and really liked them. When I finally ran out, I looked for them again, found these Ginger Sweets and though they were the same thing.  They are not quite the same - they're a lot larger, much softer and very prone to disintegrate into a lot of white dust.  My shipper did a valiant job of packing them, and even so, the dust was EVERYWHERE in the package.  Fortunately it stayed IN the package or I might have had the FBI on my doorstep.  They really aren't suitable for mailing long distances.  I sure wish that St. Claire's would bring back the smaller, harder Ginger Snaps, but oh well.  I won't order this kind again.

review/summary: I sprinkle it over her kibble and she loves it.
review/text: I have been giving my dog the dehydrated dog food as an extra treat to add to her kibble.  I have been looking for something I can add to my dog's food to give her a bit of variation, that won't make her tummy sick.  This was the perfect solution.  You can actually see what is inside and the ingredients are mostly very natural.<br /><br />At first I rehydrated the food with some water and added kibble on top.  This worked out great and it was so much easier than taking wet food out of a can.  I suppose if you aren't too concerned with financial costs, and your dog is doing well on this food, keep going.  But 6 pounds of food for $20.00 is not going to work for me.<br /><br />I realize that the directions say you should add water but the owner of the local pet store that I purchased this from suggested to sprinkle a small amount on top of kibble, just dry.  I did this and my dog liked it.  At one point she would just lick up the dehydrated bits; and slowly eat the kibble.  I mix the dehydrated parts with the kibble now.  This made the dehydrated food last much longer than.  A box lasts a few months now, and my dog enjoys eating her meals.<br /><br />So far I have tried the Herbed Lamb and Beef Zucchini.  My dog seems to like each one equally.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good for sensitive/allergic dogs.<br />2. Can use de/rehydrated.<br />3. Apparently it tastes very good.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The price.<br />2. Does not last very long.

review/summary: finally a food that settled my doggie's tummy, but recent price increase outrageous
review/text: No matter how highly rated of a kibble we would get for our little shih tzu & yorkie mix, she would throw up about three times per week.  Once we switched to this raw dehydrated meal at the recommendation of some folks at a local pet store who have a pomeranian with a sensitive tummy, the problem was solved!  Even if she would get into something she was not supposed to, no vomiting, seemed to do miracles for her digestive track in general, so was very pleased!  Have also used the chicken formula, which we have had a great experience with, as well.  Also - she LOVES it!  To save money, we would buy the large 8 pound bag and I am very sad that the price has recently risen so drastically (Nov. of 2011 from $60 per bag to $75, BIG jump).  Because of the price increase, we had switched to Grandma Lucy's (Artisan freeze-dried), with equal success as far as no vomiting and her loving the food, but have switched back to Addiction because she was looking thin, as if the protein content was not enough.  I would recommend calling around to specialty feed stores in your area to find the absolute best price.

review/summary: Good for allergies, terrible for hairballs
review/text: While I prefer wet food for my cats, one of them will only eat dry food. And he has a food allergy that causes flaky, itchy skin and a dull coat. I wanted to try this as the Felidae canned food is high quality and this food is supposed to be good for cats with allergies or sensitive stomachs.<br /><br />We've been feeding this to our two cats and our foster kittens for a couple weeks now and please explain to me why my 7 year old cats suddenly have terrible hairballs. Every day they dry cough and choke, especially my cat with allergies who will only eat the dry food and therefore consumes the most. Even the 10-week old kittens who are short-haired are coughing a little bit. My adult cats are vomiting hairballs now too. Not only is this alarming, but it necessitates the need for a hairball remedy. I should also include that IAMS indoor hairball dry food is what I was feeding when my cat showed symptoms of allergies to food. I am not even sure I will get through the rest of the bag, I might just throw it out. I don't wish all that coughing on strays, shelter cats, or rats.<br /><br />The reason I gave two stars -- this food has helped with my cat's allergies. His coat is shinier and his skin is not flaky. But in our case, these benefits are far outweighed by the suspiciously new and sudden coughing/hacking/vomiting.

I reluctantly shared it with four others who were really taken back about how good the fudge was so it's not just me - it was a hit all the way around :).<br />One thing to note is the fudge ( I bought 1/2lb of each) came in a lovely decorative box totally suitable for gift giving so you could purchase and have it sent directly as a gift knowing that it will be arrive wrapped nicely and professionally.<br />In my reviews I like to include the "cons" but there simply are none for Mo's Fudge - I will never buy any other fudge again and doubt you will either after you give theirs a try.

The combo seems to have completely eliminated the hairballs.  Be careful not to give your cat more than four or five of the hairball control treats per week however, as too many will give them the runs.  My fat cat is a bit slimmer too, but only by three oz.'s.  At least she isn't still gaining weight. I have only given them one bag so far.  I plan to continue.

review/text: We were introduced to these at our local supermarket. When we were no longer able to purchase them there, I tried Amazon and was delighted to find them available. The whole family likes them, especially our 34-month-old granddaughter and our 18-month-old niece. I currently get them on subscription. Since I usually have a few bags on hand, I enjoy passing them out to friends and relatives who try them and ask where I get them.

I purchased mine through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for $8.73 per order *I got 2* 'cause it was such a good price! These normally go for $3.49/per bag in the supermarket/grocery store and usually are not 1 of the type of Pepperidge Farm Cookie that goes on sale at all, unlike their Milano Cookie Brand counterpart which do on a semi-regular basis. A great deal, highly recommended, buy them if the price is right!

review/summary: Tasty... and plenty of them
review/text: These peppers have a nice flavor and look good (no weird-looking strips or questionable coloring).  Yes, this is a lot of red pepper strips.  But I did a little research on-line before buying to see if it's okay to freeze canned peppers (after removing them from the can of course) and found that it was.  I'd include a link but they typically get screened out, so I'll offer that there's a website called Chowhound with a forum that offered good advice and suggestions, both for freezing and what to do with all those peppers.  I rinsed & drained them and froze them on cookie sheets before bagging.  The texture did change somewhat after freezing (a bit mushier) but the taste is fine and it's not like they went into the freezer crispy as they were in water in the first place.  (Just as a general rule, foods with high water content freeze less well.)<br /><br />I wasn't so pleased that both cans arrived with dents. You can't return food on Amazon so that could be an issue if the dents were *really* bad enough to cause concern.  It made opening them a little tricky.  The cans were not well-protected in the box shipped by Amazon, so it's possible the fault lies with Amazon and not the product manufacturer/provider. (Just for the record, after dozens of years and hundreds of canned goods consumed, I can say that I only ever had one -from a supermarket- that WAS truly bad and it was obvious - the contents looked *off* and actually sizzled over the top when opened! Disgusting.)<br /><br />I watched the price on these peppers and got them for under fourteen bucks w/free shipping which I found reasonable.  Now I've got a bunch of little bags of peppers in the freezer to use as needed.  I'm pleased.

There was another review that said the same thing happened to them, I ended up buying it anyway because it was the best price total(product price and shipping).  All I can say is that Amazon should take better care of their products.  I guess it is safe to say that the next person to purchase this item will also get melted chocolate, it's not a big deal, you just need to spend a couple of minutes pulling pices of cardbord from the chocolate before you are able to enjoy it.

review/text: Charleston Vanilla Chew must have been subjected to very high heat as each bar opened so far had the inner part melted and partially leaked to the outside of the chocolate.  To make things worse the melted inner part has welded itself to the cardboard wrapper and cannot be totally removed.  You therefore are eating cardboard with the candy. It is not warm outside so I would be very surprised if the trucking company who delivered it was at fault.

It's called a Cookie & Cracker Assortment on the box. But because of the sugar content of both the animal crackers and the graham crackers those are more cookies than crackers making the box mostly cookies - with the Cheez-It the only true cracker.

review/summary: Perfect for college students
review/text: These snacks maybe most suitable for young children ages 5-12, but they're also perfect for a busy and hungry college student. Why? It's convenient, and it's tasty, perhaps slightly better than your typical vending machine/fast food because of the controlled serving portions (each pouch is about one ounce in weight).<br /><br />As of the time of writing, at $10/box, it's not cheap, but if you compare it against retail/school dining choices, it's kind of a bargain, because each pouch comes out to be about 25 cents per pouch. This is one-fourth of the cost of your average vending machine snack. To make it more worthwhile, for college students, Amazon throws in the free shipping with Amazon Prime, which means that it gets delivered straight to your door, which is a HUGE time saver, because you don't need to drive out to the store and buy snacks. Plus, PORTION CONTROL! (of course, this requires resisting the temptation for second serving of snacks, which admittedly is hard to do so)<br /><br />My least favorite snack in the assortment is the animal crackers. They're just really dry and tasteless, almost like a cardboard substance. But I think they're are only six of them in the box, so it's not too bad.<br /><br />My absolute favorite snack has to be the fudge cookies. They are AMAZINGLY good. The fudge/chocolate melts in your mouth and the cookie is kind of buttery and melts along with the fudge/chocolate. It's really good. My only problem with the cookie is that they market it as a shortbread cookie, which it really isn't ... it's just a fudge cookie. Everyone knows that the Scots/Brits are the best at making shortbread cookie. Nonetheless, digression aside, the fudge cookies are awesome in their own right.<br /><br />Anyways, try one! The assortment isn't perfect, but if you're short on time, you won't regret it.

review/text: You can not go wrong with this box of snacks. It is the perfect amount for that snack just before a meal when the kids can't seem to wait. I hate it when they grab a box of cookies or crackers and end up munching the whole box down before a meal. This solves that. Just limit them to one package and the problem is solved.<br /><br />They are also the perfect size for lunchboxes and diaper bags. Take some with you for a Dr visit or other engagement to keep the kids happy. But best use is for parties and family gatherings so you will not have a big bowl or platter of waste left over. Any uneaten bags are easily restored unlike a plate of stale crackers or cookies the guests just pushed around. Besides having their very own little bag of snacks helps kids feel more comfortable. And will help keep the piggies from eating too much.
