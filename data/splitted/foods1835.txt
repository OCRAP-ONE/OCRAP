review/summary: Pretty good, but a little light
review/text: While brewing the coffee produced a great, room-filling aroma, I was slightly disappointed with the strength of the brew vs other k-cups I've tried.  Still, a delicious coffee at a great price.

review/summary: Am I drinking the same coffee as the 5-star reviewers?
review/text: I don't know how what I tried could be considered the same as what all the rave reviews are coming in for.<br /><br />When we got our new Keurig brewer for Christmas it came with a sample pack of 12 different coffees. We were excited for the opportunity to try different blends before purchasing an entire (pricey) box of any one flavor.<br /><br />To preface: I enjoy flavored coffees. French vanilla, mocha, hazelnut... Pretty much any variety available. I was really excited to try Gloria Jean's Hazelnut since it was one of the few flavored options in the sample pack. I typically enjoy smooth medium roasts and I can't stand bitter coffee with a pungent aftertaste.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this brew is without-a-doubt undrinkable. So bitter and thick. I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend. It smelled burnt as soon as it was brewed. We brewed an 8 ounce cup since typically flavored coffees tend to be weaker so we assumed brewing the smaller size cup would allow us to enjoy to most flavor. The coffee was dark in appearance and both my boyfriend and I tried it befor dumping it out in the sink because the taste was so foul.<br /><br />Aside from its burnt flavor and bitter aftertaste, it's also worth mentioning that I couldn't detect any hazelnut notes at all. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I'd never tried a Gloria Jean brand coffee before and now I'm nervous to try another. I might attempt the Butter Toffee flavor if I can find it in a small pack. But I'll avoid hazelnut from now on.

review/text: If you like hazelnut then you will love this flavor.  Does not taste artificial to me at all.  I use the 7-8 ounce setting and I add vanilla creamer which turns it into vanilla nut.  Yummy!  It is a light roast but full of hazelnut flavor.

review/text: I'm generally not a fan of Hazelnut coffee but even I like this one.  My husband tried this in a sample pack and loved it so I ordered them for him.  I was surprised that the cups arrived loose in the shipping box so make sure you have a container for them as this box doesn't exactly fit in the cabinet the way the small retail boxes do.  That said this coffee has a nice bold taste which works great in a big mug.  We will definitely buy more of these.

review/summary: Hazelnut Heaven
review/text: My husband and I are hazelnut coffee fans.  We've tried every brand of hazelnut K-cups we can find.  The Gloria Jean's is our favorite, even beating out Dunkin' Donut's and Millstone's Hazelnut Cream (which used to be my favorite) hands down.  We always make the largest size cup and there is still plenty of flavor, never watered down or "thin" tasting.  I've always been the major coffee drinker in the house, until we got the Keurig and then the Gloria Jean's Hazelnut.  My husband now drinks 2-4 cups a day!  Make the investment in the Keurig so much more worth it.<br /><br />This purchase is a great deal.  At $0.60 per cup and free shipping, it's a fabulous price and I don't feel like I'm paying extra money for packaging.  It does come in a no-frills box with all 50 of the cups just loose in the large box.  However, we have a holder on the counter which we fill and just keep the box in the pantry to pull from as we need.  If you have a storage situation like a stand or a drawer you keep your K-cups in, you'll have no complaints about them being loose in the box.  We're about to order our second box, and will definitely be repeat buyers!

When a couple people make coffee daily, you can really go through the k-cups, and this product keeps us stocked.  When these arrived, there were one or two that had been damaged in transit, but it didn't really bother me.  I removed the broken cups and transferred the rest to our k-cup staging area.  Definitely a good buy.

At over 50 cents a cup, even on "sale", this is too much. (All K-cup were at one time 30-40 cents now they are 50-60 cents!)<br /><br />For the taste it is weak at best and I am not a strong coffee drinker.  Better flavored Kcups out there but this one is just OK.  I do like some other Gloria Jean's coffee but usually get the bold one's just get a normal cup of coffee.

review/summary: Gloria Jean's Coffee - Hazelnut
review/text: Gloria Jean's Coffees, Hazelnut K-Cups for Keurig.  Tasted fine but was hoping for a bit more Hazelnut flavor.  In their defense I have found most K-Cups not to have a strong flavor like fresh brew coffee.  Product good, would buy again, but the flavor was not over the top.

Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is rich in flavor without the acidy after taste of many others that often upsets your stomach if you enjoy coffee often.  I start out the day with no less than 4 cups and I never get tired of Gloria Jean's.  You simply "must" use the "frustration free" packaging, thank's Amazon!

review/summary: Barely a Hazelnut Flavor from Gloria Jean
review/text: Gloria Jean's cute brand name makes weak coffee. When I go to a gas station or a quick-stop my coffee choice is usually Hazelnut flavor and then I'll kick it up with some Hazelnut flavor creamers. So I happen to like Hazelnut flavored coffee and I drink it often. When I saw the chance to get some for home it looked like a good idea. Idea may have been good but the Gloria Jean Hazelnut flavored coffee fell flat on my taste buds. The best I could give it is 'adequate' since the gas station on my way to work has stuff much better for a fair price. I will use the Gloria Jean stuff up then forget about it because I don't want to be bothered sending it back. Live and learn and take the bad with the good to let an educated perception be my guide.

Only problem is when we received the box, all k-cups were packed inside the box and a couple of k-cup were punctured.  This is caused by the edges from the other k-cups.  We ended up with coffee grounds all inside the box. Very inconvenience.

review/text: When you go through K-cups like I do, this large quantity purchase is perfect.  Hazelnut is always a favorite and this particular brand holds up to a generous cup serving.  Some brands get too watered down in a large mug, but this has body enough to take it.  Since I store my K-cups in a drawer, it doesn't matter that the shipping box is a bare bones container.  I just appreciate the value.  All in all, it's a great way to buy K-cups in quantity.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Superb flavor, excellent value, nice box!
review/text: I'm not really a fan of fruity flavored coffees like raspberry chocolate frappa-mocha-cina or french vanilla twist or what-have-you, but occasionally I do like a hint of hazelnut in my cup of joe, and Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cups handily fill the bill.  The hazelnut taste is fairly subtle, blending well with the rich flavor of the coffee.  I've tested brewing on all 3 settings on our Keurig, and prefer the medium and large cup settings in terms of coffee strength.<br /><br />Buying these on Amazon ends up cheaper than pretty much anywhere else (yes, even cheaper than Bed, Bath and Beyond with the coupons) and the frustration free packaging is great.  Open up the box with your bare hands (no wasteful shrink wrap to throw away or hard plastic that needs to be cut with a knife), and fold the box up for recycling when you're finished.<br /><br />This is my second time ordering this set from Amazon and it won't be my last.  And writing about it reminded me how good it is so I've just gone and made myself another cup!

review/summary: Hazelnut flavor perfect for even hesitant coffee drinkers
review/text: First of all, I'm not a big coffee drinker. I asked for a Keurig for Christmas because I'm a second year law student and I could use a cup of coffee (or 2, or 3) while studying, but I didn't want to drink the Maxwell House that my parents drink. I was enticed by the idea of flavored coffee. This Gloria Jean's Hazelnut does not disappoint. I brew the 8 or 9 oz cup and add 1 tablespoon of fat-free hazelnut creamer, and I'm good to go. It has a nice smell and flavor that makes me feel cozy. Some reviewers would say that this coffee is bitter. I would disagree. I'm gradually warming up to the taste of coffee (I think it must be an acquired taste) and I still shy away from anything with a dark roast or anything with a bitter taste.  If you are like me and are not a huge fan of coffee (unless it is flavored) try this. I'm currently debating purchasing a Gloria Jean's Flavored Coffee Variety Pack along with this giant box of delicious hazelnut.

review/text: Bought these k-cups on a Friday sale and used the subscribe & save option for an excellent deal on another 50 k-cups.  Haven't tried this flavor before, so it was a gamble since I was going to be stuck with 50 coffees if I didn't enjoy it.  Fortunately, the reviews were correct, this is a good, flavorful coffee.  A bit lighter than I was used too, but that enabled me to use less creamer (Chocolate Toffee) than I normally would need.<br /><br />Amazon shipped this package quickly, all were in great shape, and the k-cups don't expire until next March.

review/summary: A fair price but it expired back in 2009...
review/text: I can understand how this appears to be a fairly good price as the k-cups expired back in July 2009... they are over a year old.  However, I do not notice a stale taste, but I wonder if I may be missing out on some freshness.  I plan to contact the seller and find out if all they sell is expired k-cups.

review/summary: The coffee is great but Packaging is terrible!
review/text: The coffee is fine, and the price is a bargain, BUT...when the box was delivered, there was loose coffee coming out of the bottom of the box.  Some of the K-cups were open and had to be thrown away and were not useable.  It looks like the K-cups are just thrown into the carton and some were torn open in the process.  The box was undamaged so the damage was not incurred during shipping.  If it occurs again, I'm going to cancel the subscription.

review/text: Product was shipped a little slow, also ordered the coffee maker @ the same time--which arrived 5 days  before the coffee did.<br />Product did not taste as good as our previous brand (Maxwell house/Hazelnut) or I would nave given a higher rating.<br />I will try another flavor, since this is a good value @ 21.00 for 50 K-cups.

review/text: I used to drive to the local coffee shop for hazelnut coffee or iced hazelnut coffee EVERY DAY! I received a Keurig for a gift, and now, no more added time to my daily commute. It's just delicious hot or iced.

review/summary: Good flavor, albeit a bit weak
review/text: I have had my Keurig for about half a year now.  I have found that many of the k-cups offered make coffee that is a little too weak.  Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is a little weak, but I know that going in when buying the coffee.  This is a good backup economical backup "cup" for me, and guests that don't like strong coffee.

review/text: This was a very good cup of coffee. The only problem was sometimes a little grounds came thru and settled in the bottom of the coffee cup. I liked the packaging being recycled paper.

review/text: This is the best way to buy K-cups!!  It's so inexpensive...especially if you do the "Subscribe & Save".  I'm getting twice as many cups for like $2 more than I was paying in a store for 24 cups.<br />And Gloria Jeans coffee...need I say more...I have at least 2 or 3 ice coffees everyday!!

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: After reading over the reviews for several different coffee brands and flavors, I decided to go with Gloria Jeans Hazelnut and I am so pleased that I did. The price is far less then what I was paying at the stores. The flavor is excellent, the boxing and individual k-cups arrived in perfect condition,(I had read that some did not). I am going to set up for the automatic renewal. What more can I say, it works great for me. Thanks again amazon!!

review/summary: Not that great, wouldn't get again
review/text: I purchased this due to the great reviews which usually does me well.  However, compared to other flavored K-cups (i.e. Timothy's German Chocolate Cake), this lacks flavor & sweet notes and tastes burnt.  I would not order this coffee again, and will likely stay away from Gloria Jean's in general.

review/text: The coffee is very good, and buying from amazon was by far the best deal I found.  I had read a few reviews that suggested people had problems with the cups not working properly during the brewing process, but I haven't experienced that.<br /><br />I would suggest this product if you are looking for an economical cup of coffee that also has a good flavor.

review/summary: Good Coffee but a little messy
review/text: I prefer light/flavored coffee, and these coffee cups hit the spot on cold winter mornings. This is the second time I've purchased coffee with frustration-free packaging, and I like the convenience, but there apparently had been a coffee cup that had broken apart during transport, so there was/is coffee all over the cups and the inside of the packaging, so it's been a little messy. The first time I ordered coffee in frustration-free packaging, no such problem occurred, so I think it's just a fluke. I wish more flavored coffee cups came packaged this way--I'd probably buy more if they did.
