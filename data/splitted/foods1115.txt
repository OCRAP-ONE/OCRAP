review/summary: Starbucks Goodness
review/text: I love Starbucks, but had never tried their ground coffee so I thought I'd give their Vanilla coffee a try. It wasn't quite the same as grabbing a latte at one of their stores, but it was pretty darn good overall. There wasn't as much of a strong vanilla taste as I was expecting, in fact the vanilla was very subtle.<br /><br />It was smooth and rich. Very good coffee and worth the splurge - especially on a cold winters day.

review/summary: Nice
review/text: This is a medium roast coffee with a lovely vanilla flavor.  I don't like strong flavors and this one isn't too bad, had the vanilla been a tad lighter I would have gone 5 stars.  However, the coffee does come through and I would buy it again.  My husband who does not like flavored coffees at all (but does love Starbucks)gave it a try and said it wasn't too bad (which is about as good as anything gets from him).  I do recommend it.

review/summary: a bag of coffee doesn't need 300 reviews....
review/text: This one is pretty good and a good deal especially with the Amazon promotion going on right now.  I use it with my Keurig coffee maker and it's so much nicer than some of the expensive k-cups I purchased.  I can taste the vanilla just fine and it's enough vanilla for me.  Not artificial tasting, just a nice hint of flavor, very smooth.  That's how I like my coffee so this is a good buy for me.  A warning to those who are single...this is ground coffee so buying a lot at a time may not be a good idea.  My 2-pack both expire in May 2011 and at only one cup a day, I may not finish it by then.  So I'm storing the extra bag in the freezer.

review/summary: "Understated" is, in fact, what the vanilla is.  Good description, Starbucks!
review/text: From a coffee standpoint, I thought this wasn't bad.  If you drink Starbucks coffee regularly, it'll taste just fine.  (For those with more refined tastes, I imagine this won't go over quite as well.)  It's definitely a step up from the Folger's and Maxwell's provided at my work.<br /><br />That said, where's the vanilla?  I could barely taste it!  When I tried using more coffee to increase the flavor, the resulting brew was too bitter.  Milk and sugar did nothing to enhance the vanilla flavor.

review/summary: Great coffee underneath vanilla alcohol aftertaste
review/text: The title of this review says it all. There is a great depth of flavor and full robust coffee under a somewhat annoying aftertaste of cheap vanilla extract. I brewed it according to package directions, measuring everything exactly. I figured I could adjust and go from there. The coffee itself is deep, dark, and very robust - just the way I like it. I simply cannot stand what many people like, the common watered-down breakfast or house blends - yuk. I do like an occasional flavored coffee if done right. This time, however, Starbucks simply ruined the concept with that hideous alcohol after bite. If I brew with less coffee, I lose the delicious robustness of the star - the coffee. I wish I knew which bean blend they used as a base. I would buy that on it's own. I won't be purchasing this vanilla fusion any time soon. I may try the cinnamon one next.

review/summary: Smooth and Flavorful
review/text: Though I prefer my coffee plain, bold and with cream (My Starbuck's favorites are Pike's Place and Verona.) I was intrigued by Starbucks new offerings...naturally infused flavored coffee.<br /><br />Starbucks vanilla infusion is a flavorful marriage of both decent coffee and fresh vanilla flavor. Not as bold as Pike's but still bold enough to deliver the coffee flavor I need in the morning to jumpstart my day. The vanilla is strong enough that I didn't wonder what the flavor was supposed to be. It is definitely vanilla but without a cloying fake taste. It makes for a perfect companion to dessert or as a mid-afternoon pick-me-up.<br /><br />I think those who love flavored coffees and especially those who want those flavored coffees to be natural should find much to like in the new Starbuck's fusions.

The blend of Arabica beans and natural vanilla is strong without being overpowering, and it tastes good with either sugar or Splenda.  In fact, I highly re3commend this coffee to anyone who likes something that is strong without tasting like a quart of motor oil.

No more than three days later and it was gone!  Rest assured, this is a good blend!  The star of this Starbucks blend is the vanilla.  The coffee grounds smelled fantastic and once brewed, it tasted wonderful.  I would say its taste was a happy medium- not too over powering nor too light!<br /><br />I can't complain about this product.  It is quite tasty and definitely something I'll be picking up again!

review/summary: Not as good as I hoped
review/text: I drink about two cups of coffee a day and love flavored coffee.  I was excited to get this free to try and I love Starbucks.  This coffee fell short for me.  I made numerous cups trying to perfect the flavor and could never get it to appeal to me.  The cofee is VERY robust.  Had I followed the directions of two tablespoons per cup I might have had a heart attack!  I used less than that and it was way too strong (bitter to me), and yet the vanilla flavor was barely evident. I tried reducing it more and it was still bitter with no vanilla flavor.  The scent is mild.  I will just stick with my Dunkin Donuts brand and add vanilla creamer.  If you like very robust coffee (knock your socks off robust) with only a hint of flavor you will probably like this, it just wasn't for me.

review/summary: Better than Melitta
review/text: This is actually a pretty good vanilla coffee, but the coffee base is much milder than what I prefer - I like my coffee strong. This, however, is so you can taste the vanilla better. When compared to the Melitta vanilla coffee (which was also offered on Vine), this one wins hands down. The vanilla in the starbucks coffee is much milder than the melitta version which allows you to enjoy the coffee itself rather than being overpowered by the vanilla. Overall, if you are looking for a mild, yet well flavored, vanilla coffee, this is a very good choice.

review/summary: Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee
review/text: This review is for Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2). The packaging for this shipment was appropriate, as was the actual bag containing the ground coffee, which included a way for re-sealing to maintain freshness.<br /><br />As for the taste of the coffee, which is really the most important factor, I was not that fond of the vanilla aspect of the flavor. I'm not certain why, but vanilla in Coffeemate tastes fine to me, but the vanilla 'infusion' into this coffee simply tasted too artificial for my palate, even when adding a non-flavored creamer. My advice is to add flavor to your coffee, if desired, only after the brewing process.

review/text: I love coffee - even some "flavored" brews, particularly vanilla (the recent try out of Melitta's Vanilla was a total delight).  That said, I was not favorably impressed with Starbuck's "Vanilla infused" coffee.  While it smelled decent enough, the brew itself had a burnt taste that I have found in most of Starbuck's products which many seem to enjoy, but I do not.  It wasn't "undrinkable" - but I wouldn't ask for a second cup!

review/text: Well, this wasn't too bad. I've never tried any of Starbucks' "flavored" coffees before, preferring the tar-like taste and consistency of their Pike Place and seasonal coffees. But this vanilla-flavored "Natural Fusions" ground coffee...man, that's something special. The vanilla bean flavor isn't overpowering, but it's not too subtle. It's the right median, just want I look for in a flavored blend. Just give me a hint of that flavor, don't hit me over the head with it. And did I mention how aromatic it is? Brew this, and it doubles as a Glade plug-in for your kitchen. Smells wonderful!

review/summary: Vanilla too strong
review/text: Normally, we love Starbucks' coffee, and so we were inclined to like this version of it. However, both me and my Significant Other found the vanilla flavor too strong. For some reason, this is not a pleasant vanilla flavor; I want to say that the aftertaste is a bit on the medicinal side. I wouldn't say the unpleasantness had anything to do with the vanilla flavor being sweet - it wasn't, although to me, not being sweet was a good idea. An added flavor, especially in a coffee labeled "natural fusions", ~should~ be just a taste and not mixed up with sugars or syrup.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this flavor didn't work for two people. The coffee was otherwise full-bodied, but I can't say it was smooth because of the vanilla attack in the flavoring.

This blend does the flavor with such a light hand that unless you're really focused on what you're sipping, you can miss its subtleties.<br /><br />Even if you're a distracted drinker, you'll never miss the richness and overall smooth flavor of this coffee. A giant leap forward from some of the bitter and burnt-tasting brews I've had from Starbucks!

review/summary: Smooth, Not Bitter, but Vanilla?
review/text: I've been drinking coffee every morning of my adult life and in recent years have developed a fondness for flavored coffees. My favorites are mocha, cinnamon, and hazelnut. Thus I welcomed the opportunity to try a Starbucks flavored coffee, Natural Fusions no less.<br /><br />I love opening a fresh container of coffee to experience that heavenly burst of fresh, intense coffee aroma. When my bag of Starbucks Vanilla had its grand opening, I must say I was disappointed by the lack of a distinct vanilla aroma or anything resembling aroma. I figured I'd just have to wait for the actual brew to experience the promised vanilla flavor.<br /><br />So how is the coffee's vanilla flavor? Does it make up for the lack of that heavenly coffee scent that eluded me? Let's put it this way. If I were given a blind taste test,I'd be hard pressed to identfy this coffee as vanilla flavored. In fact, I'm not sure I could match any specific flavor to this coffee. It's obviously flavored to this taster, but I can only recognize that distant, nebulous vanilla taste because of the flavor's word printed on the bag.<br /><br />Overall this is a pleasant coffee. It's smooth, not bitter, and has a pleasant aftertaste. But if you are looking for a readily identifiable vanilla accent, you will have to be satisfied with vageuely vanilla.

review/text: 3 Tries, 3 people and an average rating of 3 Stars.<br /><br />The unanimous conclusion: It's okay.<br /><br />Getting ready to brew our first sample, we agreed that the coffee in the bag smelled spectacular. The process of brewing significantly stripped much of the flavor noted when the bag was opened, but the final product, prepared according to directions, was smooth with a nice flavor.<br /><br />Liking our brew stronger, we made our second sample using more grind than called for in the directions. That time around we all detected a slight bitterness. One person called the aftertaste "chemically," despite Starbucks' assertion of all natural flavorings.<br /><br />The next day, we brewed a third batch in our preferred coffee maker, a french press. The vanilla flavor was more pronounced, but so was the bitterness. None of us finished our individual cups of the french press brewed batch. In Starbucks defense, using a press ignores their directions which specifically say to use a "machine," so we did not weigh this batch heavily in our rating.<br /><br />Overall, we agreed that it is drinkable, but not worth the premium price. Occasional drinkers of not very strong coffee would probably rate this product one star higher.

review/summary: Natural Flavoring
review/text: I enjoy my coffee, and have become rather picky about the coffee I drink.  Normally I avoid Starbucks coffees as I find them too dry.  Starbucks tends to roast coffee beans longer than most companies which reduces the oil content of the product.<br /><br />With the coming of the holiday season I decided to try this starbucks coffee.  I read that instead of using artificial flavoring they make the blend using actual vanilla beans.  Commercial coffee is usually flavored with artificial flavorings.  The ingredients in flavored coffees sometimes are associated with allergic reactions - especially when  propylene glycol is added.  Natural vanilla beans should not have an unhealthy reaction.<br /><br />I tried this coffee for several days.  When it was brewing I detected a slight vanilla aroma.  The coffee provided a pleasant taste, but I did not notice the vanilla.  Overall I rate this coffee above average but intend to return to coffee that is not flavored.

I'm not sure if that's worth buying unless they figure out a better formula.

review/text: Starbucks' Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee sounded so good, I decided to order it when it was offered through the Vine program. And I'm so glad I did! It has a full, rich flavor, which is surprising considering that it is definitely less aromatic than similar vanilla products. In fact, one has to lean in close even to a just opened bag to get a whiff of the vanilla (which for those of us who enjoy the smell of coffee, and particularly flavored coffee, is a disappointment). However, once brewed, the vanilla flavoring comes across in just the right amount. On the second brewing, we (my husband and I) did decide to make it a bit stronger just for personal tastes, but this coffee is smooth and full even without the extra boost. Definitely a coffee we'd both recommend to lovers of flavored coffees!

review/summary: It's coffee and vanilla, how bad can it be?
review/text: I'm not sure exactly why I thought I'd like this Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee, since I usually find Starbucks coffee not to my taste. The ground coffee has a nice vanilla smell while it's still in the bag but my first sip was a huge disappointment--it tasted decidedly harsh. I tried brewing it stronger and weaker; still harsh, almost acidic. The only thing that made it drinkable was adding quite a bit of sugar, and I really don't care for my coffee that way.<br /><br />The ingredient list claims "ground vanilla beans," which I wouldn't expect to have a harsh acidic taste. Vanilla is the second most expensive spice in the world (after saffron) and grinding the beans is known to be a good way of dispersing the flavor through hot liquids. How can it have gone so wrong in this product? Is it the coffee itself that's so unappetizing, or the combination? I just don't know.<br /><br />From now on I'll look for vanilla in baked goods and body lotion, and keep it out of my coffee. Sorry, Starbucks, I'm not a fan of this brew.<br /><br />Two stars, not really for the coffee but to encourage Starbucks to do better with recycling and other green issues, and to increase fair trade initiatives.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2010

Beyond that, it is pre-ground and the beans, vacuum sealed, seemed to be as fresh as they could possibly be (couldn't smell it before opening it, therefore nice packaging).<br /><br />For those who knows what it is, we use an Aeropress coffee maker.<br /><br />The taste definitely has that "starbucks" flavor, which is a little more roasted than I would prefer, but if you like starbucks coffee, this does have that taste you'll recognize.<br /><br />Honestly, even though it wasn't horrible, I'm not a huge starbucks fan and it is pre-ground coffee (I am spoiled by freshly ground coffee). However, it is better than your every day instant coffee... it may sound a little negative, but it's not what I'm intending. It's not bad coffee; just not my cup of coffee.

review/summary: OK, but not all that
review/text: I smelled the vanilla when I initially opened the bag but upon brewing it I really couldn't say I detected any vanilla flavoring.  We've made the entire bag and I had no impression that I was drinking anything other than just black coffee, no vanilla undertones.  I asked my husband what he thought about the vanilla coffee and he said, "what vanilla coffee?"  He couldn't even tell.  Nevertheless, it's starbucks and still a good cup of joe.

review/summary: My favorite vanilla coffee, but its still vanilla coffee
review/text: As a die-hard Starbucks fanatic, I feel like its wrong to add flavorings to coffee.  This is the 3rd (and final) vanilla coffee I've tried over the last several months.  Ready for something new and different, vanilla seems a natural addition to coffee so it sounded worth trying.  This is definitely the best of the 3, (see my other reviews) for 2 primary reasons:  the coffee is better, and the vanilla is more subtle.<br />Made in a French press, according to the proportions advised on the side of the bag, Starbucks Natural Fusions produces a medium bold brew with a subtle, but not too sweet vanilla undertone.  The smell of vanilla is most pronounced upon opening the sealed foil bag.  After brewing, it is fairly subtle.  The coffee is smooth and not as acidic as some bolder brews I know and love.  The vanilla is enjoyable due to its lack of sweetness.<br />Overall, a fine cup of coffee, most suitable for drinking with dessert after dinner.  It has been my morning brew for a couple weeks, and I'm ready to return to Sumatra blend.  But for those who enjoy a flavored coffee, this one is highly recommended.

review/summary: Good Flavored Coffee
review/text: I drink a lot of coffee. I like Starbucks coffee. Given the opportunity to review Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla with other natural flavors, I was looking forward to giving it a try. Full disclosure, I like dark roast and am not generally fond of flavored coffees. However, I really like vanilla and wondered if a Starbucks flavored coffee would be superior to other brands I've tried.  I brewed up a pot a work and everyone who liked flavored coffees, really liked Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla flavored ground coffee. It is a light flavor and the aroma is pleasant. For me, it still had that slightly chemically taste that I associate with flavored coffees and it wasn't a dark enough roast for me. I do think that this is a superior product to other flavored coffees I've tried.  I recommend it for people who like vanilla flavored coffee.<br /><br />The ingredients are Ground Coffee, Natural Flavor (with Corn Maltodextrin, Vegetable Glycerin), Ground Vanilla Beans, Indian sarsaparilla Root.  The package says 100% Responsibly grown. Ethically traded.

review/text: Taste: The taste was mild, not bitter. I enjoyed the infusion of vanilla flavoring, which wasn't too strong. All around good coffee.<br /><br />Serving sizes: I really didn't use a full suggested size of the grounds. I just don't like that strong of coffee. So each bag for me will produce around 100 cups.<br /><br />Cost: If you do the math, 100 cups of Starbucks barista prepared coffee is about $275 dollars compared to the $7.50 you paid for make it yourself option. I think it's self-evident what is the greater value in this matter.<br /><br />Summation: If you want a little variety in your daily coffee dose, and enjoy a moderately strong coffee, then this should be a given choice for you to make.

review/summary: Vanilla Flavored COFFEE, not Coffee Flavored Vanilla
review/text: A very nice flavored coffee. Too many coffees that are flavored suffer from the flavor overwhelming the taste of the coffee. This coffee has the hint of vanilla but does not block out the flavor of the coffee itself.<br />It is kind of like when you use the flavored creamers at a restaurant or coffee shop. Put in two or three of them and the flavoring of the creamer almost totally blocks out any coffee taste,<br />So if you want to achieve that hint of vanilla, I use a half of one container of the vanilla creamer and then a full container of plain creamer.<br />Same result, only the Starbuck's vanilla is a richer tasting vanilla that that used in creamers.<br />It is like the same difference between using Irish Cream flavored creamer versus using actual Bailey's in your coffee. One is very artificial and superficial while the other is rich and enhances the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />By the way, I rarely drink Starbuck's coffee because I don't like it. In fact I have never been in a Starbuck's but my Daughter and Granddaughter like their coffee and I have drunk coffee they have brought home from Starbuck's so I do know what their various flavors of coffee do taste like. So for me, this tastes like is a major improvement in their product.<br /><br />I do drink coffee and have probably drank thousands of gallons of it in my life, though I prefer tea, usually Tetley which I drink about four cups a day of. In fact I have my next 3 month supply of 400 bags being shipped by Amazon today because nobody sells it for less than they do.

review/text: I received this coffee through the Vine program, and now that I've calibrated the amount needed for the perfect pot (for my taste), I really like it.  I'll say right away that if you use as much coffee as they suggest, you'll probably end up using it to clean your counters.  Starbucks' suggestion of two tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 oz cup is more than twice what I settled on....... and I do like my coffee on the strong side.  The vanilla is very pleasing.. just enough flavor without overpowering the coffee.  This makes for a very nice mid-afternoon treat.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I find most "flavored" coffee to be sub-par coffee doused with some kind of perfumey scent so that hopefully you'll focus on how great it smells and won't notice how awful it tastes. This vanilla-infused coffee from Starbucks, however, is delicious. It's a good coffee with actual chunks of ground-up vanilla bean mixed in, so that when the hot water runs through your grounds, it brings a touch of vanilla with it. I've tried different combinations (1 part this coffee to 2 parts of my normal coffee) with good results.<br /><br />The best, however, was a cup of this coffee mixed with Bailey's Irish Cream. Divine, and highly recommended.

review/summary: Very Mildly Infused
review/text: This is a pleasant coffee, just be aware that it only very mildly infused in my opinion.<br /><br />Coffee is a very personal thing, some like strong bold flavors, deep roasts and powerful flavor notes.  Others prefer a more delicate palate.  This coffee very definitely fits that second description.<br /><br />The vanilla aroma, was noticeable when we opened the bag at home and the freshly brewed pot defintely gave off a pleasant vanilla scent.  That said, both experiences were mild, much milder than I have experienced with other vanilla coffees and light years away from what a vanilla flavored creamer would do to your cup of coffee. In fact I found that the vanilla notes were mild enough that they could be overpowered by sugar and cream. If you like your coffee this way, this is something to note.<br /><br />The coffee was also of a medium roast and milder than what Starbucks would call "bold" in their stores, and additionally milder than what I would call medium in their stores.  Not harsh or acidic as others have said, though bolder than what I normally drink in the morning.<br /><br />In summary, this is a pleasant coffee with medium roast character very very mild vanilla notes.  Recommended for those prefer a delicately flavored coffee with these characteristics.  For those searching for bolder notes, I would recommend looking elsewhere.

review/summary: awakening aroma and smooth  flavor
review/text: Not many Starbucks lovers who would say anything bad about Starbucks coffees, huh?  That's especially true of me.  This coffee smells wonderful when brewing in the kitchen.  The vanilla aroma spreads throughout the kitchen and makes everything smell good.  As its just before Christmas, I imagine the vanilla smelling a little Christmas-y.  The vanilla flavor comes out best, to my taste buds, with no flavored creamer, no plain creamer, and maybe 1/2 a teaspoon of sugar.  I tried a cup of it with Hazelnut flavored creamer and while I love that flavored creamer, it, of course, drowned out the subtle flavor of the vanilla coffee.  I recommend that drinkers of flavored coffee and those who like Starbucks try this coffee.  I give everything a grade and this vanilla flavored coffee from Starbucks is a solid "A".

review/summary: A Good Prelude to the Real Thing
review/text: If you are an avid Starbuck's coffee drinker, the Natural Fusions coffee is not for you.  Plain and simple.  Now, if you are a Starbuck's drinker and looking for a good 'out the door' coffee that will hold you until you get to your local Starbuck's store, then this coffee is a good choice.  I liken the Starbuck's bagged coffees versus the chain offerings to bottled Coca Cola versus fountain Coca Cola.  The former is fantastic and the latter is just okay.<br /><br />I actually found myself using a few more scoops of the bagged Natural Fusions coffee in an attempt to make it taste more like the original.  I guess if I didn't know how good the real thing was, I would have given this coffee at least 4 stars.  It's good, but not nearly as good as the real thing.  Is it better than other bagged choices out there?  Not as good as the best offerings, in my opinion, but better than most.

review/summary: Taste OK; Persistent After-taste
review/text: Preparation: I drink my coffee black.  I experimented with various strengths around the recommended measure.  Most of my preps were done in a French Press Pot, hoping that this would hold more of the volatile vanilla until it was served (vs a drip preparation).<br /><br />There was at most a very faint taste or smell of vanilla when drinking. In stronger preps, there was none. However, there is a persistent after-taste, part of which was the smell of vanilla and the other parts being coffee and something I couldn't characterize. At a normal strength brew, I didn't find the after-taste itself to be the problem, but rather its persistence (for hours).  In stronger brews, the drink and the after-taste had a prominent burnt and acidic taste (a characterization often used by non-fans of Starbucks).<br /><br />My _awareness_ of the after-taste declined significantly in subsequent days.  However, since a major use of flavored coffees is when entertaining, many of the drinkers won't be desensitized.<br /><br />The most pleasant part of the experience with this coffee was the smell while scooping it from the bag and disposing of the grounds--both had a pleasant vanilla smell.<br /><br />If it weren't for the persistent after-taste, I would have rated this 4-stars, being what you should expect relative to other coffees from Starbucks. Since how one views the good-ness of Starbucks-style coffee is a matter of personal taste and hence should be factored in by the reader, not by this reviewer.

review/summary: Consistently Very Good
review/text: I have sampled various types of Starbucks flavored coffee over the years, and I have found that Starbucks coffee, no matter what the flavor, is usually very consistent.  Upon opening the bag and brewing my first cup, I knew that Starbucks had a winner here.<br />I like my coffee strong; perhaps this comes from drinking it daily. In any event I found that the vanilla flavored Natural Fusions coffee produced a strong (but not bitter) cup of coffee. The vanilla is a nice balance to the bold Starbucks coffee and makes this a good coffee to drink both iced and hot. One thing I did notice, which I did not like, was a sweet aftertaste. The vanilla flavoring is not overwhelming, so I was surprised with the aftertaste. Of course taste is totally subjective, and others who drink this coffee may not notice, or be bothered, by the aftertaste.<br />Bottom line, I would certainly recommend this, especially if you like vanilla ground coffee.

As the concoction brews you are carried to a Tropical Paradise even as you watch snowflakes falling outside the frost covered window of the house.  You pour the dark elegant liquid in your cup and watch the steam rise off the surface.  Your nose tells your taste buds that this is going to be a feast for the senses.  You look at the sugar bowl but turn away as you want to savor the full flavor of this noble brew tinted with vanilla.  You finally succumb to temptation and each sip warms your body and excites your palate as you enjoy the perfect cup of morning bliss.<br /><br />Enjoy it I and my family did.  This is a full flavored coffee and the vanilla only adds an accent to it and is not overpowering at all.  I believe I saw some vanilla bean shavings among the grounds too so this is the real thing, not just an artificial flavoring.  While I don't purchased gourmet coffees like this for everyday use we do enjoy them on special occasions and the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla will be at the top of my list for Christmas and New Years Mornings.

review/summary: Holy Bitter Coffee Batman!
review/text: I must begin by saying I love flavored coffee.  However, in my opinion, many flavored coffees tend to be terribly overpowering to the point where I typically brew my flavored coffee with a 50/50 mix of flavored coffee to regular coffee.  Normally I brew my coffee with 1 tablespoon of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water and use 1 packet of sugar per cup.<br /><br />I must admit that traditionally I am not a huge fan of Starbucks.  While they put out an excellent quality product, I think their beans tend to be over roasted.  However, I am the first to say it is still a decent cup of coffee.  So when I had the opportunity to try the Starbucks Natural Fusions line, I jumped on the chance.  When I received my bag of Starbucks Vanilla flavored coffee, I pulled out the coffee maker and brewed up a cup.<br /><br />The bouquet of the coffee grounds was a bit unusual.  There was a definite aroma of fine coffee beans, but there was an underlying odor that I can not place.  The ground coffee did not have a distinct vanilla aroma that I could detect.  The same was true with a brewed cup.  While there was a distinctive coffee scent, I still could detect the mystery scent which still did not smell like vanilla to me.<br /><br />The first sip resulted in an overpowering bitter flavor.  Having spent significant time in the Caribbean and South America, I am no stranger to the strong brewed coffees that are prevalent in some countries I have been to.  I am unsure of the source of the bitterness in the coffee (maybe the sarsaparilla root listed in the ingredients), but the bitter flavor was very significant.  The bitter flavor did become less noticeable with the more coffee I drank.  While I became accustomed to the bitterness, it never really went completely away.<br /><br />I really did not detect any vanilla flavor in the coffee, even when used at full strength.  In my opinion, the bitterness really detracts from any flavor of the coffee.  I am sure some people might love this aspect of the coffee, but for me it did not work.<br /><br />Overall, this did not seem to be a bad cup of coffee, but I just could not get past the overwhelming bitter flavor.  I would recommend this blend to people who like an intense, bitter flavor to their coffee.  If you prefer a milder cup of joe, then I would pass on this coffee.  I think this will be a wonderful product for the right person; however, that person just is not me.<br /><br />J. E. Nelson

review/summary: Personally, I would never buy it or recommend it to a friend...
review/text: Yes, I did smell the vanilla (and even saw it) when I opened the bag and pour the contents out. However, once the coffee was made, the taste was a disappointment to myself. Perhaps I got used to another coffee which was much more to my liking. In any case, not only did this coffee taste bitter to me, but the vanilla taste was weaker than I expected (again, this is in comparison to another vanilla-flavored coffee I've had, which gave me a stronger vanilla "experience"). This Starbucks product is pretty strong coffee (the instructions tell you to use 2 TBS of ground coffee for 6 ounces of water) and to my taste - seems quite bitter if I follow their instructions. However, once I add some milk to it, the bitterness is masked somewhat - but I would not drink this black if I have a choice. Personally, I would not buy it myself or recommend this product to a friend.

review/summary: Subtle, not over-powering vanilla flavored coffee that's smooth and delicious
review/text: I'm usually not a fan of flavored coffees but I do have a weakness for all things vanilla.  So I decided to try out a bag of Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla flavored coffee. I brew all of my coffee in a vintage early 1960s Revere Ware Vintage Percolator.  When I brew up a pot of this coffee, the aroma that fills the kitchen isn't overpowering like some other vanilla-flavored coffees I have tried in the past are. Very subtle but still distinct.<br /><br />This coffee is very strong, however (which I like) and so may not be for everyone. I tend to add a generous amount of half-and-half and sugar, which in my opinion makes this coffee one of my favorites. I particularly enjoy a cup after a big dinner, with pie and ice cream. Heaven!

review/text: I really thought this would be delicious.  Starbucks coffee usually tastes great and I love vanilla flavored anything.  First off, when opening the bag I didn't smell vanilla.  At all.  The coffee grounds were large and uneven looking.  Sort of odd to me.  I brewed a pot, still no vanilla smell, and there was no vanilla taste at all.  There was some sort of odd, bitter taste, almost as if the coffee was old or something.  Hard to describe, but it was kind of musty tasting! I tried two more pots just to be sure before I gave up on this.  I even gave my coffee maker a good cleaning, but it was the coffee itself, not the maker.  I ended up throwing the rest of the bag away.  Very disappointing.

review/text: Excellent true vanilla coffee. Pretty much has D&D beat as well as other brands. Nice smooth consistant flavor. Had to add a tad more to the coffee pot to achieve the flavor but overall a great product.

review/summary: Great taste, a tad sweet, amazing smell
review/text: This Starbucks coffee is delicious. For pre-ground coffee, the beans are very fresh compared to other brands. This coffee has a very aromatic vanilla flavor with a hint of sweetness. It has that familiar Starbucks kick to get you going in the morning. Goes perfect with a croissant or delicate morning pastry.  Now if Starbucks offered this is certified organic coffee, I'd be in coffee-lovers Heaven.

review/summary: Bitter
review/text: I have to say at the outset that I'm generally not partial to flavored coffees. I prefer my coffee without added tastes.<br /><br />I prepared the Starbucks Vanilla Flavored in a Cuisinart drip-machine per the instructions on the package - 10 grams of coffee to each 6 ounces of water. I used a Melitta brown paper filter. I found the brewed coffee extremely bitter and not very flavorful. I experimented with varying the coffee/water ratio to try to get a better result, but was unsuccessful.<br /><br />I'm convinced that brewing coffee is one of the "dark arts" and that's why I give this Starbucks 3 stars rather than 1 or 2. My experience may be the result of the way I made the coffee, my machine, my water, my filter, my tastebuds or some combination of these.

review/summary: It's vanilla, but it still tastes like Starbucks
review/text: If you like Starbucks coffee, you will probably like the vanilla flavored version quite well; the vanilla is quite noticeable, but not too strong, and very fragrant and pleasant. If, like me, you find Starbucks coffee to have a burned flavor, then this is better than some Starbucks blends, but it still has the signature burnt-popcorn undertone. To each his own, I say!

review/summary: It's "natural" for a reason.
review/text: I'm usually one to try new coffee flavors, though vanilla is definitely one of my favorites. So, I was more than happy to see what Starbucks meant by "Natural Fusions".<br /><br />As it turns out, the branding is pretty accurate.<br /><br />Rather than an overpowering candy-like vanilla that you'd get by using a flavored creamer, or most store-brand flavored coffees, Starbucks Natural Fusions tastes almost like they package a couple of vanilla beans in with plain coffee. The flavor and aroma are definitely present, but it's really much more like their House Blend with a touch of something extra.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice "anytime" brew that doesn't fight cream and sugar, and doesn't have the harsh aftertaste that's often present in Starbucks blends.

review/summary: Met expectations, sadly.
review/text: Nice packaging.  Makes one imagine rich vanilla flavor -- upon opening, this just smells rather thin, a sense reinforced when actually brewed.  VERY thin vanilla flavor.  I'd say delicate, but a more appropriate term would be weak.<br /><br />But the coffee isn't weak:  if you're into Starbucks' fare, this won't disappoint.  Since I'm not into Starbucks' fare (I subscribe to the narrative that they've hoodwinked the country into blithely accepting the fallacy that strong, acidic/bitter coffee is Primo, which it isn't), I wasn't surprised by the rather nasty aftertaste that not even 3-4 sugars per cup can mask.<br /><br />I love strong coffee, but good coffee can be strong and not offensively acidic with a bite at the end of the quaff that can peel taste-buds off.  It's all in the beans and the roast.  I don't know why Starbucks foists off fare like this on the public; oh, yes I do -- because it sells to those who don't know better.<br /><br />And, I see we're down to 11 (yes, ELEVEN) oz. "pounds" of coffee.  Why send 2 packages of 11 oz. (2 x 11 = 22), when one could just put it all into a true "pound and a half" 24 oz. bag?  It just makes no sense, the packaging costs are higher, and it's hardly more environmentally friendly this way.<br /><br />When I tell people I used to live in Seattle, they frequently say, "OH, you must have gone to Starbucks all of the time."  "Only when I had no other choice," is my response.  If one is willing to pay boutique prices for coffee, one can do FAR better.  In fact, even if one is NOT willing to pay boutique prices for coffee....

review/text: I am so happy with this coffee! I really enjoy vanilla flavored coffee, but so many of them have an artificial flavor and have a "fake" aftertaste. The whole concept of the Natural Fusions is definitely accurate. Great taste, nothing artificial, and the flavor is really subtle, so you're not bombarded with a sweet taste.<br /><br />I am really impressed with this one and will be trying out other Natural Fusion flavors.

review/summary: Starbucks Natural Fusions Not for me........
review/text: I am a HUGH Coffee Fan. I also drink teas but coffees are my favorite....and I have had coffees from all over at one time or another.<br /><br />This particular coffee--Starbucks Natural Fusion Vanilla  Coffee was right up my alley or at least I thought.<br /><br />Starbucks in known around the world.....and I know many people flock to the stores in enjoy it. Thus my desire to try this form out.<br /><br />The packaging of this coffee and the coffees'  form itself is excellent. Packaging is airtight yet rather easy to handle open and close---having both the "tape " closure and the side tabs.<br /><br />My issue here was the taste of the coffee itself.<br /><br />When one thinks Vanilla  Flavored Coffee it is a gentle feeling...a tasteful feeling....and instead with this you get the feeling of being beaten with a baseball bat. Hughly over caffeinated heavily dark , dense almost bitter tasting  coffee infused with a minisclue amount of Vanilla and other flavorings .<br /><br />The Vanilla flavor barely makes it through the first cup of coffee---and certainly not to the end of the brewed pot.<br /><br />They do not mention the actual beans used here though on the package they mention a "accent" of vanilla.<br /><br />Well , what ever they are using for me is just NOT enough. Furthermore...the taste of the base coffee used in this mix is simply way too strong for a delicate flavor as is Vanilla.<br /><br />The caffeine level is enough to give you a headache.<br /><br />Now as usual I must say that another person  that enjoys those heavy , dark ,  dense coffees may very well enjoy this one...but for me..................well.......its just not my cup of coffee.

I found it a little weak and while I could SMELL the vanilla, I definately couldn't taste it. I brewed this up in a french press and in a regular coffee maker. Same results both times.<br /><br />I'm not a big coffee person to begin with, so caffine hits me pretty hard. Zero caffine buzz. That wouldn't be a big deal if this had more flavor, but it just doesn't.<br /><br />Skip it and go for the cheap stuff.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: This coffee has a strong vanilla aroma, but the flavor in the cup is not strong at all; in fact, it's barely noticeable, just kind of a highlight.  This is a fairly smooth, mellow cup of coffee, if you're careful to use the right amount in the brewing.  However, I always find that Starbucks coffees have a sort of burnt edge to the flavor, as if the beans were over-roasted, and this one is no exception.  I also have a commitment to purchasing fair trade, sustainably grown, bird-friendly coffee, and Starbucks does not qualify on any of those counts.  I'm not downgrading the coffee for this -- the 3-star rating is based just on the flavor -- but since Starbucks does not meet these expectations, it's not a brand I will choose in the future for a regular coffee.

review/summary: Gets an "mediocre" from a non-coffee person
review/text: First a warning - I'm not a coffee person.  I generally don't drink coffee and I definitely don't pay $5 for a grande tall whatever the heck. Every once and a while though, I do like my coffee flavored desserts. For someone like me, you won't like this coffee.  For me all you can really taste is the Starbucks "burnt" flavor with a bit of vanilla flavoring. When I asked my friend to try this stuff, he said "Yeah, tastes like old Starbucks."  This particular Starbucks flavor comes pre-ground, which immediately starts the decay of the coffee's various oils and flavor notes. There's even a warning on the bag which recommends using the grounds within a week of opening the bag. This may not be an issue for most die-hard coffee drinkers, but for me, much of this bag will probably go to waste.<br /><br />Generally speaking, this Starbucks bagged coffee tasted like that flavor of beans at the local Starbucks that no one likes, so it's been sitting there for weeks. It's still very "coffee" in flavor, but slightly off, slightly milder, slightly weaker. While absolutely drinkable, it's not going to be like visiting a Starbucks.

review/summary: A bit too much of a dark roast for my taste
review/text: The Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee Vanilla Flavor tastes bitter to me. I believe it's because this is a darker roast than what I prefer. The first pot I made, I made like I would my normal every day coffee. It came out way too strong and way too bitter. The next pot I made I put in less coffee and it came out better, but still a little on the bitter side. I finally got so that I added 1/3 the amount of this coffee than I would my normal brand and it finally came out decent. Coffee is one of those things that is very individual to each person and their taste. What one person may not like, another might. If you like darker roasted coffee then this would be perfect for you. If you prefer a lighter roast, you may want to pass on this or do what I did and make it much weaker than you would your normal brand. The Vanilla flavor is ok, but I prefer another brand of Vanilla coffee (DD are the initials). Overall, not horrible, but not great and if given a choice between this and DD vanilla coffee I would pick DD. Again, this is just my personal preference and taste.

review/summary: Good vanilla flavor  in a a relatively mild coffee
review/text: I usually like strong , dark roast coffee and find most flavored coffees to be strong on the (often phony) flavor and weak on the coffee taste.  This coffee was better than I thought it would be, in that it had a distinct but not overpowering vanilla taste that nicely complemented coffee that was milder than most Starbuck's coffee.  I am not likely to switch to this coffee on a regular basis but do think it is good for someone who likes flavored coffees and might think that most Starbuck's blends are too strong. The vanilla flavor is pleasant and not overpowering (e.g., doesn't taste like a milkshake).

review/summary: The Cubicle Crew has spoken!
review/text: I decided that my thoughts alone weren't sufficient to review this coffee, so I took this into my office and had my coworkers try it out.<br /><br />My Cubicle Cohorts have been known to maim anyone responsible for bad coffee, and I was prepared to either smile pleasantly and accept their thanks, or run for the fire escape and use my swivel chair as a battering ram.<br /><br />The first person who tried it had this to say:<br /><br />"I enjoyed the coffee. Starbucks is usually very strong and bitter but this was not. It was mellow, tasteful, and the right amount of vanilla. It would be a product that I would purchase and brew at home."<br /><br />That's some high praise from our regular cubicle coffee supplier!<br /><br />Another person (our cubicle tea drinker) happily offered her opinion:<br /><br />"Very tasty.  To me the aroma is better than the taste though.  Is that their travel instant coffee?  If so, I like the caramel one better even though I really do like vanilla."  *grin*<br /><br />And our official CS (Coffee Snob) had this to say:<br /><br />"It has a mild flavor.  Unlike most Starbucks coffees it does not have the bitter, highly acidic taste one comes to expect from Starbucks.  It does have a bit of a vanilla aftertaste that reminds this taster of French Vanilla ice cream...One cannot taste the strength of the roast and the coffee does not have the typical burned flavor of a Starbucks roast.  That is a refreshing departure from what I normally find with their coffees.<br /><br />The positives of this coffee are:<br />1. A subtle, pleasing aroma<br />2. A lighter flavor and taste<br />3. It is a smooth coffee<br /><br />The negatives are:<br /><br />1. The vanilla aftertaste grows stronger the more coffee that I drink<br />2. It seems to be too light of a roast for my tastes, I prefer a medium to dark roast"<br /><br />And finally, our CSIT (Coffee Snob In Training) offered these thoughts:<br /><br />"This being a Starbucks blend, the initial taste does contain the trademark bitterness of Starbucks coffee, which may turn off the less seasoned coffee drinker...unlike most other vanilla coffee brews, there is no creamy texture to accompany the hint of vanilla.<br /><br />On subsequent tastes, the vanilla flavor stays consistently subtle so as not to overpower the coffee's flavor.  When this blend is sweetened, however, the vanilla changes to a caramel flavor, which may disappoint those looking to be overcome with the subtle sweetness and aroma of Vanilla.  This blend is best enjoyed either lightly sweetened or unsweetened at all, which may leave many outside the ardent coffee drinker crowd with a bitter tasting disappointment.  True Brew lovers will no doubt appreciate a vanilla coffee that is more subtle and tastes like, well...coffee, and not a vanilla milkshake."<br /><br />As for myself?<br /><br />Well, I felt a hint of the bitters that Starbucks coffee is known for, but I was pleased to find the taste of vanilla with a hint of caramel (as previously stated). T'was a tasty coffee, and the masses appear to agree.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Natural Flavoring doesn't equal better flavoring
review/text: First, a confession. I typically don't drink flavored coffee, especially after learning that most flavored coffee is artificially flavored and usually is made with inferior beans. Still, I like most Starbucks coffee and welcomed their new take on flavored coffee. Opening up the bag, it smells wonderful and you can see small pieces of vanilla bean in with the coffee. I make my coffee fairly strong in a Braun drip pot. I found this coffee has some vanilla taste, but such an unpleasant aftertaste that I will finish the bag I have, but will not likely buy any more. I don't think they make this at their stores, so unfortunately you have to try a while bag to decide if you like it or not.

review/text: When brewing Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored coffee, I found the smell to be tantalizing and pleasantly inviting. However, upon the very first sip, I couldn't believe how far from vanilla taste this coffee was. It did seem to have a slight vanilla flavor, but nothing like I would have expected or preferred.  There was a slight bitterness present. The taste has a lot to be desired - at least for me.  I really wanted to like this coffee, but to no avail.  Every cup just reinforced my negative feeling. When it comes to vanilla-flavored coffee, I prefer other brands to this one.

review/summary: A bit bitter but with right amount of cream, it smoothes out
review/text: Starbucks's Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavor, has a wonderful aroma while brewing. Also, I could tell it is quality because I didn't need as much to put into the coffee maker. When I put in the same measurement as I do my regular coffee, the Starbucks blend would come out too strong.<br /><br />Once I got the measurement down, it made a nice cup of coffee. The vanilla is not too strong. I got a hint of mint from it as well. It does have a bit of a bite on aftertaste but when I put the right amount of cream, it was very tasty and smooth.<br /><br />I have had as both hot and iced and while both versions were good, I actually prefer it iced which is saying something because usually I only like iced coffee from a coffee shop like Starbucks.<br /><br />I will probably look at other flavors of this brand and try them out too.

review/summary: Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee Tastes Great When Brewed With A Keurig One-Cup Coffee Maker
review/text: My parents and I enjoyed drinking Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Ground Coffee over the holidays.  Mom graciously made it with her antiquated percolator.  The coffee had an aromatic smell and rich flavor.  We drank it with International Delight Vanilla Latte Creamer.  I also drank it alone with Stevia, which is an all-natural sweetener used by health conscious people.  The Stevia enhances the vanilla flavor but I prefer using the creamer.  See my posted photograph.<br /><br />  I enjoy drinking coffee on cold winter mornings in order to warm and awaken me.  However, I don't want too much caffeine or I'll become jittery and agitated.  The recipe (instructions) on the bag calls for 2 Tbsp (10g) ground coffee for every 6 fl oz (180 ml) water.  My parents and I made it with 1 Tbsp ground coffee for every 6 fl oz.  The coffee still tasted great but it only had one-half the caffeine.<br /><br />  When I returned to work after the Thanksgiving holidays, I brewed the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Ground Coffee using my Keurig Mini Brewer, which makes individual cups of coffee.  I scooped the Starbucks Coffee into the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter.  I also used International Delight French Vanilla Creamer.  My vanilla coffee was excellent.  It tastes much better than the coffee I brew using the French Vanilla K-Cups from Van Houtte and Green Mountain Coffee.  (See my posted photograph.)  Using Starbucks Natural Fusion Vanilla Ground Coffee in the My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter will save me a lot of money.  I personally believe that Starbucks would profit tremendously if they manufactured K-Cups for the Keurig.<br /><br />  As an extra bonus, the empty Starbucks Coffee bag can be taken to a local Starbucks restaurant and exchanged for a free tall (12oz) brewed coffee. I actually took this to my local Starbucks.  The barista gladly accepted the bag.  I enjoyed drinking the free coffee while eating a delicious Tarragon Chicken Salad Sandwich.  The meal and atmosphere were excellent.  After eating, I drank my coffee (I even got a refill) while comfortably reading a novel.  I'll have to go back to Starbucks again.<br /><br />  I think I'm hooked on the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Ground Coffee.  I'm going to have to try the other flavors in this new line, which include caramel and cinnamon.  (They are all available in most grocery stores.)  However, I've been drinking vanilla flavored coffee ever since I bought my Keurig One-cup Coffee Maker.  The Starbucks Natural Fusions is highly recommended for those who own a Keurig.  I used it to make coffee for several of my coworkers and they loved it.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos

review/text: When Starbucks does coffee, they tend to go all-in.  They have twice the caffeine as most other brands, they really roast their beans (some may say burn?), so I would expect their foray into flavored coffees to overwhelm as well.  Except, that's not happening.  The ingredients are tame, coffee, vanilla, and sarsaparilla -- that's it!  The flavor is nice and the flavor of vanilla is subtle, not overpowering.<br /><br />The aroma, on the other hand, is quite strong.  I brought the empty bag in here to refer to while I write this review and the office now smells like vanilla.  Vanilla aroma also wanders throughout the house as each new pot of coffee is brewed. It's a pleasant scent, though.  I'll take it over the stench of air fresheners any day.<br /><br />Would I pay twice the price for this versus a competing brand?  No, but I'd pay a little more.

review/summary: It's Grown On Me
review/text: I did not like this coffee at first, because I didn't think it lived up to the smell it had in the bag. I could smell the vanilla, but somehow it didn't translate into the taste. I make my coffee the old fashioned way, with a percolator that I inherited from my grandfather. I like doing it that way, because it gives the whole house a nice coffee smell in the morning and this coffee didn't disappoint smell wise and it didn't really disappoint taste wise, it's just that it didn't quiet live up to the promise of being vanilla flavored.<br /><br />Yes there is a hint of vanilla and if I would have ordered this at Starbucks, I might not have ordered it a second time. But I had the bag and I don't like to waste, so I did make it a second time, and a third, and a fourth and so on and now it's kinda grown on me, so four stars.

review/summary: Excellent Flavored Coffee!
review/text: I'm picky about my coffee (as my husband will attest!) so I was curious to try the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee. I have been very pleased with it. Smooth, rich and flavorful, it makes a delicious pot of coffee! I'd highly recommend this, especially if you enjoy flavored, vanilla coffee. It's an excellent product and serves up a satisfying, delicious and enjoyable cuppa--whether for breakfast, break or after dinner. Definitely a 5 star rating in my book!

review/summary: Fairly strong vanilla scent, not as much vanilla taste
review/text: I had high hopes for this coffee.  I sometimes enjoy having a flavored coffee, but I don't generally like the sweetness that comes with the syrups.<br /><br />When I brewed it, it had a very strong, natural vanilla smell, which I really liked.  It made my kitchen smell warm and inviting!<br /><br />The taste, however, is much more subtle.  Perhaps this is because the coffee is strong, and vanilla is a delicate flavor.  I found that most of the vanilla was really coming in through the aroma.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for something that tastes like coffee with syrup in it, this definitely isn't it. However, I think it would get a bit overpowering for my taste if it did, so I'm fine with that.  Just understand what you are getting.<br /><br />Sean P. Logue, 2010

review/text: I am not generally a fan of vanilla-flavored coffee, but this Starbucks Vanilla coffee is pretty tasty! The vanilla isn't overpowering, as it is in some vanilla coffees I've tasted in the past. In fact, one might call the vanilla "subtle." :)<br /><br />I might have preferred a slightly more robust coffee brew, but I can see how such a blend might have overpowered the vanilla flavor.

review/text: I'm a coffee addict, so I normally tend to go for bold dark roast coffees, but the Starbucks French Vanilla Coffee was good. It has a very smooth, silky texture and a good aroma. It has a slightly vanilla taste, and it is delicious with milk and sugar to bring out the vanilla flavor. Highly recommend for anyone who likes to "dress up" their coffee to make it sweet.

review/summary: I like it good coffee not a bad price...  I cut it with the cheap stuff!
review/text: When I got this coffee I did what I normally do with good coffee tried straight black no cream or sugar (which is how I like my coffee) and the stuff was good so good I might just drink it straight no cream or sugar. What I do normally though with good coffee like this is a mix it with some of the cheap stuff that I normally buy. I cut it 50-50 or so. To me it just makes this good copy last longer but that's what I do I bet a coffee snob who reads this will probably have a hemorrhage or something. But that's what I do and I like the taste.<br /><br />One thing I'd like to say I wish that coffee tasted as good as it smells (while this is close) coffee still smells way better than it tastes to me at least. If they tasted as good as it smelled it would be liquid crack!<br /><br />Thanks for reading Hope this helped!

review/summary: Excellent choice
review/text: This has a very strong vanilla flavor. I've tried other vanilla flavored coffees and Starbuck's version is far superior. It does not have the chemical vanilla flavor that is found in other vanilla coffees. This has the flavor of coffee beans and vanilla beans and that is it!<br /><br />One thing: I can't drink this without sugar. For some reason it needs to have at least a little sugar.<br /><br />So when I want vanilla flavored coffee, this is the one I'll reach for. No more searching for the perfect blend without the vanilla extract flavor.<br /><br />Great job Starbucks!

review/text: The vanilla flavor didn't strike me as very vanilla but I liked it ok.  I like to smell the coffee when I open the bag and don't know that I would have thought of vanilla if it hadn't been in the name.  It was a tiny bit bitter for my tastes but definitely a decent cup of coffee.  I don't think I would go out of my way to purchase it after this taste test.<br /><br />I had my daughter try it and she said it reminded her of the vanilla lattes she gets from Starbucks.  She said she would purchase it in the future.

review/text: I am not a big supporter of "flavored" coffee, that is UNTIL  I tried Starbucks' Vanilla Flavored Coffee.  The flavor is very natural tasting and subtle.  In fact, the only coffee that I'm making now is the vanilla flavored coffee....a true believer.  This coffee and the other "flavored" coffees are slightly more expensive than other ground Starbuck coffee.  I noticed they reduced the size of the bag for vanilla  coffee to 11 oz. vs. 12 oz.  for other varieties of coffee.  It is worth every penny it costs!

review/text: Using my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GXZ2GS">Aerobie 80R08 AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a>, this Starbucks vanilla coffee made such a fabulous cup of coffee!<br /><br />The coffee is a light roast with no bitterness (especially when made in the AeroPress), and the vanilla notes are definitely present, but without seeming artificial or overwhelming.  My friend drank it plain black, and thought it was a great cup of coffee.  I make mine with a double-strength coffee base, warmed milk, and raw sugar, a recipe for a little bit of caffeinated heaven.<br /><br />I don't buy flavored coffees very often, but I'll definitely be putting this one into my regular rotation.

review/summary: Very, Very Good With Vanilla Throughout
review/text: I like vanilla as a flavor quite well and it complements this coffee perfectly.  The vanilla flavoring is done very well and is the best aspect to this new flavored coffee.  I like it very strong and without any additions.  You may well obliterate the vanilla by putting in cream and/or sugar.  I like very strong coffee and usually get it by making an even finer grind with the machine in the store but this comes pre-ground and not in whole bean form.  If you want this coffee even stronger, and I may, then find it in the whole bean container instead.  Otherwise, it tastes great.

review/summary: Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee
review/text: I love Starbucks coffee, it's about all I drink. I usually buy the beans at Costco's and grind them myself and that might make a difference. I found this coffee to be a bit too acidic for me and I didn't really taste any vanilla (and I drink black coffee so it's not that cream and sugar hid the flavor). Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was disappointed. I would like to see if they make it in a bean I can grind fresh so I can see if that makes a difference.<br />I will say that I took some of the ground coffee to a friends and she made it and said she liked it. Maybe she was being polite, or maybe she really liked it. I wouldn't buy it ground.

review/summary: Coats the back-of-the-throat like the taste of some awful medicine
review/text: I figured I would give this 11-ounce package of "Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored" a chance to prove my bias against flavored coffees was groundless. The smell of the flavoring--be it real vanilla, imitation vanilla, or something that isn't vanilla at all but smells like someone's idea of vanilla--escapes even from the sealed bag to the point I decided not to keep this coffee near the rest of my stash. After opening the bag, I involuntarily snapped my head away, fearing my olfactory system might be under siege by the sickly sweet smell.<br /><br />Next was to try this coffee, and I admit my courage faltered when I considered what an unadulterated cup of this vanilla flavored coffee might taste like in the morning as I prepared the coffee and set the timer. So I mixed in a good dose of regular coffee, probably three-fifths regular, two-fifths vanilla flavored.<br /><br />Well, first impression is that using the word "natural" to describe this flavor would be a reach until I remembered that just because something does not have an appealing smell does not mean it is not natural and that perhaps these vanilla bean received the same treatment as civet coffee. The coffee seems to burn slightly as it goes down, and tastes overly sweet even without any extra sweetener. I needed that second cup at 6:15 a.m. far more than I wanted it, and I will not be drinking this brew again except as iced coffee and even then, not without cutting it with some regular coffee to help constrain the cloying flavor that coats the back-of-the-throat like the taste of some awful medicine.

review/summary: Very surprised
review/text: Normally I do not like flavored coffee, or Starbucks' coffee. I prefer my coffee to taste like coffee, and come from just about anyplace other than Starbucks. Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Ground Coffee has really surprised me though. It is quite good. The vanilla flavor is very mild and natural tasting. It is not overpowering or overly sweet. As a whole, the coffee is very smooth and I really like it. I would not want to drink it everyday or replace my regular coffee with it, but I enjoyed it, and will definitely drink it in the future when I want a change. The price is not too outrageous either, which is a good change for Starbucks.

review/text: For flavored coffee drinkers, the Starbucks Natural Fusion Vanilla should be a hit.  This coffee has a well rounded taste, is not overly strong, and the emphasis is definitely on the vanilla taste.  I drank this several ways, including with cream and sugar, though it is fine without extra sweetener.  I also "cut" the vanilla with regular medium roast coffee and found the "hint" of vanilla that way more enjoyable than just the full on vanilla alone.  If you like flavored coffees or just want something special every now and then, try this coffee.

review/summary: Dark and muddy, smells like vanilla
review/text: This coffee is finely ground, so it has a good powdery consistency. Typically this means you'll need to use less of it for brewing. My wife and I like strong coffee, but this coffee is very strong, almost to the point that it's muddy.<br /><br />The coffee smells like vanilla, that's not an issue. However, I feel that the coffee blend overpowers the vanilla flavor. The coffee appears to be so darkly-roasted that you taste more coffee than vanilla. This coffee tastes better with milk added, which helps cut through the bitterness of the blend.<br /><br />The bag is typical packaging designed to keep the coffee fresh. Once opened, it can be folded down and sealed with an attached wire clip. The bag is imprinted with a bonus: take the empty bag to a Starbucks, and you get a free "tall" coffee.<br /><br />It's coffee, but not something I would enjoy on a regular basis. This may be a once-a-week blend for me. It's just too strong and lacks a clear vanilla balance.

review/summary: The best flavored coffee ever ... and I hate flavored coffee!
review/text: I accidentally picked up an 11-ounce bag of this coffee because I saw the words "Starbucks" and "ground coffee" and wasn't paying attention to anything else. My wife and I love Starbucks brand coffee but we HATE flavored coffees. All of the flavored coffees we've ever tasted used syrup to add flavor to the coffee beans. As a result, when I drink flavored coffee it tastes like someone poured syrup in my coffee and I hate it.<br /><br />Not so with Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee. The "natural fusions" part of the name is an indication of how Starbucks makes this flavored coffee: they mix ground vanilla beans in with the ground coffee beans! The end result is a flavored coffee that gives you a little "kick" of natural vanilla but doesn't taste like someone poured a bottle of vanilla extract into you coffee.<br /><br />My wife and I love this coffee and we think it makes a great holiday coffee. I will absolutely buy more of this.

review/summary: Reliably good flavored coffee for any occasion
review/text: With the multitude of competing coffees in California, Starbucks coffee seems to be the coffee that people love to hate.  Whatever the reason, many of my coffee drinking friends visibly cringe when I mention the brand name.  I am actually a fan of most of the Starbucks products and the Vanilla Natural Fusion (caffeinated) is a tasty addition to their product line. It is not overpowering in the vanilla department and retains a robust fresh coffee taste.<br /><br />In the interest of objectivity I must mention I am not a coffee aficionado, drinking coffee only twice a day and often using additives such as milk and sugar.  However, I care about the coffee I drink and avoid many brews that tend to be too strong, bitter or headache producing!  It does not need to be refrigerated if used within a reasonable amount of time. This brew is mild and perfect for the casual coffee drinker.

review/summary: Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla With Other Natural Flavors Flavored Ground Coffee
review/text: This coffee really has more of a vanilla scent than a vanilla taste. Adding a little vanilla flavoring to the pot gave it a more satisfying vanilla flavor. I was surprised to see that it is 100% Arabica beans as it is also a little bitter despite being a medium roast.<br /><br />Overall, a decent but not exciting cup of coffee without any chemical or artificial taste that flavored coffees sometimes have.<br /><br />Note that this product is not whole coffee beans but rather is already milled to what is called a "universal grind" which is intended for drip coffee makers.<br /><br />It seems like a long time ago that a pound of coffee was 16 oz. but I suppose that this 11 oz. "one pound" bag is appropriate company for those 64 oz. "five pound" bags of sugar and those 59 oz. "half-gallons" of orange juice that I have been seeing at the grocery store lately.<br /><br />I predict that 10 eggs will be sold as a "dozen" before long.

review/summary: If flavored coffee is your cup of tea, this might be for you
review/text: I've been drinking coffee since I was a kid, and that was back in the 1960s when coffee was coffee, an unpretentious drink whose own flavor, with the addition of cream and sugar, was enough. Now, of course, there's an endless variety of flavored and gourmet coffees for that seemingly upscale crowd for whom a cup of good old Maxwell House would be as unthinkable as wearing their grandfather's hand-me-downs.<br /><br />I'm still a Maxwell House-Folgers-Chock Ful 0' Nuts kind of guy myself, capable of enjoying a coffee from McDonald's more than I could one of Starbucks's syrupy products. Still, I like Starbucks coffee, but more as a change of pace than a habit. The same goes for "flavored" coffees which I consider as unnatural as menthol cigarettes. As flavored coffees go, however, Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee, of which I received a complimentary package, is pretty good. The vanilla flavor is very apparent in both the taste and aroma, and just misses being overwhelming. I enjoyed it, but did not follow it with a second cup, choosing to switch to my usual unflavored brand for that. As previously noted, I enjoy flavored coffee as a novelty, preferring "real" coffee instead.<br /><br />So, I'm giving this product a mild recommendation. I probably won't be buying it myself in the future, but if flavored coffee is your cup of tea, this might be for you.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks

review/summary: Surprisingly good; subtle; sophisticated.
review/text: It's a total cliche and sounds incredibly elitist, but Starbucks' Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee tastes like the grown-up version of nasty flavored coffees from places like Dunkin Donuts and cheap grocery store brands. Maybe it's because I grew up in Seattle and was therefore raised on Starbucks coffee, but I do prefer the more complex flavor of their brews in general and don't find it overly strong or "burnt" as many New England natives - raised with the swell on spout at "Dunks" - do.<br /><br />Not to be too hard on Dunkin; their coffee is certainly "budget friendly"! Actually; the 11oz bags of Starbucks aren't very expensive. In fact, you can get it for the same price, which seems a bit odd to me unless the company plans to raise the price to more traditional "Starbucks prices" after getting people hooked- which seems like a bad idea.<br /><br />As for the coffee, it comes ground, which is great for most people; not if you do cold brew.  The flavor - at least for the vanilla option - was light but it was there; I found myself using one less packet of sweetener than I normally do. The scent is also not overbearing, but pleasant.<br /><br />Overall, I'd buy it. It's good, it tastes better than the competition, and it's available for (essentially) the same price.

Starbucks has come up with a very subtle, natural-tasting vanilla coffee that strikes just the right balance of flavored and rich, dark coffee.  I did not detect an unpleasant aftertaste at all, and enjoyed the change from my regular, unflavored coffee.  I don't expect to be making a switch to always drink this, but as an occasional experience, I give it a thumbs up.

review/text: While there is no doubt that Starbucks Vanilla Fusions Brews a good cup of coffee, I wouldn't claim it's infused with Vanilla flavors. In fact, without additional vanilla creamer, I can't tell the difference between this bag and the ordinary cup of Joe. So if you're looking for the Vanilla flavor right out of the pot, this is not your bag.  But this coffee also claims to be natural and ethically grown, so it does give you something to feel a little better about, just have a little flavored creamer standing by.

review/summary: Not up to par for my tastebuds
review/text: I am one of the biggest Starbucks fans and have tried nearly every blend of coffee bean they have.  While I am not a huge fan of flavored coffees due to the nature of the artificial flavoring they add when Starbucks came out with ALL NATURAL Fusions I was intrigued.<br />I have tried all three blends they offer: cinnamon, vanilla and caramel.<br />Caramel blew me away and I loved it and the description on the bag of vanilla had me guessing it would be the same subtle syrupy sweetly decadent taste that I would like.<br />Not even close.  The vanilla did not impress me at all the while the scent of the coffee smelled heavenly and even my kids remarked on it, the flavor was off putting. The aftertaste made me grimace and I slogged my way through the first cup and offered one to my husband who did not like it either. We poured the rest of the pot out.  I took to to work and brewed a pot and two of my coworkers loved it so to each their own.<br />I would not buy this flavor again or the cinnamon but I have bought multiple bags of the caramel.  I am glad Starbucks is making natural flavored coffees and is a leader in the industry by being the first to do so.

review/text: I was REALLY excited to try this coffee, since I absolutely LOVE vanilla flavored coffee.<br /><br />However, while this brew was decent, I don't think it has much of a vanilla taste at all.  Disappointing.

review/summary: I liked it, but clearly tastes vary!
review/text: I am amazed reading through the reviews of this coffee...everything from strongly artificial vanilla taste to almost no vanilla taste at all.<br /><br />For my part, I almost NEVER make straight flavored coffee...I tend to mix it half and half with an unflavored coffee, just because I like the flavoring to be light. I did make one full strength pot of this and everyone in my family liked it a lot! They all drink it with cream and couple add sugar as well. Every other time I made it, I went half and half with "plain" Starbucks coffee. I didn't find the vanilla taste overpowering *or* non-existent. I thought it was great and very natural. I wonder if some people are comparing the taste of a vanilla coffee drink that actually has vanilla syrup in it, with something like this? I guess I don't know, but I don't know how else to account for such differences in perception.<br /><br />I would buy this again. I do find some vanilla tastes to be unnatural or chemical (think of the feeling you get from a cheap vanilla candle scent) but this coffee was lovely and smooth. To each his own!

review/summary: Liked the smell, not a fan of the taste
review/text: I had high hopes as I opened the bag and started brewing, but after several pots I just don't like the taste. It is too bitter for me, and I don't like the flavors. It doesn't taste like vanilla to me.<br /><br />I enjoyed the aroma though, and would love to be around when those who like it are brewing, but I'll pass on another cup.

review/summary: The COFFEE while FINE, "packed a PUNCH" ...
review/text: I got this coffee for my coffee-addicted husband.  He drinks more coffee than anyone I know.  He loves Starbucks coffee directly from Starbucks, as well as Dunkin Donuts (prepared at home).  He said that he liked the taste of the coffee (although it was more vanilla-y than he normally likes).  He said that he liked that the coffee was strong and "packed a punch", but was a little too fine a texture than he prefers.  Overall, while he does not really like vanilla-flavored coffee, he did like this coffee enough to buy it again.
