review/summary: Great beans at any price
review/text: These beans are a bargain and great quality.  They may seem a little too moist to anyone used to grocery store beans, but they are just fresh and stay that way a very long time in those tubes.

review/summary: great boots!
review/text: bought these for our chihuahua.  They are well made and keep his paws warm and dry.  Securing them properly is somewhat of a challenge.  Often difficult to fasten the velcro tight enough around his leg to keep them from falling off.  Otherwise, excellent product.

review/summary: They stay on!
review/text: I have an 8lb chihuahua who seriously dislikes getting his paws wet or cold.<br />He used to have a pair of "boots" that were purchased from a chain pet store that weren't comfortable and didn't stay on well. They also caused him to really kick while he was walking. Now that's a funny sight, but he couldn't move very quickly.<br /><br />These boots are comfortable, we don't fight to get them onto him, the first time I put them on him I thought there would be an adjustment period - no. He was prancing. PRANCING. The dog who HATES boots, was PRANCING in his new boots.

review/summary: Rockys boots
review/text: I purchased XXXsmall boots for my 6 1/2 pound toy fox terrier and they fit perfect. They were a little tough to get on the first couple of times, but once we got the hang of it, it's easy now. I really didn't think my dog would keep them on, but he does. He prances around as if he were a king. These are very well made and have velcro bands to adjust for the size leg. They look very cute on. Highly recommend them.

review/summary: Really salty, but good.
review/text: The beef jerky was pretty good, I really like the texture and the dryness of it.  I prefer a dry jerky that can be broken apart pretty easily and this was what I got from this jerky.  I had really hoped for more flavor from the meat, being grass fed and high quality, however, all I could taste was salt, and lots of it.  The jerky was extremely salty and that's pretty much all you could taste.<br />I think that perhaps next time I will order one of their other flavors and see if it fares better.<br /><br />Overall good jerky, just a little too salty for my taste.

review/summary: Based on beef being grass fed however . . .
review/text: the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately I'm unable to review the flavor as I forgot I can't have beef anymore (due to health issues).<br /><br />Ingredients:  beef, flavoring supplement (salt, dextrose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, spices, spice extractives, soybean oil), vinegar, brown sugar, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices<br /><br />Here is some info found on the internet:<br /><br />Maltodextrin ~ maltodextrin from corn or soy can be very unsafe/poison for anyone. As all GMO products like corn and soy are genetically engineered from the monsanto company. they insert a bacteria in all GMO products, and this changes the natural organic developing of corn or soy. do not buy anything that contains maltodextrin or titanium for your own health.<br /><br />Maltodextrin made in the US is made from corn.<br />Corn in the US is a GMO food so Maltodextrin as derived from a Gmo is extremely unsafe.<br /><br />Soy ~ this particular info from:<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />. . .fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits. Fermented soy does not wreak havoc on your body like unfermented soy products do.<br /><br />Here is just a sampling of the health effects that have been linked to unfermented soy consumption:<br /><br />*Breast cancer<br />*Brain damage<br />*Infant abnormalities<br />*Thyroid disorders<br />*Kidney stones<br />*Immune system impairment<br />*Severe, potentially fatal food allergies<br />*Impaired fertility<br />*Danger during pregnancy and nursing<br /><br />and for all ~<br /><br />Jesus Christ (Yahushua HaMashiach) is coming back. Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!

We gave each child about 4 oz of these rock candies in a snack size ziploc bag as part of their goodie bag (along with Pop Rocks candies).  The kids loved how realistic the chocolate rocks looked.  The best part is that the kids and parents both said that these rocks tasted wonderful.  We bought a 3 lb bag to divvy up and the nutrition ingredients were on the bag.

I don't care for sweetened tea, but I tried a little non fat dairy creamer in this tea and it brings out a bit of a nutty (hazelnut)flavor. I'm sure the chocolate flavor would be more apparent with sugar added. I was looking for a chocolate flavored tea without mint and this is perfect and delicious!

Saw these in the store on base and picked a bottle up and haven't gone back to the local water since. Smart Water has a very clean taste and these 20oz packs are cheaper on Amazon than on the base. As an added bonus, they're smaller than the 33.8 oz bottles so they're much easier to distinguish when I'm at work and everyrone leaves their water bottles on shared space.

It's very crisp and refreshing when cold and I like the fact that it has electrolytes in the form of calcium chloride, magnesium chloride and potassium bicarbonate.  Would recommend this water to anyone.

review/summary: Best Water
review/text: Does it make me smarter? Nope. Does it taste fantastic ice cold? Yup. I love this water. Why does it taste so much better than other waters? It tastes the way I imagine the polar ice caps taste, the ones that have never seen one atom of pollution,<br />germs, dirt or anything else, just pure hydrogen (two molecules) and oxygen (one molecule).<br />That's what this tastes like. Crisp. And it doesn't hurt, even though it's silly, to imagine as I drink it that I'm getting smarter from that added potassium and magnesium, two minerals we all need more of, especially our brains.<br />I'm sure my brain, being mostly water, appreciates this. Yes it's a brain drink, psychologically at least.<br /><br />Smart Water is purified tap water although the website does say that some plants may use spring water.<br />Every single mineral and chemical that can be in water is removed. Things like arsenic and chromium are not detected in<br />Smart Water once it has gone through it's treatment and filtering process. The website for this states that it<br />is "pure as the first drop of rain". Then the minerals potassium, magnesium and calcium are added to it.<br />These minerals are important to good health and a long life. The website has a long list of solid particulates<br />that can be found in most water, and throughout the list, after the purification process of Smart Water, none<br />with the exception of a tiny amount of flouride can be detected.<br /><br />This intense purification process is what is responsible for the pure clean taste of this water. I was hoping to find out the pH since it is better for health reasons to drink more alkaline water but that was not to be found.<br /><br />I enjoy keeping Smart Water on hand as one of my go to brands of bottled water, along with Fiji and San Pellagrino, the winner as far as mineral content and alkalinity. I avoid drinking tap water as much as possible due to the chlorine it contains, which is a known health risk. This has a remarkably fresh pure taste and the health benefits that a mineral water can provide.  Comment | Permalink

review/summary: Good value but not for the discerning palate
review/text: As mentioned by another reviewer, this did not arrive vacuum packed and I suspect this item may have been older stock.  Grinds into a decent cup of coffee but not one to savor.  Perhaps I am a bit jaded having been recently spoiled with several pounds of rich full bodied coffee beans.<br /><br />I give this the benefit of the doubt and 4-stars.  Although bland, it is drinkable and not overly acidic.  The most important factor for me, is that I got a great price for this.

review/summary: Good to use as treats for dog training!
review/text: While I'm not sure about the nutritional content of this food, I've had very few dogs at the animal shelter near me turn these down as a reward during training.  These are great for training because they are small which allows you to reward the dog a lot without worrying about overfeeding it.  I also like the fact that they don't make your hands greasy or sticky like hot dogs or cheese.  Another plus is that these don't require any preparation, unlike most other dog treats, which need to be cut up into smaller pieces to be the right size for training.<br /><br />It seems that these are a fairly high value treat for most dogs, being on par with or a little better than other soft meaty commercial dog treats and worse than cheese or hot dogs.<br /><br />I don't think I would recommend them as a staple food for dogs, but as a training treat, they are great!

review/summary: Very nice mustard for meats that have been prepared with ginger or raisins.  Your guests will ask you for the secret ingredient!
review/text: It seems today that folks expect mustard to be hot and only served on deli meats.  Well, it is time to explore the OTHER, time-tested ways to enjoy a flavor-intensifying ingredient.  Right up there with balsamic vinegar and fresh thyme, mustard is one of those crucial elements of fine cuisine.  Pommery is recognized by Foodies to be the best mustard on the planet, and Pommery has several variations on their classic "mustard in a crock."  This one uses ginger and other spices to give a more complex foundation to recipes calling for mustard.  I wonder if "mustard macaroons" won't be the next It Food!  Honestly, did you expect to see chocolate-covered bacon, or fennel-dusted chocolates?  Well, be on the leading edge of the wave and load up on Pommery!

review/summary: Nothing like Coffee
review/text: I quit coffee a few weeks ago and really wanted to like this drink.  For people in the same boat, consider yourself warned that this beverage is NOTHING like coffee.<br /><br />As to its merits as a distinct drink, I'd have to say I'm still not a fan.  It's bitter like the previous reviewer has pointed out, but this bitterness is not (in my experience) alleviated by stevia.  While I'm usually a great fan of mint, this drink has a spoiled aftertaste which lingers on the tongue and is interlaced with nutty undertones.  There's not the slightest hint of chocolate, which is a shame because raw cocoa powder would be less bitter than this concoction.<br /><br />If the taste were slightly more obnoxious, I'd say it was medicinal, but as it stands, it might be possible to disguise the poor flavors using cream or sugar.  However, I think I'll just save my money and continue on my search for a coffee alternative which I actually enjoy drinking.<br /><br />This isn't to write Teeccino as a brand off; I'd suggest ordering the sampler pack from their website in order to make an informed decision rather than pin all your hopes and dreams to one large tub of a single flavor.

review/text: I had to stop drinking coffee a year ago, and this stuff is a life saver. Don't expect anything that isn't coffee to taste like coffee, but this is the closest thing out there. I drink it by the potful every morning. Chocolate mint is my favorite of all the Teeccino flavors, and I've tried all of them. It's rich, dark, not too chocolaty, and the mint flavor helps me wake up. It tastes good with or without cream. I've experienced no physical side effects drinking this, unlike with coffee and black, green, and white teas.

review/summary: take a slow transition
review/text: As some other reviewers mentioned, it does not necessarily work for everyone as a coffee substitute. I've had teeccino for 2 weeks now and must acknowledge that it was hard in the beginning. BUT as soon as I followed a recommendation on a teeccino can - mixing teeccino with real coffee first and then gradually reducing the coffee ratio - I was being able to enjoy the drink AND I felt so much better - no after-coffee syndrome any more. I am still mixing in 1 tsp of coffee or less to 1 full scoop of teeccino, for the taste,  at the same time I am getting used to the new taste. I also mix in with non-dairy milks - rice, coconut or almond - coconut works the best for me, although a brand matters. I highly recommend to follow the instruction on the package - makes all the difference for coffee addicts - to slow down the transition from real coffee to a substitute. A taste of teeccino is great on its own - great job of its maker, it just does not feel right for a coffee addict. Give yourself time for your taste buds to adjust, and you'll start enjoying the teeccino as well. Also experiment with a coffee maker and non-dairy milks.

review/summary: awesome on so many levels!
review/text: Both the chocolate and cinnamon Sweet Crisps are a wonderful sweet crunchy treat.  they pack a punch of flavor and if you're specifically trying to satisfy a chocolate craving, they'll do the trick. (my advice: eat them with the chocolate side down against your tongue).  What I specifically like about them is that they have some fiber but not a lot like some "diet" snacks so if you chose to eat the whole bag (which I admit to doing!  only about 400 calories which for a dessert is NOT BAD, baby!  better than an ice cream sundae or chocolate bar!) you don't run the risk of tummy troubles due to a huge influx of fiber.<br /><br />Also, my 3 year old picky eater daughter loves these and they have enough protein in them that I am happy to occasionally give them to her to help reach her proper nutrition levels for the day.  A much better option in that regard than most other types of cracker/bread/cereal items that kids are known to favor and usually have little to no protein.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Very tasty, but check expiration date
review/text: I really like these crackers! They are crisp and very flavorful, and much better for you than most crackers which are loaded with hydrogenated oils. You can eat 15 crackers for only 130 calories and 2.5 grams of fat (no sat fat); and they are wheat-free. My 6- and 8-year old boys even love these! The only problem is they have a shorter shelf life than some crackers (which is probably due to no hydrogenated oils). According to the manufacturer they have a 210 day shelf life (~7 months). Unfortunately, by the time I received my case of crackers there was only three months left. If I buy a case of any boxed/canned product, I expect at least a 6-month shelf life (by the time I receive the product). Amazon graciously refunded my entire purchase price and will look into a method of insuring a fresher product or at least informing the consumer of the expiration.

review/text: I love this hot sauce.  Most sauces as hot as this one do not have good flavor.  This one has a very nice taste, I use it on all kinds of things (It is thick, like bbq- but only use a drop!!). My favorite use is on dry roasted peanuts.  I put a drop in about 1/4 cup of nuts.  I put it in something with a lid and shake to coat.  Delicious and addicting!  It is seriously hot though.  Not one of my friends can eat it cheerfully.  If you think Tabasco sauce is hot, if you think jalepenos are hot, this is not for you.<br /><br />Keep it away from your kids and away from your eyes.

review/summary: My Sauce of Choice!
review/text: Simply put, this has become my basic table sauce for nearly every situation. It is way too hot for the general public, but for us pepperheads, it has great taste (sort of a steak sauce flavor), and massive (yet controlled) heat. It has a back-heat that builds over several minutes, which gives time for the flavor to be savored. A couple of drops mashed into a baked potato, spinkled onto scrambled eggs, or spread over a slab-o-roast beast yields the full range of taste pleasure and pain. It only leaves me wanting more. My only suggestion to the consumer is to replace the cap that comes on the bottle with one of the dropper-type ones from an old empty bottle of Liquid Smoke; the threads match, and the tongue you save may be your own.

review/text: This sauce has a nice and sweet bbq flavor that is an interesting new twist. I'm looking forward to trying it with some fish, or maybe sushi. The ingredients caught my eye immediately and I knew I'd be trying this one day, but what sealed the deal was the 1,000,000 SU rating in the product description. Don't get me wrong, it's still very hot, but it doesn't compare to Satan's Blood or Mad Dog 357 Silver (800,000 and 750,000 S.U. respectively). In the end it's got a solid flavor and enough heat to join alongside Blair's After Death as my go-to sauces.

review/summary: not remarkably hot or tasty
review/text: This sauce, like many extract sauces (predator sauce is another), has a more acrid flavor that really detracts from the taste. There are superhot sauces like blair's possible side effects that have no extract, instead using red savinas or similar super-hot peppers. That said, the scoville count on this sauce is 90k according to web searches, whereas possible side effects, a no extract sauce, is 280k.<br /><br />So, if you're just looking for a bottle of super-hot stuff to giggle at and threaten coworkers with, you can go ahead and get this, but there's hotter stuff out there. If you actually care about the flavor, do yourself a favor and pass over this, there's better stuff above it and below it on the scoville scale.

review/text: I learned of these from my construction worker son who is given them on the job in this brutal hot weather. They are passed out to all electricians on his job to try to prevent heat exhaustion and stroke. They work wonderfully. My daughter has a digestive tract problem and requires daily intake of enhanced drinks like gatoraid, and poweraid. These "Sqwinchers" are infinately better, have more electrolytes, potassium, less sodium, and taste a lot better to her. She finds she can tell if she doesn't get enough of them everyday so I try to keep them on hand and frozen. One suggestion I would make is to sell them by the flavors so we could buy what we want and not have to waste some of the sqwenchers. Please consider doing this.

review/summary: Excellent Quality With Some Holiday Flavor...
review/text: This Amoretti premium syrup pack contains 3 bottles with Christmas themed flavors:  Peppermint, Eggnog and Gingerbread.  The bottles are 50ml (1.7 oz) and each provide about 6 servings per use making the total pack good for about 18 uses.<br /><br />This pack was brought to go along side with a milk frothing machine I purchased for my mother to make espresso and whipped cream with.  Each syrup is exceptional quality and imparts a nice subtle flavor into the milk/cream.  Despite being syrups, it doesn't overpower you with sugar.  Instead you get a bit of flavoring added into the drink or milk/cream froth which pairs especially well with coffee (since it doesn't overpower the natural flavor of the coffee).  While all three are delicious, Gingerbread happens to be my personal favorite while Peppermint is my mother's.<br /><br />These make a perfect gift for someone who loves to make their own milk foam / cream, or even to add a bit of Christmas flavor to other drinks.  It also makes for a good sample pack to test out the quality of Amoretti Syrups; And I find the quality to be exceptional.  Don't be put off by the small bottles either.  While you only get 50ml (1.7 oz) for each flavor, you don't need much of the syrup to get some nice subtle flavor.

review/text: All three of these syrups are absolutely delicious in coffee and cocoa. Just be aware that they are stocking stuffer-sized, as is stated in the description.  It's a good way to try the flavors and see which one you like. I'm adoring the peppermint syrup in cocoa - very minty and not too sweet.  The eggnog flavor makes a wonderful, light eggnog simply mixed with whole milk and either rum or brandy, minus many of the calories.  A splash of the gingerbread syrup in chai tea boosts the flavor and adds a touch of sweetness.

I do not have to eat gluten free but I try many GF things because I have a handful of family memebers that do and I am always excited to find new things to try.  These have no gritty or other odd texture that sometimes accompanies GF products, just crunchy cheese flavor!  These have 20%  calcium and 4 grams of protein per serving...how great is that (although there is a little saturated fat because it is made with over 40% real cheese).  I will be buying these for snacks for myself and for my GF family as well.  I can't wait to try the other cheese ups flavors and even the crackers (all GF).  I wish they would sell a variety pack to easily let us try all of them!!!  And they are a bit pricey but well worth it for a nice change of pace, especially for the GF crowd!

review/text: I really, really do not like this gum. It might be gluten free and "natural", but it tastes disgusting. The peppermint flavor only seems to be in the outer candy shell of the gum. So you chew and break the shell, then swallow that part and then the taste is gone. The taste only lasts about the time it takes to chew up a Tic Tac and swallow it and doesn't leave the pleasant aftertaste a Tic Tac does. Then after that candy shell is gone, to me at least, it tastes like chewing on a wood chip and is almost as hard. I can't stand chewing it even as long as minute. I think I might get more out of chewing on ice. Sorry, I really tried to like this, but I'm taking a pass on this brand of gum.
