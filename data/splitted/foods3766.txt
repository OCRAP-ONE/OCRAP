review/text: This tea smells amazing when you open the bag--that's almost the best part!  However, it's advertised as "flavored black tea"--but no matter how much I steep it, it doesn't get very dark or robust.  It's been good for inflammation!

review/summary: great price on varity pack fruit snacks.
review/text: For mom's on a budget, this is a nice sized package of variety fruit snacks for a great price. The kids always fight over the gushers, which leaves me more fruit by the foot to eat. The kids can have the neon colored fruit by the foot and roll ups snacks while I hide the strawberry fruit by the foot and roll ups for myself. Worth the buy and no running to the store while they are on sale hoping there are some left.

review/summary: no rolls please
review/text: I love the way they all taste but, fruit roll up has got to be the most annoying fruity snack on the planet. Why do they roll it up? Can't they just leave it as a flat sheet, and place another sheet on top? Do you know how long it takes to unroll it? Only to have teeth snatching it up as soon as it's been freed from that plastic roll-up prison. The unrolling takes longer than the eating. I'd like to just get to the eating part thanks. Oh, and there's way more roll-ups than any of the other snacks in the package. You know, the more fun snacks.

review/summary: Revolting
review/text: I remember when fruit rollups first came out--they looked and tasted like actual fruit.  This product in its present form certainly does neither now.  I bought 3 boxes, thinking it would be a good after-school snack.  After one try, all three boxes were thrown away, two unopened.  It may be true that there are still products out there that withstand the test of time and the all-mighty buck.  Alas, this is most certainly not to be one of them.

review/summary: Not so good.
review/text: Normally I would agree with the other two reviewers, these are a very good treat.  This bag came well packaged but the candy itself was smashed and it had gone through several temperature changes and now had a grey dusting on the crushed outer shell.  So the damage had to happen before it left Amazon.  It would seem that Amazon does not know that chocolate has to be stored at a cool temperature that does not get overly warm or overly cold.  Normally I would shrug my shoulders and continue to eat them, but the handling of this package has somehow changed the taste of the dark chocolate and the peppermint filling.  One more item from Amazon, shipped by Amazon, that should not of gone out the door in the condition it was shipped, but of course to pay to ship their mistake back, will cost more then it is worth, around $6.00 to ship back a $19.00 product.

review/summary: Honestly the best jam I've ever tasted
review/text: I originally bought this because I was looking for a low-sugar, all-fruit spread option for the morning toast that didn't involve any artificial colors or sweeteners.  What I ended up finding was the best jam ever!  The apricot flavor is prominent, with large chunks of fruit and a nicely textured "jelly" surrounding it.  It's sweet without being cloying, and a little tangy.  It definitely satisfies a sweet tooth in a way that the no-sugar (read: asparteme sweetened) jams never could.  Please do note, however, that there is sweetener in the form of grape juice concentrate.  It is technically "all-fruit", but some of that fruit is sugary juice concentrate.  Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase and plan on stocking up!

review/summary: Great, if you like CARDBOARD
review/text: Okay, so the box sat on my counter for 2 months while I tried to find the time to make this product-- since it's not a quick thing to make pastries from scratch. I was going to feature this product on my blog--where I often give tips on healthy desserts, pet help & relationships. It's the holidays and I finally decided to make the time.  I got out my camera to chronicle this event and gave this my best efforts. Unfortunately, I just wasted 3 hours and lots of efforts on what turned out to be CARDBOARD.<br /><br />First, the company is in Australia, I believe, and assumes that we already know what to do. The directions were minimal and it didn't even give baking instructions--once the pastry was prepared.  It was very difficult and time consuming and the end result was YUCK.  There were many naughty words heard from the direction of the kitchen--and more accurately, my lips.  My husband and handyman were laughing-- right along with me--as I forced them to try them out.  Big thumbs down.<br /><br />* I'm sure a PASTRY CHEF or someone who does this all of the time--might have tips--but for the above average--gluten free baker--I would say, SKIP IT and find something else. I have made a LOT of gluten free products & even developed some recipes on my own--- but never had these kind of issues.<br /><br />I called Amazon and got a refund, they were wonderful and understanding and refunded my purchase. Hope this helps--Happy Healthier Baking!  :-)

review/summary: This is my number one coffee
review/text: I have been drinking coffee, without cream or sugar, for about forty years. I purchase whole bean and grind and brew it fresh. This is a 'blend' so do not expect 100% Jamaican Blue. Last year, I did buy some 100% Jamaican Blue coffee beans at $35/pound. To be honest, I did not really care for the 100% Blue. Maybe the cost affected my taste buds. It is hard to describe taste. To me, this blend is mild and full of flavor as compared to many others. In the past year, I have gone through about fifty pounds of this and still enjoy it.<br /><br />I sometimes like to experiment with different types of coffee beans. The other beans by Magnum, that have comparable types in the local markets, have all been superior in flavor and similar in price to the available local brands. I would highly recommend any of the 'Magnum Coffee' types of coffee. This one is just my overall favorite.<br /><br />Ken

review/text: I *really* wanted to like this coffee, because it sounded great on paper, and had a slew of good reviews. However, my taste buds say different: this coffee's burnt. It's dark, oily, and bitter. On top of that, it also tastes extremely weak, no matter how high of a coffee to water ratio is used. You would hands down get a better cup using Starbucks from the grocery store (a better value for your money). The only redeeming quality I can see so far is the product packaging (+1 star), which is very attractive and lively. Verdict on Magnum Jamaican Blue Mountain Blend: ugh, don't bother.

The smell is a bit more pungent and accidic but, the taste is still smooth and rich without burning your stomach. For the price it is a good option to tide yourself over until you can make it back to the island. IF you want the REAL DEAL by the kind on the brown sack but 9 times out of 10 by the time it arrives to you and you pay for shipping the beans will be so DRY you should have spent the same amount of money on a trip to Jamaica. So this is a good choice! I recommend it for those wanting something to quench their craving enough until they the time and money to get the real thing. It's GOOD!

review/text: I just got this in the mail today.  I ordered it two days ago and it qualified for prime shipping.  today I went back thinking I would order some more and it's no longer Prime and the shipping is $11, so forget it.  It is delicious but not at that price.  I'm going to try another brand.  If you don't mind about $22 a jar go for it because it is really good.

review/summary: A mess delivered and not what promised
review/text: This was a present for my Mom for Christmas.  Although we were at first happy because it showed up before Christmas when it said that it would be after, we were very disappointed on what was delivered.  My Mom said that the dirt was all over, even though it was shrink wrapped.  When she found the fisherman, she said it was so small that she didn't know what it was at first.  He was not holding a fishing pole, and she couldn't figure out where he went since she found him hidden in the dirt.  She had to balance the tree against the rocks, otherwise it would fall over.  On a positive note, the seller was quick to respond for our refund.

review/summary: Great price - Great Product
review/text: I recently purchased 2 of these little Zen Bonsai trees.. They showed up very quickly and in great shape... I got two different versions which was nice.. One had a lantern, the other a white crane (bird).. Note that these little guys require quite a bit of attention.. I didn't realize that they needed to be submerged under water for a few minutes ever 2-4 days... Not that I mind it, but I was expecting something that required a little less attention.. When I leave town, my neighbor has to feed the cats, fish, and dunk my Bonsai in water... lol.. but they are very pretty, and are quite peaceful.. My lady and I each have one on our home office desk.. and they add that something special to the vibe of our office.. If I had it to do all over, I would certainly buy this product again.. and will recommend it to my friends and family if they want one of their own..

review/summary: Sizes vary
review/text: Sizes of pots and trees may vary.  Mine looks like the pictures with notes uploaded by another Amazon member.  This means that my item's ceramic pot is 6" long and 4" wide, which is much smaller than what is in product description, and does not have the miniature bridge.  My juniper tree is 5" tall, which is also shorter than minimum height described in product description.<br /><br />I contacted the seller regarding such discrepancies and was partially refunded.  Seller was nice and refunded quickly.  Price is already a steal and my tree is healthy, so I decide to keep it.<br /><br />It arrived well-packaged and on time.

review/summary: A classic tree for a beginner
review/text: This little juniper tree provides a great starting point for trying your hand at Bonsai as a hobby.  The pot and tree arrived wrapped in a plastic bag then stuffed into a box with foam peanuts.  Everything was in great shape.  If your fisherman is missing his fishing pole look for a crude looking toothpick as you unwrap the tree.  This is the fishing pole.  After rising the loose dirt out of the man's hand I was able to delicately push the pole into his grip.  It knocks loose at times, but is easy to put back.  It could be glued or pasted in, but that might cause problems down the road as it gets bumped.  So for now I'm content to just fix it when it gets knocked out.  The bird was a bit beat up (paint marring).  But it gives the whole setup a nice weathered look.  This keeps it from looking too factory finished.  You'll need to purchase some bonsai tools for the tree.  I purchased the kit found on this site that came with the pruners, bamboo brush, and broom rake.  Also you'll need to get some training wire.  The tree as it arrived was parked squarely on top of the fisherman.  After a month of training wire, it is trained off of him and the rocks.<br /><br />In the end, buy this little tree and you'll be pleased with the purchase.  It's a hobby that requires patience.  And remember, that any scratches, dings, or bumps carry with them a story unique to you.  So instead of getting upset, think of any little damage you do as a unique part of your experience with the tree.  Have fun.

Juicy pear came along and that was my favorite for about ten years.  I thought nothing would top it, ever.  Then I tried red apple.  It is sweet and tart and really delicious, my new favorite flavor.  A ten pound box is surprisingly tempting and I am sorry they are currently all sold out.

review/summary: A Surprising Blend of Bean and Apple
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect from this Jelly Belly flavor. I have eaten "red apples" before but they were usually in a fruit. This was a candied bean with "red apple" flavors put inside. Despite the obvious witchcrafts, I tried this confection because I am not afraid of the unknown like so many people in the RELIGIOUS RIGHT (WRONG). I was surprised to find that this "red apple" had a delicious apple-like flavor and a chew not unlike a finely prepared hamsteak. Would I eat more of these? Yes, I would. I would also recommend this "red apple" to anybody who is adventurous and wants to experience a new and exciting way to feel the best parts of the fruit eating process. RED APPLE JELLY BEANS, THEY DO TASTE LIKE APPLES KIND OF BUT NOT COMPLETELY. STILL PRETTY GOOD.

review/summary: Quick and apparently yummy toy
review/text: If it lasted, it would be a good chew.  It's a little smelly but compared to a chew-hoof it's Chanel.  Puppy took it from my hand and went straight to work, and it lasted about 20 minutes.  He's a bigger chewer now but at the time he was not the most ferocious, and it would last maybe 8 minutes now.  No mess on the floor - little nibbled bits that stick to your socks - like you get with real bones.  No loose stool either, but there were some FUNKY smells going on in his vicinity a few hours after each bone.<br /><br />For a more durable chew without the stinkies, try an antler.  I'll post a review on those if I can find them in my order history.<br /><br />Based on the dogs I've owned, this would be great for a Sheltie, spaniel, bichon or other small- to midsize- puppy that isn't a serious chewer but needs a job to do to keep him out of trouble.

review/text: I bought these bones for my adult dog and a couple of young teething puppies I was fostering.  My adult dog was able to devour these things in no time (I eventually got him the larger sized bones so it would at least last him a good minute instead of seconds).  The puppies loved to chew on these things and were determined to eat them as fast as they could.  When one puppy managed to finish, she would go after her sister's if she still had some left.  These things actually smell good enough that you might almost want to eat one.  haha  They don't last too long but they are a good treat for a dog, especially one who is teething.  They still don't last more than 5 minutes but if you want to spoil your dog, this is a good way to do it.

These are perfect because I can open one package and have one bone for each dog.  They love these and sit waiting for them.  They are not soft but not like rawhide so when they chew on them, it helps clean their teeth.  There are enough vitamins and flavor to keep them interested until the whole bone is gone.  I would definitely buy again.

review/summary: Dog loved it, until his first bowel movement.
review/text: I am a big fan of treats that are digestable.  I purchased this product thinking it would be safe to feed my dog.  I left the treat for my dog on my way out the door for work, when I arrived home 4 hours later the treat was fully gone and the poor dog could not control his bowel movements and had diarrhea.<br /><br />This diarreha lasted for 2 days, and was so bad that I had to take a trip to the vet which ended up being one of the most expensive trips I've made there yet to have him tested for various illnesses.<br /><br />I didn't attribute the diarrhea to the product at first, but a week later I again gave my dog this bone treat and a few hours after eating the bone the diarrhea started back up again.<br /><br />I'm unsure what exactly about this product is "healthy", and would argue against it being "edible".  Sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it won't require surgery to remove.  But you'll spend 2-3 days dealing with uncontrolable doggy bowel movements, and excessive dehydration.  And if your not quick enough to realize it's this treat causing your problems you'll spend a few hundred bucks at the vets office like I did.<br /><br />And don't get me started on how quickly these things can get eaten....<br /><br />From now on I'll stick with bully sticks.

review/summary: does the job
review/text: For the price, it would be nice if these bones lasted longer, but they do their job so I'm not complaining. I spoke to someone at a pet supply store who recommended these as an alternative to rawhide chews, and he said they're fully digestible, while being good for dogs' teeth and gums. My dog (a 30lb beagle/coonhound) LOVES the bacon flavor, and it keeps him occupied for a little while (probably about a half hour). At this rate, these are a little more expensive than rawhides, and serve the same function, but are safer for your dog, since they are more easily digestible than rawhide. Ultimately, these bones are a pretty nice treat for my dog, but I'll also be looking for some longer-lasting chews to keep him occupied for longer periods.

review/summary: Doggies love 'em
review/text: Since I have been seeing so many recalls not only on dog food but treats, I decided to look for something that is made in this country and found these.  My two Pom's love them and it is their morning treat.  They won't let forget to give them to them as they make sure they stare me down till I do. lol  They can be eaten without any worry of anything happening to them as they don't contain plastic or any other foreign material. Unless I find a bad review or hear that there is a recall on these, hope there isn't, I will continue to buy these Edibles.  My boys like the bacon flavor the best out of all the different flavors offered.  Amazon also offers a really good price on these.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: My dog is being treated for a condition that requires me to reduce her exercise level to almost nothing.  I'm desperately trying to find treats that will keep her quiet and aren't rawhide.  The vet told me I shouldn't give me dog rawhide on a daily basis, so I decided to try these edible Nylabones.<br /><br />My dog loved how these tasted, but she finished them in a matter of minutes.  The description calls these "edible chews," so I was expecting these bones to keep my dog occupied.  I wouldn't call these bones "chewy" either.  They seem to be slightly tougher than a Milkbone, but just as dry.  I have been a fan of Nylabone products for as long as I can remember.  I raised all my puppies with Nylabones, but these edible Nylabones don't last long enough.<br /><br />On the plus side, my dog did enjoy these treats and they didn't give her an upset stomach (she has a pretty tough stomach though).

review/text: My dog loves these.  A little pricey, but can be broken into 2 or 3 smaller treats.  My boxer boy has a sensitive stomach, and these have never given him any "digestive" (read "gas" or "the runs") problems, although I limit him to just a third of a bone a day.  May not be the healthiest, as one reviewer said, but seems to make my dogs limited life happier.  Not to mention, most real bacon is loaded with salt, chemicals, and saturated fat...not too healthy either!

review/summary: Read the fine print
review/text: We bought the multi-pack that comes with the standard non-edible nylabones. After 3 minutes of our puppy chewing on this "edible" bone, we got concerned that he had bitten off a chunk of it. To our relief, the bone is technically "edible", but the fine print says for puppies 6 months and older. To me, that's a little misleading. I'd consider a puppy under 6 months old.<br /><br />Our dog passed the 1-inch chunk he'd eaten, but it was his first soft stool in the 6 weeks we've had him. The rest of the bone found its way into the garbage. Nylabone should reconsider selling a multi-pack of these bones mixed with the non-edible style. We were ultra-concerned when handing him a bone that he managed to eat assuming it was the same as the others.<br /><br />My advice, steer clear of these "healthy" edible Nylabones.

review/text: My 60-lb lab mix loved this bone (the large size)! I like that it doesn't leave a nasty mess all over the floor and didn't give Hobbes any gas or stool problems. But I bought it thinking that it would last awhile, since its large and feels hard, but he finished it in 5 minutes flat. Not very cost effective, since they are pretty expensive and don't last long, but I will reiterate that my dog absolutely loved it.

review/summary: Very disappointing if you have previously used the plastic Nylabones.
review/text: My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, "natural," flavored bones and thought.... "SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great.

review/summary: This is one of the best dry dog foods you can buy
review/text: This is an outstanding dry dog food. High in protein(42%) and low in carbohydrates. Contains no grain fillers like corn, barley, wheat, or rice. It's pricey, but you're getting a far superior product. The major carbohydrate source is potatoes, which are also a good source of B vitamins and other minerals. There is a good range of fruits/vegetables in the food, whole eggs and a good range of probiotics. The product does not contain animal fat, but instead sunflower and herring oils which are excellent sources of Omega 3/6 EFAs.<br /><br />This food is outstanding in that it contains no grains whatsoever. Grains are not a natural part of a canine diet and it is pleasing to see dog foods on the market that exclude grains completely from the diet. This is a far more natural food concept and combined with a complete lack of any low quality or controversial ingredients is the reason this food is placed in a class above the more conventional form dry dog foods.

review/summary: Superior food, excellent value
review/text: I am on Amazon to buy more of this brand after we bought a small package locally (about $35) to try it out before ordering online.  It is a fabulous dog food that will not only keep your dog's digestive system in great shape (and all you dog owners know what I mean -- less poop, with a solid consistency), but also will cost virtually the same as a cheaper brand, because your dog will need to eat so much less of this good lean protein.  We have a 70-lb. lab and I am estimating he will go through one of the $35 bags of small bites per month.  Not to mention the cost savings and peace of mind in having a healthier dog with fewer vet visits.  If you haven't already done so, read all the analyses and reviews on [...] plus their Info and FAQs sections to educate yourself about dog food.  You will never again buy dog food from the grocery store (pure junk!!)or from most vets (used to be good but formulas have been cheapened and changed and they are now mostly junk too!) For now, Innova Evo is one of several outstanding brands but you must constantly read labels because even good foods change.

review/summary: Expensive but not as expensive as you think.
review/text: The price per bag is more expensive but you feed your dog much less because there is no grain in the food. Therefore, the price per day is much less than common middle of the road dog foods like science diet. Here is how I figured it out:<br /><br />My dog:<br />40 lb. Border collie, 4 years old, energetic and healthy, been fed Evo his entire life<br /><br />Food serving size per day based on manufacturers recommendations:<br />According to Science Diet - 3 cups or 295 grams per day.<br />Evo - 1 7/8 cups or 226 grams per day.<br /><br />Cost:<br />Science Diet Adult Fitness: $44.39 / 35 lb. bag or 15,875.73 grams.<br />Evo Red Meat Small Bites: $ 61.99 / 28.6 lb. bag or 12,972.74 grams.<br /><br />At the recommended serving size each bag of dog food will last for:<br />(Grams per bag / daily serving size)<br />Science Diet - 53.8 days.<br />Evo - 57.4 days.<br /><br />Cost per day to feed dog.<br />(Bag of food cost / total number of days a bag of food will last)<br />Evo Daily Cost - $0.93 per day.<br />Science Diet - $1.21 per day.<br /><br />Evo representatives have recommended switching between the salmon, chicken. My dog likes all of them it just makes sense because humans are not supposed to eat the exact same thing every day either.<br /><br />Pros:<br />My dog is healthy<br />Has no allergies to any ingredients (has allergies to other things like pollen)<br />He like the taste of all three types of Evo food. (salmon, chicken, red meat)<br />Not overweight<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can't think of any other than his poop smells awful... I assume from the protein.

review/summary: GREAT FOR ALLERGIES & NOT AS EXPENSIVE AS YOU THINK!
review/text: I have a Jack Russell Terrier that is SUPER ALLERGIC to grains.  I've had her on EVO <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTJQN2">EVO Red Meat Small Bite Dry Dog Food</a> & the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M2L23M">Evo Herring and Salmon Dry Dog Food 6.6lb</a> For well over a year now.  I used to have to give her steroids every spring & fall. (Which I HATED to do!)  Her itching was so bad, that it kept ME awake at night!  I researched all kinds of dog food & dog food information I could get my hands on.  (I'm a Certified Dog Trainer & used to work as a Vet Tech, so I have a pretty good knowledge dog food knowledge base).  I found this book; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1929242670">Unlocking the Canine Ancestral Diet: Healthier Dog Food the ABC Way</a>, which is an EXCELLENT BOOK!  After reading it, I thought about making my own dog food, but decided it was not reasonable for me to do that, time wise.  The book has a list of recommend dog foods & I decided on EVO.  I'm SO GLAD I DID!!  SO IS MY DOG!!  It is now July 2012.  They've (I have 2 Jack Russell 'Terrorists', but only one with allergies) been on the EVO dry dog food diet for almost 2 years & I have NEVER had any issues with loose stools, the dogs not wanting to eat the food, etc.  In fact, the dog I have with the allergies is a 'picky' eater, but she LOVES EVO!  Especially the Herring & Salmon flavor.  Since I've been feeding this food, I've noticed that my other JRT has developed an ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL coat!  (I have one roughy & one smooth coat)  The smooth coat with the amazingly beautiful coat is due to the EVO.  It's even helped with the amount of shedding!  (Nothing can totally eliminate shedding, but this has cut down on the amount of shedding enough that I have noticed a difference!  I'm thinking that Josh Crick, got a bad bag OR, what I think is more likely, is was past the expiration date.  Also, (as you will find out if you read the book I recommended, which is just a thin little paperback, packed with info!)  You should NEVER take your dry dog food out of the original bag & store it in one of those bins.  Anything that can't be used up in 2 weeks time, I keep in the freezer.  This keeps the DHA in the food from breaking down & keeps dust mites & other little critters (that we can't even see) out of the food.  I CAN'T STRESS HIGHLY ENOUGH, that the expiration date, proper storage & just plain taking good care of the dogs food & plain old common sense, IS SO VERY IMPORTANT!  PLEASE read that book!  It's AWESOME & even has recipes in there so you can make your own dog food.  Also, reviewer Josh Crick stated that 1/4 of the bag he bought was powder, raises a HUGE red flag for me.  There has to be something either in that bag or something else wrong!!<br />About the price, everyone considers this dog food expensive, but with no fillers in it & depending on your dog's activity level, it takes a LOT LESS for the dog to get the nutrients he/she needs.  So you may pay more upfront when you first buy this, but if you store it properly, it will last much longer, because you feed so much less.  My smallest JRT is 15 lbs.  She is pretty active.  Living in Michigan's Upper Peninsula & only a mile from the northern part of Lake Michigan, I take the dogs to the beach to swim & they get to run loose in the woods, chasing all kinds of small mamamals, (yes, including skunks!), she only requires about 1/3 of a cup of food each day.  In fact, I have to watch her, because she tends to get a little 'chunky' now & then.  Personally, I think that this food is actually cheaper when all is said & done.<br />I hope this review helps!  I'll be monitoring this, so please feel free to ask any questions!!

Ok, now that you took my reciept how do I do that? The customer service for Evo was unhelpful and was not able to help my situation. Apparently it is not a true satisfaction guarantee.

review/text: We purchased a large bag of these at our local Costco, but they sell out so fast - Costco can't keep them in stock! They are absolutely fantastic chips. Very thin and crispy with just the right blend of spices. Our entire extended family loves them!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003RR6AWK">Boulder Canyon Rice & Adzuki Bean Snack Chip, Chipotle Cheese, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: This coffee is a great medium roast coffee. We really like the Camano Island coffees not only for a great taste but also a resonable price for organic coffee.

review/summary: Unnatural flavor
review/text: Unfortunately these flavorings, like most, do not have a natural taste. Perhaps my taste buds are more discerning than some, but I just can't find flavorings that taste good. The price was not bad for the set for someone who will actually use it.

review/summary: One of my favorite
review/text: The other review was really surprising to me.  I absolutely love this cereal, it is not mealy but chunky and full of flavor, not to mention that it is all natural and does not use gmo grain or preservatives like commercial cereals.  I highly recommend you try this cereal, and with subscribe and save it's much cheaper than buying it at the grocery store.
