review/summary: Elderberry "not for retail sale" package
review/text: These are mislabeled. They are 48oz. 'not for retail sale' resealable (slider zip) bags of Ocean Spray sweetened dried cranberries with elderberry juice concentrate. They are not boxes. NOTE: The ingredients say they have elderberry juice concentrate for coloring. I do not have a regular retail package here to compare and wonder if all use elderberry juice for coloring and do not prominently label it on the front.<br /><br />As others said, these are great for trail mix, in cereal, plain as a snack, in muffins, etc.

review/text: When I saw how much cheaper these were than Traverse Bay I decided to check them out. They appear to be the same as Craisins found in store which I find to be too sugary in both taste and touch. I like Traverse Bay as they taste to me to have the fruit, not just skin and juice. Eden is not bad but smaller size fruit.<br /><br />[...]

review/text: We use these cranberries in a lot of our baked items. These taste better that the ones we buy locally. The price is about the same with free shipping from Amazon. With the taste being better, we'll be using these instead of local purchases. We have also used these to make a cranberry jam type sauce as a topping for ice cream & waffles. These also work very well in homemade trail mixes.

review/summary: Thought I was "over" coconut water!
review/text: I thought I had od'ed on coconut water and had had enough...UNTIL I opened a can of Zola's coconut water. I liked coconut water for a while, then had to switch to flavored coconut waters because I was not liking the taste. Upon first glance, I thought, "Geez, this can is huge- no way am I going to drink all of this in one sitting." And then I looked, eh, "plain", no crazy mango or kiwi flavor trying to spruce up some bland coconut water. I popped that can open, took a swig and WOW! I had to look at the ingredients again thinking, "there must sugar or some artificial sweetener or flavor in this stuff" But NOPE! Just 100% pure coconut water! It was delicious! Very clean natural taste, just the right amount of "nut" flavor, no tin can taste, nice and sweet without being syrupy and left no sweet "residue" in my mouth.<br />Much to my surprise, I drank the entire can in one sitting. And am looking forward to my next....<br />If you like coconut water- totally buy this stuff....and even if you don't, buy it anyway and give it a try. It's yummy.

review/summary: Best coconut water ever, without a doubt!
review/text: I tend to not believe the catchy phrases in the ads and was skeptical when I read "Drinking Zola 100% Pure Coconut Water is like cracking a fresh coconut and sticking in a straw" on the can. I expected something that tasted artificial and sweet. But when I drank it I was very impressed, I remember drinking from real coconut with a straw and Zola coconut water really did taste like that (I guess it's supposed to since it's really 100% pure coconut water). It was not overly sweet and the subtle coconut taste lingers for a little while on your tongue which is very pleasant. Upon examining the nutrition facts (which I always do when I eat/drink something) I was very pleased that it had high amounts of electrolytes. I think it would be a healthier alternative than other juices or sodas after exercising, or even just when you're dehydrated. I wasn't even halfway through the can when I felt full, and I was pretty thirsty (and hungry) when I opened the can, too. For those of you coconut water lovers or someone looking for healthier alternatives than soda/juice/etc, I would definitely recommend buying. One last personal opinion- making the can smaller and therefore reducing the price would make me even more willing to buy it, not that it's really that expensive if you consider the healthy side of it.

review/summary: Perfectly subtle flavor & Not from Concentrate
review/text: I've spent hours in the last few months searching for coconut water with good credentials. Specifically, one  that was, "not from concentrate." However, just about every brand that people, "brag about," (particularly on Amazon where many seem to push specific brands... one above others, to the point they seem like paid reviews or advertisements) are all from concentrate. I had pretty much given up and was willing to settle for what was available, when I stumbled across this can (literally right after buying 2 large cartons of another brand at another store).<br /><br />Funny thing was I found this after leaving my local TJ's to grab some extra items at the Safest of Ways. I stumbled across a can of this and nearly skipped it over chalking up the typical image of a coconut, claims of awesome taste, and the fact that I'd read bad things about coconut water in a can. I did a double take when I saw an easily skipped over statement of, "not from concentrate," after I had already put it back on the shelf, and decided to pony up and give it a try head to head with what I had already bought.<br /><br />Frankly,  I loved it, the other brands were moot points to me then and there, and I immediately started searching for a cheaper way to get it when I got home (which was easy as their website pointed me right back to Amazon) but it wasn't in stock! I ordered anyway, but I'm still waiting for my order to ship. I have had 5 or 6 cans at the $3 price from the store so far because I couldn't wait (and that's all they had left in stock, who knows if they will restock or if things will change).<br /><br />I will remain loyal as long as the product stays the same.<br /><br />If my order shows up and things have changed, I will update my review.<br /><br />Mind you, this review is ONLY FOR THE CAN, as I think the larger carton is listed as, "from concentrate," like every other brand. The carton was also noticeably missing the, "best tasting," badge prominently placed on the can.

review/text: I tried Zola Coconut Water after reading some rave reviews.  I was excited to try a new brand at a good price.  It was good, but not my favorite.  I have tried many brands of coconut water, but I prefer the coconut water from Thai coconuts the best.  The source for Zola is Brazil, I believe.  Some may love it.  It is sweet and refreshing, but there was something about the after taste that I didn't like.  Just my opinion.  Worth trying.

review/text: My review is for the aseptic pack.<br /><br />The ingredients state it is from concentrate and has natural flavors added.

I think the taste is alright. I have found other brands that I personally think are better tasting. (My favorite is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083KPP7W">Taste Nirvana, Coconut Wtr Pulp Natural, 9.5 FO (Pack of 12) ( Value Bulk Multi-pack)</a>. I rate this 3 stars = It's Okay.

review/text: Having tried a couple of coconut water brands now, I can say with certainty that this is the most pleasing to my palette. However, I attribute it to sugar being added... or a regional breed of coconut with higher sugar content.<br /><br />I'm drinking some Naked 100% coconut water, and it's no where near as tasty; it's also more what I remember drinking in the Philippines during my time there. I like this stuff, and I think it's actually a more refreshing beverage because of the lack of sweetness.<br /><br />That said... I like sweet, so I prefer Zola's.

review/summary: yummy nutty flavor - excellent drink!
review/text: I love coconut water and have tried most varieties at my local grocery stores. I was excited to try this new variety.<br /><br />It comes in a tall can. I don't mind this although I prefer glass so I can put the lid back on and save it for later. On the other hand, it encourages me to stay extra hydrated because I don't want to waste any, so I go ahead and drink it all. Also, there has been recent news questioning BPA inside the lining of many canned food items. This can does not say whether or not it is BPA free.<br /><br />The can does state gluten-free, vegan, and non-GMO. I don't know differences in the production of coconut water, so I cannot comment on the sustainability of this company. In terms of taste quality though, it's as good as my favorites. A distinguishing characteristic for me is a distinctable nutty finish on your tongue. Not strong in any way, just light and sweet enough to make you crave another drink. This one definitely has it!<br /><br />Only thing missing for me was the pulp!

review/summary: Best coconut water out there!
review/text: This coconut water has a great, sweet taste, but it is not too sweet.  It is very refreshing.  This coconut water is the best out there.  I've tried all the rest, and almost all of them have some sort of weird aftertaste that almost tastes like there is some bitter aluminum in them.  I believe this isn't made from the typical coconuts that the other drinks are made from.  It really doesn't matter what it's made from because it tastes great and is great for you, besides the fact that it isn't good for you to drink sugar all the time.  But hey, it has less sugar than almost all other fruit juices out there, so if you are going to drink juice, it might as well be this.<br /><br />There is one major flaw with this product.  It is literally so addicting that I cannot stop drinking it.  It has become a seriously expensive habit that I cannot break.  I cleaned out several of the stores around my area that carry this brand.  I finally decided that I needed to just start ordering it from Amazon instead.

They were about $3.99 at the store and lucky I found them there or else pay for big fee of shipping (but then again, i suppose these would be worth the price for how deelish they are!) so check em out at your nearest world market!

review/summary: The Third Bite
review/text: These cookies will surprise you, but only if you take at least 3 bites.  I shared my box with friends and family, yet each of us noticed a pattern.<br /><br />Bite 1 will remind you vaguely of other US cookies-candies yet you cant place the taste.  Bite 2 you'll say, "This is pretty good but not worth importing it from Australia.". By bite 3, you'll be searching for more.  Each of my friends who tried one vowed on their 3rd bite to buy them online or when the holiday season finally brings some to Target.  My coworker tried a Tim Tam slam (bite the ends then suck milk through like a straw before eating it).  She went from not impressed in bite 1 to asking me to help her order enough some from Australia.<br /><br />This isn't a soft or gourmet cookie.  Its similar to the simple joys of an oreo but far more addictive when you reach bite 3.  The closest comparison i can give is BERGER COOKIES from Baltimore which are simple but beyond addictive.

review/summary: a great cookie!
review/text: Love these and am glad to be able to get them here.  If you're looking for a rich chocolate cookie, Tim Tams are it.  Not sure which American cookie to compare them to, probably a chocolate covered Oreo, but with a chocolate middle.  Lots of chocolate here.  That's actually a downside for me.  Too much chocolate.  A little goes a long way with me, so these are amazing in moderation and with a big glass of milk.

review/summary: These kick Oreos in the Behind
review/text: I'm not sure what "Hipcat 21" is referring to, but the Tim Tams I just ate from Australia would be pretty darn hard to suck milk through. They are a layered wafer cookie, and you'd have to have the suction of a Hoover vacuum to pull milk through those babies. But, they are amazing little pieces of heaven, even if completely worthless as a straw. They are crispy, and chocolaty, and so darned good that I would gladly give up my Double Stuff Oreos if these were widely sold in the US. Those lucky Australians!!

There is a catch with ordering them from Amazon: THEY TAKE FOREVER TO GET TO YOU. Mine probably spent 2 and a half weeks with Singapore customs.

review/summary: One of the Best Cookies I've Ever Tasted
review/text: Don't be fooled. It is a biscuit...but it tastes more like a chocolate bar, and has calories to match. Yet this is probably Australia's best treat. It is very good. I was surprised. It's fun to eat and it tastes very good. The level of sweetness is just right. While I describe Tim Tam as a dense malt chocolate biscuit, with a dense chocolaty creme atop, covered in milk chocolate, I must say that it's much more than that (as far as sweets are concerned). Try it out. I'm assured that you won't be disappointed. It's also fun to bit off two end and suck in milk to make it mushy. This is definitely a classic, up there with the Oreo, or higher.

review/summary: Love the flavors
review/text: I am in love with the Rise Bar brand. My favorites are their breakfast bars, which have a chunkier and crispier consistency. The energy bars have more of a "Powerbar" like texture, everything is ground, with some shredded coconut added to some flavors for interest. Little bits of amaranth add some texture too, but they are still more soft and chewy than crunchy. That said, the energy bars taste pretty amazing too, and are a better alternative for strict vegans (sweetened with brown rice syrup and tapioca syrup instead of honey).<br /><br />To note, the Rise Energy Bars are very sweet, and almost dessert-like in my opinion. I enjoyed them most as a mid-day treat, particularly when I hit an afternoon lull before a workout. Plus, they are the perfect size for a sustainable energy snack.<br /><br />I love all of the "superfruit" inspired flavors, which are a fun change from the ordinary. That said, I think the blueberry and coconut is still my favorite - the flavors really stand out and are great together!

review/summary: My favorite energy bar
review/text: I've tried a bunch of different energy bars and this is my favorite. It's not as heavy as some, is quite satisfying, and is not too sweet. It is also organic, mostly raw (which I think is healthier), and doesn't have a ton of weird non-food ingredients. It's also fairly tidy to eat - I like the kind bars also, but they are very sweet and very messy. Generally I cut it in 1/2 - as I don't think I need all the calories at once, and use it as an in-between meal snack, or to help fill me up if I've only had a smoothie or salad for a meal. I used to be a big fan of the lara bars, but I prefer these. I've bought this flavor and the coconut flavor - and buy both in bulk on on subscribe and save.

review/summary: Great taste, fun to chew, strong scientific backing for health claims of Xylitol
review/text: After using an "all-natural" gum (that contained cane sugar) and getting my first cavity in 12 years after 6 months of use, I knew I needed a switch. I heard about Xylitol from a naturopathic student, that basically, the bad bacteria in your mouth feed on Xylitol but they can't digest it, and the good bacteria can eat it, so they proliferate. I thought I had tried other Xylitol gums in the past and didn't like them, but I decided to give this another chance because I want a gum to chew after meals that is actually good for my teeth. I was pleasantly surprised at the Spry gum! It has a great flavor (which goes away pretty soon after chewing, but it's a nice shot of good taste), but the best part is that the gum itself has a great texture to it and continues to be fun to chew for as long as you want. It doesn't even turn hard after drinking water like most gums do. I am a medical student so I did a search of the research literature and the claims of Xylitol are more than proven. However, all of the literature and research studies explain that you need 4-12 g of Xylitol a day (no need to get more than 15), but the average piece of gum has .75-1 g, so you'll need to chew at least 4-5 pieces a day to get the dental benefits (chewing it only sporadically, i.e. once a day, did NOT show any dental benefits). No problem for me, I chew one after every meal (I have 5-6 a day), and love having the fresh clean feeling as well as knowing that I'm doing something great for my teeth.

review/summary: Helps to Reduce Cavities
review/text: After chewing one piece of Spry peppermint gum you may notice your teeth and gums feeling more healthy. Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar as an ingredient, this item caught my attention.<br /><br />Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It can be commercially manufactured from "xylan hemicellulose" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. Some Xylitol products are also made from corn.<br /><br />This product is made with a Xylitol, gum base, natural flavors, glycerin, gum Arabic, soy lecithin and beesewax.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br /><br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />What more could we ask for from a gum? This gum is a natural defense system and you will start to notice the results. Unlike other sugary gums, this will reduce cavities and it is just as flavorful, if not more so than most gums.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: This is a great product
review/text: I tried to find chewing gum at my local supermarket that did NOT contain aspartame, or some other man-made sugar substitute.  I never was able to.  I checked my local health food store and they sell Spry gum and Spry toothpaste.  The gum is just as good tasting as any major brand, and it doesn't hurt my stomach.  It doesn't become ultra sticky like major brand gum either, so I can give it to my 3-year-old and 1-year-old without worry.  The flavor doesn't last too long, but chewing it is good for your teeth, so I don't have a problem going through it quicker than major brand gum.  One of the best parts - it's cheaper than major brand gum.  I get a pack of 10 for $0.89 from my local food store.  The others cost $1.10 at the supermarket.<br />I also tried their toothpaste and I love it.  I use it everyday.  It's safe for my little ones too.  It says right on the label that there's nothing to worry about if the toothpaste is swallowed, because it is not harmful since the product is fluoride-free and all natural.  I highly recommend Spry products - especially for families.

review/text: Being a gum addict, I go through a pack a day. Sugar does a number on your teeth, so I prefer sugar-free... or I did, until I read how many cancer causing ingredients the leading gum brands have. You might as well smoke ;-). That's where SPRY comes in... made with Xylitol, a natural sugar derivative (and not `natural' like Splenda) it has a long lasting flavor and good texture. The only problem I ran into is that the consistency degrades after about 30 minutes of chewing.<br /><br />All in all, for a 30 min gum fix, Spry is #1.

review/summary: Not Gluten Free enough...
review/text: Even though there is a statement right on the front of these packages of gum that claims "Gluten Free", I don't believe this gum really is.  I bought a pack of Peppermint from the health food store that my daughter and I both chewed (we are GF/Celiac) and we BOTH reacted to this gum.  We both tried it again a few days later, thinking perhaps it was something else we had eaten, considering this gum says Gluten Free right on the front.  The reaction was WORSE the second time around!!!  This company sources their Xylitol from China, and almost all the companies I looked at online that you can purchase Xylitol from also make lots of Wheat Gluten----so I am assuming some sort of cross contamination at the source of production in China, for which this Spry company does not test for!  They are obviously just assuming that the product is 'naturally' gluten free and taking unreliable China's word for it----at the expense of customers with Celiac disease who get sick from this product.  Very disappointed.

review/summary: Loses flavor FAST; most likely not worth it
review/text: Ever since Trident White changed their "formula" to create a better flavor (which I do not care for at all), I've been on the search for a newer, better sugar-free gum. My dentist recommended Spry, so I thought I'd give it a chance. It's pricier than most of the sugarfree gums I frequent, but it came recommended by an oral expert, so I figured it would be worth a try.<br /><br />NOT WORTH IT.<br /><br />Literally, after less than 4 minutes, the flavor is completely gone, and the gum itself reverts to a stale, slightly metallic, tough-to-chew state of existence. I'm not sure how much teeth cleaning the Xylitol in the gum itself is doing because it seems to lose flavor so fast. Correct me if I'm wrong, but xylitol is a sweetener, so if the sweetness of the gum is lost after a good (or bad?) 3 minutes, then there really wasn't that much Xylitol to begin with?<br /><br />Also, further research showed that you actually need more xylitol than the amount in the gum itself before it proves to be beneficial.<br /><br />Given how much xylitol is in the Spry gum, it's neither good nor bad to be chewing Spry, and what tips that balance towards "No Thanks" is the fact that it is not worth its value.<br /><br />This is USEFUL information for those who want to chew gum to freshen their breath, or prolong the feeling of minty goodness in their mouth for more than just a couple of minutes!

review/summary: Nice after meals.
review/text: I bought Spry spearmint gum because I hoped it would help me get rid of sugar cravings.  It hasn't worked too well for me.<br /><br />I do like the spearmint flavor, but it only lasts for a few minutes. (After that it has kind of a chemical flavor that doesn't taste good.)  I do like chewing this gum after meals; it works great to freshen things up.<br /><br />This gum feels really small in my mouth.  Maybe two pieces would be better?<br /><br />BUY THIS: if you want to freshen your breath after meals, if you only want to chew gum for a couple minutes, and maybe if you want to share gum with kids (since the xylitol is better than sugary gums and artificial sugars are pretty scary).<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS: if you want to chew your gum for very long.

review/summary: Good for dieting
review/text: I am giving up candy and sweets for one month and then going to continue best I can.  I am loving this as an alternative.  It has the hard candy shell which I really need right now. Is a more firm gum so it won't stick.  If you like the really soft gums, then this is not for you. Since I am using it for weight loss I like that I have to chew a bit. Perfect cinnamon bite.  Not too hot, but has that little bite.  Average lasting in flavor.<br />Great for travel.

review/summary: Flavor doesn't last
review/text: I was looking for a gum with xylitol and found lots of good reviews on this one. It has more xylitol than some other gums, such as Trident.<br /><br />Overall, it's just OK. I'll finish off what I purchased, but I'll also be looking at other gums with xylitol.<br /><br />After chewing for a few seconds, I noticed the gum feels very small, which makes it less satisfying to chew. As a comparison, the tiny Trident gum I used to chew felt almost twice as large in my mouth as this Spry gum. Not a huge deal, but if you have a large mouth, you may need/want to chew two pieces at a time, which increases the cost.<br /><br />Good:<br />Contains more xylitol than some other gums, such as Trident.<br />Good flavor (while it lasts).<br /><br />Not so great:<br />Flavor lasts less than 30 seconds. Still tastes ok after flavor is gone.<br />Individual piece of gum seems very small after chewing.

review/text: If it wasn't for dentally beneficial ingredient Xylitol in this gum, this gum would be 2 stars.  The gum was small; had to chew two to get the same size feel as National brand sugarless gums. The flavor faded quickly and had slightly bitter after taste.<br /><br />If you want gum with Xylitol, Ice Breakers Ice Cube in any flavor is the gold standard in my book.

I am not going to comment on the effects of chewing gum to reduce cavities, lose weight, catch the eye of the person on the subway you are attracted to, or eliminate planters warts on the bottoms of your feet. I will not go into the wonders of this gum, and how I keep packs in my desk at work, in my car, and under my pillow for those late night cravings.<br /><br />However, I will state that this is a great price to pay for twenty packs of this gum. In the stores, this gum runs about $2 a pack. The price I paid through Amazon is less than 75 cents per pack. I no longer have to feel guilty when I take that second piece because sometimes one piece just isn't enough.<br /><br />This is a great, guilt free, chemical free, wonderful tasting and long lasting gum. If there were just some way to harness the power from gum chewers' jaws into a clean energy...

review/text: I got the gum because my dentist recommended it to keep cavities at bay. It arrived quickly and was in good condition. The gum was fresh and had a good cinnimon flavor. The intense flavor didn't last any longer than most gum. I'm chewing it after meals when I am not near a toothbrush and during the day when I would normally reach for a snack. So far I have no complaints but I have not been to a dentist to see if there is a difference in my teeth condition.

review/summary: Great Deal and Good for You!
review/text: This gum contains xylitol, a sugar that the "good" bacteria in your mouth like, so they can thrive and can help you avoid cavities. One piece chews down pretty small and loses its flavor fairly quickly but I only chew it to clean my mouth. It does its job and this pack is a good deal because you would find 1 pack for .99$ in stores.

review/summary: Eliminates bad breath, tastes great, handy packaging
review/text: I was researching dental health one day and found lots of evidence proving how great xylitol is for oral health and teeth (although it is deadly for dogs so beware of leaving it lying around and don't litter!  Unfortunately, over the counter gums have other ingredients that counteract or nullify xylitol's positive effects.<br /><br />Spry is a great example of a gum that is really pure in its delivery of xylitol.  If you get into the habit of chewing a piece or two after you eat (I prefer chewing two pieces at a time to extend the flavor) it's meant to eliminate the bad bacteria in your mouth and prevent acidic foods from doing damage, leading to staining and cavities on your teeth.  Plus, Spry is very inexpensive!<br /><br />An added benefit I noticed is that it increases salivation, which is very good for me since I am prone to having a somewhat dry mouth.<br /><br />I love the peppermint flavor- this gum doesn't give you an aftertaste and leaves my mouth and breath fresher than they've ever been in my life. I agree with other reviewers that the gum does lose the majority of flavor after a few minutes of chewing, but it's not unpleasant until about 30 minutes into chewing, which is better for your jaw anyway. I have not had any abdominal discomfort at all from chewing this gum.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product

review/text: Good product! If you are set on chewing gum this is the stuff. You can feel the difference, teeth stay cleaner between brushings. Sugar sweetened gum will degrade your dental health if you are a constant gum chewer like me. I just hope they don't find out something seriously wrong with xylitol down the road. ;)

review/summary: Good, but could last longer.
review/text: I'm a gum fanatic, but usually I'm used to the sugary versions, or else the very minty alternatives.  I'm trying Spry for the first time, and I think it's a fantastic gum, but I feel the flavor runs out very quickly, and it also comes in very small portions.  The packaging is also frustrating, because I'm used to pushing into the tab for the gum to come out, but the packet that actually holds the gum is small compared to the sleeve, so you have to shake it out.

review/text: I like Spry because I know it's good for me, but the gum size is meager, and the flavor, while good, doesn't last long. So I pop in two pieces at a time and just enjoy it while I can. I kind of assume that the reason it doesn't last is because it doesn't have a lot of the nasty chemicals in it to preserve it, so I am willing to accept the tradeoff for better health!

review/text: This product has xylitol in it and its useful/good for your teeth, I get it. But, at the end of the day I chew gum to freshen my breath up. The flavor of Spry lasts only for 3-5 minutes. Then you are basically chewing on flavorless gum. You need to chew atleast 2 at a time to feel the flavor. This product might be good for your teeth if used extensively but honestly I think its overrated. You will do as well with any sugarless gum like Trident, which has xylitol too and lasts much longer. Not to mention that its expensive too as compared to Trident or any other sugarless alternatives.

review/summary: Got The Funny Bones "Jones."
review/text: When I first bit into this chocolate-wrapped peanut butter creme-filled cake called a "Funny Bone," I was only 7 years old and lived in Middletown, N.Y.  I was hooked from the first package that I ate.  I wanted more, but as a child you're only allowed so much sugar (as is the correct way to raise a child to eat).  Now that I'm old enough to eat more without going super-hyper, I can't find them.  It's been hard looking for them in my previous home of North Carolina, and even harder trying to find them in my current home of Virginia.  The only way to buy a box now would be to pay almost $30 for it!?  It would be unacceptable to mark a less-than-$4 product up that high (w/shipping combined) if these cakes didn't taste so damn good.  Drake's, if you can read this, stop playing and start creating more distribution points to sell these delicious (and normally affordable) cakes to more than just the great people of New York.

review/summary: dates matter !!!
review/text: I was concerned when my friend recieved the shipment of funny bones from amazon that I had purchased her for her birhtday. She called and thanked me for them ,they are her favorites,but informed me she needed to freeze some of them. I asked her why did she want to do that, she said that the dates of expiration on each was about to expire within a week or so. I dont have the exact dates but they were very close to expiration. They were fresh and tasted fine, but I believed that for the amount of shipping involved that they should be at least comparable to simmilar product in stores which had expiration dates at least 2 months out.Again the produts were still fresh and were not expired, but only for a week. my friend is a diabetic so cramming 40 funnybones into her within a week would have caused lots of nasty problems.I am only hoping that in the future if I am top order something offline with a high cost of shipping, I would get a little time to enjoy them befor they outdate. thank you , huey c wright jr.

I wasn't too happy with the shipping costs, much like everyone else on here, but supposedly they're worth it, so I decided to order 2 sets. That's 40 Funny Bones. I guess the shipping was worth it, since the estimated delivery date was between Dec 8th and Dec 13th. The order came the 7th. Thank goodness, because the expiration date on 2 of the boxes was the 10th. Not quite sure what they were thinking on that one. Hopefully these are like Twinkies and don't go too terrible after the expiration, considering they were supposed to be a Christmas present...

review/summary: Kitties Eat this Tuna Up
review/text: Usually I do not feed my kitties Tuna that is not the variety from the grocery store...Albacore which is what I eat. It goes on sale so often for one dollar a car that buying Tuna in some other packaging has always seemed dumb. Nut this YellowFin by Fancy Feast comes in a TriPak that I buy. Since mine are Albacore eaters, I thought it would be worthy of noting that they Scarf down this Medly made by Fancy Feast, so Fancy Feast must be doing something really right when they put their tuna in this medly. I recommend it because they Eat it All and they recommend it in the following ways: running to the bowl to eat it. Eating it All. Doing a contentented whisker clean after eating. Having nothing left to "cover up" when supper is over. We all say: Buy it and try it. We like it and hope you will also!

review/summary: Incredible!
review/text: These are amazing!! I eat them daily as a snack(s) and prefer them over anything else u could put in front of me!  They are AMAZING!!! Try them just once....you will NOT be disappointed! You will only want more! .....my favorites are Choc chip, banana nut and macadamia with white chocolate. I've tried all of them though and there's not any kind that I don't like! Those are just my own personal favs. It honestly seems funny that something so yummy could lower my cholesterol! I'm a pharmacist and checked into the use of plant sterols and they are very right! How something I WANT is so good for me blows my mind though!

review/text: The "Atkins Fudge Brownie Advantage Bars" are a great tasting, low carb snack. These tasted better than some candy bars!<br /><br />Being diabetic, I have to watch my carbs and the Atkins bars are a great way for me to have a late night snack without sending my blood sugar levels too high.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/summary: When lactose is a problem, Sensitive formula is a good solution.
review/text: There have been some harsh reviews about the ingredients in the liquid Similac Sensitive.  It is true that milk based formula should be first choice as it is closest to mother's milk.  When milk can't be used due to a lactose intolerance, another form of carbohydrate is needed.  Corn maltodextrin is just an easily digested sugar.  It IS used as a "filler" in adult food.  This is not always a good thing because as adults  we don't need extra empty calories.  Babies DO need the calories and easily processed sugar are a gentile way to get them.  There is a history of (baby and adult) lactose intolerance on my husbands side.  After trying to reduce gas in many other ways, we switched and have seen a great reduction in gas amount and pains.  It has not been a cure, but with other gas management techniques, we are all happier.<br /><br />Pros: Already made for travel or middle of the night feedings.  Good for babies that are sensitive to lactose.<br />Cons: Some complain about the dark formula color stains.  Higher price than powder.

review/summary: Perfect For Our Son
review/text: After using kinesiology (muscle testing) and determining that many formulas were bad for our baby, we gave this a shot.  I'm so glad we did.  It was a strong test, and sure enough, our son loves it as a supplement to breast milk.  No whey, wheat or rice protein - apparently just what he needed.  People are complaining about the corn.  I would ask them this: have you asked your baby's body what it needs?

review/summary: Babies on the move
review/text: If you are feeding Similac Sensitive then buy these now. We purchased a box to have for the diaper bag and for back-up. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the size. Our newborn isn't drinking 8 oz yet so have to throw it in the fridge once open and if your not near a fridge you have to throw it out. But when you have a crying newborn in one arm you'll do anything to make them happy!
