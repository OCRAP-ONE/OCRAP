review/summary: Please Don't Tell Anyone!
review/text: Please don't tell anyone about these Polar Kipper Snacks!<br /><br />I am afraid if the word gets out about just HOW GOOD THESE ARE, there might be a shortage of them.<br /><br />These are, without a doubt, the single BEST canned type of fish in existence. Nice large fillets of firm fish, individually trimmed, PERFECTLY smoked, and packed in the lightest of brine.<br /><br />They TASTE LIKE CANDY!<br /><br />Really, just like CANDY.<br /><br />I used to give cans of Sardines out for Halloween, but I refuse to since I found this product. I don't want to share these with ANYONE! (Especially that little Norwegian kid down the street that changes his Halloween costume and comes back to the door for Sardines two and three times)<br /><br />As I can afford it, I will be filling my basement with cases of this product in preparation for the 2012 End of the World Event.<br /><br />Nothing Better. A Bit 'o Heaven in a Can.

review/summary: OK
review/text: These are okay. I've been getting Brunswick as long as I can remember and thought I'd try these because they cost a bit less. These are much, much milder. They are not as smokey or fishy. I think I like the consistency of these better, they aren't as flaky and each filet comes from a single fish. If the price difference between this fish and King Oscar and Brunswick remain as high, I'll probably get them again.

That's like expecting soy milk to taste exactly like cow's milk! Not gonna happen. I think the folks at Rightously Raw got this one...well...right. The filling has a richness & depth that are reminiscent of caramel, the chocolate is superb, and you can enjoy it with total peace of mind. I'll take that any day over a sugar-bomb of "real" caramel!

review/text: What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it. What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling). I think this product is a masterpiece, taste-wise and texture-wise. The only obstacles for my family to buying from this brand often are the price and the presence of some added sugar (relatively little though, judging by the numbers on their labels; I just wanted to point out that agave nectar is especially high in fructose, the "worst" of "simple sugars", and this brand uses some agave nectar - hopefully very little). This brand's other bars, Acai and "Caramel", are similar, but "Maca" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing.

review/text: At first we thought the bar was damaged by heat... or was too old (despite exp. date saying otherwise). A few months later we bought it again (from a different store) - same problem. And now (especially since another reviewer had the same problem) I think this MACA bar is designed to be like that. It's NOT chocolaty. It tastes and looks like something else. It may satisfy a sweet tooth, but it's not worth the price. Their other 3 flavors taste fabulous (Acai, Goji, "Caramel"). Not the healthiest though, due to some added sugar.

After two bites it ended in the garbage. Oh well...<br /><br />For now I'll stick to Lindt 85% Cacao bars which are cheap and meet my needs of a very low sugar chocolate treat.

review/text: These were selling in my gym and I decided to try this and the Caraeml (which I reviewed separately and gave two stars).<br /><br />I managed to eat two bites of the caramel. I spat out the first bite of this one. It tastes disgusting. Furthermore, despite it not being passed its sell-by-date (two months from now) it looks bad. The caramel bar looks like dark chocolate; this looks like medium brown sand.<br /><br />Definitely the worst chocolate I've ever had (and in a world full of Hershey's that is saying something).

review/summary: Beware!
review/text: This was an impulse buy while standing in line at an organic foods market. First off, I have to say that I've had raw chocolate before, and I really like dark chocolate. So after a surprising cost of $5 I was hoping for the best tasting sweet to ever hit me in the mouth. Wow, I just have to say that this was so awful that I feel like I have to warn the world. I was a little disappointed in the small size of it at first, but now I understand that no one could stand to eat one of these if they were full sized. For one, the "caramel" is an unflavored paste-like substance  , and the only way I can describe the whole eating experience is by likening it to having a pill get stuck in the back of your throat and being stuck with that rancid flavor until you manage to eat something less horrible. As I sit here in my buyers remorse stupor, I can't stop thinking about the many more pleasing things I could have done with my $5. For instance, I could go bowling, tip a stripper, wash my car, or buy 2 or 3 less disgusting chocolate bars. I'm only righting this review in the hopes that I may keep some other poor unsuspecting shopper from being duped as I was.

Now how can you complain about that? I'm adding it to my cart.

review/summary: GOOD PRODUCT AT A GOOD PRICE AT THIS TIME.
review/text: Of the various grinds that Maxwell House produces, this is our favorite.  To be quite honest, I (we) can tell little difference between this product and the like product produced and sold by Folgers.  Coffee, like so many other things in life is purely a matter of choice and to a great extent, what you get use to.  When it comes right down to it, we usually buy what ever is on sale at the time of purchase.  More about that later.<br /><br />Now I am a person that enjoyed a milder, less intense coffee; less intense that what we find in this product.  My wife enjoys a strong, robust and flavorful coffee (which this grind of Maxwell House is), so we compromise and go with the strong, robust and flavorful grind of coffee.  Hey, you have to pick your battles you know.<br /><br />Now neither my wife nor I are what you would call coffee snobs; an unfortunate term, I know, but I use it here just to make a point.  I realize that there are many, many individuals who prefer to buy their own coffee beans; fresh coffee beans, grind them and go from there.  This is a good thing.  I have had many a cup of coffee prepared as such and have enjoyed them...for the most part.  In our case though, the extra time involved, the extra cost involved; for both the bean and a quality grinder, and the extra hassle simply is not worth it.  We drink two pots of coffee daily, at the very least.  This is a personal choice though and each person must pick their own path and choose what is best for them and their situation.<br /><br />I am setting here writing this review drinking a cup of coffee.  It is the Folgers equivalent to the Maxwell grind being reviewed here.  The reason for this is that we are able to get it on sale at the time of purchase.  To be honest, I cannot tell a whole lot of difference from the last can we opened which happened to be Maxwell House.  It does taste better due to the fact I got a good buy on it and the saving of my coinage makes it much sweeter.<br /><br />The price here on Amazon, as of this writing, is quite good and extremely competitive if you have one of the programs here that include free or reduced shipping.  Amazon's Subscription program can save you a lot of money if you are a heavy shopper here...no doubt.<br /><br />This is a good product, we like it and the cost here is very good at this time.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: Maxwell House French Roast Coffee Is NOT French Roast!!!!
review/text: I have purchased this product twice in the 29.3 oz size. Both times, I have been disappointed. As a French Roast aficionado, I know what French Roast coffee should look and smell like. True French Roast coffee bean and grounds should be almost black in color with a pungent, almost burnt, aroma. These characteristic are imparted from the "over roasting" process which brings out the distinguishing flavor and aroma of the coffee beans. Furthermore, during the roasting process, the French Roast beans lose more moisture than normally roasted coffee beans. Therefore, the French Roast grounds have lower density and weighs less than normally roasted beans for an equivalent volume. The Maxwell House French roast has none of the traditional French Roast characteristics. The grounds color is much lighter than that of true French Roast, the aroma is not like true French Roast grounds, and the flavor is just like regular roast coffee. In addition, the grounds have the same density as regular Roast Coffee grounds. I am very disappointed with Maxwell House brand French Roast. Someone in the Coffee Division should learn how to properly roast the French Roast coffee.

It had more coffee flavor but this could be just the difference between a "French Roast" versus "%100 Colombian". Anyway, in a comparison of these brands and styles, I liked the Folgers better which had a little stronger flavor.

review/text: I am delighted with my Maxwell House Coffee.  I have NO PLANS TO CANCEL THIS ORDER!  This coffee works great in my new BUNN Coffee Maker.  The last time I served coffee to a friend, she inquired about the type of coffee I was using.  When I told her "Maxwell House," she seemed a little surprised.  In todays coffee-hype era, we think there has to be some type of gimmick to make the coffee taste great.  WRONG!  We just need to sit down to a great tasting cup of good old Maxwell House.  It worked for my mother and it does now for me, too.  It also doesn't hurt to know that the price I pay is for two 33 ounce jugs and not just the one for that great price!  Keep it up Amazon and pretty soon I will be purchasing EVERYTHING from you!<br /><br />Sincerely<br /><br />Becky Stewart

review/summary: Good coffee!
review/text: The packaging is great.<br /><br />I keep coffee upside-down in the refrigerator. That is supposed to keep it fresher. Usually, when you open a container that was kept upside-down, the contents spill from the cover. Not with this container. I'm very impressed!<br /><br />Of more importance, the coffee is delicious!

review/summary: what the beef? - 2nd update
review/text: i am just about to order this from amazon when i started to read the 5 reviews.  maybe because i live and shop in new york, but, WHAT IS THE BEEF ABOUT THE PRICE?  my supermarket sells the regular can (11 oz) of maxwell house french roast for $3.99.  all the other supermarkets, a&p, pathmark, etc., sell for the same price and some a $1.00 more.  that make it 33 oz (3 cans worth) for $12.00. here, i am getting 6 can worth for $13.00.  AM I MISSING SOMETHING?  maybe it just logistics...you think!<br /><br />2/2/11 - UPDATE....i WAS going to reorder the coffee but it seems that it is no longer available from amazon.  a third-party is selling the pack of two for over $30.00.  oh well, at least i can get ONE 33oz jug for #$13.00 at duane reade instead of the TWO jugs from amazon.<br /><br />6/1/11 - UPDATE.....on may 8, 2011, i ordered TWO 2-packs for $15.58 each or $31.16 for four 33oz jugs which amazon sold itsself. i want to stock up for the iced coffee afternoons and lo and behold, amazon itself (NOT a third-party) is now selling this coffee for over $30.00 for a two-pack -- in less than 4 weeks time. if i can't get it from amzon, the third-parties rarely has a chance and, in this case, none!  amazon has just lost a customer on this item.

review/text: Hard to review coffee.  Unless it's just flat out bad, it is truly a matter of personal preference.  This is definitely not bad coffee, but I prefer a smoother, milder blend.  You may prefer stronger, bolder coffee, in which case this may be great for you.  I don't.  I prefer Folger's Classic Roast, or Maxwell House Master Blend.

review/summary: Tied with FOLGERS dark silk blend.
review/text: I found this is one of the easiest ways to shop for coffee. The Subsribe and Save program saves you money and you never wake up to an empty can. priced well and I prefer Maxwell House or Folgers better than the fancy coffee house brands. Maxwell House French Roast (Medium Dark) Ground Coffee, 33-Ounce Jugs (Pack of 2).<br />A trip to store, $10 , two canisters of coffee $16, plus tax and hassle. Have is delivered free without tax for $18. Without the hassle.<br /><br />Maxwell House still has that GOOD TO THE LAST DROP taste and flavor. I recommend this product when you can find it sold through the Subscribe and Save program.

review/summary: Great Popcorn kit for fans or lovers.
review/text: My g/f got me a popcorn maker for Xmas. Knowing that I really only go to the movies anymore just for the popcorn, we decided to try and replicate it on our own.  There are several ways to achieve that. Mainly the oil and salt topping, but kernels should not be over looked.  I went with this gift set because it has 6 types of kernels ranging from very light and airy(think carnival or circus popcorn) to medium grade and color(movie theaterish but better) to dark and small(cant compare to anything).  It also comes with popcorn salt and butter topping that seal the deal. The southwestern spice is delicious but I rarely use it on the fresh batches.  I prefer to save it for the tail end as it makes me sneeze.  I rate this 5 stars and would certainly recommend to a friend. Best of all you can sample about 5-8 batches of each flavor before you decide which kernel you want to buy in bulk.  They are all great, but my favorite is the Red River valley with 2 parts salt to 1 part butter topping.<br /><br />**You will want to buy some coconut oil to pop in for the true theater taste and color.

review/text: Poor instructions, takes forever to grow and must be repotted.  I have a "green thumb" and my plants are still only 1/2" tall after almost 2 months. You're much better off just buying some catnip seeds and using your own potting soil and pot.  Any pot would look better than the cheap plastic tub provided.<br /><br />It's not catnip but I highly recommend the Kitty Garden:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8ID2E">SmartCat 3844 Kitty?s Garden Edible Grass Planter</a>  It grows fast, looks good and my kittens love it.

review/summary: Plants grow fine, but kind of a ripoff
review/text: Within a month or two I had counted about 60 lil catnip plants growing.  But, the instructions suck.  This was my first time growing anything before.  I had to look up on the internet why my catnip plants started to not do so well. I learned that they were growing long and spindly from not getting enough sun.  And that I was watering them wrong with too much water at a time.  Plus I waited waay too long to replant and separate them.<br /><br />This is kind of a ripoff.  What you get is around 70-80 seeds and a tiny cup of dirt.  Looking on amazon, I could buy 400 catnip seeds for around $2-3, a bag of potting soil for $3 and a small pot, but larger than the cup, for a buck.

review/text: It's summertime, and everyone who enjoys the German beer gardens knows that it's the season for hefe weizen!<br />Dark amber in color and opaque from top fermenting yeast, this hefe weizen drinks easily and finishes slightly sour on the palate.  It's a good summertime beer -- full of flavor yet not overly heavy.  Admittedly, I have had other hefe weizens that I've liked a little bit more.  However, this is still a very respectable beer, worthy of merit.  This beer will definitely make my secondary rotation; when I'm looking for something a little bit different, I will keep this one in mind.

The treats are soft enough for me to put a pill into one of them by just firmly pressing and my dog loves them!  Plus, they are small enough that I can feed a few of them to my Great Dane at one time (but they are not so small that he feels cheated and doesn't really taste anything).<br />I am a big fan of Cloud Star brand treats and these are no exception - the ingredients are all real and recognizable and I feel comfortable feeding them to my dog.

review/text: Wife used this pack on our 10 mile excursion into the San Juan Wilderness area. Seems to work just o.k. The only real complaint is the non-standard hydration bladder compartment. I purchased two camelback bladders. My pack has two vertical compartments in main section. This pack uses a "square" bladder in the fanny pack section. We just zipped her bladder in the vertical outside pocket. Worked pretty good that way. Being able to access the bottom of the pack without unloading everything is a nice feature. It is just o.k. because of the price, and non-standard hydration compartment. Also, unrolling 4 feet(exageration) of material to load top is a pain.

review/summary: An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee
review/text: One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like "I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the "Original Donut Blend" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those "special" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]

review/summary: Our Top Choice Coffee
review/text: When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of<br />K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied<br />from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types.  We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating<br />of one point meant "Perfect, couldn't be better", and five points<br />indicated "Don't like this one".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.  We do not<br />prefer the weaker strengths.  The Parisian Nights has great flavor and<br />aroma with no bitterness.  This is a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two<br />months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee.

review/summary: Best Chocolate Flavor by Far
review/text: I'm a chocoholic and have tried every mocha, swiss almond chocolate, etc. coffee I've ever seen, k-cup and not k-cup.  This is the best.  It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.  Enjoy!!

review/summary: Espresso
review/text: I bought a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas this year. We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good.

review/text: Thanks to our purchase of a Keurig, I am a converted coffee drinker. Timothy's German Chocolate Cake is my absolute favorite. A delectable blend of warm caramel and coconut gives this coffee a deliciously sweet note while retaining a medium-bodied blend. It isn't too sugary - it's just right! In fact, my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too. It is scrumptious.

review/summary: Need to brew small cup size.  Check the price!
review/text: I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this.  Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans.  We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally.  I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery.  I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed.  I usually brew on the 3rd largest size.  I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes.<br /><br />This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews.  Those who can only brew (or choose to brew) smaller sizes probably like this coffee.<br /><br />Make sure you check the price before you buy.  Click more buying choices to get to Amazon's price which is almost half the price of Liquid Nation's and it is eligible for prime.  Why doesn't that show up as a default?

review/summary: If you prefer a smooth cup of coffee
review/text: I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to "double brew" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off.

review/summary: European perfection; domestic American price
review/text: First off, this is one of the best candies I've ever tasted - and I say that having had many Haribo candies. I took advantage of a candy store in Vigo, Spain to stock up on Haribo before heading back home to America, but alas, I ran out and had to find a way to restock.<br /><br />You may have noticed that you can get a 5 lb bag of many Haribo candies for less than double the price of this item, which is a great value, but is not advisable if you are like me and do not trust yourself with that much delicious candy being in your presence at one time. This 1.5 pound bag is much more splurge-friendly (still unhealthy, but less so). And if you have a Prime membership like I do this is a great deal, and I feel like this American packaging keeps the candy from melting as appears to be a common problem with the 5 pound bags.<br /><br />A pesar de todo, the low price makes this item a good choice if you want to try a great candy without commiting to a huge amount or resigning yourself to having to drive around the US in attempt to track this down in a clandestine candy shop.

review/summary: Natural Balance Dry Dog  Food is the Best
review/text: My 2 dogs were on pro plan when they became adult dogs there digestive system changed and they had problems pooping they strain when they had to poop and  my other dog kept scratching and licking her paws & feet constantly. I took her to the vet and he told me to give her beneryal which really didn't work and gave me penalog which didn't work for too long, the vet said it may be the food it was a process of elimination to find what was causing allergies and the problem with their digestion and why when my dog pooped it was a strain for her to eliminate. I decided to change the food I went online to see what kind of dry food I should buy there were so many to choose from which made it more confusing what to choose. My neighbor said she gives her dogs Natural Balance for allergies and digestion. I went online and checked out the food and decided to get grain free Limited Ingrdient Diet chicken w/sweet potato for small breeds and hoped this would help my 2 dogs. It didn't take long to see the difference they no longer strained pooping the scratching and licking are still there but not like it was. My dog seemed to be relief and seemed relaxed since the scratching & licking wasn't severe as before she was able to play without stopping to scratch every second. Both dogs skin and coat look better then it ever looked. They have been eating this food 4 months and I couldn't believe by changing their food that it could make such a difference. Both my dogs are happy and if they're happy so am I.<br /><br />Natural Balance has many dry foods to choose from like organic food, vegetrian food, special weight management and special food for the senior dog. The best thing about this food is puppies and adult dogs can eat the same food. You don't have to buy food for puppies only. I hope this is helpful to those who can't decide which brand is best. Try Natural Balance check out the website to see all their products to decide which food is best for your best friend.<br /><br />My little babies are happy with their new food.<br />Suzan<br />Mesquite Nevada

review/summary: Still problematic for some dogs...
review/text: I know "Sweet Potato and Chicken" sounds very appealing (I wouldn't mind having that for dinner, myself), but if you're trying to look out for your allergic pet, please remember that quite a few dogs that are sensitive to grains and gluten are also allergic to chicken. As long as you're switching to a "Limited Ingredient Diet" (L.I.D.), you should really consider buying a product that uses a different protein source - like turkey, fish, lamb, duck, or bison. And be sure to watch out for "chicken fat" in the list of ingredients (a hidden source of the problematic protein).<br />The Dog Food Advisor website is a wonderful resource if you're interested in purchasing quality pet food for your companion. It rates every dog food on the market, and tells you what's right/wrong with it.  The website has helped me make much better decisions on behalf of my 4-legged family members.

review/summary: Simple and it works
review/text: I have 3 dogs and a foster dog and have had multiple other fosters over the past year.  My second dog was a rescue and came to me with a case of Giardia and persistent diarrhea for 4 months.  I tried countless types of food and realized she was allergic to Turkey, Apples, Peas, ect.  This food is simple and cuts out all the ridiculous, useless ingredients most commercial foods now cram into their kibble.  I give this to all my dogs and fosters and everybody tolerates it very well.  It is one of the only brands of food you can find that doesn't have 15+ ingredients in it and sweet potato is tolerated much better by my sensitive pup than brown or white rice or barley.  I do not feed them anything else.  If your dog is itchy, sneezy, or has weird poops...it is probably a food allergy (assuming they are dewormed and up to date on vaccinations!).

review/summary: EXCELLENT LIMITED INGREDIENT FOODS
review/text: I have two cockers, one of which is getting older. She developed blisters and spotting on her usually beautiful coat. She was scratching her skin off and licking constantly. The vet prescribed everything under the sun, antibiotics, special shampoos, special dog food, including a certain amount of sunlight daily. After months of testing, meds and specialties, including cooking her special diet,with nothing working,I decided to try a different approach and came across this dog food. Within a few weeks her itching had completely stopped, and her coat was growing back like silk. They liked every type of the sweet potato and chicken, fish, duck. With the fish and chicken being their favorite. No nasty food smells as others have reported. Have also purchased the same in the biscuits and they love those also, which surprised me. Have used the meat rolls in the duck and beef, loved those also. So this is the new way of life for us now. And when you break down the price for the larger bag as opposed to the Pedigree, etc, it comes out pretty good price wise. The vet bill alone was killing me anyway. The smaller bags will eat away at your wallet if you go thru dog food quickly. I bought those only as a try out. Their stools are solid, although I do not notice less waste as some report. And with free ship qualification on most orders, it makes it a little easier on the pocket book.

I took him to vets and after 7 rounds of medicines he still has soft poop. The vet has him on ID and I can't say that it works consistently, he still has soft poops everyday but now there are some poops that are normal. I was running out of the ID brand dog food and was going to go back to the vets to buy another bag for $40 and they were out so I went to the pet store and looked at what they had in the way of limited ingredient dog food. I saw this and bought a small bag to see if his poop improved or not. So I will let everyone know how it is once he's been on the food for a few weeks.

Just an FYI if you ARE ordering standard gumballs make sure they are the half (1/2) inch gumballs! The 1 inch ones are too big.

One of my dogs is generally very timid, but when he hears the crinkle of this bag he get's so excited and his little eyes light up like he's a kid on christmas.  it's so cute.  A little pricey but worth it.  Also the 'fries' are long.  The first time we were running low I thought to get out the scissors and make 1 treat into two or three.  They are still a decent sized when cut.  I bet you could train your dog to wash dishes with these promise of one of these treats.

Brand is "Beefeaters USA". After a few weeks my dog was vomiting, had bloody stool, and drinking a lot of water. Five hundred dollars later after xrays and blood panels he came back cancer-free and with nothing blocking his system.<br /><br />Puzzled, I googled some of the brands of treats I was feeding them, and information on the organic dog food I feed them. Beefeaters is made in China AND is on the list of tainted dog treats. Thinking it was only chicken jerky I did not think to check.<br /><br />I learned the hard way.

review/summary: I had to buy a big bag
review/text: My dog absolutely LOVES these things. I tried to switch brands and I bought one that was made in USA (bc of what i've heard about made in China products), but he wouldn't touch them. lol.<br /><br />I ended up buying the big ole bag of these. He is a very happy doggie right now. lol. Delivery was quick. Also, I didn't realize how much money I was dishing out for the extra small bag. It pays to buy big.

review/summary: beefeaters sweet potato fries, 2 lb bag
review/text: I totally agree with abbypomeroy. These are long fries. What I do is I cut these in half and stuff it in a kong toy. He acts like it's christmas every time I give it to him. Eyes light up and he sweep my floors with his tail. For $12/2 lb bag, this is a good buy. I have to have these in stock at all times. He craves for these.

review/summary: love them, but too pricey
review/text: My babies love these sweet potato treats, but $13 a pound is a little over the top. I thought I was getting the big jar AND the 2 pound bag for $26. I nearly fainted.

review/summary: Beefeaters Sweet Potato Fires- 2lb bag
review/text: I have two Shih Tzu dogs, Martini and Mailing.<br />This product is on recall, made in China and tainted. I ordered three 2lb bags,my dogs LOVE this treat (would rather have this than any other treat),but became very ill. A friend called to let me know what she thought was going on and sure enough, that was the problem. Took them off of the treat and it took a week or so for them to start feeling better.<br />I hope that is helps others.

review/summary: Beet Juice Tablets - Delicious and Nutritious!
review/text: I have been taking Sonne's Beet Juice tablets for about a year. I tend to be hypoglycemic, which  beet juice is supposed to help with. I do muscle-testing (Applied Kinesiology)to determine if I should take them and the dosage. Almost always, the results are that I take 2 per meal, 3 meals a day. I do other things, too, to handle the hypoglycemia. At this time, I'm barely aware being hypoglycemic, so I just continue to take the beet juice. Seems to be a successful action and my muscle-testing is telling me that my body likes it. I find them delicious, too!

review/summary: Kasilof Smoked salmon
review/text: This was a steal on sale, under $1/oz. Not quite what I expected, it was on the mushy side. Not the best for presentation. There is a sticker on the back of the box with a picture that depicts a dry-smoked-looking fillet. This has a texture closer to canned. But that's the only reason it gets 4 stars. It's very tasty, and would probably make a great ingredient (and use the fluid in the pouch), although we ate it straight. In fact, I bought another box while it was still on sale.<br /><br />If you do want decent presentation, slide it out of the pouch carefully onto a platter, drain and blot dry, and preslice with a very sharp knife to minimize serving debacles. Still looks pretty impressive.

review/summary: Good taste. Cool box!
review/text: We bought this some time ago when it was on a super-sale here and finally got around to eating it recently.<br />Our expiration date was some time in 2013, so we had plenty of time to consume it after the initial purchase date.<br /><br />It's packaged in a vacuum-sealed gold foil/plastic 'envelope' that comes shipped in a very cool and very real wooden box.<br /><br />The taste was good, but not out of this world. Not overly smokey.  The meat was very moist tender.<br />I probably wouldn't buy it again unless it went on sale.

review/summary: fast delivery,
review/text: I bought this food for my 80lb Staffy Terrier. The food was shipped the same day I bought it and I recieved it within 3 days. The food however did not sit well with my dog, he usually does not have sensitivites to food but this food made him sick. I tried to ease him onto the food over a few days and it did not do much to help he was consistently sick until I changed his food
