This was the first time I bought the FunBites Beefhide Chews, and from the package displayed, or even the product page, It didn't give a lot of information about the size, but these chews are 5 inches in length, and approximately 3/4 inch in size, so these chews last a long time. They were a bigger package at a cheaper price than what I was buying for my dogs. I'm very pleased with them.

review/text: My dogs Abbey and Chewy love FunBites.  What I like about them is it keeps my dogs amused for hours while they chew on them.  The other reason I bought them was to help clean their teeth.  My vet says dogs live longer when they don't have tooth decay.  He said the more teeth they lose from tooth decay the harder it is for them to chew their food when they get older.  I always keep Funbites in our house.

review/text: Xantham gum is essential to any gluten-free baking. You can use guar gum but it just isn't as good. This is top quality product, and a little goes a long way. Most recipes only call for a teaspoon or two. An order of 6 8-ounce packages should last an average household two years (unless you bake bread twice a week, then it's only a year maybe :-) ).<br /><br />One caveat - this is a very fine dust and it is best handled carefully... unless you like a pricey haze of xantham around your kitchen.

review/text: This purchase was a random one; I had never heard of the product before but I was looking for some little Christmas gifts and stocking stuffers for my husband. Well, he is the grill master and when I came across these rubs I thought I'd give a couple a try. I am so glad I did! This Smoky Barbeque Rub is absolutely delicious!! A great smoky-sweet rub with just enough spices and a great blend of flavors. It grills up really nicely. We have used it on chicken and pork and it is just plain yummy. We haven't tried the other one (pork rub) yet but I am looking forward to doing so... This was a truly great find; I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Great Decaf
review/text: We discovered Lavazza coffee while staying in an upscale club in Chicago. The coffee maker in the room had Lavazza Gran Filtro as the choice. I was impressed by the coffee coming out of this little machine, but figured it was just the opulence of the place overwhelming my taste buds. Then I discovered a small Lavazza coffee shop nearby and the coffee was even better. My love for Lavazza coffee was born.<br /><br />But alas, too much caffeine makes me nuts. Could the decaf be any good? It is! The same smooth, slightly sweet, never bitter taste of Gran Filtro comes through in the decaf. We keep both the regular and decaf on hand and regularly get good reviews on the coffee we serve. I've stopped buying anything else.

review/text: We love dark roast coffee, so take that up front for this review. However, I was shocked to see I could subscribe & save Italian Decaf coffee shipped to my house for under $4 per bag. Then, I realized you only get 8 ounces per bag, which is half the grocery store size normal bags. Then we brewed it. I don't think it tasted bad, but even the smell of the grounds wasn't as fresh as other companies. And the flavor was pretty empty - it is so smooth that we found it almost flavorless.<br /><br />Also, this is a chemically decaffeinated product, and we find it is worth it to pay an extra $1 per bag and go for the Swiss Water decaffeination which is natural and not chemical.<br /><br />Anyhow, the flavor wasn't to our liking and we have moved on.

review/text: My husband is spoiled, or so he tells me. After this he can't find any other decaf he likes as well. He must be right. Every so often I'll make a cup in the evening and I don't really realize it's decaf unless I think about it. For someone who can't imagine getting through the day without coffee, it doesn't get much better than that.<br />For myself, having tried all the house brands (coffee bean & tea leaf being the best in that bunch) along with Gevalia and Illy, Lavazza has become the favorite. Gevalia was nice for the variety. For reasons I can't explain, Illy has become a backpacking tradition. Don't go without it, but don't have it many other times, either. Lavazza is the household daily.

review/summary: very delicious and easy soup mix
review/text: I found this jar of  Tamarind soup base in a Vietnamese market here in Northern Virginia because I could not find the tamarind paste in my local asian store.<br /><br />I just finished making a small pot of 3 cups water to 2 tbs or so (to taste) and added edible taro stem (warning - you MUST MUST MUST get the edible taro stem from a Vietnamese market!!! There are many poisonous varieties of taro stem due to calcium oxalate - that are irritating and potentially hazardous to your health that are sold elsewhere that require very hot long boiling with salted water then drained and even then I am not sure it is safe...) with tomatoes and green onion and catfish.<br /><br />I once had this soup years ago from a Vietnamese friend and she used the tamarind paste instead.  This powdered soup mix is the closest thing to real tamarind paste and has a very delightful tasting salty and sour taste that feels so refreshing for summer!<br /><br />Basically, you just add this sauce to water, add the catfish and bring to a boil then simmer till the catfish is cooked. Then you serve it by putting it in a bowl, add the chopped tomatoes, and eat it with Jasmine rice. You can also substitute fish ball (made of fish cake - found in Asian markets) or shrimp, any seafood. I love it with shrimp.<br /><br />I was amazed at how realistic this soup tasted to what I remembered. Highly recommended. Too bad they don't just sell one container at a time instead of having to buy in bulk quantities as one jar will go quite far for the occasional Gourmand.

review/summary: Tasty Red Palm Oil
review/text: Red Palm Oil is a wonderful, healthy, tasty addition to a low carb diet.  If you are searching for a new healthy fat to use in your meal preparations, in addition to the coconut oil you are already using, then Red Palm Oil is for you.  The bright orange color comes from the abundant caratinoids in the red palm fruit. It is also rich source of vitamin E, and CoQ10.<br /><br />It adds a wonderfully unique flavor to egg, meat, and fish dishes.  I typically like to blend red palm oil w/ coconut oil for pan frying salmon, or grilling meat or poultry.  It also works well in chili recipes.<br /><br />Red Palm Oil is difficult, if not impossible, to find in retail grocers, including the large, organic, health food grocer.<br /><br />Even though this oil is widely used throughout the world, being produced in countries such as, West Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, and South America, it must be a scarce import to the USA.  Why else would the price for this oil be so expensive?  When you add $10+ shipping cost to the $14+ retail cost, that's EXPENSIVE! for 16oz, relative to other healthy cooking fats like olive and coconut oil, or butter.<br /><br />I've tried both the Okonatur and Omni brands sold by Amazon, and while both are good, I prefer the Okonatur.  The Okonatur red palm oil seems to smoke during frying a little more readily than the Omni brand, which may be due to a different fatty acid profile, however, the flavor characteristics of the Okonatur are more pleasant to my palate.<br /><br />For price comparison purposes, I have purchased a 16oz jar of Okonatur Red Palm Oil for $18.99 retail (San Francisco, CA) That, vs the $28.00 it will cost on Amazon - not a difficult choice to make.<br /><br />Bottom line: Buy Online if you can't find it locally - but give red palm oil a try.

review/summary: Excellent, Awesome Product
review/text: This is great red palm oil.  Even though most people are using it to cook with, the health benefits are much greater if you do not heat it.  It is great in a salad.  Use with organic vinegar, salt, cayenne, and other spices you would like as a dressing.  CoQ10 is destroyed upon heating, so cooking is a terrible way to get the health benefits.  Also, the vitamin E is destroyed upon being heated.  This product also contains an extremely high content of vitamin A, which is also destroyed upon heating.  The one user who described his birds appearance glow after using this product must have fed it to him right out of the jar, without heating it.  Even though cooking with is occasionally is okay, remember that almost all of the time, it is much better to eat it raw (unheated).  This is one of the truly great raw foods which is loaded with, as far as I am concerned, the most beneficial combination of nutrients that every body needs.<br /><br />The Okonatur Red Palm Oil is Extra Virgin and Organic.  It has all of the characteristics that Red Palm Oil should have.  It remains solid in cooler temperatures, but becomes liquid at slightly higher temperatures (well below cooking temp!!)  A hot day will cause the oil to become liquid.  The color is a deep reddish orange, which means that all of the nutrients that I described above are present.  The pungent taste comes from the way the palm fruit tastes.  The pungent taste is also an indication that this product is fresh and pure.  If Red Palm Oil tastes bland, it is a sign that it is not fresh, and the beneficial nutrients are missing!!  I personally would never cook with it, as my body seems to need all of the nutritional benefits derived from eating it raw.<br /><br />This is a company dedicated to delivering a product with all of the nutritional benefits intact.  They are not concerned with just making a quick profit.  I can tell by the way they take care to deliver the very highest quality Organic, Extra Virgin Red Palm Oil that they care deeply about their customers.  I thank God for people dedicated to the health of their customers, rather than dedicated to lining their pockets with gimmick products.  I can tell you, this product is truly a winner.  I can assure you that this is one company where the owners as well as the employees eat their product.<br /><br />Try eating it raw, (i.e., uncooked), and you will see great improvements in your health.  It is truly packed with nutrition and health.  Everything from your eyes to your hair to your attitude to your energy to your sleep and more will improve upon eating this Red Palm Oil the correct way.<br /><br />It has been my great pleasure to have found such a wonderful product, as well as a great company to purchase it from.  Don't just take my word, eat it raw and you will write the same raving reviews I just did!  An extremely satisfied customer!!!

review/summary: Supposed to be healthy; Taste is Gag.
review/text: I heard all about red palm oil from an Underground Wellness blog-radio show. It sounded really healthy with all the antioxidant and Vitamin E tocotrienols, so I decided to give it a try.<br />Here is first experience with red palm oil:<br /><br />The oil looked somewhat like a more viscous tomato paste and then the smell hit me. It didn't smell like something I wanted to eat. I tasted a little bit and found it to be an indescribably bad taste - somewhat like when you throw up a little bit in your mouth. I kept an open mind and used it to cook some everyday items like meat and eggs. The oil smoked almost right away over heat. I was rather disappointed in that, but someone else said they experienced the same thing and that it's not supposed to do that. The food I made with it gained the flavor of the palm oil, unfortunately, and it was rather strong.<br /><br />I'm thinking that when you use it, you need to put it in dishes that will overpower it with strong spices and other flavors. If anybody has any suggestions on complimentary cuisine, I'd appreciate it. I still think the health benefits outweigh the bad taste, so I want to keep using it - just sparingly and in dishes that overpower it.

review/text: As you open the tab, the aroma wafts up and tantalizes your nose.  The flavor is beyond any other broth you have tasted.<br /><br />I discovered this broth years ago, and in vain have I tried to duplicate it.  The closest method was to add some chicken drippings to a base made from roasted chicken wings and vegetable broth.  Imagine Foods Organic Free Range Chicken Broth is better than my mom's chicken broth, and she was an award winning cook.<br /><br />Even though the price has gone up recently, and I run towards extremely thrifty, I still buy it.  Once you try it you simply can't be satisfied  with any other chicken broth.  Add any chopped veggies and chicken, pasta or grains if desired, and you have a superb soup.

They are also slighty larger than their store bought counterparts. definately more bang for your buck here!

review/text: First of all, I was under the impression that this gum contained Stevia.  After getting it, I saw it does not.  It doesn't have aspartame in it, but it does have Manitol, etc.  Secondly, if you have tried nicotine gums, this is the consistency...it comes in the same packaging  as nicotine gum, and it's tough to open and tough on the fillings.  I think now I need a few old fillings replaced after chewing several pieces over a week's span.  Thirdly, if you write to the email address on the gum package, they don't answer you.  I wrote to them twice over a week's period of time with no response.  I wanted to know, since ONE piece contains 25% of the daily requirement of vitamin A, what if you chewed several pieces in a day, every day,--would you reach toxic levels of Vitamin A in your body?  Well, I guess I don't need to know that now anyway, because it is NOT a gum you'd want to keep chewing, as it is too tough on fillings.  I would not buy it again!

review/summary: Perfect for what it was designed for
review/text: This is a dental gum.  Don't expect it to taste like chocolate ice cream or something.  It's good for your teeth and is great at freshening your breath.  However it has one more awesome use for my purposes.  It contains sodium bicarbonate which buffers acid.  If you suffer from GERD or even worse LPR  this gum can provide some short term relief.  Your saliva naturally has some bicarbonate in it and this will add to that and periodically swallowing does wonders for my LPR symptoms.<br /><br />LPR causes sore throats and mouth due to acid reflux.  The mint form is cheaper, however mint relaxes your esophogeal sphincter and is a big no-no.  Cinnamon is supposed to help lower your blood pressure and doesn't have the same negative effect as mint in my experience.

Although I myself did not try the product, they have reported that although the saffron did product the lovely yellow color in the dish they had prepared, the flavor was not entirely "right".  This is a more affordable version of the more expensive saffron that can be used in a pinch but if you want the total experience, you will have to splurge for the better quality stuff. However, this saffron is still much better than the coloring agents found on supermarket shelves that merely reproduce the desired yellow tinge to dishes.

review/summary: An all natural hot sauce that compliments not overpowers..
review/text: When it comes to adding a little kick of heat to some wings, or seafood, pizza or even a burger I turn to a brand of hot sauce that has not let me down in over 20 years of using it. TABASCO. What makes me stick to TABASCO pepper sauce, for some added heat, is how it adds the heat. This hot sauce does not come across overpowering which will destroy the natural flavor of the food. Instead it adds a sweet "kick" to your food, giving it added flavor while spicing it up a few notches.<br /><br />This product contains Distilled Vinegar, Red Pepper and Salt. It is a very simple product that is all natural. TABASCO "Ages" their Hot Sauces in wooden barrels like one might age a wine. They re-use the barrels after a batch is done so with each batch the flavor continues to stay bold and get better and better.<br /><br />Is TABASCO for everyone? Probably not as it does have some nice kick to it. However if you are a fan of spicing up the food in your life there is no better brand to have sitting around the house. It works for almost every food product out there and I personally would say it has about a "MEDIUM" heat to it(2500-5000 Scoville units). 5 stars for a product that has stood the test of time for over 150 years<br /><br />**NOTE: If you are looking for a more "MILD" spice you should try the Green Pepper sauce. A nice sweet green pepper flavor with very little kick (600-1200 Scoville units)<br /><br />**NOTE: If you want a more smokey flavor with your spice, try the Chipotle pepper sauce. It goes great with BBQ or meats with a soft kick. "MILD-MEDIUM" heat (1500-2500 Scoville units)

Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tabasco Brand Pepper Sauce has set itself apart from the others.  It took me awhile to formulate my opinion of this intriguing, distinctive hot sauce.  It tastes like no other hot sauce that I have ever used.  In addition, Tabasco Brand Pepper Sauce is hotter than most hot sauces that I like, but I do not consider it to be an overpowering heat.  I have used it on a variety of foods; it tastes good on pizza, for example.  It is a good hot sauce to have around, and I recommend it.

New flavors have been added in recent years:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVIQV2">Green Pepper Sauce</a> (milder yet) (600-1200 Scoville Heat Units),<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOQI8O">Habanero Sauce</a> (hottest) (>7000 Scoville Heat Units),<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOQI6Q">Garlic Pepper Sauce</a> (milder) (1200-2400 Scoville Heat Units),<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002B1MUF4">Chipotle Pepper Sauce</a> (mild) (1500-2500 Scoville Heat Units),<br />Sweet & Spicy Pepper Sauce (mildest) (100-600 Scoville Heat Units),<br />but this is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZMOY">Orginal Pepper Sauce</a> (hot) (2500-5000 Scoville Heat Units).<br /><br />Dueling histories of the McIlhenny Company are available: (authorized) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0979780802">Tabasco: An Illustrated History</a> and (unauthorized) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060721855">McIlhenny's Gold: How a Louisiana Family Built the Tabasco Empire</a>, for those curious about how this most remarkable product and business empire came to be.<br /><br />Note: "A pharmacist named Wilbur Scoville invented the Scoville Scale in 1912 to measure the heat of peppers. A 'Scoville Unit' is actually a measure of capsaicin (the chemical in hot peppers that is responsible for their heat).<br /><br />Scoville's test was a comparative taste test that is considered subjective by today's standards. A more sophisticated method is in use today, but in honor of Wilbur Scoville, the unit of measure is still called the Scoville.<br /><br />The capsaicin level in peppers can vary from plant to plant due to local environmental conditions. This means that a pepper's rating is an average measure.<br /><br />The hottest pepper on record is the Bhut Jolokia with a pungency of over 1 million Scoville Heat Units (1,001,304, to be exact). By contrast, the Bell Pepper comes in at less than 100 Scoville Heat Units."

review/summary: blah....
review/text: I don't know what it is about Tabasco but it tastes more like vinegar than a hot sauce. It overpowers the foods with the acidic, vinegar taste which is not what I want. For example, if you put some on a pizza, it pretty much blocks the flavor of ingredients; olives, mushrooms, spinach, etc...  I want simple hot sauce with the taste of peppers and nothing else. I really don't know either why this thing is so popular, maybe because it's available everywhere and usually the only hot sauce available in restaurants.  Having bought and used other hot sauce brands, I will never buy Tobasco again.

review/summary: Well know but Far from the Best.
review/text: I've kept a bottle of Tabasco in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit. I've added a few drops to any number of dishes that I wanted to "kick up" a notch and used it regularly in a Bloody Mary.<br /><br />I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently.<br /><br />After taste testing over 30 sauces I have to say Tabasco turns out to be one of the worse. Tabasco's only two tastes are hot pepper combined with a very heavy dose of vinegar. You can do far better! The bitter vinegar after-taste is not an inherent quality of a hot sauce, as I long assumed.<br /><br />I could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco but here are just three that are widely available: Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, Cholula Hot Sauce, and Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce.<br /><br />Once you get away from Tabasco and its bitter vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are so many superior hot sauces that it is almost hard to comprehend. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market. While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original mix ---- that is not a "plus" in my view but rather a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw (a lot of vinegar) is a plus.

review/summary: best potato chips
review/text: I love these potato chips.  I've been eating Season's potato chips for years.  When I buy the unsalted ones, I add a little salt on my own.  They're cooked with peanut oil, which doesn't leave the slight aftertaste that many oils other than this and canola oil do, in my experience. These chips have a great mouth 'feel',light and crisp, not too hard or crunchy.  I highly recommend giving them a try.

review/summary: Michael Season's Ripple chips are a hit with wife!
review/text: We first discovered and bought Michael Season's at Fred Meyer because they are reduced fat and salt, and the taste and consistency are great. But FM stocks only Thin and Crispy and my wife wanted a sturdier version to use with dips. After getting product descriptions from the Michael Season's web site we discovered that they also make reduced fat and sodium Ripple chips. Found that Amazon had them in stock, ordered and received them promptly with free shipping. My wife says that she likes the taste as much as the Thin and Crispy and that the Ripple also stand up to using with thick dips.<br /><br />Also we found that Michael Season's are almost entirely whole chips, whether ordered online or bought from a store, unlike Frito-Lay. After I watched a Frito-Lay sales and stock person literally crush each bag of F-L chips apparently so that he could get more bags into the allotted space I could understand why. Michael Season's is a winner for several reasons. And with Amazon, the price per bag is lower than if bought locally.

review/text: As many have said, it is very difficult to find a chip that isn't loaded with salt and so much grease you need an entire roll of paper towels to clean up with after just a few bites. You can actually taste the potato these chips were cut from and because of the intense potato taste, you don't miss the salt.

review/text: These are the best chips ever!  They are unsalted and being on a low sodium diet critical in allowing my husband and I to eat chips.  They are all natural and low fat which is a great extra bonus.  Additionally they have the BEST flavor...you really taste the potato flavor and not the salt!  I would choose these chips over ANY chip on the market today, salted or not!! These chips as well as ANY unsalted chips are very hard to find in the stores so THANK YOU Amazon for selling them.

review/summary: Very Tasty Chips
review/text: I bought the Ripple lightly salted chips. I find that the chips are very good as other reviewers have said. I like that that they are lightly salted and it is still enough of a salted taste. The chips were not broken (any more than when you get them in a store) or crushed. They are packaged quite well for shipping. This is February and the expiration date on them is 6 months from now (Aug.). 12-8 0z. pkgs. to a box is a lot of chips but for those who don't know it, the chips can be refrigerated for quite a while, even past the expiration date, and still be as fresh and crispy as if just bought. I put extra crackers and cereal in the fridge too with the same results. I have a fridge in the garage so I can do this. I do recommend these chips.

review/summary: A great item to keep in your pantry
review/text: Hormel's Compleat line of shelf-stable entrees should be evaluated for what they are.  You're never going to get great texture or intense flavor from a "canned" product (and that's basically what this is), but manufacturers can create a product worth buying for certain needs, and Hormel has achieved this admirably.  Don't expect restaurant-quality or even frozen-dinner quality food here, but for what they are, they're great.<br /><br />The good things about the Compleat line:<br /><br />  *No refrigeration is required.  This makes Compleats ideal for your home emergency survival kit (you do have one, right?), camping, keeping on hand at work, or any other situation where refrigeration is not possible or practical.  It's also nice to be able to store some extra food that won't take up space in your freezer.<br /><br />  *The size (10 ounces) is bigger than many frozen dinners.<br /><br />  *They're easy to open.  The plastic "lid" (a tough sheet of plastic wrap that's firmly sealed to the edges of the bowl) is easy to grab, comes off in one piece, and would be practical for a child to open him/herself.  (A child of maybe seven or eight could handle this meal unassisted at school.  Be sure to demonstrate to the child how to safely pull the lid off [keeping hands away from the steam].  Don't try to pull both sides at one time; that's kind of hard.  Just pull off the lid one side at a time, going around the edge in a circle.)<br /><br />  *The container is boilable.  This means that if your power is out but you have a camp stove (be sure to do this outside), you can still cook these, even without a microwave.  This situation probably won't happen too often, but it's a good feature to have.<br /><br />  *The meal cooks quickly.  All of the Compleat entrees I've seen cook in 90 seconds.<br /><br />  *In a pinch, you could eat one of these unheated.<br /><br />  *Most of the varieties have a very generous amount of meat, driving the protein content to 20g or more for some of them, something virtually unheard of in frozen dinners.<br /><br />  *The taste of the Compleat entrees is nothing to write home about, but given the parameters of what this product is, they are not half bad.<br /><br />  *Most are low in calories.<br /><br />The bad things about Compleats:<br /><br />  *High sodium content (700g+ in most entrees), but you've gotta expect that in a canned food.<br /><br />  *Somewhat bland flavor and texture.<br /><br />  *Some of the entrees contain MSG.<br /><br />  *Not much in the way of vegetable content (but considering how mushy and awful canned vegetables tend to be, that's probably a good thing).<br /><br />Regarding the Chicken Breast & Gravy meal specifically, there is a huge chunk of tender, somewhat dry chicken.  Fortunately, the abundant gravy helps with that.  A generous base of mashed potatoes will fill you up.  This isn't a great meal, but for the price (I originally paid $2.76 at a grocery store), I'll buy this again to have on hand.  The meal has 21g protein, 210 calories, 24g carbs, 3g fiber, and 780mg sodium.  Contains MSG.

review/text: These are great. I've tried several different versions of the Compleats, but this one is my favorite. Not only is it the lowest in calories of the ones I like, but it's also the highest in protein and keeps me full the longest. My local Wal-Mart sells them for $2.00 each, which after tax, makes them a little cheaper than Amazon, but with the subscribe and save, it's only a little cheaper and it saves me the hassle of having to go to Wal-Mart, not to mention, they are out of this variety sometimes. I usually have one of these with one package of Ramen noodles. I eat at 11:00 a.m. and it holds me until 6:00 p.m. for dinner. I weigh 180 pounds and am fairly active while at work, walking around, lifting heavy things, etc. so if you're looking for something cheap, with a good source of protein and low calories, give these a shot.

I knew something was up when I started heating it and got this weird smell.  But when I took a bite --- oh my, it was a taste I've never experienced. I see why it's low fat -- there is nothing in it that remotely resembles actual food!<br /><br />Gagged on the first bite and threw the rest in the trash....far from my work office lest it stink up the room.

review/text: I'm always looking out for shelf stable foods that I can heat and eat in a hurry. I still haven't found it. I bought a six pack of these and I don't even think I'll donate the remaining five to a food bank. They're just that nasty. The flavor is, well, not chickeny. The chicken is rubbery something and not chickeny, either. The instant potatoes somehow have lumps and I'm pretty sure the gravy is just for color. Oh, man. I can't, in good conscience, give this to the dog to eat.

review/summary: Grainy and Tasteless
review/text: Despite the two good reviews on this product from others, I had to put my two cents in and make it known that this product isn't tasty.  Its texture is grainy (which isn't good for potatoes or chicken), the chicken was overly dry and salty, and the real turn-off was the flavorless "gravy."  I'm not a picky eater nor a connoisseur of fine meals, but if I had the option of eating this or starving to death, I'd starve to death.  Especially with a pack of six, I suggest you try it before you buy in bulk.  It really isn't palatable, IMHO.

review/summary: A delicious unsweetened addition to cereal
review/text: These are so good as an addition to cereal. They make unsweetened cereal much more appealing and tasty without being a sweetened product themselves. They are great for seasons in which fresh berries are out of season. They do stain the milk lavender, and if you eat them by themselves they will stain your teeth/tongue/fingers, but any dried blueberries would do that (unless they are coated with oil-yuck). This is no worse than wine or blueberry or acai juice.

review/summary: We love these!
review/text: My husband has been eating these on his Kashi cereal every morning for years. He loves them. They are so good for you, too! Great antioxidants. Easy way to add fruit into your day. Unlike the other 2 reviewers, he hasn't had any bad berries and hasn't had a problem with tooth stain.

review/summary: NO BUENO
review/text: I had to get a special order to return this item, because there was something wrong with the berries dude!  They were crusty and gross, unlike this product on a typical day which is crunchy and refreshing.  No bueno!

review/summary: Be prepared for a purple mouth!
review/text: I love that these are just natural blueberries. But my fingers turned inky black, and my teeth turned purple, my tongue black and the stain was hard to get off. Not like the fruit when it is not dried, that is easy to get off, this was not.! I ended up feeding this very expensive fruit to my pot bellied pig!

review/text: i used to work in a food service establishment that'd sell candy at the counter. anyways, we had this tub and quite frankly these fruit slices are disappointing. oranges taste good- they're tangy sweet, and orangy. well, this candy just has that perfumey orange essence as if you licked the orange and sweetness, nothing else much.

review/summary: Not as bad as the big sellers
review/text: Common brands of mayonnaise (Hellman's) taste horrible to me. Spectrum tastes better. 365 brand mayonnaise (which is also apparently distributed by Whole Foods Market) tastes even better than Spectrum. Spectrum comes in glass (which can break), 365 in plastic. Of course, both glass and plastic are recyclable. Usually, Amazon has very good prices, but this product has been given a much higher price than in the stores.

review/summary: We love Annie's Pasta
review/text: I got this pasta for my 14 month old and she loves it. I hated giving her the Kraft with all the extra stuff we don't need in it. I don't follow the directions very well though, i just put the milk and cheese in the pan with the drained pasta and so far no lump problems i just add a little extra splash of milk. Some times I put in a bit of plain yogurt instead of all the milk, it makes it nice a thick. I love the flavor because it compliments all the mix in's veggies, tuna, you name it. Plus the little peace shapes are toddler finger friendly. And my daughter finds the tie dye on the box pretty cool, it's hard to keep the boxes in my cupboards, they usually end up in a toy box. Overall we love the peace pasta, so yummy!!!

review/summary: Pasta for Peace
review/text: Annie's Peace Pasta is a delicious meal. Unlike the "Kraft in a Blue Box",it's made with all-natural ingredients. It's unique with its Parmesan flavor instead of the usual Cheddar. In a sense, it's like a vegetarian Carbonara (made without the bacon&parsley) or an Alfredo. The rainbow tie-dye packaging is gloriously psychedelic. Annie's Peace Pasta is perfect for lunch and dinner. It's filling. You can add veggies for color (it is pallid on the plate) It's feel-good food!
