I am not seeing this in other reviews.  Mine smell like coffee it is way over roasted.  I am a cook and grew up in a family of Gourmet cooks.  I am sorry and will return the oil.

review/summary: Not as strong as I wish
review/text: I love Amazon.  I do shopping here a lot.  It has all those hard to find stuffs.  I am a prime member and get free 2 day shipping service.  I shop at eBay too.  Whenever I saw something in eBay, I always check Amazon to compare price.  Most of the time, Amazon is cheaper than eBay since there is no shipping charge for me.<br /><br />I am trying to make natural hazulnut flavored coffee. I put a few drop in my coffee, it has very light halzul nut taste.  I have acid stomach.  My doctor told me to cut caffine and coffee since there is acid in coffee.  I found some swiss water processed low acid decaf beans (I always use bean and grind them before I make coffee.)  I can drinking coffee and not having stomach aches now.  It is just hard to find hazul nut flavored low acid swiss water processed coffee.  I have been searching the web trying to make my own hazulnut flavored coffee.  It said spray the coffee bean with hazulnut oil before toasting them.  I did not try to use it yet.  I will try sometime in the future when I have the mood.  I am just afraid this is not strong flavor to make the coffee.  Wonder if anyone tried.<br /><br />I read someone use this hazulnut oilto make salad dressing and cooking.  Since I love crumbled blue cheese for salad dressing.  Instead of using olive oil, I tried this halzul nut oil.  It taste great!  My acid stomach hates vinegar.  Most salad dressing has vinegar.  The hazulnut oil make the blue cheese more flavorable.  I will try it for cooking too.<br /><br />Oh, one thing.  The package came in perfect condition. The dent in the cans must happened before shipping.  It is possible the whole lot are dented.  I don't mind since I am using it myself.

review/summary: Just not effective
review/text: I purchased this to electrify a section of fence that was separated from the rest of my fence plan. I took the first one, installed it on the post, inside a box. I hooked up the fence and the battery and.....nothing.  I unhooked the controller and used the tester and it only gave an extremely weak reading.  No big deal, every manufacturer is capable of putting out a dud.<br /><br />Being smarter this time around, I plugged the replacement into the wall and checked it with the tester before installation.  Guess what--very weak reading again. What are the chances of two of them being bad?  I figured maybe my tester was bad, so I bit the bullet and touched both prongs. My tester wasn't bad.  Either I got two duds, or they're just not strong enough to get the job done.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm not trying a third unit.

review/summary: Excellent Chocolate Bars with AMAZING Buttery-Like Caramel...
review/text: The Ghirardelli Caramel bars aren't my favorite, but the quality and consistency of the chocolate itself is good, plus the buttery-sweet, toffee-like caramel is a major plus in my book.  I bought at least 10 of these bars in local Walgreens when they were on sale and loved them so much that I had to buy them here on Amazon.com.  Well, after buying 10 more on Amazon and having eaten about 3 of them I can honestly say I am fresh out of " love " for these chocolate bars cos like the old Bryan Adams song says, " Thought I Died And Went To Heaven ", I INDEED WENT TO HEAVEN WITH THESE BARS ALL THE TIMES I BOUGHT THEM BUT NOW I WANT TO BE A BAD BOY AND GO EVERYWHERE ELSE ( like Meat Loaf says ), so I've been trying out other chocolate bars.  However, if you are a premium chocolate fan you owe it to yourself to try Ghirardelli Milk and Dark chocolate, and some of their other varieties too.  THESE ARE HEAVENLY, BUT BE FOREWARNED:  OVERLOAD IS IN YOUR FUTURE WITH THE QUALITY OF THIS CARAMEL CONCOCTION!

review/summary: Heavenly Action
review/text: This is the best caramel/chocolate combination I have ever tasted. The caramel is liquid and complements the Ghiradelli chocolate perfectly. Do not try this brew if you are attempting to lose weight - you will end up an addict like me.<br />  The Ghiradelli product is far better than the Caramello/Hershey product in every way. The Caramello chocolate lacks the refined taste of the Ghiradelli squares, and the Caramello caramel is harder and not as sublime in taste. Comparing the two is like comparing Warren Buffett to myself in terms of wealth. Unfortunately I am the Caramello bar in this regard.<br />  At the very least try the Ghiradelli.

review/summary: Tasty, Easy, and Low Carb
review/text: I received this as a Christmas gift. I am a low carber and I'm always looking for treats that can make me feel like I'm not on a diet. Each packet is 4 grams of carbohydrates.<br /><br />Even though it's partially sweetened with Splenda, it doesn't have that bitter Splenda aftertaste that so many sugar-free drinks do. The cappuccino isn't very sweet, though, so if you're like me, you might want to add a splash of a sugar-free syrup. I use sugar-free french vanilla.<br /><br />What's great about this coffee is that, even in cold liquid, everything mixes well.<br /><br />I like to pour about a quarter of a cup of heavy cream, a splash of sugar-free French Vanilla, some ice, and then the packet all into a blender and grind for about 30 seconds. The consistency is almost milkshake-like. If you want to be really decadent, put some whip cream on top and frost your glass ahead of time.

While the taste may not be as good as the offerings from you local espresso stand it isn't bad and doesn't seem to have the chemical aftertaste of some other sugar free drinks.  The powder dissolves pretty well although it will leave some noticeable residue if it isn't stirred a couple of times while you are drinking.

review/text: Okay, people.  I just don't get it!  How can this stuff be getting five stars from so many people?  Do they know what coffee is SUPPOSED to taste like?  Yuck, yuck, and double YUCK!  This is akin to drinking dirty water!  I've even doubled the pods to try to get a richer cup...to no avail.  What taste it has is horrible...not that there is much taste at all!  I will struggle through this case and never buy it again!  All I wanted was a cup of decaf in the afternoon or evening...a GOOD cup of decaf!  Is that too much to ask?  Apparently so!  I wouldn't recommend this stuff to my worst enemy!  Again, I say YUCK!<br /><br />Also, my tummy's reaction is such that I suspect there is gluten in the packaging of the pods...perhaps in the glue?  I contacted Senseo to ask about it and they wouldn't give me an answer to my question unless I filled out a questionaire that would give them tons of information about ME!  Forget it!  That made me even more suspect!<br />I can't say for sure that there is gluten hiding somewhere.  It is only a suspicion created by an all too familiar IBS reaction.<br /><br />Buy this stuff at your own risk, or, if you enjoy drinking weak coffee that looks and tastes like dirty water.

review/summary: Senseo Pods generally good
review/text: We have a decaf drinker and a regular coffee drinker in the house, so we have preferred the pod brewers for some time.  Basically, we have been pleased with the Senseo coffee pods.  They make a quite good cup of coffee.  Only downside I see is that a full cup requires two pods where, for example, Melitta required only one.  Haven't worked it out but I think that makes a cup of coffee a bit more expensive with the Senseo machine and pods.  That's a small price to pay (no pun) given the fact that the machine for the Melitta pods repeatedly failed and had to be replaced quite often. *** Update - February 2012.  Last order had two bags with pods that were not correctly sealed and spewed coffee grounds throughout the bag.  To make it worse, in each bag there were at least three defective pods.  This increases the cost of a cup of coffee considerably (over 15%).

My coffee maker takes 50 mm diameter pods so the Senseo pods cannot be used on my machine.  The best pods that I can use are the ones made by Starbucks.<br /><br />Amazon will not allow these to be returned because I had to open one of the packages to find out the diameter was too large to be used in my pod coffeemaker. Nowhere in the description of the Sensio pods did it mention their diameter.<br /><br />On all of the coffee pod products, Amazon should require the diameter of the pods to be specified.

review/summary: Senseo Decaff. Coffee Order
review/text: After years of using Senseo Decaffeinated Coffee Pods I suddenly found it difficult to purchase them from several supermarkets where I shop. I decided to check this product out on Amazon and found a wonderful offer of automated shipments on a monthly basis or as per need.  I ordered six bags and paid no shipping fees!  What more can I ask for!  I was very pleased with this transaction!  :-)

review/summary: Current orders of Senseo pods
review/text: I really like my Senseo coffee pots and up until recently, I have been very pleased with Senseo coffee pods, too. I buy quite a few cases every year and have been for over 5 years.<br />But, recently I have been receiving lots more packages with more than 1 pod improperly sealed so that there are lots of grounds in the bag that make all the other pods messier to use - and you are unable to use the mostly empty ones. When I finally reached someone at Senseo, (on my 3rd attempt), they were very apologetic, but I've yet to hear if there is any explanation or will be any efforts on Senseo's part to improve this.<br /><br />This is very discouraging, since it is a good product - but now I dread opening a new bag. I have purchased some Eco-pods to fill myself in case the situation with Senseo's coffee pods does not get corrected. These you just fill with bulk coffee that I'll buy in the grocery store.

The rep was wonderful and sent a replacement order the next day! However, the original offer was for four of these units, but at check out, it only listed one unit. So, although I THOUGHT I would be receiving four such units, I only received ONE. I could have purchased these at my local grocery store for the same price and saved the shipping costs.

Of course, the coffee should be poured into small espresso white cups to be totally satisfactory. The Decaf is very good, and you wouldn't notice the difference with, e.g., the Medium. I recommend both the Senseo machine and the coffee in pods, for being very practical, efficient and taste approved.

As it stands, this is the one and only decaf offering from Senseo. I have to make my own pods if I want something different (not hard to do, and cheaper, but I do like the convenience of the pre-made pods).

review/text: If you're used to drinking coffee from beans that are somewhat freshly ground, then the coffee made from these pods will taste stale and flat to you. Also, the "crema" is beyond real creme--it's more foamy, and we don't enjoy it. After trying some gourmet pods that are marginally better, we've now ordered the refillable Ecopods so we can try using fresh coffee in the machine. We hope this works or its back to our expensive coffeehouse habit (double americano in a very small cup, please) for a while.

review/text: Coffee pods are not the cheapest way to make coffee and they are increasingly hard to find and can be expensive. We like them because we can make one or two cups at a time.  These Senseo pods are the best decafe coffee pods we have tried but still not as good a regular brewed cup of restaurant decafe coffee.  We buy and use the Senseo pods but have a Home Cafe double cup coffee machine. We don't have the Senseo machine.  The Home Cafe pods are next to imposable to find and more expensive.  The Senseo pods work fine, and as stated here make a decent cup of coffee.  In addition Amazon is the best place to buy these pods.  We checked a lot of on-line sources and no one we found beats their price. Plus they frequently offer free shipping when you buy them in the case quantity.  The other types of Senseo pods we tried, the regular and flavored coffees are good as well. We recommend that you try the Senseo brand pods, and purchase them from Amazon.

review/summary: a happy coffee lover
review/text: After years of basically having to give up morning coffee because it made no sense to brew a pot of coffee for one person (I hated rushing around, and then having to throw most of it away), I discovered the Senseo approach to single cup brewing. So I have joyfully returned to my morning cup of coffee. It's a great treat. Even on very busy mornings, there seems to be time for a cup of coffee. Love it!

review/text: I just love the Senseo coffee maker and pods. You practically don't have to be awake to brew a perfect cup of java every morning! I can make the fully leaded for myself and the decaf for my husband without dirtying pots, finding filters, and using anything but our coffee cups! And it's perfect every time. They are just great for that afternoon cup when you're on the go. Love my Pods!

review/text: Before ordering this from Amazon, I checked all my local sources for pods for my Senseo...Walmart, Target, local grocery.  Amazon's price was either equal to or below all the others, plus some sources didn't even have any decaf pods, which is the only kind I use.  When it's time to order again, I will come back to Amazon.  Quite satisfied with this purchase.

review/text: I ordered this product with the assumption that I would receive the coffee flavors pictured on the box. I only received the Jamaica me Crazy flavor. Not my choice of flavors in coffee with a hint of coconut. The coffee is okay but, not what I believed I was ordering. I would've ordered just the flavor I received if that was what I wanted... I kept the coffee, didn't feel like dealing with having to return it so I'm offering it to my friends when they visit. Disappointed with this delivery.

I also buy the weight management ones and the hip and joint ones and do the same thing. They are good for them and what a wonder, they are made in the USA! With real meat and fish, no worry about contents they are good. Your dogs will love them.

review/text: It made it challenging when our beagle puppy did not take to liking biscuit treats very well when training her,so we grabbed these inexpensive treats to try. She LOVES them and has trained very well with them!  She loves the salmon ones the most. I love that they are sooo inexpensive and one bag can go a long way! I also like the reclosable bag they come in bc they are stinky. The little heart shape is such a perfect size, but we actually trained her by breaking them in half. They are of good substance and hearty enough that  just a few are of great satisfaction to her.

review/summary: "VISIONS OF SUGARPLUMS"  ECLIPSED  BY  CHOCOLATE !
review/text: For Christmas gatherings, most family members expect tradition in the 'candy department' as well as "what we've always done" when it comes to decorations, carols & menus. Amazon.com can help in the hunt for the thinnest ribbon candy (B000CEA2CU), for nonpareils with sprinkles in holiday colors (B000AP7328), and for those chocolate coins in gold net bags (B0007TZVZI) so loved by kids. But how about 100% Vermont Maple Leaf candy, and Tully's (incomparable) Peanut Butter Fudge?<br /><br />To correctly celebrate the holidays, some insist on having today's version of the Droste (Dutch) chocolate apple: It is Terry's (made in England) sectioned orange, preferably dark chocolate. Lucky is the person chosen to give the solid ball a WHACK on the counter top while everyone watches it fall into slices! They are hard but,  OH, so delectable!<br /><br />Do you have memories of sprawling on the floor, playing "Candy Land"? Do you long for the marzipan or Turkish Delight of your "Christmas Past"?  OR other vaguely remembered delights? If you have lived long you may have experienced struggles with chocolate that now can be set aside upon learning that our favorite, tantalizing (dark) chocolate is beneficial for persons with high blood pressure! Start the New Year right with your very own "TERRY's ORANGE" - fav substitute for Vitamin D.<br /><br />mcHAIKU rejoices that CHOCOLATE  STILL  REIGNS !!

Yes they are high calorie but less than the high sugar cereals a lot of people eat for breakfast.  I stay away from fast food, etc..at least Bobo bar are oat grain.  I do plan to compare the caloric count to fast foods (maybe I should have a Sonic egg burrito instead?).
