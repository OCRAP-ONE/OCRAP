review/summary: My Dog Loves This Food!
review/text: My dog has never met a dog food or a "people" food that he doesn't like (with the exception of pretzels). So, getting him to eat has never been an issue. What is an issue with this food is being able to get out of the way fast enough after I fill his bowl and place it on the floor for him to eat. While he hasn't told me in a language that I can understand, my belief is that he seems to enjoy his Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor food almost as much as the "people" food my wife cooks for him.<br /><br />Besides the food's apparently good taste that my dog enjoys a lot, I like the fact that it has 23 essential vitamins and minerals, its meat pieces closely resemble pieces of steak in appearance and have a soft, easy-to-chew texture, and it has a pleasant aroma. While Chef Michael's has its fair share of soy and corn products, I'm satisfied that the Chef Michael's food provides my dog with a pretty well-balanced diet.<br /><br />All in all, I think your dog will thank you with lots of tail wagging and kisses after you start feeding him or her with Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor food. By the way, I have also given my dog the Chef Michael's Chicken meal, which he also liked a lot.

review/summary: Bag implies high-quality food, ingredients scream junk food
review/text: I think this dog food is a complete scam.  The bag claims "well-rounded meals for adult dogs."  This stuff is well-rounded only if you consider a fast food diet as a well-rounded diet.  Beef may be the first ingredient, but who knows what quality it is and it is directly followed by soybean meal, soy flour, preserved animal fat, brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest.  The list goes on of junk food for dogs with some artificial flavors and coloring added in also.  They are counting on pretty packaging with healthy claims distracting people from the actual ingredient list that contradicts those claims.  The feeding instructions say that you should feed your dog 1 cup for each 10 pounds of body weight, which means my 70 pound Lab would go through 7 cups of this junk food a day and at 22 cups of it a bag, would last her 3 days.  So this would not only be bad for her health but also bad for my wallet.  I can get a bag of quality grain-free food for her for significantly less than what it would cost me to feed her this for a month.

review/summary: The Illusion of Quality
review/text: Our dog was getting bored of his food, so we decided to give this a try. I was admittedly drawn to the "Chef Michael's" signature look of the bag. The higher price per pound seemed to lead me to assume that it contained dog food of higher quality than the typical grocery fare.<br /><br />Once this arrived, my dog DID enjoy eating it for a bit-just as I like eating a number of things that aren't good for me, and should eliminate from my own diet-or else suffer the consequences...<br /><br />However, the beautiful, brightly-colored packaging of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog food (made by Purina) could not hide the ingredient list.<br /><br />The most obviously bad ingredients that jumped out at me was "poultry by-product meal" along with added colors (Red 40, Blue 2 and Yellow 5 &6).<br /><br />Beef does not belong as #1 (highest amount of ingredient)*Note:"pink slime" is still listed as beef, even when fed to humans, which further erodes my confidence in the type/form of beef being used here.  Actually, this dog food is mostly comprised of SOYBEANS-as Soybean meal, soybean flour and soybean protein concentrate (listed #2, #3 & #5)., but is broken down into three different categories in order to make it seem like Beef deserves the top slot.<br /><br />I noticed a similar treatment regarding the use of corn (like soybeans, it's another GMO crop when not organic and also serves as a filler that's not great for dogs) is broken down to #6 corn gluten meal & #7 ground yellow corn. Another unhealthy filler for dogs Wheat-was also divided into ground wheat and wheat flour.<br /><br />I did learn a new term for #10, "Animal digest" - A material which results from chemical and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of clean and undecomposed animal tissue. The animal tissues used shall be exclusive of hair, horns, teeth, hooves and feathers, except in such trace amounts as might occur unavoidably in good factory practice and shall be suitable for animal feed. If it bears a name descriptive of its kind or flavor, it must correspond thereto.'<br /><br />Well, that's a lot of ingredients that scream "junk food!"My vet already told me to severely limit or avoid giving my dog such things. It will shorten a dog's lifespan by contributing to a number of illnesses.<br /><br />I did notice dried beans and potatoes buried in the ingredient list. I think a much better option for me is to boil him a potato and stick it in his dish along with his regular dried food every now and then.<br /><br />Update:<br />I forgot to mention that I didn't completely change his food-I only put a few of those rubbery bits that look like meat in with his other dry food to encourage him to eat his regular stuff. Even that little bit has made his stool VERY pale and the smell (that usually only has a mild odor) is now VERY STRONG!

review/summary: Dogs love it, but is it healthy?
review/text: My dog, a Chihuahua-schnauzer mix, loves this stuff.  She's not very big, so she can't eat much of it, but she definitely quickly learned to recognize the crinkle of the bag; she starts drooling like a regular Pavlov's dog and hits the bowl as soon as it touches the ground.  She prefers it to her usual dry food, Eukanuba, so I've taken to giving it as a treat.<br /><br />The state of her bowels after a few days on this stuff, however, leaves something to be desired.  Close inspection of the movements can tell a lot about the health of your pup and in this case the results were not inspiring.  Other reviewers have done a pretty good job breaking down the inputs to this product vis-a-vis health concerns; I can tell you that the outputs are equally suspect.<br /><br />Curious about this, I tried offering it to a variety of other critters.  Cats, crows, parrots and sparrows won't touch it, although a blue jay took a nibble at a meat piece - and rejected it in favor of the base kibble.  And our pet rats pretty much had to be starving to eat it - they made clear that they preferred absolutely anything else to eat.  Rats aren't super picky - they are straight up omnivores and they are pretty good at ferreting out nutritional value - so that concerns me.<br /><br />I was going to try some myself, but chickened out at the last moment.  I've taken a few bullets for Amazon reviews, but that was a bridge too far.<br /><br />In short, I don't mind giving this as an occasional treat that my dog absolutely loves, but it won't form the entirety of her diet.

review/summary: Can be a problem if your dog normally eats dry food
review/text: Technically this should be a 5 star rated product because dogs devour it.  But, it can be a huge problem if your dg is normally accustomed t more traditionl dry food.  It's almost as if this is like a kid eating too much candy.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, it's well made and dogs will like it - way too much.  So be careful; otherwise you'll have a problem transitioning back to regular dry food.

review/summary: My dog loves it. Calling it "junk food" is a bit extreme
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:40 Mins<br /><br /></span>I was dog sitting for a dog named Bulleit and I wanted to test out this product on her. As the video shows, she enjoyed it. She was moderately hungry at the time.<br /><br />Some reviews have labeled this as "junk food." That's a bit unfair. Feeding your dog potato chips and other garbage is worse.

review/summary: There are better options on the market...
review/text: I am in the process of trying to find the right mix of nutrition and taste for my two dogs.  In my opinion this dog food has ingredients that are not the best after reading up on nutrition for dogs.  I would not knowingly give my dogs something that might upset their stomachs like soy.  From what I am reading grains are not the best nutritional option for dogs and that is what this dog food contains.  I will not select this product again.  As I become educated about the different dog foods on the market I just can not feel good about feeding my dogs something that can possibly cause them health problems.

review/summary: Dog loves it and begged for more. I'm questioning some ingredients.
review/text: The first ingredient is Beef! That I like not corn as so many are. It has no artificial preservatives which I like. It does have some items like animal digest, poultry by product meal, which can come come from dead or diseased animals I do believe.l.He loves the semi soft beef and the crunchy green beans and potatoes. He is served green beans with every meal as he has been on a weight loss diet. I think he could crawl in one end and eat this way out the other.That will not be happening.<br /><br />I don't want him to gain weight so I  mixed this 1/2 to 1/2 with Rachel Ray's Weight Control food which he loves also. That is what I did at this first meal and he picked out all the diet food and put on floor then ate the Grilled Sirloin. Later he went back and ate it all since I wouldn't give into more today. As it says on the package and I know when changing food always mix it with the old and do it over 7-10 days.<br /><br />It does have a lot of good vitamins which he was not getting, but he was getting all pure food with no additives. I will let him have this as a treat now and then but not all the<br />time. I like his protein to come from chicken, lamb, beef and not boosted up with all kinds of mixed corn and soy meals, animal fats and such.<br /><br />It seems sad to me the the market plays to making the pet happy not healthy, grilled sirloin yea who doesn't want that and that is not in the ingredients, beef is number one but what part of the beef?<br /><br />My dog had 1 whole can of no salt added green beans a day as per his vet and his 1.4 cups of weight control food. He is healthy and happy and lots the 2 pounds he needed to over a 4 month period. That is huge for a Pom.<br /><br />So everyone can make up your own minds. What is more important something that tastes good or what is the best for the animal.

The ingredients, like so many other cheap foods on the market, include a lot of corn, as well as soy.<br /><br />If you are looking for a food that is appealing to dogs with the convenience of being sold at grocery stores, this will work for you.

review/text: The ingredients in this dog food contain soy and corn which have about the same nutritional value as sawdust. Don't be fooled by the fancy label or celebrity jerks who promote this food. Dogs are not meant to eat grain (a little oatmeal or brown rice is sometimes okay). Typical of Purina dog foods, this is full of artificial dyes and cheap fillers. They get away with it because too many dog owners don't bother to look at the ingredients or educate themselves on dog nutrition. A dog who has constant gas or eats their own filth is not normal. A raw diet is best for dogs, but there is some decent kibble out there like Orijen, Natural Balance, and Merrick. This one is for the trash heap.

review/text: There are several independent sites online that provide critical reviews of various dog foods.  Chef Michael's consistently receives the lowest rating possible.<br /><br />The main problem with this food is the numerous poor-quality ingredients.  Unspecified animal fat?  This can be restaurant grease, slaughterhouse waste, diseased cattle, etc.  Corn?  Hard for dogs to digest and of little nutritional value.  Poultry by-product meal? A dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste that is not fit for human consumption, made up of things like beaks, feet, and feathers.<br /><br />Ignore the pretty packaging and the image of "Chef Michael" (who?) lovingly preparing your dog's meal in his kitchen.  This is stuff scraped up off the floor and pressed into bits.  Fido deserves better.

The problem with this review is that I never received the product.

We're very picky about the quality of dog food we give our dogs and have, for several years, been feeding them a raw meat diet that we get from a company called Darwin's Natural Pet Products. So even though our dogs didn't actually try this product, it's safe to say that I would not have given it more than three stars anyway.

review/summary: Still uses a lot of low quality ingredients
review/text: I decided to try this food as part of the Vine Program for my schnauzer.  Manufacturers can say anything they want and the burden of proof is on you (the consumer).  In the end, what you choose to feed your dog boils down to whether the dog likes the food, the food's nutritional content and ingredients and the track record of the dog food manufacturer.<br /><br />I recently reviewed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>, and this product contains a slightly better ingredient list.  However, the first ingredient is beef, followed by two fillers--soybean meal and soy flour, and the questionable tallow preserved in Vitamin E.  The rest of the ingredient list is similar to Beneful with respect to the other fillers: corn gluten meal and ground yellow corn and other unmentionables such as the ubiquitous poultry by-product meal and animal digest.<br /><br />As I said in another review, my schnauzer would eat almost anything, and this food was no exception.  Although I'm happy to see a reduction in the bad, bad things that are in Beneful, there are still plenty of fillers and potentially allergy inducing ingredients in this food.  I cannot in good faith recommend this food.  As with all dog foods, I recommend reading the labels on several different products if the ingredient list is something that bothers you (and I contend that it should).  While you will usually pay a little more up front for a quality dog food, the payoff will be increased longevity, vigor and vitality.

When I filled my shih tzu's bowl with this, however, he simply looked at me, down at the bowl, gave it a sniff and walked away.  Granted, he is a very very very picky dog.  So far the only dog food that I have found that he really loves is Purina Beneful.  I have tried giving him this a couple of times and none of the times has he taken any interest in eating it.  Our cats, on the other hand, have nibbled on it and they don't seem to mind it.  I think this will end up going out to our big outside dogs - they love and eat anything, lol.  Bottom line, I will not be purchasing this in the future.

review/text: I have a 12-year-old finicky beyond belief Shih-tzu and for the first time in her life I have found a dry food that she really likes. Well, she really likes the chewy meat shaped pieces. The crunchy green and yellowish kibble-like bits were not as appealing to her. In fact, I found myself picking up those pieces off the carpet because she takes a big mouthful from the bowl, then spits it all out and selects the pieces she wants to eat. The remainder is left on the floor for me to clean up.<br /><br />That said, in 4 out of 5 days of feeding, Lily has chosen the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food over her favorite wet, canned food. I have been searching for years for a dry food that she would eat. You have no idea how many bags of food I've dropped off at the local animal shelter because Lily turns her nose up at everything...especially dry dog food. It looks like Chef Michael has cooked up a winner. This will be our go-to dog food from here on out. Or until Lily decides she doesn't like it anymore.

review/summary: Dog Wolfs This Down and Need to Monitor the Intake
review/text: If you put a bowl of this in front of my dog, he will gobble the whole thing up - he really likes, it.  I'm not too sure that is a good thing as, for example, he usually is a self-regulated eater and eats when he is hungry vs. sitting down to what I would compare in human terms of a bowl of buttery popcorn.  I am now only giving him a small portion of this food as a "treat" every now and then and have put him back on his normal, healthier dog food.

review/summary: Sadie loves it, but it doesn't love her
review/text: Sadie is our three-year-old GoldenDoodle.  I won't say she's a picky eater, but occasionally she turns up her nose at food that's supposed to be good for her, like Iams.  I was tickled that she loves Chef Michael's -- eats every bit as soon as it's in her dish.  I even mixed it with some of her regular food and she managed to pick out the Chef Michael bits and leave the regular food.<br /><br />But in the eight days that she's been eating this, she's had several loose stools and two accidents in the house -- her first accidents in all the time she's been housebroken.  Sadly, this yummy food is off her menu.  I'm no vet but there's obviously something in Chef Michael's that doesn't agree with her.<br /><br />Update: We stopped giving Sadie this food and there have been no more loose stools, or accidents in the house.  It may not have been related to the food at all -- there's no way to know without trying it again.  It's too bad, because she really, really liked it.

review/summary: Danny likes it fine
review/text: I have a four year old sheltie.  He will basically eat almost anything.  So it's hard to tell exactly what he likes best.  He gobbled this up in his usual fast way and sniffed around the bowl in case anything fell out that he  missed, but of course he didn't find anything so I, being a bit indulgent, put a few more bits into his bowl and he happily<br />sucked them up, barely stopping to chew.<br /><br />Therefore, as far as taste goes, my dog liked these very much.  I must say that, some of the ingredients don't sound too great.  Lot's of corn and byproducts are included.  Danny's usual food is purchased from his vet, and includes both dry and canned food, along with meat and eggs several days a week and an occasional McDonald's cheeseburger, no pickles!<br /><br />I won't be buying this again due to the less than great sounding ingredients, but as far as Danny is concerned, it's just fine.

review/summary: Could barely get it out of the package...
review/text: When this arrived in the mail I started opening up the box it was shipped in and my dog was all over it, trying to get at it. It reminded me of Christmas when I get him treats in his stocking. I guess he thought it smelled very good. He was jumping around trying to see what I was opening. Once I fed him, he really ate it up. I am  happy to see him enjoy his food so much, as if it is a special treat instead of plain old dinner.

review/summary: The dog says it is delicious!
review/text: I received a 4.5 Lb. bag of Purina Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor and potato green bean garnish, well-rounded meals for adult dogs.  The package says that real beef is the #1 ingredient.<br /><br />The food is a mix of soft red dyed pieces and hard yellow and green dyed pieces.  The protein count is 28%, fat 16% and fiber 3%.<br /><br />Beef is the first ingredient, then soybean meal, soy flour and soy protein are all ingredients that are appropriate protein.  Brewers rice is the small pieces left over after the husk is milled.  Questionable ingredients include animal fat, which could come from anywhere, corn and corn gluten meal, poultry by products, the parts of poultry that are unfit for human consumption, and animal digest, again parts of any animal that is unfit for human consumption.  They also added food coloring, food dye.<br /><br />My dog is spoiled.  Her food is kept in a container in the pantry and anytime she gets hungry she goes in and paws the container to tell me that she is hungry.  With this food she has been asking for extra servings of food.  It isn't good to switch a dog to a new food so I mixed it with her regular food, but she loves it. She has had other soft type food and has not has this reaction to it.<br /><br />I keep my dog on a natural dog food without the questionable ingredients that Chef Michael's contains so I will not change to this full time, but I will include it for a treat now and then.

review/summary: Tasty, Enjoyable Morsels for Your Pooch Too!
review/text: Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food for adult dogs with potato and green bean garnishes is a hit with my dogs!<br />o The Crunchy kibbles and tender pieces appealed to them. They have taken to it very well and sought MORE PLEASE. ...This may be a cost savings compared to buying pouch or canned foods for mix-ins that encourage the dogs to eat less palatable offerings.<br />o Top 6 ingredients: BEEF, soy bean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with Vitamin E, brewer's rice, soy protein concentrate<br />...EXTENSIVE ingredient list...check the ingredients for items that cause your own dog problems.<br />o Product is a welcome addition to the Purina Dog Food range of products which historically contain corn as the main ingredient; a cause for digestion problems since it comes out pretty much the same as it went in.<br />...Haven't noticed any digestion or poop problems.<br />o Vitamin powder smell reminds me of when I had to add vitamins to my parents' show & hunting dogs' meals<br />...a positive addition.<br />o There are no artificial preservatives.<br /><br />o Prefer ziplock closure for the bag like some other dog foods.<br />o PRICE is moderatley MORE expensive @ $2.24 per pound.<br />...Let your budget be your guide IF this item is to be included in your dog's REGULAR daily menu. It will be an option but not an every day thing. EVERYONE in my house is belt-tightening!<br /><br />UPDATE 7/31/2012:<br /> 1. Using moist morsels as treats was very positive. Another reviewer shared the idea :)<br /> 2. Mixing Chef Michael's dog food with pooches' other dry dog food has them selectively picking out the moist<br />  morsels and eventually returning later to finish off the remaining grub ... too smart for their own good and<br />  lovable.

review/summary: They Loved It!
review/text: I have two dogs, a very finnicky pug and and an extrememly easygoing Airedale. Both of my dogs loved this food. They gobbled it up as soon as a I put it in their bowl. It have a very cool texture, real pieces of meat, and quite soft. This is a great attribute for older dogs who may have problems with their jaws or teeth. I actually use the meat pieces as treats for my dogs. They really love this food! The price is a little high, but it's worth it if you want your dogs to eat their food with no issues. My dogs used to turn their noses up at other dog foods I've poured in their bowls, but not this stuff! Both of them very happily ate it up! I was very impressed with this dog. Neither of the dogs had an gastro issues from this brand either, if you get my drift. We are very happy with Chef Michaels Grilled Sirloin Dry dog food.

review/summary: Max Gives It A Paws Up
review/text: My Dobie, Max, is as picky a dog as I have ever owned when it comes to eating his meals. I have tried most highly rated dry and canned food brands - Blue Buffalo, Wellness, Taste of the Wild etc. He refuses to eat any dry food unless I lace it with some chicken or beef or cheese to get him started. It is like priming a pump in that it takes just a small amount of what he considers a goodie to get him to usually finish his entire meal. Sometimes I would put some canned dog food in with the dry but he woud rarely eat it and after it sat there a while I would have to throw it away. That was an expensive and wasteful way to go so I stopped.<br /><br />When I received the Chef Michael's Sirloin I placed a small amount in my hand and offered it to Max. He went through his usual routine when offered something new by giving it the sniff test, throwing in on the floor to thoroughly examine it and then, if he likes it, scarfing it right up. He then gave me the old "gimme more" look but I did not fall for it. I cannot say with any certainty whether this product is healthy or, as some have declared, just plain junk food. I can say that Max loves this stuff. I have no intention of giving this to him as a meal but rather as an occassional treat mixed in with his regular food. If I notice any adverse effects or if his poop is altered then I will discontinue its use. The bag says it is manufactured by Purina and gives a US address but it is not clear if the address is just for the location of Purina or whether the food is actually manufactured in the US. I doubt that the food is made in the US because other Purina products and their web site are very careful to shield any source information. I am particularly careful on what I feed Max because his predecessor died of poisoned food from China.<br /><br />If this is junk food that is harmless when consumed in small amounts and not often then so be it. Who among us can honestly say they never ate any junk food? I don't feel that my life has been ruined by an occassional journey into junk food land. Neither my vet nor I believe any harm will come to Max from giving him a treat every once in a while.

review/summary: Evidently tasty dog food, but relatively high cost; not exactly health food
review/text: I have for some years now been feeding my dog a blend of appetizing dog foods with a costly prescription diet for his medical condition. He doesn't always have much of an appetite, and it can be difficult to coax him into eating much. He won't eat the prescription diet unless there's something a little more tempting with it. I don't know; maybe once he gets started he doesn't pay as much attention to the individual elements.<br /><br />On opportunity for review, I picked this up along with a bag of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a> to see how these two foods would work for this purpose, and how they'd compare.<br /><br />Either of them does the trick. He was enticed by the smell of the Beneful before I even opened the bag. Put a few pieces on the floor, and he went after it like a dog in a dog food commercial. He gave pretty much the same attention to the Chef Michael's. He doesn't seem much to care which I put in the bowl with the prescription food; he has so far chowed down on each just as happily.<br /><br />Even allowing for the lower portion sizes of Chef Michael, it costs twice as much. Nutritionally, there are some differences between the pair. Beneful has 25% crude protein (minimum); 10% crude fat (minimum); 4% crude fiber (maximum) and a maximum of 14% moisture. Chef Michael has 28% crude protein (minimum); 16% crude fat (minimum); 3% crude fiber (maximum) and a maximum of 12% moisture. I've been doing some reading on dog food ingredients, and while I'm no expert what I've read suggests that the Beneful is heavy on carbs and, while its top protein source (chicken by product; second on the list) is a decent protein, it's not necessarily a highly digestible food due to its heavy reliance on corn. Chef Michael starts with beef. Corn is much lower on the list, but the second and third ingredients are soybean meal and soy flour. I'm told the first of these is mostly a filler, with little nutritional value, while the second loses much nutritional value being converted from grain to flour.<br /><br />That considered, I'm not sure that the Beneful would be my first choice for mixing in with my dog's food, although in the right proportion I feel comfortable enough with it. Chef Michael feels a little better, but is expensive and not necessarily a big nutritional win. With his tricky health, I don't think I would use either of these solely, but they both do the trick. While neither is exactly a health food, I can't pretend that everything I eat is the healthiest option, either. These are decent supplements, but I personally would not use them as mainstays.

review/summary: The dog loved it
review/text: I put a bowl of this out next to our dog's other food, also Purina brand.  The dog clearly preferred this food and finished the entire bowl.  I found the food odd looking -- instead of typical little chunks of kibble, this food had pieces that look like meat, with scraggly edges and such.  I have no idea if dogs care what their food looks like -- but they did seem to enjoy eating this.  I wish the bag had a zip-lock closure, but other than that, no complaints.

review/summary: For the doggie gourmet!
review/text: Forgive me ahead of time if this review gets into "too much information" territory, but yes, I'm going to discuss dog poop here. :-)<br /><br />I've had difficulty finding a dog food that:<br />a) my dog likes and<br />b) doesn't also cause what we call in our house...the dreaded Dog-arrhea!<br /><br />As a result of far too many clean ups - on the floor, on the carpet, on little dog feet, on our long-haired dog's posterior, I've stuck to a very boring but reliable kibble.  The result, she eats because she's hungry, but doesn't really enjoy it.<br /><br />Well, I can say that all that has changed!<br /><br />First and foremost, Chef Michael's dog food actually looks good.  Now, while I don't think the dog cares what the food looks like, it's still impressive for the doggie owner.<br /><br />Second, it actually smells good.  No dog food reek here.<br /><br />Third, the dog loves it.  From a dog who usually picks at her food, I now have a dog who devours her food.  LOL - as a matter of fact, I was awakened to the sound of the dog food bowl being pushed across the kitchen floor as someone looked for more food!<br /><br />And fourth and finally - the scoop on the poop!  I'm happy to say that the Dog-arrhea that usually comes with a change in food is non-existent.  Since I'm the one who has to scoop the poop before the gardener comes every week, let me just say that back yard clean up is a breeze.  And when the dog uses the pads on occasion, it's a super easy - and not at all smelly - clean up.<br /><br />So, with apologies for all the images this review may have brought to mind, but this is a really great dog food!

review/summary: Dogs gobbled it down.
review/text: My dogs gobbled the food up in no time, but honestly what animal will not eat a new kind of food that is placed in front of them that smells and looks like beef.  It even states in the ingredients that natural filet mignon flavor is used.  It looks appealing with dry kibble and some moist chunks. In the ingredients it states by- product poultry is used, but I like that fact that beef is the first ingredient listed which means it is he highest concentrated ingredient used.<br /><br />I had previously purchased the ridiculously highly priced "organic" dog food, but after a recent very large recall of a well known dog food brand that has many labels, I switch to Purina brands since they have NEVER had a recall of dog food.  They have had recalls of cat food but never dog food.  However, for a 4.5 pound bag for a Purina brand dog food you can buy anywhere I think it is a tad bit expensive.<br /><br />I have been feeding my poochies <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FVTQJQ">Purina Beneful Healthy Weight</a>, but I am going to mix things up and buy the large bag of Purina Beneful and a small bag of Chef Michael's and mix them up and feed them a smorgasbord every night.

review/summary: It looks pretty, but in the end not so much
review/text: I normally feed my dog a semi-premium brand called 4Health which I get through Tractor Supply Co stores and my dogs love that food. It's the usual "boring" food, all the same shape and color, little round brown balls. So when I opened this bag of Chef Michael's and put some in their bowl they loved it! After all this is a change, but is it a good change? Like other reviewers I'm not impressed with the ingredient list. For the price it seems like there are far too many fillers in the food. And the food is a bit "moist" and in my experience working in a pet store dog food with moisture can easily start to bread mold and other bacteria. I'm not saying this bag had mold but it's a concern I have. My dogs did like this food, it's a nice treat for them but I think I'll stick with my current brand. Sure I'm paying about 25% more per bag when matching pound for pound but the food I feed them now doesn't contain the fillers, doesn't contain the coloring and doesn't have moisture built into it which creates some worry but also creates more weight so all in all it's less food when you consider it. Plus in my house my dogs don't do well with moist foods. It creates a mess on the back end if you know what I mean.<br /><br />I would pass on this, it's ok for the occasional treat or change if you want to mix it up a little bit (ensure you do so responsibly so you don't get your dogs sick), but I wouldn't make this a daily food for them.

review/summary: My Two Pooches LOVE it!
review/text: I have a 2 year old chihuahua, and a 1 year old something.....my husband says it's Arnold Ziffle because she looks just like him.  Anyway, I put this in their dishes tonight and it was like watching a feeding frenzy of ravenous sharks.  Yeah, I think this stuff went over pretty well.  I even tasted it myself, after reading the ingredients of course.  The first on the list was beef followed by a lot of soy products and then somewhere about 1/5 down the list was CORN.  I thought it tasted pretty good too, except for the harder green pellet like things.  They had a very harsh soy aftertaste.<br /><br />Since both of my dogs are very small (even Arnold), I can afford to buy the more expensive dog foods to feed them.  And I very much prefer dry over canned or moist (though the reddish meaty granules in Chef Michael's were sort of chewy) to keep their teeth clean and white and they both apparently will wolf this stuff down.<br /><br />It's better than a lot of dog food, but worse than others of course.  But if your dog is finicky, it might like this stuff pretty good.

review/summary: I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE COMPLAINING IS ABOUT!
review/text: There are quite a few negative on this product. So, before serving it to my Chow doggies I took this bag to my vet to see what he had to say about. All those complaints on here for nothing, according to my vet. He said this stuff has some really good ingredients in it and he didn't see much of anything that detrimental to a dog's longterm health and longevity. He said it does have some animal byproduct in it, which isn't the best, but isn't harmful. He said this dog food should be given mainly as a treat or reward from time to time and not for every meal. I probably won't be buying much of it because it is a bit pricey. My dogs absolutely love this stuff. They will eat this stuff about like I eat chocolate bars, if I allow them and myself to do so. Of course, there's not much my dogs won't eat. They are complete pigs and beg and beg at the table. We try to limit the amount of table food they get to only a couple of times a week. Sometimes though they give my wife and I the sad puppy dog eyes and we give in. What's funny, to me at least, is that Sirloin is my least favorite steak to eat, but most people love them. My dogs certainly do. If you can afford it's a great way to give your dogs a nice treat.

It's a nice, gourmet step up from his usual kibble, and he loves the heck out of it. Same goes for a much smaller dog, my friend's tiny little westie terrier Lucy; obviously she gets a lot less, but she has a lot of allergies and intolerances, and this food agrees with her in every way. You're probably hard pressed to find a dog who wouldn't go ga-ga for this tasty treat.

review/text: Our dogs seem to have very broad tastes in dog food.  They were just as happy to eat this as their regular food, or any other dog food we've given them.  Given that this is almost certainly a bit pricier than what they normally get, this would have to be a special treat kind of thing for us.  It didn't seem to do anything special for them in terms of energy, coat, etc., but they really weren't on it long enough for a valid comparison.  If I had more money than human being should be allowed to have, this would certainly be a regular part of their diet, just because they seemed to like it so much.

review/text: Our two aging Yorkies just love Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin.  It is generally understood that Yorkies are as picky as any dog can get.  Ours are no exception.  My neighbor's dog has gained a lot of anticipation from our excessive dog food.  We buy this product and ours turn their noses and walk away even when hungry.  NOT with Chef Michael's, however.  It is on the top of their LIKE list and when the bag comes out they are there with wagging tails and loving faces.  What more could an owner ask?  In an effort to eliminate another brand I thought I could fool them by mixing the Chef's with Brand X (a well known national brand) and alas dogs once again proved just how smart and selective they are.  Each of them assumed his and her eating position and began to literally push aside the Brand X food and rapidly consume the Chef's.

review/summary: Dogs love it
review/text: There are two components of a review about dog food for me:  Do the dogs like it?  And is it good for them?<br /><br />To answer the first, my dogs LOVE it.  We had just finished a bag of feed so I opened this and they instantly started smelling the air as I poured it from the bag into their feed container.  From there I scooped out their usual quantity into each bowl and where they usually follow me with interest to where I set the bowls down for them to eat, this time they fairly pranced - leaping up and down with excitement at the "treat" that was in store for them.  On their old food, they would eat until they were full but often wander away with a little food left in the bottom to come back to later.  This time, they finished the bowl and then licked it clean.  So it certainly passed the taste test.<br /><br />Next is the question as to whether or not it is good for them.  I gave it a 4 because the overall ingredients are not terrible.  The first ingredient is meat - the first rule of thumb for me in any pet food.  However the second two ingredients are soy products, followed by brewers rice, more soy and then corn.  Included in the ingredients is also wheat.  So although it starts well, with Beef as the first ingredient, in the end it is bulked out by grains of all sorts, which lower the production costs for the manufacturer and keep the food priced lower for the consumer but also lowers the nutritional benefit to the animal.<br /><br />One last comment.  My first impression when I scooped the food into the bowls was that it is designed to look like a stew. Visually, it contains brown chunks - the meat - small green balls - the peas - and similarly sized yellow balls - the corn.  The problem is that a bowl of stew containing meat, peas and corn sounds yummy to us and is, in fact, designed to appeal to US visually - but is NOT a diet I would feed my dogs.  And, since dogs rely on smell more than vision, the visual appeal would be lost on them.  So I guess I didn't really appreciate what felt like a "trick" to get us to think of this as a good wholesome food for the dogs.

review/summary: My Dog LOVED it BUT
review/text: My dog is a very picky eater and she loves this dog food so I thought I hit the jackpot. However, after looking at the ingredients I have found that I have NOT hit the jackpot. This dog food contians a lot of corn, wheat, and food coloring which I do not like but I can live with. The main ingredient I do NOT like though is the ANIMAL DIGEST and I cannot live with this being in my dogs food. I will NOT be giving my dog this food again. Chef Michael should be ashamed that he put his name on this dog food. I wanted to give this dog food one star BUT my dog did like it so I bumped it up to 2 stars but I will not give it any higher rating than that.

review/summary: "You can put lipstick on a pig...."
review/text: The only thing that really bothers me about this dog food is the lengths they go to in order to dress it up as something more than it is.  It's a basic dog food, marginally better than plain old Purina Dog Chow, and does meet dogs' basic nutritional needs.  My dogs were happy to eat it (but they've never met a dog food they didn't like).<br /><br />However, as someone else noted, it is very cereal-heavy, including grains such as corn and wheat that many people prefer to avoid in their dog's food.  Calling it Grilled Sirloin doesn't mesh with its being primarily cereal.  That's like calling your bowl of Wheaties a milkshake because it has milk in it.<br /><br />The "potato and green bean garnishes" are just that, garnishes, on the order of a small twig of parsley on your plate.  Potatoes and green beans are near the bottom of the list of ingredients, if you don't count the many added vitamins (if the ingredients are so good, why are so many vitamins added to meet nutritional standards?), preservatives, and artificial colors.  What you see in the mix is extruded kibble dyed green and yellow, not actual pieces of vegetables.<br /><br />So, we have a bag of cereal called "sirloin," with dyed green and yellow bits implied to be beans and corn, mixed with kibble extruded in a way that makes it resemble meat.  I wish they'd put more effort into the recipe and less into the disguise.

review/text: OMG, I must have died and gone to doggie heaven!  This dog food is de-e-e-lish!  It even beats the occasional, healthy, homemade tidbits my people put in my bowl.<br /><br />Now, I'm not your typical I-Eat-Anything doggie.  I'm particular and when I've eaten enough, I walk away from my bowl--even when there's still food in it.  But, this Chef Michael's is irresistible.  I didn't know dog food tasted so good.<br /><br />My family followed the directions on the bag, adding this new food to my old brand in small increments.  My tummy feels fine and my poop is normal so, what's not to like?<br /><br />Being an extremely intelligent fellow, I figured out how to eat only the Chef Michael's pieces and leave the old stuff in my bowl.  Of course, Dad tried to outsmart me and mixed it all up.  But, I showed him!  I even removed one piece of `yesterday's' brand and placed it at his feet.  Then I went back to my bowl, finishing my yummy feast.<br /><br />Oh, what's that?  I hear a bag crinkling...could it be DINNERTIME???  Gotta' run.<br /><br />`Chow', baby!

review/text: My dog absolutely went insane for this food.  It has sirloin bits, green bean bits and potato bits--it doesn't look like typical dry food.  I think he is eating better than I am!!  Even the fussy cat eats wants to eat this food.  I normally have to make sure the dog does not sneak food from the cat's dish but this is the first time I have had to worry about the cat sneaking food from the dog.  I don't have to be too careful because the food does not remain in the dog's dish very long since he likes this food so much.  It seems the only drawback would be the price.

review/summary: Dog loved the taste but I disliked the ingredients
review/text: My dog is a 62lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his food so finding the right mix can often be difficult. While he loves just about any treat, I always have reservations about trying new food. Unfortunately, a large majority of popular dog foods today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new food so here are my thoughts on Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Dog loved it and gobbled it up.<br /><br />+ Some moist and tender food chunks along with the kibble.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Filled with tons of poor ingredients for your dog such as Soy, Chicken by-product, wheat, corn, artificial preservatives, flavors or colors. Artificial colors? Seriously? Do you really think the dog cares what color the food is when they eat it? Who are we trying to appeal to here, the dog or the person?<br /><br />- Expensive for a 4.5lb bag.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food.  However don't we all enjoy food that's bad for us? Unfortunately, that's exactly what this dog food is, bad for your dog. Someone said in a previous review if my dog was reviewing this food it would get 5 stars and my dog would agree with that. Lucky for him I know what's good for his health and Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food isn't it. With so many questionable and downright poor ingredients it's hard to really recommend this food for your dog. I definitely wouldn't purchase it again. Our current food is Nature's Domain Turkey Meal and Sweet Potato which is sold at Cost Co. It contains no potentially harmful ingredients, settles very well with my dog and is only $30 for a 25lb bag. If you're looking for a good healthy food, I recommend Nature's Domain brand or if you want to better educate yourself on what's actually in your current dog food I suggest visiting dogfoodadvisor.com. It's a great site that lists nearly all dog foods, breaks every ingredient and its properties down and gives a final overall rating on the food's quality.

review/summary: No Re-Seal?
review/text: I don't know about your dogs, but my two (a Parson's Jack-mix and moyen Poodle) are nose driven when it comes to chow.  Consequently it is VERY important that I be able to keep their food fresh and odor-ful.  Chef Michael's dog food isn't resealable.  And that's a big one-star drop for me.<br /><br />As far as APPEARANCE it's okay.  The meaty-looking bits look like giant rough extruded fake-bacon bits.  And they are interspersed with green and light brown veggie looking bits.  My dogs don't like the latter, at all.<br /><br />The ODOR isn't all that pleasant to me, but it's not a problem because I can't smell the kibble until my nose is right in the bowl.  My little Jack seems drawn to the smell.  Rodger-Pippin isn't so sure.<br /><br />My final STAR-DROP came from the use of "Animal Digest".  On the surface of it, Animal Digest doesn't sound so bad.  It's a broth made from animal parts.  However, the 'parts' can be anything, including road-kill, and since Purina gets many of their ingredients from China I don't think I'd be comfortable with feeding my family's beloved members this food on a longterm basis.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom & fur-mom

review/summary: Neighbor's Dog (Babysitting) Did NOT Like; Neighborhood DOG REVIEWS - MUST READ!
review/text: I am babysitting a neighbor's dog; his elderly wife is unable to handle him (while he is older, but overweight - now getting back in shape); her husband is now in a different Assisted Living Facility Home for Therapy before coming home. I have 2 differing Purina's brand, one which he practically went crazy over (that which my cats thought were their food) - with 2 cups in 2 different bowls ... he did not like this one at all. Added some warm beef broth and made a gravy with this to see if he would eat it, instead, he flipped the bowl over completely and made a mess. He did not like this period - dry or gravy-like. So I went to my neighbor's house who has a Mixed-Breed Peki-Terrier; and the Owners put him down and at first he tilted his head ... oh he practically devoured it! When added with a little warm water for a gravy-like treat; he just went literally nuts!<br /><br />Took this down for some other Dog Reviews:<br /><br />Down to the neighbor's around the corner:<br />Rotweiller: Snubbed it instantly without any hestitation<br />German Shepherd snarfed it up and ate the Rotweiller's too and wanted more!<br /><br />Went to another neighbor's home who has 3 dogs:<br />English Bull Dog: Did not like with or without gravy mix<br />Pit Bull Mix: Unsure at first; after a few bites - then gobbled it up with tail wagging but wanted to play rather than eat.<br />Greyhound: Wasted no time trying to eat before it was poured into the bowl first! *laughing*<br /><br />Another Neighbor's House:<br />Brown (light) Chow-Chow: tipped bowl over and walked off<br />Black Chow Chow: YUMMY! Even ate off the ground that his sister tipped over and begged for more; tail was wagging like a mad maniac!<br /><br />Last Neighbor's House:<br />Great Dane: finished the entire bag off and stuck head in bag looking for the last kibble, was disappointed; tail was wagging like crazy!<br /><br />There's your Dog Reviews - pretty much most of the Dogs Loved It while a few didn't.

review/summary: Roadkill?
review/text: When I first put this in my dogs dish she looked at it like it was a coiled rattlesnake. I pretended to eat a handful and she dove right in. ...."Mama is eating it so it must be people food!"....(dogs are so gullible).<br /><br />I'll admit I was a little turned off by all the "chef Michael....gourmet..grill marks" hype.  I think you could color it green and call it roadkill and the dogs wouldn't know the difference. Yeah, I know , all of the hype is for the purchaser.<br /><br />As for the ingredients, what do I know? The ingredients are listed on the product page if you find that helpful. I sort of think it's like reading the ingredients on "all ground beef patties" then discovering part of the beef is "pink slime". The food is rated 1 star when compared to others which doesn't sound so great to me.<br /><br />I just have to trust that the researchers and developers at Purina know what is good for animals. The little "bean and potato garnish" are a crunchy dry food and the "meat" looking pieces have sort of a rubbery play-dough texture. Maybe a little easier for older dogs to chew.<br /><br />The bottom line: My dog eats it and it seems to agree with her.  She will usually only eat dry food if I mix a spoonful of science diet cat food in it .

review/summary: Better Than Beneful . . . .
review/text: I convinced my sister to stop feeding her dog <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>, after reading the ingredients in it.  She tried this one next.  It had a much better ingredients list, but her dog did not like it.  I believe because her dog is use to eating chicken or lamb.  The Beneful was the only beef dog food he had eaten in a long time, and there was so little beef, he probably didn't even taste it. I told her there was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJO8T6">Chef Michael's Oven Roasted Chicken Dry Dog Food 11.5 Pound Bag</a>, but she instead let her husband choose the next bag of food. He bought something very expensive that had New Zealand lamb as the number one ingredient, and had absolutely no corn. The dog loves it.

review/summary: Ingredient list doesn't cut it
review/text: The quick way to evaluate any dog food is to look at the first ingredients in ingredients list. For Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food, we have these as the first eight components:<br /><br />Beef<br />soybean meal<br />soy flour<br />animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of vitamin E)<br />brewers rice<br />soy protein concentrate<br />corn gluten meal<br />ground yellow corn<br /><br />... This is not a good list. Beef will shrink and lose its water after cooking. Soybean meal and soy flour boost the protein level, but provide less quality to this food than would actual meet. Animal fat could be any sort of gross restaurant or slaughterhouse leavings, according to the DogFoodAdvisor website. Brewers rice, soy protien concentrate, corn gluten meal and ground yellow corn are all immediate red flags of little nutritional value to a dog.<br /><br />As with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JRUT6">Purina Beneful Healthy Radiance, 7-Pounds</a>, this is yes beautifully packaged, but not really that good for your dog. I'll stick with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFIY92">Verus Life Advantage Chicken Meal, Oats And Brown Rice Formula Dry Dog Food</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFSBC2">Verus Advanced Opticoat Diet Menhaden Fish Meal And Potato Formula Dry Dog Food</a>

review/text: I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel... about 5.5 years old and about 13-14 pounds.<br /><br />He's got bad teeth (a few have actually fallen out) and even in his younger years he didn't like eating normal-sized dog food, preferring the smaller stuff for puppies.<br /><br />I got this from the Amazon Vine program, and when I saw how big the pieces were, I figured he wouldn't like eating it (pieces too big). However -- to my surprise -- he loves this food. He scarfs it down immediately as though it were a treat instead of his regular food.<br /><br />This stuff smells a little more meaty and more 'appetizing' than the Science Diet I was feeding him before. You can tell this is high quality as far as dry dog food goes. The proportion of chewy pieces to dry pieces is also high... at least half of the food is composed of the chewy pieces, which my dog loves.<br /><br />I can't speak for other people's pets, but mine loves this stuff. I've never seen him enjoy a dry food this much, and will probably be switching to this from now on. 5 Stars.

review/text: My dogs tend to have sensitive stomachs and many dog foods cause them to get sick. We tried to Costco brand and we had trouble, so I was hesitant to try Chef Michael's. But, I hated to keep buying the dog food from the vet. They are so expensive! When I opened the bag and was surprised that it didn't have that odor that many dog foods have. It actually smelled kind of good. The true test would be how my dogs liked it and if it caused gas and an upset stomach. They ate the food up immediately and were searching for more. Fortunately,Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin didn't upset their stomach one bit! No gas, good solid poop and happy dogs! My only complaint is that the bag doesn't have a gripper seal. I had to find another container to keep it in, which is a bit of a bummer, but I'd much rather find a container than clean up after a sick dog. I'll be sure to get this food again in the future.

review/summary: Good "dry" food for senior dogs or tender mouths
review/text: My dogs are not picky; they generally eat whatever kibble I put in front of them. There are many reviews above that list chapter and verse of what is healthful and what is not regarding dog food. Just like with humans, there are a variety of camps regarding more or less meat, grains, etc... My dogs enjoyed this food and ate it right up. That said, this product is pretty expensive per pound but here is where it could really come in handy: If you have a dog with a tender mouth (say dental problems or such) this food would be a lifesaver for someone who doesn't want to mess with canned food. If your dog is a slow eater or a nibbler this would be a great alternative to nasty canned food sitting around. I don't like canned pet food because it gets nasty after sitting, and it can be hard to clean the dish or the floor around it. This is a neat option versus canned food.

I can't taste it so of course I was relying on my dog's willingness to eat it when put in her bowl. I must admit the thing that I loved the best was that it didn't stink like most dog food/kibble.  Dry dog food really stinks to me no matter what brand I've tried but this didn't have that stinky smell. I give this a thumbs up and will be trying it out. Haven't checked the price to compare to others but as long as it's not double the price I will be purchasing another bag.

review/summary: Low Quality Dog Food
review/text: Unless you are already feeding your dog a low end dog food, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin is not something I'd recommend feeding to your pet.<br /><br />I try to feed our dog better grade dog food.  Right now he is eating Castor and Pollux Natural Ultramix.  There are several other high quality pet foods available.<br /><br />If you'd rather skip this review and are looking for a better quality dog food, there are several out there, some of which strive to serve "natural/organic" products.  Here are justa few, listed alphabetically:  Blue Buffalo, Castor and Pollux, Merrick (who recently merged with Castor and Pollux), and Wellness.<br /><br />Chef Michael's is a Purina product.  While not trying to malign Purina, I am not aware of any better quality dog foods they produce.<br /><br />The ingredients, in order, directly from the label:<br />Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite. C-5900.<br /><br />Nothing against beef for my dog, so it doesn't start out bad.  But after that....soybean meal and soy flour are just "protein fillers".  The next largest ingredient is animal fat.  Animal fat can come from numerous sources, including rodents, diseased animals, and you really just don't know the source.  After that, there are several grains, many of which do not provide any nutritional value for a dog, like corn. This dog food also contains poultry by-products.  Any by-product is typically bad:  it can be various parts of animals, heads, feet, beaks. Some people point to its protein concentration, but in general meat and poultry by-products should be avoided.<br /><br />There is also artificial coloring in the food.  Not that there is necessarily anything horrible with this, but it is dog food, so why add something which has no value and could potentially be harmful to the dog?<br /><br />So what is there to like about this product?  As a dog food, really not much.  But, dogs do seem to like the taste, so, like junk food for humans, maybe a little bit in moderation can be used as a treat.  The food consistency is "chewy" so I squeeze together a couple of pieces and give it to my dog as a "candy" treat.<br /><br />Sadly, the price of this dog food is not so low as to make it such a value by weight as to draw people to buy it.  For this 4.5 pound bag, for the same price per ounce, you can buy a much better dog food. Even when buying a larger bag of this product, it is not that much less per ounce than better quality dog food.  When you factor in that it's got a lot of low quality ingredients, it is not a better bargain at all.

review/summary: My dog liked it
review/text: It's hard for me to write a review for dog food because I'm never really sure what to say other than whether or not my dog liked it. She did like Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. I'm not sure, though, that it is the healthiest dog food out there, though I'm not as "up" on what ingredients are best for dogs, and what should be avoided. It does seem like there are a lot of filler/cheap ingredients instead of the truly nutritious ingredients one would want. The interesting thing about this particular dog food was the shape and texture. The "meat" pieces reminded me of the shape and texture of popcorn. I had never seen such a thing in a dog food before.

review/summary: Seems better for your dog
review/text: I like this dog food because they claim to have No added artificial preservatives and the #1 ingredient is beef, so it appears that the dog food would be better for your dog then a lot of the ones you can get in the stores.  My dog seemed to enjoy it as well.  I am sceptical of all the things they put in dog food, but I have a dog that doesn't tolerate "real" food well, so if you have to give him a dog food, this doesn't seem too bad.

review/summary: The dogs rate it *****
review/text: First the dogs love it, this food must smell great, taste great, and have a texture that the animals really enjoy. If you have a dog that is a picky eater then you might give this a try.<br /><br />As to the issues with a lot of the ingredients being secondary use or byproducts.<br />I am not a processed food expert, I do see that the number one ingredient is beef and I generally assume that animal food is made using safe secondary use food products which seems ok to me. We take the best cuts of beef and put them on the grill, next we grind up the next best to make our burgers, lunchmeat, and sausage, perhaps some of that same product as well as what is left goes to the animals we care for, should we just throw it all away instead? We pull oils and milk from soybeans to cook with and to make tofu. What happens to the fiber? We feed it to animals. Since we as humans eat whole soybeans I have to imagine that eating the fiber and remaining protein is not a terrible thing.<br /><br />Certainly all animals and humans have some allergies and digestive issues. Some people can't drink milk and some animals apparently don't do well with soy we don't seem to have an issue in our house. If your dog has issues and needs rice or something else then you should pick another food for them. If you have a healthy food that the dogs don't love, sprinkle a bit of this on top and perhaps you will have luck getting them to eat the less flavorful and perhaps healthier food with this addition. However this may be all you need to feed as according to Purina "Animal feeding tests using Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) procedures substantiate that Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor and potato & green bean garnishes provides complete and balanced nutrition for maintenance of adult dogs."

review/summary: chocolate + coconut = Heaven
review/text: I am a huge fan of coconut and chocolate is my weakness.  The manufacturer mixes both to create a pretty good product with Cacao Bliss.<br /><br />When I first received this jar, I was not too impressed.  The appearance of the product was that of stale/old chocolate. It was crumbly when I tried to dip my spoon in it.  I had anticipated a creamy substance.  This product is not creamy out of the jar.  Unless the entire jar has been left in the sun or in a hot spot, don't expect to dip your knife or spoon in and spread it around on a piece of toast.<br /><br />In terms of eating options, I do recommend heating the product.  While I now enjoy eating it in its solid form out of the jar, heating some of the product creates a substance that can be spread easily on toast.  I also like taking shavings of this product and sprinkling it on cupcakes.  The coconut and chocolate flavor is a subtle addition to any sweet treat.<br /><br />I will note that the flavor took some getting used to.  It probably took three to four samplings before I started to really want to eat spoonfuls of the product.  I think with any new product that has a slightly different consistency and flavor there is an adjustment period.  I'm glad I didn't give up on it and took some time to experiment with how it could be used.  I will be incorporating this product into gift baskets for both my vegan and non-vegan friends and family.<br /><br />It is recommended that this product not be refrigerated.<br /><br />A snapshot of the product's nutrition facts can be found in the product image gallery.<br /><br />As a vegan product, there is no milk, eggs, honey or other animal-based substances that go into the formulation of this product.  According to the product packaging, this product is "made in a facility that processes tree nuts and soy, but does not process peanuts, gluten, dairy, cholesterol or GMO's."  This product is also sugar cane free.<br /><br />Considering that Amazon typically packages products in sets of 2 or 6, it is nice to be able to purchase one jar without committing 40 or 50 dollars on a bulk set of 6.  I do wish the jars were a bit larger.<br /><br />I give this product 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Cacao Bliss is made in the United States.

review/summary: Cacao BLISS indeed!
review/text: Holy moly this stuff is delicious!  I am a total sucker for anything with chocolate and coconut, so I admit bias, but this is just....so.... GOOD.  Good for you, too.  It is crumbly when not heated, and it is definitely not oversweet, so you get the full experience of the deliciously dank cacao and the natural sweetness of the coconut.  Seriously, I eat this stuff right out of the jar with a spoon, it's that kind of good.  I also put a tablespoon or so into banana smoothies (yum!) or put a dollop on fresh fruit -- strawberries go great with this stuff.<br /><br />Caveat: if you are one of those folks who is a sugar addict or who can't do flavor without some major sweetness added then this product may not be for you, because it is "natural" sweet, not "industrial" sweet.  For those of you who find fruit to be plenty sweet then by all means this stuff is a complete five star.

However with the addition of cacao to the butter I think they definitely took it up a notch.  I love to use this on a slice of toast in the morning and it provides such a wealth of nutrients as well as being very filling.<br /><br />I am sure there are more applications for it, but right now I can't move past it slightly melting on a slice of warm toast !

review/summary: Sweet Treat
review/text: This is my first time trying the Artisana brand (comes highly recommended); I normally use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAT6NG">Nutiva Certified Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil -- 54 fl oz</a> or the Trader Joe's brand (which is virgin, not extra virgin coconut oil). I am a regular user of coconut oil but had never tried it mixed with sugar cane free, vegan cacao. It's definitely healthy. Taste-wise, it's a LOT less sweet than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BTBR1Q">Nutella Hazelnut Chocolate Spread 13 Oz.</a> - which I sadly love! - so this will take some getting used to. But, in trying to cut back on processed foods and refined sugar, this is a good trade off. Just like regular coconut oil, this treat stays in solid form in cooler temperatures (under 70F/21C) and will melt at higher temps, even turning liquid when it's warm (above 80F/26C). In its solid form, it breaks up like chocolate shavings; in its softer form, it has the consistency of Nutella or smooth peanut butter. It can be enjoyed on bread or salt-free crackers - or eaten alone, straight out of the jar - for a mildly sweet treat. However, be prepared that this product is not that sweet; it has more of an earthy, cacao flavor and the coconut flavor is not as strong as in plain coconut oil. Otherwise, it's a healthy way to add the benefits of organic coconut oil and the sweetness that comes from nature (cacao) to one's diet.<br /><br />**Note: Be be mindful that some may experience a mild-to-moderate allergic reaction (i.e., itching, hives, headache, throat swelling etc.) to this product, most likely in response to the cacao. Unfortunately, I was one of those people - I found out the hard way - but Amazon's excellent customer service was very helpful in issuing me a refund. Too bad, as I otherwise liked this product.

review/summary: pretty good, but just don't eat too much
review/text: i have to say when i first ate this product, i was excited - it tasted delicious and reminded me of a chocolate macaroon. i recommend it heated - i ate it at room temp. and it was a solid, crumbly mess. still good, but not as appetizing. this product should come with a WARNING: if you take it by the spoonfuls because of its wholesomeness and great taste, you WILL get a nasty stomach ache later on and then diarrhea or some variation of that. IT'S a LAXATIVE, no doubt. Right now, I can't even think about eating it for another few days, as my stomach is trying to recover. lol. My other issue is that this has AGAVE SYRUP, which I try to avoid when possible. As Dr. Mercola has made clear, agave SYRUP isn't so natural and wonderful as it is a PROCESSED product with unnatural, unhealthy (high) levels of fructose, not unlike high fructose corn syrup. But don't expect to hear that from the natural health community anytime soon - once a healthy food darling takes off, it's hard for it to come back down, as ppl get so fanatical about it. So, anyway, all in all, I would recommend this Cacao Bliss can do as an OCCASIONAL indulgence.

review/summary: delicious and not too sweet
review/text: If you like extremely sweet things, like fudge, you might be disappointed by this.  But if you're looking for a comparatively healthy way to enjoy intense dark-chocolate flavor, give it a try.  The flavor is amazingly rich and chocolatey, and I love that it is not too sweet.  I also like that it is sweetened with Stevia instead of with sugar or high fructose corn syrup or something like that.  It might take a little getting used to (especially if you were expecting something like fudge or cake frosting), but I think the level of sweetness is just right.<br /><br />As for the texture, the product at room temperature is solid and crumbly, not really the right consistency for spreading on toast, cupcakes, etc.  Just put it in the microwave briefly and it will become easily spreadable (or spoonable).  In my opinion it tastes delicious either way!

review/text: After reading all of the positive reviews, I was anxious to try out this product.  I was so disappointed when I got it.  The texture is chalky and the taste to me is unpleasant.  It was really quite solid so I warmed it up so that I could mix it up better.  It became more of a spreadable consistency, but the grainy texture and the taste did not improve.  I'm going to try using some of it in my smoothies, but if it still doesn't taste good to me, it's going into the garbage.<br /><br />I also ordered the Artisana coconut butter and Artisana macadamia butter.  I had the same same bad experience with the coconut butter in that the texture was grainy and the taste was unpleasant to me.  I did, however, really like the macadamia butter a lot.

I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single-serving tea bags is a good choice.

review/summary: Stash Chocolate Mint tea
review/text: Fast shipping. Smells good when you open the tea bag - tastes like watered down coffee with a faint mint aftertaste. Not recommended.

review/summary: I love them
review/text: Dried pears are my absolute favorite dried fruit but they aren't easy to find. Trader Joe's used to sell them for $4 a pound but discontinued them several years ago, to my dismay.<br /><br />While these cost more, they are very good and still a decent deal if you have Amazon Prime. I didn't think they tasted any different from the ones I've had in the past.

review/summary: Favorite dried fruit
review/text: I've been looking for good dried pears since I ate some in a dried fruit mix and loved them.  These are just as good as those first ones I ate.  Tender, moist, and sweet, these are about as close to candy as dried fruit gets while being relatively low in sugar and high in fiber.

review/summary: Nice dried pear
review/text: These dried pear were packaged well and tastes better than Mariani dried pear in the combo package.  The resealable tab is well designed.  I don't taste the sulfur dioxide that much.

review/summary: too dry and chewy
review/text: They come in packages that are folded, not sealed shut, and the quality was uneven.  Perhaps 20% of the pears are truly soft and moist, the rest are varying shades of dried out.  Will not be buying these again.<br /><br />I received some dried pears as a present years ago and those pears were uniformly big, moist and juicy!  I wish I remembered the brand, cause good dried pears are wonderful!

review/summary: A delicious surprise
review/text: I like the taste of dried fruit, but usually I feel as if I'm giving my jaws a workout whenever I eat some. These pears are soft, almost creamy in consistency, and sweet beyond belief. I had intended to chop the pears and use them in baked goods, but I guess I have to wait for the next batch to do that!

review/summary: Misleading
review/text: I must admit, these taste very good and info on the box says "Indulgence you can feel good about". Don't believe that for one minute.<br /><br />The second ingredient in this product is sugar. It's a tiny, thin 2.5 inch square (approx 17g or slightly over half an ounce). Look how this product compares to a fun size snickers bar (15g)<br /><br />  Granola Thin  /  Fun Size Snickers<br />Calories:  80 /  72<br />Cal from fat: 35  /  33<br />Total Fat  4g  /  3.7g<br />Saturated fat  1.5g  /  1.3g<br />Cholesterol  0  /  2mg<br />Sodium  75mg  /  39.9mg<br />Total Carb  11gm  /  8.9gm<br />Sugars  6gm  /  7.4gm<br />Protein  1gm  1.2gm<br /><br />These actually compare somewhat UN-favorably with the candy bar, at least in terms of fat, sodium and carbs. Granted, the difference is not huge. What bugs me is it's essentially candy masquerading as "healthy". Also, with both the fiber is fairly negligible. I'm not saying they come right out and say it's "healthy" but they certainly do imply it.<br /><br />Lets talk about cost. There are 10 packages in a box. Each package is .6oz. I paid about 3.40 for my box. I paid that for about 6-7 ounces of product. So if I were buying them by the pound, I guess that would be over 8.00 for 1 pound. For that price, I can buy myself a nice steak.<br /><br />As I said before, these do taste good but I find the cost is prohibitive and they aren't really any better for you than candy and are very small. I doubt I'll be buying them again and for sure they are not an "indulgence" I would feel good about giving to kids.

review/summary: Product is wonderful but this package is way overpriced!!!
review/text: These granola thins are a great product.  Absolutely delicious and still healthy.  It's so hard to find something that tastes really good with low calories and carbs.  This particular package of three 10-pk boxes is outrageously overpriced as I picked up a 10-pk box at Kroger the other day for $3.39.  I'm thinking $19.99 for 3 boxes is a huge profit for somebody.  I love buying snacks on Amazon but I'll stick to the grocery for these until a better deal comes along.

review/summary: NUTS????  WAY OVERPRICED!!!
review/text: This product tastes good, but like the other person posted.....this is WAY OVERPRICED!  >$8/box???!!!!  I love the taste; the sugar content is not too terrible; and the calories aren't too bad, for me anyway, but the thins ARE very crumbly; I eat them over a plate.  This is NOT a snack-in-the-car treat, unless of course you don't mind getting crumbs and possibly chocolate all over yourself and your vehicle.

review/summary: Get Nature Valley Oats N' Dark Chocolate Instead
review/text: That tastes much better and more filling, and I think they're healthier.  I have been buying these Oats N' Dark Chocolate for a while until I saw a big package of these granola thins at Costco... it was interesting at first, but I realize it tastes more like milk chocolate than dark. Plus, pay attention to the interesting comparison to the Snickers Fun Size by another commenter.

review/summary: Will not purchase again
review/text: Good concept, poor execution.  Individually packaged pressed granola with chocolate holding it together.  They are crumbly, messy, and not very tasty.  Don't even think about giving them to your children for a snack... What a mess!  Not to mention, over-priced.  I bought them because I enjoy other Nature Valley products, and had a coupon for a new product.  Will not purchase again, would not recommend.

review/summary: not worth the mess
review/text: These are delicious and i don't buy healthy foods so i don't care about the candy bar comparison. I bought the chocolate ones and always want to eat two. but as other reviewers have stated, they are ridiculously messy. crumbs every where. you have to look in the mirror when your done eating to make sure you don't have chocolate on your face. you must also wash your hands. this is not a granola bar for on-the-go, which is why i buy granola bars in the first place. i have never eaten a granola bar sitting down at a table with a plate and napkin. they are yummy but i think i'd rather have a chewy bar.

review/summary: Too Messy
review/text: While these taste good, they are far too messy.  I am consistently challenged by them in attempting to avoid both (1) getting crumbling granola all over my desk and floor and (2) having the chocolate melt all over my fingers.  I have had granola bars my whole life and I am well aware of the crumbs they can generate--but these bars will send granola flying just by opening the wrapper and the chocolate on these bars melts instantly upon any bodily contact (like fingers).  I bought these as a snack of convenience, which they most definitely are not.
