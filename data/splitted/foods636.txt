review/summary: Why so sneaky?
review/text: I care less about carbs than I do calories for weight control, and when I went to the Dreamfields website it gives a very confusing and evasive explanation of the number of calories per pack. So I emailed for an explanation and the explanation was equally evasive. It says to essentially to forget the FDA required nutritional label of 190 calories because you will only be digesting 129 calories. So I asked and they later confirmed that yes you are actually putting 190 calories in your mouth, but I guess you have to accept their opinion that you only will absorb 129. I keep a journal of all calories, so do I document 190 or 129? If it was only 129 why would they be required to put 190? To me it sounds like a game, the same game they appear to be playing with the carb count. Unless it is otherwise univerally accepted by the scientific community I say it has 190 calories.

review/summary: dreamfields pasta
review/text: I was surprised that a "modified" pasta could taste so good. I'm not diabetic, but want to eat healthier where I can, so this pasta peaked my interest. I cooked it very simply - just added a good olive oil, salt, pepper, and dried marjoram after it was boiled (slightly undercooked) - very good. I could see where you might not stay full for long with the reduced carbs, but if you want to be able to eat pasta this is a good one to try.

review/summary: Ciao To Unsatisfying Pasta
review/text: I tried this pasta because it was on sale at my local store, I usually buy the discount-priced store brands. And I was willing to excuse the slightly higher price (even with a coupon) on the premise I was eating 'heathy'.<br /><br />Well, I found out that after eating a dish of this stuff, I felt hungry again by dinner. I have fairly good diet control, so I assumed it was the low-carb construction. Having not eaten a low-carb pasta before, I was theorizing on it's effects.<br /><br />I then did some independent web research on this suspicion. And other people also had the same experience after having eaten this product. It does not leave you full. This defeats the purpose of eating.<br /><br />Buying this product at any price was a waste if I was not nourished. I might as well only had been imagining about eating. And considering that I buy pasta to be economically frugal in today's oh-so trying times, this is one brand which won't be cooked up again.

I can't tell if any treats are missing, but this is definitely not a "new" box of treats.

review/summary: Our dogs give Crunch 'n Clean Savory Flavors Mixed Reviews
review/text: Our vet recommends--nags--that we brush our dogs' teeth. Our dogs, on the other hand, think that's an awful idea and are not the least cooperative. Therefore, we try to give them treats that might have some benefit to their unbrushed teeth. Our puppy gobbles these down, no matter the flavor, but our senior dog (who is medium-fussy) will only eat the chicken. In general, she will not eat bacon or beef dog food, and apparently that applies to treats as well. So...in our house, 1 paw up, 1 paw down.

review/summary: I've eaten these for 15 years
review/text: I have been eating these pepperonis for 15 years.  I have had two go bad in storage but that is not Bridgford's fault.  They store for a year or more at room temperature if you keep them in a cool room but if one gets a puncture in the wrapper or exposed to too much heat, etc., then all bets are off.  If the wrapper is still vacuum tight and the expiration date has not passed, then it should be fine.  If the wrapper is loose at all or the product has expired then, yes, you might have one that is bad.  If it is as bad as some here describe then it is my guess they are eating spoiled food.  Not smart.  But in 15 years of eating these, I have only thrown out two for spoilage and that is after having stored them for quite a while.<br /><br />These do have more fat (and more flavor) than bagged pepperoni.  They do make great pizza but you will have a hard time slicing them as thin and even as some big factory - so just don't expect the exact look, feel, and taste.  These are still delicious in their own right.<br /><br />I have to laugh about reviews from folks who eat seemingly spoiled food and then say that anyone who likes this must work for Bridgford. No, I do not work for Bridgford.  I just eat their products.

review/summary: Great if you like solid/dry meat snacks.
review/text: I eat this like a summer sausage with cheese crackers. I'm a fan of meat snacks like beef jerky and summer sausage.<br /><br />I know that this is meant to be used as a pizza topping but all the summer sausages I have tried lately are very moist almost like Spam or potted meat. I like a more dry summer sausauge so I thought I'd try this.<br /><br />This is very dry and solid. This is a plus for me.<br /><br />If you eat it in thick pieces like I do, it has a grainy quality to it. The spices are very strong, distinct, and unique.<br /><br />Where this loses points is the pepperoni casing that surrounds the pepperoni. In most sausages, the casing is so thin that you can't even taste it or know it's there.<br /><br />The casing on this is thick and it tastes similiar to wax paper.<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy this again even to use on pizzas. It will take me a long time to use the two sticks I have left.<br /><br />It's a decent product but just not good to use as a meat snack. It's not worth buying it for pepperoni on a pizza, either, for me. I'll just stick to Hormel for that.

review/summary: Haven't order online yet, but this is abolutely the BEST!
review/text: The person with the negative view must have received pepperoni that had accidentally been punctured at some point. Something is definitely wrong. I have been eating this pepperoni for over 30 years and it is fantastic! Thirty years ago, my brother convinced me to put some slices of the pepperoni in my spaghetti sauce; it was outrageously good. I have used it ever since--me and my entire family.<br /><br />I even eat it "raw" (can't be raw or it wouldn't keep). It's one of my primary snacks on the Atkins (and I've lost 25 lbs). I hope the nay-sayers try it one more time--they are missing out.<br /><br />The super Wal-Marts sell it and they are always running out. And by the way, I live in Sacramento and I'm an instructor at a college; don't work for Bridgeford! I'm only online because Wal-Mart runs out so fast (just came from there) and I would like to buy a large supply I can count on. Actually, I have two, inch and ahalf pieces that I've hid from my husband in the fridge. I guess I'm addicted!

review/text: Haven't bought this online, just at the supermarket.<br />It's good on homemade pizza. Thick slices are amazing. Just peel off the casing or it warps the pepperoni into a concave dome that pools the fat. And there's TONS of fat.<br /><br />Another tip would be to put the cuts on paper towels then nuke them. Good to get rid of as much grease as you can.<br /><br />LOL at the people eating them "raw" and giving it a negative review. What the hell are you expecting?<br />This isn't a sausage stick to eat like you just bought from a gas station.<br />The fat content is way too high be to eaten plain. Add chunks to a soup, bread, whatever.

review/summary: Different
review/text: I have been preparing pizza at home exclusively for over 20 years and only considered recently to purchase pepperoni in quantity to get a better price. I had tried several brands over the years but this brand has not been offered in my area. After reading other reviews I decided buying 3 pounds was not a big risk.<br />I knew not having a meat slicer was going to be a challenge but I also knew that "practice makes perfect".<br />The flavor is different from what I considered to be the best of pepperoni I had tried, but I have not tried any that may have been considered gourmet quality, and I like it. It is oilier but I don't consider it excessively oily.<br />The bottom line is that if you enjoy preparing pizza from home you should try this Bridgford pepperoni. I have had 2 shipments and both arrived in 3 business days.

review/text: This pepperoni is chewy and a bit oily-- good if you're into that. It's also got a surprise in the form of a strong paprika aftertaste that kicks in about 10 seconds after you've eaten a piece (or two, or however many you're going to munch on at that instance). If you're sensitive to spicy food, this probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Each package yields enough pepperoni slices to populate roughly two 12" pizzas (one if you really want to pile on the toppings).

review/summary: Handy for "Seasoning"
review/text: Off and on over the years I've kept a package of pepperoni in the frig because it's a great "seasoning" product.  You can throw a few into just about any savory dish to add extra flavor.  It works a lot like bacon in that regard, in those instances where you don't need a lot of meat, but a little helps to round out the dish.  You can use these instead of adding flavoring fats too, like butter or olive oil.  It adds variety and broadens your options especially for quick cooking, or when you are out of some of your usual basics and don't feel like running to the store.<br /><br />The problem sometimes is that some brands of pepperoni taste a bit odd - perhaps chemically, or greasy, or papery and bland.  These are good.  I will say that these aren't super-intensely flavored, but to my mind that is good for my purposes.  If you want to get an intensely flavored pepperoni for a particular application or for direct snacking, I figure you want to hit up your local Italian market.<br /><br />I also like the size and thinness of these - they are very thin, which I think is great, because I typically would use these in circumstances where I would want only a few and well distributed in small pieces.  I can use these whole where with some other brands that are cut thicker I'd typically have to cut them up some first.<br /><br />These also taste fresh and have a nice texture.

I found it locally and I have been eating it ever since, I use it when making Pizza and it tastes very good, I like it when it gets crispy in the oven on top of the pizza. I am not an expert in pepperoni, however this low calorie choice does a great job, it doesn't have any after taste or all that grease, maybe because it is made with turkey (less grease, fewer calories) and high quality ingredients. I love low calorie turkey pepperoni! Thank You

review/summary: The slices are, um, greasy
review/text: This review is for the regular sliced pepperoni. The way I use them is to nuke them in the microwave for a couple minutes and it makes a nice spicy pepperoni chip for a low carb diet. Kind of reminds me of thin slices of spicy bacon. Anyway I have done this with lots of different kinds of pepperoni. This pepperoni astonishes me at the quantity of fat that is thrown off during cooking. The grease soaks through several layers of paper towel. People talked about eating them raw and if you did, that would be a lot of fat! No other pepperoni I have tried has generated this quantity of fat during cooking.<br /><br />Now once they have crisped up and you have gotten rid of most of the fat, they are crispy and quite nice. The slices are very thin, so if you go too long they will burn in a flash. I am going to try the thick sliced to see how they work.<br /><br />**UPDATE** tried the thick sliced and they are perfect for my application of pepperoni chips! Way better than the thin sliced. Still amazed by how much orange grease comes off these things during microwaving, but when they are done cooking they are a great consistency and have a nice amount of kick to them. Kind of like spicy bacon. I imagine the thick would be very good on pizza if you don't mind some oil added to your pie.

Very strong beefy like taste.<br />Like that other one star review, it smells awful but not that bad when eating.<br />It is edible but definitely not enjoying ones.<br /><br />I'm gonna try to put these on pizza and have it cooked all the way.<br />Or else We're gonna throw away 6 packs of these.

review/text: The first thing I noticed after opening the sealed bag was a godawful smell. It really slaps you in the face.  The taste, well, it's not as bad as the smell, things things are edible, but I can't really say I would enjoy eating them.  The good news is that after eating about a few of them, it totally killed my appetite.

I would urge anyone considering buying the variety packs from crazy cups to do so! I am very happy with it and I can't wait to try the flavors with my new keurig! Although I would like a tea pack that is more iced teas, I am excited to try all the different teas included in the pack, especially their sleepytime and green tea with pomegranate!

review/summary: A Bargain!
review/text: Fructose is fructose. It's a simple sugar found in plants, both fruits and vegetables. Buying fructose is like buying salt. Brand names don't matter much. I'm sure there are conspiracy theories about fructose, but as an old woman I'm tired of hearing "The sky is falling! The sky is falling!"  First it's "Don't eat butter." Then it's "Butter is good for you." Etc. Etc.<br /><br />Getting away from health issues, I have to say that if you want to buy fructose, this Amazon item is a bargain.  You get a LOT of fructose for the money. I think it's less expensive, pound for pound, that the fructose I get from Publix.

review/text: This review is intended to help buyers make an intelligent decision as to the reason for buying this product. I emailed Now Foods requesting information concerning the mercury content of their granulated fructose because I consume so much of it. Their response was "mercury is less than 400 parts per billion". For myself this is unacceptable because I eat fructose and mercury is poisonous. I wish they would bring it down to a reasonable level or better yet find a new way of distilling fructose that is as economical as the Castner-Kellner process.

review/text: I was a bit surprised by the previous review, the reviewer obviously didn't do their research. We highly recommend this product - we settled on this one after we lost two beloved dogs to the Chinese poison in dog food incident a few years ago.  We did our research and found this to be the best available.<br /><br />This is a very healthy base to which you add protein.  Our two Aussies are thriving on this - it has been their main meal for over a year, and they are strong, active, and healthy due in part to the food we give them (we eat organic and healthy, and our dogs do too).  It does smell like alfalfa, but even the most cursory examination reveals a great variety of good, organic foods.

review/summary: Great Nutritious Product, But Need Other Ingredients
review/text: I usually use Only Natural Pet Easy Raw dehydrated food, however I wanted to try Honest Kitchen's brand just to see how it compared, it looked & smelled like a pile of mush grass.  My dogs avoided it like the plague even my little girl who eats anything that is not nailed down.  I was panicking thinking I just wasted a huge chunk of money on something my fur kids won't eat when the Mail<br />Man rang and my delayed shipment of Only Natural brand freeze-dried chicken & beef patties came.  I was soooo happy!!!! I ripped open a bag of chicken, took a sniff, OMG it smelled so good!!!  I quickly crumbled the patty into the pile of green mush and my dogs scarfed it down in 5 minutes.  This food is so great & convenient.  Since it is expensive, I'm going to use it as a flavor enhancer in combination with other raw foods.  The Honest Kitchen food is very nutritious and easy to rehydrate.  However, it needs to be enhanced or combined with other ingredients such as meats (beef,turkey,chicken,buffalo, etc). I also add fish oil for shiney coats and sometimes add a raw egg as well.

It was like receiving a bag of mulched grass. There was very little fruits or vegetables as claimed on the label. It smells like a bag of fresh cut hay. From the look and smell, it's almost all alfalfa. There are other premixed bases available that are much better. I am mixing it with other mixes to make it more appealing to my dog.

My wife's eyes got really big on the first try and she exclaimed "wow, you can really taste the blueberries" (I didn't have to tell her it was supposed to be blueberry).  After the first one, I am in deep fear of eating the whole bag in seconds, but due to the molasses and "natural flavor", they seem so overpoweringly sweet, so after 4 of them (about 35 calories total), I can't take another.  This is good because it's a sweet that prevents me from wanting more.<br />This is for those who like things intense. you like things intense.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />===========<br />Molasses, wheat flour, blueberry puree, citric acid, natural flavor, licorice extract<br /><br />No fat, 8.7 calories per piece, 10 grams per piece.<br /><br />Serving size of 15 pieces (4 times more than I want to eat in 1 sitting):<br />130 calories: 21 g sugars out of 30 g carbs with 1 g protein.<br /><br />Video Comments<br />=============<br />The video is a taste test with my 3 year old son.

My goal has been to find something that does not have Twizzler's Red-40. His little sister did not like them at all.

I ordered the six pack in the baggie, and I am already halfway done with them, if that gives you a sense of just how much of a licorice fan I am. Yum.

review/summary: Good, but too pricey at Amazon
review/text: My kids love this. It's cheap and tastes like chicken noodle soup. I could care less about the nutritional facts. Anyone can look that up online for themselves. Thing is, kids love it and it IS cheap. Great for budgets.<br /><br />That said, watch that price! This very brand can be had at most local Walmart stores. I just bought a case, this very day, at Walmart for $1.82. One case contains 12 individual 3 oz. packages, so that's $0.15 per package.<br /><br />Here Amazon says "24 count, 3 oz." and I have no idea what that means. I can only assume that they mean 24 individual 3 oz. packages. Today Amazon says it is $22.95 which means that each 3 oz. package is $0.96 per package. That is nearly 6 1/2 times the price at Walmart!!!!

review/summary: Chicken Noodle Soup with LOTS of Noodles
review/text: There was a time when we would buy chicken ramen because it was inexpensive.  The flavor is very good and the soup has a lot of noodles compared to canned chicken noodle soup.  This soup is reasonably easy to prepare, and begs to have a few extra vegetables thrown in.  The soup is so simple that even an elementary school child should be able to prepare it.<br /><br />While the soup is relatively low calorie (190 calories), as with many soups it does have a fair amount of salt, with 850 mg of sodium.  If you eat few other foods with much salt, this soup could be a perfect balance.<br /><br />Maruchan Chicken Ramen has been and continues to be a family favorite.  The large quantity of noodles and tasty broth make it perfect for a lunch or dinner meal, especially when you are looking for something a little different.

review/text: Eight dollars a can for an item that normally sells for around four dollars a can is a total rip off. This product was available from Amazon a few months back, but hasn't been in inventory in recent months. Regardless, you can purchase at your local grocery for a little over $4 and on-line in quantity for under that. The price this vendor is attempting to charge is indicative of their lack of business ethics - and Amazon's as well, for letting this vendor do business through their site. The product is wonderful, the vendor is evidently a crook.

It is a deal once it<br />gets below three dollars a tin.

review/text: Since my husband and I met 16 years ago, there has been an ongoing struggle with the lucky charms... I hate the cereal and love the marshmallows and try and Ii might, when there was a box the house, I would invariably eat most of those sweet, crunchy, yummy marshmallows.  Now that there are kids in the picture, the problem has become more serious- they don't take my raids so well!  So I gave my mother-in-law a project (she loves projects).  She freeze dried a bag of mini marshmallows in her machine.  We thought it would be fast but it took 36 hours.  And they didn't taste quite right.  After all that my lovely husband said "did you look on Amazon?". Well, no I hadn't!  I found these (liked the individual bags to keep them fresh) and placed my order. A few days later I surprised everyone with this special dessert. Rave reviews all around. In fact, they are going in my favorite things holiday gifts!  Love them!

review/summary: Very Happy Repeat Consumer
review/text: I was so happy to find this tea available on the web. I was afraid that Dynasty had discontinued it.<br /><br />When I lived in California, I just picked this tea up weekly, at the grocery store. A while back I moved to a very rural area of the Missouri Ozarks. Nobody carried this particular Dynasty tea, which has always been a favorite of mine.<br /><br />I refused to use the last 2 bags I had... until my Amazon shipment arrived. Just in case I had a tea emergency. I cannot list any specific health benefits of this tea, I just know how it makes me feel. It makes me feel better, when I am coming down with something... and it cheers me up, when I am sad. The mild blend, and the soothing aroma, can be the best part of a very rough day. It is so good, I drink it ICED in the summer.<br /><br />I did not buy from this seller, however. The $4.00 per box price is double what the retail selling price of the tea is... and the $6.00 shipping (FOR ONE BOX!!!) is more than what I paid to have a whole case shipped to me.<br /><br />I purchased a full case of 12 boxes of 16 ct. teabags, for around $24. And I couldn't be happier. Please continue to sell this tea. It is GREAT!!! Sellers, please be reasonable with the prices and shipping.

review/text: This tea is ok, it's not bitter but it is so disappointing. I have been searching for a jasmine oolong that I had in a Japanese restaurnat that was so good. This tea is not it. You can't even really smell the jasmine in this tea. The tea I had at the restaurant was a golden color with a slightly sweet taste and aroma of Jasmine. I have bought so many teas trying to find it. The saleslady at the fancy tea shop assured me that this was the tea I have been looking for. NOT! Years ago, I had a manager that came from Japan and she took me to a restaurant which her family and friends frequented and I have not had tea like that since. HELP, I want to enjoy tea like that in my own home.

I use it like "brand name la-di-da" French Vanilla Instant Coffee Beverage that comes in those cute little rectangular tins for a higher price. Just as good and somewhat cheaper, depending on selling price (Amazon cheapest = 6.19 a bag). This size is equivalent to FOUR tins purchased at local stores. Those la-di-das on clearance cost about $2.50 EACH.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: Use 1.5 - 2.0 Tablespoons French Vanilla Instant Coffee Beverage Mix per 8ozs of Hot Water and Stir.<br />Psst, no matter how much or fast you stir, it will not be frothy :)

review/summary: Excellent Product, Poor price and packaging options here
review/text: My daughter (toddler) Is allergic to dairy and soy. We tried goat's milk to no avail and have finally happily settled on Rice Dream Enriched Original. She loves it and Even I like the taste. It's a little sweet and she picked it right up after a year of breastfeeding. With the addition of a multivitamin each day, my pediatrician has approved it's use.<br /><br />We purchase the 64 ounce size for $3.24 at a local store (about $0.05 an ounce.) I came online to look for a better price when purchasing in bulk. The price for these small 8 ounce containers is $0.16 per ounce and causes MUCH more packaging waste. I appreciate the convenience of having it in a small package for dining out, etc... but It's just as easy to take an insulated sippy cup and be more environmentally conscious.<br /><br />The Rice Dream Website sells the 32 ounce size but their price is $0.10 an ounce, without shipping costs. Not much advantage to purchasing online so far. I was hoping that Amazon would have a decent cost on the larger sizes with free super saving shipping, because I could stop shopping at Wal-Mart entirely.<br /><br />I have contacted Amazon to request that they carry the larger 64 ounce size in cases. The first time I called, the Customer Service Rep<br />s computer locked up and she requested that I call her back. The second time I called I was told to leave feedback on the product and that all feedback is read by Amazon and that it could make a difference and might increase the chance that the product would be carried in a larger size, due to demand.

review/summary: Not gluten free.  Way to go Amazon, for making them list it.
review/text: Earlier this year, the FDA enacted a new rule forcing companies to take the gluten-free label from anything that has more than 20 ppm gluten.  (I'm looking at you, Arrowhead Mills and Bob's Red Mill.)<br /><br />However, you can be right at 20 ppm, which makes a lot of celiacs sick, and still label yourself, "gluten free".  (The rule should have said, "less than 20 ppm", not "20 ppm or less".)<br /><br />This is where Amazon is fantastic--they made the company list the gluten in this, so we know it's NOT gluten free.  (I have yet to find a Hain's food product that was actually gluten free, although some of them are legally gluten free.  Look for their name on the labels so you know what to avoid, even if they are hiding behind the federal law and they have labeled their products gf.)<br /><br />Pacific Rice Milk and Whole Foods' store brands of rice milk are gluten free, though.  Buy those instead.

review/summary: Was a great product, now there are better alternatives.
review/text: I used Imagine Rice beverages for many years. I favored them for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula. In additon, studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />Rice Dream has two Healthwise Rice beverage products, that use safflower oil and no canola oil, have half as much sugar, and include plant sterols that may lower serum cholesterol levels. Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink. Westsoy Rice Beverage has a similar consistency to Rice Dream with a little more body and milky flavor, and is canola free.<br /><br />The same canola issue (as well as sugar) also applies to the Imagine frozen desert products.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications below.<br /><br />Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. Check out this small sample of government and peer-reviewed medical journal articles documenting my statements, available online.<br /><br />United States Legislation on Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed Oil, Federal Department of Agriculture, 1985, article 184.1555, sections 3 and 4.<br />Growth Rate, Lipid Composition, Metabolism and Myocardial Lesions of Rats Fed Rapeseed Oils J.

As a result the UK recently warned against feeding rice milk to children. This problem applies to brown and organic rice as well as white rice. I have switched to Pacific All Natural Hemp Non-Dairy Beverage.

review/summary: Chalky Sugar
review/text: The switch to organic is a good step, but Rice Dream rice milk is chalky and too sugary - 23 grams of carbohydrates per serving!  That's close to the sugars in a soda.  A person could get a sugar high or go into sugar shock (if diabetic) with this level of sugar.  I finally stumbled upon unsweetened Almond Breeze vanilla which has 4 grams of carbs and So Delicious vanilla coconut milk which has 9 grams of carbs.  I still have half a dozen sugary rice milks that I'm watering down with homemade almond milk just to reduce the terrifying sugar level.  Unsweetened Almond Breeze tastes smooth and nutty, and regular so Delicious both tastes smooth and somewhat coconutty.  You can even mix the two and even add some rice milk, but rice milk alone is too high in sugars.

review/text: Rice milk isn't my favorite non-dairy milk, but I still occasionally drink it. It's a lot thinner than soy milk, so sometimes I like to cook with it. Unless you get non-sweetened, I feel like Rice Dream really adds too much sugar. It's hard to drink straight, sometimes I like to mix it with a non-sweetened variety. It might be good for sometime new to the non-dairy milk world.

review/text: I had to leave a review after reading some of the negative ones. I can't use soy or dairy so finding a milk substitute has been interesting. Many of the soy alternatives still list some soy in their ingredient list. This particular Rice Dream rice milk (organic, enriched, original) does not. Further, it is the closest to dairy milk that I have found and doesn't add it's own flavor to whatever you cook like almond (I like almond milk for some things) or hemp milks do. You certainly can live without the 8 ounce size but they sure are convenient. I do hope that Amazon gets this size back again.

review/summary: Worth it
review/text: As a mom of a child with dairy allergies, it's very hard to travel without this product. The small boxes are very convenient, and being that many times the original formula of this milk is hard to find, I'm assured that I have it available when we are out. Yes, a little pricey, but worth it.

review/summary: Rice Dream
review/text: This rice drink is healthy and delicious. A great dairy and soy alternative, this rice drink is great to drink by itself, to use in baking, and to use as a creamer in tea and coffee drinks.

review/summary: Not Gluten Free - Pacific Rice Milk is Gluten Free
review/text: Thank you, Amazon for listing barley in Rice Dream's ingredients.  It is sad that Rice Dream does not list the barley on their packages.  My 15-month-old son has to be on a gluten free diet.  Rice Dream was sabotaging our efforts.  As a thank you to Amazon.com, I purchase cases of Pacific Rice milk from Amazon.  I also save money from purchasing it online than locally.  We have enjoyed Rice Dream for years but if you need to be on a gluten free diet, this is not the product for you.  Purchase Pacific Rice milk.

review/summary: Better Than OTC Laxatives
review/text: Not only is this tea good tasting, but it works great as a laxative.  I don't drink this tea every day, but only when I need to restore regularity when I travel.  I always bring a few convenient to pack tea bags with me when I expect to be out of town for more than a few days.

review/summary: use a liquer instead
review/text: This extract has a very strong alcohol aroma, so much so that it is difficult to discern any pistachio flavor. You might as well use a liquer instead- you'd probably get a better flavor.
