review/summary: Awesome "to-go" snack for toddlers
review/text: This is a perfectly healthy, portable and vitamin packed snack for toddlers.  My one year old loves them.  I wish the cap was just a tad bigger because the first thing he wants to do is play with it, however (much like the warning on the product says) it is too small and poses a chocking hazzard.  I love that he can either squeeze it himself or just suck the yogurt out of the opening.  The size is appropriate, for a snack, and the ease of just tossing into the diaper bag can't be beat.  It's a better deal to order on Amazon (especially subscribe and save) than purchasing in the grocery store, but still a slightly high priced snack.

review/text: I fed this to my 8 month old (his first time having yogurt) and he loved it. He ate the whole package very eagerly and was quite vocal while doing so. I tasted it and thought it tasted ok, not like "perfume" as one reviewer said. No, it is not very sweet because it doesn't contain added sugar, so the yogurt flavor is a little bitter.

review/text: My daughter's lips sealed shut like an air-lock door after the first bite. I thought she was just cranky so I persevered - how bad can peach yogurt be?  Eventually she was wearing most of it... The dog was licking up the rest under her highchair. I ventured a taste of some that she had quite literally spat onto my face, LOL! It was so bad I had to get my husband and older kids to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't just off. We all agreed - this gnarly concoction tastes like yogurt perfume!

review/summary: Have your noodles al dente
review/text: I'm under the weather and the "green" sections of my local grocery stores (yes stores) were ALL out of the vegan soup I like.  So I chose to try this particular soup for its lower calories, vegan fair, ingredient list and o.k. sodium content.  I followed the stove top directions only adding a smidge of the oil packet and cooking for about 1.5 minutes instead of 3.  (I've had problems with rice noodles in the past and I didn't want to eat slimy noodles).  I couldn't believe HOW GOOD this was-especially for the price point.  I had bought 4 soups total to make up for the one I couldn't get and I wanted to make sure that if any were gross I could have others to fall back on.  Oddly, this was my first choice and I didn't need to try another.  How grateful I was to find this soup.  I will continue to buy it AND encourage others to do the same.

review/summary: Maybe it's just me?
review/text: This is the second time that I've tried Thai Kitchen noodles and both times it was kind of gross. I really wanted to like them because they're vegetarian, but they just taste off to me. Maybe I'm getting really old packs or something? Maybe they're just too bland for me. Yes, I followed the directions and put in all the seasonings. I might try it again with barely any water in it and see if it tastes better.<br /><br />____________________________________________<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />Okay. I tried the Spring Onion again, but this time I boiled the noodles for about 5 minutes, drained all the water, added the oil and seasonings and mixed. It actually tasted pretty good this way. There was no weird off flavor this time. I added some crushed red pepper to make it spicier. I actually enjoyed the noodles today. I would just recommend trying to eat it soon after cooking if you drain the water because the noodles will start to stick together. Hope this helps.

review/summary: Delicious Spring Onion Soup!
review/text: Absolutely delicious, light, gluten-free, low calorie, inexpensive lunch! I am on a perpetual diet, and nothing has made me happier than this soup. I like ramen soup, but the problem with regular Maruchan ramen is that it has msg and wheat (gluten) and also twice the sodium per packet and its preserved with TBHQ. All of which is bad for me. Also ramen is fried, these rice noodles are steam cooked, not fried. And I like the fact that they put two flavor packets, one is the soup mix and the other is the spicy oil, so if your kids don't like hot spicy, they don't have to add the spicy oil packet. Great, right?<br /><br />The price works out best if you get the box of 72 from Amazon. This package of 12 actually works out to be a little more expensive than the supermarket, but still worth it if your supermarket doesn't carry it.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: You may think you like anchovies, but you've never had anchovies if you haven't had these.<br /><br />Packed in salt, these anchovies come to us from the famous Amalfi Coast of Italy. There's more delicious anchovy flavor in one of these than in ten of the usual canned/tinned anchovy fillets. We use them on pizza, in pasta with pesto, and anywhere else a bit (or a lot) of anchovy flavor is welcome. And a little bit goes a _long_ way.<br /><br />As you take them out of the jar, rinse them in cold water. They're already sliced open at the stomach, but unless you like your anchovies crunchier than we do, you'll want to finish the filleting job: cut off the heads and tails, slice them the rest of the way open, and carefully peel out their little fishy spines and ribs (and a couple bits of squidgy fish organ). You can also scrape off the scales if you like.<br /><br />Just be aware that because their flavor is so strong, it may take you a long time to use up a whole jar. Once the jar is open, use them as quickly as you can -- and you might want to consider storing some of them in smaller jars or other containers, covered with salt (or maybe olive oil) and tightly sealed. We're planning to divide our next jar into smaller portions and try freezing them.<br /><br />(EDIT: We did try freezing them in small batches; they kept fine for several months, but then they got soft and we didn't trust them any more. Probably they'd have been safer preserved in salt.)

review/summary: Great Curry for the price
review/text: Bottom Line:<br />Absolute kickbutt value for your money, very authentic and spicy enough where spice lovers will nod their heads and smile.  For those who avoid spice and salt, use lots of yogurt or powdered milk and also you can add cheese like queso blanco or queso fresco (if you don't mind it crumbly) if you don't have paneer.  I didn't use any butter as I felt there was no need to.<br /><br />Review:<br />So I bought a gigantic bag of Royal Basmati rice and wanted something to eat with it.  I saw the rave reviews for this curry and yet had soso expectations.  I live very close to an excellent punjab, restaurant and live with someone who cooks some of the best curries ever.  The only reason why I'd eat this is if it's decent and it can help me make great curries.  Therefore when I made it I was surprised this tasted very very good.  It can sit comfortably prepared in an indian restaurant and no one would complain.<br /><br />Timothy B. Riley did a excellent suggestion for cooking this properly however also listed ingredients that I need to buy online and don't have readily available.<br /><br />In addition I don't have any chicken and a left with gravy that would be very spicy.  Therefore, for my version, I add about 1/2 cup of skim milk powder mixed with a little bit of water, queso fresco cheese, generous amounts of cumin as well as some kefir yogurt to garnish.  I did try adding frozen spinach and it may be too strong for some so cannot recommend.<br /><br />As for why queso fresco cheese and not making my own paneer (which is very easy, look for it on food network) I have the very embarrassing habit of eating all the curds when the cheese is straining.  I am a BONAFIDE cheese addict and am my own worst enemy when it comes to cheese making.  I imagine others may be the same or may simply be too busy so look out for queso fresco or better yet queso blanco in your hispanic markets.  Otherwise you're forced to be like me and make paneer only when you're very very full.

review/text: I enjoy Indian food but unfortunately the closest Indian restaurant is 150 miles away from my house. I've tried other commercial Indian food products and have not been very pleased. The Kitchens of India Butter Chicken Curry, however, is tasty, just spicy enough for me (well, maybe a little on the mild side), and easy to make. I buy the Costco rotisserie chicken, debone it, put it in 1 pound zip-lock bags, and freeze them. Each envelope of the Butter Curry needs 1 pound of chicken, so I just pop the chicken out of the freezer, defrost it, add the curry paste and butter, and in about 20 minutes I have a delicious dinner. I will definitely be ordering this product again.

review/summary: Vegetarian dish after some changes
review/text: We love Indian food but I was always hesitant to make it at home because there are so many great Indian restaurants out there.<br /><br />  I just made this dish tonight for dinner.  Being vegetarian, I made some changes and the dish turned out great.  I sauteed one large chopped onion in pan while steaming a lot of cut-up potatoes, cauliflower, and carrots in another pan.  To the onion pan, I added 2 packages of the butter chicken seasonings, 2 cans of light coconut milk, a little butter and 1/4 cup sugar.  After the seasonings were all dissolved, I put the steamed veggies in the onion/sauce pan and let it simmer.  I doubled the recipe because we are a family of 5 and  I wanted to have a lot to put in the fridge as leftovers for the weekend.  We eat a lot of Indian food and everyone loved this dish!<br /><br />  I googled "best naan recipe" and made homemade naan for the first time (very easy).  I served the veggie dish and naan with steamed rice and everything was fantastic!

review/text: Love this! I must admit I was pretty sketical about this product, but I read all the reviews and decided to try this product. I tried it with chicken and at the end added some fat free half and half, absolutely awesome.<br /><br />It has some spicy but not so much,just  enough. I think people could try it with fish or veggies too, the paste is very very good. I plan on buying this many more times once the 6 packet set is finished. Very easy and very tasty.

review/summary: Great taste but a little oily
review/text: My family loves the butter chicken dish this flavor packet produces, but it is a little oily out of the package, and the oil continues to separate even as you serve it. Because of this it doesn't quite look like the smooth butter chicken curry I get at Indian restaurants, but tastes great. It cooks up with your chicken in about the same time it takes to make some rice to serve it with. Easy to make even for a cooking novice.

review/text: I wouldn't call this butter chicken; it tastes a bit different and is a little more oily than the butter chicken I get from Indian restaurants in Jackson Heights.<br /><br />But...it's a VERY delicious and easy to make curry. Follow the directions and you have a very nicely spiced curry chicken. Mmm mmm mmm.<br /><br />What are the instructions? Mix water, butter (I recommend ghee), curry paste, and chicken chopped into pieces. Simmer for 20 minutes than high heat for another 5. (Don't try to cook a whole chicken -- follow the instructions and tear the chicken into pieces, please).<br /><br />Soooo good!

review/summary: First time venture
review/text: I have been to India but I have never made any traditional Indian meals.  Like another reviewer I cooked the chicken before adding the curry. I sauteed sweet onions and red baby bell peppers then cooked the chicken prior to adding the curry. My husband decided to shred the chicken to ensure a more even consistency. This was a mild curry. This turned out very well and the only reason we had leftovers was we were both so full! While we did not add the rice with this first try, I will make sticky rice for next preparation. I got this on a Gold Box deal and enjoyed so much we will do the subscribe and save.

review/summary: I have no idea how authentic it is, but I can vouch for its deliciousness
review/text: I'd never had butter chicken before trying this paste, mixed with butter, water, and some chopped-up chicken breasts, so I'm not sure how authentic it is. I AM sure that it's delicious, very flavorful and a little spicy. My husband, who is not a fan of Indian food, even the (I'm sure) butchered versions that I make from scratch, loves this stuff. We eat it roughly once a week, with jasmine rice in the bowl or naan on the side.<br /><br />The amount of chicken I use varies depending on what we have; we've used less than a pound on tight weeks, and we'll throw in a little more than a pound plus a little additional water to stretch the sauce when we need to have extras for a lunch.<br /><br />It's good enough that I'm coming back to buy another pack, which is saying a lot, because usually once we hit the end of a bulk buy from Amazon, my husband is tired of it and doesn't want to see it again -- but he asked me to get MORE butter chicken paste.

review/summary: Wow - Just perfect - a new favorite
review/text: Good curries are hard to find. This is one of them. It took me 6 months to get around to using this but now that I have I'm planning a nice dinner to cook for someone special and this will be the main dish.<br /><br />Here's what I did. I emptied the curry paste pouch into 1 cup of water. Stirred it to dissolve it. Then I took some boneless/skinless chicken breast medallions and mixed them into the curry. I put it all into a casserole dish and baked at 400 degrees (covered with foil) for 1 hour. It came out perfect. The chicken was tender and not dry. The curry taste was just right, not too hot or strong, just right. I made plain white rice to go with it. I found it hard not to eat the whole thing!

review/summary: Convenient, great flavor; would be nice if you could turn down the heat
review/text: We have a neighbor who introduced us to this dish. She makes it from scratch, and we fell in love with it. When I saw this item on sale at Amazon, I decided to try it.<br /><br />We've cooked it according to directions, and also customized it with diced onion or even peanut butter. The only complaint is that it is a bit too spicy. Wish there was a way to reduce the amount of spiciness. We tried all the ways to cut it by adding other ingredients, but they either don't help and/or they change the flavor. I'd give this 4.5 stars for the convenience + flavor if the ingredient which makes it spicy were in a separate packet which you could adjust.<br /><br />Maybe we are wimps. Try it for yourself. It goes well with Basmati rice, but any fresh rice will do. Enjoy!

review/text: This is for the butter chicken curry.  Made some of this for my mom, then the next day went to a local Indian place.  The homemade from this pouch was every bit as good as the restaurant.  There is no hint of "too much salt" like some claim.  I will order this, and others from them, again.  I also works well with pork or steak, although I prefer the chicken or pork with this spice mix though.  I also have tried adding coconut milk and it tastes awesome this way.

review/text: Ive never made curry before but I've tasted it and this comes very close to it. It taste very authentic to what I know. It is very easy to prepare. You can just add meat or you can add meat with fresh onion, bell pepper and minced garlic. This product is paste form. It makes it very easy to prepare your curry with no mess and no fuss. Very simple and hard to screw it up. My kids absolutely love this when I cook it. We even buy the Naan bread from our Walmart to go with this. It's very simple and easy to make. The taste is very delicious. You do not even need to add anymore spice to this if you don't want. I would definitely be buying this again once my 6 packs is gone. I can't afford to take my big family out to an authentic Indian restaraunt so this is the next best thing to it. Awesome job to Amazon for carrying this product and awesome job to Kitchens of India for making this. I am your new loyal fan. Now I wonder how the other flavors taste. I will have to try them too.

I don't usually add the butter as I don't think it makes much difference.  This is great and will be a staple in my house.

The veggie side, I mostly use whatever I have, but frozen cauliflower and veggie mix bags work well as well as fresh stuff.  Simmer for 20 minutes to let the sauce thicken and the paste to fully incorporate.

review/summary: Yum! Even for non-curry fans
review/text: I'm not a big fan of curry but my girlfriend loves the stuff.  I found this on a good deal so I decided to try it because of the reviews. Glad I did! It is delicious and had just the right amount of spice -not too strong like other curries where it overpowers everything else in the dish that have turned me off to the spice.  No sketchy ingredients either, a huge plus!<br /><br />Other reviewers have said they used cooked or semi cooked chicken- there is no need for this, as the recipie is designed to cook raw chicken.  I used<br />thigh pieces and it came out perfectly cooked and tender. Instead of the 3T butter called for by the recipie, I used 1T of butter and 2T of Smart Balance<br />(Light) to cut down a bit on the fat.  The extra butter probably would have made it that much better but is not needed for great taste. I served it over<br />rice, and despite the claim on the box of 4 servings, it really is only 3 assuming it is the centerpiece of your meal. Buy it!

review/summary: Definitely a HIT in our kitchen!
review/text: Even though it seemed to have mostly great reviews, I didn't have super high expectations for this packet mix...but it ended up knocking my socks off! It had a really nice taste with just enough hint of heat to be tasty but not overpowering. I do have a cooking suggestion, however--I followed the directions to the T (I always do the first time I make something like this) and I ended up having a hard time mixing the paste in quick enough because it really is a thick paste and it took more time that I thought for it to break down and my water was boiling away. Or something like that--I made it a few days ago and my memory isn't that great, but I just remember thinking that the next time, I'd pre-mix the water and paste outside of the pan first to make sure it's all reconstituted nicely with no lumps. I don't think there is any way you could get all the lumps out if you put the chicken in at the same time as the paste packet. ANYWAY, we had it with coconut rice and it was delish. I can't wait to make it again!

review/summary: Best curry I can find
review/text: My entire extended family gets this curry paste because it is the best we can find. I make it about once every two weeks. With rice and chicken, I easily get three large meals. Which works out to less than $2 per meal. I never add the butter as called for in the directions because it is absolutely flavorful enough without it. With subscription, it is cheaper than buying it in the grocery store.<br />I would give it more than five stars if I could.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: This is a fast, easy, tasty curry fix.  It's may be a little spicy for some people.  I'd rate it 2.5 stars on a four star hotness scale.<br /><br />I like it best made with boneless chicken thighs, but chicken breasts/tenders are OK (if a bit more dry.)  Cut the chicken into 1-2 inch pieces and throw it in the pot with the curry mixture.  You'll have 3-4 tasty meals in about twenty minutes.  I like to serve it over rice, but naan is fine.  Leftovers are good too.<br /><br />Personally, I'd rate it 4-1/2 stars, but that wasn't an option.  I eat this 3-4 times a month.<br /><br />Their other dishes are nice too, but this is my favorite.

review/text: This stuff is good. People who have never tasted curry love it. People who've had curry loved it. It's simple to make and a cheap way to have something "exotic".<br /><br />My husband, who eats like a bird and doesn't like most kinds of curry, will stuff himself into oblivion with this. He can actually eat more of this stuff than I can, and I am usually the one who can eat more in one sitting...<br /><br />Recommend it. Totally and completely worth the money. You will not regret this deliciousness! :D

review/text: This product must be Kitchens of India's flagship product.  It is hands down by far the tastiest of all of their products by a wide margin.  I recommend this item first over on top of any of their other products because it will become your "gateway drug" to Kitchens of India products.  Medium spice, superb flavor.  Cooking this with an additional sliced onion makes it even better.

review/summary: Surprising good butter chicken curry from a pouch!
review/text: I purchased this on sale after seeing all of the great reviews on Amazon not really expecting much. Although there are many great Indian restaurants in New York sometimes I neither have the time or inclination to go out nor do I have many good indian restaurants locally that deliver.<br /><br />With that in mind I took the plunge on KOIs Butter Chicken Curry. Preparation was simple, so simple that I was even more suspect than when I originally purchased. Based on recommendation of some of the reviewers I added additional liquid (1 cup of water and 1 cup of 1% milk) and sauteed my soy curls ahead of time. I found that adding the additional liquid help dissipate some of the saltyness of the pouch. I also added some fresh garlic in the beginning and garnished with cilantro at the end.<br /><br />The taste was as good as many of the restaurants on 6th street (indian row) in New York, very easy to prepare, and at a fraction of the cost of eating out. Grab some frozen naan from trader joes and whip up some jasmin or basmati rice and you have yourself a quick and tasty indian meal.<br /><br />One star off for the salt content but otherwise this is now a household staple.

review/text: I don't usually have to cook for myself because my wife does the job. i bought this to keep at home as a standby and it came in handy when my wife went away for a trip during the weekend and i had to cook for myself. Even as an inexperience cook, this is no challenge to make. The instructions are clear and was prepared quickly. I am Indian and have to admit that the taste is not too authentic but still, it has got great flavor in it and is pretty good for people who can eat spicy food.

review/summary: Use double the water to reduce salt
review/text: These pastes are so good and so easy. I bought the butter chicken paste only because it had the lowest sodium count of all their pastes, but I have yet to actually make it with chicken! I also use two cups of water instead of one and it doesn't taste watered down at all (I don't add butter either). Last night I cut a large yam into 1-1/2" cubes, sliced a kielbasa into coin-size pieces and cooked as directed (but with the 2 cups of water). Served it over rice. May not be traditional but it was tasty and couldn't be easier. The yams thicken up the sauce nicely too (regular potatoes would probably do so too).

review/text: Firstly, I'm an American and have never been to India.  I do work with a lot of Indians however, and go to local Indian restaurants for lunch with them or to places they recommend.<br /><br />One of my favorites at the Indian restaurants has always been the Butter Chicken (all varieties).  I wasn't expecting much, but based on the reviews and the fact that the price was right, I decided to give this product a chance.  I have to say I am very pleasantly surprised.  This comes very close to what I've had at Indian restaurants.  Not only was it easy to prepare, it was very tasty.  I served it over white rice.  Even my extremely children liked it.  Definitely a keeper.  The best part is that I have 5 more packages left!  For $8ish for the 6-pack of curry paste, you can't go wrong.

I liked that it was spicier than the restaurant version, but not overly so. Next time I think I will throw in a few cubed potatoes and some veggies. Basmati rice is a must :) Thank you so much Kitchens of India!! And many thanks to Amazon to carrying it for an extremely competitive price. A *must* buy!!

review/text: hi, i've never attempted curry.  at the simplest add water, butter, and chicken.<br /><br />i must say i was happy with my first attempt.  i added frozen veggies/onions and frozen chicken strips from costco.  i was impressed.  i'm not picky when it comes to food but i thought it was delicious.  a lady friend thought the same thing.  we ate it over white rice.<br /><br />my second attempt wasn't as goo.  i tried it with potatoes, onions, and vietnamese pressed pork (given to me by my priest).  i think the sweetness of the onions and the blandness of the pork subdued some of the flavor and kick.  nonetheless, i still liked it.<br /><br />my next attempt i will try using milk instead of water. does anyone know what i can add to make it a lil more spicy?  any help is appreciated.  i got a pack of 6 for ~$5.  definitely worth trying out.

review/summary: Needs A Bit of Tweking for My Taste
review/text: I do believe that this is the best store bought Indian Food product that I have up until today tried. I did find it a bit too spicy for my liking and my kids couldn't eat it all even with added yogurt. I think I will use less butter next time and add milk instead of water. I would like to try potatoes or maybe chickpeas along with the chicken and saute some onions or shallots.<br /><br />I have tried the Kitchens Of India Vegetable Biryani Paste and it was so hot as to be inedible for me. This was not nearly that spicy and I could taste the flavors. I think the salt was overboard too, but that isn't a huge concern for me.<br /><br />Another favorite of mine is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R9L4M">Tasty Bite Madras Lentils Entree, Heat & Eat, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. It has a nice flavor with only a hint of after-burn. Once again my kids couldn't eat it, but it's especially good with a little shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream as a dip.

review/summary: ALMOST AS GOOD AS MY FAVORITE INDIAN RESTAURANT!!
review/text: This has no meat in it--it is a curry paste/simmer sauce for your meat of choice. We had boneless pork chops on hand, so we diced the pork and used it instead of chicken. No biggie! You could use any meat in this, or frozen peas, potatoes and mushrooms for a vegetarian meal. We do like creamy curries here in Cincinnati, so at the very end of cooking, we added some heavy whipping cream (you could also use half and half or evaporated/canned milk.) Awesomely good, spicy but not too hot, and great depth of flavor! I am ordering more.

review/text: ...Kitchens of India Butter Chicken Curry Paste!!!<br />I ordered this curry for two main reasons: I've been thinking about trying to cook an Indian dish and it would get here in three days, thanks to free TwoDay Shipping as a student on Amazon. I did the research, read all 83 reviews, and went ahead and decided to purchase. It got here yesterday and it is simply amazing.<br />I altered the recipe a little bit due to some reviewer's noting that it salty and spicy. Seems like the kind of thing you can do your own thing with. I'm a college kid cooking for myself and so I need each pack to make a stew that will last longer than just that night's dinner. With that in mind, I did the following<br />  ~ love onions so I dumped about half a small white onion and the 3tablespoons butter in and let that cook for a little while<br />  ~ next added chicken because africans don't just toss raw chicken into sauce. I let it brown pretty well on both sides (5mins approx). and it was 1 and a half whole chicken breast cut up into fairly big pieces.<br />  ~ substituted '1 cup water' for a little less than half a pint of Shamrock Heavy Cream (let that sit for 10mins or so) and by this time the heat is way low as to not curdle the milk, and because I wanted the chicken to be more than 1/2 way done. also tossed in lots of peas and carrots in tiny bitesized pieces.<br />  ~ now the paste and two whole basil leaves!<br />  ~ I added about 3/4 teaspons of flour to thicken it slightly, and water as I saw fit. Simmered for 15mins after the addition of paste.<br />The end result was a curry that is slightly sweet, a little creamy, and very much what the Kitchens of India served up! I don't know what anyone's 'hot meter' is comparable to mine but Africans like it hot and Southwest food is pretty hot! This was tame in comparison - maybe a 4 out of 10 - but I liked it that way. I have a subscription but it looks like one pack is enough to last me at least 4 days! I would certainly recommend this to anyone with a hankering for curry. It was really quite delicious.<br /><br />Pros - slightly sweet thick curry, easy to make, directions were clear (even if i altered them), quick prep time for the chicken and everything else I put in.<br />Cons - none! I'm not tempted to try it with just water to get the full effect of spice or salt. But I'm sure I'd like it too!

review/text: I made this for my husband using bite-size pieces of lean pork, and the meat came out unbelievably tender. It took a little less time to cook than the chicken, probably about 15 min. In the morning, I put some brown rice in the rice cooker, used vegetable broth instead of water, and set the timer for 6:00 pm. While the meat was cooking, I threw some frozen spinach in the microwave. I put the rice and spinach on a plate and topped it with the wonderful curry. So we had a great meal prepared in less than 20 min.

Easy.  I've made it different ways - like the directions, but have also added onions & other vegetables & put the mixture over rice & pasta.  I'm lucky in that my kids eat just about everything (vegetables, spicy food, etc.), so this meal is always gobbled down no matter what I add to the mixture.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this purchase & will buy again.

review/summary: Why eat out ?!?  This stuff is GREAT !!
review/text: I spent a year living in New Delhi, and developed quite a fondness for Indian food.  This is as close as I have *ever* come to recreating the restaurant fare at home.  Easy to use, reasonable price, and the quality and taste are VERY VERY GOOD.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/summary: quick and tasty
review/text: I had purchased this product at a closeout store, and really liked it, but unable to find in the local grocery, so was happy to find it on Amazon.  The flavor is spicy, but not overwhelming, and an easy way to make a quick dinner. The consistency is just right for serving over rice.

review/summary: Makes a superb dish!
review/text: I followed the instructions precisely, with the only change being (at the suggestion of my 19 year-old nephew) to add raisins about 5 minutes before serving.  Everyone loved this dish - especially my 14 year-old niece. She saved the leftovers and ate them later in the evening.<br /><br />This dish has just the right amount of 'bite' to it, and we enjoyed it with rice and some steamed vegetables.  Contrary to its name, it is not greasy, oily or high fat.  Just v-e-r-y good!

review/summary: So simple and good
review/text: I found this product locally at our Albertson's several years ago.  They stopped carrying it.  I was so glad to find it here.  I use the microwave directions and it comes out perfect.  Serve with some Jasmine rice and a simple veggie.  The flavor is yummy and leftovers are great warmed up in the sauce.  Now I've got plenty in my pantry.

review/summary: Super tasty - and the 4 year old liked it too!
review/text: Tried this recently based on the ++ reviews.  We enjoyed it with chicken over rice. The seasonings were very complex - with a medium heat (by our tastes).  My 4 year old son, who can be a picky eater ate 2 helpings and has asked when we'll have it again.  I had the leftovers for lunch the next day and the chicken was even more tender.

review/summary: Believe the reviews!
review/text: I had never tried this particular product before. I rely heavily on your customers reviews, and I must say I have never seen a food item get this much positive feedback. Anyway, I thought I would give it a try....and boy am I glad I did. It was an instant hit with the whole family! We'll definitely be ordering it again.
