review/summary: Packaging Problem
review/text: While the food is good quality, it doesn't always arrive in great shape due to insufficient packaging. The shipping box is large enough, but there is never enough tape on it to keep it from opening up due to the heavy weight of the product. Every box I have ever received of this, and I have gotten about 4-5 of them, has been partially, sometimes mostly open and ripped. One bag of the food actually came with a rip in the food bag that someone then taped up with packing tape before mailing. That is totally unacceptable for a food item. I will be buying this from a nearby pet store from now on even though it is more expensive and a 25 minutes drive. Having to take a heavy package like this to the post office to return just isn't worth it.

review/summary: Barry's Tea
review/text: If you are a lover of Irish and English teas, then this is the product for you.  The Barry's tea is a perennial favorite among the Irish.  We have shared many a cup with my wife's family and friends over the years.  It is true that Barry's tea helps them freshen up and find the right words to express themselves. There's nothing that can't be solved over a cup of tea with friends or family.

review/summary: bold and strong
review/text: I grew up drinking tea that my mom brought home from Ireland.  Having visited Ireland as a kid, I got addicted to tea, but American tea just isn't strong enough to match the Gold tea my mom liked best.  I think this Barry's tea is now my new favorite.  I've been to England to visit cousins, but they were drinking P.G. Tips.  P.G. Tips was okay until I found Barry's tea.  I like bold coffee and apparently bold tea.

review/summary: hmm... dogs enjoy, but there are healthier liver treat options
review/text: My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is "made with liver".<br /><br />My dogs absolutely love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000255OIG">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried 14 Ounce</a> (the larger size packages are more economical). I just feel a lot better about feeding real freeze-dried liver that doesn't have all the extra junk in Bil-Jac liver treats.<br /><br />Specifically, these treats have chicken "by-products"-- that means liquid slaughterhouse run-off and other non-human grade leftovers from the slaughterhouse. UGH! Bil-Jac also includes three preservatives, glycerin (?!), and the corn syrup.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the ingredient list for Bil-Jac liver treats, so you can make your own decision:<br /><br />Liver, Chicken By-Products, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn, Chicken Fat, Glycerin, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Flour, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Sodium Propionate and Potassium Sorbate and BHA and Citric Acid (Preservatives), Iron Oxide.

review/text: This is a great baking powder, and it's also nice in that it's aluminum free. I'll fully admit I'd not noticed the inclusion of it in other baking powders I've bought, but then, I never looked at the label of them until I purchased this one. It works well, and this is a great way to get it in bulk if you do a fair amount of baking, or even just a fair amount of pancakes/waffles. This (as opposed to their baking soda) is the product Bob's Red Mill ought to put the "Aluminum Free" label on, given that a lot of baking sodas are now aluminum free. I generally store it in the fridge when not in use, and store the extra unopened packages in the freezer until we're ready to open them. It's a great way to get baking powder for all the baking, waffles, and pancakes around our house!

I will be looking for more such items in the future. You can easily give as gifts too.

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill - Thumbs Up!
review/text: This baking powder does not include aluminum.  I never knew some baking powders used aluminum.  How many years have I been putting metal into my baked goods?  Yikes!! That doesn't sit well with me.<br /><br />I've lately become aware of the way our food is being grown and processed in the US.  The use of genetically modified or genetically engineered wheat, corn, soy, canola, etc. is frightening!!  My friend, Patt, calls it "Franken Food".  Our gov't does not require manufacturers to label ingredients that are sourced GMO or GE (European and Asian gov'ts require it).  Consumers need to be self advocates for their own health and the health of their families.  That's why I love Amazon.com and Bob's Red Mill.  The prices are competitive and the variety is endless.  Thanks for providing options for families!

review/summary: The taste is good and you cannot beat the price
review/text: Spices command a pretty penny. I typically buy large containers of spice from Costco.  Costco has a very limited line and after running out of ginger, I was blown away by the supermarket prices for ginger -- typically five dollars for an ounce to an ounce and a half.  I was very pleased to find this product.  I use ginger frequently and you get twice as much product for what you would spend at the supermarket.  A low price doesn't mean much if the flavor is poor.  I was happy with the flavoring.  It yielded the flavor profile that I wanted.  I'm happy that the company sells other options like cilantro, which is a high-cost dried herb.  If you cook a lot with spices and herbs, I would consider this company.<br /><br />Note: If you want to save even more money, order directly from the company.  Google Marshalls Creek Spices to find more spices from this company.  The ginger on their website is under five dollars for six ounces but there is a higher shipping cost.  So this option is probably better for those that want several bottles of spices.

review/summary: Not the puppy food for us
review/text: This did not work for our puppy.  It left her with quite the upset tummy.  It was the food she came home from the breeder on, but something must have changed when she got home.  We have since made the switch to eukanuba and she is a much happier pup!  Plus, I am happier too since I'm no longer cleaning up after her all the time!  As always, Amazon was great, but I would not recommend this food for your puppy.

review/summary: Not a quality dog food
review/text: This dog food has all the ingredients you don't want in a dog food - corn, by-products, etc.  For about the same price, Diamond has their Naturals line that is MUCH BETTER in terms of quality.  Diamond Naturals Puppy food doesn't have corn or by-products.<br /><br />I honestly don't know why Diamond puts out this awful dog food when they can make quality ones for right about the same price - given the choice, who would take the one for less quality?<br /><br />Our puppy was on this when we got her, we bought a small bag and slowly changed her food to the Diamond Naturals for Large Breed puppies, and the difference is fantastic.  We'll stick with the Naturals, and never have her go back to this variety.

review/summary: Madame Poops-a-lot
review/text: I have a 7-month old terrier/german shep mix (a pound puppy, yes) who seems like she's going to end up around 50 or 60 pounds. I did a lot of research before I went with this brand - I can't afford the high-end food but don't want to settle for cheap stuff just cuz the price is right and this fell right in the middle. It came highly recommended and comes out to about a dollar a day for Betsy. She likes it and seems to be benefitting from it - her coat looks nice, her body is filling out in the right places but she's not fat at all. However, I have never seen a dog poop soooooo much! At first I thought it was just the change in her diet - from street food to good food - but she's been on it for almost 2 months now and it's not letting up. She's healthy, has had all her shots, is in great condition, and eats the right amount according to the chart on the bag. But wow! I was under the impression that the better the food the LESS they poop... not the case with this. At least 3 times a day, minimum, and lots of it. I can only attribute it to the food and will change it when this second bag is gone.

review/summary: Yes, it's great--and here is its pedigree!
review/text: What made me think to search for this stuff on Amazon? Happy memories, I guess. We used to go for beer and pretzels to a pubby place called the Train Station in my college days at Penn State--and for me, Herlocher's mustard, served with pretzels, was as big a draw as the beer.<br /><br />The name of the folks who owned the Train Station? The Herlochers! Yes, this mustard was their house recipe. I can even remember when they started bottling and selling it across the counter, and then in local groceries. (As the label graphics practically shout, it was the late '70s.) A star was born! Not really...I'm a bit disappointed that Herlocher's never took off as I thought it might.<br /><br />Anyway, it's wonderful stuff, better than any other sweet dipping mustard I know. (Except for my Dad's home-made stuff.) Herlocher's secret, I think, is the eggs.<br /><br />I've still never used it for anything beyond pretzel dipping, which it suits perfectly, but other reviewers have testified to Herlocher's versatility.<br /><br />It's great to have rediscovered an old favorite--and to help promote an example of fine central Pennsylvania cuisine!

Finally looked on line for this mustard because we loved it.  Bought 4 jars.  It's a bit sweet, a bit tangy, a bit mustardy!!  Great with pretzels.  We also put the mustard on ham when we cooked it and it was yummy.

review/summary: Makes great appetizer!
review/text: This makes a tasty, easy appetizer.  It is the BEST dipping mustard!!!!  I don't like mustard, but this is the only one I will eat.  I was introduced to Herlocher's Dipping Mustard in a sampling display, at a grocery store in Dayton, OH.  They served it with pretzel sticks, that served as skewers for chucks of summer sausage & Monterey Jack cheese.  It wasn't too sweet or tart.  I was amazed that FINALLY I found a mustard i liked!<br /><br />I continued to purchase this produce until I moved back to Minneapolis in 1992.  Fortunately, I kept an empty jar so I could look for it in MN.  No luck.  I then tried numerous honey mustard, sweet mustard and various other flavors, hoping to find something similar.  I ended up throwing them all out.<br /><br />Just recently, I thought I'd check online to see if I could order it direct.  That's when I found in on Amazon.  I ordered several jars.  -Ended up eating a whole one myself!  I'm bringing it to our Thanksgiving gathering today to introduce it to my family.  I also plan to give additional jars as hostess gifts this Holiday Season, along with my story.  This is the 1st review I've ever written about a product.  Hope someone reads it & becomes hooked on this mustard as I have!

review/text: You have no idea how many salchichon sandwiches I consumed while in Spain. Neither do I but it was a lot. Salchichon is somewhat like a hard salami but milder and less greasy. This particular product is pretty close to the salchichones I had in Spain. I prefer salchichon to chorizo for sandwiches but I prefer chorizo for eating as-is. Now someone just needs to open a good bakery around here that makes a good so-called "french" bread like the ones I had in Spain.

review/summary: It's not my favorite.
review/text: I am trying to find a great chai to make at home when I am not treating myself to a Starbuck's chai. I was drinking Pacific Chai (spicy) for a long time which I liked for the most part. (I made it into a vanilla chai by adding a 1/2 tsp of French Vanilla coffee-mate creamer to about a 10-oz cup of water, with 3 tbs of chai powder, while in the blender.) After a year or so, I wanted to try something different because the Pacific Chai containers were always 3/4 full - it became annoying. But it turns out that some other brands are the same.<br /> I love vanilla chai but I didn't prefer the Pacific vanilla chai because it wasn't spicy enough, and the same thing goes for Big Train Chai Vanilla - not spicy enough. Also, Mocafe Vanilla Chai is too weak.<br /> I tried to convert Big Train Spiced Chai into vanilla chai by adding several drops of vanilla extract and some cinnamon but I just did not like it with or without these extras.<br /> I would love to find the perfect vanilla chai that has great spicy flavor.<br /><br />(I always make my chai in the blender using about 10-oz of water only and 3tbs of chai powder. Sometimes, I may add a bit of vanilla creamer for flavor, and/or some cinnamon.)

review/text: For anyone who likes chai, this is the best I have ever tasted.  Yes I have tried quite a variety of brands.  This beats them hands down.  Any friend I have served it to also loved it.  The Big Train Spiced is my favorite but I have also tried the chocolate, raspberry and vanilla.  The spiced flavor keeps me coming back.  I also buy it in quanity because I drink it regularily, but also because it is the best value especially through Amazon.  I take advantage of the free shipping by ordering enough product to qualify and because it stays fresh for a long time.  If you haven't tried this brand yet, it is time you did.

review/text: I use to buy "Trader Joe" spicy chai tea, but it was getting expensive because I live in Arkansas and there are no Trader Joe's around, so I would have my sister-in-law buy it and bring to me from Atlanta when she visited, well it was such a hassle.  So, I set out to find another Chai latte and tried Big Train, and lol' and behold it is every bit as good or better than Trader Joe's (not to mention more cost effective).  Also, I was at the airport and decided to get a Starbucks Chai Tea Latte while I waited for my flight, I don't know if it was the little girl that made it or just "Starbucks" in general, but it was terrible, I took one sip and threw away my $4.50 latte...yuck...and as cheap as I am, that really hurt!!

review/summary: The Chai of Dreams.
review/text: Seriously, this is the chai of my dreams. I can't stop drinking it. I can't stop raving about it. I can't stop inviting my friends over so they can share the love! As a chai-drinking connoisseur, I could not ask for a more perfectly spicy, creamy, rich, flavorful tea; even my friends who are usually unimpressed by chai have been totally enchanted by Big Train's amazing concoction. My roommate, who falls into the "usually unimpressed" category, couldn't understand why I was so excited about getting a colossal supply of tea mix in the mail... until I offered her a cup of it. I believe the words that came out of her mouth next were "Oh. My. God."<br /><br />At first I thought that two big cans of chai mix would be too much, but it's the perfect size for a chai lover like me to enjoy with an entourage of fellow tea drinkers. I can't imagine having too much of this stuff.<br /><br />The downside? Lesser chais will no longer do the trick. Small price to pay for perfection.

I recently got a new shipment in the mail this week after having gone weeks without my chai, believe me it was an exciting event around here.  They aren't kidding when they call it "liquid dessert."  It is pure comfort-in-a-mug.  I love it so much I wrote a letter last week to the company's president telling him so, and I also asked for a job while I was at it, offering to be a sales rep.

review/text: I wanted a chai that I could use on the run, at work, in the car and when traveling.  Big Train not only has strong chai flavors, it can be used solely with water because it has milk products and sweetener in the powder.  It will not replace the flavor of a high quality tea bag, but it is the next best.  When I am at home I actually use a tea bag and this powder for sweetener.  Hot Big Train Chai on a cold morning is delightful!

review/summary: big trian spiced chai
review/text: It isn't sold in powder form at the store I usually get it. I was excited to find it on amazon. I got 2 coffee can sized containers. It is the best chai tea. I love it because it doesn't go bad in a month like the liquid kind. You just add it to hot water and drink. It is very yummy.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I work night shift in ICU and sometimes need a jump start to get my evening going.  I start it with Chamba Spiced Chai Latte in a mug.  16oz mug of it takes about 1 hour to drink slowly. I find this product to have a excellent taste!  Typically I have been drinking oregon Chai and Tazo chai and getting them in the liquid form.  I have to mix them with milk or some type of soy product for it to taste any good.  Therefore I have to carry 2 different liquids to work that would spoil if not refrigerated.  Big train comes in powder form.  At first I did not want to try it with water as I mix all my chai in some form of milk/soy.  I also will not drink hot coccoa if it has been mixed with water.  Its just my taste preference.  So for me, this product is easily stored in my locker as its powder, I mix it with water and it tastes great!  Better than other store bought or the regular Starbucks $3.95 Chai Latte I usually purchase.  So hands down this is a favorite for me.  Finding places to purchase it has been a slight problem.  Went to the companies website and they list it at Albertsons and Raulphs.  I went to both here in town and neither carry it.  Costco also carries it, but did not find it there either.  So purchasing online seems to be my only avenue to obtain.  Pricing has been mixed for the 3 lb/48oz powder form from $14 to $32 then shipping added.  I will continue to search for the best/cheapest to purchase as 1 can 3lbs has lasted me now 3 months.  Good luck and hope this was helpful!

review/text: This is the best chai I've ever had in my life.  Well, except when I'm in the mood for something mellower and I get Big Train Vanilla instead.  At any rate, what a deal!  Buy two of these, get Amazon's free shipping!  What's not to love?<br /><br />Also, anyone who was disappointed in the caffeine content might look into the Spiced Decaf or Green Tea chai also made by Big Train.  I can't vouch for the decaf, but the packet of Green that I bought had 2 grams of caffeine per serving and a nice subtle minty touch added to the spicy taste we all know and love.

It's a great addition to any gift basket too!

review/text: I have long been an ardent fan of Pacific Chai teas but could no longer find it in the larger cans I liked to keep on hand.  Big Train tea is just as wonderful and relaxing.  The only down side is keeping one's consumption to a couple per day.  Great flavor, mixes easily with hot water.  Love it.

review/text: I first tasted Chai from a Dunkin Donuts and I tried unsuccessfully to find a good product to have at home. Every mix I tried was awful. Then I decided to try Amazon and I found Big Train. The reviews helped me to try it out and I am so glad. I love this brand...it is without a doubt one of the best chai's out there. The spice is just right, it is creamy whether you just add water or froth it up in a latte maker. I usually have a nice relaxing big cup every night. Kudo's Big Train!!

review/summary: Almost great - but too sweet
review/text: Let me preface this review by stating that taste is surely a subjective judgement. That being said, I think this chai mix is too sweet, and the sweetness overpowers the taste of the spices. If they'd tone down the sugar a little bit, they would have a real winner here.

review/summary: Tastes good but it's not what I thought it was.
review/text: First, let me state that this chai tastes amazing! However it is very misleading on this site when it says 99% caffeine free. On the canister it says there's 65 mg of caffeine in every 8 ounce serving! That's more caffeine than 8 ounces of Mountain Dew! I bought this in bulk (2 canisters) because I thought I could drink it at nighttime in the place of hot cocoa (14 mg of caffeine) but now it's going to take me forever to go through all this since I can only drink it in the morning! If I knew about the caffeine I probably would've tried the single packets..

review/summary: Good Stuff.
review/text: I had a sample of this before I bought it.  If you like Tastefully Simple's Chai then you'll like this.  It is also a better deal.  You get two cans (1.9 lb) for $20.  The other chai you spend $10 on one can and only get 10oz.  It is also cheaper to enjoy at home than to buy a cup on the go.  The "hot chai latte famous barista recipe" is really good on the side of the can.  The directions call for you to steam the milk into the water but if you just heat up the water and milk separately in the microwave and then pour them togeather (with the mix) you'll still get a nice froth on top.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Best Chai I've Ever Tasted
review/text: I absolutely love this chai.  It's not too sweet like the chai that is commonly sold in grocery stores and coffee shops.  It has even passed my "blind" taste test-- I had some at a small restaurant and asked the waitress what kind it was because I loved it so much.  A few months later, I noticed that Coffee Plantation, my favorite place to order chai, uses it as well.  Way better than Oregon Chai!

review/summary: Not my cup of tea
review/text: I just received my order of Big Train Chai...and right after this review, I'll be walking both canisters to the neighborhood dump. This will teach me (again) not to purchase in bulk without trying a small sample first. I had chosen Big Train because of the wonderful reviews. So it was disappointing when I made my first cup and sipped a concoction that tasted like powdered milk with a dash of pumpkin seasoning. Very chalky...like cheap, instant cocoa mix. The blend of seasonings is more reminiscent of pumpkin pie than chai and has none of the peppery goodness that I enjoy so much. The one positive I will give is that it is a very fine grain and easily dissolves in hot water.

To my delight, I found this 2-pack and snapped it up- I have gone through six cans now and have more on the way. It's a great drink for a cold evening, because it has no caffiene and is deliciously sweet. I like to make mine with milk, it makes it creamier and tastes like heaven. Buy some!

review/text: I bought the two-pack of this Spiced Chai mix on May 7th, and here it is almost exactly one month later and I've already run out and am back here ordering more.  It's very good, much better than I thought it'd be.  I have an espresso machine and using the steam wand to make a Chai latte during lunch has become a favorite part of my daily ritual.  0.3 litres of water, 0.1 litres of milk and 1.5 scoops of the mix in a glass steamed until hot is wonderful.  It's also good without the milk and also good iced, though keep in mind you have to make it hot first then add ice -- the mix won't combine with cold water directly.<br /><br />The flavor is very nice and reminds me a lot of Thanksgiving and pumpkin pie.  It's not overly spicy, just very pleasant.  The caffeine doesn't seem especially high either as I never feel wired after having a large glass.  I highly recommend it, especially as a steamed Chai latte.

This chai is very low in caffeine as advertised. I am sensitive to caffeine so this is perfect for me to drink. I don't know where the person got their info about it having 65mg of caffeine bc that is simply not true. When I worked at the coffee shop, the distributor even showed us info straight from Big Train Chai and how it has less caffeine than decaf coffee. I make mine with milk and love it! I bought it as a Christmas gift for a friend who also misses this chai. She is going to be thrilled I found it on amazon.com!
