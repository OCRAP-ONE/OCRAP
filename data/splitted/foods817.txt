review/summary: These are great....
review/text: My husband and I really like these meals.  They are so convenient when you're in a rush and we love the taste.<br />Have to say that the serving size is a little off, or maybe we're just overeaters.  We use 2 boxes with rice on the<br />side, cucs and yogurt, a little chutney and naan (or pita if we don't have any). High in fat so don't have as often<br />as we'd like.

review/summary: Ok for sauce, too salty
review/text: These are intended to be little lunches but I can't eat them by themselves.  They are basically ethnic mush in a bag and as some reviewers have said, very salty. If you have some rice or other food to pour this on top of, then they would be better.  Otherwise you have to pretend you are eating salty soup.

review/summary: Pretty much all taste the same.
review/text: I've tried 4 out of the 6 packets.<br /><br />The worst one was the Dal Bukhara. It was hard to get past the paste like consistency and the overwhelmingly bad taste of which I could only identify the butter ingredient with my tongue.<br /><br />The Navratan Korma and Pav Bhaji taste about the same. Basically nothing like the dishes of the same name I've tried at home or at local Indian restaurants.<br /><br />Pindi Chana was okay. I think Trader's Joe's version is better though.<br /><br />I have yet to try the Rajma and Palak Paneer, which have gotten among the highest reviews on amazon, so that's why I err with a 2 star rating instead of just 1 star.

review/summary: NO CURRY !!!  And you pay for packaging...
review/text: NO CURRY.  These products contain "Red Chili Powder".  And too much of it.<br /><br />In addition, each package has over 30% sodium!<br /><br />Each package arrives with a free CD promoting their mission.  We now have 6 CD's of the same music!!<br /><br />The portions are NOT as photographed. Maybe for two people, maybe.  The "Spinach with Cottage Cheese" has 4 cubes among a small portion of spinach sauce.  Not even worth the time to heat.<br /><br />The flavor is good, with the above exceptions. And the ingredients tasted fresh.  The packaging is prepared for NASA...(sealed in a silver pouch) so it makes one wonder how fresh indeed it is. And made us lose our appetite.<br /><br />If you purchase this, you pay for the packaging. And a free CD.

review/text: I've tried these before individually, but this was the first opportunity I had to get them together.  First, the food is relatively good quality for this kind of product, but I would say that it's more oily than what you'd find in a restaurant (and definitely moreso than homecooked) and of course significantly higher in sodium.  The taste, however, is reasonably good.  Second, the price that I paid for these was very good (I ended up getting a 20% discount), and so from a value perspective I would say decently good food + good price = very good value.

review/summary: didnt sit well with mongo
review/text: Greetings fellow amazonians I just love indian food! I have always said that if I had to go vegetarian I would move to india for all the great flavors that the put into their food. Being on the road so much has limited my availabity to great indian restaurant and when I saw this on amazon I thought wow I must have these. Well the shipment came quickly (as always) and I was excited to share these great flavors with my trailermates, mongo and eugene. Mongo was in (he always is when it invloves food), but eugene was going off to a local comic book show because he wanted to get an autograph from one of the original borgs from some star trek show. Anyhoo I decided to make mongo the pav bhaji and myself the palak paneer. I loved my and mongo had eatten his before I even sat down. He screamed "more! more!" And started to beat his head on the table so to stop him I quickly put together the pindi chana and he scarfed that down too. As I was cleaning up mongo started to hold his stomach and make gurgling sounds. He wheeled himself into the bathroom and for the next two hours I only heard what sounded like his intestines giveing up what ever that had stored in there. I actually left because my trailer started to smell too bad. While outside I realized that mongo had irritable bowel syndrome and the indian food must have. fired that up. Wow let me tell you I made sure to wait until eugene showed up to clean up the mess that mongo made before I reappeared. At least I had some good paneer tonight

review/summary: Just what the doctor ordered.
review/text: It is a fact that I am a dehydrating fan. My vegetable garden products are not only eaten fresh but I conserve them by canning and dehydrating on a regular basis. I was a bit hesitant to try food that someone else had dried until a friend introduced me to Harmony House dried foods. She is an avid backpacker and hiker and practically lives off dried food on her rambles. Once I had tried the dried tomato dices I was sold. This product is wonderful and has a rich very satisfying tomato taste without the aftertaste that some products have. It is pure nature in all its splendor. Since then I have added a number of Harmony House dried foods to my emergency stash and use them on a regular basis in soups, stews, breads, dips, etc. Take my word for it, you won't go wrong with this product. It makes you smile!

review/text: I like to add dried tomato bits to soups and stews and sauces, but I hate throwing away unused and rotten tomatoes. Solution: dried tomatoes. And these are good quality. They are just about the right size: too small and there would be little texture and too big and they probably wouldn't rehydrate well and would be chewy. These are just right and very convenient.

review/text: I just placed another order with Harmony House, and the tomato dices were in it. I throw these tomato pieces into everything I can for more flavor and nutrition. The pieces are small and rehydrate quickly, so it doesn't add extra cook time if you're just adding a little extra to your existing recipes.<br /><br />The shipping cost is a little steep for ordering a single item since it is a USPS flat rate, so it's worth looking at the rest of the company site and adding more items to your order.

review/text: I was a little disappointed in this product.  I do buy more and more dehydrated vegetables, finding them more flavorful than canned or freeze dried.  These tomatoes disappointed me.  If you cook them too long they lose their flavor.  But I have used sun dried tomatoes, several different brands, and I guess I expected their intense flavor. I plan to stick with sun dried from now on.

review/summary: Quaker Oats Quick Minute
review/text: This product is great for the price. My MAJOR complaint is that the packaging is really not up to par. The container is made of a flimsy cardboard with a paper like bottom. The container sides are actually "tucked" up under the bottom and not glued or secured in anyway, so what do you think happens? All of the bottoms collasp. I ordered this product without reading the reviews and I have just noticed that someone else reported having the same issue. I really do not like products that can be easily tampered with. And aside from that, the warehouse that they keep the items in more than likely has rodents and the last thing I want to think about is some rodent slithering its way into the bottom of the box or nibbling on the spillage outside of the container.<br /><br />If this is how Quaker Oats packages them, than you would be better off finding them in your local market where you can at least inspect the bottom before purchasing. Imagine getting a shipment with four 42 oz boxes of oats spilling out of the containers; not great.

review/text: This is the best commercially available beef jerky around. It's drier than most products out there (Pemican, Jack Daniels) and much more authentic. Sadly, it seems that Trader Joe's has stopped carying it and started using their own, inferior brand. Honestly, it'g going to reduce the number of trips I make to trader joe's by 1/2. Anyway, if you like authentic beef jerkey (like the kind you used to find in the glass jars at gas stations) this is the only brand for you!

review/summary: Great Jerky
review/text: I can't claim that this is the best tasting Jerky for anyone since everyone has their own opinion/tastes, but I am not afraid to admit that I buy beef Jerky anytime I see it within reach.<br /><br />Been a huge fan of beef jerky since I was a little kid since I was on plenty of road trips from New Mexico to Colorado because of family.  Jerky was the perfect snack.  From 20 years ago to now, I always have had a passion for Jerky and never surprised by any Jerky until this came around.<br /><br />Was only able to find this Jerky in my company's cafeteria.  Then they stopped carrying it and immediately looked online to find it.  Yes it might be expensive, but its totaly worth it.  Even their customer service is great because one time I got a bad package from the cafeteria and reported it on their site.  They ended up sending me 4 fresh packages (all different flavors) to make up for it.<br /><br />This is worth a try if you want something new.  Unfortunately I can't afford to get this all the time.  Maybe its a good thing because I ordered 2 orders of the Jerky (24 packages) and went through it in 3 days.

review/text: I first tried this in CA. It was carried for a while in VA but was no longer carried a few years ago. I hope it continues to sell since it is by far the best beef jerky. It is high quality meat (not too soft, not to fatty) and has a nice flavor.

review/summary: The best beef jerky ever.
review/text: I discovered Snackmasters Beef Jerky almost 10 years ago at BJ's.  They stopped carrying it several years ago and now only stock Slim Jim and Pemmican.  I couldn't find Snackmasters anywhere and tried every other brand of jerky I could find - Jack Link's, Trader Joe's, anything I found.  Nothing compared.  Finally, for Christmas 2008, my wife got me a couple bags of Snackmasters straight from the company and I have to say, it's still the best.  It tastes like what I imagine jerky is supposed to taste like - seasoned, dried beef.  Everything else is soft and greasy; Snackmasters requires a lot of chewing and the flavor is perfect.  I'm glad Amazon is carrying it now.

review/summary: best beef jerky i've ever had
review/text: We bought the 2.5 oz "original" recipe package for $3.29 at Traders Joe's, and were pleasantly surprised how great tasting this beef jerky was - it's neither too dry nor too soft, it's just right texture. The spices used are very tasty and well balanced, and the outcome is a great tasting "gourmet" product, just like the label says. Lastly, no preservatives is used. Kids would love this product because of the texture and the taste.  This is a great food find and I'm buying more at Amazon to share.

review/summary: Expensive but unique food
review/text: Basically, the taste of this cereal is remarkably like Grape Nuts (which I have and still do like also). The difference is there's no risk of an emergency dental call with the Ezekiel cereal, which is not nearly as hard as Grape Nuts. Ezekiel will also satisfy those who mandate organic ingredients, etc.<br /><br />Sprouted grain products are truly tasty and deserve to be more familiar to more people. They put refined grains (i. e., white flour) to shame nutritionally and unsprouted whole grains (i. e., whole wheat) to shame in terms of taste/texture. It's more expensive, but buy a box to sample first and then buy bulk afterwards, as I have.

review/text: Amaranth cereal has a very positive effect on me. One bowl of delicious amaranth a day, with rice milk and sliced banana - that's my recipe for good health and (regular) digestion. Amaranth flakes are delicious, too. The nuggets (discontinued many years ago) were even tastier. If you're looking for something good to eat, something that's not going to upset your stomach, something that you're going to look forward to eating every day, give amaranth products a try. You'll soon discover why it's called "the mystical grain of the Aztecs."

review/text: This is an aggravating cereal to love.  The flakes have a great flavor, do not get soggy in milk and the stuff is nutritious.  We eat it every day.<br /><br />The aggravating part is that only 'health food' stores in Chicago carry it though the manufacturer swears we can get it in the two major chains here - Dominick's (Safeway) and Jewel (Albertson's).  Neither grocery ever has it on their shelves, however.  The truly aggravating part is that after two years of reliable availability from Amazon it disappeared from the website!  The 16 oz. box size has re-appeared and can be ordered through Amazon from another vendor (at twice the price).  I am thrilled beyond words that the 12.5 oz. size has become available directly from Amazon.  Hopefully it remain indefinitely.

review/summary: Only cereal that stays crunchy.
review/text: One of the main reasons I like this cereal is that it stays crunchy even after pouring on milk.  Most cereals immediately turn to mush but this one stays crispy long enough to finish the bowl if you pour in the milk just before eating it.  The manufacturer changed the formula for this product earlier this year (2012) and I took off one star because the new formula is not as tasty as before.  Still better than anything else I've tried though. Being able to buy it on Amazon with free shipping makes it less expensive than buying locally IF you can even find it!

review/text: My family has long loved this cereal but had to search for it constantly. The few places that sold it were always out. By chance I looked on line and was pleased to find it.  After happily receiving it a couple months the next batch came in "new and improved"!  Bummer!!! We loved the old and just right!  Almost cancelled but the new grew on us.  The flakes are harder than the old ones which we don't like and although it says less sugar it seems sweeter which it didn't need.  Prefer the former product but it is still one of our favorites and we will continue to buy it.

The 2 oz."California Pantry" gourmet water crackers were edible with the Wisconsin cheese but had a lot of trans-fat and were made in Hong Kong. The 4 oz. "Focaccia Crisps Tuscan Style Crackers" were ho-hum, slightly not-crisp crackers, made with palm oil in Indonesia. A 2oz. slice of "Italian Rasperry Cake" was dry. The most weight in the basket came from the 3.75 oz. pack of cheese, the 5 oz beef salami and a small jar of mustard. All 3 were ok, but at what price?

For all the goodies found inside, I can purchase all of them at a supermarket for less than $10, and better quality ones too! The most ridiculous is the "White Chocolate Amaretto" wafer cookie, which sure enough contain only one 2 1/2" thin wafer cookie! Then the Cajun Mustard is of size where the restaurant would just give it to you when you order a sandwich. The "Sweet Butter Cookies" packed in Indonesia is of unknown origin and contains ten one-inch size of very ordinary Danish butter cookies. The "Double Chocolate Raspberry Cake" comes in a big flat box, but the cake is only a quarter of the box size, and no bigger than a regular piece of brownie. Other items also come in such small quantity that will amaze you! Something does come in sizable quantity: paper stuffing! The only good that comes out of this gift is the heartfelt thoughtfulness of the sender. Anything more than 1 star given is so that the sender will not feel that their money is being ripped off!

review/text: The Art of Appreciation Grand Edition was a FLOP!  I sent it to my brother for Christmas.  He told me it looked wonderful but there was VERY little there to eat! His wife ate the ONE cookie, they each got ONE truffle.  It was all pretty package and no goodies.  I feel so badly I am going to send them a restraurant gift card!

Being able to select a basket of goodies via Amazon was a wonderful answer to my problem. It was delivered ahead of time and all the family found something to enjoy in it. I was described as Mrs Anonymous as I hadn't worked out how to include a gift card. My friends were perplexed but it all added to their enjoyment.

review/summary: 65th Wedding Anniversary Gift.
review/text: We were so excited when receiving this gift, it was very pretty, However, once into the basket it was terribly disappointing. Very little of anything, mostly crackers, and nothing was even tasty. I definatley didn't tell my daughter how disappointing the basket was, didn't want to hurt her feelings, I thought the salmon would be tasty, however, it had absolutley no taste to it. very bland. It was full of I will say, empty boxes, and definately was not worth the money, I would be afraid to order anything from this company, and I think you should know Amazon.<br />The biggest joke of all was the delightful raspberry cake,  what a joke. I'm still laughing at this one.

review/text: I was very disappointed that my Easter message was never included in the basket when it was delivered so my daughter had absolutely no idea who sent it.  Also, the chocolate raspberry cake was just a bunch of crumbles when they opened it which means it was probably stale instead of holding together as it should.  I will not use this product again.

review/summary: It's Just OK...
review/text: ... IF this were not at a reduced price and was eligible for free shipping, I wouldn't have even tried it. I liked that it didn't have MSG and didn't use pork as seasoning. My family is adding more vegetables to our diet as we are "eating better to live better". There was an unnatural sweet taste such that I was expecting to find Sweet Potatoes somewhere, a very unsettling feeling for me. Didn't know if this batch was inadvertantly prepared with their Sweet Potatoe product. We don't like products with hidden sugar.* (*As the commenter noted sugar IS listed in the ingredients. I should have said "unexpected sweet taste". Truthfully I was expecting similar seasoning as in Sylvia's Collard greens.)<br /><br />I've never been to Sylvia's Restaurants so I don't really know if this is how it's supposed to taste. I won't order this again.

review/summary: Yummy Weight Loss?
review/text: OK - So I admit, I bought this for the possibility to lose weight with zero effort. I am not overweight at all but have ZERO muscle and a few curves I am not proud of. Anyway, my hopes were low but I figured I would have a healthy caffeinated tea in the long-run. So I have been drinking it for 2-3 weeks now and I don't think the scale is lying but I have lost about 5 lbs. Now, I understand that many factors could have caused this but I am pretty sure my eating habits have stayed the same. I still don't drink coffee or soda and I definitely don't exercise. I have not been drinking as much alcohol as I was during Football season so I know that might be a factor.<br /><br />Bottom line is that I know anything could have caused the weight loss but the only thing that I have done drastically different is drink 1-2 cups of this tea per day. It tastes great (hot not cold or warm), gives me a healthy pep and focus, and I have not seen the scale consistently this low in a couple of years. Not to mention is comes nicely packaged. You can't go wrong here and I highly recommend it.

review/text: One review said this tea tasted like dirt which, in all respect, tastes more like grass that has been in dirt.  As funny as that review was, Oolong tea is an acquired taste much like coffee or other teas.  Once you've acquired the taste, it's actually one of the better oolong teas I've tasted and probably one of the most genuine.  You get 100 bags for under $10; you can't beat that.

review/text: You can find this tea for just over $5.00 in many Asian food markets.  It is well worth the cost.  This is a great tasting tea.  I have had some oolong/wulong teas that tasted like steeped twigs.  This is not one of them.  If you steep this tea for less than 3 minutes, you can still get a good tasting cup of tea from a second brewing with the same tea bag.  If you don't microwave (or boil) your tea water with the tea bag in it, you can even get a pretty decent third cup of tea!  You'll find that when you are brewing a pot of tea for yourself & friends, you will only need 1 or 2 bags to make a whole pot!

I'm glad I found it at Amazon. The price is close to what I paid at the store.<br /><br />I have tried many different oolongs from an online tea company. This tea is characteristic of the biscuity quality found in many oolongs. It isn't astringent. Sweetener is not needed. It is a very good tea for every day.

These are sold at reasonable prices.

review/text: I'm not a huge tea drinker (coffee every day) but I do enjoy black tea, Earl Grey, and Chai tea. This tea is nice addition. I bought it because I'd heard good things about it including Dr. Oz recommending it. At that point it was a question of which of the many oolongs on Amazon do I buy. I bought three. They are all very similar in flavor, require a touch of sweetener for my tastes but are very good. They are all a bit subdued in flavor with this one being the lightest. I've never had oolong tea in a restaurant so I can't compare to that but I didn't find it to taste like dirt.

However, of the 40 tea bags I've used, 4 have not been completely sealed along the side of the tea bag, causing tea to spill everywhere when I open the package or to leak pieces of tea leaves into my cup. With the price and taste, the tea's certainly still worth it, but you may need to be careful when you open the individual tea bags!

It's just an interesting flavor.<br />I have steeped it several different ways (sometimes with another flavor of tea) for variety.<br />Like I said, now that I'm 'used' to it, it's actually pretty good. But my senses always take me directly to DIRT when I take that first sip.<br /><br />Enjoy! :)

review/summary: Best oolong tea ever
review/text: I love this tea, it is awesome. I actually was sick and the only tea I had in my house was green and oolong tea. I decided to take the oolong tea and I was shocked that I was feeling better internally and externally, my clothes was fitting me differently. My appetite was curbed alot. I hardly was hungry. I honestly drink 4-6 cups of this tea a day and still drinking it till this day. I haven't hopped on the scale yet I am going to wait until next month to see how much weight I have lost. Since my cold is over with I will start back going to my Zumba classes this week and I am pretty sure the results will be more outstanding. And of course eating clean that is the most important factor when losing weight. So I decided to have 2 cups of oolong tea before each meal. I will have oolong tea in my diet forever. It is a must especially if you want to lose weight and don't forget the fabulous health factors also.

review/text: I love Oolong tea, and have had the pleasure of drinking a great quality loose leaf Velvet Oolong.  I was a bit apprehensive about ordering Oolong tea bags for that reason.  The pricing on this product was too good to pass up, so I thought I would give it a try.  It is not bad at all.  The aroma is not as rich as a good loose leaf tea, but this tea is very flavorful.  Quite delicious actually.<br /><br />One tea bag provided several cups of good rich tea.<br /><br />I am very happy with my order, and I would highly recommend if you are looking for an Oolong bagged tea.<br /><br />Thank You!
