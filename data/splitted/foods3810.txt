review/summary: Love Wellness for all of my dogs
review/text: I have 5 dogs that are mine since I consider them too high maintenance to be adopted out. I have spent the last year and a half rescuing dogs from high kill shelters and after vaccinating, spaying, neutering, caring for many different needs, have found homes for 352 dogs. Many have fostered at my home. All dogs have thrived on Wellness original formula. My largest, oldest dog is 14 and weighs 140 pounds and is doing great, though before I found Wellness, the lab/chesapeake was showing symptoms of hip dysplasia. He actually has lost 20 pounds and doing well.

review/summary: High quality, but be cautious with picky eaters
review/text: One of my dogs has always been picky with dry food, and this one here is not his favorite. He gives me the saddest look when I put this down in front of him, and it takes him forever to eat it. I do wish the bits were slightly smaller since he's missing a big chomper (and I imagine lots of older dogs have sensitive and/or missing teeth). It's the same size as other Wellness dry foods, from what I have observed: triangle shaped...small, but sort of thick pieces. He tends to prefer thin kibble.<br /><br />I know this is a high quality food because I've done my research, and my other two dogs love the taste (they love anything) but I would start out with a small bag and see how it goes before buying a large bag. Start out gradually, mixing it in with their old food, so they have a chance to adjust.<br /><br />Also note this stuff has a distinct smell compared to most other dry foods; it's not bad, just unique. It's like a spice of some sort. Maybe that's why my picky eater doesn't like it. I do know that Wellness Healthy Weight is much more mild smelling.

review/summary: High quality food that helped my dog lose weight
review/text: I switched to this food about two months ago and it's a perfect fit for my dog. He has a sensitive digestive system and I was looking for a corn- and wheat-free food. He also has joint issues (ACL surgery 6 months ago), and he's 13 years old. After two months eating this food, he has shed his excess weight almost effortlessly (although we've cut down on the treats a bit too). He loves the flavor and I've noticed that he has more energy. His coat is silky soft. I feel good feeding him this high quality food and hope that it will extend his life... forever.

review/summary: The Best Dog Food For Seniors Look No Further
review/text: My 13 year old Rescued Belgian Shepherd Groenendael has passed on after a short 6 year stay with me! I was a newbie to pet care when Samantha (Sammie) came into my life, initially I feed her one of the advertised dog foods (I---). The females shed twice a year, in my case it was 12 months a year, it was awful to the point of me almost going insane. I loved and hated my beautiful dog! I researched the internet and asked anyone I could if there was a solution to Sammie's problem. I even tried other brands which she wouldn't eat, this became costly.<br />Finally a Petco representative turned me on to Wellness Senior blend. It is as special blend minus fillers , etc., it had vitamins, plus G. Condrodin (sp) for her hip problems.<br />I gradually adjusted her diet over a period of a couple weeks Wellness is a very rich dog food, dogs need to adjust to the new food. She loved the taste, after a short period of time her shedding almost came to a stop along with her dandruff.  After her passing I found out Groenendaels need to be brushed daily or at least several times a week, if you do this regularly they do not need bathing. That is what the experts say. The breed is really Very Special, a great family dog check them out.<br />There is no way you can go wrong with Wellness dog foods, be sure to go to their web site to check out their science, be sure to read the customer testimonials. You will be happy you did!!!!

review/summary: Best dog food ever
review/text: We have a lab mix, now 12 years old and doing amazingly well on Wellness Senior. We had a scary experience with another "natural" dog food. After using it for over a year this other brand suddenly made our dog very ill. We did not figure it out right away as he is a lab and will eat ANYTHING. Usually once or twice a year he gets into something that make him ill for a few days. Last time, we did our usual routine of rice and chicken stock. He got better, put him back on the other food, and he got worse again. After another cycle like that, we realized it must be the other food. So we went down tot he local pet shop looking for something better. They recommended Wellness and we have never looked back. After only a week or so on Wellness, Bear's coat got was noticeably more lustrous. Now, almost two years later we still are amazed by this food. I love the fact that it does not even smell like "dog food". The ingredients list is totally free of the usual gunk that is in most food. Yeah it is a bit more expensive, but totally worth it. Even his stool does not smell!

review/summary: Switch from Science Diet
review/text: Wellness had been recommended by several pet owners, primarily because of the use of more natural ingredients versus more processed ingredients in Science Diet.  My dog has made the transition from Science Diet to Wellness without any problems.  Still too early to tell if this will have a positive impact on her health, but I could probably say that about the Science Diet even after all the years I have used it.  I started buying Wellness through Amazon after my local pet chain store stopped carrying the Wellness we use in the larger size.

review/summary: My pug loves this food...
review/text: My pug comes running when he see's me filling up his bowl with this stuff. I really like it because since I started him on Wellness Supermix senior , his shedding has almost stopped , he is getting around much better (he's 13) and his is as slim and trim as he was as a teenager. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the Wellness has no oils in it to keep his skin moist. So if you buy this , be sure to add a few drops of Omega 3 oil to it or your dog may be scratching more from dry skin. It is a very healthy food for your dog. I plan on feeding any dog I ever get in the future this stuff.

review/summary: Colours Please!
review/text: I usually love just hard candy any day of the week, but for Halloween I'd love to have some chocolate in my life, something I don't eat often. But I picked these up at a local Walgreens and I'm happy I did. I only did so because I saw there was white chocolate kit kats and I love the white chocolate over regular chocolate. I will say this I dunno about that other person but the orange ones basically taste like white chocolate--OH WAIT that because IT IS WHITE CHOCOLATE. Of course it tastes different!! It has more of sweeter taste than oppose to chocolate which is more bitter. If anything they were tasting the food coloring and yes sometimes it can be heavy and make things taste like perfume. BTW I'm 24yo grown woman and I see nothing wrong in passing this out to kids, if they don't like it they'll throw it away so it really doesn't make a difference.<br /><br />And that applies to any Halloween candy if it's gross it'll get thrown away but some stray cat or dog will have at it lol.<br /><br />But either way they tasted good to me and if I find them next year (or more this year) I'mma sure buy em. Right now I'm interested in the Japanese Kit Kats :)

review/summary: average-ish white tea - nothing bad but nothing special either
review/text: I probably need to try other brands/types of white tea to compare,<br />but overall I've had green teas I consider to be much better relatively speaking<br />I've had green teas that I rate to be about as mediocre as this seems to be compared to better green teas<br /><br />I like the smell of this freshly brewed, and the taste at first but after a bit the taste seems to go sort of "flat" or something.<br />I also make batches of this and put it in the refrigerator as iced tea<br />it's the same, at first the smell and taste are pretty good, but it quickly loses the appealing aroma and the taste goes from better than decent to a little less than decent<br />I usually end up having to add sugar or lots of ice or watering it down or just drinking it fairly to drink more than a small cup of it at a time<br /><br />I still drink it because I haven't felt like trying other white teas yet<br /><br />overall it's drinkable, it's not horrible, but it's also not any special<br /><br />If I find other white teas that are better I'll drop the rating to a 2 but for now it seems like it's worth a star 3 rating

review/text: I started my dogs on these Dentastix and they really made a difference in their teeth, plus they loved them.  Then our local Walmart stopped carrying them.  I found them on Amazon for the same price as Walmart, plus no tax or shipping.  Having to buy in bulk was no problem since two dogs get one each daily so I figured it would be about six to eight weeks worth.  I have been very pleased with Dentastix.  As usual, Amazon.com came through.

review/text: I wanted to respond to the review by the person whose vet said they're 300 calories. The Dentastix for small dogs have 49 calories, and the regular size have 70. I'm not sure about the large.<br /><br />I use these for my dog on a daily basis, and he loves them! I feed him twice daily with a mix of wet and dry dog food according to feeding instructions, probably 3-4 GoodBites Multi-Vitamin treats a day after walks, and a Dentastix at the end of the day. My dog is not obese, he weighs 8.1 lbs, exactly what a Yorkshire Terrier should be (8lbs is ideal for the breed).<br /><br />After seeing that other review, I was in disbelief and did some research.

review/summary: Something is not right with these.
review/text: I bought this from Walmart (much cheaper there!) I bought the small dog dentastix and gave one to my 10 pound dog and one to the 5 pound dog. They loved them. The next day my little 5 pounder was very bloated in the morning. I freaked out because I've never felt that kind of bulge in her before. I took her to the vet and the bloating was gone by then. But after I returned home she had two more episodes like that that day. She was scared herself and extremely clingy that day and the next two days. The bloating happen once the next day but it was much less severe. I wasn't positive at the time if it was the dentastix but a few days later we did give her 1/4 of a stix and then I new it was that. The next day was bloating again but it was not bad I guess because she had a smaller piece. I also read later that the bag says it's not suitable for under 5 lbs. If it can make her that sick, I will assume it's probably doing something internally to my bigger pooch but just not showing physical symptoms. I would never buy this again.

review/summary: So so overpriced
review/text: Anyone who would purchase this product from Amazon for the stated price  of $40.43 for 100 stix of 55.7 oz. must have money to burn and probably does not do price comparisons.  I purchase this item at Kroger's.  I pay $6.69 regular price (or $4.99 sale price, which happens often) less the value of any coupons I find on-line or in the Sunday newspaper for a bag of 25 stix (14.1 oz) which comes to a total of $26.76 for four bags of 25.  If I purchase the product here I would be paying the equivalent of $8.19 (which includes my 20% Prime discount) for the same size bag.  And if I read the Amazon blurb correctly this price of $40.43 less 20% is a one-time deal.<br /><br />BTW I think the product is wonderful and deserves 5 stars on that account.  My beagle Bootsie loves them.  And what is more wonderful, no more doggie breath.

review/summary: If you want an obese dog.....
review/text: Just an FYI for the doglovers out there.....per my Vet, each of these chew-sticks has 300 calories each.  That is probably why she called my dogs "obese" on their last check-up.  You'd never know that because nutritional info is not put on the bags like human food....there are much lower-calorie chew sticks out there and they do put their calorie count on the bag (the new ones I buy are 19 calories each....BIG DIFFERENCE)<br /><br />The boys have lost 3 pound each since we dropped the Dentastix a day habit!

review/summary: my favorite jerky as a meal helper
review/text: i'm surprised to see so many negative reviews. considering this is my favorite jerky i feel obligated to write an review. it is tender, flavorful, and relatively healthy (no artificial ingredients, no preservatives like sodium benzoate except naturally occurring one in soy sauce), and the hint of sweetness is just right. the beef variety sometimes is too hard and dry to my liking. the turkey one is much better.<br /><br />it is probably too salty as a snack but it is excellent as a meal helper and blends well into different kinds of meals. (well it is not that salty considering all the fast food we are exposed to. it contains 470mg (20% daily value) of sodium per serving (1oz/28g) and has 8 servings per bag. so even if you somehow eat the whole bag at once it is just 160% daily value of sodium.)

review/text: I enjoy jerky and like to try new kinds and new brands. Last week at the nearby Costco, I found 16-ounce packets of Pacific Gold Teriyaki Turkey Jerky, subdivided into two 8-ounce pouches. It's good! It's tender, but chewy. It has a nice flavor, but it's a little too sweet to be ideal for me. It has a very low fat and cholesterol, but is perhaps a little high on salt. The jerky seemed good and fresh, if you can apply that word to jerky. This stuff is pretty good. I don't think it's going to last long.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I'be purchased Starbucks pods for a year and a half, by multiple case lots, and have enjoyed them until recently. After an inexcusably lengthy backorder period the pods I have received on two shipments since then have been poorly formed and seem to tightly packed based on increased flow times (40-50 seconds) to pull a shot from my Breville espresso maker (I'm talking about 12-16 boxes, not just a single bad box). Is my pump going bad? That may be a possibility but during the backorder period I ordered LaVazza pods and they needed tamping because they pulled too quickly. I've also found now that I was forced to try something other than Starbucks I like the tast of the LaVazza (and possibly others) better.

review/summary: StarBucks Shot in the AM!
review/text: As a frequent Traveler to the West Coast, I have found myself in accommodations where there just wasn't a nearby StarBucks location, and I don't have the taste for regular coffee, since there is just too much Inconsistency and reliability of both coffeemakers and coffee/espresso grinds.<br />Plus, I have been Spoiled Rotten by my purchase of the Bosch Tassimo Coffee/espresso maker earlier this year, that currently, I am still working thru my StarBuck's enormous inventory and supply of their espresso's, and then, it's not like I can just take my Tassimo with me on my trips either!<br />I purchased the Hand-powered espresso machine, called the HandPresso Wild - Black model, mainly because it uses the StarBucks Espresso Pods.<br />I will be writing a separate review on the "HandPresso" unit, which I have learn to love!<br /><br />In short, here's the main highlights for the 'StarBucks Espresso Pods' - I Highly Recommend them!<br /><br />* Starbucks Espresso Roast Pods, are each in their own Foil-sealed package, EZ to tear open, with 12-pods in each box, has a dense, caramel-like sweetness and smooth, satisfying finish. I usually take 2 boxes on my 2 to 3 -week trips, and always have some left over.<br /><br />* Price point of only $4.95 is Excellent! That's only 41 cents per shot, AND, it's Human-powered! How Cool is that!<br /><br />* Starbucks coffee pods, filled with fresh-roasted, ground and tamped Starbucks Espresso Roast, so there's no measuring, no grinding, no mess.<br /><br />* The coffee pods can be used with most home espresso machines (must accept E.S.E. - Easy Serving Espresso - pods.)<br /><br />* With a good `Routine', you can make an Expresso in 5-minutes or less!<br /><br />Here is my Recommended AM Espresso Routine:<br /><br />1. Be sure to clean the unit the night before, then leave my Favorite StarBucks Coffee Cup + the  `HandPresso' open in 2 parts + 1 or 2 Espresso Pod(s) + Creamer, and/or Sweetener, if applicable, out on the kitchen counter.<br />2. First thing in the AM, before shaving, I  place a 1 or 2-quart Tea Kettle with or without a Whistle is fine on the stove. Check out the Pedrini model listed here on Amazon, it's Simple and it Works!<br />Use about a quart of fresh or filtered water and bring to a Boil.<br />3. As soon as I return to the kitchen, I hand-pump the HandPresso to the maximum of 16 (top of Green bar), and once you get the hang of it, this only takes 1 to 2 minutes, and is Great Exercise, BTW!<br />TIP - the Handle IS the `hand-pump', and it only takes a Quarter Turn Counter-clockwise to "Unlock", and let the Pumping begin! When done, you may turn it Clock-wise to Re-lock it, but is not necessary.<br />4. I then open the Espresso Pod, place it nearby, AND, place my Powered or Liquid Creamer (&/or Sweetener), in the cup, and pour an ounce or two of Hot H2O, into it to "prep it".<br />5. Then, I pour the Hot, boiling water into the Glass Well opening, on the HandPresso, to at or near the top, I place the  Pod in it, then place the Lid, Pushing down slightly (look for the White line markings), then Turn it Clock-wise and Locking it in place. Important - Don't forget to Push & Place the Actuator Button, into the "On" position.<br />6. I Flip the HandPresso over and directly over my cup, and Press Down on the Button. Watch the Magic Happen! This only takes about 3 or 4 minutes, and at the end you will start to see BOTH the Pressure Needle move to the 0 position, AND there will also be some creamy froth and bubbling from the Pod.<br />7. Stir and Enjoy! Remember, once you have established your `ROUTINE Steps', the whole procedure becomes much Faster, especially when Traveling, Camping or on any Expeditions.<br /><br />Caveats - Use less H2O if you want a Stronger Shot, Use more Creamer to dilute it, thus giving you a fuller cup of coffee/espresso. If you are just going to use a Sweetener, and NO Creamer, I highly using the Organic, Low Glycemic Sweetener, made from Blue Agave Nectar, by Wholesome Sweeteners.

I took a chance and with the first order the pods were great and so I felt much more comfortable to reorder.  Unfortunately the second order was awful.  The taste was bitter and left a burning sensation in my mouth  I will not order this product again.  I dont know if Starbucks was trying to get rid of defective product by selling through Amazon, but it not only put a bad taste in my mouth from the horrible coffee these pods produced it also shows a serious lack of quality control by Starbucks and the product that bears its name and Amazon that sold this offensive product..

review/summary: Low Quality Coffee
review/text: Let's face it, it's hard to find good coffee in the States. Your average coffee is little more than dirt water and all Starbucks did was bringing to the mainstream a little better coffee that why Americans who visit Italy and try an espresso in any bar cannot go back to Starbucks. Just today a friend returning from a week in Rome asked me to help him buy an espresso machine. The problem as always is not finding a good machine (plenty choice) but finding a good coffee. I grew up in Italy and when it comes to coffee I don't compromise. I actually get my coffee from Italy. I'm a bit of a coffee connoisseur (check my review of the De Longhi machine as wel), I do know Starbucks coffee well and I don't like it because it's your typical high volume quality. Sometimes away from home I'll go for it because it's either that or a cup of what I call "dish-washing water." Starbucks roasts a high volume of coffee at high temperature to keep up with their demand. If you want a good espresso you have to roast the grains at low temperature for a long time, that's not fast enough for Starbucks and that's why their coffee tastes bitter and burned. I give a generous three stars because the pods make life easier and keep the place cleaner regardless of it being quite expensive; but on Amazon you can get 150 pods of Lavazza coffee for less than $50 and that's a much better coffee even if Lavazza is the high volume of Italian coffee.

review/text: I was kind of disappointed in this product. I was looking for something that would help me make espresso faster in the morning. This actually makes it take longer. Usually I grind up beans and tamp them down and sometimes it takes awhile to get the correct type of grounds. Then I just warm up the machine and it makes dark beautiful espresso.<br /><br />With these pods, the water has to go through the pods several times before I get a dark enough espresso. I'm sorry, but I don't have the time of day to keep running hot water through my machine and into the espresso glasses, waiting for the perfect espresso.<br /><br />Other than that, it's an easy cleanup.

It is a very oily instead of dry bean so you may want to just keep a small amount out in an airtight container and freeze the rest. I only purchased one bag to try since I had been disappointed in kirkland's/starbuck's organic gold bag coffee. Now I must hurry back and purchase more before all is sold as it was a limited buy item. I am glad Amazon carries this brand, although it is the non-organic version. I assure you this will be one of the best coffees you will try.Enjoy!

It would be an exact replica of coconut water if they just removed the salt.<br /><br />I guess it is because people use this to replace electrolytes, so unless you are training hard, you might not like it.

review/text: HOW can you say it's natural if you add salt and sugar to it? Aside from that, it does taste pretty close to real young thai coconut water, and the ease of mixing cannot be beat! I bought a box of these yesterday for a plane trip I'm off on tomorrow. I'll be spending a week traveling and I'm unsure of the availability of coconut water on my trip. The box arrived in less than 24 hours.

review/summary: A Rich and Robust Alternative to Coffee
review/text: Three years ago I gave up most caffeine in my diet but I've never been able to give up that last little bit contained in a good cup of decaffeinated coffee -- until now.  While the flavor is a little different than that of coffee, its close enough to become my new morning ritual.  Here's what I like about this healthy alternative:<br /><br />  * I brew it in a coffee pot just like usual<br /><br />  * The drink's consistency is similar to coffee and is dark roasted color<br /><br />  * It comes in various flavors just like coffee<br /><br />  * I drink it with about half the raw sugar and cream I used to use<br /><br />  * I'm totally satisfied with my drink; I don't feel cheated<br /><br />In addition to cutting on caffeine, I'm also cutting costs.  When I make coffee I use a tablespoon of coffee per cup.  With this stuff I use only a half-tablespoon.

review/text: If you're searching for a coffee replacement, something that fools you into thinking you're drinking coffee, this probably isn't it, but if you're looking for a great tasting, healthy alternative to coffee, I don't believe you can do any better.  As I'm typing this, I'm drinking a huge glass of 2 cups brewed Teeccino added to 1 cup light soy milk and a packet of Stevia with ice.  I have it once a day and look forward to it, knowing I'm actually adding something healthy to my body, and there are no sugar or caffeine jitters. I've been buying Teeccino for about 15 years, first at the health food stores and then on Amazon.com where I always get it for the best price. (Love free shipping!!)

review/summary: Healthy Substitute For Coffee
review/text: The following review is the review I wrote on the vanilla flavored Teeccino. I saw no reason to change it except to mention that I found the Mocha flavor to be even better. It's not nearly as chocolaty or sweet as hot chocolate (thankfully) and it has only 20 calories per cup. It tastes more like coffee then the vanilla and mint and is the flavor smoother. My wife didn't care for the other two but loves the Mocha. It makes for a great, healthy after-dinner desert drink.<br /><br />*<br /><br />This is my second time trying Teeccino and I must say the more I drink it the better I like it. As I've gotten older, coffee is having adverse effects my digestive track and it's not been good so I need something else and tea just doesn't cut it. Teeccino seems to be about as close to coffee as one can get without being coffee. The mint was really good and this vanilla nut may even be better. Teeccino doesn't leave that bad aftertaste coffee gives you (even the really good stuff) and it seems to give a slight energy boost. Nothing like coffee though. No brain stimulation. I think the energy comes from the inulin. I did some research on inulin and I suggest you do the same. I'm still not sure if it's a good thing or not. Some say yes and others no. It doesn't seem to have a negative effect on me as of yet. If you need to get off of coffee or hot chocolate or your just tired of drinking tea give Teeccino a try. I think you'll be quite pleased. Oh yea... I put honey and milk in mine and it's really good that way.<br /><br />I've been making a pitcher at the beginning of the week and keeping it in the fridge. It seems to keep very well. It's easier to heat up a cup on the stove in the morning so I don't wake the entire house with the noise of the coffee maker or microwave.

review/text: For those of us that can no longer drink coffee for health reasons, this may be the answer. As another reviewer suggested, I first tried a sample packet of all the Teeccino herbal coffees and this was the one I liked most. None taste like my wonderful coffee but for me this was a pleasant hot drink. If you try the samples, I suggest you try them at different concentrations. My preference is a more diluted drink that the standard recommended. After using it a couple of months I find I enjoy this hot drink almost as much as I did my morning Coffee. It brews the same as coffee and my be used with creamer and sugar. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it still isn't coffee.

review/summary: Great sub for coffee
review/text: I've always enjoyed a cup of black, mild-roast coffee in the morning, but found that my breastfed baby's reflux was much worse when I drank coffee- even the occasional treat. A friend had read about this product, suggested it, and I've not been disappointed! I find that if I use an equal amount of Teeccino as coffee, the taste is too strong to drink black. By cutting back the mix just a little, it's the perfect amount. I'm sure I'll go back to coffee at some point, but Teeccino has been a lifesaver for both baby and me during this period!

review/summary: it's delicious. don't think of it as coffee
review/text: I take my coffee "white" disguising it with sugar and skim milk.<br /><br />I chose this for a warm drink to drink after meals. I'm breastfeeding and my son doesn't respond well when I have had caffeine. Most decaffeinated coffees are made decaf using formaldehyde so that's a gross option.<br /><br />My favorite is the Hazelnut flavor, mildly nutty (don't expect starbuck hazelnut syrup). I don't like it black but I never drank real coffee straight either. I take mine with either skim milk or half/half.  Sometimes I use coconut flavored powder creamer. It's yummy.<br /><br />I will purchase it again (along with trying other flavors).<br /><br />For those of you disappointed in the taste, it's not coffee. It's better. Diet Coke isn't Coke, so why do you expect fake coffee to taste like real coffee?

review/summary: Delicious and no coffee withdrawal
review/text: I discovered Teeccino when I happened to see it on a huge discount at my local organic grocery. I normally wouldn't entertain the idea of a coffee substitute because I love a good fresh cup of coffee. However, I was pleasantly surprised! This stuff is robust and tasty and very satisfying. There are several flavors though so I started to experiment and found that I prefer the Mediterranean line of Teeccino, specifically "Mocha." So I switched from coffee to Mocha Teeccino and am living happily ever after. :) I now have my Teeccino automatically shipped to me so a package of three bags arrives on my doorstep just as I'm just about to run out. I get a reduced price this way and I'm basically cheap so that works for me.<br /><br />I have a suggestion, though... Like me, you may prefer one or two Teeccino flavors over others so do some taste testing so you can find out your favorite. I think there's a sample pack available so that should help. (Or maybe buy a few flavors and split with friends so you can all taste test). You should also know that the name Mocha may imply that it tastes like chocolate but that's not the case. This is not a chocolate-y drink (unless you add some of your own, which is always an option). I especially like the Mocha because it has a comforting and bold taste without being too bitter, too sweet, or too strong in any particular flavor.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot to mention that it makes a strong cup of brew in my press pot so I use a bit less than I would with coffee. That helps with the savings too.<br /><br />One caution... If you're thinking of trying the little Teeccino bags that remind you of making tea, I'd pass. You could maybe use two bags at a time but I've definitely found that the Teeccino that you buy in the bigger (11 oz.) bags has a much better flavor. Enjoy!

review/summary: Aweseom Alternative!
review/text: I woke up one morning and was diagnosed with a severe case of GERD (acid reflux disease). I had to give up everything.  Soda, caffeine, tea or alcohol... everything causes the lower esophagial sphincter to stay open, causing the worst cases of esophagitus and other complication.  So, out with the coffee... but decaf was still effecting my reflux.  I searched high and low for an alternative and just fell in love with Teeccino.  No caffeine, great taste, close enough to coffee to not miss the flavor and they have excellent blends for flavor.  Mocha has become one of my favorites, but so has Hazelnut and their new Almond Amaretto.  Try different ones. You won't be disappointed.  It took me 3 weeks to get over the headaches caused by withdrawl of caffeine, but I don't miss it now, in fact the weird thing is, I have more energy. Go figure.<br /><br />So for you refluxers out there, give this a shot!

review/summary: Am I the only one who doesn't think Teeccino's is a god send?
review/text: For a couple of years, I have been anxious to try out Teeccino. At one point, I didn't want to spend the money. At another, I didn't have a brewer nor wanted to buy one.<br /><br />When I started eating mostly raw foods, I decided to kick my coffee habit and pick up a Teeccino sample pack. I was thrilled when it arrived and I tried the Maya original first because it contained zero sugars. When I opened the packet, it was an earthy sort of smell, kind of like mulch or soil. It wasn't exactly appetizing. I brewed it and found the taste was NOTHING and I mean NOTHING like coffee. I tried again the next day and couldn't handle the taste of the Maya.<br /><br />So, I tried Mint Chocolate one day and Mocha the next of the Mediteranean blends. The mint chocolate tasted nothing like the reviews I had read - which suggested something similar to a thin mint cookie or a junior mint. I added some almond milk and stevia in order to make it taste a little better. It was tolerable, not awesome, but tolerable.<br /><br />I will say the mocha, thus far, has been my favorite. Is it delicious? Not by a long shot. It still has that soily taste to it and resembles coffee only in texture. It has an EXTREMELY mild, almost unnoticeable hint of chocolate - but it'll do for now.<br /><br />With additions, creamer, stevia, sweetener - whatever, Teeccino is indeed, very tolerable. I was highly disappointed after the rave reviews I had read, but it's still better than having no substitute in my opinion. I'm just curious as to what brands of coffee people have been buying to think Teeccino tastes anything like real coffee?

review/summary: Multipurpose mints, thankfully available online; great recycleable containers
review/text: I live in a major U.S. city. You can't find these mints ANYWHERE though the gum seems to be available almost everywhere.<br /><br />Thankfully, Amazon offers them. (Only negative is price. 1.2 oz tin even with amazon's somewhat discounted per-tin rate is still high IMHO.)<br /><br />First used them as a breath mint and they were refreshing and not overpoweringly strong in the mouth (Peppermint is the only one I like.). Very important that they are sugar free given personal health considerations.<br /><br />But the real value for me is how they help me combat "dry" mouth. I often find my mouth so dry that I start coughing really really hard. I pretty much always have water around but sometimes I'm somewhere where I can't just whip out a bottle. However, these mints work really well and start soothing and "moisturizing" my mouth and quickly help stop the cough.<br /><br />When we attend theater or musical concerts, I always keep these in easy reach. No paper to unwrap, just a quick pop in my mouth when I feel a cough coming on. (They should sell these at event venues!)<br /><br />We recycle the tins for all sorts of things, including to store and transport USB flash drives. I also use them to stash all sorts of odd little bits and bobs when traveling (they are great water-tight containers). I suppose the ability to reuse them makes the cost somewhat more acceptable.<br /><br />It would be great if they offered one giant-size pack and you could refill one small container from it. Much more "green."<br /><br />Don't understand why they aren't available at retail. I'm not a huge fan of buying in bulk on these since they last so long. But I'm grateful they're still available!

These had to be selling well at these stores (if no one else was buying them, I certainly was and 8 to 12 tins at a time too) so I don't know why they've been discontinued at those retailers. Their loss and Amazon's gain, I guess.

review/summary: Love these mints
review/text: Per my dentist, I needed to find a sugar free alternative to Altoids.  These mints are as effective as Altoids, but the flavor is much better and they are sugar free.  I used to get them at Target, but they quit selling the peppermint flavor.  Peppermint is the best flavor so I had to search elsewhere.

review/text: I love these mints, just like everyone else here. They are by far my favorite. Strong enough to get the job done after eating out. Yummy enough to make me want to eat 2. But why are places not carrying them anymore? Target, I used to be able to trust you. But lately, you haven't had these mints. I couldn't even find them at the evil Walmart. Does anyone know the reason why retailers are not stocking these anymore?

review/summary: DELETED ITEM SAVED BY AMAZON!!!
review/text: THIS IS A THANK-YOU LETTER TO AMAZON FOR CARRYING THIS ITEM THAT WAS DELETED FROM ALL<br />RETAIL OUTLETS IN MY CITY IN NORTHERN ALABAMA. DURING A TRIP TO INDIANA I FOUND ELIPSE<br />IN A STORE THERE, BUT AMAZON HAS IT CHEAPER, SO I WAITED TIL I GOT BACK HOME TO PURCHASE<br />IT AGAIN.  I HOPE THEY WILL NOT DISCONTINUE IT ANYTIME SOON, FOR IT IS THE ONLY<br />SUGAR-FREE BREATHMINT I HAVE FOUND ANYWHERE.  EVEN IF IT WAS NOT SUGAR-FREE, IT WOULD<br />BE A GREAT MINT THAT REALLY REFRESHES MY WORK DAY AND OFF DAYS.<br />AMAZON--TAKE A BOW!!!

review/text: You can't find these mints in the stores, and they are just nice tasting mints that I love to take with me when travelling, & keep them at work to suck on. I like the peppermint & spearmint flavors.

review/text: So glad to find these mints on Amazon and at a good price. It's been impossible to find the peppermint flavor at any local store.  Not only are they good breath mints but as mentioned in another review they have even been helpful for an upset stomach.
