review/summary: Liked Tuscan and Southwest.  Dislike BBQ flavor.
review/text: I enjoyed and quickly ate the Tuscan Almond and Southwest Cashew flavors of these nuts.  The flavor is quite strong, but good.  Lots of "flavor powder" coating every almond or cashew.  There was something about the Barbecue flavor that I don't care for, so those packages are still sitting around.  I'd give the Tuscan and Southwest flavors 5 stars... the Barbecue 2 stars.  (I do generally like Barbecue flavored products).

review/summary: Good flavor but way too sweet
review/text: I enjoyed all three varieties with the BBQ flavor being my favorite and the cashews being my least favorite.  I do find them to be a bit on the sweet side though and can't eat more then a few at a time because of this. Cane sugar is the second ingredient in 2 out of the 3 of the flavors.  I'd buy them again, but probably not in bulk.

review/text: I WAS SO EXCITED BUYING THIS ENTIRE LINE OF NUTS!!!! I LOOOVE THE CASHEW POMEGRANATE NUT ONE and i thought i would find another awesome nut flavor among their variety packs. WAS I SO WRONG. THEY WERE ALL GROSS. EVEN PPL AT WORK WOULDNT EAT THEM AND THEY WERE FREE. im only buying the cashew vanilla pomegranate from now on. if i had to choose a second it would be the almond sea salt one but i'd definitely never go for it over the cashew/pom.

I figured what the heck, I'll give it a try for the times I don't need to get my motor going...  Got a shaker of ice and 18 oz water and did the tea and lemonade mix first.  Well I'll be!  No after taste like Crystal Lite, and this is really pleasant to the palate.<br /><br />Okay so this was a well spent $12.50 with free PRIME shipping.  I got 3 boxes of 24 (total 72 servings) for a 16 cents per serving cost... Cool!  I did notice the price was jacked up to $38 today!  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot!!!???<br /><br />One complaint was the packing.  The boxes came a little crushed, and the seams were also broken on the box.  The sleeves of powder are fine though.<br /><br />Just ordered the Energy version for just under $12 for 72...

review/summary: Good price, delicious grain
review/text: So I'm biased because I love Amaranth and living in SoCal without a car means it's hard to get my hands on. I started googling around to buy online at one point and was amused to find Amazon sold grain but decided to go ahead. So I bought 20 lbs of quinoa and 10 lbs of amaranth from this seller about a year ago, give or take. The quality is fine (grain is grain), shipping was reasonable given it weights 30 lbs, and I've been eating it all year. Still have some left, but it'll be time for another order in a few months.<br /><br />Amaranth is great as a replacement for malt-o-meal or cream-o-wheat for the nutrition conscious, as a replacement for rice in many dishes, and I've even used it to make risotto with some home-grown mushrooms and asparagus. Quinoa has a more rice-like and less hot cereal-like texture than amaranth, but I prefer amaranth's flavor. They're both good though.<br /><br />For best results, dry toast in a cast-iron skillet (either grain) before cooking like rice. (I use 3:2 ratio water:grain for quinoa and 2:1 ratio for amaranth)<br /><br />Get used to the taste people...these are two of the only complete proteins found in the plant world, and as our planet gets more and more overcrowded we're going to be eating this and tilapia instead of meat. I, for one, won't mind!<br /><br />One word of warning: it comes in a non-resealable bag, so get some jars or old 2 liter soda bottles/milk cartons for storage. Should keep 1-2 years at room temperature or indefinitely frozen.

review/summary: reGen-er-ate!
review/text: One of the best things about reGen is it actually contains COCOA, not chocolate flavor.  It is the third ingredient!  Water, sugar, cocoa, milk protein...  Yes, it does have 200 calories per 11 oz.  That's a lot but in this case, it's worth it.<br /><br />This had a funny taste to it at first  - kind of like those plastic containers of children's chocolate milk that doesn't actually contain milk products -- but it was momentary.  It tasted better the more I drank it.<br /><br />This 3:1 formula is meant to accelerate recovery and it's exactly what I needed.  I have only recently broken out of physical therapy again and been able to go to the gym to lift weights.  The first thing I did was overdo it.  The second thing I did was overdo it.  That was also the third thing.<br /><br />There's no way of knowing whether this is working, not really.  It's a part of the entire picture of health.  They have made a website regen2recover  to explain about their theories about recovery.<br /><br />The hardest part about incorporating recovery drinks into my workout routine has been their flavors.  If you don't like the flavor, then you're not going to drink it.  I've tried a bunch of protein and soy mixes but I don't like most of them pretty equally.  They are chalky and dusty and take time to make.  They may be lower in calories but then add one banana to the calorie count and it all changes.<br /><br />This one is my favorite so far.  It's so much my favorite that I keep them in a file drawer.  Shhhhhh!

review/summary: Workouts are less painful a day later
review/text: I am a big fan of hard workouts with weights and drinking chocolate milk afterwards does help ward off the pain you feel a day later. Cocoa is a great antioxidant and increases circulation while the 3:1 carb protein ratio promotes muscle recovery. This is a convenient way to have it on hand as most chocolate milk requires refrigeration this one can be stored in the pantry and used both cold or room temp so you can take it to the gym. The taste is great, rich, thick and very chocolaty. It is an 11 ounce serving container and when compared to an 8 ounce container of Organic Valley brand chocolate milk they are not too terribly different. Here is a side by side comparison although please note, the serving (container) sizes are different. Nothing particularly special or unusual about this product however, it does have 5 gr. fiber and less cholesterol. It does taste quite good and like any chocolate milk, it helps reduce muscle fatigue and pain from hard exertion. Good product.<br /><br />  "Organic Valley" chocolate milk serving 8 ounce / "ReGen" serving 11 ounce (NOTE: DIFFERENT SERVING SIZES)<br /><br />  calories from fat:  160............200<br />  total fat:  2.5.............4.5<br />  sat fat:  1.5.............1<br />  cholesterol:  15..............5<br />  sodium:  290............320<br />  fiber:  1.................5<br />  Sugar:  25...............25<br />  protein:  9.................11<br />  Vit A:  10%............10%<br />  Cal.  30%............20%<br />  iron:  4% ..............6%<br />  Vit D:  25%............10%

review/summary: reGen Chocolate Muscle Recovery Beverage
review/text: ReGen is a good product giving a 3:1 ratio of carbs (35g) to protein (11g), along with some natural cocoa. It is great for on-the-go consumption and you can drink it at room temperature or chilled (it will make you thirsty afterward, though). This is a great product for anyone who lifts weights, as it gives you perfect post-workout nutrition.<br /><br />However, I think a glass of high-quality chocolate milk will to the same job for you. Studies show that chocolate milk aids the body in muscle recovery.<br /><br />It is really important to refuel after a workout - especially within the first 15 minutes. This is where ReGen really shines as a product. As a bonus, it tastes great.<br /><br />But, I'm going to stick with chocolate milk. It does the same exact thing for less money. If chocolate milk isn't an option for you (due refrigeration issues or some other reason), ReGen is a great replacement.

review/summary: If Gatorade and MuscleMilk made sweet, sweet love ...
review/text: Carb-fearing folks need not apply. Nor those who focus on low-intensity, non-metabolism boosting workouts. But for those who train hard, be it running, biking, swimming or lifting weights, reGen's new Chocolate Muscle Recovery is an excellent post-workout drink, offering a balanced 3:1 carb to protein ratio. For those uninitiated, a 3:1 carb to protein ratio has been established as a key balance for replenishing glycogen stores in the muscles, thus preventing catabolism (where your body breaks down muscle tissue as energy) and allowing for peak muscle/protein synthesis.<br /><br />I'm in the gym 5 days per week, doing a variety of strength training and intense cardio, so I'm always looking for ways to cut my recovery time. There are so many drinks on the market, that it's often a chore trying to figure what works best, but reGen is definitely a new drink of choice. Why?<br /><br />* Many post-recovery drinks don't offer the balanced 3:1 ratio of carbs/proteins<br />* the protein source is a quality protein isolate, which is more bioavailable to the body<br />* reGen has an ample dose of natural cocoa, which helps combat free radicals created during a workout, thus preventing cell damage<br />* lactose free (virtually, anyway), for those with dairy sensitivities<br />* excellent source of potassium and other electrolytes<br />* 5g of fiber?? This is awesome, as it brings the net carbs down to 30g, and gets 1/5 of your daily fiber into your body<br />* it tastes AMAZING<br /><br />Here's a breakdown of the nutritional data:<br /><br />Serving Size: 11 fl oz.<br />Calories: 200 Fat Calories: 40<br />Total Fat: 4.5g (7%)<br />Sat. Fat: 1g (5%)<br />Cholesterol: 5mg (2%)<br />Sodium: 320mg (13%)<br />Total Carb: 35g (12%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 5g (20%)<br />Sugars: 25g<br />Protein: 11g<br /><br />Vitamin/Mineral Profile:<br /><br />Vitamin A: 10%, Calcium: 20%, Iron: 6%, Vitamin D: 10%, Vitamin E 10%, Potassium: 15%, Magnesium: 25%<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Water; Sugar; Cocoa; Milk Protein Isolate; Contains 2% or less of: Canola Oil; Maltodextrin; Rice Starch; Cellulose Gel; Dipotassium Phosphate; Salt; Natural and Artificial Flavor; Magnesium Phosphate; Carboxymethylcellulose; Tricaclium Phosphate; Carrageenan; Dextrose; Vitamin E Acetate; Vitamin A Palmitate; Vitamin D<br /><br />Bottom line: if your workouts are intense and you're burning tons of calories, this is an ideal post-workout drink, containing elements your body absolutely needs in order to recover. Some may think it's a bit on the pricey side, each serving coming in at nearly $3.00, which is why I gave it only 4 starts instead of 5. But, sometimes you get what you pay for, and in this case, you're paying for a quality drink that will help elevate your workouts to the next level!

review/summary: Well Made & Tasty - I'm Sold
review/text: In the past I haven't had much luck with premixed protein/recovery drinks.  And of course, mixing your own can be annoying as well.  I've been looking for a good recovery drink for about 3 years now as I train for half marathons and until now I didn't have much luck.  I spent most of my time mixing powdered drinks in my blender - and rewashing my blender everyday.  Everyone knows that protein drinks don't mix well and tend to clump, so using a blender is always the fastest way.<br /><br />With the reGen drink, at first I was skeptical.  I thought I would have to shake the drink immensely and then of course still have clumps, but I did not.  The drink is smooth and, to me, tastes like Double Fudge Yoo-Hoo.  It's a chocolate milk like taste, but slightly thicker and more chocolately.  And of course, the drink does not need to be intensely shaken.  In fact I forgot to shake one and really didn't notice much difference.  The consistency seems evenly flavored.<br /><br />The protein level in this drink is perfect for runners & bikers, but seem a little low for weight lifters.  It has 11 grams per container.  I personally drink one for a 3-5 mile run and if I run 6-8+ miles I might have two.<br /><br />One thing I like is that they travel easy.  Even though they are basically like milk, they are easier than milk for my needs.  I often throw one in my backpack and take it with me to the gym.  After running at the gym, I drink it on the way home.  I usually stop to get a cup of ice at a convenience store to drink it with.  I think they taste best ice cold, but they do not have to be refrigerated unless already opened.  This makes it easy for someone to put in travel pack while hiking, running, biking, etc - unlike milk these will not sour in mild temperatures, but I would not subject them to 80+ degree temp for very long.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this product.  If you are looking for something easy & tastes normal - this is it.

review/summary: Convenient and especially tasty when chilled
review/text: Experts recommend that within sixty minutes of completing a weight workout, you drink or eat a mixture that provides a 3:1 ratio of carbs to protein to add in muscle repair and recovery.  While making a shake with protein powder, milk, and a banana or other piece of fruit is usually how I go this route, this reGen drink makes a convenient way to help your body with recovery.<br /><br />Here is the nutritional breakdown for this product:<br /><br />200 calories<br />4.5 grams total fat (7%)<br />1 gram sat fat (5%)<br />320 mg sodium<br />5 grams fiber (20%)<br />25 grams sugar<br />11 grams protein<br /><br />The high sugar content is where the carbs come in, and is comprised of maltodextrin and rice starch.  The protein portion comes from milk protein, which is more easily assimilated by the body than other forms of protein like soy.<br /><br />The cocoa taste is also delicious, and these are especially good if you keep them stored in the fridge.  If you're familiar with Muscle Milk Lite (which is the recovery drink I usually purchase), I think that the reGen has a richer taste.<br /><br />While it's true, as the previous reviewer noted, that drinking some regular ol' chocolate milk will aid in recovery, this has the added fiber and is also pretty convenient.  I could see easily tossing one of these into a gym bag so that it's handy to drink right after completing a workout.<br /><br />There are certainly more cost-effective ways to get a recovery beverage, but this is a fast, convenient, and easy way to re-fuel after a grueling workout.

review/summary: A positive addition to your workout  routine, with a footnote
review/text: There are countless supplements and sports drink products available with their manufacturer"s marketing departments often making extravagant claims about their benefits. In making purchasing choices, logic and common sense, of course, should be the deciding factors.  During any exercise or sports routine our bodies call on a fuel stored in the muscles and more so in the  liver called glycogen. Glycogen releases glucose, yes sugar, that metabolizes to power our activity. After strenuous exercise the muscles need to recuperate and glycogen levels raised as well as electrolytes, potassium and sodium, reintroduced into our system.<br /><br />ReGen's four primary ingredients are in order of percentage: water, sugar, cocoa, milk protein. The knee jerk reaction is to recoil that sugar is the primary ingredient after water. But sugar does need to be replenished. Cocoa is being touted more and more as a kind of superfood, in moderation, containing more antioxidants than any other food. It is said to have a plethora of health benefits. It's inclusion is more understandable when it is noted that it is manufactured by Apure Foods which is a subsidiary of Hershey Chocolate Co.  If you're asking yourself, what makes this product different than just drinking a glass of chocolate milk, you have a valid point, especially when comparing the cost, costing somewhere about 6 times as much as chocolate milk. No doubt there is a higher concentration of cocoa in reGen , also it is lactose free, if you are intolerant as most adults are to some extent.<br /><br />As for taste, I found it to be quite good with a deep chocolatey taste as would be expected. Its packaging is compact and so easily fits into a gym bag. As for results, that's something very difficult to determine. You need to replenish fluids and fuel and water alone is not sufficient; though water and a small snack, like an orange or even a dark chocolate bar with milk are advisable alternatives though less convenient.  In all, it may be a moot point since at least one web site purporting to be from Apure Foods, said the product has been discontinued though it remains in some inventories until supplies are all sold.

review/summary: Great Taste, good job!
review/text: I am a casual jogger. i spend at least an hour every other day in intense jogging some times more. I needed something to aid the recovery of leg and calve muscles. I have been into a little bit of weight lifting too. Usually, after jogging for an hour i have muscle aches that last till the next morning which means at times i only jog once or twice in a week. Since using this, i have found out that the aches no longer last till night. I sleep well and have been able to increase my jogging to almost a daily affair. I also need to mention that this is a great tasting drink. I had to hide it from my children who wanted to always take one. Unfortunately, i see it is no longer available on Amazon, will definitely order more when they become available

review/summary: Unsure of the muscle recovery benefits.  Positive it tastes great though!
review/text: While I cannot speak of the "muscle recovery" effect of this product or any measureable way to decide if it actually helps or not, I can say for certain that it tastes very good, especially if you are a chocolate lover.  Normally, I would prefer a drink much higher in protein content and lower in calories after a workout.  Unfortunately, that often means artificial sweeteners and other relatively unsavory ingredients (imo).  reGen is sweetened with good old sugar.  The protein source is isolated milk protein (whey), not soy, and that's good because I wouldn't touch soy with a ten foot pole.  The rich chocolate flavor comes from real cocoa of all things, and it really makes reGen taste GREAT!  Additionally, reGen is 99.9% lactose free if lactose is a problem for you.  Shake it up and drink this stuff cold out of the fridge and it tastes just like a rich chocolate milk, only better.  What a treat after a workout or mowing the lawn!

review/text: ReGen has a great flavor (it tastes like chocolate milk if one opts for the chocolate flavor) however, it contains too much sugar in my opinion. Some of the top of the line recovery drinks contain less than the sugar content Regen has. Overall good product but beware if you are watching your sugar intake.

review/summary: reGen Chocolate Muscle Recovery Beverage
review/text: I like this muscle recovery beverage after the end of a workout (I do an hour-plus 6 days a week, cardio and weight training), because after working out, I find I have kind of a panicky feeling, because I'm hungry.  I don't really know how much someone like me needs a fancy muscle recovery beverage, but the reGen beverage definitely helps get rid of that so-hungry-I'm-panicking feeling.  The taste is pretty good for this kind of beverage.  It reminds me of a Hunt's Snack-Pack Chocolate Pudding, just thinned a little.  And I really mean a little  You want to shake this stuff up good, because it's thick.  I'm a little conflicted on the 200 calories per serving, though.  I've read that if you drink some chocolate milk made with skim milk, that's a good post-workout drink, too, costing less calories than this one does.  But this is shelf-stable, easily portable, and for this kind of beverage, tasty.  If you're in the market for this kind of beverage, this one's a good pick!

review/text: I'm not a body builder, but I am very into nutrition science. Personally, I feel that this product is a waste of money. If you are serious about getting fit, you would use real foods to NOURISH your body. This stuff is all sugar. A little planning ahead and stocking up on real fruits and vegetables will do the trick for a lot less money, and save your health in the long run. It actually didn't even taste good. Do some research, too, before buying anything like this. You'd be better off following Crossfit protocol and sticking to protein,fats, and minimal starches while avoiding simple sugars.

review/text: I do work out some and was expecting to drink this only before my work outs for muscle regeneration. Surprise, the taste is extremely good and I because of the high protein and low calorie nature of the reGen, I find that in the last two weeks replacing lunch with one 11 ounce beverage satisfies my hunger and has helped me to lose almost 5 pounds with no other change in my routine.

review/summary: Shelf-Stable Sustenance
review/text: The manufacturer provides thorough details about the composition of this product, so my focus is on my response to it thus far. After exercise, my usual priority is hydration, especially because I live in a humid climate, which just adds to the sweating (sorry, I've been struggling with a more delicate way of putting this!).<br /><br />In those moments, my mouth and stomach prefer water; electrolyte or thicker beverages just don't appeal. I also wondered about the taste and stomach feel of something others had described as similar to chocolate milk. Would reGen taste or feel chalky or gritty? Would it sit heavily in my stomach? I read through the list of ingredients and the reasons for their inclusion and put my game face on, reassured in part by the product being lactose-free (more on this later).<br /><br />After several days, I was surprised to find that I wasn't dutifully sipping a carton of reGen to the bottom, I was actually enjoying the taste. No off-putting chalkiness, no subsequent stomach heaviness or discomfort, even on hot, humid weekend afternoons. Although the product provides a bolus of calories, the number fits within my daily intake.<br /><br />This product seems thoughtfully designed. It is 99.9 percent lactose free (a concern for many, and probably part of the reason it doesn't sit heavy in my stomach). The carton is simple to open and drink from. And while it tastes good cold, it also tastes all right at room temperature.

review/text: This product is different. I am thinking carefully as I write this to explain why. It tastes great. The real cocoa in it makes a real difference in flavor on the positive side. I plan to use this for making great healthy milkshakes in the hot desert this summer. I will buy this again but to be honest Im not sure if its really great for muscle recovery or not. Tried it after running with my dogs and hard several times and didn't feel much difference. However it is tasty,  I believe it provides nutriants and is not a waste of money. I will buy this again. Something I liked about it is it is lighter then a product like Ensure so for me was easier to get down when not truely  hungry. Have a happy painfree healthy day  *smile

review/summary: Glorified Chocolate Milk
review/text: So many people have written the breakdown of reGen, but the real question is: "does this stuff work?".  Well, for me, it wasn't too bad, but didn't make me work out any more or less than when I drink a Gatorade and eat gummy bears while working out.  I tried drinking reGen when I was doing a run (treadmill) and I found it easy enough to run and drink at the same time (punctured the top with a straw - not included).  Actually, reGen should consider adding a straw to the box, since the top has the "foil square" that you can rip off - this makes it easier for those who are on the go!  The drink itself is a little more sweet that I'd like it, but it wasn't jarring.  I found that my workouts didn't last any longer, but it didn't suffer either, so it was great for me.  All in all, it's a pretty good drink while working out, but considering the cost, I probably will stick to my Gatorade.

review/summary: Sugar Laden Chocolate Milk
review/text: I think this is a poor (unhealthy) product (and was very tempted to give it only a single star).  It's basically like drinking chocolate milk with added sugar.<br /><br />The marketing is based on the concept of the desirability of consuming a 3:1 carbs to protein ratio after working out.  In my opinion that is bad science.  Some doctors (the most public is Dr. Mercola) believe that if you consume (simple) carbs after working out then you have negated all the benefits of that workout.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Contains a good amount of cocoa (12g) (but they don't mention how that cocoa may have been processed)<br />* 525 mg of Potassium<br />* 5 grams fiber<br />* Sugar is used as a sweetener instead of artificial sweeteners<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Milk Protein Isolate - thus casein (and casein is well known to be unhealthy) - I would far rather see whey protein used (the healthy protein in milk) but that would have increased cost significantly.<br />* 25 grams of Sugar<br />* Cost - at the time of writing this review it is $2.83 per 11 oz - coconut water would be a *much* better choice at only about $2 per 11 oz.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by "science" which shows "benefit" by comparison with other unhealthy choices.<br /><br />And as a final point, it's so thick that it doesn't taste good to me.  It doesn't have good flavor.

review/summary: Good things and bad things
review/text: This drink is extremely tasty and goes down easy.  It has more calories and sugar than I'd like, but that ties in with the stated 3:1 carbs to protein ratio that they're aiming for.<br /><br />The manufacturer states that you should consume this product 60 minutes after your workout.  I know some people who question that and believe that you should drink it sooner, but I'm not going to claim to be the expert.<br /><br />I've used this product after working out with weights.  I didn't really notice much difference, but maybe it's doing something or other with respect to increasing blood flow to the muscles and such.<br /><br />I do find the cost to be too high.  As of this writing, a single 11 ounce container costs you almost $3.  Sure, I know that this stuff is expensive to ship, but I think the cost/benefit analysis is out of whack and it's simply too expensive for me.<br /><br />As a side note, I'm trying to lose weight and have replaced a couple of meals with this.  That's an off-label use, but I have dropped a couple of pounds for whatever that's worth.

Even though I lift weights and a recovery beverage is good, I have a difficult time drinking it directly after working out as recommended because it is so thick. I do better with water.<br /><br />This stuff would probably be optimal for large guys who need a lot of calories and don't mind a thick drink after a work out.

review/summary: Pros and Cons
review/text: As a personal trainer and long time weight lifter, I have used my share of protein drinks. So when I saw this offered as a test product for Vine Review program I did not hesitate. The first thing I did when I received this, was read the label. Although the product page lists the ingredients, the amounts in grams were not listed. After reading the label and trying the product, here are my Pros and Cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. No Artificial Sweeteners, just pure natural sugar. This is a biggie for me, as I stay away from Aspartame (also known as Nutrasweet or Equal) and I stay away from Sucralose (also known as Splenda). I could write a chapter just on these two sweeteners, but that's not the point of my review. So if you are curious about those I highly recommend googling them.<br />2. Decent ingredients, including Pure Cocoa which is very healthy and full of antioxidants. Also, the protein source is Milk protein Isolate, better than Concentrates, or protein from other sources such as soy. (If you want to do soy protein, get fermented soy.) There are some vitamins and minerals in this drink, not many, but decent.<br />3. Fiber: There are 5 grams of fiber in each serving. This is not enough for your daily needs, but very respectable for a protein drink.<br />4. Taste: This actually tastes good when going down. There is a little aftertaste, but compared to other drinks I've tried it's not bad at all.<br /><br />Cons: I guess my main con can best be described in the following way.... The marketing of this drink is geared to those who are looking for muscle recovery. Another reviewer mentioned that one could just drink chocolate milk instead. Well he makes a very good point and is essentially correct. This drink is touted basically for it's sugar and it's chocolate, both are ingredients in chocolate milk. The cocoa contains theobromine, as well as small amounts of caffeine. Because they are slightly stimulatory, they promote blood flow which helps to deliver the sugar in this drink into the muscles for recovery. Simple. But you can get that in much more inexpensive ways than through this product (Like the chocolate milk).<br />Another con is that this product has no additional ingredients, such as glutamine, creatine, or any other extra amino acids that are known to help with athletic recovery. Furthermore, the protein that is included in this drink is only 11 grams per serving. Granted, this is not marketed as a protein drink, but a muscle recovery drink. Basically, it's just an expensive, but convenient way to get sugar into the muscles after a workout.<br />My final con is that the label does list artificial flavor as an ingredient. I would like to know more about that, but that info is not clarified.<br /><br />All in all, I'm having trouble deciding how many stars to give this product. If I often found myself in a mood where I really wanted something quick and convenient, I might be more generous. But more often than not I'd rather stick with my good old Isolated Whey Protein powder (chocolate) with a banana in a blender. That gives me my sugar, my chocolate, and a heck of a lot of protein. And I can easily add some fiber to the mix if I want that also.<br />So for me, I can only see one benefit to this product really; Convenience. If the product was of great quality, I'd give it five stars. The quality of this isn't the worst but if it was, I'd give it one star. This is somewhere in the middle. Since convenience is a big factor in today's lifstyles, I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. Since the product is marketed as muscle recovery, and not as protein, AND since there are no artificial sweeteners I'll  be generous and give four stars. But it's a really iffy four stars!

review/summary: Apparently not gluten-free
review/text: This tastes like grown-up YooHoo, which if you like that--you're golden.  I was hoping for a more balanced protein beverage, though what I got was more like straight sugar.  The flavor is OK--not bad but not great.  It's very cocoa-y, thus a bit chalky no matter how well it's shaken.  It's also quite thin and not creamy--hence the YooHoo comparison.<br /><br />I would be willing to mix it with a protein powder to balance it out more, however it lists unsourced maltodextrin that I'm not comfortable with.  The product does not specifically say that the maltodextrin is not gluten-free, which leaves me having to believe that it is derived from gluten.  That said, I only consumed a few sips.<br /><br />Not for me, and from what I know of building muscle, way too high in poor carbs to aid much with that.  Round it out with a good protein powder and you may be on to something.

They use Real Cocoa which tastes good, and has anti-oxidants...<br /><br />The areas where the company could improve:<br />- only 11 grams of protein, but 25 grams of sugar! (maybe that's why it tastes so good!)<br />- pretty expensive.<br /><br />Here is the Bottom line (for me anyway):<br />- If you are looking for More protein, don't go with this product. You might as well just drink chocolate milk! I drink Rockview Farms 1 percent that I get at Trader Joes (milk without all the hormones and stuff), and it tastes pretty much the same, and is cheaper. (but it needs to be refrigerated and only lasts for so long). You would get the same benefits from drinking chocolate milk.<br />- If you are looking for a "post workout recovery drink" that this product claims to be, You might as well just drink Chocolate milk!<br /><br />- this product is good if you want something that you don't have to refrigerate.<br /><br />- the company could improve their product by doubling or tripling the amount of protein per serving. and if they put other good things in their product like creatine, more vitamins and minerals, etc.

review/text: I have tried many different "scoopable" cat litters in my years.  I had tried this litter (Fresh Step), but had decided on Tidy Cat for many, many years because it was cheaper than Fresh Step.  Recently Tidy Cat started not clumping the way it should.  It was breaking up the urine clumps and the broken particals of urine were than in the cat litter box until I did my big cleaning (taking out all the litter, and starting with fresh).  After seeing that Tidy Cat started cheapening their product I thought of Fresh Step.  I immediately changed my whole cat litter box and used FRESH STEP.... finally a cat litter that actually clumped!!!!  I am now returning all of my extra Tidy Cat litter in exchange for FRESH STEP.  Oh and I also found that if you by FRESH STEP in the larger quantities.... it is the same price as the lesser litter I was using!!! I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL LOVE THIS CAT LITTER!

review/text: I used Fresh Step cat litter for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that it was the best "bang for the buck" litter. It clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, it forms a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase this litter. Interestingly, after having this experience (twice, because I thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time) I turned to Scoop Away which I always considered to be a similarly good product, only to find the exact same thing. What the heck? Turns out both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!

review/summary: Great for sensitive digestion!
review/text: I adopted a cat about 8 months ago from the Humane Society, and discovered pretty quickly that he did great on canned foods, but dry foods would always give him loose stools if not diarrhea.  I'm fine with feeding wet only for the most part; after all cats do need a wet diet and dry foods are mainly just a convenience product.  But that being said, sometimes I'd like to have a getaway for 24-48 hours without having to arrange a pet sitter for such a short time.  Any longer than that and of course I'd have someone come to look after him, or take him with me.  I tried several brands of dry foods which were supposed to be premium, including Eagle pack Ocean fish flavor, Innova EVO, California Natural with Chicken and Rice (also made by Innova), and Blue Buffalo.  He couldn't digest any of them and I ended up donating all of them back to the Humane Society.  I finally quit experimenting and did what I should have done to begin with, called the vet.  They suggested I come in for some free samples of food, and I was given Eagle Pack chicken and rice, which the vet recommends for diarrhea-prone cats (and canine formula for dogs).  I literally cringed when I put a small handfull of it on top of his wet food for the first time.  Even the Eagle Pack ocean fish formula hadn't worked for my boy, but I've since learned that too much fish doesn't sit well with him.  I was so sure the Chicken formula would result in horrible, watery diarrhea too, but it did not!  His stools are really solid with this food, and I can tell he's feeling good too, by the way he cuddles and plays--he's older and the least playful cat I've ever seen, so for him to attack my leg is actually a big deal.  I don't understand why this food works for him when the Innova chicken/rice formula didn't, but I do have faith in Eagle Pack.  It's good quality, locally produced (at least for me), reasonably priced at my small local food store, and the ingredients all come from the USA instead of China.

review/summary: Quality Food at a Good Price
review/text: First off, every cat is different -- so if you suspect your cat is a picky eater, get a little bag before you try and save out on a giant one. All cats are different and it is absurd to rate a product low simply because your cat didn't particularly care for it. Second, of course it has some smell, the primary ingredient is fish meal. Almost any quality cat food will have SOME smell. If it doesn't it's probably not fresh or most of the ingredients are grains (not great for cats) and don't smell.<br /><br />The only downside of this cat food is that it does have some grain content, if you're a cat food purist this will probably deter you from buying this brand -- but you're also likely to spend a bit more (sometimes quite a bit more) on a grain free formula. Otherwise, the product is great. The fish is ethoxiquin free (ethoxiquin is a preservative that has been linked to cancer in high dosages), the chicken is free range/organic, and the 3 of the first 5 ingredients are named meat products (with no by-product). This is a high quality food at a great price. Will your cats survive on cheaper food? Sure. On the other hand, better food will improve their quality of life and can certainly reduce some potential health problems later in their lives.

review/summary: Fantastic Pet Food!
review/text: I purchased Dancing Cat after speaking with a friend who had been using their Laughing Dog Brave Dog Formula for her dog. My rescue cat had experienced several bouts of weight loss and lethargy and the vet could not determine what was causing it. I wanted to do everything I could to boost her immune system so I started thinking about how I approached my own health concerns. A healthy diet and eliminating "junk food" became a top priority! I am pleased to say that after 3 months on this product my cat is doing wonderful!! She has the most beautiful shiny coat (omega 3s?) and her energy level has returned to that of a kitten! thank you Laughing Dog Pet Products!!

review/summary: It's stinky
review/text: I have 3 cats... they are rather "non-finicky" when it comes to dry food. They eat it like any other food, but lawd, this food gives all 3 ATROCIOUS gas. I'm hoping (& praying) their digestive system will adapt & it will pass...quickly.<br /><br />I have been using other "natural" cat food - can't recall brands bc I put it in a plastic bin & toss packaging. No other dry foods have produced this "response".<br /><br />The food has a strong smell & packaging was challenging to open. I recommend using scissors instead of trying to pull it apart - difficult & food went flying.

review/text: I noticed that these rawhide chips are very thinm almost like potato chips, so there are more chips per bag than other brands.  The dog still loves them although she finishes a chip in a few short minutes and then asks for more.  I previously purchased other rawhide chips from Amazon that were thicker (from PetTime) and kept the dog happy for an hour.  I think I'll switch back to the other rawhide chips.

review/text: I've tried other kale chips that are chocolate flavor as well, which are also good, but this brand has a different texture. Not a bad texture, just different. The chips are more thick and bulkier: it tastes more like a biscuit than a chip, actually. I love my kale chips and always like trying different ones out, so although I've tasted other chocolate kale chips before (different brand), this one was a new try and it satisfies the sweet-tooth much more than regular chocolate kale chips, because of it's cookie-like consistency. I recommend.  But I personally like Kale Krunch's Chokalet Chip the best!

I really hope that let me subscribe and save at some point in the future!<br /><br />Regarding the product, this really is the best cat food. My cats' coats are beautifully soft and shiny, they have a good level of energy, and I honestly think it helps with shedding.  We recently adopted a second cat, who was being fed purina pro-plan. his coat was gritty and he shed like crazy, he was slightly overweight and kind of sluggish.  after about a month of avoderm, his coat became as soft as our other cat, lost the gritty texture, he lost the weight and has enough energy to keep up with his new friend. the kitties are healthy and happy - i won't feed them anything else.<br /><br />also, i concur with the other review about the salmon flavor, my cats didn't really care for it either.

review/summary: Oh, poo!
review/text: Our cats ran to their bowls to try their first bits of Avoderm dry food, properly mixed in with their regular fancy kibble. Being Maine Coons with crafty little paws and ambitious little brains, they managed to pick out the Avoderm bits and eat those first.<br /><br />Yum, a hit! It smells meaty and clearly appeals to them.<br /><br />But we won't be buying Avoderm again....the poo is horrific. Wet, runny, stinky beyond belief. My big boy, who did mind his manners and ate a graduated amount of the mix over a week as the bag described, had the worst reaction of all. Poor guy cried as he pooped, had diarrhea everywhere, and calmly climbed into the laundry sink for washing as if he understood he was a stinky boy.<br /><br />So yes, it is tasty and priced well, but the aftermath is not worth it. 12 paws and two thumbs down.

review/summary: I can't decide if the outhouse or my cozy toilet is the better place for this product.
review/text: After trying this for myself, I suspected that those high ratings were only illusions. My husband told me that company's consider these reviews as just another form of advertising and pay people to lie about a product's quality. I really can't imagine anyone thinking this product is drinkable, let alone, pleasurable. If you want a couple recommendations on decent tasting t-discs for your Tassimo machine, the Jacobs Latte Macchiato isn't bad if you add sugar. This morning though, I drank it after I tried the Voluptuoso and my mouth has a metallic taste to it. Not sure which one is responsible. Another thing, the milk in the disc tastes sour, but when you add sugar, there is a decent flavor there. For the 2nd decent beverage, you can take the Kenco Crema with some Coffee Mate's Spiced Pumpkin and Vanilla Spiced Chai (a liberal amount) creamers, with enough sugar, and have a nice smooth cappaccino. I've tried about nine flavors now, and the coffee, cremas, most lattes and cappaccinos, have the same inferior quality in looks and taste, as a cheap instant coffee, as well as, having your mouth taste like you just drank the contents of an ashtray. Kenco Crema is the only one that did not taste like nicotene. These are the coffees I've tried: Gevailia Cappaccino, Maxwell House - House Blend, Hag Crema Decaf, Jacobs Kronung, Carte Noire Voluptuoso Classic, Kenco Crema and Jacob's Macchiato. After finding one inferior brew after another, I've given up looking for a good cup of black coffee and/or cappaccino, for the Tassimo. Don't do what I did, which was believe all the positive reviews and downplay the critical reviews. My curiousity has been appeased after spending $34 in Tassimo beverages. Thankfully, 2 packages were free. Now I can either spend more money in S&H to return them, or drink all 56 cigarettes...coffee I mean. Oh by the way, for a tasty hot chocolate beverage, try Celestial Seasonings "Tuscanny" 1 bag made strong, followed by 2 pkgs Carnation Instant Hot Chocolate, with mini marshmellows, and hot water in a tall to-go insulated mug. Amazon sells both, but you can get the chocolate mix on sale for about $1.50 in a grocer.

Unfortunately for me, though, it turns out that my puppy has sensitivity to gluten, and Barley is the 3rd ingredient listed for this food.  I'd recommend this food for someone who wants a high-quality food for their puppy, but doesn't need grain-free.  If your dog gets incredibly gassy and has strong smelling, soft poop or loose stools when eating this, I'd suggest switching to completely gluten-free dog food.

I also find the recommended feeding amount keeps them slim and fit. My dad uses the adult food on his Shepard mix who has a sensitive stomach, and had great results.

review/summary: Not that great of a taste
review/text: I had read about this coffee in Life Extension Magazine and thought I would give it a try. They tout that you get more coffee benifit in less cups of coffe. I though the taste was not that great, we prefer a darker roasted coffee, so ended up adding it to our reagular french roast coffee so as not to waste it. Pretty expensive and not that great of taste. Will not order again.

review/summary: Not 100% Stevia
review/text: This is not 100% stevia as stated. The product contains more maltodextrin than stevia. I am used to purchasing 100% pure stevia extract powder and it is much sweeter. (takes much less to sweeten things) This product may be fine for sprinkling on cereal or to sweeten fruit but it was not what I was expecting. I am disappointed in this product that I thought was 100% pure stevia extract powder. One packet of pure stevia powder sweetens 2 cups of my coffee. It takes 3 packets of this product to sweeten one cup of my coffee. Kal Supplements still has the best stevia extract powder on the market.

review/text: My husband accidently bought me the wrong kind, "SweetLeaf" is the best.  This Columbian brand has Maltodextrin, and there is no place for it, other than used as a filler when they want to go cheap on the primary herb.  Don't like this one, don't know what to do with all these.  Good grief.

review/summary: Pleasant, well balanced flavors
review/text: This blend is very easy to enjoy. The pleasing but mild flavor of tulsi is brightened up but not masked by cheery lemon myrtle and a bit of warmth from ginger and a tiny kick of pepper in the aftertaste. The minty aspect just sort of blends quietly into the tulsi, it doesn't overwhelm. Overall, a pleasant drink unsweetened or with a little bit of honey. A great caffeine-free alternative to tea that has agreed with everyone I've offered it to so far, even people who don't care for most black or green teas!<br /><br />My only complaint is that the tea bags seem to be on the weak side - definitely use 6-8 oz. of water, not a big mug! Maybe I'm a bit spoiled by loose-leaf. I got this in tea bag version for on-the-go convenience, but I have had Davidson's loose leaf tulsi (plain, just tulsi) and can vouch for its quality.

review/summary: Coffee snob takes the low road... and is amazed
review/text: So here's the path that we coffee snobs took to Taster's Choice. My husband and I have had two espresso machines. The first was cheap and made great-tasting lattes, much better than Charbucks -- but it only lasted three years. The second was more expensive and, sadly, we never got it to produce anything as good as the first machine. To make matters worse, I had grown tired of cleaning up the mess after each use. I was hopeful when Starbucks introduced VIA, but no matter what strength/flavor I used, it was so harsh (acidic?) that it messed up my stomach. It cost a fortune to boot.<br /><br />Luckily, good fortune was just around the corner. About a year ago, while visiting some relatives, we were introduced to these little gems. Now I just put 8 oz. milk in the microwave for 2:30, stir in one of these, add a little sugar, and voila -- a latte that's almost as good as what our old espresso machine made, with no mess to clean up. If you use lactose-free milk, you can use even less sugar since the lactose has already been broken down into sugar that you can taste. This product is already much cheaper than regular Starbucks or VIA, but if you can find the large plastic containers of crystals rather than these individual packets, your cost per serving will drop even more.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are looking for an inexpensive way to have tasty coffee drinks at home without the mess of an espresso machine, this might just fit the bill.

review/text: I have to start by saying I am a "picky" coffee drinker and instant coffee was never found in my home. I received an offer for a free sample and I thought oh what the heck so I tried it and actually found it to be very good.  It is the best tasting instant that I have ever had.  It is nice to have this in the house for those times you just don't want to make a whole pot, I grab one of my larger coffee cups and two packages of Taster's Choice and I enjoy a nice strong cup of coffee.

review/summary: pretty good stuff!!
review/text: I'm a coffee snob, and also a coffee addict. This changed my mind about instant coffee.<br /><br />I travel and work in lots of places where coffee is sometimes not convenient, fresh, or simply not available.  I can literally tell what time of day it is by my caffeine withdrawal headaches if I miss my usual 9am, 3pm, and 6pm dose.<br /><br />These little guys are actually quite good, and super easy to carry.  I keep them in luggage, in my car, pocket, etc.  I carry a couple of them with me- as fellow addicts are always grateful that I share. LOL.  One may not always be able to find coffee, but hot water is often available. Alas, I've been in situations so desperate I've even added these to room temp bottled water!! (was actually not too bad if shaken vigorously, but it needs hot water to fully dissolve)<br /><br />Starbucks via is good,  but indeed overpriced. For as often as I need something like this, Tasters choice is the way to go, and it's enjoyable.  If you factor cost, convenience, and taste, it's a no brainer.<br /><br />This won't be the most incredible cup of brew you've ever had, but it's so much better than none!!!<br /><br />P.S The Colombian is much richer and tastier then the regular TC red box version.

review/summary: Excellent Instant Coffee, but wait! There's more!
review/text: First off, I am not a big-time coffee drinker. I love a cup of good, freshly brewed, medium roast coffee to start my day, but it doesn't always like me. Consequently, I decided to try Taster's Choice coffee sticks because of the convenience and not having a jar of instant go stale. For me, this has been a perfect option AND it's really great coffee! Also, I am firmly convinced that the coffee in the sticks is NOT the same stuff they put in the jars. The coffee in the sticks is way better, including the decaf. The 100% Colombian is tastier than the Original Blend, BUT WAIT! HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS!<br /><br />Taster's Choice just came out with a NEW FRENCH ROAST in sticks and (IMHO)it is even BETTER than the Colombian! It is a more rich, bold flavor but still smooth and easy to savor. I LOVE IT. The drawback is I haven't found it to be readily available yet, so if you find some, jump on it. Regardless, Nescafe has hit a homerun with their coffee sticks for flavor, cost and convenience. YEA!

review/summary: Best instant coffee, bar none!
review/text: I stopped using a coffee maker about 6 years ago when I moved to the Gulf Coast - the hot, humid climate meant I wasn't drinking enough coffee to justify making a full or half pot, and the single cup brewers like Keurig are still too expensive.  I discovered these little packets one day several years back while I was staying out in New Orleans - and they are definitely a game changer!  Not only do they have a true coffee taste, they can make either a nice strong cup of coffee, or a still-"real"-tasting mild cup of coffee.  And the 100% Columbian is the way to go - the Taster's Choice French Roast packets just don't do themselves justice.  Unfortunately, my local stores have stopped carrying the 100% Columbian - I tried finding a suitable alternative, but so many of the instants taste like watered down 3-day-old coffee, or coffee made from pencil shavings.  I guess I've been spoiled with this!  I was actually about to order a case from another site, when I decided to check Amazon... the price is better here, plus with Prime I can stock up within the next couple of days!  The only thing that would make this better is if Amazon put this on their subscription plan!

review/summary: A First-rate Cuppa Java!
review/text: For what it is, i.e., instant coffee, this freeze-dried concoction by Nescafe, certainly delivers. According to the label, this coffee is processed from 100% Colombian Arabica beans...the good stuff. Now, obviously, you're not going to be fooled into thinkin' that this comes across as a Melitta-drip Kona brew...and it doesn't. But, if you're not lookin' to impress the neighbors [or Lord forbid, the relatives] with the aroma of fresh-brewed, then this instant should serve you well. It is smooth, flavorful, and relatively robust...not as much as Starbucks VIA, but very close. On the flip side, since the Nescafe does not contain micro-grounds, it doesn't have the muddy texture of the VIA. As for preparation and clean-up, it couldn't be easier...zip, zap, pour, and stir...two minutes, tops. Lastly, at less than two-bits per serving, the Nescafe is at least three times less expensive than the VIA. There's yer 'bang-for-the-buck'...take that '4-bucks'!<br /><br />Amended [21 Jun 12]<br /><br />Please be advised, that this product is not exactly as advertised. Nescafe is engaged in some deceptive advertising schemes. On the coffee box, you will find claims like: "Tasters choice Colombian coffee is made from 100% Colombian beans." ...and... "Tasters Choice Colombian coffee is made from the finest Arabica beans." Now, I have no reason to doubt that these two statements are likely true. However, taken together, they imply that this product is made solely from Arabica beans, which is, in fact, not true! Notice that they did not say: "made exclusively from Arabica beans".  If you read the on-line product description, you will discover that this coffee is actually a blend of the superior grade Arabica beans and the inferior grade robusta beans. Think 'CYA' disclaimer! That certainly helps to explain why this coffee does not have the 'finestind' flavor and finish of my Eight O'Clock Colombian roast. Caveat Emptor! The instant coffee quest continues...stay tuned...

review/summary: One of the best tasting instant coffees I've tried, and I've tried many!
review/text: All 100% Colombian instant coffees (100% Arabica)always taste better than ordinary/regular instant coffees which are a blend of the cheaper, inferior Robusta beans and the more expensive but superior Arabica beans.  That being said, I like to emphasize that this is likely the best tasting NESCAFE instant coffee,  being made from 100% Arabica beans.<br /><br />I have tried many instant coffees before and this coffee definitely ranks up there with the best instant coffees.  Not the best overall based on my taste preferences, but definitely the BEST Nescafe I've tried in an instant coffee. (That includes Nescafe classic, Gold, Decaf and all other Nescafe Taster's choice varieties.)<br /><br />Currently, only one instant coffee beats this one based on my taste preferences and that would be Member's Mark 100% Colombian instant coffee which I gave a 5 star review.<br /><br />Overall, I'd rate this product (Nescafe 100% Colombian) 4 stars because it's my 2nd best choice for instant coffee and it is also overpriced in my opinion, being placed in wasteful packaging.  It would have been better if they placed it in glass jars like Member's Mark 100% Colombian instant coffee.  More value for money and less pollution to the environment.

review/summary: It really is better
review/text: I use "real" coffee, Eight O'clock Colombian, when company comes and then proceed to use up the bag after they've gone since once opened the coffee begins to degrade, even though I keep it in the freezer.  Once the bag is empty I then switch to instant for the interim.  I had been buying Tasters Choice sticks in Dollar General, six for one dollar, which I thought was a good deal, especially while they were including a dollar off coupon inside each box - but that promotion has ended.  Then I saw on Amazon that Tasters Choice came in an all Colombian formula.  Call me unadventurous but Colombian is my favorite coffee so I was intrigued.  Plus the cost was less per stick than it was in Dollar General for the original Tasters Choice.  I was skeptical about what difference the Colombian bean could make in instant coffee.  I thought maybe there was so much processing in the making of instant that any innate qualities of a specific bean would be lost.  I'm happy to say though that this all Colombian instant coffee is indeed better tasting, has a richer aroma, and is more robust than the original version.  The stick packaging is somewhat wasteful I suppose, but I really like the freshness and convenience.  I only use one stick a day so a large plastic container of instant would get stale before I used it up.

It may be indeed a good product.<br /><br />I received the item today (12/20/09) and the expiration date is APR2010. The short expiration period arouses a few questions for this purchase:<br /><br />1) While other Nescafe products I purchased from the same source recently have the expiration date around 07/2011, this lot is relatively stale.<br />2) The purpose for a consumer to buy the individually served coffee may be because of the preference to preserve the freshness, but this lot is about to expire by itself.<br />3) The package contains 160 single-served tubes. I need to be really quick in order to finish them before the expiration date. I don't want to drink the coffee in such a rush manner.<br /><br />I hope the supplier can provide a fresher product to keep the customer's faith of buying from them.<br /><br />I changed the rating from 3 to 5 on 9/5/2011 because the most recent delivery is freshly manufactured.
