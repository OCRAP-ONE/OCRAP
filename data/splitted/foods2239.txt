review/text: I received this product quickly and in excellent condition. No problems at all.<br /><br />This is my first purchase of the CET chews. My 10-yr-old dog used to crave his one Greenie treat per day, but after his last teeth cleaning, he needed 3 teeth pulled. I wanted something that would help keep his teeth cleaner. He seems to like these just as well as the Greenies! I think these chews will be better for him and less expensive for me.

She is a 5-lb dog (yes, I give her the medium size - the small size is "particle board" like rawhide, and it's not the same experience) and typically, little dogs get tooth decay and lose their teeth young in life.<br /><br />She LOVES these chews, and every vet and dog lover has been amazed at the quality of her teeth.  Should be noted, that I've read from multiple reliable sources that tooth quality in dogs affects their life span since it affects their nutrition in older age.<br /><br />I truly believe these chews have extended my dog's life - AND her quality of life.  They are worth every cent.<br /><br />(They smell like instant chicken soup, by the way)

review/text: These chews are not the same as the ones I get from the vet. Virbac adheres to strict quality control where all the chews are supposed to be the same thickness. I don't know if Amazon gets all the leftovers but the chews in these bags are all different thicknesses. Some are regular size and some are extremely thick. This is a concern for me as my dog had over $2,000 worth of dental work done and I don't want him chewing on anything too thick. These bags are cheaper than the ones I get from the vet and it shows.

review/summary: Choking Hazard
review/text: Please be careful with this product. My pug almost died today choking on one of the dog chews. I assume that the larger and smaller ones are fine, but my pug who weighs about 16 lbs (within the 11-25 lb suggestion) could not swallow the chew and got it stuck in her throat (after she chewed it until the point when it got wet and pliable). Thank god that my wife and I were in the living room to witness the accident. My dog fell over in convulsions while choking and my wife physically yanked the chew out of the dog's mouth. I think that this sized chew is very dangerous and you should think twice before purchasing it. If you do have a similar dog and want to buy this product, please supervise him/her!

review/summary: My dogs love this...and it's good for them too
review/text: A former vet tech of many years, we recommended CET chews to our clients. Back then, they didn't contain chlorhexiderm, but were quite effective as a dentrifice for dogs. With the added chlorhexiderm, they've only improved! My dogs find them just as palatable, but with the added benefit of anti-microbial properties most chews don't contain, it's something I can feel good about giving them.<br /><br />My dogs really enjoy these treats. I don't give them daily, just a few times a week. I strongly suggest pet owners be present when pets are using a chew. These should not be used a pacifier when you are away. Supervision is always a good idea as you never know if choking could occur.

review/summary: Poison
review/text: POISON "Chlorhexidine" POISON<br />We have two beautiful Saint Bernards. After using these for some time, it began to be a routine that they would BOTH have to go outside to vomit after their supposed morning treat and dental care. We investigated this chemical that the package warns you about, "Chlorhexidine" and stopped using the ignorantly designed dog hating treat. No more sick dogs.<br />If anyone likes their Dog at all, they will READ the package. Notice first the ingredient,  "Chlorhexidine" then the warnings.<br />There's good vets who don't sell these, and BAD vets who like the profits.<br />Of course, Pharma and all their "vet/doctor" salesmen will say this product has been tested, used for years, found to be safe in thus and thus quantities, and on and on.<br />Well, the chemical Chlorhexidine is used to KILL bacteria. GOOD AND BAD!<br />It's used pre-surgically, washing the body and prescription only mouthwashes.<br />Your dog, like all living beings has a body especially a digestive tract, FULL of very much needed bacterium.<br />The company knows this, and to protect themselves even warns that "serious" problems may occur, especially if your dog "licks" the surface first? Wow, and how is a dog supposed to NOT lick a dog chew he's sucking on for hours and yet consume it?<br />Do some research on what this stuff WILL do to your dog people. Unless your trying to euthanize your dog with a long, painful, and; "conveniently- racking up a massive vet bill to diagnose" and non treatable death sentence, STOP FEEDING THEM THIS POISON.  And YES, they are the same "intellectual scientists" who've managed to put half our nation on "safe for you" psychotropic drugs.<br />Ironically, "prolonged use of this poison will cause tooth discoloration," leading to possible other side effects of tooth decay."<br />Japan stopped using "Chlorhexidine" on catheters and other medical devices in 97' after many became sick and one died.<br />Causes numerous (still discovering more) problems with cats. Deafness, respiratory problems, in 96 in Mitchell South Dakota they discovered it was the cause of a plethora of severe issues with cats and had to stop using it. The believe it was from the cats "grooming" it off their coats after surgery. Too many problems to report here, do your dog a favor and do your own. And don't look get your information from the doggy sites. Look up the problems with the chemical. Is it like declawing your animal? "And they tell you it doesn't hurt them when they rip the dew claws out at the puppy age?" Yeah, I'd like to declaw a few vets (Pharma salesmen) and have them give me a report?<br />Most importantly, you do not want to kill ANY bacteria in your dogs system. PERIOD, that's why they've generally for so long, been so healthy, let's not screw that up as we have our own body's with infections causing Irritable bowel diseases etc.

review/summary: Please be careful.  These chews pose a strong CHOKING HAZARD.
review/text: These chews come in a wide range of sizes and thicknesses which means some chews will be easier to chew than some of the others.  I have a German Shepard/ Lab mix and she is now almost 4 and is a really strong chewer.  I really wanted this product to work because keeping my dogs teeth healthy and clean will help her living longer.  My dog choked on this so badly that she couldn't clear her own throat and luckily I was watching her to notice that she needed help.  I reached into her throat and pulled it out.  Stupidly, I thought this would be a one time deal so I gave her more of these and just a few chews later she ripped off another large chunk and choked on that again.Since it was so far down her throat I could only shove the piece down and it cleared her throat.  She laid in my lap for 30 minutes after that incident.  I threw the bag away and wrote a review and there were many other similar events like mine.<br /><br />Please be cautious and watch your dog if you think these work for you.  All it takes is one treat to choke on to create irreversible damages.  The manufacturer has very minimal consequences if your dog dies because of their C.E.T. chews.<br /><br />I have purchased the other types of these exact chews, but this company creates different listings for the same exact product because the other listings have poor reviews.  Also, if you look at most of the reviewers who give this product 5 stars only have 1-5 reviews...that makes me suspicious of those reviewers as it seems they are some how motivated to give this product a 5 star review.  Most of those 5 stars reviews are not even confirmed as actually purchasing this product.

review/summary: Highly recommended as "treat" with added oral benefits
review/text: I have 2 male Cavaliers, ages 5, 25lbs, and age 2, 11 lbs. My 5 yr old dog gets yearly cleanings but he was still getting bad breath type issues; the little one just turned 2 and he doesn't have these problems - yet. I decided to buy this product because it can be substituted for treats and contains Chlorhexidine which the Vet said is a special added ingredient needed for good teeth and breath.  I strongly believe the chews have substantially improved my dog's breath.<br /><br />Besides the oral benefits, the dogs are very happy when I ask them if they want "chips" (which is what I call the "chews".  The dogs lick them all over and I'd say for every 2 out of 3 they will keep at the chip until gone.  It takes over a few hours for the bigger dog to finish one. Be advised that these chips have a really strong, pungent odor but absolutely do not leave stains on fabric which is really important. Over time I've come to like the odd smell.<br /><br />The only thing I strongly dislike about the product is its really hard for me to open the bag; it is sturdy plastic with a resealable plastic zip but its so tight near the pull apart zip that it's hard to get to open.<br /><br />I recommend this product and order two bags at a time. The Amazon pricing is good and I'm a prime member (which I love).  I hope this review helps.

review/summary: God awful smell when the dogs were chewing!
review/text: I'm not sure what they put in these chews, but our family almost had to leave the room when our dogs were chewing. The dogs liked them, actually ate them probably too fast but wow, add some dog saliva and run for your life! Won't be getting these again. Alas, my dog still has lousy breath despite the claims of oral hygiene benefits.

review/summary: BEWARE! DO NOT BUY IF YOUR DOG HAS SENSITIVE DIGESTION!!!
review/text: I purchased this type of enzymatic chew to help control tartar build up on my dog's teeth.  I even verified that the additive Chlorhexdine is safe by contacting my Vet. I must say that my dog loved these chews  but they made her very ill for several days after just the first one.  She suffered from runny bowels and vomitting. The clean up alone was dreadful and so time consuming.  Of course, she's worth it, but I would never want to put her through this kind of debilitating experience again.

review/summary: My dog loves these, I hate them
review/text: My dog loves these things, item as advertised. However they stink! They especially stink once they get wet from dog slobber. Two rooms away we smell the awful stink. One time my husband gave the dog one of these while I was sleeping, and the awful smell woke me up. Now it's an outdoor only treat.<br /><br />We've had no choking scares which I see people mention, but my dog enjoys chewing things up, and thoroughly chews up everything before trying to swallow.

review/summary: C.E.T. Chews
review/text: I have to buy a bag of these at least once a month. The store that I have been getting them at does not carry the HEXtra Premium chews with chlorhexidine. They said I have to buy them at the Veterinarian's Office. My chihuahua and I are very happy to be able to buy them through Amazon for a better price, and no hassle. Delivery was unbelievably quick. Yes, my dog is small, but he can chew like the best, and the "small dog" size just doesn't do it. I also like the idea of having that extra (hextra...very clever) ingredient for his teeth, as I hear that small dogs tend to get more tarter than bigger dogs. Milo is one year and NO tarter!!

review/summary: you can lead a dog to a chew but...
review/text: My vet recommended these for my 2 girls (one Maltese, one Papillon mix).  Unfortunately, neither one of them like it!  It has a really strong smell.  The first time I gave it to them, the Maltese completely ignored it.  The papillon chewed on it for a while, but then lost interest.  I've tried playing with it to entice them but to no avail.<br /><br />The reason I give it 2 stars is because obviously, not all dogs like the flavor. Also, when my dog chewed it the first time, it turned the fur around her mouth and paws yellow... ick.<br /><br />From other reviews, it looks like most dogs take to it pretty well but I just know the potential drawbacks.

However, when I received them each chewie was half the size and paper thin.  These were not fit for a very small dog, let alone a medium dog.  I threw them away as I would not take a chance that my dog would choke on them.  I then decided to call the company.  I was told that they were aware of the problem and needed to do something with their quality control.  I ask her where they were made and she told me Mexico. BE WARE.

review/summary: Great oral hygiene , bad smell
review/text: I ( my dog ) have been using CET chews since we got him.  Previously was using the smaller stick when he was a puppy, but needed something bigger now that he is older.  Like the other CET sticks, he has great oral hygiene, good breath, nice white teeth, and no problems at the vet.  The only downside of this particular product is the SMELL.  My dog likes to sit next to me and chew it and I have to cover my nose.  It's an odd, nauseating odor that can fill the entire house.  I probably wont be buying these again for that reason, but will go back to the sticks without the odor.

review/text: I have been purchasing these chews for our two American Eskimo dogs (miniature and a toy) for years. My dogs really enjoy them, as soon as I go for the package they become excited. One thing to watch out for: particularly thick chews. Usually there are 2-3 chews that are thicker than the rest and very hard. I didn't catch this and one of my dogs broke one of their teeth on it. I still buy them, but I go through the entire bag and remove the thick ones.

review/summary: Poor quality control
review/text: My vet recommended them for my dogs which are around 20 pounds each and just will not let me brush their teeth.  They love them.  As with any rawhide chews, I only give them to the dogs when I am around to make sure they don't choke.<br /><br />I have two dogs, so when I came out with only one chew at the end of a package, I started counting the contents of each package.  I have found between 28 and 31 chews per package. There are almost never 30 chews as stated on the package.  I thought that perhaps they were packaging them by weight instead of count but that turned out to be not true.  The weights of the various packages were considerably different.  I called and they just said to return the short packages to my vet for a refund.  I did this once and as a result the vet opened and counted the three packages she had on the shelf -- they had 28, 29 and 31 chews each.<br /><br />There is also a large variation in the size and color of the chews.  Some are very light and some are quite dark.  I currently have one chew that is 1"x1.5" and paper thin, one that is 2"x3" and 3/8" thick, and one that is 2.5"x4" and 1/4" thick.  Some packages had mostly large ones and some packages had mostly small ones.<br /><br />I don't know whether they really help the dog's teeth or whether the chemical is bad for them.  But I do know that they have a serious quality control problem at the location in Mexico where they are produced/packaged.

If you have an avid chewer -- like my beagle -- get a mix of medium and large chews.

review/text: Great product and good for your dog's teeth - recommended by my vet. This product is sold in sizes according to your dog's weight.  The only problem that I have experienced is that sometimes there are a few chews in the package that are too small for my dog.

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE These Dog Chews
review/text: These chews are awesome for a teething pup or for a dog. My dogs love them!! We are having some pretty good success with diverting our new pup's chewing/teething habits from our furniture to these doggie treats. They are also good for the dogs, unlike the cow hide chews that sometimes cause torsion in dogs or the ropes that also cause intestinal problems. These are by far the best dog treats I've ever bought!

review/summary: My Vet recommended these, I get them through Amazon.
review/text: My dog was developing tarter on her teeth at a young age.  Her Vet recommended these chews to help relieve the problem in the hope of avoiding a full blown dental cleaning under anethesia.  I also brush her teeth three times a week before bed.<br />She not only loves the chews and asks for them each night at 8:30 on the nose but also her teeth are so much improved that she won't need the dental cleaning at the Vets.

review/summary: Dogs love it, me not so much.
review/text: I have a schipperke and what is supposed to have been a schipperke and they both love these.  It takes them a good 10-15 minutes to chew them apart.  The only downside I'd have to say is the horrendous smell.  I can only describe it as a rotting pumpkin stench that I get to endure each time I open the bag. I had bought this type of the CET chews by mistake as the bag looks very similar to the ones in the plain white bag when you're not looking closely to the image and when they arrived I thought maybe the company had just changed the packaging.  That thought was gone the moment the bag cracked open.  If pungent odors are an issue for you, you may want to look into the CET chews without the chlorhexidine.

review/text: My dog loves the chlorhexidine chews. They were recommended by our vet. As a puppy, he chewed through the small strips really quickly. He's graduated to the 11-20lb dog chews that are more square and tougher. Maybe 15-20 minutes of chew time. He loves them.

review/text: My dog seemed to love these when I got samples at the vet after her teeth cleaning. But then I bought an entire bag and she was over it, ha. I do really like the C.E.T. products since I have a small dog with bad teeth!! One caveat, they have this strong vitamin-like smell that lingers for a while. Suppose that is better smelling than those bully sticks!

review/summary: Not sure I can keep giving these to my dog
review/text: I have a German Shepherd puppy (14 weeks old) and bought the medium sized ones because I thought she would be forced to chew them and not swallow them whole.  I was wrong. She chews on them until the flavoring on the outside is gone and then swallows them whole---regurgitating it until she is able to swallow it.  So now that I know that, I take them off of her when I start to hear it and throw them out.  I probably shouldn't give it to her at all but Im hoping that eventually she will just chew them completely.  I don't want to waste the whole bag, which is pretty expensive. But technically my dogs loves getting these.....<br /><br />On the other hand, I have an adult yellow lab that loves the large ones.  She is used to chewing raw hide and pig's ears so she just chews it right up with no problem.

review/summary: Vet recommended
review/text: I always buy the Dingo brand mini bones. My dog loves them. She gets one after dinner every night. I never let her have a rawhide bone unless someone is with her. My Vet told me that I should give my dog these instead because they help reduce plaque build up on the teeth. The Vet even gave us one of the larger size strips. My dog did enjoy it and had no problem chewing and swallowing it. I found these on Amazon at such a good price, I ordered a bag for medium dogs. After chewing on one for a short time she started swallowing a large piece, choking on it, throwing it up and then starting over again. I took most of it away from her, but she still had a small piece that seemed to be a bit stuck in her thought and it took her a while to get down. She was fine; I didn't have to rush her to the vet butafter this experience, I will never give her these again.  We are back to the Dingo mini bones.

review/summary: Great Bones for Canine Dental Health
review/text: As recommended by the vet, I give all my dogs these bones.  They are a good teeth cleaner and dissolve after a while, so there's no worry about them 'over-doing it'.  I have older dogs, and one had almost no teeth, but she *loved* chewing on bones.  So, I tried these, and she was a happy camper, because she could gum the chewie right along with the other two dogs--no competition or feeling left out :)

review/text: C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral Hygiene Chews with Chlorhexindine, Medium Dogs was recommended by our vet because our dog was beginning to have some tarter on her teeth.  He sold us a small package, & the dog loved them. We were able to get a package twice as big from Amazon for only a couple of dollars more. Our dog still loves the chews, & her teeth look very clean.  We have recommended the chews to two other dog owners and their dogs have been as happy with the chews as our dog.  I would much prefer to purchase the chews than have the dog put to sleep to have her teeth cleaned.

review/summary: Unsensible Amount of Apple Chips
review/text: I excitedly bought the tropical blend, orchard and berry mixes of Sensible Foods hoping that I had found a cheaper alternative to Just Fruit Munchies. My plan was to mix all three varieties together and get my own blend, which would also have given me some extra fruit that the other brand's mix doesn't include. The problem is that you hardly get any other fruit but apple! For example, there were 2 pieces of banana in my tropical blend. C'mon! That's just a rip off. The snack is good. And the snack is crunchy. But now I know that my Just Fruit Munchies cost more because you get a fairly even distribution of all the fruit, not just a light sprinkling of fruit between apple chips.

I have been trying to eat more "whole foods" and the fact that these contain "nothing else" is a big plus.  I do wish they were a little cheaper, but the price on Amazon is better than buying them in the store.
