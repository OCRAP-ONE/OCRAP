review/summary: My kids loved this!
review/text: I was really happy with the fact that my kids loved this food!  Even my older kids like it!  It is a great way to get them to eat veggies!  My daughter likes to eat it right out of the little pouch!  She cannot even wait for me to get it in a bowl!  I love the unique flavors that this company has for their foods and that the foods always taste fresh!  Also very yummy mixed with cream cheese!

review/summary: Wonderful and Easy
review/text: My baby started refusing baby food at 9 mos and my 2.5yr old is a picky eater. I started ordering all of the different flavors of the HappyBaby and HappyTot (which has the magic supergrain Salba in them)line through the automatic delivery service (which lowers the price/amazon mom's helps too) and I call them smoothies. My toddler gobbles these up and asks for more! Even the ones that are green bean, peas, pear, and salba. It's like a miracle! My baby eats them too, but not with quite as much enthusiasm. It makes me feel so nice that my kids are getting some good for them stuff and I don't need to break my neck trying to do it. Oh and they are wonderfully anti-messy. I shove a few in my purse when I know we will be out during hungry times.

review/text: I am a mom of 3 kids. My youngest is always on the go as we take her older siblings to their sports practices and games. I was so happy to find a non-breakable, organic, BPA free food for her. I keep these in her diaper bag so when she is hungry, she always has a healthy meal. She likes them all but her top two are spinach/mango/pear and sweet potato/apple! I love that they combine fruits, veggies and super grains!

review/summary: Great Flavor but VERY thin
review/text: All of the Happy Baby Stage 2 Foods I have ordered have had an excellent flavor, but the puree is a very watery consistency that requires me to mix in cereal just so it holds onto the spoon long enough to make it to my daughters mouth. If your baby is past basic introductions where you water it down to a soupy consistency I would try another brand or the next stage or two up. Very disappointed because the flavor is great.

review/text: I like the idea of the pouch baby food, but I was hoping that with a baby on the cover and a Stage 2 written on it, that it would be thicker. It was almost like water. It was a disaster. Maybe these are meant for older kids that get the concept of sucking them out of the pouch instead of being spoon fed to infants.

review/text: We're big HappyBaby fans here, and this flavor pouch is one of my favorites for my son, who is now two. I tried to make my own baby food for him when we were first introducing solids, but I had trouble finding all the fresh organic fruits and vegetables during certain times of the year -- and apricot was one of them. I would have never thought to combine apricots and sweet potatoes on my own, but the combination works! I love that it is really nutrient dense and an easy snack for on the go. My son is in the picky-eater phase and these pouches help get the veggies in! I also think this pouch is the reason behind his current love of dried apricots :) Overall, this is a great flavor combination and a super nutritious food for little ones.<br /><br />I don't find that these pouches are runny like other commenters have mentioned, FYI.

He is now 16 months and it is one of his favorite HappyBaby flavors.  In fact, he just gobbled one up at lunch today.  He is at the age where giving him snacks on the go is difficult.  I don't always have time to do a bib and highchair for snacks.  I can give him this pouch and it keeps him satisfied until lunch or dinner, and I know he is consuming food that is good for his growing body!

review/summary: Update: Runny Consistency Good on the Go!
review/text: My daughter loves this (as well as every other Happy Baby food she has tried)! The only reason I docked a star is because the consistency is thin. I normally mix all of her Stage 2 foods with cereal, so it's not a big deal for us. However, if your baby eats this straight, try one of the various "squeezie" spoons on the market. It is too runny to use a traditional spoon.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I changed my rating to five stars. Yes, it's still a bit runny. However, I have found this to actually be a good thing.<br /><br />My daughter is almost seven months old. We were out the other day, and I had a pouch of this food in the diaper bag. I had just gotten her seated for lunch when I realized that I'd forgotten her bowl, spoon, and cereal to mix with the food. I decided to let her try to "eat" it directly from the pouch. (We both drink homemade green smoothies a lot. The consistency is similar.) It was great! She was easily able to suck it out of the pouch, with me holding the pouch, making sure that there was always food near the opening. She only spilled a tiny bit onto her bib. It also took less than five minutes for her to eat!<br /><br />I am going to keep a pouch of this food in the diaper bag from now on. It's great that I don't have to worry about carting a bowl, spoon, and container of cereal anymore. However, I will continue to mix it with cereal at home.

review/summary: Used to be the only way I could get veggies down my baby!
review/text: Before trying these pouches, I would attempt to hide veggies in my daughter's baby cereal and fruit puree.  I could put the tiniest bit in her bowl and she would always detect it.  I'm sure she would have survived without veggies, but it still bothered me that she wasn't eating any.  (It's a mom thing I guess!)  I saw these in the store and thought that the combinations of fruits and veggies in these looked "interesting."  I picked up a few, not really expecting my little one to like them.  However, she really liked them - a lot.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they come in a pouch that she can feed to herself.<br /><br />Not only were these great to give her as an infant, she still enjoys these as a toddler.  These are great to take with on outings - when it's otherwise difficult to give her produce.  She can eat these without making a mess and we don't have to worry about spoilage.  So far, she has liked all of the flavors.  I like the fact that these aren't stored in plastic or in jars with BPA.  I wish that these would have been available years ago.  :)

review/text: My daughter absolutely loves this brand of baby food. It tastes good. It has a little bit of a bite to it because of the cherries, but it is easy for my two year old to hold and squeeze out the food herself. I have recommended this brand and flavor to other moms.

review/summary: What a great snack
review/text: These pouches are wonderful to keep in the diaper bag. They do not require refrigeration or heating so it's great for on the go. My son likes to hold the pouch and feed himself (warning: I always put it in his mouth for the initial squeeze or else he will squeeze so hard it flies in the air).  I also use them in the house for those days when he says no to all other foods. He has never turned down one of these pouches. Figure it's more nutritious than eating goldfish crackers for a meal.

review/text: The apple-cherry pouches are great snacks for any ages.  The consistency is not watery, but like applesauce consistency.  The cherry flavor is really delicious and I love that it is organic ingredients with vitamin content!  My child loves them for preschool snacks, we squeeze them on our oatmeal and even substitute them for oil in our baking recipes.  They are a quick snack for on the go parents as well!

review/summary: Most convenient way to feed a baby ever!
review/text: I love these little food packs.  I squeeze the puree directly onto a spoon and feed my baby, and that way no dishes get dirty other than the spoon.  He loves these purees, he'll eat any flavor and they seem quite natural and healthy.  As he gets older he can even suck directly out of the pouch, though sometimes he squeezes too hard and makes a little mess if I let him hold it himself.  They are also super portable and conveniently stored.

review/summary: Great for Babies AND Kindergartners!
review/text: So I bought a couple of these for my son's birthday party to put in a goody bag for the babies that were attending. The moms went crazy over them. I don't find the consistency to be thin like other reviews have expressed. In fact, I ended up using the left over pouches for my 5 year old daughter's lunches. I used it on her almond butter sandwiches instead of jelly. So I thought the consistency was fine.<br />The taste was obviously delicious as my daughter didn't even notice the difference. Plus organic, no GMO, BPA free...can't really beat that.

review/text: so, i have tried this ine the beets with bannans and Peter rabbits squash (orange packet) my son (16months) loves these. he can open the pouch himself walk around and self eat, now with him running all day it is hard for him to sit and be still with this at least he can run around and still have something in his tummy. I highly recommend this product and company. no gmos and organic what a mom wants in food that she didnt make. it is thin but makes it easy to eat out of pouch with little to no sucking involved. i even like them, but i try all food before i give it to my son, quite tasty!

review/summary: Unlikely reviewer
review/text: I was so impressed with this product that I felt compelled to write about it. My 14 month old picky eater would not eat ANYTHING but toddler formula and english muffins. I started cooking for him since he was 5 months old and he ate well but something happened when I went back to work and he no longer accepts "good" food. However, he happily ate entire pack of HappyBaby Spinach, Mango & Pear and asked for more two days in the row! My husband is a Mr. Mom for now so weight off his shoulders as far as feeding. We ordered other flavors and hoping trend with eating organic veggies and fruits will continue with our picky eater.

review/text: My 8 month old has eaten nearly on the flavors of ellas, happy baby/tot, and sprout meals.  This one is so tart, she shuttered with a sour face and then started to cry- something that NEVER happens.  I tasted it and it is pretty sour (I like sour), perhaps overwhelmingly so for a fresh pallette (not a beat up adult one). I served it along with a savory meal and she was fine with that but I wont be buying it again.  May be good for an adult smoothie where you want some tang.

review/text: My son has been gobbling these pouches down since he was just over a year old (he's now 2 1/2).  They are such a fantastic way to get quality foods into picky bodies.<br /><br />However, this is the only combo that he has refused to eat.  I've tried it multiple times, and he continues to leave the pouch full after taking just one sip.  The rest he will slurp down until even the air is out of the package ;)<br /><br />I'd order any of the other combinations if I were you.

review/summary: Best way to keep my toddler eating his veggies!
review/text: My son has a very high gag reflex and transitioning to solids has been a task.  However, he also won't have anything to do with homemade baby food anymore.  We found these pouches when buying food for a trip and he was hooked.  I like that the veggies are organic, the pouches produce little garbage, that he can feed himself, but most importantly, that it is keeping the taste of veggies in his diet while we slowly work on chewing veggies.

review/summary: An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee
review/text: One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like "I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the "Original Donut Blend" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those "special" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]

review/summary: Our Top Choice Coffee
review/text: When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of<br />K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied<br />from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types.  We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating<br />of one point meant "Perfect, couldn't be better", and five points<br />indicated "Don't like this one".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.  We do not<br />prefer the weaker strengths.  The Parisian Nights has great flavor and<br />aroma with no bitterness.  This is a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two<br />months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee.

review/summary: Best Chocolate Flavor by Far
review/text: I'm a chocoholic and have tried every mocha, swiss almond chocolate, etc. coffee I've ever seen, k-cup and not k-cup.  This is the best.  It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.  Enjoy!!

review/text: I bought a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas this year. We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good.

review/summary: Need to brew small cup size.  Check the price!
review/text: I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this.  Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans.  We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally.  I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery.  I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed.  I usually brew on the 3rd largest size.  I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes.<br /><br />This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews.  Those who can only brew (or choose to brew) smaller sizes probably like this coffee.<br /><br />Make sure you check the price before you buy.  Click more buying choices to get to Amazon's price which is almost half the price of Liquid Nation's and it is eligible for prime.  Why doesn't that show up as a default?

review/summary: If you prefer a smooth cup of coffee
review/text: I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to "double brew" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off.

review/text: I'm not sure why everyone is hating on these; I think they are delicious. Perhaps they had some other taste in their mouth and it mixed with the snack. I found it very tasty. The pieces are crunch, but not overly hard like the freeze dried bananas that you get in trail mix. I would say they are just a little harder than a potato chip. I found that as you where chewing them little pieces would get stuck in your teeth, but it was a minor annoyance. Give them a try, if you don't like them then at least you know you tried them.

review/summary: Thin and Weak
review/text: When I was a kid, my mom would save money by making Tang with less than the recommended amount of powder. That's what this stuff tastes like. The first two ingredients are water and corn syrup, which I guess explains the flavor, like a thin orange soda that's gone flat. And despite the claim to be "Vitamin C Fortified," that's the only nutritional value this stuff has. It doesn't even have very much of that. So with little flavor, little texture, and little nutrition, I have to ask: what is this stuff? And why did I pay money for it?

review/summary: Great Start to the Day!
review/text: Let me preface by saying that like most drinks on the market today this one only contains 10% and is mostly water. That being said, I LOVE IT! It's a great morning beverage for me for a couple of reasons. First, its a nice portion and can carry me all the way up to lunch at work. Second, I have a bit of trouble with orange juice as in the real deal, because my stomach acids and such don't handle it like they did when I was younger and the blend on this has never given me heartburn even on  the most stressful days! In addition, the drink is consistent, can after can the taste is the same, which you can hardly say about other beverages in this category. Lastly, it has some nutritional value as well, albeit not as much as I'd like with 25% of the RDA but still enough to help fight off the office yuckies. I can purchase the product locally for $.99 a can and when I initially purchase it here on Amazon I was able to find a seller for around $.75 a can and with Amazon Prime it was a great savings.

review/text: I am not convinced this product is organic and will therefore not buy it again. The packaging on this product leaves me wondering how organic "Healthyway Organic Goji Berry" really is. There is no independent verification authority to confirm that this product is really organic. As far as I can tell, it is not certified organic by any authority other than the supplier and distributor. The 'Nutrition Facts" on the label have some strange entries like "Quantity of Heat" and "Thick Protein" which I do not understand. They sound like direct translations of Chinese to English. It is a "Product of China" as are most goji berries I have seen. My concern at a time when there is so much bad publicity related to food products coming out of China is that this product may be "organic" in name only and not in fact.

review/text: We have been using the espresso grind of Sant' Eustachio for some time as an alternate to our more robust Italian espresso at the American Espresso Coffee Cafe, in Garner, Iowa. It is the smoothest coffee I have ever had. Besides the wonderful flavor, the gentle scent of wood in the aroma heightens the experience of this great coffee. It may very well be the "best coffee in the world". I know it is the best that I have every experienced. Our customers love it and often purchase a can from us for home use.

review/text: These beans make a delicious cup of coffee.  I was originally distressed by the sell-by date on the bottom of the can--it seemed that the beans were old, but communication with the seller confirmed that the sell-by date is the European standard not the American and my beans had two years to go.  The seller and I continued communication by e-mail and discussed grind, grinders, pots, and of course, the cafe in Rome where the fragrance of roasted coffee extends throughout the neighborhood.  All in all, my purchase was entirely worthwhile, especially because the coffee is so distinctive and delicious.  Buy it!

review/text: Low acidity and medium-level roasting... therefore it's a good one to drink as an espresso shot without milk. But it's also tempting to try and make as good coffee (with milk-foam and sugar) as they make at San't Eustachio in Rome. A bit hard to find in the US... that, as well as the fact that the beans originate in fair-trade farms, justifies the higher price than other Italian espresso.
