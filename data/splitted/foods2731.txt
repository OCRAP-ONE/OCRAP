review/summary: Disappointed in texture
review/text: It is close to impossible to find a cookie that is both soy free, wheat free, and the only sugar that is used is from natural juices: apple, etc. That is the only reason I gave the cookie such a high ranking...<br />As for taste, the chocolate flavor is pronounced, I enjoy the "crunch", however, the texture of the cookie has a lot to be desired. The cookie needs to either be crunchier or more moist. As is it wants to stick to the roof of your mouth, and is just odd. Making it unappealing. If I had tasted the item prior to ordering, I wouldn't have bought a whole box full.

review/text: i have enjoyed this product for quite some time.  however, i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing!  at $35 per case, customers are paying more than $4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous!  i will find a healthier, more reasonably priced snack to munch on. shame on nana and amazon. . .

review/summary: I Don't Have Any  Food Allergies
review/text: I love these banana cookies even though I can eat any other brand/ingredient.  Yes, the texture is DIFFERENT, but that's what I really like about them.  It kind of reminds me of mexican wedding cookies -dry, melt in your mouth texture.  They are really expensive compared to name/store brand cookies, so I have to maintain my self-control and eat only one every few days :(

review/text: I tried the Nana's Bananas cookie bars for the first time this week. I love them! I don't have any gluten issues so I can't speak for that, but I really enjoyed the real banana taste of these cookies. Some people complained about the drier texture, which I will admit is a little different than an actual cookie, but it I always have it with something to drink anyway so the drier texture is not a problem for me. The cookies are nice and soft and there are little delicious crunchy bits in the mix. I bring them to work for a nice afternoon snack :) I will definitely be buying them again soon!

I bought these because the texture and taste remind me of the Cosmic Brownies I ate when I was a kid, the super unhealthy ones by Little Debbie.  Nana's Fudgy Wudgy Cookie bars are so much healthier and pretty darn close to the real thing(without the fudge topping)... They are delicious and a healthier blast from the past for me! YUMMMMM!

review/text: The berry vanilla is one of my favorite from Nana's.  I also like the chocolate munch when I am wanting something with a chocolate flavor.  They are dry amd crumble.  That doesn't bother me.  I have been gluten-free for five years and have tried near everything.  Nana's has become part of my weekly grocery list.  They are easy to take on the go.  I think these would be great for parents with allergic children because they are packaged for on the go.  It can be frustrating to be out and you suddenly get hungry and there is nothing gluten-free to be found.

review/summary: Moderately tasty, gluten free
review/text: Our family has members who keep kosher, who are vegetarians, who are unable to eat gluten, etc.  This cookie covers all the bases, but tends to be soft and not entirely tasty.  However, they can be used to make a gluten free pie crust, which is a great feature.  I have the feeling that if they were baked a little longer they would be better.<br /><br />Really, though, how good can a gluten free cookie be?

NO eggs, NO dairy, NO refined sugar, NO hydrogenated oils, NO Cholesterol, NO Casein, NO Soy, NO Corn.  They are made from natural ingredients and sweetened with fruit juice.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, for the average person these do not taste like a regular cookie.  I do not personally like the texture, but the chocolate flavor is good.  I will say that this is a wonderful product for people with food allergies, but not someone who can have regular cookies.

review/text: These cookie bars are fudgy and yummy and tasty and healthy and...<br />So good!!  I am a big fan of these.  When I order a case of these I always think, "man that is a lot of cookie bars!  I am probably not going to be able to finish them all."  Probably being the operative word.  Well low and behold (with the help of my husband and 6 year old daughter) they are gone quickly and we are ordering more.  If you are adding more whole wheat to your diet, these work.  If you are looking to get rid of refined sugar in your diet, these work.  If you order them and don't like them: you must have been one of those really picky kids that grew up to be a picky adult!  They are fabulous!  To eat them is to love them.

review/summary: My son loves these cookie bars!
review/text: My 8 year old son has numerous allergies plus autism and these cookie bars are a life saver!  They're made with fruit juice as opposed to cane sugar, so I don't feel bad about giving them to him.  We've tried many gluten free cookies, these are by far his favorites!  Unfortunately the local stores don't keep them well stocked, so I'm glad I found them here.  If you're not used to gluten free products, you probably won't like them.  The texture is very different than wheat, but if you haven't had wheat in quite a while, these are very tasty and not as crumbly as other gluten free products.  They are fabulous cookies and I'm so glad Nana's makes them...don't ever stop!

review/summary: Cookies you don't have to feel guilty about eating!
review/text: I was excited to find Nana's line of gluten-free cookies, and have tried all the varieties that they offer. Of the various flavors and styles of cookies, these are my favorite. I find their individually packaged cookies (the large, round ones) to be way too heavy for one meal and end up splitting them for two snacks. These 8 pack cookies are the perfect size for a little snack or to keep in your purse. I can understand why some reviewers might not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste, and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals. I happen to like the berry crystals, and it's nice to eat a cookie that you don't have to feel dietary guilt over! A great "hearty" cookie that goes well with coffee or tea.  Also, I am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever. In my opinion, a good product. However, because it is natural and doesn't have preservatives, the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging, the better. I have noticed that Nana's cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around, even sealed. Probably a good idea to try this product before buying a case of it, because I have noticed that people either seem to love or hate the Nana cookies.

review/text: I love Nana's GF lemon cookies, so I figured I'd try these berry vanilla bars too.  They're a nice, soft texture but I am not crazy about the taste.  I feel strange about the berry flavoring in a cookie with no real berries, just little dried crunchies sporadically in the cookie.  I think I will try the chocolate bars next time around.

review/text: I know what you're probably thinking: They're vegan, they're gluten-free...they're a dream come true! The taste of these bars is very banana-y<br />but I doubt you'll be able to ignor the texture long enough to enjoy that. The texture is akin to eating a handful of dirt (I'm no dirt-eating pro...but when I was trying to chew that's all I kept thinking). Please...if you're thinking about trying these...go down to your local natural foods market and pick up a box there first...while you're at it you may want to get some of your favorite soymilk...and lots of it!<br /><br />PS<br />If you're in the market for a yummy vegan bar...try the Betty Lous brand...The strawberry is super good!

review/summary: My kids LOVE them
review/text: When I found out two of my children were allergic to dairy and eggs, it was quite an adjustment.  Fortunately, we found Nana's Fudgy Wudgy Bars fairly soon after their diagnoses.  The kids think they are delicious, and I love them as a parent because they are a bit healthier than most "treats".  They are also conveniently packaged so that if we go to a birthday party, the kids can just grab a bar, and take it with them so they aren't left out when cake is served.  I give a package to their teachers too at the beginning of the year so that if there are any special occassions celebrated at school, my kids still get their treat.  The fact that my kids consider them a special treat, they must really be yummy, although I have yet to try them myself.  BTW, we tried a few other flavors of Nana's bars and cookies, but this one is the only one my kids like (or should I say love).

review/text: After eating this product, I had a stomach ache followed by hours on the toilet. Those of you with a gluten intolerance and Celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean... somehow this product is contaminated with gluten! It is NOT gluten free! Please spare yourself the pain and suffering. These cookies are not worth it.<br /><br />For those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free, please keep these facts in mind:<br />1. If you eat gluten, it damages your intestinal lining.<br />2. If you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms.<br />3. If you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption, increase your risk for intestinal cancer, and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility, autoimmune disorders, oteoporosis.<br />In other words, cheating on your diet is not worth it!<br />Don't eat Nana's products!<br /><br />Instead, I suggest you buy something like Pamela's chunky chocolate cookies. They are one of my favorites.

review/summary: Puttin' on the Ritz--with an awesome healthy glow !!!
review/text: Reduced fat Ritz crackers by Nabisco have been one of my favorites for the last couple of years when I sometimes need to switch to a less fatty diet to keep myself as healthy as possible. These crackers have also stood the test of time because they are very tasty and great to eat as a snack.<br /><br />Reduced fat Ritz crackers are very low in fat (roughly 2 grams of fat per serving) and they have almost no carbohydrates. They are cholesterol free as well--hooray! In addition, this product is kosher if that matters to you. The nutrition label indicates that there are no trans-fats but I did notice a bit of partially hydrogenated ingredients on the label--it may be that the amount of trans-fats this generates is negligible.<br /><br />These wonderful crackers can be eaten by themselves but feel free to get creative! They can help out when it's time to make snacks for company. They go great with a little bit of dietetic butter on them, too.<br /><br />Overall, reduced fat Ritz crackers really hit the spot when I crave a snack before bedtime and yet I must diet. I simply take a slice of two of dietetic cheese or dietetic butter and place little bits of that cheese or butter on top of the crackers--with a small beverage it's awesome!<br /><br />I highly recommend reduced fat Ritz crackers as one of the healthier crackers that will satisfy you, too. Great!

review/summary: Hot Cajun Jerky - Spicy but doesn't burn
review/text: I ordered the Wild Hare Hot Cajun Beef Jerky as part of the Add-on program in Amazon Grocery. It kept popping up when I ordered my K-Cups (does coffee go with jerky?) so I finally caved in and ordered some because my family loves jerky. All three jerkys had a very hand-crafted look and flavor, so it was a nice variation from our usual tried-and-true grocery store jerky.<br /><br />Size: I ordered the 3 oz package which came with 10 triangle and square shaped jerky pieces - not the long strips like we usually get<br /><br />Texture: Thinly sliced which makes it easier to bite and chew, cut cross grain so you can shred it apart<br /><br />Flavor: It has a subtle cajun flavor which builds as you're chewing on it, but doesn't leave you gasping for water. If you're looking for something REALLY hot and spicy, this may not be for you. But I liked the well balanced amount of heat and prefer that to getting my mouth burned.<br /><br />Value: I paid $7.03 for the 3oz package which allowed me to try the other 3 flavors as well. My family and I liked all three - the teriyaki was my favorite - my kids and husband liked the Original Beef and Hot Cajun.<br /><br />We'll definitely try them again along with the beef sticks.

review/summary: Kitty Crack
review/text: We call this kitty crack because we can literally get our cats to do anything for it. If they won't come in at night, we shake the bottle and they come running. They jump up on the chair and sit up for a small piece. It is nice to have some kind of control over this uncontrollable species!

review/summary: "Most Excellent" Treats!
review/text: These treats, which are pieces of pure freeze dried-chicken, are pure chicken and as such<br /><br />are absolutely captivating to both my dog and cat, who will sit politely drooling, side by side, waiting for their treats, much to the amusement of friends and family.<br /><br />They are, however, fairly expensive.  The fact that I can buy them for a much more reasonable price through Amazon.com makes my faithful animal companions very happy, makes me look like a sport and keeps me out of the poorhouse.

review/summary: Our Cat's Favorite Treat
review/text: We always take our family cat for at least one or two 30 minute breaks outside each day. It gives her something exciting to do after being cooped up inside the house. When our cat gets in a naughty, bad, or rebellious mood and won't come in the house, guess what brings her in? Yep, Halo Liv-a-Littles Natural Treats for Cats Chicken Breast Protein treats. She immediately runs to me when she sees the bag and jumps on the table and gobbles up each piece like a vacuum cleaner. And that's saying a lot, because our cat's very picky when it comes to food. If you have a picky cat, I highly recommend these treats for your cat. These treats will make your cat happy.

review/summary: Has Sodium Phosphate in it
review/text: Sodium phosphate is a preservative.  So these are not chemical and preservative free.  That's the part I read, but I should have read more carefully.  I didn't realize it was in there when I ordered these for my cats.  One cat ignores them, but my other one loves them.  But sodium phosphate causes me terrible migraines so I stay away from it in my foods and medicines.  Even a little bit has a bad effect on me.  This makes me very wary about giving it to my cat.  The salmon has no marinade and therefore no sodium phosphate, so I'll get that one again.  I wish the chicken was more pure.  I don't do many reviews but I thought I should point this out in case it makes a difference to anyone else. I'm always looking for healthy food for my cats and dog.  Not sure this is, with that chemical in it.

review/text: We ordered these recently because we used to get them at Whole Foods in Louisville or at Krogers.  But there is no Whole Foods where we live now and Krogers runs out for long periods.  Our cats love them.  One of the cats eats these treats about 90% of the time.  They're expensive but he's just so healthy and playful. (We break them up a little smaller)<br /><br />They came in just a couple of days, too.  Great service and packaged up nicely.<br /><br />Update--The first few times the product came in 2-3 days.  This time I ordered it June 26th thinking it would come by the following Tuesday but it's now July 6th and they are giving me a goal date of July 8th. To me, this is just too long. I've ordered things from East Coast before with standard shipping and gotten them in 3 days, so I don't know why it has to be 11-12 days for this.<br /><br />Barbara, Larry, and Cats

review/text: I'm not quite sure why this product listing is for the chicken variety yet in the product description it speaks of how the beef version is made. That's a little confusing and makes me wonder about the chicken version...which is what I'm here to review. Trust me, the chicken variety is where it's at!<br /><br />This potent, endlessly pleasing box of feline ambrosia is the closest thing to opium I could imagine rewarding my cats with, without travelling over to the Middle East to get the real deal. Be warned: your kitty will take to this treat like the most ravenous furry addict you have ever seen, never missing an opportunity to spy on you as you open the refrigerator to once in a while (when you're not spending inordinate amounts of time with your cat) get sustenance for yourself. If you've never wondered what it is like to marvel at a cat trying to open a refrigerator door, don't buy this stuff. Don't even think of returning to simple store-bought crunchy treats after this stuff. Your cat will look at you like you are trying to replace sushi with a gold fish cracker! "C'mon, human, give me the goods; give me the white lines, I mean CRUMBS!"<br /><br />If you drop a little piece on the floor, your animals will race to lap it up and transport themselves into "Blissful." It is the ultimate reward with very few negative side effects as far as I can tell (other than unbridled, but functional addiction!)<br /><br />This stuff is a magical, mysterious little concoction that puts an instant smile on your feline and makes her your friend for life. It will slowly start wrecking your monthly budget, of course, but you will find justification after justification for purchasing it ad infinitum.<br /><br />I believe that William S. Burroughs, in the seminal novel Naked Lunch, spoke of the "algebra of need." As soon as your fluffy little angel hits this chicken-laced pleasure pipe, she'll be hooked for life!

review/summary: Kitties FLIP for these!
review/text: Our cat Max has a morning routine.  He goes into the kitchen and stands by the counter where these chicken treats are kept, and stares up at it until one of us gives him some.  Then he dances around while he devours the morsels.  If we don't come into the kitchen quick enough, say on a weekend, he'll come and find us and meow unitl we stand up, walk into the other room with him, and give him some.<br /><br />My wife and I have no idea why this is so addictive.  It has no particular smell, no special ingredients that we can figure.  My wife even tasted one of them, and found it to be very bland.<br /><br />But the kitsers LOVE it!  Dunno why, but we keep it handy.  And by the way, other flavors don't seem to have the same addictive appeal.  Only the chicken.<br /><br />We have a lot of fun giving them to our cat, and you probably will too.

review/summary: My cats LOVE these!
review/text: I don't normally bother to write reviews, but I had to put in a plug for these.  We adopted a mother cat and two 5 week old kittens a few weeks ago.  The mom had been a stray and is really skinny, so we wanted to get her to eat something extra.  We went to a cat show and one of the participants was feeding these to her cat as a treat.  She said all cats love them so I ordered a jar.  The mom and the kittens all love them.  The only problem is that we keep them in the refrigerator and every time we open the door the mom cat comes running hoping for one and the kittens soon follow if they are awake.

review/text: I first learned about this product a year ago, and I've been giving it to my cats ever since. They get it once a day as a treat, and they love it. If there is a flavor of food that they may not be too crazy about, and I have nothing better to give them at a moment, then this will do the trick. I sprinkle it on top and they will eat it all no matter what. Also, when I clip their nails they get it for putting up with it, as well as if there is some special occassion. In overall, this is the best treat that I've ran accross, safe, apparently tasty, and one box can last me over a month, for two cats. I wish I could find it in local pet food stores.

review/summary: The perfect cat treat
review/text: I had not been buying treats at the store for my cat because the ingredients lists are full of things that are bad for her.  For Christmas she got some freeze dried salmon treats and she liked them but then she broke out like she always does when she has seafood.  So I came to Amazon to find a similar treat that was not made of fish.  These chicken treats are just right.  I do have to break most of them in half for her, otherwise it seems she can't get a hold on them.  But they are easy to break, airy and light, not dense and hard.  It's nice to have treats in the cupboard for her again, the giving of a treat now and then is highly pleasurable.  Update - I can not open "the" cupboard door or even a Gladware container now without Miss Kiki rushing into the kitchen hoping for some of these treats.  The only downside to them is the cost.  Maybe Amazon will add them to the Subscribe and Save program, that would help.

review/summary: My cats go nuts for these treats
review/text: My cats are giving this one an all-paws-up, quite literally. The Liv-a-Littles freeze-dried chicken pieces are the only treats that they will stand on their back legs for and beg. One of my cats thinks it's not really worth THAT much attention and begs in a bit more restrained fashion, but the others positively go nuts for this. Even my most picky and skittish treat-refusing kitty will take these eagerly and come back for more and doesn't even mind getting petted if there's a piece of freeze-dried chicken to have in return. That makes rattling this box of treats the best tool to "call" them when the times comes to go to the vet etc.<br /><br />One word of caution though: These are very rich and essentially concentrated dehydrated protein (80%). They really are meant to be an occasional treat only. I have to be careful to feed just a few pieces at a time and usually just give my cats 2-3 small pieces each and then put the box safely away again. If I offer more, they will eagerly overeat and at least one of my cats will eventually throw it all up again once it rehydrates in his stomach. Also, if you keep the box in an accessible place, they may try to break into it.

review/text: I buy these on a regular basis for my 22 year old cat. He loves them. They are kind of expensive, but he is worth it. And he does not get them all the time, but when we go to bed. My dogs love them as well, but they don't get them as often. They are freeze dried chicken (I have tried the other ones:beef, liver: cod, with less good results). Every once in awhile one of the treats is a bit hard, and those I give to the dogs. Some containers have more hard treats than others (about every fourth in some), but most are pretty good. I have also tried other brands and they are not as well liked by my cat as Halo. When the container gets low, I sometimes sprinkle the crumbs on his food. He loves it.<br /><br />I bought them from this seller because I was running low. I typically buy them at Whole Foods Market in Texas, but have been out of state a bit and needed some. I tried this seller and they were very quick and the treats were about the same price at the ones at WFM. My cat is happy. When he is happy, I am happy.

review/text: Yes, these are expensive cat treats but Amazon is the best value and I think they're worth it.  My cat has had some digestive issues and these treats are very high quality.  I did buy the salmon and beef varieties also but these are the only ones she eats.  We will keep buying as they do last quite awhile.

review/summary: My cat goes nuts
review/text: Man, my cat loves these treats. As soon as he gets eats a piece, he looks around frantically for another.<br /><br />I've tried out these treats on three other cats. One didn't know it was food, but the other two went frantic over the treats also.<br /><br />One note though, this is the first time I've used them and just now, probably 3 weeks after I've opened the package, I saw the "Must refrigerate after opening". I feel bad giving my cat what might have become spoiled treats, but he never cared. I threw out what little I had left and am buying more.

review/summary: Cat loves it, but it is fragile for shipping
review/text: My cat flipped out the first time I fed him the treat.  He acted like it was miracle from the heavens and was so excited.  They seem to be good quality and tasty.  The only issue is the fact that it is freeze dried means it doesn't ship well.  There are a few big pieces but a lot of the pieces have been smashed to dust.  I am not sure if there is a way around this, but it is sad to throw away the dust at the bottom which I am sure is equal to a few treats.

review/summary: Still great after many years
review/text: I've been feeding Halo freeze dried chicken treats since 2002. I won't give them anything else because these are simply the best. All I have to do is call out "treat" and they all come running because they know they will get these. This packaging is new but I like the new package because it no longer takes up as much space as the cartons did and also that I can squeeze all the air out. The treat itself is still the same as it's always been and I've never had an issue with quality control.

review/summary: My cat would walk over hot coals for these!
review/text: My cat, Gigi, would walk over hot coals to get to "liv-a-littles".  She loves her other treats....but these are a special thing.  Although she is 10 years old, she does amazing tricks for liv-a-littles.  (She even asks for them by name!  In cat speak...."mmr-a-mmmrr".  She now does about 6 tricks, including jumping through hoops, rolling over coming back to a sit, blah blah blah....video to come on youtube soon.  Search for "Gigi" .  In the meantime...get your cat's these treats!  My cat goes INSANE for them!!!  Worth every penny!  I used to buy them at Petco, but they stopped carrying them.  Amazon has a great price.  Trust me.  If you want a bond with your cat (tricks or no tricks)...get them these liv-a-littles.  You will be amazed!  And they will be soooooooo happy!!!!  (Plus, they are all protein and incredibly healthy!)

review/summary: Great treat for diabetic pets
review/text: Bought these treats for my diabetic cat, as he can't have any treats with "stuff" added to them. These are completly natural and high in protein. They do have sodium added however, so I use them sparingly. My cat inhales them!!! The chunks are a little too big for a cat's mouth, but very easy to break into smaller pieces. Overall, great natural treat.

review/text: These treats are great! Both my dog and cat love them. When they hear my shake the container they both come running. It's the only time they will willingly sit next to each other and not fight. I'm very happy to have a treat I can feed both my cat and dog. Totally worth buying even though the price is high for the amount of treats you get in each container.

review/summary: Great healthy and delicious treat
review/text: Who'd have thought plain freeze-dried chicken would be so irresistible to cats? I also call this stuff 'Kitty Krack' - all my six cats love it.<br /><br />The healthful part is also a very big concern for me since one of my cats is diabetic. Halo's is one of the very few treats around that's low carb enough that I can give them as a reward for him cooperating with blood testing. It works great. The diabetic guy heads right to his testing spot on the sofa as soon as I get the jar of Liv-a-Littles out of the fridge and give it a shake. The other kitties follow us and wait for their share of the treat action.<br /><br />It's not cheap, but I give them each a small chunk and a little extra for the one getting blood-tested, and a jar usually lasts for five days or so. Well worth it.

review/summary: HER FAVORITE HIGH QUALITY TREAT!! AND SHE'S TRIED THEM ALL
review/text: Wow this stuff is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G...my dog is on the ground trying to find CRUMBS of this stuff from our last training session. I know its a HIGH HIGH PRICE compared to other traditional items for what seems like a small canister of it, but really its worth it. Its healthy. And really two regular sized chunks of this (maybe theres 30 chunks in the jar), anyways just a few chunks broken up are perfect for a training session for a puppy. One chunk is about an inch to an inch and a half and I break it up between 3 and 4 pieces...today is the first day she's tried it. It's cheaper to get it in the store (petco) if you're getting just one jar (due to the shipping you will have to pay)...however if you and your dog like the stuff it's worth spending a hundred on the larger quantity, and then breaking it down you're only paying $8.00 a jar (and thats including shipping) when you order up. ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW WOW WOW... and after she stopped looking for crumbs, she did a little cute wimper wanting more, and then came over to me a few minutes later (As I was typing this review) and came over to do some more 'playing'...hehe I petted her and left her alone for a bit now she's chewing on a rib bone from last night. Anyways this stuff is amazing!! You should try it...<br /><br />Sandra and Lilly [the dog =]

review/summary: Halo Liv-a-Little Chicken Cat Treats
review/text: This is an outstanding product.<br />I have 2 cats, and I am very conscious about what I feed them. They are like my children, and I only want to feed them the best. I heard about Ellen DeGeneres' company, Halo, and their products for pets. I respect Ellen and her deep love of animals. The treats are all natural, just freeze dried pure white chicken meat. I bought them, and gave each of my cats a small piece, and WOW, you would have thought it was catnip. They both started purring and rubbing up against me for more.<br />Now, it is a nightly treat. At around 9:30, they both let me know they want their chicken, and I feel happy knowing I'm giving them something safe, and healthy.<br />I will admit that they are expensive. It is not a very big jar, but I break apart the large pieces, and give them each 2 small treat size pieces a night, so the jar lasts a long time. Once you open them, they do have to be stored in the refidge. The only problem that I have is that everytime I open my refidge, one of my cats tries to con me into giving her an extra treat. This rarely happens, but you have to be careful not to shut the door on a tail.<br />I have recommended this product to several friends, all of whom have had the same result with their cats.<br />*****

review/summary: Pavlovian Response
review/text: If you expect to ever open the freezer in our house without being surrounded by five sharks, er, cats, you have another think coming. The freezer is where we keep these treats and their dry food (to kill storage mites, which will infest even airtight containers at room temperature or the fridge. The freezer will kill them), and any time the door is opened I am swarmed by kitties you'd think haven't eaten in a week. T turns into "Godzilla Cat," an 11-pound sleek black DSH with round, golden eyes who loses his mind at the mere mention of these treats. Noisily demanding satisfaction, it is a task to distribute the Liv-A-Littles to the maddening crowd with any degree of fairness. They are also extremely useful to use as a reward when administering medicine. I pretty much have no problem giving any medication that I've previously tried (and failed) with Pill Pockets. Happy cats = happy people  >^..^&lt;

review/text: Halo makes great products, my cats love them.  They especially love the Liv-a-Littles White Meat Chicken Protein Treats.  The only issue I have is that lately they seem to contain more pieces that are so hard I can't even break them apart.  Obviously, if I can't break them, my 6 month old kittens don't stand a chance.  I keep buying them because they are superior to everything else on the market (in my opinion), but given the cost, it does get a bit pricey.

review/summary: One of the best treats!
review/text: My cats go nuts for these treats.  They are soft enough to break into smaller pieces for piggy kitties that don't chew.  They would also be good for a cat (or dog) who is sick and not doing so well eating.  You could crumble them up on top of some food, or maybe coax them into eating a few plain.  They are basically pure protein, which is fantastic since most house cats tend to be a bit portly, my two included. And as we all know, protein is one of the main nutrients, especially for cats.  These are my cats second fav, but it's a very close race.  I've got my friends' cats all hooked too!  Even the super finicky ones!

review/summary: Crazy for Chicken Treats
review/text: My cat is not what I'd consider a treat cat.  You cannot bribe her with food and she's rather picky.  So when my friends gave my cat these chicken treats for Christmas, I was a bit skeptical.<br /><br />To my surprise and utter disbelief, she goes crazy for these treats! I ordered them online and had to wait four-weeks since they were on backorder.  Maybe all kitties are liking this treat!<br /><br />The backorder issue is my reason for four stars...Otherwise, I'd give it five stars.  In my panic to find more treats in the interim, I found that Whole Foods carries it for ~$10/container.

review/text: This is a fabulous treat with no nasty carbohydrates or preservatives.  My cats absolutely love them and have eaten them since kittenhood.  We use Halo as a reward at medication time, and to tempt cats who are feeling under the weather.  A little "chicken dust" on their food, and the appetite is back.  For ill or elderly cats, this product is a must-have.  I do wish the chicken was organic, and I would be willing to pay a little more for that benefit.  Yes, these are expensive, but a little goes a long way.  We just don't feed the regular grocery store junk any more.

review/text: Both cats love Halo's Liv a Littles Freeze Dried Chicken Breast. My youngest cat wanted nothing to do with these treats for a long time then one day changed her mind and now is the biggest fan in the house. I haven't tried the Beef or Salmon. Chicken is king around here.<br /><br />I reserve these for once in a while treats or to entice eating by sprinkling it atop newly introduced wet/raw foods. The Halo website says the chicken is made in a marinade broth of sodium phosphate, salt, and carrageenan before it's freeze dried. I trust Halo's practices but do wonder how much salt is used in the process and wish the amount was on the label.<br /><br />I also have a tube of Thrive Freeze Dried Chicken from a UK company that has been very popular at holistic pet retailers lately. Their claim is that it's 100% freeze dried chicken and nothing else. I can't garner any more information than that from the tube or the manufacturer website, but my cats go nuts for Thrive just like they do Halo.<br /><br />These are expensive little treats but the cool thing about them is they can be served as solid chunks or broken into dust like particles, or wet by adding a little water. I have to think that with so many cats out there who have lost teeth, this is probably a superior treat to have once in awhile.

review/summary: "You Complete Me"
review/text: A brief glimpse into the world of Cinnamon, the Chihuahua Princess of Midtown Manhattan:<br /><br />"My Daddy not only does all the typing for me (I'm preserving a manicure, naturally), he also caters to my desire for home-cooked meals. I know, I know: whatever complaints may thus ensue about me being spoiled and finicky are completely his fault, but Daddy knew that when he decided that both nutritionally and economically (not to mention emotionally) this worked out best for both of us.<br /><br />That said, I've lately become a bit fussy -- even when it comes to really, really good meals like freshly cooked pork or beef or chicken with the vegetables that Dad insists I eat. You might understand if I were to turn my cute little nose up at, say, Alpo... or even Grade-B ground beef; but I'm summarily rejecting the good stuff that my old man tastes and actually enjoys as he's preparing it for me. I think it's a phase, because I feel just fine, but I'm trying this whole new "I am not amused or pleased" routine to see how far it'll get me with him. I'm holding out for a mink hoodie and a pony to ride in the country this summer."<br /><br />OK, now on to Dad's own story:<br /><br />"I saw these on Amazon as I was searching for the desiccated beef treats my girl likes. These were about a third the price and one of the few brands in the price range that was actually just MEAT and not some sort of dehydrated hodgepodge of gunk.<br /><br />I figured I'd give them a shot. I opened the container when they were delivered, and tasted it myself after reading the ingredients (which are "chicken" and "marinade", basically). Dried chicken. What's not to approve?<br /><br />The princess was given a piece. She turned her nose up at it and returned to her faux-nap.<br /><br />But as soon as I'd turned my back I heard the chewing and within moments she was at my feet looking for more.<br /><br />I was still waiting for her to eat the plate of delicious food I'd slaved over an hour or so earlier, so I wasn't giving in. Test complete. Treats would be saved for a time when they were actually deserved.<br /><br />And then I read the label as I pretended not to notice her neediness. "...as a tasty incentive at mealtime."<br /><br />Hmm...<br /><br />I took out another chunk, crumbled it on her food, and watched as she sniffed, licked, walked away, reconsidered, and returned to the scene of what she HAD considered my culinary crime.<br /><br />Incentive indeed. Her plate was clean about two minutes later. She was fed, I was vilified, and these chicken treats elevated in both our opinions to the level of 'Heroic.'"<br /><br />From both Cinnamon and Daddy;<br /><br />"Thank You, Halo Liv-A-Littles."

review/summary: DON'T ORDER!!
review/text: I have returned this! There are some hard pieces that will not allow me to crumble to put on pets' food so they had to be thrown out. What are they? Wood? Not acceptable! Returned and will not order again!!

review/summary: May have made our kitty sick
review/text: We try to feed our cats wholesome healthy foods, so we thought these treats would be a great alternative to the kitty junk food they had been eating.<br /><br />Our 12yo girl cat sniffed these and turned up her nose. She is superrrrr picky, and lots of times will not consume something the first time you offer it to her, so no biggie.<br /><br />Our 2yo boy cat, as other reviewers described, went nuts. We gave him a few small bits (maybe the equivalent of 3 regular cat treats in size) and were delighted that we had found a treat he enjoys (he does not like the treats typically found in supermarkets and such).<br /><br />About 24 hours later around 11pm we noticed he was straining to urinate, unproductive, and jumped in and out of the boxes about 15 times in 30minutes, growling and hissing at the box, and hissing at us when we tried to pet him or pick him up. He urinated on our bed, on his bed, on his pillow, and on the couch. This cat never urinated outside the box before (except during car rides in his carrier) and had never hissed before (even at his evil, manipulative, bullying "older sister" cat that loves him dearly).<br /><br />We called the vet, who squeezes him in first thing in the morning, he had a uti. Several hundred dollars in medicine, overnight hospitalization, and aftercare, he is better.<br /><br />The only thing we changed in his diet (or, for that matter, in his life) in the two months leading up to his illness were these treats. After the vet told us UTIs were usually related to diet, we threw these out. We will probably never know exactly what caused his illness, but we have a sneaking suspicion...

review/summary: Wicked little cakes
review/text: These are the best little 4 oz. cakes.  If you like a little liquor in your cakes, you'll love these.  The chocolate ones are especially good.  And they are even a little better than Tortuga Rum cakes.

review/summary: Very poor tea
review/text: I bought 3 bags of this tea and found each to be just as bad as the last.  This tea has a very weak/poor flavour.  I tried to brew it very stong but it still ends up tasting bad.

review/summary: Smokey tea!
review/text: As others have said, "if you like your tea to taste like the smell of a campfire", then this would be the tea for you.  I personally don't like it, but my friend loves it.  He calls it "smokey tea" instead of it's real name.<br />It's one of those things that you either will love it or hate it, there's no in between.  If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of "softens" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!

review/summary: Stash Darjeeling Tea
review/text: I was disappointed with this tea.  The taste was no better than Liptons Yellow Label Tea.  I expected more from a Stash loose tea since I have had good expereience with some of their tea bags.
