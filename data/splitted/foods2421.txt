review/text: Love this brand of extra virgin olive oil. I always found a distate for olive oil bought in the grocery store. But someone gave me a gift basket when my Mom died 3 years ago that had a wide variety of really nice food products. One of the items was a bottle of Aria Extra Virgin Olive oil.  Of course, I did not want anything to go to waste, but I did hesitate about using it because I was not a normal olive oil user.  But one day, I decided it was time and used this product for the first time.  OMG.. I loved it!!!  I use it for all occasions when cooking....and have never been disappointed. I always keep an extra bottle on hand, so as to not never be without it.

review/summary: A Delicate, Sweet Taste
review/text: I first had these delightful candies in Japanese class. The first thing I noticed were the wrappers, which come in three different colors (yellow, blue, and pink) and have beautiful, realistic flowers printed on them. The flower names are also given in Japanese, a bonus if you can read it.<br /><br />The package says (also in Japanese) that these are "milk plum" candies, and indeed, they do have a plummy taste. They're sweet, but they have a delicate taste that's kind of hard to describe. It's almost flowery.<br /><br />These little plum candies are tasty and attractive- perfect for your candy dish!

review/summary: Plain ol' hard candy
review/text: I'm not a huge fan of hard candy, but when I saw how cute the packaging was for these candies, I couldn't resist. The wrappers come in pearly pastel colors with different flowers on them. Even though the wrappers are different, the flavor is the same for each candy. It's somewhere in the realm between plum and peach, and isn't very strong. I didn't really want anymore after I had the first one.

review/text: Since personally I cannot read what this package really says, I was curious to try them. I had received a couple of these at work and was curious if they tasted like flowers or not, so I ordered my own bag, well when I got my bag of candy, I popped one in my mouth, the taste is very good, candy is shaped like a flower, so I'm guessing that is where the flower part comes into play. Flower tasting or not, very satisfied with this candy!

review/summary: This week on Intervention:
review/text: My wife Maki and I recently vacationed in Salt Lake City and found there a small Japanese grocery store.  While perusing, we loaded up on candies and snacks for the long drive back to Montana the following day.  Included in our cache: seven bags of Flowers Kiss candies.<br /><br />"Seven," I said.  "Do we really need this many?"<br />"Yes," she growled.  "And if they had more I'd buy them too.  Hand me your wallet."<br /><br />My wife, recently yoked from Japan and transplanted into the States under the muse of our civil union, had apparently been hiding from me a desire for the Flower's Kiss that rivaled anything she could have ever found in We.  Dumbfounded, I followed her to the cash register line and watched helplessly as she rapidly devolved from the soft spoken girl of my dreams into a rattled and aggressive junkie.<br /><br />She didn't wait to leave the building before violently opening one of the bags and candy flew everywhere.  There was a small eatery in the store full of what could previously be described as aloof Asians that were now ogling us from their chairs.  I looked down and my wife of one wonderful year was on her hands and knees cramming the candies into her mouth, wrappers on.  She was cursing and cackling and when the horrified business owner reached for his phone, I pulled her up off the floor, pushed her out the door, and then stuffed her into our car.  Restrained by the seat belt, she eventually crashed an hour later.  Her slackened, sticky lips moved wordlessly as she slid from consciousness and I could do nothing except punch the steering wheel.<br /><br />What was happening to her?<br /><br />In Japan they call it, "kisu" for kissing but when it shows up in the U.S., and it will, we'll call it an epidemic.  While she was passed out, I took the remaining bags and threw them away save one which I stored under the spare tire in our trunk.  I had the house to myself later that week, (she was still in hospital), and that's when I blasted off.<br /><br />The write up here on Amazon would have you believe that the flavor profile is of the apricot-plum variety but I will not stand behind that description.  They instead and more accurately taste of milky peach and are absolutely delicious.  Roughly the diameter of a quarter and maybe half of an inch thick, they're mostly smooth discs topped with a knobby exterior that creates a sort of grip for your tongue that I found completely necessary.<br /><br />When I took the candy, my glands responded immediately.  The combination of delightfully balanced sweetness with the sudden eruption of saliva orchestrated in my mouth a vibrant sensation of such overwhelming sensitivity that it dumped me on my rear where I wept openly for the first time in years.  How could I have ever condemned her for this?  She was strapped down in a hospital bed sad and misunderstood while I got my kicks from the very substance that put her there.  And I felt rotten about it.<br /><br />"Flower's Kiss candies aren't BAD," I said to the nodding glitter wizard floating next to me.  "These are as far from bad as good has ever been.  My god, man, what have I done and why isn't she here doing this with me?  Maki comes home NOW."<br /><br />I stood to grab my car keys and that's the last thing I remember.  The next morning I woke up in the bath wearing only a memory foam cuirass and a set of besagews made of alarmingly moist cod pieces.  Bare from the waist down, my legs and groin were covered with cigarette burns and the glued on tufts of hair I'd apparently shaved off of a yak that was drinking quietly from a toilet full of what I thought was blood but ended up being melted Otter Pops.  Things couldn't have been worse.  I'd hit bottom.<br /><br />Thus, here I am writing this by blowing into a computer straw because the staff here won't let me use my hands.  And I get that - when the nurses walk in too fast I think they're wendigos and I throw things.<br /><br />But I'm healing now and so is Maki.  When we finally get back on our feet we're going to sue Kasugai for manufacturing what clearly must be the most dangerous candy in the world.<br /><br />And I thank you for listening.<br /><br />- t

review/summary: A wonderful treat
review/text: As a long-time buyer of Asian candies, I love that they always seem to be sweeter and tastier(and sometimes even less fatty/sugary/etc). These candies are not an exception. I was slightly afraid of the 'plum/peach' flavor since I'm not a big fan of either, but it was lovely. I actually don't enjoy the bumpy texture, but it's no big deal- and once they turn smooth it's only bliss. If I could afford it, I'd fill my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008E072Y">Reach In Penny half gallon candy jar</a> with these and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AQWFY2">Kasugai Rich Milk Hard Candies</a>.

review/summary: Curiosity got the better of me.
review/text: I'm a chemist so I guess the test tubes caught my eye. I've been perfecting my cooking skills and figuring out what to fill my pantry with. I was prone to scoff at fancy sea salt admirers but my father did once have me taste one of his friend's salt company salt, dug up somewhere in Utah that contained lots of minerals besides sodium and it was indeed more complex and interesting than normal salt. And smoked salt? What is that?! Well, to find out, even in NYC would have involved buying lots of big bottles of the stuff, likely over time so I would lack a real sense of whether I was missing out on something special.<br /><br />That said, most of these taste about the same but may differ a bit in texture. Most are too coarse to imagine sprinkling on prepared food without grinding. The difference in coarseness makes wet finger dip comparisons imprecise. So I used a mortar to grind them for comparison. Most are not a harsh as normal table salt, but over half do translate to "just salt" after an initial second long delay as a slight mineral taste is noticed (perhaps!). I say perhaps, since no, few of the unsmoked ones taste noticeably different than normal salt. Even the pitch black unsmoked one (a great gimmick for a transparent table salt grinder at least). One tastes pleasantly "fishy".<br /><br />The smoked salts differ the most and are the most interesting by far and are quite different from each other. When ground in a mortar, you can tell it's just a surface coating, but they are much nicer than liquid smoke flavor, and the flavor survives just fine when ground. The most intense smoked one (Hickory) is now my favorite addition to bulky salad (olives, cheese, radish sprouts, sour cream, bamboo shoots, roast pepita seeds, horseradish, Worcestershire, sesame oil). It's an aftertaste, actually, that noticeably builds up, making each bite more dynamic. Their aroma is intense too and has its own dynamic. I'm delighted that I can buy hickory smoked salt in bulk now! It might be overkill for some dishes though.<br /><br />Alas, I have not in fact discovered a whole palette of flavors, just various textures and discolorations of salt, with much difficulty in figuring out which if any are favorites. Most are quite better than normal salt since for some reason when similarly ground, normal salt comes on way too fast. I can rule out about a third which translate to "just as harshly one dimensional as table salt". On scrambled eggs, it's a tough call. The serious division between "harsh" and "subtle" is stark, but I don't notice much variation of subtlety.<br /><br />Another big difference is between highly crystalline vs. "wet" samples. They may not actually be full of moisture but may just have more types of ingredients than just sodium chloride so have failed to crystallize as pure salt prior to being mined, but the "wet" ones would not work well in a table grinder at all. The bottles are labeled as to each samples uses (finishing, table, cooking).<br /><br />As a product, it would make a great gift, and in fact was packaged as a gift, with burlap sacks tied with twine. The labels are high quality bare paper. As an avid cook, I'd have been blown over had anybody given me this as a gift. I give it four stars since it did not come with what would have been most interesting off all: a brochure explaining the origin and rough mineral content of each sample. The "fishy" one has sulfur in the name, and the taste fits that description.<br /><br />Next step: after quickly discarding the obvious poseurs (merely pretty colored samples that lack any subtlety), a process of elimination! I don't intend to keep this kit, despite the social fun it might be, but to in fact toss one tube at a time until I'm down to only one or two smoked versions and only one table salt alternative, with the sulfur one needing separate consideration. I can't taste the sulfur one on eggs, for obvious reason that they are already sulfurous. It's way too hard to compare one to another, and crazy too, since A/B variations would number in the thousands, but quite easy to compare one at a time to normal salt, so that's why I'll do, to get rid of as many as possible. That last thing I'm interested in is fooling myself, so if half my salad or eggs or whatever routine meal I make doesn't taste truly superior with a given tube's contents, out it goes! I predict, after this second day of playing around that I will quickly eliminate a tube or two a day until it becomes more a consideration of texture and availability of a single normal salt alternative. I am almost completely convinced that normal salt really does pack too much punch due to lack of other ionic minerals in the product.<br /><br />My taste buds got too overwhelmed trying to solve the puzzle in one day. What fun, to do taste tests every day for days going on weeks!

This is my version of a little luxury in my life.  The local stores don't always carry the Crosse & Blackwell Orange Marmalade, my favorite of many possible choices, which has just the right amount of sweet and bitter contrast with the bright orange flavor. I don't have to break the bank to purchase the marmalade in bulk here at Amazon. If I am feeling generous, I have enough supply to gift my neighbors, who also love this marmalade, with a jar.

review/text: I've been decorating cakes for several years, and have tried many products over time. Wilton's line of icing colors are by far my favorite. They are consistent with their color labels, they don't interfere with the consistency of the icing, and best of all, so little is needed to get the right color. This is nice, because that makes them cost effective, but also you're not constantly running out or having to stock up! I use them to color fondant, batter, piping gel, easter eggs, and a lot more. I love this product and recommend it to all my friends and family.

It's all a matter of opinion, and all of these Green Mountain flavored coffees are mild with artificial flavors. It boils down to, would you rather have a blueberry muffin or french toast drenched with maple syrup with your coffee? Try 'em all, and pick your favorite is my suggestion. Also, check out the other flavors to see which is lower priced and take turns.

review/text: This has a natural flavor to it, not artificial at all, and some of the K-cups do have a serious artificial note (as does almost every flavored coffee seller). This tastes great when it's accompanying any hot blueberry breakfast- pancakes or waffles with blueberries would be nice served with this coffee, too. It's definitely a milder coffee, but it still tastes like coffee. I drink it w/ a couple teaspoons of raw sugar & a couple teaspoons of Coffeemate, and enjoy it even served alone. Not my everyday coffee, but since I love blueberry muffins, it's one I like to keep on hand. If you like flavored coffee, coffee in general & blueberries, I think you'd enjoy this.

review/text: I am a huge fan of blueberry coffee and I can never find it anywhere!  So when I came accross the k cups on Amazon I was thrilled!  It did not let me down either!  This coffee is delicious!  Fyi this coffee is a little better when you make iced coffee because it has that Sweet flavor, but I drink it both ways! :)

review/text: I was doubtful about blueberry coffee but since this flavor had such great reviews on Keurig.com, I thought I'd give it a try.  As so many other people have said, I'm glad I did!  I was afraid it would be too strong but it's a perfect blend of coffee with a blueberry aftertaste!  I have started to enjoy many of the flavored K-cups but usually in the afternoon since I like plain strong coffee in the morning- but this one goes perfectly with my yogurt and fruit!  Enjoy!

review/summary: Pleasant taste...
review/text: Just FYI - This is a light roast coffee and has a pleasant taste to it. It is perfect for a relaxing morning as it does not caffeinate your bloodstream into overdrive but just keeps you mellow and for the afternoon cup of coffee this blend would serve well also.<br /><br />There is a subtle hint of blueberry flavoring - not too overwhelming. If you have it straight up you will enjoy it without any bitter taste. You do find the flavors of the coffee to be there. But then again every one has different taste buds and what I found to be enjoyable, you may find to be a unfavorable taste; but I don't think so. I know you will enjoy this light roasted coffee as it will bring a relative calmness over your soul.<br /><br />If you add a bit of cream (my choice is french vanilla cream), it will prove as a more satisfying taste. Overall a nice cup of coffee.

review/text: I figured that blueberry would be a nice change from the "normal" flavored coffees...well, it MIGHT be, but not from the k-cup I used.<br />The smell was fine. While brewing, I thought how good it smelled, and that it might just be a nice addition to the collection of k-cups I've currently got. I took a sip, though, and found the taste to seriously be lacking. IIt had flavor, but the flavor, to me, was very artificial. Like my experience with the gingerbread flavor, this one reminded me of an air freshener or potpourri.<br />I won't buy another box of this one...

review/text: I haven't had my Keurig for long and thought this coffee sounded wonderful! It smells fantastic when it's brewing as many have mentioned. This box came the evening before I was to take off on a long car trip. Early in the morning before my departure I brewed a cup of this and took off. A few miles from the house I took my first sip and about threw the mug out the window. The aftertaste is not pleasant, it's syrupy and awful. You need a chaser to drink this coffee. Be prepared or just don't buy it in the first place! There are so many good kinds of coffee for the Keurig don't waste time on this one.

Blueberry and coffee flavors don't immediately come to mind as the most compatible combo, but believe me, they we born to blend!  I highly recommend this coffee and it is definitely one of my all time favorite coffee flavors. However, since it is a milder brew, I wouldn't recommend it being brewed in the largest size.  Enjoy!

review/text: I recently treated myself to a keurig single serve machine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System</a> and was anxious to experiment with different coffees.  I am not a fan of strong coffee so I use the travel mug size to make this blueberry coffee.  This green mountain blueberry coffee is THE best coffee ever for someone who loves the treat of a light flavored coffee and the aroma is to die for.  I am not a coffee purist and do not claim to be an expert; however I do know the difference between a good and bad cup of Joe and this gets my vote for great flavored coffee.  Please try to buy fair trade coffee - take a few minutes to read up on the subject, it is worth it!

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: I logged in to write a review for this coffee and was shocked to see how positive the reviews were, I guess my taste is not in line with the norm. I got this coffee in a sample pack and it is the only flavor that has yet to be completely used. I made one cup and it smells fantastic, it was very strange to have a fruity smell come from a cup of coffee but it really smelled great, so much so that even after I decided I didn't like it I left it on my desk for a while just for the aroma. First I tried it black, thinking it may be sweet already but it is not and it was a weird sensation to taste blueberry with the normal bitterness of coffee. Then I added sweetener which made it better, the sweetness aligned with the taste and smell of blueberry. Ultimately I just didn't like it and didn't even finish the cup. I don't think fruit flavored coffee is for me.

review/summary: You won't believe how much you like it
review/text: I got some of these cups in a sampler pack and was like, "Meh, I can use them for company."  I never have liked blueberry flavored anything (except donuts because my God I'm only human), and am not that big into fruit-flavored coffee.  So these cups sat around my house for a while.  But wow - when I finally gave these a chance, I was hooked.  The aroma is absolutely heavenly.  And the flavor is the perfect hint of blueberry, it doesn't clash with the coffee like you think it would.  Because "on paper", who would put blueberry flavor and coffee flavor together?  It is not supposed to work but magically it does.<br /><br />There's something that happens psychologically too - you feel like you've eaten a blueberry donut after you've drank the coffee.  It's satisfying like you've really indulged for breakfast but without the calories of a muffin or pastry.  (I drink it with Equal and plain or vanilla creamer.)<br /><br />I served it to my parents over Christmas - real "black coffee only" folks - and they raved over it and for the first time ever asked for a second cup.  I've been disappointed in some Green Mountain flavors, but not this one.

review/summary: Tastes Great; however...
review/text: This Blueberry coffee is AWESOME and Tastes Great in the beginning; but husband and I found that after having it so much, you begin to feel like you're just trying to get rid of it after a while. I think if we laid off of drinking it so much in the beginning, we might appreciate it more after all this time. hehe. If you haven't tried it, I do highly recommend that you do try it; just don't "overserve" yourself and get tired of it, like we did. We're going to back off and then drink some more in a few months. hehe. With that said.... the Only flavor that we have never gotten tired of is the Green Mountain Island Coconut!!! We have had the coconut just as long as the blueberry and had even more of it than the blueberry; but THAT COCONUT is the best one, by far, and I can't see us ever getting tired of it! SUPER HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ISLAND COCONUT!!!

review/summary: Smells one way, tastes another, but thankfully both are pretty good!
review/text: My boyfriend really wanted to try this blend as he has always enjoyed blueberry flavored coffees in the past.  We picked up one of the sample packs of this blend from keurig's website to give it a try.  I was skeptical about how a berry flavored coffee would translate when being brewed in the Keurig.  Fortunately, though, the end result is very good, although not at all like either of us expected.<br /><br />From the moment this coffee begins brewing, the blueberry scent is unmistakeable.  Very nice, but that had me worried that this coffee would have some sort of artificial sweetness to it.  Thankfully, however, that isn't the case.  While the scent may overpower you with the fragrance of fresh blueberries, the taste is a whole different thing altogether.  The taste of this coffee is incredibly woodsy with a bit of a hint of cinnamon (very subtle in the latter).  It's quite pleasing although totally unexpected.<br /><br />All in all my boyfriend even prefers this to the coffee shop blends, which speaks volumes in my book.  I think it's great and I'm sure we'll restock it when our current supply of pods runs out.

review/text: Tried this coffee shortly after getting my Keurig brewer.  Mainly because I hoped it would taste just like blueberries.  While of course it didn't  taste totally of blueberries, I was definitely not disappointed!  First cup I brewed, my kitchen smelled so good!!  Couldn't wait to taste it!<br />I am one who normally likes "a little coffee with my creamer".  Not with this coffee.  The blueberry taste is not overpowering but I find that I don't need to use as much creamer as with other coffees.<br />Bottom line,if you like the taste of blueberry in your coffee, you'll love it.  And have never totally disliked any Green Mountain coffee.  To me it's a a good coffee at a reasonable price.  And blueberry is THE BEST!!

review/text: I understand this is a light roast, but it honestly tastes like water. There was barely a hint of coffee flavor. It did smell pretty nice though. Sweet and fruity. I've got a bunch of cups to use up, so now I brew it and stir in some instant coffee.

review/summary: Not for long term use!
review/text: I just got a Mr Coffee Keurig type coffee machine.  My first cup, the Green Mountain wild blueberry.  I would say it's not for those who like strong strong coffee.  Tried it black just to see... eh, not so great.  Put in a splash of 2% milk and it tastes like I'm having a blueberry muffin with my coffee.  Am I in love with it, no.  Caramel and Pumpkin are my fave flavors but I do like this a lot and good to have to mix things up.  That's the point of a single serve machine, right?  For those who are bigger blueberry fans you might give it five stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: After about half the box I got bored of it.  As I am trying different flavors I don't think I will reorder this one.

review/summary: Green Mountain's Wild Mountain Blueberry Coffee
review/text: I was first hooked on Timothy's German Chocolate Cake. I received the Blueberry as a sampler.  I absolutely LOVE, LOVE THIS COFFEE!  It taste so good. It's not sweet, overpowering, just a great blend that makes you think you've just ate a fresh muffin. I really don't care to eat blueberries, but this is truly one great coffee!  I love Bold coffee, I.e., French Roast, Sumatran, Kenya. This coffee has the perfect blend.  I usually drink mine with French Vanilla Creamer.  My husband takes his black and doesn't drink flavored coffee, he did try it and was pleasantly surprised. If you like flavored coffee, give this a try, you will not be disappointed!

review/text: I'm a huge fan of flavored coffees and this one does not disappoint. Light roast that smells heavenly as it brews - just like a blueberry muffin baking - and has a great blueberry flavor that pairs perfectly with sweetener and creamer. This one is definitely a light roast but my sister (who drinks only the dark roast flavors usually) swears by it too. I have this one on constant rotation on my carousel.

review/summary: Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry,for Keurig K-Cup Brewers
review/text: Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry,for Keurig K-Cup Brewers is an excellent medium brewed coffee.  I enjoy the "Wild Mountain Blueberry" flavor that compliments a blueberry bagel or fruit with breakfast.  Unlike some flavored coffees that claim to have flavor...I have found that "Green Mountain" pulls of the balance of richness, aroma, good taste and flavor.

review/text: Tastes GREAT! But this is way too light. If you can see through your coffee, drink something else. I love this flavor but they might as well call it exlax. You need to be by a bathroom after consuming this coffee. It will destroy you. Naturally sweet. Use less than normal sweetener when you brew this.

review/summary: Love the taste, love the smell
review/text: The first thing that hits you when you brew this is the smell that closely resembles a blueberry muffin, with a ton of blueberries in it.  I am a cream user, so that sort of the dilutes the flavor a bit, it still tastes (and smells) quite good.  You can definitely make out the blueberry flavor still.  It tastes great, and has become my go-to flavor over doughnut shop and Puck's Breakfast in Bed.  This is a light roast coffee, so if you like a strong coffee flavor, you should look elsewhere.

review/text: I'm not a huge flavored coffee fan, but for some reason this one piqued my interest and I had to try it.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, it smells incredible while brewing - very fresh and strongly blueberry scented, which honestly is a tiny bit offputting at first.  But from the first sip it isn't nearly as strongly flavored, and the scent settles down quickly. I will say that the first cup carried a slight artificial flavor, but I don't notice it now that I'm used to the flavor.<br /><br />I'm left thinking perhaps coffee - with it's natural berry/fruit flavor - is the perfect foil to blueberry, something I never thought I'd say.  It just has this deep, complex fruitiness that "goes" much better than I'd have imagined.<br /><br />For the moment, anyway, this has replaced my normal breakfast blend as my go-to cup.  Another thing I *never* thought I'd say... I might have to see if this comes in decaf (ugh, decaf?) because I am drinking entirely too much!
