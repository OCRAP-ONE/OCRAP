review/summary: If you like hot chocolate you will LOVE this!
review/text: I have tried hundreds of hot chocolates from the really expensive and really cheap and this is by far the best you can ever have. It is creamy and the wonderful taste of Butterfingers. It is like a candy bar in a mug. However it is not overpowering.<br /><br />If you want to try something delicious this is perfect.

review/summary: Way over priced.
review/text: This vendor is clearly attempting to take advantage of consumers.  A 4 pack used to be sold for about $20 and has since doubled in price.  If you look elsewhere on the Interned, you can find a MUCH better price.  I just placed an order for the same product with iHerb.com.  A DOZEN 7.33 oz cans only cost me $68,97 and is being shipped 1-3 day for free.

review/summary: Sipped By a Blazing Fire..
review/text: Nestle Hot Cocoa Mix has always been a part of my family as a child and into adulthood. This stuff is chocolaty and tastes great when sipped on a cool Winter night with family and friends, next to a blazing fireplace while reminiscing about the years gone by. If only those years could be relived.. there would be time to enjoy more of this memorable drink.<br /><br />Please rate this review if you found it helpful.

review/text: YUMMY.<br /><br />I have been drinking this cocoa mix for many years.  Because it is fat free and has low sugar content, I am able to include hot chocolate in my low-calorie food plan.  Recently, I have begun mixing it with a mixture of milk and chicory coffee, to make a delicious mocha drink.  It's a lot cheaper and better than a coffee house drink!  Ordering it in bulk from Amazon.com, makes it an even better bargain.

We used to purchase it at our local stores but they only carried it seasonally and then this last year they quite carrying it altogether.  It was very disappointing.  It is a far better product than the Swiss Miss Diet Hot Chocolate.  As someone who does Weight Watchers it also works great with my diet as one beverage is no points.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product and Thank you Nestle for continuing to make it.

I think they simply tried to re-tool their formulas for some unknown reason.<br /><br />In my opinion, they should have stuck to the old adage:  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  Because they did, and none of their new products compare to this flavor--I have tried several of the competitors also--still searching!

The chocolate flavor doesn't overwhelm the taste buds. The best part is that hot water is all that's needed. One note of caution: The person making the hot chocolate must adjust the amount of mix to get good results. She didn't follow the directions on the can, but did a taste test for each batch.

review/text: I tried this flavor since Nestle appears to have stopped making my favorite, Double Chocolate Meltdown.  This flavor is not as watered down as the Rich flavor, and for that I'm glad.  However, as a dark chocolate lover and someone who enjoys a true, deep chocolate taste, I was disappointed.  This flavor is more bitter than bittersweet.  It did not satisfy my palette, and it's unlikely that I will purchase any more of the current Nestle hot chocolate flavors.

review/summary: GREAT HOT CHOCOLATE FOR THE DIET CONSCIOUS!
review/text: I love this Nestle hot chocolate but have only been able to find it in the supermarkets for about $3.69 for eight servings.  When I came across these canisters at this great price, I immediately ordered it.<br /><br />It's a satisfying hot chocolate which has only 25 calories and comes out to just pennies a serving.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.  Nice cheese flavor.
review/text: I recently tried these, after usually sticking to the Black Bean Sea Salt flavor.  These are certainly different from that flavor, but just as enjoyable.  The cheese flavoring is the perfect flavor for my pallet.  I won't switch to these from the Sea Salt ones, but will definitely add them to my chip rotation.<br /><br />Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories. That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste. To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings. I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these and wish that the bags contained less air and more chips, but otherwise I think they are great. I highly recommend that you try them.  The pricing here on Amazon, is usually about 30 cents per 6 ounce bag cheaper than what they charge at the local grocery store, HEB.  Specialty stores like Sprouts and Whole Foods charge even more for them.

review/text: I like the product, having bought it at a local store in the past.  Unfortunately package after package in my 12 pack was made up of over half the product in powder form.  It got to be a running joke in our household, to the point where I weighed the dust from 2 of the packages.  Over 2 oz. of these bags were Soy Crisp powder. I don't think it was a problem of shipping since the box wasn't dented at all and none of the bags had blown open.<br />I ended up using the dust on a salad.  The crisps themselves rock - I just wonder if Gensoy has some issues in quality control.

I prefer the minis to the regular size, they are less messy and you still get the taste of the marshmallow, cookie & flavor (chocolate, banana, vanilla).  My only complaint is that I would like to be able to choose the flavors that I want in the box.  I prefer the banana & vanilla flavors over the chocolate. The box contains 2 boxes of 12 ea chocolate & one box each of vanilla & banana.  I would have liked to choose 2 each of banana & vanilla flavors.  I will probably order it again, anyway.

I use it in corn chowder and simple pasta dishes (for example, bow-ties with butter and peas), and have used it in enchiladas. If I'm really stuck for a quick meal (because I forgot to make dinner, again), mixing it into a  packaged rice or pasta side and serving with a salad gets me off the hook--all I have to do is add the crab after the side is prepared.

review/text: I was really disappointed in this product. First of all the net weight is 4.25 oz, not 6 oz. It's about 1/3 water. Secondly the pieces are small and crumbled, without the taste or texture of crab. It could have been good quality white tuna I was eating. The taste is watery and washed out. If you're looking for succulent large pieces of crab meat this ain't it. Whatever taste is there gets lost, even in a green salad. In a crabmeat salad with mayo this would disappear all together. Might as well just use tuna already!

review/text: Although the product is convenient and the taste is good, once I was able to review the ingredients I would not have purchased this product.  The second ingredient is High Fructose Corn syrup and the more troubling third ingredient is partially hydrogenated Oil or trans fat.  All trans fat products, even products that show zero trans fat but have partially hydrogenated oil as an ingredient are products I don't purchase.  Even trace amounts cause metabolic issues.  When will food companies understand that they need to use more natural ingredients and not chemically altered ingredients?  Buyers need to help send the right message and let these products sit on the shelves.  It's voting with your dollar.  Buyer beware.

Then when my kids are suddenly starving while we're at the doctor's office or something, I can calm them down with a couple cookies.  They aren't quite as yummy when they get smashed, so try to keep them on top.<br />Homemade cookies (so long as you don't burn them) or fresh bakery cookies are better, but this is a close substitute.

review/text: I was in rush to grab something quick from the grocery on my way to work. I usually pack my lunch but somedays I simply don't have a time for it. When I first opened up the box, they were individually packed which was a plus. However, the taste? EHhh. It was so stale. Basically not palatable at all. And more to that, as I was reading the nutrition label, the second most thing that was added as its ingredients? "high fructose corn syrup". Another big thing was partially hydrogenated soybean oils. Those two must be regulated and possibly BANNED. Of course, manufacturers still use those because using partially hydrogenated oil is much cheaper than using other kinds of oils that are still avaiable out there today. Those of you who think it's not big of a deal, ok. It is your choice to put crap in your mouth to damage your body in long run, so I don't have any control over that. Quakers obviously needs to utilize better ingredients.

review/text: Price on these cookies are great.  However, the taste is average.  The cookies are individually wrapped, which is nice.  But the cookies are kinda hard and meant to be microwaved for 10 secs.  It also doesn't taste much like oatmeal, but more like ginger cookie.  The texture is also not lumpy like a homemade or high quality oatmeal cookie.  It's feels like it's made more from Oat flour and the raisins r dried and small.<br /><br />I do have issue withe ingredients, specifically, Partially Hydrogenated Oils, TBHQ, and host of other ingredients that are less than natural for high consumption.  Th<br /><br />I will not be ordering any more of these.  I expected more natural ingredients from a name like Quaker.  Partially Hydrogenated Oils are not good for heart health, and TBHQ is toxic enough that companies can only put a tiny amount as preservative.  It's also used in Chicken McNuggets that many people have problems with.  I was somewhat shocked that Quaker is using TBHQ in their food.  I haven't seen this ingredient in many foods.  Maybe other companies just aren't putting it in their ingredients list.

review/text: In my efforts to have more nutrious options for my family, I opted for Quaker Oatmeal Breakfast Cookies instead of Kelloggs Pop Tarts.<br />Both have lots of calories but at least Quaker has fiber, and I dont find the middles eaten out and the edge crusts in the trash. The fact that the ones with raisins (extra iron & fiber) makes them really good warmed in the microwave with a glass of milk after school is just a plus.

review/text: A CONVENIENT BREAKFAST ON THE FLY WITHOUT THE GUILT. THESE SOFT COOKIES COULD USE MORE RAISINS. IT IS LIKE CHEWING A TASTY DESERT AND THEN HITTING AN OASIS OF RAISIN THAT MAKES IT ALL GOOD.<br /><br />I PREFER EATING THESE COOKIES RIGHT OUT OF THE BAG AS THEY DO FALL APART WHEN HEATED FOR 10 SECONDS (MICROWAVEABLE BAG).<br /><br />THE OATMEAL RAISIN COMBINATION WORKS MUCH BETTER THAN THE OATMEAL CHOCOLATE CHIP BREAKFAST COOKIE. I WOULD SCORE THE CHOCOLATE CHIP VARIETY AT THREE STARS. SHOP WISELY, BECAUSE 36 BIG HEAVY COOKIES IS A LOT TO HAVE ON HAND IF NOBODY IN THE HOUSE IS EATING THEM.

review/summary: Cookies for Breakfast - Happy Thought Indeed!
review/text: "Cookies are done baking!" Master Chef Greene exclaimed to an entire building of sweaty cubicle dwellers.  Master Chef, exhausted and sweaty, could have saved the trouble of this baking excursion had she only known that Quaker Oatmeal Raisin Breakfast Cookies could be heated in the microwave in only 10 seconds.<br /><br />Oh the labor that could have been saved!  If only she had shredded her all-from-scratch-homemade-double-oatmeal-raisin-and-walnut-cookie-recipe from her Grandma and instead bought the overpriced oatmeal and high fructose corn syrup infused cookies from Quaker!<br /><br />The gently wafting oatmeal aroma briefly distracted my nostrils from the overpowering musk of my overworked cube mates.  As I took a bite out of Master Chef's gooey creation my taste buds savored the wholesome goodness, but my stomach instinctively craved instead  the hollow taste of processed food.  All I could think about were Quaker Oatmeal Raisin Breakfast Cookies!  (Which, by the way, is always pronounced in the plural despite the fact that there is only one cookie per package.)<br /><br />These abominable Quaker Cookies ruined me for all other cookies.  Not because they are good, oh no, but because each one tastes slightly less bad than the last, creating an ever compounding craving for junk food.  Especially junk food that claims to be healthy, such as Quaker Oatmeal Raisin Breakfast Cookies.<br /><br />May Master Chef Greene save us all.

review/summary: A MUST TRY!!
review/text: I'm an avid drinker of a famous coffee retailer, and I routinely use a creamer in its coffee to blunt the acidic aftertaste. I recently read about civet coffee and it peaked my interest. I Googled and found varying prices, and this particular seller/distributor was reasonably priced. I tried it...I loved it!! It's very smooth and no need for a creamer; just follow the directions to a tee. And don't think about what you're actually drinking... ;)

review/summary: Smooth But A Little Too Expensive For Everyday Consumption
review/text: After learning about kopi luwak from The Bucket List, I've been wanting to try some but never could bring myself to try it due to the cost and the fact that it's been in and out of an animal.  But when I found a friend who was willing to try it with me, I figured, how bad could this be?  Granted, this was an expensive experiment but it's a once thing so the $50 was well spent in that sense.<br /><br />We both like strong coffee and this was certainly strong.  A 100gm bag was more than enough for a 10-cup pot with some leftover.  It didn't smell any different nor did it taste any different, unfortunately.  (Mind you, I'm not comparing this to stuff like Folgers or Starbucks.  I'm comparing it to the Malaysian coffee I'm used to.)  It was strong but smooth - it didn't have the "rancid" taste (not sure if I'm explaining the taste correctly) that some cheaper coffee tend to have and neither did it have a charred flavor like burnt beans.  Unfortunately, it still had a hint of bitterness toward the end of the sip.  I tried it black at first to experience the taste unadulterated by anything but couldn't stand it.  (I never could drink black coffee anyway.)  A packet of sugar made it pleasant but still retain its coffee-ness.<br /><br />As an experiment, it was worth it, albeit a little expensive.  I don't think I'll be purchasing more of this - it's an ok coffee.  I would drink it if presented with it but I won't go out of my way to get it.  Just a little too expensive for everyday drinking.  I'll stick to my Malaysian coffee - sweet, smooth, and buttery, almost.

review/summary: Amazing Customer Service!
review/text: I couldn't be happier with the customer service from Luwak Star.<br /><br />I ordered a bag of Luwak Star Coffee this weekend to send as a gift for a family member, crossed my fingers, and hoped it would arrive in time despite ordering very late. Just two days later, after noticing the delivery address was different from the billing address, the owner of Luwak Star emailed to ask if the coffee was a gift. She said that if so, she would be happy to include a card in the package. I was floored. What an incredibly considerate gesture. I even told her that I had placed the order too late and was worried it wouldn't arrive in time for a birthday. She responded right away and said she would be happy to visit the post office and look into rush shipping for me.<br /><br />There are several options for purchasing quality coffee on Amazon, but this type of service is rare, worth supporting, and will keep me coming back. I'll make sure to follow up on this review once we have a chance to enjoy the coffee!

review/summary: No bitterness and goes down smooth and easy
review/text: I must confess that normally I don't like to drink coffee black but prefer it with some 1/2 & 1/2 and at least a few spoonfuls of sugar.  I find the original coffee flavor generally too bitter.  But I had heard such good things about Luwak Star with the promise that it would not taste as bitter and is easier on the stomach, so I decided to try drinking it black.  Sure enough the coffee tastes delicious with very little bitterness, and I finished it without even thinking about the usual necessities of cream and sugar.  What a treat!

Now the coffee it self i will say smelt freakin delicious and i had my girl smell it and she loved the smell also. after grinding the beans and brewing the coffee of course i tried my best to follow the instructions. the outcome of fresh brewed coffee was so far the best coffee I've tasted and i drank it black also i don't drink coffee i prefer tea. my girl is in love with coffee and even wants to marry the stuff, i'm jealous..lol other than great customer service and product arrived quick overall two thumbs up!! thanx fenche

review/summary: You have to be a coffee lover....
review/text: This product is something you have to be open minded about trying, and you must truly love coffee to appreciate it. No one I know can imagine why I decided to purchase or drink this.<br /><br />The packaging was standard USPS shipping package. Ordered May 1st and arrived May 5th, where it was estimated to arrive between the 8th and 23rd. Ships out of California, so if you live closer, it will probably be sooner.<br /><br />The package contains the whole, roasted beans, so you'll need to grind it to your desired texture. The included instructions were nice, but following them for a French press delivered a slightly weak cup. The coffee was smooth, slightly chocolatey in undertones. Debating doing an espresso brew with it.<br /><br />Overall, you can't go wrong if you purchase this. But you have to love coffee to appreciate it for what it is.

review/summary: Warning -- not safe
review/text: OK, first a review of the flavor:<br /><br />I tried it without any cream or sugar, as was suggested.  It had a pretty pleasant, mellow flavor.  It wasn't nearly as acidic as most coffees but you have to have a pretty distinguishing pallet to appreciate it.  I added cream just to test it out and indeed, it ended up tasting like normal coffee.<br /><br />I give this one star because after I drank it, I ended up running a fever of 102 degrees that lasted for a week and a half.  I finally went to the hospital and they found ileitis on a CT scan of my abdomen and confirmed it with a colonoscopy.  They found no damage consistent with an autoimmune disease, like Crohn's, and they ruled out everything except a bacterial infection.  They gave me Flagyl and my fever finally broke.  The ileum is where the bacteria from your stomach gets concentrated as the contents are processed into your small intestine, and it was consistent with an infection from a pathogenic source, at exactly the right timeframe, so it was almost certain that I got this from drinking the coffee.<br /><br />I thought after the cleaning, roasting and brewing, it would be safe, but think about it: the cleaning wouldn't be done with an antiseptic, because doing that would contaminate and ruin the beans.  Pathogens could still live within the cracks of the beans.  Roasting still doesn't eliminate the risk of cross-contamination, and when you're brewing it, as in a French press as I did, the temperature may well not be high enough (they tell you not to boil coffee as that ruins it) to kill the pathogens.  Remember that these beans passed through a creature's digestive tract and you're drinking the extract.<br /><br />I'm sure not everyone will get sick, but it is a risk.  I never thought I'd get sick, but I did.  So use caution and if you start vomiting or running a fever after you drink this, get some appropriate antibiotic from your local PCP.  As for me, I'll never drink this again.  The experience was not fun.

It tastes ok, not great, and is certainly inexpensive, and we use so much tea in our home it is a great find.  We also use a lot of other varieties, like herbal Good Earth, for cinnamony spicy, and fenugreek for anti-aging and weight loss, as well as hibiscus (I forget what that is good for), and tulsi (ditto) and others.  The teabag string is odd, you have to pull it (carefully) out.  Once you figure it out, it's pretty easy.
