review/summary: Awesome Product
review/text: This product is GREAT!!  The packages of macaroni & cheese just don't have enough cheese and I like Ziti or Rigatoni or shells better than elbow macaroni, so with this product I can put as much cheese as I want on the pasta.  I have also sprinkled it on broccoli and string beans and baked potato.  My husband tried it on broccoli the other night and loved it.  The only fault with the product is that it has a little too much sodium.  Wish Kraft had it in low sodium, but it doesn't, so I guess the optimistic side is that I get to drink water a lot!

review/text: Some time ago, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Topping disappeared from store shelves. I looked everywhere, and eventually decided that Kraft had stopped making it and stopped looking.<br /><br />I'm so excited to find it again. It's great to have around to add a cheesey taste to macaroni, potatoes, pop-corn, veggies and more. There are other brands out there, but Kraft, without a doubt is the very best.<br /><br />I'm even willing to pay the shipping charges. They're not much when you compare them to the gas I've wasted driving around searching for it!

review/summary: Misleading Picture and Description
review/text: This item sold and shipped by [...] is nothing like what is pictured, they mentioned x oz/jar, more like 5oz/can.  The first can I opened the pull tab came right off.  I'm no stranger to pull tabs I feed my cat from cans that are pull tabs.<br /><br />I recommend going to their site [...].  Their picture is more accurate of the product. The title of the site is "russian caviar since 2004, shipped from the USA".  Notice that this product title starts with "Alaskan Salmon", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of "Grained Salmon Caviar"  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see "made in USA" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was "sorry I was out of town".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.  However there are still inconsistencies with this product's page, that needs to be pointed out.

review/summary: Not exactly what I ordered...
review/text: As another reviewer has noted, the product description was a bit misleading. I thought I was getting four 7oz jars of Alaskan Salmon Roe. What I received was six small 5oz tins of something purporting to be salmon roe. Most of the writing on the label is in Russian, but it does say "Product of USA." This is all a bit off-putting, as we were planning to give the jars as gifts. Now I guess I'll have to open one one to check things out. The can has a stamp indicating that it was packed only 2 week ago.<br />If the product inside is any good, I'll upgrade this by a star (to 4), if so-so I'll leave it at 3 or maybe 2. If bad, the minimum one star.

review/summary: Buyer Beware
review/text: I absolutely love these rice snacks, and have been bringing them to work for little mid-day snacks for months now.  So when I saw these on Amazon for $12.99 for "8-Count, Pack of 4", I thought I was getting an incredible deal!  Much to my dismay, I received my package today and only received 4 bags.  I was incredibly irritated to say the least - What happened to the "8-Count"?  I paid nearly one and a half times per bag what I would pay at my local grocery store.  Not only that, when I opened a bag to see if maybe there were 8 individual smaller bags inside, there weren't.  And at least half of the little rice cakes were smashed to pieces.  I would recommend just heading down to the grocery store to pick these up and save yourself some money and frustration.

review/summary: If you love lamb you will love this glace
review/text: Lamb is one of my all time favorite meats.  At this time in my life I am more interested in the quality of my meat versus the quantity.  Instead of those huge porterhouses of my past I now relish in the delicate, complex flavor of lamb chops.  Although I am not religious I usually buy my lamb at a Halal butcher shop because I find Kosher and Halal meat to taste better.<br /><br />Whether I am serving a rack of lamb or slices from a whole leg nothing compliments the dish better than a well crafted sauce.  I own many cookbooks dedicated to the making of sauces and most recipes call for is either a reduced stock, a glace or a demi-glace.  More Than Gourmet's Glace D'agneau is a classic lamb/veal stock reduced 20 times.  The glace can be added to a stew to produce a thick, flavorful gravy or it can be used to make a lamb-flavored version of one of many classic brown sauces.<br /><br />I have used almost all of More Than Gourmet's glaces and I can't imagine cooking without them.  They are available in 16 oz. tubs or these little 1.5 oz. pucks.  Each unit comes with a sauce recipe and more are available on their website.

review/summary: Less Than Pictured
review/text: Teenie Genie is actually Eugenia species, one that even as a bonsai guy for 25 years I find difficult to keep alive. Care for bonsai trees is generally difficult enough with daily watering and continual pruning, but one that crisps at the first missed watering is one I call problematic. For anyone willing to follow the watering requirements, this may be a fine tree. I just wish it came with a stronger warning against neglect. While I usually find Brussel's to be a fine company to buy from, the pruning of my tree was considerably less refined than what was pictured. I would recommend Kingsville Boxwood over this Eugenia both for it's fine leaves and sturdier constitution, but it will likely be from a different source within Amazon.

Read the instructions, followed them but within a week the leaves turned brown and it started to die.  I let my friend who happens to be an arborist look at it and he couldn't figure out what could have happened to make it dry up and start to die, especially that fast.  Anyway, I have not given up and actually a few leaves have started to come back. Still hope it will, it really was a lovely tree.  If I could recommend on looks alone, it would have gotten 5 stars.  Someone else may have better luck.

review/text: Brussel's DT0117ALW Hawaiian Umbrella Tree in Water Pot Bonsai:  I received it as a gift from my daughter.  It was easy to set up.  The only problem was when I first placed the white stones, I put them in the water area instead of in the drain tray.  The drain tray with the white stones in it allows the water to be slowly absorbed thus protecting and prolonging the life of the tree.  I have had it for a month and it didn't loose any leaves as reported that it might.  I bought a little misting bottle for daily soft mists and monitor the tray's white stones.  If I can't see water in the stones I add a little water.  Love the plant!

review/summary: A disappointed bonsai lover
review/text: I have many bonsai trees and am a true lover of the art of bonsai.  First things first, when I ordered this tree it arrived quickly but was literally frozen.  Needless to say the tree died within 2 days of arrival since frozen roots are bad for plants.  Amazon was fairly quick in sending out a new tree and thankfully the new tree arrived UNfrozen.<br /><br />However the disappointment didn't quite end.  I'd like to point out that the second tree is completely healthy and still thriving after 3 months of my care, so kudos to shipping a healthy tree.  However, anybody with an appreciation of the art of bonsai will be very disappointed by the training this tree received.  It looks more like it was completely untrained and just allowed to grow naturally.  This is antithetical to good bonsai and leads to a pretty ugly (read: normal/average) tree.  It's just way too ORDINARY.<br /><br />Another nice note, since I hate to leave on a sour note, is the pot the tree comes in.  This is a very nice pot and would probably retail by itself for $15 or $20.  Nice quality and aesthetic that would compliment a properly trained tree if only it were..<br /><br />Cheers

review/summary: Okay plant.  Don't order in cold weather.
review/text: I ordered this plant in February as a gift.  The ups driver left it on my porch and by the time I got to it,it was dead.  Within a week every leaf fell off.<br />I contacted Amazon and was sent a replacement plant (weather was warmer when it shipped) which is very healthy.<br />The negative side is that the first plant I received had a really cool shape and had moss growing over the dirt. The moss helped the dirt stay in place on the other one... the newer one is hard to water because the dirt and stuff gets in the water tray no matter how careful you are.  The first one I received looked old in a good bonsai way.  The new one I received looks like a young tree (not 5 years at all) and has no interesting shape.  It just looks like a tree.  It is pretty and we decided to keep it because it was healthy.<br />Another con is that even though the pot is very cool looking, it has a water hole on the bottom so you need a tray or else water gets on your furniture.  By the photo I thought the water drained into the water pot... some of it does, the rest ends up on the furniture.  We went to a bonsai store and bought a tray which is black and doesn't really match.<br />My advice is go to a bonsai store and pick the one you like and works for you.  With this bonsai, it's the luck of the draw.

review/summary: omg - can this be true????
review/text: I have a small Brussels Griffon and he has had terrible skin problems for 7 of his 8 otherwise wonderful years. He has been constantly on and off prednisone, antibiotics, antihistamines, and Atopica -- they work while he is taking them but in 10-14 days he is again covered by all kinds of sores and rashes. It has been diagnosed as dermatitis which gets worse with stress. Stress is if no one is home - he is home alone at most for 2-3 hrs/day. The infections are secondary due to his immune system being compromised with the skin broken, crusted and inflamed. The itching has been at times terrible, and only prednisone or topical ointments have helped with that.<br /><br />I switched him to this Avoderm Trout food and 4 lbs later I counted just two tiny irritated areas on his skin today!! I cannot believe it - I'm in shock - how is this possible?? While taking this food he has not been medicated - except for 2-3 times a week getting a 1% cortisone skin conditioner after a short wash which he has been getting for over a year now and it has helped a little but never stopped the rashes.<br /><br />I don't know if his great skin is all due to switching to this food because I started to give him one drop of Oil of Oregano, and mixed some "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BD0RQS">Doctor's Best Curcumin C3 Complex with BioPerine (500 Mg), Capsules, 120-Count</a>" and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JNK8EY">Now Foods Quercetin with Bromelain, Veg-Capsules, 240-Count</a>in his pumpkin treats about a month before switching his food. I will now stop the herbal supplements and see if he will do this well just on this food!! I will update the review in a few months...

review/summary: Fine Chai Spice Tea---Without the Caffeine!
review/text: ****<br />This is a decaffienated version of Stash's chai spice tea, made from blended black teas, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and natural flavors of cinnamon, clove, and cardamom. Many chai spice teas (which I drink plain without milk or additional sweetener) nauseate me, but this one did not---I loved it! The numerous spices are a unique taste sensation, and enjoyable cup of tea. I brewed the tea as I always do, leaving the tea bag in far beyond the 3-5 minutes recommended brewing time, and the tea never turned bitter, just got stronger and tastier! Tastes exactly like the caffeinated version, but you can drink cup after cup because there is no caffeine!<br />****

review/summary: Better than others
review/text: I really like the Nuun tablets. They are not as sweet as others and they have a little fizz, not too much, but enough to give it a little zip and keep it from being too sweet. The orange is my favorite flavor. They dissolve easily and provide the optimum electrolytes needed to sustain me on long rides. I wil use 1 to 1.5 (they are scored and you can break them in half) in a 24 ounce water bottle and it works out great. They have recently come out with some new flazors so I will be trying more.

review/text: I had bought my first container of Dynasty Five Spices to smell. I love the aroma! Then I started using it in my marinated cucumbers 'n' onions. Well, it doesn't last forever that way. I tried another brand of five spices but it didn't even begin to compare to Dynasty. There isn't anywhere around close where I can buy it so I was glad to find it on Amazon. True, the shipping is a little steep but I pay more than the total for spices in stores. This was worth it!

review/text: I like Dynasty Chinese Five Spice as a product.  I use it in stir fry.  It is a strong flavoring that works well for me since I reduce my sodium intake. I wasn't able to find it locally when I ran out, so I decided to buy  the 6 pack choice thinking it should last for a year and a half or so.  In this case, the spices all came with a best used by 12/15/12 date.. 4 months only. I got.. old(er) spice.  Disappointing.

review/text: Wellness Core grain free is the absolute best wet food you can feed your dog. To my knowledge, it has the highest amount of protein of all canned dog food. My dogs love it, and I mean they go crazy for it and devour their dinner whenever I mix this stuff with their dry food. This product is also suitable for dogs of all life stages, including puppies, which is not the case with most canned dog food. It is expensive but worth the money. Wellness is a fantastic brand, free of by-products, bad preservatives and animal digest, which anyone in their right mind would not want to feed their dogs. A+++++

review/text: I give this food five stars because it is the best food for my Yorkshire Terrier. He was a very picky eater before I discovered this food but he's never picky with this food. I give him half a can of the small can in the morning and another half in the afternoon. Yorkies are prone to diabetes (everyone is) so to avoid his blood sugar from dropping, I feed him twice a day with a few healthy snacks in between and make sure that he gets exercise. This food is grain free so he looks lean and strong.

review/text: This is the canned food that my dog(miniature schnauzer) has eaten the longest.  I began mixing it with the Core dry food, and it did well for some months.  Gradually, she lost interest, and I had to try other flavors.  I still present it about once a week, and can get her to eat it with some persuasion.  It seems to be one of the better foods for her, but not as readily accepted.

review/text: I switched to this food when my cocker spaniel was having stomach problems and vomiting often. I found that the Nutro Ultra had gluten in it and other foods we had tried had a lot of grain. She is thriving on this food and has no problems anymore. She is a high energy 3 year old and her coat is beautiful since we switched. I do not give this food to our 10 year old cocker. I think that the protein level and calories are too much for an older dog, although your vet would be better able to help you make that choice.

review/text: I have a 3 year old that can eat pretty much anything, but I have a 15 year old that has a very sensitive system.  I was feeding them Neuman's Organic Turkey and brown rice and realized that my old guy was having issues pretty often.  So, I have been mixing this in to transition them to just this grain free food and they LOVE it and he has had no issues at all so far.  It has been well over a month, and all is swell.  I am glad I made the switch.  And ... I just remembered, the reason I bought this was because a friend's dog was staying with us and that Golden is super allergic to grains, but was not really eating her food.  I mixed in a small amount of this with her regular dry food and she gobbled it all up.  I could not have her lose weight under my care.  I told her family and I believe they bought it to mix in her food now.  I am glad we switched!

review/summary: Good for picky dogs
review/text: I've tried many different dry foods with my chihuahua mix. She does okay with them for a little while, but then won't touch them. Even when she'll eat them, she takes her time and is not enthused at all. I decided to try a canned food to see if it might be more appealing to her, and since I like Wellness I tried this first. I started by mixing it with her dry food, but she went straight for the wet food, picking around the dry. She would eat some of the dry food at the end if I stood there and watched her. I kept this up for a couple weeks, then switched her over completely to the canned food, since my cat was eating her dry leftovers. She still gobbles it down after about a month, and still licks the bowl clean every night. I was concerned about switching her over to a completely canned diet, as I've heard not feeding dry food can cause problems with the teeth and gums, but I think brushing her teeth and giving her dental treats will be sufficient. It's nice that now she eats her whole meal within a couple of minutes, so I don't have to watch the bowl and make sure the cat doesn't eat it for her. I'm sticking with the turkey recipe for now, but if she starts getting picky again, I'll try the fish recipe.

review/text: Wellness foods, in general, seem to be as fine a quality as you can give your pet short of a completely homemade diet. A grain free diet is helpful to my golden retrievers (food allergies) and Wellness Core offers several protein options in a grain free formula. I think its important to feed canned along with kibble (and some fresh veggies - usually green beans - as well). There are many fine ways to feed dogs and cats, but this works for mine. Wellness Core is a consistently excellent product and the doggies love it.

review/text: Based on the four 5 Star reviews, we purchased two tubs of these on Amazon.  While the chocolate outside is flavorful, the inside nuts are stale, and very old tasting.

review/summary: Excellent Chocolate Almonds. Strange Re-Packaging.
review/text: I enjoy having a few snacks around, but I like to have something I can nutritionally justify. Well, on my last trip to Costco, I found a three-pound (48 oz,) plastic jar of Kirkland Signature Milk Chocolate Almonds. Well, the almonds are good food and the chocolate  contains a lot of anti-oxidents, doesn't it? Hmmmm. Maybe I ought to just try one batch of these. Mmmmm. They were excellent! Nice and fresh and good tasting. Yummy! I'm going to have to watch myself and not eat too many.<br /><br />In any case, I went to review these delicious little wonders and couldn't find any listed as Kirkland Signature, but I did find these Milk Chocolate Roasted Almonds (48 oz.) and the photograph looked exactly like my Kirkland Signature ones.  In fact, if you then read down into the description, you find that they are Kirkland Signature. And if you read some of the reviews you find that they have been repackaged into a plastic bag. What goes? I have no idea. I'll rate the product as very good and give it five stars. I'll let you buyers decide on what to do.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: All of these cookies are individually wrapped, I presume to preserve freshness, which was the case, at least for the box that I tried.<br />The "surprise" was that these cookes are light and very, very good.<br />Not qualities usually associated with tasty desserts.<br />A perfect gift!

review/summary: Like Hazlenut coffee? YES!!
review/text: I recently purchased (grocery store) this brand and type of coffee, and I must say it was really delicious.  Went online to see if I could save money with Amazon.com and saw the review here that really wasn't fair to mark down to 2 stars just because they didn't like the hazlenut flavor.  I happen to love hazlenut flavor coffee and this is the best one (read 'not weak' here!) I've found so far.  Just wanted to let folks know that. Enjoy!

review/summary: Made in the US version, not the same recipe as Imported from Austrailia version
review/text: I thought, wow, bulk Lucky Country Red Licorice, sweet, but alas no, it is a mass produced Americanized version from Lucky Country's new US manufacturing plant.  The recipe is completely different from the Lucky Country Red Licorice (same brand, same name) that is Imported from Australia.  The original recipe has more real licorice despite being a red licorice, and is much softer.  The Made in US version is your typical chewy waxy candy licorice with barely a hint of licorice, just pure sweet.  Shame on Lucky Country for taking a high end sophisticated product and watering it down like every licorice sold in every drug store in the US.  I'm heading back to Target or Trader Joe's for the real thing.

review/text: I received Old Country licorice in a gift basket for Valentine's day and fell in love. I ordered it in the 4/ 1 lb. tubs shown here and received it this past week. It is not soft, in fact it is a bit on the tough side. If you are considering making an order, wait for the bags. I do not think that the tubs are airtight.

Doesnt have that platic taste like the flavored twizzlers do.<br />In fact these are a bit different than regular licorice. Theyre better. They come thicker and pretty solid they are not hollow. The texture is a cross betwen a regular licorice and a fruit snack. I love these things.

review/summary: Best Licorice Ever!
review/text: I was given a sample of this licorice from a friend who bought it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  With so many of the standard brands having little flavor, this was an immediate standout.  I have only tried the strawberry flavor, but it has a rich taste, and is a "soft" but still good and chewy licorice.  I love it.  When it wasn't available at Bed Bath, and Beyond, I found it on Amazon, and of course, it is considerably less expensive.  The only downside is that you must buy 12 6 ounce packages at once.  For me, that's not really a problem.

This candy is the best I have ever tasted, my last order was my third (3rd), it is realy good and may be habit forming to your tast buds.<br /><br />There are several items to choose from, which can be confusing. The best value is the 4-16oz tubs,4 lbs total vs the 1.5 pound package, they are both the same price. I found this to be wrong, on the part of Amazon to allow this to happen. I did not send the 1.5 lbs bag back, it wasn't worth my time, and I do like the candy...<br /><br />I live in Gainesville FL, not Zoe KY.

But, the one in Costco said "new improved recipe" perhaps this one was the old recipe. I was disapointed. But the quality of the candy was fine. Just not the same as the one I already had. So, this candy is not being eaten any nearly as fast.This candy was a brighter red color, and not as soft. However, this candy did have a stronger strawberry flavor.

When she was younger, she loved yogurt melts but now that she is a "big kid", she refuses to eat those melts because they are for babies.  Yo'Drops are crunchy, flavorful yogurt drops that feel like candy but are super healthy.  They are individually packed so I can throw a few packs in my purse when we are on the go.  I also keep a box of these in my car when my kids are are cranky and need a light, healthy snack in between meals.

review/text: The plus first.  (Notice I only have one.)<br />*These are individually packaged.<br />Great for a snack on the go, you'd think right?  Not so much.<br />Onto the drawbacks:<br />* The pieces are tiny.  I'm talking like "nerds" candy sized.  Now, my 18 month old DD is right on track with her motor skills, but she cannot manage these by herself unless we are at home and I put them in a bowl and give her a spoon.  The pack we tried to eat on the go ended up mostly all over the floor (sorry Target!).<br />*They aren't as tasty as the "baby" yogurt melts.  Now it may be that these are healthier (I did not compare labels) but my DD just doesn't get excited about them like she does the bigger yogurt melts.<br /><br />I saw a reviewer say that she gave these to her 4 year old.  I haven't given them to mine because I bought them for the baby, but I'm guessing there wouldn't be enough in one pkg. to suffice as a snack.<br /><br />I wanted to love these but I just can't!
