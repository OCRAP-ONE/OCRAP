review/summary: Very tasty, but high calorie and small size
review/text: These vanilla chip bars are very tasty and I would order them again. But. They are high sugar and, therefore, high calorie for a pretty small bar. Best for a small, sweet treat, not for a filling or "stick with you" kind of energy.

review/summary: Total Ripoff and Deceitful Product Description
review/text: The product description says a pack of six with 6 count each for a total of 36 counts.  A normal person reading this would be led to believe that they would receive six boxes of granola bars.  Not the case.  I received only one measly box of granola bars.  I was certainly not a happy customer because I paid for almost 12 dollars for one box of granola bar.  I could have gotten it much cheaper at the grocery store.  This is a the first time I experienced this from Amazon.  They should totally change the product description to 1 box of 6 granola bars instead of the misleading description.

review/summary: I am definitely buying this again
review/text: I got these to make as a surprise gift for my son.  The kit came with everything I needed including the marshmallows.  The directions were super easy, and they turned out FANTASTIC!  The jar of sprinkles they give you is huge, we still have half of them left over but BE CAREFUL WHEN OPENING IT!!! I popped the top off and tiny little sprinkle dots went all over my kitchen.  Let me tell you, those things are NOT easy to sweep up.  The only other issues I had were that there was only enough melted chocolate to make 10 pops, not 12 and I didnt realize I was going to need wax paper or a drying rack for them but that was an easy fix.  I took the box that amazon sent them to me in, flipped it upside down and covered it with aluminum foil.  Then I poked 12 holes in the box with a meat thermometer and sprayed the foil with some cooking spray so the pops wouldnt stick to it.  After coating each pop in chocolate and sprinkles I stuck the stick in one of the holes I had made in the box and it worked perfectly.  They did take about 3-4 hours to completely harden but after that I just stuck them in a ziplock baggie and stored them in my cabinet. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants to make a special treat for their loved ones, or a fun project to do with the kids.  In the store or in a bakery these puff pops cost $2 or more EACH!!!! I was amazed at the value I got with this product in comparison with similar products.  DEFINITELY add these to your cart shoppers!  You wont be sorry.

They're just sweet enough to keep them coming back for more, yet they take a little time to eat - especially using the top portion of the Zo-li snack dispenser. We put some Gerber Graduates Yogurt Melts in the mix too. Highly recommend if you'll be traveling with a little one on your lap.

review/summary: Hansen's Natural Fruit Stix Berry Flavor
review/text: In the never ending quest of not drinking soda, I've used quite a bit of water additives to make myself enjoy drinking anything other than soda more.  Some of them have been quite effective, others made me go running for the caffeine.  But this one was one of the better ones.<br /><br />Hansen's Natural Berry flavor did taste somewhat like berries.  Honestly I actually thought it tasted more like fruit punch, but it still packed some kind of fruity flavor.  It wasn't strong by any means, but sufficient for enjoying the water.  My only complaint would be that it was a little too sweet, almost cloying at times.  But it wasn't horrific, and as said before, highly drinkable.<br /><br />The ingredients are good in this drink mix.  In one little pack that's is good enough to flavor a standard sized bottle of water, there is natural colorants, stevia as the sweetener and natural flavors.  Admittedly there are a few ingredients that I can't pronounce in there, but overall it's a short list and not nearly as bad as some of the other brands are.  And the whole thing is only 5 calories with no grams of sugar.  Vitamic C is added in too and it claims that it's a 100% of the daily value, although I find myself a little skeptical at that.<br /><br />I would try Hansen's again.  There are a few better out on the market but this one isn't too bad.  And it had a decent taste, which is more than a lot of drink additives can say.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Works like a charm!
review/text: OMG, I can't believe that I didn't bite the bullet and splurge on this food sooner.  My cats have been throwing up on a daily basis for YEARS!  And I have 5 of them, so that's a lot of cleaning up to do!!!  But since I switched them to this food just a few days ago, so far NO VOMIT!!!  It is the best thing that has happened for me and my cats in a long time.  It is pricey compared to the Costco cat food that I used to feed them (which according to a lot of people in my local feral rescue group is good nutritionally even though it's cheap), but well worth the money if it keeps them healthy.  I really can't believe I didn't try it sooner, but I didn't notice much hair in the vomit until recently, so never made the connection.  Still not sure if the vomiting problem is always due to hairballs, but this seems to be working anyway.  Must be easier on their digestive tracks, and they love the stuff!  Had no problem switching them over at all.  Didn't even mix the old and new foods, just put the new food out.  Once again well worth the cost if there is any way you can afford it and have cats with sensitive stomachs like mine.

review/summary: High-quality kid-safe spray
review/text: Though I'm hesitant to call this kid-safe, since anything that scares away bugs seems that it would inherantly be dangerous to little ones, everything that I seem to find leads me to believe that it won't harm my little ones. I've used it on my kids and neither had any kind of (immediate) reaction.<br /><br />I also took this to Liberia for a three week trip. If you've ever been to a place where Malaria is common, you also know how important it is to prevent mosquito bites. I didn't have a single bite, though I have to admit, I didn't see many bugs during these particular three weeks.<br /><br />I've also used it in Washington, DC, where even 25% deet doesn't always seem to work.<br /><br />Combine it's safeness with the fact that it doesn't stink (much), nor stain clothes and this is a no-brainer purchase.<br /><br />I also took a packet of the Cutter Wipes. The packaging is a tad wasteful, which I normally try to avoid, but they also worked well, with no risk of spilling, which is always a concern with sprays.

review/text: I've used this on many trips to the Amazon jungle, and it remains on the top of my list of things to take with me.  Unlike Deet and the "natural" products, it's odorless and not greasy. That said, I always combine it with either Buzz-Off clothing (Ex Officio brand) or with clothing treated in Sawyer's clothing repellent.  With this combination I generally do not get bitten, either by mosquitoes or by biting flies and chiggers.  Since I do travel in Malaria and Dengue Fever areas, this is life-savingly important.<br /><br />It does have to be applied more frequently than DEET, but it's a lot more pleasant.<br /><br />The only caution I will give is to apply it outdoors as breathing in the spray is a bit irritating.

review/summary: picaridin rocks
review/text: OK, so picaridin is not as effective as DEET and doesn't last as long. Now that we agree on that, lets look at why I rarely use DEET anymore. DEET is oily, picaridin doesn't leave the oily slime on you. DEET smells bad, picaridin has almost no odor. DEET dissolves plastics, picaridin doesn't. DEET has some issues with toxicity/side effects, picaridin has no such problems. So, while I dread putting on DEET, I don't mind at all when I spray down with picaridin.<br /><br />This product doesn't get 5 stars because I have now found 20% picaridin which is even more effective and lasts longer. I also found it for a better price in a store, so I don't have to wait for this to arrive in the mail (it almost didn't make it in time for my fishing trip.)

review/text: I've tried many mosquito repellents over the years.  Mosquitos really like my fresh skin.  All sorts of products over the years failed, and in fact, many times I believed the repellents were actually BRINGING the nasty bugs in my direction.  Not so with any kind of Cutter mosquito repellent.  Not only does it take the itch away immediately, and not only do mosquitos avoid you the second you apply some on your skin, but the next day you might wake up to find that the bites you had from the night before have been completely healed.  No kidding.  Great, great product.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I had been using this Cutter pump spray with picaridin for years with great success, but then it became hard to find at Target, Wal-Mart, etc. I finally found an aerosol version at Target in a white container, but the aerosol version seemed to run out very quickly after just a few applications. I finally found the pump version on Amazon and ordered 4 bottles, so I got free shipping! I would estimate that I get about 10 times more applications with the pump versus the aerosol.<br /><br />This is a great product! I am outdoors a lot, and mosquitoes love me. They will ignore others standing around and swarm around me. I love the Cutter pump picaridin because it works as well as deet but is not greasy, dries quickly, and does not leave any residual odor. The key is to rub it in and be sure to cover all exposed skin.<br /><br />They say it only lasts for about 4-6 hours, but I have put it on in the early morning and have found that one application keeps the mosquitoes away from me for the whole day.

For domestic use, I'm afraid I have to switch back to a DEET-based product.  *sigh*<br /><br />(Note my sample size is 1 traveler...

review/text: My order for this never showed up, but I still have an old bottle of this, so I felt I could give a fair review.  The other reviewers are right that this repellent only last for a couple hours at best.  But when it is still fresh, it does remarkably well.  My backyard was full of mosquitos during the summer & it was hell mowing my lawn back there.  After applying a little of this, you could actually see them wanting to approach you or landing on you and they then they start flying away in disgust.  It doesn't have any offensive odors as well.  But I decided to go with another repellent that claims 6-hour coverage, but was a bit more expensive.  So, in the end, this would be an excellent product if it could last longer & was water resistant.

Deep Woods Off 25% was very effective, and next year we'll try the Avon Lady's "Skin So Soft" which is supposed to be even more effective. Maybe I'll mix up a combination of that Avon, plus some DEET 100% and REALLY get something worth putting on..

It didn't have that bug spray feel or smell either, which was very nice.  I will be using this from now on.

review/summary: Cutter Advanced is a great product
review/text: My son introduced me to Cutter Advanced with Picaridin a few years ago, and my feelings about insect repellents changed. This stuff is unscented, and has a very mild odor of its own that is innocuous.  It is also not greasy, and I don't feel the need to shower immediately after coming inside.  It works well and helps more than deet products to repel those obnoxious little gnats and no-see-ums.  It also is less toxic than deet.  When I couldn't find it in my local stores, thank goodness that, as usual, I could rely on Amazon to have it.

review/summary: Easy to apply, poor performance.
review/text: Using this product during mosquito season in Alaska resulted in roughly 3x the bites as the low percentage deet formulation it replaced in our toolbox.  It does not cut down significantly on the mosquitoes attracted as deet does, but it does appear to prevent a decent percentage of insects that alight upon your skin from actually biting.<br /><br />On windy days with light bug pressure it works quite well, but anytime the wind falls we now become a swarming mass of bugs even with heavy applications.  Probably suitable for low-pressure areas with limited bugs, we can top 1,000 bites/hour in many areas and it just doesn't cut that number down to a "sane" level even if it does block MANY if not all or most of them.  We will be looking for other deet alternatives over the next week, in the mean time we're wearing full bug netting, gloves & duct taping collars.<br /><br />Only recommended for suburban backyards with low biting insect numbers.

review/text: I visit New Zealand every year and have suffered the most vicious sandflies on earth there. I have happily used this product for over five years and consider it the best deterrent available. Much better and safer than DEET.  Unlike DEET with its all-pervading stink, this repellant has no almost no smell. I spray my hand and wipe it over my face and neck in the morning and it usually lasts all day. I also spray the backs of my hands several times daily. I have also used it against mosquitoes in various sub-tropical countries and its works there as well.

review/text: THIS Cutter Insect Repellent with Picaridin is safer and less strong odor that DEET products.  It was not on retail stores this Summer (2011)in my area of the country.  Amazon was the only place where I could find it.  If you are faced with a dense mosquito population, pour in on legs on knees & below allowing it to run into socks.  Just spraying it will often not give full saturation and bugs have a way of finding that bare spot.  DEET products are available everywhere and may last longer, but read the warnings about the risk of long term or heavy dose of  DEET.

review/summary: So-so protection
review/text: I bought this spray because it doesn't contain Deet and is in pump, not aerosol, form; however, its protection was meager.  I used it on a beach in Honduras to protect me from sand fleas.  My husband chose to use nothing.  I ended up with half the number of bites, but I still had many bites.  In even more insect-heavy areas of Central America, I had to resort to a Deet product because this Picardin-based repellent did little to discourage biting flies.  This is much better for mosquitos than for other biting insects.<br /><br />While I would use this spray in instances where the flying insects are bothersome but not relentless.  In areas where your health may depend on repelling insects, look elsewhere.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

The light syrup gives it a nice flavor. What I like most about these is the texture of the fruit retains a lot of the crunchiness of a fresh pear, while most canned pears are soft throughout. So to me, this product is something like a hybrid of fresh pears and canned pears. Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and will order again. 4 stars for the relatively expensive price, but otherwise a 5 star product.

I have had other chewy ginger candies, but adding the apple flavor made it utterly addictive! The apple flavor is not the prominent taste in the candy, it is subtle, but adds just the right touch. If you like apple pie with a little ginger in the seasoning, you will love these. Think of taking a bite of a sweet, juicy apple; and a bite of a ginger snap, and you are on the right track. It's really nice that they are individually wrapped because they can go in a purse, pocket, lunch bag, briefcase - oh, you get the idea.

But for anyone who is watching their sodium intake, has already reduced the amount of sodium they consume, and wants just a hint of salt, this hits the spot.<br /><br />With regards to burning in the microwave, my microwave has 3 popcorn settings: regular, medium, and mini bag, and this size works best on the mini setting.

The important, albeit sometimes difficult, thing to remember is not to eat too much. In moderation, they can be a very nice addition to any diet. In excess, they can make you gain weight, and the excess of oils can really take a toll on your intestinal walls. Also keep in mind that these are pretty heavily salted too.

The package is very small (about 4" X 4" X 10"), it is very lightweight since there is no can (about 11 ounces), and it shipped from the SF Bay Area, which is about 100 mi away!<br /><br />Mighty Leaf: Why do you not sell this product through Amazon the same way you sell many others, so that I could qualify for Super Saver shipping?

review/summary: a hidden treasure!
review/text: I'd had a box of this sitting in my pantry for two years, and I finally tried it last week.  I now refer to it as my 'lazy woman's risotto'.  It is effortless to prepare, and, when I leave it a little moist and lightly toss it with a little grated cheese (I prefer Cotija hard Mexican cheese), it tastes ands feels like a creamy buttery risotto (without any of the work)!  I serve it with curries and hearty tomato-based vegetable stews.

review/summary: Fast starch side dish - need more recipes!
review/text: Made this using tigerpaws suggestion from her review of this item (she called it her "lazy woman's risotto"). I toasted the cous cous with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XUM9B4">Nanak Pure Desi Ghee, Clarified Butter, 28-Ounce Jar</a> and minced garlic. Then I added two cups of chicken stock made with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016LA7K">Chicken base</a>. I didn't have cojito cheese so I used shredded parmesan, tossing it on top when the cous cous was cooked through. Whole process took about 17 minutes. Everyone in my family had seconds. I have been searching the internet looking for other ways to make it more interesting, but this is a very good pantry item for me since it goes from cupboard to plate so fast!

review/summary: Wonderful, delicous couscous
review/text: I had this wonderful couscous at an upscale restaurant and went on a search to find some for myself.  I looked in all the supermarkdets, gourmet stores etc. and could not for the life of me locate any.  I happened by chance to spot it on Amazon and ordered the whole case.  I served it with stuffed salmon and it was a huge hit.  I ended up giving some of the boxes away to friends because they liked it so much.  What makes it different from other couscous is that it is larger grained.  Very good and you can add various ingredients to it to make it even better tasting.  Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Very pleasant  Organic Earl Grey Tea
review/text: I was looking all over for an organic Earl Grey tea for a reasonable price and found that it was either ridiculous expensive or not Earl Gray which I prefer. I tried 2 other brands but didn't like the taste. I'm very pleased with this one. Smooth and pleasant flavor and even better tasting than the one I used to buy here in San Francisco in a local store (I got tired of always feeling that I paid far too much for that tea). One review complained about bitterness and I'm sensitive to that so that was a worry... but that's not the case at all for me even when making it strong... this is an excellent quality and I have had different kind of teas every morning for more than 40 years both here in the US and in Europe. Highly recommended.

review/text: The listed ingredients at Amazon are correct but incomplete. Item also contains beef base (FIRST ingredient) & MSG (THIRD ingredient), neither of which we will eat in our household. Those ingredients were omitted on the product page by accident, they say. Really?!?!?!?!<br /><br />Moreover, the package we received contained crusted seasoning on the container, and the package was dusty & yucky. I literally had to wash the canister & use a bit of elbow grease before even reading the ingredient list! This is a food item, for gosh-sakes. Should have repackaged and refused delivery right then & there.<br /><br />A bad experience with Amazon with this one, that's for certain. Would have never purchased in-store, much less handled or brought into my home. I can't believe Amazon is shipping food products in this condition. I'll definitely reconsider my purchase of grocery items here.

review/summary: One of my favorite things! DELICIOUS when it arrives unmelted
review/text: The Pacari Chocolate Covered Golden Berries are delicious!  I love goldenberries and they are typically very tart.  These goldenberries are mild in comparison.  I mainly taste the delicious dark chocolate with just a hint of tangy citrus sort of like orange dark chocolate only tangier slightly.  Would subscribe n save if Amazon offers!  Delicious!<br /><br />The golden berry is a fruit native to the Andean region. It provides a wonderful sweet-tart complement to the dark chocolate coating.<br />Ingredients: Cacao beans*, cacao butter*, evaporated cane juice*, sunflower lecithin*, golden berries (*certified organic) (Dairy and soy free, may contain traces of nuts).<br />Size: 57g/ 2oz.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/17/12 - finally Amazon has it back in stock!  Woo Hoo!  BUT what arrived was completely melted so that it was like chocolate tapioca pudding in a pouch.  Boo Hoo!!! : (  Amazon CSR said she would have a replacement sent to me when it was back in stock.....<br /><br />UPDATE 10/18/12 - the four pack that arrived today was in pristine condition!  I ate two boxes upon arrival!  These are sooooooooooooooooooooo tasty!<br /><br />UPDATE 10/26/12 - the four pack that arrived 10/19 was again in pristine condition like 10/18 delivery!  Unfortunately, I have eaten them all and they are out of stock.  : (<br />Please get more in stock, so I can order more!

review/text: I initially found these little gems under the "manager's special" section; and what a sweet deal they were!<br /><br />  Actually, this was my first experience with "golden berries".  I had previously thought of buying them plain- due to their health benefits, etc.  However, when I found these covered in dark chocolate, I just couldn't resist!!  If given a choice, I would pick these over chocolate covered raisins any day of the week- they're just that good!  I love the slight sour bite of the golden berries; and the (60%) dark chocolate compliments them perfectly!!  This is now my favorite chocolate covered item next to "Kopali Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans"!  I also love the fact that they're organic.<br /><br />  ...Now if only Amazon would start selling these again!!

review/summary: $$$ but worth it
review/text: My only complaint is the price.  This stuff is expensive!  Amazon is the best place to buy it, although you have to pay attention to the price per ounce.  Depending on the packaging/size container the value varies quite a bit.  My son is 7 months old and was a very fussy baby up until he was about 4.5 months old.  Colicky, reflux, possible milk protein sensitivity, generally unhappy...  He is still primarily breast fed but when he does get formula, this is all we've ever used.  We are just now slowly switching him to another, less expensive formula.

review/summary: GREAT formula
review/text: My baby boy has Acid reflux really bad, and even though we had him on the gentlease formula and also on Zantac, he still was throwing up quite a bit. So I decided to move to a soy based formula with out iron, because that is the main cause for acid reflux, and I can tell you right now, that even only after two days, my son not only feels so much better, he's happy and he's not throwing up nearly as much as he was. He is still only doing half and half of both formulas, but I can definately see a BIG difference in him after starting this formula.

review/summary: Baby wouldn't drink it, didn't help much, insane price
review/text: From crazzeto's wife:<br />My baby developed a milk intolerance and very bad acid reflux around 2 months so we had to switch from breastmilk to Nutramigen and she HATED it. We had to flavor every bottle with expensive vanilla powder just to get her to drink it, and she still had a lot of pain and feeding difficulties. It's also three or four times more expensive than other types of formula, and honestly I think it is mostly because the company knows that if your baby needs it this is your only option and will have to pay whatever price they give you. We ended up switching to Similac Sensitive after a while and although she had more reactions to it, at least she would actually drink it and gain weight (unlike with this stuff) and it was cheaper too.

review/summary: Wow! Mild and Decaf ...
review/text: I confess - I don't drink coffee much in the morning. But I love a warm cup on a cold evening, which is why I go with decaf.<br /><br />I ordered this particular coffee along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002D4CKYA">Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Ground Coffee, Decaffeinated, 8oz., 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> directly from Gevalia.<br /><br />I tried the Chocolate Truffle first, and enjoyed it a lot. Both are mild and do not leave me with an "acid tummy." I have had both in the evening, and have not experienced any sleeplessness.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, I enjoyed both the taste and the smell of this particular flavor. The raspberry is there without being overwhelming, and there is just a trace of the chocolate flavor.<br /><br />For those looking for a pleasant evening drink, I do recommend this.

review/summary: Great price for a fun item.
review/text: My daughter is Chinese, and each year we send hong bao (red envelopes) to school for her to pass out to her classmates.  In China, children receive hong bao on New Year (CNY) from their families, with money inside.  For several years we purchased chocolate coins, but due to a child in her class having a severe peanut allergy, we didn't want to use chocolate coins because we could not be sure they were produced in a peanut-free factory.  So we ordered four packages of these bubble gum coins.  The coins are wrapped in bright foil.  It is a bit hilarious that we were using coins stamped with Mexican words and symbols for CNY, but the kids didn't seem to notice or care.  The gum is predictably a bit hard.  All things considered, a fun item.

It tastes like a vinaigrette but with just enough sweetness.  I also love that it doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup. I compared the label on this to lots of other brands and this one was the only one that didn't contain HFCS or red dye.  I did not have the experience the other reviewer did, I think they got a bad bottle.  I personally love this stuff.

review/text: i was incredibly mad at this company because i needed the cherry kinda and i didnt realize until moments after that this was just orange and not an entire combo as it appeared in the photo. the product wasnt bad and i was able to order the right stuff. i just wish i hadnt needlessly spend the money on something i didnt need at the time. i finally just used it this week, nothing to write home about, just your average orange snow cone syrup. im glad they changed the picture to be more accurate. and not a bad product if its actually what you wanted.

review/summary: Good Product!
review/text: I was dismayed to see the two negative reviews for this product. This is an excellent syrup (I use it for slushies). It is not the manufacturer's fault that the people who bought it can't read.
