review/summary: An amazing price for a pound of good hops.
review/text: After spending $2-$3 an ounce for hops, that were occasionally out of stock, I decided to purchase a pound knowing that it would get used quickly. These hops arrived quickly and are exactly what local shops carry.

review/summary: Great all ginger tea
review/text: This is all ginger root tea. The tea bags come in a resealable bag to keep them fresh. Most ginger teas have other herbs blended with the ginger, which can mask the ginger flavor. Not this one, its all ginger root.<br /><br />I wish Amazon would carry it so as to avoid the shipping charge!

review/text: My husband purchased this.  And he loves the juice.  I am not a major fan.  As a side note though, I noticed that the Dollar Tree down the street from us offers guava juice, and I think it is the same brand.  That would be a cheaper way to purchase this product.  But I don't know if all the stores sell it.

review/summary: Sauce is Pretty Greasy
review/text: I ordered this brand because I like to have some on hand for quick lunches or late night snacks and these were priced considerably less than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OU5EFW">Hormel Beef Tamales, In Chili Sauce, 15-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)</a> (my usual brand).  The tamales themselves tasted fine to me, maybe not quite as spicy as Hormel but still good.  I did not like all the grease though floating around on the plate from the sauce.  The tamales didn't taste particularly greasy but I really did not like the sauce - gross.  I'll save the other 11 cans in our emergency food supply and most likely just discard the sauce and eat the tamales only..Not a bad product if you discount the greasy sauce but I'll be sticking with Hormel for future purchases - the tamales taste good to me and the sauce is not nearly as greasy.<br /><br />Update - I just checked again and Hormel Tamales are available again through Subscribe and Save AND they are several dollars less expensive than La Preferida. I just signed up. LOL

review/summary: Buy the bigger 1.2 oz. pack of 36 eggs instead
review/text: I preface this review by saying that due to disability, I am unable to see product pictures, so purchasing this product was sort of a crap shoot.  However, the description of this item left a lot to be desired.  I should have trusted my gut instinct and not purchased this particular product.  I was hoping for the typical-size Reese's eggs, in their individual cardboard and plastic.  What this is, is 12 little mini-peanut butter eggs wrapped in foil, in a plastic egg carton sort of thing.  Are they good?  Sure they are.  Will I keep and eat them?  Obviously yes, but I won't order them again, unless the price is considerably lower for the quantity included.  I'll just get the 36-count of the 1.2-oz. Reese's Peanut Butter Eggs instead, as it's a much better deal.

review/text: I love these raisins, and sun maid is the best I have tasted so far.  This packaging with the little boxes is perfect to grab and go.  If my energy drops while I am out I just reach in my purse and have just the right snack to keep going.  These also taste amazing, it's a good thing I got them in this packaging, I can see myself easily just eating the whole bag.  I have even converted my husband, instead of a candy bar I give him a box of raisins instead he loves them and with fewer calories it has helped in his quest to lose weight, he is down 30 pounds so far.  Just from cutting back in these little ways, I have also lost 40 pounds and the raisins are good for you, kind of like concentrated wine to me.  I was having liver problems and switching to these type of snacks along with exercise has cured my liver ailment.  I say try them to anyone, my husband was a chocolate bar, I hate yogurt guy and he loves these yogurt covered raisins.  Recommend them to everyone when they ask about our change in diet.  I know they aren't perfect the sugar in the yogurt is high.  My one and only recommendation to sun maid is to find a sugar free yogurt the raisins are sweet enough.

review/text: Just received this loose tea today and finished my first cup. It is probably sweet enough for many to drink without any sugar at all, although I added some agave nectar. I am off to make another cup and will reduce the sweetener (though I only use a teaspoon anyway, I will probably be happy with half that). The directions say to use two teaspoons of the tea per 8 ounce cup when preparing red teas, but I tried one teaspoon and it was plenty, so right there we have doubled the servings. An excellent deal also, especially with Subscribe and Save.

review/text: Once again I'm thrilled with Davidson's! I've ordered three pounds of tea and each one is as delicious as the next. Who would't want a tastier and cheaper alternative to bagged tea?<br /><br />Looks pretty in a glass container, loose. I drink at least 8 cups of tea per day since I discovered Davidson's. Perfect to add some aroma and reduce cravings at my desk job. I wish I could give them more business but their product is inexpensive and lasts forever. I resteep leaves 2-4 times. The photo is misleading, they come in airtight plastic/foil lined paper bags with a resealable zip seal. I keep mine in containers though.<br /><br />I started with the Moroccan Green w/Mint, which is mild in flavor and only slightly minty. It's my go-to tea. The Earl Grey w/Lavender is bold and leaves a fresh taste in the mouth. The Cranberry Orange herbal is perfect for relaxing or curbing sugar cravings later in the day.  It's not quite as good of a value, since it's herbal you have to use twice as much and I haven't had much success with resteeping.  However, that's to be expected with herbal teas with so much fruit flavor.

review/text: I bought this to test it for favor and because I to not like tea bags--they leave a paper taste. I wanted an herbal tea to drink instead of coffee and to have a change from regular tea. I use a coffee toddy to  make my teas. The coffee toddy comes with two filters. I use one for coffees and one for teas. I emptied the whole bag of this tea into the toddy and added water making sure all of the tea was well coated with water. I covered the toddy and let it sit for 12 hours. After the 12 hours I let the liquid tea drain into the glass toddy container. To use the tea I use 8 teaspoons for an approximately 500 ml cup. It is good cold or hot. The favor is very good. I do use stevia for a sweeter. The next time I make it, I will add more water, say another 200 ml, because the tea absorbs much of the water. After making the tea in the toddy, I gently rinse the filter, leave it wet, place it in a resealable plastic baggie, and store it in the frig. The tea I made lasts approximately 3 weeks in the frig at the usage rate of one of my servings every 2-3 days. Enjoy.

review/summary: A Decent Lapsing Souchong
review/text: The tea I ordered was Lapsing Souchong; I would never buy cranberry orange! And if you like a super-smoky tea that will knock your socks off and wake you up, this is it.  This one is a little more bitter than some of the Souchong I buy, but for the money it is a terrific bargain.  What I do is blend some loose orange pekoe or English breakfast in with it when I put part of it in a tin, to cut the flavour and also make it last longer.  I am actually hooked on it... nothing motivates me or gets me going like this blend of tea.  I call it "Magic Tea"! A word of warning: it is something you either love or you hate; I only have one friend who will touch it, and for some odd reason my dog loves it also, and will steal it.

review/text: I grew up on this stuff. My dominican grandmother (born and raised) use to make this all of the time with milk and vanilla extract. My cousins and I would wait for it to cool in our favorite bowls and then eat the corners until we made it to the center which stayed warm the longest of course. And we loved the sweet skin the cereal would make on top once cooled.

review/summary: Farina Creamy ot Wheat Cereal
review/text: This is a terrific product and I wonder why it has virtually disappeared off supermarket shelves.  Generations of babies used to eat it as their first cereal, but now cereals have gotten very fancy: flavored, instant-cooking, and loaded with additives other than just vitamins.  I have severe food allergies, and although I can eat wheat, I cannot eat most additives.  I cannot eat soy products, for example, and therefore cannot eat any commercial baked goods, all of which contain soy lethecin (an emulsifier) or, worse, bean derivatives (guar gum, carob gum), or corn derivatives(xanthine gum).  I can eat Farina without any unhappy reactions whatsoever.<br /><br />If people wonder why there are so many food allergies around now, let them just read the printed contents labels carefully.  Commercial products these days contain everything but the kitchen sink.  Even ice cream contains bean gums!

review/text: Evilly delicious.  The caramel is quite good...and the apple center tasts rather like Jolly Rancher green apple candy.  All in all...it's pretty tasty for the calories...with delicious taffy-apple flavor.<br /><br />I like "pops" or suckers...or whatever you want to call them when I'm trying to lose weight.  It gives me something tasty for my sweet tooth...and something to do with my hands.<br /><br />Like other Tootsie Products...the nicest thing about this pop is the quality sucker stick.  None of that gooey paper after you've had it in your mouth that you can get from other rather "stupid" pops.

review/text: The texture of these candies is really nice -- soft and chewy, but not too chewy.  The flavor is just so-so though.  They aren't nearly as fruity as I'd like, and there isn't a big difference between the flavor of the different colors.  I used to get Brach's Sour Squirms, which were made with real fruit juice, but I think they stopped making them.  So I'm looking for a replacement, and this is not it.

review/text: I have ordered this licorice from another seller several times.  It comes in sweet and fresh and the perfect consistency.  I mistakenly ordered this and was quite miffed when I received it.  It was hard and actually hurt to chew it.  So while the brand itself is the best I have ever found this product is terrible.  I suggest looking for the three pack that comes in plastic rather than this product that comes in a box.  If I had ordered this product first, I would have never ordered this brand again.

review/summary: Amazing service.
review/text: I guess I should focus on the product more than the company, but I can't help it!  I started thinking it would be smart to buy bulk, whole spices online since it's cheaper and more efficient.  So, I noticed Whole Spice here on Amazon and decided to go with them!<br /><br />The nutmeg I purchased is great!  It arrived in less than one week, packaged very well, and the glass bottle the nutmeg is held in is clearly very thick and durable.  Not to mention, the label is even pretty - always a bonus!  :)<br /><br />The 1.1 oz bottle has about 8-10 nuts that were all a very good size.  I'm almost sure it could last me a lifetime.  So, the price of this product is obviously a good deal, and from experience, much cheaper than most grocery stores (including mega-stores, like Walmart.)

There are no major allergen categories, no corn syrup, no gluten, no casein, no artificial dyes, no GMO, no MSG, 100% vegan; and yet they are 100% tasty and made with with 100% natural flavors!  There are delicious fruity pops, puckering sour pops, vitamin C pops, hot chili pops, and even organic candy drops.  At little more than 5 calories per pop, you can feel free to indulge in any or all of the tasty flavors whenever the Yummy Earth pop urge catches up with you.  I have Yummy Earth Lollipops stashed in my purse, in my desk, in my backpack, in my candy jar, and ....I know wherever and whenever I enjoy these delicious treats, my body truly is enjoying them too - with nothing harmful nor full of empty calories1 That is a real treat for me, and I know you will love them just as much as I do.

review/summary: pretty darn good, so far the best
review/text: I like this one the best of the instant coffees I've tried recently from Amazon (Douwe Egbert, Jacob's Kronung, Jacob's Cronat Gold, various Nescafe products, etc.). Years ago I had some terrific instant while traveling in Europe, but I never found quite the same stuff.  This Cronat Gold, however, is very good and I like it far more than their other products. I tend to do a lot of a/b testing to really compare stuff, and so far this one is on top. I tend to make it a bit stronger to get the full flavor, as this has a surprisingly rich flavor (a lot of american coffee just tastes like tea made from wood chips, often over roasted and/or simply poor quality beans).  However they did it, this ends up tasting like unusually good coffee...and it's quick and convenient and stores well. The Douwe stuff comes in a jar that's nice enough to reuse, but their coffee wasn't as good and had a chemical taste to me.  This doesn't have that drawback.

It comes in jars that are beautiful for storing hardware or other small items and lining them up on a shelf.  I look at the hundreds of dollars I have spent on Amazon and have buyer's remorse for most of it.

review/text: Apparently the customer below bought Marinade only. You need both Marinade and Grill 'N Dip to make bourbon chicken! The Marinade adds smokey flavor to the meats, while Grill 'N Dip adds salty and sweet flavor. I found good cooking tips on the manufacturer's website and recommend all bourbon chicken lovers to take a look.

review/summary: A great Product but bottle easily mistaken
review/text: I love this product but like many, I initally made the error of onfusing the marinade with the dipping sauce ( the sweet stuff we all know).<br /><br />  I did a little research and found that you really do need the marinade for the meat then the the dipping sauce to capture the flavor.<br />  First I have to say that it is easy to get the marinade and the dipping sauce packages mixed up.  Just remember, Red label/cap is the Dippng sauce that has the familar bourbon flavor and Yellow label/cap is the marinade that goes so well with it.<br /><br />  I made the same mistake becuase I was not familar with the product and it's packaging and was just as frustrated as anyone else would be but I decided not to let the marinade( yellow cap) I bought go to waste.  So I tried it on Salmon, baked it then used the dipping sause(red cap).<br />  Long story short, everyone was raving about it and when I took some to work for lunch, co-workers asked what resturant I went to.<br /><br />  Also for the heck of it, tried it on turkey wings and it turned out great.  I didn't even bother with the dipping sauce in that case, it gave the meat a nice rich flavor and served it over brown rice and steamed veggies.<br /><br />  So please before you pick up that bottle look at the color label/cap and remember-red is the dipping sauce ( bourbon flavor) and yellow is the marinade.

review/summary: Besides bourbon chicken, great marinade all around!
review/text: I first bought this product in my neighborhood Publix supermarket and then here for a better case price. Loved it! As the other reviewer said, for authentic bourbon chicken you also need the other product in the line, Grill n' Dip sauce. I also found this marinade works really well with turkey and surprisingly, salmon! Definitely my favorite marinade for that extra smokey flavor.

review/summary: Tastes LIke Perfume
review/text: Yes, they should say artificial rose water flavor.  I thougt it was natural where it says rose flavor.  Flavor usually means artificial unless it says natural flavor though.  This flavor is probably distilled from petroleum.  Maybe I'll use it to scent handkerchiefs or something.<br /><br />I just assumed that after paying $4 for one bottle and it being from an ethnic store, maybe they wouldn't know about making it with artificial flavor.  I must tell you, after one sip, I can't stand any more.<br /><br />It says no preservatives, so it gives you that natural vibe impression.  I guess if it had real rosewater, it would have preservatives.  I feel like I have been tequiyaed.<br /><br />If you drink this stuff you may end up hating the whole idea of rose water for life.

review/summary: Love Knorr Garlic Herb Sauce and Amazon.com!
review/text: We love the Knorr Garlic Herb Sauce and I use it in several dishes. Unfortunately the only 2 supermarkets in my city don't carry it. The store that did was bought out by Kroger and they don't carry it. I was really happy to find it here on amazon.com. I make a great bow-tie pasta dish using this sauce(+ grilled chicken, onions, etc.), in fact I made it last night..YUM! We haven't had this dish in months because I couldn't find the sauce mix anywhere. I tried other sauces and they just weren't as good. Knorr makes quality products and this is no exception.<br /><br />And have I mentioned I LOVE amazon.com? This is the second product that disappeared from my store shelves that I have found here. Thanks Amazon you save me time, money, and frustration!!!!

review/summary: The best for low carb or diabetic diets..tastes exactly the same as regular pasta!
review/text: This is great stuff. You really cannot tell the difference from this and regular pasta. It is not filled with too much fiber so you get over full or gas pains. It is made by a patented process that relies on technology that creates a matrix in the grain that does not allow absorption of the carbs (I have no idea what that means), they pass through without the sugar levels rising like regular macaroni. I have diabetes type 2 and this is a savior. My blood sugar for example was 109 before eating this and after 1 hour was 122, after 2 hours it was 107. I usually have it with a marinara or meat sauce but even plain with garlic and butter this tastes wonderful! Simply amazing stuff!

review/summary: Dream Fields
review/text: The whole line of Dreamfields Pastas claims to be much lower in carbohydrates than most and that is a very good thing. Pasta is known for its high content of carbs and being the situation that it is not permissible to indulge so liberally in large amounts of carbs, Dreamfields is what you would call a low carb eater pleasure. I have read many opposing views as to their claims and many more views at to their merits, and personally, I take sides with the majority that celebrates their existence in a rather meager market where options of low carb pasta are almost non existing. Of the few that are around I definitely put Dreamfields at the top. Why? Because it does not taste or cook like something other than real pasta. Goes well with sauces, without sauces just butter and parmesan and even their lasagna allows for that tasty dish to be enjoyed without a large amount of guilt. I can only trust the numbers the company throws at consumers to be based on solid research and information.  The fact of the matter is that being able to enjoy pasta such as this makes a lot of people very happy, and I am first on that list. Did not like the fact that for a while amazon stopped selling it because it told me that either the demand was low or that the company did not want to do business with amazon. For a while there I could not find it under amazon prime, just at outside vendors and the prices had seriously skyrocketed upwards to justify the purchase. Yes, I knew of other places where to obtain this same pasta (not the manufacturer which I find a little tad on the difficulty side) but another credible internet store that specializes in very healthy A-Z alternatives. I found this one, Dreamfields Pasta Healthy Carb Living, Penne Rigate, 13.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6), in amazon and I immediately made the purchase because I would be misleading if I did not say that I prefer to deal mostly with amazon for I never have any issues that I later regret and that is saying a lot. 4 Stars.

review/summary: A waste of money
review/text: Not only did I purchase the six pack of pasta, I used the Subscribe and Save option so that I could have my low carb pasta delivered every two weeks. I thought this would change my low carb life. Wrong.<br /><br />5 grams of carbs per two ounce serving? Sounds too good to be true. Feel free to conduct your own research, but I think you'll find your body has no problem metabolizing this into glucose just as quickly as all the other pastas. The nutrition information on the side of the box states 41 grams of carbs per tiny 2 ounce serving. Apparently, the 31 grams of "Protected Carbs" exist only in the minds of those at Dreamfields. Google "Glycemic Response to Ingested Dreamfields Pasta Compared With Traditional Pasta" for more information.<br /><br />I'm sorry to to dispute the claims of the company, as I do not have a lab to conduct a study and prove them wrong, but I'm highly skeptical of their claims. I wanted to believe. I thought this would be a miracle, and I bought into it. I think I wasted my money.<br /><br />That being said, the pasta is delicious. I could not distinguish this pasta from any other "normal" pasta.

review/summary: Beats the stink!
review/text: Having cats for most of my life (as in I remember litter that didn't clump being the only option that and actually letting your cat go where ever the cat went when you "gasp" let it outside) I am familiar with the woe of the litter box. However for something that literally gets defecated on and thrown out, litter is pretty pricey. Yet no one wants their house to have that "crazy cat lady" odor. I only have one cat but in my single days I had a LOT more (working at a vet will do that for you) and what type of litter to use, what was safest for your cat, what covered the smell, etc. has been an ongoing conundrum.<br />Also lugging the containers home is just such a pain. Unless you want to buy it once a week you have to carry at least 20 pounds from the car to the house.<br />Luckily Amazon and their wonderful Subscribe and Save program have simplified my life! Someone else does the lugging, I get the price break of buying the larger container so with the savings I can buy  the Arm & Hammer brand which is WAY better than cheaper or store brand litter. It's a win/win all around. As I write this I am less than 20 feet away from the litter boxes and I can't smell a thing!

review/summary: Product is great but new packaging by A&H is not
review/text: This cat litter is the best I have found.  I am a foreign service officer and use to purchase it while at my previous post.  I had extra boxes shipped to my next post and while that shipment arrived (6 months till I got settle at the next post) I purchased more cat litter for my cats.<br /><br />Now that I have settled at my new post and can look at the previous boxes and the new, I noticed two differences:  1) The new packaging no longer places the litter in a plastic bag inside the litter box; and 2) the box top now has a handle.  While the handle may make it easier to transport the box, not having a plastic bag holding the litter inside the box lets the litter spill out from the seams very easily.<br /><br />I love the product, but I will no longer purchase it while in this packaging because all five boxes I have purchased to arrive at my new post have arrived with the litter spilling out of the seams, making a mess of the mailroom as well as losing some of the product.  To clarify, this has nothing to do with the packaging Amazon does, it is from the manufacturer.

That being said, the scent of this litter is quite over powering. Although the scent itself isn't bad, it might be a problem for those with a sensitive nose or are picky.<br /><br />I look forward to trying the unscented version if I can ever find it in-store. I really do like the packaging of this brand. There is a pour spout at one edge that makes things a lot easier.<br /><br />Arm & Hammer is worth a try and tends to be cheaper than brands such as Tidy Cats.

review/text: Can't go wrong with Arm & Hammer clumping cat litter products if that is what you are seeking.  This size box is a nice size, and works great for multiple cat households.  The product's smell is a bit strong initially, but it works well to cover the scents associated with urine, etc, and it works great at masking those types of odors before you can scoop it.  For the price offered on Amazon, it is a good deal.  Tracking for this is low although there will be some, but that is to be expected with any smaller clumping-type litter.

review/summary: Very convenient
review/text: Before I order anything online, I try to research as much as possible.  There were so many comments complaining about the packaging, stating that the litter was spilling out of the box when it arrived.  I was under the assumption that the Arm & Hammer box was shipped alone.  And that may be the case if shipped from another supplier, but I have a monthly subscription from Amazon. The 40lb litter box is placed in a different Amazon box before it ships.  Some of my litter spilled out too, but I just simply poured the 2 tablespoons back into the original box.  The subscription saves money and makes things so convenient, since it's delivered right to the door each month.  Then the shipping is free on top of all that.  Lifting 40lbs is no prob for me, but my girlfriend sure does appreciate the free delivery.<br />  Pertaining to the effectiveness of the litter......  I am a dog person, so being around cats is new to me.  I made my girlfriend try at least 10-12 different types of litter, and found that none of them work perfectly.  Arm & Hammer works for us since it meets most requirements better than others.  (masks odor better than any other I've tried, clumps well, inexpensive)  Then the subscription makes it so convenient.  This is a real unsolicited review....the type that I look for when I scan other reviews to help me make a decision.  I hope this helps someone.

review/text: I should have paid attention to the other reviews! I bought it because it is Arm & Hammer. But, this litter has such an overpowering smell. It's too much. Also, it makes so much dust that I choke when I am scooping litter. Every surface in my office (where I keep the litterbox) is covered with fine dust. I can't keep up with it. You have to wonder about the long-term affects of breathing that in, for both me & my cat.<br /><br />On the plus side, it does scoop well. It stays clean - no particles that have broken away, no slime on the edges from urinating at the side of the box. So, it lasts much longer than other brands.

review/summary: Arm&Hammer Multi-Cat Clumping Litter - the best I've seen on-line
review/text: Recently, our local supermarket closed.  The thing that bothered me most was that that supermarket had always carried the 40lb A&H Cat Litter for a highly reasonable price (it was under $15.00).  The other stores around here only sell small packages, which end up costing much much more.<br /><br />I went on-line and priced the Arm & Hammer Cat Litter - there were very low prices which had amazingly high shipping costs, and then, I remembered that I have Amazon Prime, so I went back to Amazon, and found my litter for a good bit more than what I was paying at my supermarket, but much less than any other place locally was charging, and, if we factor in that, with Amazon Prime, there are no shipping charges, the price was lower than any Internet source.<br /><br />I got the box in 2 days (just in time -- I couldn't get the cats to stop going while we waited for it)<br /><br />In short, we were very satisfied with the service from Amazon on this product which we like (unless we find a better price locally, we'll probably continue to buy from Amazon)

review/summary: By far My Favorite Litter
review/text: I'm not a fan of the UltraLast variety, but Arm & Hammer litter works really well, especially this version.  We have one cat but buy this litter almost exclusively.  We don't empty the litter all that often, so smell control is very important.  Our cat seems to like it and most guests seem surprised to find out we own a pet, so I count that as an A+ performance.
