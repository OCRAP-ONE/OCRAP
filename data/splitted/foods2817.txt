review/text: I used a higher priced senna for several years and out of the need to economize I tried alvita. Works just as well and is not individually wrapped as the others are and for me it's just one less thing I have to do considering I fix this every evening for me and hubby... I have medical problems so anything that saves me extra step I'm happy for it...

review/summary: Nasty tea debris everywhere!
review/text: When I opened this alot of the tea sacks were broken and the tea emptied out and spilled everywhere. I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!

review/summary: Sage Tea - helping with hot flashes
review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/text: I purchased this tea because it is recommended for helping women's PMS symptoms and menopause symptoms.  I've only had one cup of it, so I can't say if it has helped my symptoms or not.  I have purchased other teas of this brand.  I would recommend their teas.  I wasn't crazy about the taste of the red clover, but that is just my personal opinion.  It's a little bitter but bearable.  Add some sugar and you're good to go.

review/summary: Interesting taste
review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

Drinking Fenugreek tea, taking L-Arginine supplements and getting a good nights' sleep (6 hour min.). Well, I am going to give it a shot. This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad. It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually. I wasn't able to find this tea in any local supermarkets but here it is on Amazon. Seems they have everything!

review/text: I have one cup a day and it really decreases my night sweats. I'm in amazement at how much it helps!<br /><br />The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/summary: Quick and Savory Gluten-Free Meal!
review/text: The Snapdragon General Tsao rice pasta dish is an amazingly delicious, mildly spicy treat!  I wasn't sure if the product was gluten-free until I researched the product on their own site, reading the ingredients list carefully.  The packaging labeling backs up the fact that it is safe for celiacs!<br /><br />The rice noodles cook in less than five minutes.  If you are in a big hurry, you can simply pour the General Tsao sauce over the cooked rice noodles and enjoy.  If you have the time, you can add more savory ingredients to the mix, including meats, tofu, and veggies.  The sauce itself is pretty darn good and is slightly on the spicy side.  I personally enjoy EXTREMELY spicy food, so this only provided a tiny bit of a kick, which can be all you need at times!<br /><br />Glad that I found another delicious gluten-free product that I can enjoy!  It seems as though the more time that passes, the more wonderful (and varied) gluten-free foods come out on the market.  Great news!<br /><br />I also ordered the Pad Thai Ginger flavor, but it hasn't arrived yet.  I will give feedback soon enough regarding the flavor!  Please note that there are about five other Snapdragon products that are certified gluten-free (and a few that are NOT).  Check out their website for more information.<br /><br />*** Edit mid-July 2011***<br /><br />This review used to give the product four out of five stars.<br /><br />The day after I wrote this review, I took my leftover General Tsao noodles to work for lunch.  After reheating them, I found the flavor to be somewhat bitter and completely unappealing.  Ever since then, whenever I cook the dish, I have bad experiences with it.  The pasta itself is wonderful... the sauce is the problem.  I just tried it again tonight, cooking the meal in a different manner with some ingredients thrown in to try and enhance the flavor.  The bitter taste of the sauce overtook everything and I am left with a nasty taste lingering in my mouth.  Needless to say, I cancelled my subscribe and save subscription.  I really tried to like this, but at the end of the day, the flavor of the sauce simply repulses me.  I seriously wonder what I was tasting the first time through.  Not good.

They don't seem to have the texture that we have enjoyed in other crackers.  Just a matter of taste, I guess, but we are going back to the Crunchmasterr crackers if we can find them.

review/summary: Is it legal to taste this good?
review/text: While I don't have more than 4 soft drinks a week, I make an exception for Jarritos, especially the lime flavor here. It's cheap, tastes perfect, comes in a glass bottle which helps with the taste, and uses real cane sugar instead of whatever the guys at Coke use. If you're looking for a lime soda that actually tastes like lime, go with this. Every sip I take of the lime flavor is savored, and I never want to rush through a bottle. If the drug cartels in Mexico fought eachother over Jarritos, I'd understand.<br /><br />But I want to let any potential customers who are health nuts to know that while this is only a 13.5 oz bottle, if you drink the whole thing in one sitting like most will, it counts as two servings. 28g of sugar and 29g of carbs per serving makes this a bit more (health-wise) than the usual drinks available. Also, I'd recommend looking for these in your local grocery stores, as they're much cheaper than what's being shown here.

review/summary: I like this mustard a lot...BUT
review/text: ...But, I wish I had bought the powder instead. If you have never tried this mustard before, get the powder. You just add a little water (or other liquids) and make it a paste when you're ready to use it. This jar is SUPER small. For the price it would have been much better to just get the powder, and be able to use it in dry rubs for meats as well as a wet mustard paste. If you have never had this product before, it tastes like a dijon with a stronger kick, almost like a chinese mustard. With the dry mustard you can add more to make it stronger (which i like to do b/c this isnt hot enough for my taste!!). So, word of the wise: buy the powder mustard!!

review/summary: The best!
review/text: This is the perfect mustard to eat with ham sandwiches (or any sandwich that needs a kick of flavor), bangers, or even Chinese food. I've noticed that my favorite Chinese restaurants' hot mustard bears a strong resemblance to this, and I haven't been able to find any mustards this good at the nearby Asian groceries - I'd wager my local restaurants have giant jars of this in the kitchen instead.

review/summary: I Throw Away Other Cheese Straws
review/text: First of all, I would like to comment regarding previous reviews. I do not think the first review in 2005 was done by an employee, and that's not really a fair statement but rather an assumption lacking any real fact or evidence. It seems like a very small company that just enjoys making cheese straws and wants to share them with others. I sincerely doubt that, at the great price they are, the company even makes a ton of profit - which is a shame.<br /><br />Secondly, after tasting Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws for the first time this Fall, I will not eat anyone else's. I literally threw away a package of a VERY POPULAR cheese straw company that I received yesterday as a gift because when I tasted them, they just tasted bland and floury. I could not even bring myself to finish them. I crave Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws so much. (I recommend trying them with some Shiraz or other wine!)<br /><br />Our company gave out Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws as a corporate customer gift this year, and I bet that Aunt Lizzie will have a slew of new customers after that. Thanks, Aunt Lizzie!! :)

review/summary: Yummy, but...
review/text: These cheese straws are very yummy. Unfortunately, I felt that they were making me gain weight as part of my low carb diet. I gained three pounds in the week that I bought them eating maybe a couple of handfuls a day. So, while very delicious, they may not work well for my diet.<br /><br />Update: I see that the product Amazon took me to write this review was not exactly the product I ordered. I ordered the low carb tin.

review/summary: 1st Review Written By Employee
review/text: If you read the first review and then read the company literature it will become obvious that the 1st review was either written by an employee or was copied from the literature. I will say the cheese straws are the best I have ever tasted. From the flavor to the crunchy feel in my mouth, I am addicted to Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. The negative? Customer service is non existent. An order that was placed on the internet was subsequently lost, even though I received a confirmation via email. I was offered no discount or upgraded shipping, no additional product with my order, no discount on my next order, not even an apology for the 7 day delay. Just an excuse that the email order was lost and that her IT guy would be on the problem tomorrow. Personally, I can count the number of times an email has been lost over the last 10 years on one hand. This is not the first problem I have had with an order. They do not give a tracking number with each order and when asked for one after the order is placed the odds of getting one are 50-50. I have had so many problems with my orders I will go without my Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. I will miss them greatly however I need the hassle associated with ordering them less than I need the cheese straws. ANN, I wish you the best in the future and suggest you participate in customer service training classes to refrain from losing additional customers in the future. FOLLOW UP: I just received an email notifying me that my order shipped on the Aug 9th. I have not placed an order! What more can they do?

review/summary: Brach's Candy Corn doesn't taste the same...
review/text: The candy corn had many imperfections, was grainier, poorer appearance and just not the same.  As a candy corn officiando, I was taken aback by the foreign black spots found in the candy.  Then I looked at the bag to see where it was made and learned it is now made in Mexico.  So I went on a search for American made candy corn, which I found, so no more Brach's candy corn for this family.

The taste is now terrible and overly sugary, no hint of honey and the corn is oddly shaped and cheaply made.  If they were going to have it made it Mexico, that's one thing, but they could have at least kept the recipe and quality standards the same.  Geeze.

review/summary: Packaging Problem
review/text: While the food is good quality, it doesn't always arrive in great shape due to insufficient packaging. The shipping box is large enough, but there is never enough tape on it to keep it from opening up due to the heavy weight of the product. Every box I have ever received of this, and I have gotten about 4-5 of them, has been partially, sometimes mostly open and ripped. One bag of the food actually came with a rip in the food bag that someone then taped up with packing tape before mailing. That is totally unacceptable for a food item. I will be buying this from a nearby pet store from now on even though it is more expensive and a 25 minutes drive. Having to take a heavy package like this to the post office to return just isn't worth it.

review/summary: A little taste of home...
review/text: Having grown up in Massachusetts, birch beer (particularly white birch) was a commmon drink for me. Once I moved to North Carolina, however, that changed. For years, I was unable to buy this favorite drink, until it showed up on Amazon. For those unfamiliar with birch beer, it is very similar to root beer, only sweeter and less carbonated (more like 7-Up than typical root beer with the healthy head on top). It comes in several varieties, with white (clear), red and black being the most common, and is mostly available in the northeastern United States. However, if you like root beer at all, you will LOVE birch beer. I recently bought a case of it, and am enjoying it immensely. For those displaced northerners, this is a little taste of home that will bring back memories.

They're nearly fist sized!  They've got a nice firm texture, denser than the typical marshmallows found at the supermarket.  They taste like, well ... marshmallows.  :)

review/text: I found these in one of my local grocery stores & couldn't help but pick up a few bags to bring into work as a nice treat for my co-workers. The marshmallows were so gigantic that everyone got a HUGE kick out of this product. While there is a lot of sugar in this product, this made for a nice snack for those at work who were avoiding other sugary snacks such as candy bars & the like that might have a higher amount of calories.<br /><br />The best part about this is the size & they look like they'd be FANTASTIC for roasting over an open fire. (I'll try that with my next bag.) I do have to warn against putting these in a microwave unless you watch it *very* closely. As with any marshmallow, this does expand & can overtake a plate if you aren't careful. (One of my coworkers almost found this out the hard way.)<br /><br />The flavors (strawberry & vanilla) taste pretty good & this will make for a wonderful dessert to pack inside of a child's lunch. (It'll be bigger than the average kid's fist, so one will be all that you need.)<br /><br />All I know is that I plan on buying this again in the future.

review/summary: Truly the BEST
review/text: My whole family loves noodles, due to my daughter being celiac we had to switch to cooking gluten-free. Much to my dismay and my families, gluten-free noodles overall taste like crap! They don"t hold up well, either no matter how long you cook them they are still hard and then mushy, or you cook them right, but when you wanna eat them or mix them with gravy they fall apart. I am a spoiled german, it is said about us that we are extremely picky about food- a brand like "Bionaturae" (suppposedly also from Italy is litterally a insult to my toung feelwise and tastewise. Tinkyada is close, but still comparably FAR away from Le VEneziane. The taste and texture is like real noodles, cook the same too and hold up thje same. My best friend tried the LaVeneziane (which I actually brought from a germany vacation), when I had to spend a week in the hospital with my boy, and she had to take care of my daughter. She called me in the hospital even to tell me how awesome those noodles are and that they taste just like regular noodles. The other day she even asked me if she would make spaghettiesauce, if I could bring those delicious noodles- so we all can have the same as my daughter. That was a first- usually everybody is glad to not have to eat glutenfree, with this it didn't matter any more. The WANTED glutenfree noodles! While in germany we cooked those for my daughter, my dad a trained chef even commented that there is no difference to reall noodles.<br />Try them, in any shape- you will not be dissapointed!<br />PS: Just so you know- in Italy Celiac-desease is a by LAW acknowledged desease (like peanut-allergy)- it has to be declared of everything, schools have to offer glutenfree meals as an alternative- and a standard schoolscreening at the age of 7 IS Celiacs. Italinas have a fine toung too and crappy food would not last.

The texture, color, and taste are perfect. I have had other Italian pastas shipped to me for years, but nothing compares to this pasta.  I still can't believe it is wheat free.  You can serve this pasta to people not on the GF diet and they would never know it was GF.  I am still amazed and thrilled!<br /><br />Thank you!<br />Jodi McMahon<br />Houston, TX

Even if I didn't have to eat gluten free, I would prefer this to regular wheat pasta. It has a firm texture and rich flavor, not to mention the lovely golden color provided by the corn.<br /><br />I am a culinary student, blogger, caterer and instructor.

review/summary: Awesome for Fettuccine Alfredo - Gluten Free
review/text: Le Veneziane is the best Gluten Free pasta I have had, hands down. I used the fettuccine to make fettuccine alfredo. It was very easy. I boiled the noodles according to the package directions. Put a couple of chicken breasts in a fry pan and in a sauce pan combined, a small pacakge (8 oz) of cream cheese, a cube of butter, some freshly grated parmesan about 3/4 of a cup, some Italian seasoning (about a teaspoon and a half) and some garlic. I melted all of that together on medium heat. I took the pasta off and drained it, sliced up my chicken into bite size pieces and then mixed in all together in my serving dish. My family gobbled it up and requested it for dinner again soon. I making it again tonight but don't have any Le Veneziane Fettuccine left and so I am going to try it with Le Veneziane Eliche pasta. This pasta is a spiral type of pasta that my daughter requested.

review/text: My daughter loooooves pasta so when we started a gluten free casein free diet for her she was NOT happy about giving it up. She was picky even with wheat pasta, she would ask for some brands over others. She often likes it plain, so there's no hiding under sauce, either. We tried two other gluten free pastas and she wouldn't eat them (schar's and tinkyada). When she tasted this one she was absolutely thrilled. She said "It's exactly like regular except it's on the diet!" My husband said he would never have known that it was gluten free if he hadn't seen the package. It really tastes great, for any pasta, not just among the gluten free ones.

review/summary: the BEST gluten free choice to replace "regular" pasta
review/text: I don't write reviews.  I think this is my first.  This pasta was recommended to me by a friend who is also GF and I'm in love.  I mean ... I don't want to get your hopes up but *I* love it.<br /><br />This is truly the closest gluten-free pasta to "regular" semolina, enriched pasta.  It has the right flavor, and the right texture.  It is not starchy or foamy or sticky.<br /><br />It is simply the best.  I don't think I'll ever use anything else.  Well worth the plan-ahead hassle of ordering online.

review/summary: Simply the Best!
review/text: Most gluten free products don't live up to their gluten-filled counterparts.  I had given up on finding a good pasta that wasn't a gummy, tasteless mess when I stumbled on Le Veneziane.  Not only is it delicious, but I know people who don't have gluten issues who eat only this pasta!  I order it because I have only found it in one store in New York, but with Amazon, it's not a problem.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!  Enjoy!!

review/text: My wife needs to eat GF.  We discovered this pasta brand and it has been great!  My 9 and 11 year old boys enjoy it as much as my wife does!  You can barley taste the difference between this pasta and the "regular" kind.  A must buy if you must eat GF.  Note, b/c of the expense for GF pasta (this brand), typically, I make two pasta "bowls", this brand for my wife and the non-GF for the three of us. With the exception of Baked Ziti and lazania.

review/summary: Gluten free pasta alternative
review/text: I'm so excited to have more Gluten Free options available.  I purchased the Ditalini pasta for my Pasta E. Fagoili soup.  I used Ditalini all the time back in my wheat days and was so disappointed in my Wheat Free options for this recipe.  I'm so excited that this worked out so nicely.  I feel like one more piece of the puzzle has fallen back into place.  I love all the options this brand offers.  Make the switch, your non gluten family members will not be disappointed.<br /><br />* Holds its shape nicely.<br />* Taste is appealing.<br />* Held up well in my soup recipe.<br />* I did not find it to be gummy like "some" rice pastas.<br /><br />The instructions are not english though.  It does cook a bit longer than regular pasta, similar to rice pasta.  Keep your eye on it.

review/summary: Very Good Pasta
review/text: Having tried many gluten free pastas we tried this one.  It is by far the one that tastes most like pasta made with semolina wheat.  If you serve this to company they would not know the difference, except for the slightly more yellow color.  It also seems less "starchy" while cooking.  Some brands you can't even see through the cloudy water.  This one is not as bad, and takes only 9-10 minutes to cook.

The taste is rich and the texture is just like wheat pasta. My husband, who does not have celiac disease, prefers this to any wheat pasta he has ever had. I was delighted to find this product offered on Amazon, though I am sorry that now I won't have to travel to Rome to go grocery shopping, which I would have done, just to get my hands on this pasta again.  Bon appetit.

review/summary: Great little healthy reward during "potty training"
review/text: I used Blue Buffalo treats like these to reward my Yellow Lab puppy during the potty training phase.  Don't know if it was the treats or all the love and patience I gave him but he was entirely housebroken within one week after bringing him home.  Now when he hears the lid come off of the treat jar or a bag rattle that he just knows has treats in it, he's right beside me, tail-a-wagging and "a-woofing" (Not barking.  You dog owners know what I mean!)<br /><br />Blue Buffalo products may cost a llitle more but according to their labels, they aren't made with any animal by-products which can, according to numerous articles published in recognized and well respected pet and vetrinary magazines, include animal fecal waste and/or other hazardous materials not removed before processing as well as other "fillers" that are detremental to your pets' health.  Another big plus is the fact that Blue Buffalo products are made right here in the U.S.A. rather than in China where who knows what goes in or under what conditions pet food products are processed.  Remember the cheap-to-use melamine additive (filler) found not too long ago in pet food products made in China that sickened and even caused the death of hundreds of beloved pets?  Or the dried chicken breast meat treats that were contaminated with high levels of ecoli?<br /><br />My Lab has also given his approval to other Blue Buffalo products such as their healthy treat bars, chew bones, dry kibble and he's absolutely wild about their canned beef stew.  Not all items are available at amazon.com but we're hopeful that the line of Blue Buffalo products will be expanded soon.

review/summary: Another great dog treat!
review/text: My dog is not the most discriminating when it comes to edible (or not) goodies.  Just about everything is good, but  'some treats are more good than others'.  Blue Buffalo Bites have been Extremely Well Received at this house.  My dog does just a little extra dancing and wiggling when she hears the opening of a Blue Buffalo bag, though if I had to guess I think her response to the salmon flavor is just a little bit more excited.<br /><br />The treats are a nice size--not too big and not too small (maybe a centimeter square), and if you have a smaller dog the treats could be easily broken into smaller bites.  They are soft and, to the human nose, not all stinky.  Along the stinky-factor lines these treats are great as they do not produce excess 'aroma' from my dog's back end.  Many treats do, but not the Blue Bites.<br /><br />Great treat and highly recommended!<br /><br />JTG

review/summary: Fantastic CAT treat!
review/text: Yes, you read correctly! I was in PetSmart today, and I was looking for some all-natural cat treats, and ended up talking to a Blue Buffalo rep. She let me in on a little secret. Blue Buffalo doesn't sell cat treats, per se, but she said she'd been feeding her cats these treats, and they gobble them up! Well, I took her advice and grabbed a bag of them. I had my cat try them when I got home, and sure enough, she loved them! Hooray for Blue Buffalo. I have been converted! :)

review/summary: Rancid smell 3 months before "best by" date
review/text: The ingredients listed "canola and/or safflower and/or sunflower oil," and I gotta assume there was a problem with canola oil since the smell of the chips gave me a Proustian flashback to my days as an aspiring artist working with oil paints. Such flashbacks can occur because of the close family ties among rapeseed, canola and linseed oils. So I guess the lesson here is don't buy these chips within, say, 5 months of the "best by" date unless you're an artist, because if you're truly an artist, then you're starving, and if you're starving, whaddaya care if the chips smell bad.

review/text: My brother is a chiiehead and he warned me about Blair's being 'hot'. Blair's make a whole range of hot sauces, some of which are indeed outrageously high in Scoville units. This one however is quite good and about 6 times hotter than a Jalapeno. This is noticeably hotter than Tabasco but the flavor is similar to Tabasco. So, if you like that venerable standby but want something more, give this a try.<br /><br />Shipping is a significant cost if you are buying a small quantity.

review/text: My mistake for not reading the only comment that gave this a 1 star.  Just as peg noted, the item shown is NOT what you get.  Very disappointed with this type of poor advertising.  You show me a picture of a big tub'o mustard and call it a dispenser pack, guess what! I expect a big tub'o mustard not a silly refill pack!  Come on folks, let's get it together!

review/summary: GREAT hot sauce
review/text: I first found Marie Sharp's hot sauce a month or two ago at my local Wally-World.  They have since ceased to stock it, but that does not change that it is THE BEST hot sauce I have ever had.  It has a nice burn to it, but isn't harsh and has a nice flavor as well.<br /><br />In short, this is a simply spectacular condiment...
