review/text: I've been drinking white teas for years and was thrilled to find the Prince of Peach Organic White Peony teabags on Amazon.  My local store only carries the smaller box of this particular Prince of Peace tea, and since we drink it daily, Amazon will be our go to source from now on.  The tea is not the prized Silver Needle, but for an organic tea in an unbleached bag with little packaging waste that is all compostable, it's a no brainer.  I brew it at a lower temperature, usually filtering the boiled fresh water over an ice cube as its being poured onto the teabag/s.  I highly recommend this white tea!

review/text: Should have known better as 100 tea bags for $9.00 seemed awfully low. This white tea cannot compare to some of the brands available where 20 tea bags cost around $4.00. Does not even taste like a quality white tea. After 10 cups will not use any more.

review/summary: The same you get in Mexico
review/text: Eso es el mismo producto que puede obtener en Mexico, pero mandado a su puerta. I have a friend in the States who loves the candy, and this is a much cheaper option than spending lots and lots of money shipping it from Mexico yourself. The package comes with twelve 12-count bags, for a total of 144 mini canisters -- it's a great deal for the price in my opinion.

review/summary: Amazon has this listed wrong - beware!
review/text: The mini-milks usually sell 6 for about $3.25. This product that is listed for $18+ is supposed to be SIX packages of SIX mini-milks, which works out to be a little over $3 per sixpack, which is the correct price. But if you order it, they will ship only ONE six pack... making these mini-milks more expensive than the big milks (which sell at 13.5 ounce, six to a pack, for $14+)! It took me two hours talking to customer service to get this mistake corrected. The person who entered this in inventory misunderstood that it is a sixpack of sixpacks... so he/she entered it as one package of six. When I ordered this product last summer they had it listed right and the order was correct, but right now it is listed wrong.

review/summary: Listing error? Nope
review/text: Received my order today, and i am having the same problem as the previous commenter.  What should have arrived as a case of six-packs instead contained a single six-pack of mini cans.  Obviously the listing error has still not been corrected and no action was taken with the vendor.  I have a request in with Amazon now to see if the issue is corrected and my order is fulfilled correctly - until then, i'm giving this a single star.<br /><br />Update:  After 2 days, no response to my request for assistance via the customer service portal.  Called customer service, and after explaining issue and being placed on hold for quite some time, i was advised that the pricing and shipment was correct.  As i was extremely dissatisfied, i was given a refund for the price paid.<br /><br />So, for the record, the seller is indeed charging over $20 for a SINGLE six-pack of 3.5 ounce milks.

review/text: If you like real cinnamon flavored coffee, this is the K cup for you. I do not really taste anything like pastry, but the cinnamon flavor is bold and enhances the coffee flavor. I wish Timothy's would make a decaf version, as I try not to drink too much caffeine. While I also enjoy the German Chocolate Cake flavored coffee, I do not think it has the stronger coffee flavor of the Cinnamon Pastry. I have found the best prices for Timothy's coffee on Amazon.

review/text: I cannot drink this and I have 48 cups of it to get through. The cinnamon is overwhelming, and there is no chocolate taste...at all.  The coffee is definitively light, and I prefer a dark, robust roast. I shall donate this. I just hope if you like a strong cuppa joe, you don't purchase this. I thought it would be a nice after dinner coffee, but it tastes like someone opened my cinnamon jar and poured it into warm water.

I like the consistency of the flax and after adding it to my shakes for 3 weeks I have found that my digestion has improved significantly.  I only put in a heaping tablespoon and it's awesome.  If you want something to add to shakes I recommend this.  I suggest making the shake in a shaker bottle the night before, this lets the flax absorb the liquid and it's a lot softer that way.

review/summary: Absolutely nasty!
review/text: Wanting to indulge myself, I recently purchased a box of these at the local store. Unfortunately, contrary to the descripton on the box, I discovered the hard way that there is nothing "fine" about these assorted chocolates from Russell Stover. Not only are the creamy centers so sugary that they overpower the chocolate shell and make it difficult to tell what flavors they're supposed to represent, each chocolate piece has an underlying chemical taste. At first I gave the company the benefit of the doubt by assuming I'd gotten a box that had been sitting on the shelves too long, but another review of the smaller-sized version of this item (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZF13VI">Russell Stover Fine Assorted Chocolates Handcrafted in Small Batches 2oz</a> had the exact same complaint about the taste.<br /><br />So if you're ever in the mood for gourmet chocolates and you see these, run-- don't walk-- the other way! You're better off just grabbing a Ghiradelli, Lindt, Toblerone, or even a Willy Wonka instead. These are flat out nasty!

review/summary: Waste of Money!
review/text: We bought this kit because we thought it would be cute.  I never buy a kit without assuming the pieces will be cheap, but this surpassed my imagination.  Their "decorating bags" are cheap plastic bags, even though they give you professional tips (you can't screw a tip onto a plastic bag).  The result is a mess- frosting leaking from around the tip, and the seams on the bag break.  Even if it hadn't leaked, I don't think there would have been enough frosting to do the whole barn, but I lost a lot of it due to leakage.  From there, the gingerbread was too soft to hold up- the roof pieces buckled and the walls cracked.  Normally a gingerbread piece has trouble holding together due to the frosting- in this case, it was the gingerbread.<br /><br />Then, my family decided to call it a loss and just eat the mess we'd made.  Only we couldn't do that either.  The frosting was gross- not sweet, but very sticky, and the gingerbread was flavorless.  We threw the whole thing out.  I have permanently red-stained hands from the frosting leaking everywhere, so I look like I slaughtered an animal, and I have no gingerbread.  Very upsetting.  I'll never buy a kit again.

review/summary: Not The Pepper I Thought
review/text: We had tried a 1.75 oz glass shaker bottle awhile back and realized it was the pepper we were always reaching for at mealtime. So, we have been looking for "McCormick Cracked Black Pepper" ever since. I ordered this pepper as it was the same name, but it is much coarser (bigger grained) & not the same pepper as what was in our small spice bottle. I studied the empty spice bottle and noticed it also says "Gourmet Collection". Amazon states they do not accept returns on food items, so we were stuck with 2 big containers of this coarser pepper. I contacted McCormick and ordered the Gourmet Collection Cracked Black Pepper from them and the person guaranteed we would get the same exact pepper. When it arrived, it was indeed the same great pepper, but in a 1.62 oz (same style glass shaker bottle) & the label said Gourmet Collection Coarse Grind Black Pepper. Apparently, McCormick did some name changes. Also, the 2 big containers do not look like the picture - They have red lids with a rather plain black & white label - no green leaves or red McCormick label, etc. It does state they were packed in the USA by McCormick & Co. These big 16 ounce containers of pepper are probably okay pepper for grilling or where you want large specks of pepper, or perhaps could grind it in a mill for finer particles.

review/summary: A wonderful flavor that can make a low calorie Dreamsicle like treat!
review/text: If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes, over shaved ice and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />We miss shakes and ice cream and this is a good flavor to use to make such a treat. Put one to two tablespoons of this flavoring into a blender add 6 to 8 ounces of skim milk, a couple of tablespoons of vanilla sugar free pudding, and � cup of crushed ice. Blend this until smooth and you have a good tasting dietetic fruit smoothie that makes a good snack.  It tastes like a dreamsicle. You can even freeze this and have a sort of dreamsicle ice cream treat. We also used to add in a vanilla protein mix that we would add into one of these to make a light meal.  You can add more flavoring to suit your taste.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found. They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!

review/text: I was stunned and impressed by how fast the cookie order, which was a birthday present, was received by the receiver.  It arrived in advance of his birthday, which was great because the birthday card I send separately and earlier didn't get there til 2 days after his birthday.  The cookies were fresh and unbroken, and are still being enjoyed.  I would place this same order again.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I wasn't expecting much when I first bought these through a local big box store that no longer carries them.  But, they looked like a snack I could eat given my need for things that are fiber rich and generally healthier than most "treats."  My response to them was "Wow, they taste way too good to be healthy!"  The ingredients and nutrition info answer that question.<br />They are delicious, unusual--in a good way!--chocolatey, and way more satisfying than your average cookie, especially the 100 calorie packet kind.  I'm a complete convert, as is my husband, and everyone else who tries them!  Thanks, Amazon, for carrying them.  Please consider carrying more of the Praeventia and Vital Life line by Leclerc.

review/summary: Wonderful cookies, lightning fast delivery.
review/text: I used to buy these cookies at Target but haven't seen them there in months. These are whole-grain chocolate cookies that come in handy single-serving foil pouches. Great chocolate taste,not overly sweet, and a hearty dose of fiber. The maker, LeClerc, was easy to deal with and delivery was extremely fast. I ordered Thursday morning, and the cookies were at my door Saturday morning.

review/summary: Great cookies and good for you!
review/text: I started buying these at Costco (US) but have not been able to find them there or any local store for the alst several months. I ordered these from Amazon and was pleased. The price is a bit more than the price at Costco - due to the shipping charge, but they are worth it because Amazon is the only place I can find these (other than Costco Canada).<br />These little chocolate cookies are heart shaped and tasty with whole grains and little chocolate chips. I eat a bag everyday and used to have minor digestive problems but these help significantly...I know I rather eat tasty chocolate cookies than take pills! Beware not to eat more than one bag a day or eat within a few hours of another high fiber snack (like Fiber One bars) because of the gas high fiber creates..no problem with just one bag a day or spreading the high fiber snacks out several hours. Try these..you and your intestines won't be sorry!

review/summary: Shipping of Syrup
review/text: This company needs to review their shipping practices and their quality control. One the packages arrived with syrup all over the outside as several of the cups had opened and leaked all over. I opened the box to see how bad it was only to discover you can't return them once the package has been opened so I was stuck with a big mess. There were over 10 cups that had opened and gotten all over the inside so I spent an hour cleaning off the ones that could be saved. The product itself tasted very good but it was not worth all the work cleaning up the mess.

At under 2 oz. per cup, you can probably use 1 of these cups for 1-2 pancakes, depending on how much syrup you prefer on your hotcakes.

review/text: As a longtime insomniac, I have tried every potion that claims to induce sleep.  This  is without a doubt the best product I have tried.  It is far better than Celestial Seasonings or Yogi tea.  It tastes pungent, but is strangely alluring.  I used to get this product at several local supermarkets, but they have stopped carrying it.  It is hard to understand why such a good product would not be in greater demand.  I absolutely love this tea and hope others will discover it.  It is a gem!

review/summary: Tried and true, traditional wisdom for you
review/text: The cough suppressant in this product is from menthol (10 mg per cup), which adds a noticeable, cooling medicinal taste to this tea; yet, the taste of this tea is so spicy and aromatic that it isn't "medicinal"...like a cough drop.<br /><br />I've enjoyed this lots of times without cold symptoms.  The aroma is healing too, so it's a tea that you inhale the steam from and feel the clearing of nasal passage.  This formula for cough relief is genuinely "traditional" as the brand name says, and comes from a European (Swiss) recipe/manufactured in Germany, and has a fascinating history described on the box.  It's my opinion this tea is tasty without anything added.  Recommended.<br /><br />FYI on the other ingredients, making for the great taste, but ineffective to your cough: meadowsweet flower, wild thyme, licorice root, plantain leaf, Echinacea, elder flower, oil of peppermint.

review/summary: Was hoping for the best.....
review/text: I drink a good amount of coffee. I buy and try many kinds  and types, mostly whole bean and grind fresh per pot. With some of the more robust roasts, I cannot use the reusable gold filter supplied with the coffee machine because it allows too much acid and oil to remain. This ends up giving me indigestion. I remedy this by using a paper filer instead and it captures enough of the oil and acid to make the brew more enjoyable to my tummy.<br />I thought I would give this a try, broke out the gold filter and brewed up a nice big pot. My first taste sensation was that I had not used enough coffee as it had a weak taste and non existent body. Made another pot with more coffee, but received the same results. The only taste I can compare it to is cheap decaffeinated coffee.<br />I just threw both bags in the trash.I would rather deal with the acidity of regular or just not<br /> drink coffee at all instead of drinking this acid free coffee.<br />If you have to have acid reduced coffee and you must have coffee, then go for it, I guess. Everyone else might want to pass.

review/text: I ordered several different cases of LU cookies to hand out to my husbands coworkers in bundles. It was a perfect, no hassle, tastey gift. By far the most popular were the white chocolate covered short bread cookies; second runner up were the LU Digestive cookies. Don't let the name throw you, these are delicate little cookies coated in creamy chocolate. Over all it was a satisfying purchase. The cases of cookies arrived promptly, the cookies were not broken, and they taste great.

review/text: I love white chocolate. But I have to say, that they should put in the description that the insides of these are not the same as the insides of the regular milk or dark chocolate godiva. Most of them have RASPBERRY OR STRAWBERRY filling. I dont like raspberry or strawberry. I would have much preferred the regular chocolate filling, or caramel/nut filling they have in the milk and dark chocolate pieces.

review/text: Like other reviewers have pointed out, these are not sparkles. They just add a little shimmer. The flakes are large, not glittery. No taste or crunch either. They just kind of fall on icing and look like really thin shards of glass. Not pretty, just shiny purple.

You barely notice their existence, flavor and texture-wise.  They are just for pretty.  And for that, they're great!  The tiny bottle also gives you more glitter than you might think.  I glitterated 18 cupcakes with one half of one bottle.  A great deal!

review/summary: Be cautious!
review/text: I bought this item for it's meal replacement abilities and it does just that- thus the 3 stars. The negative side is that you won't want to eat anything at all after you drink this mix. It took me a few days to realize what it tastes like and I've come to the conclusion that it tastes like vomit. Yes, vomit. I tried the mix in orange juice, water, blueberry juice, cran-grape juice, and both with and without fruits but the taste it the same. It leaves a distinct taste in your mouth that is nearly impossible to get rid so I can only suggest time for the taste to disappear. When drinking the powder, be aware that as you near the end of the drink, you may find tiny flakes that are nearly impossible to avoid regardless of how long you mix the drink. This drink mix has left me gassy and nauseas but since I paid over $30 for the container (which last about 2 weeks when using 1 scoop a day), I'll continue to drink it until it's gone but never again will I buy it. I'm going for pills next time because the taste of this drink mix is sickening but yes, it does replace a meal just as it suggests.

The taste isn't bad at all, though, if you are used to having your Protein Drink sweetened with a lot of sugar or other sweetener, you will be disappointed as this does not taste like a McDonald's Milk Shake.  But the taste is fine.<br /><br />It is hard to underestimate the nutritional value of this product, as in addition to 26 grams of vegan protein, it is loaded with other healthful nutrients.  Each scoop has a pound of dried fruit and a pound of dried vegetables in it, plus a vitamin complex, and enzymes.<br /><br />If you are looking for a really excellent Vegan Protein this is the ticket, plus it serves as a meal replacement and a multi-vitamin.

review/text: I've been reading and studying the benefits of honey and have been purchasing different varieties and brands trying to find one that I like to add to my food regimen.  After tasting Orange Blossom Honey from Florida, I purchased this brand as well as Miller's both from California. Topanga Brand honey is by far the best of all three.  The honey I received is darker in color than the others but has a richer, sweeter taste with a nice citrus scent. I would definitely recommend this honey to my friends and family and will continue to purchase more for myself and to give as gifts to the honey lovers in my family.  This honey is SO VERY GOOD!!!!!

review/summary: Dented cans are not dangerous or bad
review/text: I like chunk light tuna better than albacore for most things. Sometimes things get dented in shipping, we all know mass-shipping is not always kind to products, and if they know it's not breakable like glassware, they are not careful. Anyway, I saw other reviews where people were afraid to eat dented cans, and I had to say something. This is misinformation. It is BULGING cans and/or cans with rusty looking seams that you are not supposed to eat. If it looks like the shipping container got wet, just clean the cans first, as you would do after a flood. I am a health inspector in California. Most people don't know that it is NOT even illegal to sell products past the out-date, at least in this state. Those dates are a guideline and we even license stores called Food Salvagers that sell primarily expired goods at a steep discount. Now I wouldn't necessarily eat expired dairy products, except yogurt with live cultures. And some bottled juices will separate after a very long time (way past the out-date), and the main problem with that is texture. Meat, maybe, depends on how it looks and if it's been frozen, but packaged goods are mostly good for a long time after that date. If it smells rancid or stale, then don't eat it. Oddly enough, saltine crackers are one item that gets really rancid eventually, and I'm talking a long time after the listed date. I get mad when I see grocery store personnel dumping wagon loads of food in dumpsters that are past the out-date when they could be donating them to people in need. But anyway, a can that is dented from shipping is no reason to not eat something. What a waste.

review/summary: What it is....
review/text: As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying "fresh" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh.

review/text: Wolfgang Puck's Chef's Reserve Colombian (Dark Roast) is basically what they said it will be. Dark roast, but not too strong. Acidity is on a low side, but with plenty of pleasant taste. At the same time you can drink this coffee black w/o the need for the sweetener and/or milk. This coffee is in European tradition and will please many people. I would recommend it after dinner, but not if you need a jolt to wake you up.

review/summary: My mom said this was not as flavorful as other "Extra Bolds"
review/text: This is the most USEFUL info you will ever need to know about K-Cups, and one that took me forever to discover:<br /><br />Bold/Extra Bold coffee in terms of k-cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger, it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee.<br /><br />There! Now you know.<br /><br />My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and she's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).<br /><br />Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups she's tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. She's tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.

Bitter aftertaste, and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor. Smells great while brewing, but just does not live up to it in the cup. I'm really disappointed because I now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink! Great price though.

review/text: This Wolfgang Puck coffee tasted great. The vanilla flavoring is just right. Some reviews said it was not so good, not enough flavoring, etc. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews posted on here. I have never posted for a product and I have tried many different k-cups. This is a good k-cup and don't hesitate to purchase this flavor because of the negative feedback. I almost hesitated and didn't buy it and then I figured I would give it a shot. It was worth it to pick the vanilla francaise flavor. You will enjoy it. It tastes better then other k cup vanilla flavors like folgers and van houtte flavor.

Some vanilla, but it mostly tastes like coffee with baileys irish cream in it.<br /><br />In fact, after I drank a cup I had to go pick up my son from kindergarten and it occurred to me that some of the other parents might think I was drinking spiked coffee while we waited for the class to let out! :)<br /><br />But its good.  I recommend it to anyone who likes flavored coffee.  Not really anything else like it and I've tried about 20 different k-cup flavors.

review/summary: Too Mild for Me
review/text: I bought this because Amazon had DRASTICALLY increased the price on what I usually buy, so I thought I'd try something new.  I normally drink Coffee People Donut Shop, which is a nice, strong cup of coffee.  This was a little disappointing.  It's called a Medium Roast, but when I brew a large cup (my Keurig has 3 size options), it looks like strong tea - very light in color.  It makes a very weak cup of coffee.  When I brew the smallest cup possible, it's a tiny bit better, but I prefer a large cup of strong coffee.  Think I may try the Rodeo Drive or Sorrento, but this one is just too weak and light for me.  (Oddly enough, the first time I tried Donut Shop, I thought it was too strong...as I had been used to weaker coffees.  Now that I've started drinking the stronger varieties, it's hard to go back to "brown water.")

If you like a stronger cup in the morning, without being bitter, give this one a try.

What it is saying, based on the photo I see above, is that IF the coffee type you have is straight coffee, then all it contains is 100% arabica coffee...  But IF what you are drinking is a FLAVORED coffee, then the ingredients in it are Arabica coffee, and flavorings...  But IF what you're drinking is a DECAF variety, then it contains Arabica coffee that has been decaffeinated with Ethyl Acetate, as is standard.<br /><br />So if you're not holding a decaf variety, then there is no decaffeinated beans!  It is nothing more than generic catch all ingredients that apply to whichever variety you happen to be looking at.<br /><br />Sheesh.  Think people! lol

review/text: Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. I'm still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself!
