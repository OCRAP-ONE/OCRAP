review/text: These drops taste so much better than any conventional type of hard candy (Lifesavers, those European kinds with the pretty wrappings) it almost seems an insult to compare them. YE's assorted fruit drops are a staple in my cupboard for when I want to satisfy my sweet tooth with something small. Each flavor actually tastes just like the particular fruit it's supposed to taste like (Mango, blood orange, strawberry, etc), and quite powerfully so.

review/summary: Candy you can feel good about!
review/text: In a world where everything is processed and full of GMO's, aftificial flavors and dangerous dyes, it is refreshing to pop these wonderful little candies into your mouth, or that of your child, and know that they are full of truly good ingreients. Not only are they full of good ingredients, but they taste wonderful!!! Each flavor has it's own very individual and unique fruity flavor combination that just tickles your tastebuds. I have 7 children who choose these over other sugared hard candies because they actually taste better! I can't say enough about them. We all love this candy!! The suckers are equally as wonderful too.

review/summary: Surprising Treat
review/text: I was recently at my parents house for a visit when my mom insisted I try one of these new lollipops she got.  I've never been a huge "organic" kinda guy, to me it doesn't make a difference.  My mom however suffers from Crohn's disease, so her doctor insists she eats an organic, non wheat flour, no sugar diet.<br /><br />Instead of "cheating" and having a few sugary treats she found the yummy earth lollipops...after trying all the flavors in the bag she was in love.  I did try cherry, blueberry, and mango.  I gotta admit this things are excellent!  The flavors and sweetness are amazing for a sugar free candy, and even my diabetic dad enjoys them!<br /><br />I ordered the drops on amazon for part of a birthday present for my mom, since she admitted its hard to sit and enjoy a lollipop while at work (between phone calls, meetings, etc).  I think the drops will be perfect for her desk drawer, and easier to enjoy during phone calls, and conference's.<br /><br />I gotta say if you need a sweet fix, these are for you.  Whether you do all organic, no organic, sugar free, etc your gonna love these!

review/text: These are not flavors derived from natural fruits....they are flavor industry created chemicals that can be called "natural" only because of the very very lose definition the FDA allows for flavorings.  These candy's are as bad for you and your kids as is any other hard candy.  These guys are just a fraud or just so stupid that they just don't understand what they are doing.  In either case you are better off just giving your kids some real organic fruit and keeping them from acquiring a taste for this type of trash!

review/summary: HORRIBLE
review/text: My family drinks Ban Lan Gen regularly (of different brands - best deal available). Generally, it tastes GREAT and truly works to ward off colds/flu and make the recovery process much quicker if you are sick. However, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BRAND.  It tastes HORRIBLE, despite the large amount of sugar added.  Bitter, unfamiliar and REALLY BAD taste.  Plus, the packaging is very weak and thin and many of the bags arrived broken and granules make a MESS as they fall out everywhere.

review/text: I have yet to find a Bloody Mary Mix that I consider a home run.  That said, Mrs. T's Bloody Mary Mix, so far, is the best Bloody Mary Mix I have found.  It has a unique tasty flavor and the consistency is very good if you follow the instructions and don't put too much alcohol in your drink.<br /><br />The Bold and Spicy mix is the one to go with.  It has a fuller, spicer flavor than the regular mix.  I still need to spice it up a bit with some hot sauce.  But overall, given other brands on the market, Mrs. T's is a solid choice for a Bloody Mary Mix.

review/summary: A good Bloody Mary mix but you can easily make a Better One
review/text: I have a Virgin Mary every day and a true Bloody Mary maybe once or twice a week. I've experimented with a lot of different tomato juices, hot sauces, and spices but I've only tried a few Bloody Mary mixes.<br /><br />I recently purchased both the Tabasco Spicy Bloody Mary mix and the Mr & Mrs T Spicy Bloody Mary mix to see what (if anything) I was missing. The Tabasco mix was simply horrid but the Mr & Mrs T I felt was pretty good. It has a nice blend of heat versus sweetness (tomatoes working against hot peppers). However any other flavors (if they exist) seemed lost in the Mr & Mrs Ts mix. A true three star product - good but not great. Be advised I suspect this mix may be too hot for some palettes.<br /><br />I'd recommend Mr/Mrs Ts to anyone who MUST purchase a mix. It's a good one. But I don't recommend you purchase any mix!<br />.<br /><br />I'd recommend a simple recipe using just two ingredients - your preferred tomato juice and a good/great hot sauce but the devil, of course, is in the details.<br />.<br /><br />SIMPLE BLOODY MARY RECIPE - Two Ingredients:<br /><br />1.) Tomato Juice or V8 juice - I prefer the low sodium variety of V8 but that is NOT a critical factor. Use whatever juice you like.<br />Actually the lowest priced cans of tomato juice at my local supermarket have proven really excellent! Go figure.<br /><br />2.) A Good Quality Hot Sauce. Using a better than average hot sauce is absolutely key. I strongly recommend (if you do not already have a favorite) one of the following (I've taste tasted about 30 different ones and below is my short list of favorites which are also readily available:<br /><br />  a) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce - This sauce has considerable heat but it is nicely balanced against a bit of sweetness combined  with a hint of garlic. It really makes the virgin/bloody mary quite special. Virtually every supermarket carries it - look in the Asian section!<br /><br />  b) Cholula Original Hot Sauce - features a fine blend of peppers - medium hot and readily available - look in the Mexican section<br /><br />  c) Tapatio Hot Salsa Picanta - another widely distributed and excellent Mexican Hot sauce. Once again you will find this in your Mexican aisle.<br /><br />  d) Tabasco Chipotle hot sauce - a well know national brand. The Chipotle pepper is smoked and has a unique flavor. Commonly available and worth a try. There are many other brands of Chipotle sauces. If you like the taste of this one you are off to the races to see which brand you prefer. But a good place to start is with this Tabasco product.<br /><br />  e) El Yacateco Green<br /><br />That is simple as it gets. A juice and a dash of a really good hot sauce. This is not only far better than the Tabasco mix (which is horrid) but it is also better than the Mr/Mrs Ts Bloody Mary mix! An added bonus of mixing your own ----- you can adjust the heat level to your individual preferences. You can't do that with a mix.<br /><br />Have some fun by adding Worchester sauce, horseraddish, etc

review/text: my first time trying rooibos.<br /><br />This provence rooibos is a great blend, w/both florals, and fruits.  It came with steeping instructions on the back of the resealable flexible foil bag (in chart form, for a few different tea types). It was so good that I ended up drinking the whole 12oz pot (surprising for someone who can usually put away only half that when it comes to hot tea).<br /><br />It had a natural sweet note, n went well paired with a raspberry centered biscuit. I think it will be good for the summer as a refreshing iced tea too!<br /><br />where I bought it:<br />  purchased at enjoyingtea.com along w/a tea sampler and teapot-drip-catchers that I really wanted just to keep the lid on without my having to hold it while pouring.<br />  Everything from the company was nicely packaged, and came in 4days and shipping less than $4. The sampler floral tea came in cute tiny tin-cans; now I can experiment by mixing my own!

review/summary: Weight is incorrect, flavor is bland, product doesn't mix.
review/text: The picture supplied shows a label with "1 pound" printed on it. Under details, the weight is listed as 8 ounces. My order showed "1 pound" as did the order details for feedback. So...3 of 4 details say I should receive a pound. I was a little put off getting half as much. The powder is remarkably void of carob or any flavor. Even adding several heaping spoonfuls didn't provide the flavor of carob expected, let alone intensity of flavor. It was also permanently clumpy. Putting it in hot or cold water, hot or warm coffee, hot or cold milk, nothing changed that it clumps up around the sides or bottom of the glass. Stirring for 5 minutes, letting it stand, stirring more, still Clumpsville.<br />  I want to say something nice about the product, but there isn't much. I ordered 3 other items from Barry Farms, one of them being carob chips. THOSE had the flavor I was expecting, (and came in the one pound size advertised), and all items were packed well and shipped quickly. It's this product that needs work.<br />  If you want half an order of bland, clumpy powder, order this. Otherwise, pass on it, and get their carob chips (sweetened) if you want carob flavor.

review/text: I remember my grandmother always carrying around candies in a tin shaped like raspberries or something. I purchased these since they looked similar. They aren't fruit-shaped but are round and are very much smaller than the ones I remember (little smaller than the end of my pinky finger). The three flavors do taste similar, but you can distinguish them from one another. I did like that they weren't too sweet like most of the hard candy you find in the store. Plenty of candies in a tin, would purchase again and recommend to others who want slightly sweet and flavorful hard candy.

review/summary: Good savings but seems rather mushy
review/text: I did the subscribe and save option because my kids ate this all the time in their lunches.  Not many stores around here have the Healthy Request version and it is usually $1.80 somthing.  This is a great savings, not only in the unit price but with the free shipping.  I have noticed though that the noodles seem to be pretty mushy.  I have not purchased any from the store lately so be able to compare but I don't like it myself.  The kids still eat it so I have just reduced the frequency of my shipments without completely cancelling them.  Great idea, okay product.

review/summary: Mmmm, Mmmm, Good!!!
review/text: Campbell's Healthy Request Chicken Noodle Soup has been a principle staple in my diet for many years. It is tasty, savory, quick & easy, and I get the benefit of less sodium & fat. Sometimes, when available, I dice up some cooked chicken & more carrots to make a more substantial meal. Either way, I enjoy!<br /><br />As to getting deliveries of my beloved soup from Amazon, the savings are HUGE!!! Locally, the grocery stores here charge up to $1.79 per can -- OUCH!!! For the price of 2 cans, I can get 3+ -- and the ratio gets even better with each case!<br /><br />Adding in the incredible benefit of having the soup delivered to my door makes me an especially happy camper. I don't have to go out to the store when I'm low or out -- a real plus for me as I'm disabled & get around using a mobility scooter. This frees up some space for me on my scooter when I do go to a store, which allows me more freedom in my purchases on those trips.<br /><br />Taking advantage of the subscription service is a real win-win for me. There is just one thing I'd do differently if I made the decisions for Amazon: don't limit the selections to monthly choices. Instead, allow for weekly choices as I'd prefer to get a case automatically delivered every week or so, rather than manually ordering 3-4 per month (by ordering an extra shipment every week or so, which I've been doing lately) -- I don't have the space for 3-4 cases at a time, but getting one case automatically delivered on a weekly basis would be ideal. Hope you're reading this, Amazon -- I sure would love automatic weekly deliveries (hint, hint)...

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: The soup is very tasty. I add flavor with dried parsley flakes, celery seed and lots of pepper. This is the second time I've received a shipment of Campbells's Healthy Choice Chicken Noodle soup. I am reluctant to order it again since almost every can was dented in the last batch. That said, I wish Amazon carried the Homestyle chicken noodle soup. I like that better as the noodles are smaller and firmer.

review/summary: Awful, please bring back the original version!
review/text: It seems Campbell's has discontinued the regular Homestyle chicken noodle (We cannot find it in any grocery store or online).  They now only offer the healthy request and low sodium options.<br /><br />I bought this healthy request version by mistake thinking it was the original and it tasted awful, very bland and tasteless!  It was like eating noodle water.  We tried adding salt, etc, but this did not help.<br /><br />The original Homestyle Chicken Noodle was a regular staple in our home, but none of us can stand this new bland healthy request version.  There is only a difference of 10 calories!! Not worth it, especially since we don't have health, weight, or sodium issues!<br /><br />I can understand offering healthier options for those who need/want it, but I'm so disappointed that Campbell's has discontinued the original. I cannot recommend this bland soup.

review/summary: Decent amount of clams, very bland taste
review/text: I was surprised by the amount of clam chunks -- usually, they try to save money by putting in a couple of chunks and calling it "clam chowder." It's not a TON of chunks, but it's an average-ish amount.<br />What I couldn't get over though, was the incredibly bland taste. The ingredients confirm that all the thickening is produced entirely with cornstarch and water. It has a very blah-cornstarchey taste. Gross.

review/summary: One flavor was rancid.
review/text: I ordered this as a gift for someone.  5 of the teas smelled OK, but one of them smelled rancid, like oils gone bad.  Adagio does not provide a telephone number for customer service.  Everything is by e-mail so I wrote.  They did not respond so I wrote AGAIN.  I finally did get a response which was: nobody else has complained.  I don't feel this is a decent answer.  They should have opened up the bin of tea in question and taken a whiff for themselves.  I feel that would have been a more appropriate response.

review/summary: my favorite salt
review/text: Baleine salt is my favorite. I use the fine every day and the coarse for a final touch/crunch. No complaints - it's the only brand of salt I use. My only problem is that when Amazon ships the salt, usually half of the containers' lids have popped off and salt is everywhere and I have to find an alternative container for all the loose salt! Amazon, be careful when you're packing it, please!

They finally got on of these bacon flavored ones and were weireded out by them. I tried one and realized why, they're horrible, very minimally taste like bacon, I wasn't expecting them honestly to taste great, but these just had some weird after taste to them.<br /><br />They're a good gag gift, but don't expect them to get eaten after everyone finds out what they taste like.<br /><br />They almost taste like thay came out of the pigs balloon knot...

The number of smaller packages made it easier for people to take a pack and not feel icky about hygiene whereas one large package in the baskets might have had that effect.  But of course, it's well-packaged gum so many people shared the other 4 sticks in the little pack which made this work out perfectly!

review/summary: Tasty, not too sweet
review/text: My great grandmother used to bring these to my mom's house when she was younger and they've become kind of a family tradition. Mom couldn't find them for decades, but the internet came through for us! They are small, almost cube-shaped, hard coffee-flavored candies. They're not too sweet, and they don't really get sticky, either. They just melt nicely in your mouth and have a wonderful rich flavor. Love them!

review/text: Someone gave me one of these one day and I just had to purchase some. I soon found that they are imported and not at the local candy shop.<br />They are coffee flavored and kind of creamy but no filling in them.<br />Good candies if you are a coffee fan.<br />They were sold out and I had to wait several more weeks to get them so they get a four star.

review/summary: Not so addictive.
review/text: I bought these on a Lightening deal. With Easter coming up I thought I'd have an inexpensive treat for the over 12 yr set. This is the 'you get what you pay for scenario.' The chocolate is waxy and too sweet. That said not horribly waxy but certainly undistinguished. You can get much better chocolate in grocery stores and drugstores these days. The Macadamia nuts are also inferior. While not a connoisseur my past experience is that the high fat content gives them a distinctive tooth and mouth feel that is not present here. The only flavor I noticed was the cheap chocolate. I will update this once others have sampled it.

review/text: The tiny nuts under the overwhelming ball of chocolate is not of the highest quality. They looked a bit old and you can barely taste the macadamias. Too much chocolate that isn't very rich, and for a dark chocolate, way too sweet. You are better off buying roasted Macadamias and a good quality dark chocolate and eating them together in one bite.

I guess if you like mostly all chocolate and a little nut then you might like these.

review/summary: Very good candy
review/text: It is a wonderful nibble, especially if what you want is a chocolate snack.  They have a lot of chocolate around that nut - sometimes, they are round balls of chocolate almost an inch across, surrounding the center.  I enjoy the fact that it isn't just a slight coating, it is a hunk of chocolate.<br />It isn't the greatest chocolate, but it is very good.  And I eat a lot of chocolate.<br />These please me with their taste, and because I can eat 4-5 of them and my craving for chocolate is satisfied.<br />I ordered them on the lightning deal, but will be re-ordering them.

review/summary: So rich, creamy & good, I put it on Subscribe & Save!
review/text: My first purchase was the assortment (milk choc, rich choc and milk choc w/marsmallows) but not for my use. I was planning ahead and wanted to add some of the packets with each Christmas gift I was giving to homes with children. Snowman 'tea' pots with matching snowman mugs, complete with 'lids' or heads with top hats. I also wanted some of envelopes of instant soup & noodles to throw into the empty pot just to show that the 'tea' pot wasn't actually for the adults' use or just for tea, but more for the kids after school snacks. No 'boiling water' for the cocoa; just hot water, stir and drink. However, I would never give a gift of an item I hadn't tasted myself, so I did. Now, I'm hooked. My favorite is the Rich Chocolate because if/when I do eat chocolate, it has to be dark, dark, dark. This 'rich' choice is heavenly. I did like the other two varieties also, the milk chocolate and the milk chocolate with the tiny marshmallows (that actually look like 2mm pebbles, but they are white and they do float...)<br /><br />In any event, I liked this stuff so much that I even tried mixing 2 flavors: i.e., milk choc and the rich - still good. Needless to say, I am back here to order more (and put it on Subscribe and Save) as the colder weather is coming and this is going to be a nice break from all the tea I drink.<br /><br />Pour envelope (or two) into a cup/mug. (One envelope requires only 3/4 Cup hot water, so if you're looking for an adult-sized coffee mug full, use two envelopes and double the water). I don't even measure the water anymore: just two envelopes and fill my mug about 3/4" from the top. I like using a whisk to mix it up because it creates a bit of froth on the top that sticks to my upper lip and brings back great childhood memories!<br /><br />The powder dissolves rather easily, so even a young child could probably make his/her own that is not too hot to drink immediately. This is rich, creamy hot chocolate and I'm going to keep it on hand from now on. As with any hot chocolate, the chocolate does settle to the bottom of the mug, so one must keep stirring unless you are drinking it down in one gulp, so keeping a spoon handy is recommended.

So great, in fact, that we had a second cup and were sitting back and enjoying a leisurely sip and chat on a lazy Sunday morning.  I happened to glance on the ingredient list and saw it contained, hydrogenated coconut oil.  What a recipe for clogged arteries, high density cholesterol and heart attack potential.  If those things don't bother you, go ahead and order a bunch because it does taste teally good.

review/summary: Great flour for gluten-free cooking!
review/text: I have previously purchased smaller bags of Bob's Red Mill Potato Flour from specialty health food stores. I was pleased to find this item available in larger 24-ounce bags, and in a lot of 4 bags! I have found that this is a great flour for gluten free baking and cooking. I mix it in a 1:1 ratio with rice flour and substitute the mix for wheat flour in many recipes. I can finally make decent cookies and other items with this flour! Bob's Red Mill products are high quality, and this potato flour was no exception. It arrived fresh, with a great flavor.

review/summary: So good, I don't want to tell you about it!
review/text: I'm reluctant to share all the recipes of things we're using Bob's Red Mill potato flour for. Why? Because they're so good, once people try them, it might start selling out!<br /><br />Oh, what the heck. You talked me into it. I'll share a couple of them anyway.<br /><br />For delicious gluten/grain-free chicken nuggets:<br /><br />Start with a pound of skinless, boneless chicken, cut into nugget-sized pieces. We use dark meat, because it comes out moister and more flavorful. Pat the pieces with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.<br /><br />Next, combine the following in a quart-size Zip Lock bag. You can adjust the seasonings to your own taste, of course:<br /><br />1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp Bob's Red Mill potato flour<br />1 tsp salt<br />1 tsp onion powder<br />1/2 tsp garlic powder<br />1/2 tsp paprika<br />1/2 tsp white or black pepper<br />1/2 tsp dried parsley flakes, crushed to powder<br /><br />Put half the chicken pieces in the bag, zip it closed and toss gently to coat the chicken. Remove the chicken pieces, shaking off the excess coating back into the bag, and cook them in a little oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.<br /><br />It's important to cook over medium-low heat like that, because potato flour can scorch. Using tongs or a fork, turn the pieces occasionally until lightly browned and cooked through. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces.<br /><br />Once you try chicken made with potato flour like this, you may never want chicken made with wheat flour again. :)<br /><br />For a quick and easy, dairy-free, gluten-free, tapioca-like pudding -- yes, pudding:<br /><br />Bring 1-and-a-half cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add a pinch of salt and 1/4 tsp baking soda to the water. (The baking soda will neutralize the potato "tang" of potato flour.) Add a generous dash of vanilla extract.<br /><br />In a small bowl, use a fork to stir together a quarter cup plus 2 tbsps of white sugar, and a quarter cup plus 1 tbsp of Bob's Red Mill potato flour.<br /><br />Remove the saucepan from the heat (this is important -- you don't want the thickening mixture to boil and spatter on you). Gradually pour the dry ingredients from the bowl into the hot water, stirring the water with a fork to mix while you do. The mixture will thicken instantly.<br /><br />(No matter how much you stir, there will be some lumps. So if you don't like lumps, either don't bother with this recipe, or take an extra step of pushing the mixture through a sieve.)<br /><br />Allow the pudding to cool. We usually hasten that process by placing the saucepan in a sink half filled with cold water.<br /><br />We also use potato flour as an extender for wheat-free meat loaf, and as an extender and coating for chicken-fried steak. (Cook in a skillet with a little oil over medium low heat so the potato flour doesn't scorch.)<br /><br />We also ---<br /><br />Okay, I'm not going to tell you any more. I've said too much already. Now don't go buying up all my Bob's Red Mill potato flour!

But, outside of that, this is less tasty than using potato flakes and grinding them to a powder.  And, my potato flake bread came out fluffier than my potato flour bread as well.<br /><br />But, this is easier to deal with, and for time consuming tasks, it is worthwhile.

I found Amazon to be the best way to do this.  I have found the flour to store well and it saves me money buying in bulk and gives me the variety needed.  I use potato flour much like the potato starch so it's used often in my recipes.  It has done well for my cooking needs. With gf flour, the bags are small and if you cook or bake much, the bulk buying will be beneficial.

If you order from this seller, be aware that their shipping costs are high and extremely high if you order just one or two items - making it not worth buying anything unless you buy quite a few things at once.
