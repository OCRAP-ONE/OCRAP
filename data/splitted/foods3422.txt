review/summary: ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! STAY FAR AWAY
review/text: Thanks to this horrible deodorant, I have damaged over 20 shirts of mine. This deodorant works great and does the job, however you soon realise that all your shirts are becoming damaged. You will notice large yellow stains under the arms of the shirt, where you applied the deodorant. These stains DO NOT come out and your shirts will be permanently damaged. This is one of the worst products I have ever used. Stay far away from this horrible product or risk losing all your favorite shirts.

review/summary: Dry As A Bone
review/text: When participating in the daily rat race, it is always a bonus to stay cool, calm, collected.  Needless to say, one does not feel cool, calm, nor collected when perspiration and pesky odor are in keen evidence.  (To the contrary, that's when one feels hot, agitated, and dis-combobulated.)  I prefer the former to the latter, which is why, for many years, I've used DEGREE MEN DRY ANTI-PERSPIRANT & DEODORANT, COOL COMFORT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN.<br /><br />This stuff glides on easy and clear, is non-irritating, and has a pleasing smell.  More importantly, this stuff works, folks; the anti-perspirant and deodorant protect, hour after hour--and all with soothing comfort (because it contains Aloe Vera).  No perspiration stains.  No BO.  No yucky rash.  It's Cool Comfort, baby.<br /><br />What I don't like is once most of the deodorant bar is used, and you're twisting up what remains, it tends to break apart in flakes and slivers and chunks.  Why?  I don't know.  But for the most part, that's a small price to pay to stay cool, calm, collected.  DEGREE MEN DRY ANTI-PERSPIRANT & DEODORANT, COOL COMFORT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN.  Dry is cool.<br />--D.

review/summary: great for travel, do not contain BPA
review/text: First off, the bottles DO NOT contain BPA. The lids are coated in an epoxy that does, but there is another layer over that to help protect the BPA from getting to the formula. I actually called Similac's parent company to verify this.<br /><br />Yes they are expensive, but I get coupons all the time from Similac and use those to buy these bottles. They are wonderful for camping, fishing, or any other time sanitation may be an issue. All you have to do is attach your own nipple and ring. Much less to wash.<br /><br />Though they are really not made to do it, you can punch out the center from the ring and put in a standard nipple. It seems like it will leak, but it doesn't. Then you can just throw the whole thing away.

No washing bottles at the hotel or needing a refrigerator or cooler.  I reccomend that you buy a 3 pack of those super cheap evenflo bottles just to use the nipple and ring.  We bought a pack of these for $2.99 and use the rings/nipples everytime since our Avent ones don't fit.  Love these ready to feed bottles!!

review/text: These bottles are great because they completely eliminate the need to measure and mix formula, and you never have to wash another bottle. (I use them with disposable nipples). My baby likes them too; he actually seems to prefer the ready-to-feed Similac over the Similac I mixed myself. Bottles are also especially useful for travel. I'm serious when I say they are almost as convenient as breastfeeding. Extra time is always golden when you have small children, so if you need to bottle-feed, these are definitely worth the price!

review/summary: Great product, but pricey on Amazon
review/text: This product is great to throw in the diaper bag for on the go feedings.  I bought it from Amazon and then read the reviews it can be purchased cheaper at Target.  It is $9.99 for a 6 pack at Target, so Amazon is cheaper by $4, plus you get the convenience of it shipping to your house.  If you register on Similac's website, they will send you $5 vouchers which can be used in store.  With the $5 vouchers, each 6 pack $5, bringing the Target total to $20 instead of the Amazon's $36.  Also, I took the advice of another poster and bought the cheap Evenflo bottles to reuse the nipples ($3 for a 3 pack).  Definitely a great suggestion as the disposables are $1 each.

review/text: My daughter loves this stuff. Convent to toss into the diaper bag and great for the earthquake kit. When I have this in stock (My wife goes through this stuff pretty quickly) we usually give this to our (now) 3 month old right before her nap or when she's supposed to go to sleep. It's a little thicker than the powder stuff so it fills her tummy pretty well. I have also noticed she doesn't spit up that much when we use this stuff.

review/summary: Ideal for traveling
review/text: Those bottles are ideal for traveling. Unlike the 2 oz bottles, they don't come with a ring and nipple. However the same ring and nipple fits both bottles. Since my baby only likes silicon nipples, I use the Evenflo ring and nipple and they fit well.<br />If you're not using the Similac nipple, avoid twisting the ring too tight, to allow some air to enter the bottle as baby is drinking, and you need to interrupt baby's drinking every now and then to let air in the bottle. However if you're using the original Similac ring and nipple, baby can drink non stop as the air enters the bottle regularly (Similac nipple has holes designed for that). Hope this helps!

review/summary: I love it
review/text: I'm a working mom who wants to keep breast feeding but couldn't catch up with my baby's growing appetite. She eats about 21 ounces per day. I give her about 15 ounces breast milk, the rest of it is formula. The powder formula must be finished within a month once the bottle is opened. This produce is convenient and the size is good for us. It's like one bottle a day. It's a little bit pricy but since my daughter mainly has breast milk, it's still affordable.

review/summary: Great for supplementing
review/text: Our six month old is only using about 8 ounces of formula a day so the larger bottles are no good for us.  The size of the 8oz bottle is perfect, can easily be used with a stand size nipple right on the bottle and is easy to transport.  Our baby does much better on the ready-to-feed verses the powder, I think that is because the consistency is a bit thicker which settles in her stomach easier.  Perfect if you are having to supplement in small amounts because of breastfeeding.

review/summary: Great for breastfeeding moms
review/text: I hate pumping and rarely get more than 3 ounces at a time.  When I started working part time and going out on a date night again, we didn't have quite enough breastmilk to last the day.  This has been such a help.  8 oz portions are great for supplementing, as you use what you need all at once and don't have so much waste (the larger ready to feed bottles need to be used in 48 hours, and the powder needs to be used in 1 month).  These bottles are the perfect size for those sporadic uses/supplementation.  Great for the diaper bag too now that baby is too distracted to breast feed outside of the house.  Fits perfectly in the pocket of the diaper bag, and you can buy the nipples that just attach to the bottle.<br /><br />Our son who was breastfeeding exclusively prior to using this has taken to the formula well and doesn't seem to mind the taste.  We use it to mix with his rice cereal and oatmeal too.

review/summary: Emergency car kit must-have!!!
review/text: The Similac bottled formula is what you will find in my emergency car kit. I breastfeed at home and on the go but a situation arose that I was not able to nurse our son Henry. We were stuck in traffic and were nowhere near an exit. Thankfully this was in the ECK and I was able to open one up, place a disposable nipple and feed the hungry baby. The formula when sealed after the first use can be stored for a few hours in the refrigerator or cooler. This formula did not have an awkward foul odor or color. The option to be able to use inexpensive disposable nipples is wonderful.<br /><br />To sum it up, this product does what it intends to do. Provide a sterile, simply, and convenient method of feeding baby on the go.

Similac Advance early shield gives my precious gift everything he need as far as nutrition. My daughter lives out of town and we travel back and forth a lot.  The ready to feed is just that, ready when you need it.  The price is comparable to what is in the store.  I order and it is practically there instantly (a day or 2 at the most)and  it allows me to order and send directly to them.  It's my way of helping out and being of help when I am not there.

review/text: The baby had a bit of reflux and this formula helped him.It is sterile, homogeneously mixed and ready to feed. The only draw back I see with it is that if your child does not drink 8oz at once, you need to refrigerate the left over formula(this happens for us and we just put it in the refrigerator). I sometimes use evenflo glass bottle collar with nuk orthodontic thin neck nipples.It works fine.

review/summary: Only formula will buy & very satisfied!
review/text: Similac Advance Early Shield w/ Iron Ready to Eat is the best.  I have absolutlely no complaints about it except the cost.  Yes, they cost more, but it is for convenience.  We actually tried powder to be more cost effective & didn't have as good experience with them keeping it down (spitting up).  I can count on one hand the number of times at not keeping this ready to feed formula down & that says a lot if you have a sensitive eater.  I know several babies w/ food allergies/sensitivities/eczema that do well with this.  It is also important that it has the iron.  Similac has been around a long time & I have nothing but good to say about it.  To be able to just grab these @ anytime & not have to heat/etc. is wonderful - SERIOUSLY, wonderful.  Just shake, open & feed (if still on the bottle put on a nipple or pour into a bottle).  Always make sure to check the seal on each indidual bottle.  We haven't had many issues, but when you go through this many bottles a day it can happen that maybe one was dropped/not sealed.  No need to worry about it, but for any brand this is something I feel is important.<br /><br />Amazon offers a competitive price as I've purchased from numerous places.<br /><br />Hopefully the price will come down in the future as more go to using ready to feed.  Afterall, this is what hospitals provide after birth so it has to be healthy.  After the 2010 recall on powdered formula, the ready to feed bottles flew out of stock everywhere & I think a lot of those that maybe wouldn't have tried it were forced to & liked it.  If more utilize the ready to feed cost will come down eventually - fingers crossed!!!<br /><br />I give this product 5 stars.

review/summary: Very easy and tastes good too.
review/text: My baby breastfed but eventually I needed to supplement.  I tried several different formulas and my baby just did not like them.  I read somewhere that the Similac Ready to Feed tasted better than other formulas and didn't have a grainy texture like the powders.  I decided to do a taste test myself and I too found that it had a pleasant taste (a little sweet like breastmilk) and did not have a bad smell like the powders.  So I began feeding my baby 1/2 formula and 1/2 breastmilk and he took it without any problem.  After a few weeks of that process I was able to move to 100% formula.  The ready to feed really is very simple to use and take along with you.  I'd say it's almost as easy as breasfeeding.  I wish it came in a 4 oz size rather than an 8 oz size.  The 2oz size is not enough (and way more expensive) and the 8oz is too much.  It's fine when I'm at home and can refrigerate the extra but when I'm out and about the extra often gets wasted.<br /><br />But other than that I'm really happy with this product.  With Amazon Prime and Free 2 Day shipping it's a great value too.

review/summary: Paying extra for convenience.
review/text: I buy these for the times when I am in a serious rush- just toss a few in the diaper bag along with some standard size nipples and rings and I can be out the door in a flash.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Fast and easy.<br />-I don't have to worry about them leaking all over my expensive diaper bag.<br />-I don't have to keep them refrigerated.<br />-The bottles are compact, so I can fit more in my bag vs. large bottles with water in them plus a container of  powdered formula.<br />-No washing bottles, only nipples and rings.  I stocked up on Evenflo and Gerber cheap plastic bottles and I have more nipples and rings than I know what to do with.<br />-Toss it out when you're done, so your diaper bag gets lighter and easier to zip as the day wears on.<br />-I think they even make disposable nipples for these, not sure though.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Very expensive compared to powder (and even more so compared to breastmilk- stupid school schedule making me dry up.)<br />-Unless you want to carry around another bottle to empty some of it into before the feeding, you have to use it right away, no refrigerating leftovers.  My son rarely eats 8 ounces at one feeding, so we waste 2-3 ounces per bottle.<br /><br />Overall, I think that they are prohibitively expensive when it comes to everyday feedings, but the cost is worth the convenience for the occasional outing.

review/summary: Leakage issues.
review/text: The Ready to feed idea is great. I recently travelled with my twins on a long flight (almost 20 hrs). It was very helpful especially with two babies. But, it leaked with my regular Dr.Brown's nipples. I was kind of disappointed because it would spill all over my kids's neck. It kind of worked by holding the bottle at a certain angle sometimes. It would be best if it came with disposable nipples. On the return flight I poured the RTF formula into my regular Dr.Brown's bottles and fed my babies. This way there was no leakage. I didn't like the idea of carrying many Dr.Brown's bottles to prevent leakage but atleast I didnt have to prepare formula on the flight with two babies. I would definitely recommend buying these RTF and maybe try it with different nipples.On similac's website I saw that they had disposable nipples but not sure if those would fit these.

review/summary: Convenient but BPA issue
review/text: I loved these since they are so convenient.  I hate powder formula since I always have problems with clumps and they are messy.  It was so nice to just open one of these rather having to mix and shake and get powder all over the place.  And they carry so well....alas, due to the BPA chemical leaching issue, I switched to powder again.  I hope they switch to BPA free containers.

review/summary: Unclear bottle count
review/text: I like the similac formula bottles.  However, I was looking to find these bottles for a lower price through Amazon, so I came to order these bottles.  My understanding from the way the product was described is that there were 24 cases of 6 bottles, not 24 bottles total.  At 24 bottles total (which is what I received), this is a worse price than what I pay at my grocery store (which is the most expensive place I have bought them).

review/summary: This milk makes our baby really sick!! :(
review/text: Sorry to give this 1 star. but this milk really makes our baby really sick!! :(, literally!!<br />if your baby can take it, I guess it's a good one but for us, we had the worst experience with it.<br /><br />Here is our story.<br />My baby had been solely breastfed. After 9 months my wife was running short of her milk. She didn't have enough breastmilk for the baby and he didn't take as much solid food as we would want him to.<br />We gave him Similac Advance, it was recommended by the hospital. First Similac Advance Liquid, he threw up 9 times within 2 hours after half an hour of feeding. That happened twice. A few days later, we tried Similac Advance power, he threw up again! This time 5 times plus serious diarrhea for 5 days. He has lost 5% of his weight within 2 days. That's really bad.<br /><br />We were desperate. We took him to the hospital twice that week. The doctor though it was stomach flu.<br />However, I didn't quit agree with him. What a coincident that 2 different formula milk feeding incidents would throw my baby off balance. I'm a computer engineer and dealing with solving and debugging problems all the time.<br />I was firm with the doctor that this was not a coincident. I thought it might have something to do with the protein in the formula that my baby couldn't digest. We decided to try Lactose free formula (Nutramigen from Enflora). It smell and taste really awful (my wife tried it and she gagged.<br />As we thought, my baby rejected to drink it. Then I tried Good Start soy. Same story, smell bad but not as bad as Nutromigen. My baby also rejected to drink it.<br /><br />Now we were really desperate, not enough milk for him and he doesn't like to eat solid food!! He would throw up + diarrhea if he gave him normal formula milk. Phone call to 4 advise nurses, no luck! I finally search on the internet and found a lot of similar story to what we experienced (including this on Amazon reviews).<br />I decided to give it a final try, crossing our fingers really tight. Good Start Gentle Plus is our last hope or my baby would not have any more milk to drink. He's losing weight!!<br /><br />And then miracle happened!!! This milk works wonderfully for him. The only complain I would have is that it doesn't smell as good as the normal cow milk-based formula, however, doesn't smell or taste awful like the other two.<br /><br />My baby didn't quite used to the tasted in the beginning and didn't really want to drink it at first. So we tried mixed it with breastmilk for a few days.<br /><br />Now he is a happy baby, gaining weight, doesn't throw up and used to the taste of it.<br />My wife and I are now happy again :)

review/text: This coffee was recommended to me by a friend and fellow coffee-holic. From the moment I opened the bag and smelled this beautiful roast - I knew I was going to love the flavor. Although I'm not a coffee aficionado, I drink many different types and I know good coffee when I taste it. The Vida Helsar is smooth yet distinctive and perfect for anyone who loves a good cup(s) - and it's organic.

review/summary: Love This Coffee!
review/text: I just tried this coffee, as I enjoy experimenting with different products. I am really enjoying it from several perspectives: 1) It had a really different taste than what one normally gets from most store-bought coffee, 2) it not at all oily...many coffees are overly roasted to hid inferior quality...no need to over-roast this coffee as it stands tall on its own -- you can see the lack of oil by how the coffee comes out of the grinder cleanly, and 3) we like supporting both organic, sustainable farming, as well as local boutique businesses.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is coffee we really enjoy, especially on leisurely weekend mornings, and it is now on our short list of most-favored coffees.  Highly recommended without reservation!

review/summary: Amazingly Good Apple Sauce
review/text: I have tried many apple sauce varieties over the years, including virtually all non-organics in my younger years, and I have been through the gamut of the organic apple sauce offerings. Through them all, this one clearly comes out on top and it is the only one I buy. It is a brilliant mixture of the classic apple sauce taste with a twist of peach flavoring. The peach is stronger than the apple sauce flavor, but it has a freshness to it. It is sweeter than the average apple sauce, but much more flavorful. Definitely give this one a shot, nothing beats it cold and it's only 60 calories per cup with only organic ingredients.

Ella's fruit purees are much better, but these peach-applesauce cups are better than most applesauce cups.  The peach flavor tastes a little artificial.  The texture is very smooth with no lumps.

In a short period of time, the mixture freezes into a cold and slushy and thoroughly delicious drink. Each pouch makes a half-gallon, about 16 servings (or better yet, make it 12 or less servings!).<br /><br />This is a really great idea. The pouches are dead easy to take along dry, and still quite convenient when filled and ready to drink. Try it, you'll like it!<br /><br />(Review of Lt.

review/text: I was excited to get these.  I was going to a frozen drink party and wanted something different that no one else would have.  These seemed ideal.  Unfortuantely, they were a HUGE bust!  They were WAY too sweet- bordered upon undrinkable.  And even though there was wine in them, they froze completely solid.  So, in order to drink them, they had to sit out for an hour or more to thaw.  Then they thawed too much and were just a soupy mess.  I am stuck with two more packages as I bought the three pack.  I had high hopes and was extremely let down.  They ended up being a huge waste of money.  :(

review/text: I tried the Sangria Wine Freezer because I really liked the margarita and the mojito mixes. And the verdict is.....too bad I bought it in a pack of 3, as I don't know what to do with what's left over. It's too sweet, and doesn't have any exciting flavour. Also, unlike the mixes made with hard liquor, the wine freezes too hard, so it's tough to get it out of the bag once frozen. I had to leave it out of the freezer for an hour or more so I could pour/squeeze a drink!

review/text: We ordered the onions packed in balsamic vinegar already being fans of veggies and salads with balsamic vinegar. This is the first time tasting this product and have no experience of other versions of this Italian delicacy with which to compare it. So, we're not sure how this might measure up to with other similar products which may or may not be better.<br /><br />I was hoping for something that my guests would enjoy more, but the product was good. We just served cold as a side dish but would be very good in salads. The over all taste is balsamic, of course, but onions are quite sweet and reasonably crisp. I enjoyed them. We did not try any of the pastry presentations which would have been very good, I'm sure. Other reviewers will be able to offer better comparisons.

review/summary: This stuff really works!
review/text: Deer Off really does keep deer, woodchucks and rabbits from eating our garden plants, shrubs and trees.  It works winter and summer in our semi-rural southern Wisconsin location.  Rain will wash it off, but usually applying it every few weeks does the trick.<br />I recommend using the concentrate.  Keep the bottle in your refrigerator.  No, it won't make your 'frige stink!  We mix it up as needed and spray it with an inexpensive plastic pressurized sprayer.  Diluted concentrate in the sprayer does not spoil, but will freeze in the winter as it is water-based.<br />The concetrate seems expensive, but it's much cheaper than buying the pre-mixed version.  Just a light application on each plant is all that's needed to be effective.

review/summary: great product
review/text: I have been using this product for approximately 3 years.  It definitely fends off any critters (large or small) from eating your plants.  The solution is very strong, so I use it mainly on flowers and shrubs as opposed to vegetables and or fruits.  I imagine it would be ok to use on edibles, depending on the permeability of their skin, however this is one marinade I would absolutely pass on.  The residual effects of the application last for quite a long period, at least 6 weeks to 2 months.

review/summary: Repels Deer
review/text: I wanted a deer repellent that was nontoxic and didn't rely on predator urine. After reading test results of various products, I tried Deer Off. It does work - we have herds of deer that come through my suburban yard, and it saved my hosta flowers this year (deer ate every single one before I got Deer Off). The problem is that I have to remember to keep a supply of it onhand, because if I don't use it every six weeks or so, it eventually wears off. It can also be hard on your sprayer. The handles broke on the two spray bottles I used, so I started using a pump sprayer. I have to filter the concentrate, because it can clog the sprayer with little bits. I combine it with some liquid kelp and fertilize the plants at the same time.<br /><br />I don't know about squirrels or rabbits, because even though we have them, they don't cause much damage to my shade garden.

review/text: I have a terrible deer problem in my garden. Vegetables and flowers can be devastasted overnight and they trample the gardens too, sometimes laying down and crushing large plants. They will eat every daylily bud and tomato plant I have.  I spray this on once a month [more if it rains a lot] and they really don't touch the plants. I bought a large sprayer type cannister with a pump and mixed a large batch and use it as needed over the summer.  It is 100% effective for me.

review/summary: Der off repellent
review/text: Deer Off deer, rabbit and squirrel repellent may actually repel deer if you can get the repellent on the plants. I carefully followed the dilution instructions, poured the mixture into a sprayer, and started to use it. Within a few minutes the sprayer was clogged. I ended up putting the mixture into a sprinkling can and sprinkling it on the plants -- a very inefficient way to use it. I tried to clean the sprayer and finally had to throw it away. It was a sprayer I had used successfully with other sprays. I would not buy this product again.

review/summary: Disappointing Grape Flavor Not As Tasty as Other Switch Flavors
review/text: Since my teenagers really liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, we thought we would try the Grape Flavor.  We were disappointed. Although still drinkable, it is just not the equal of other flavors of Switch.<br /><br />The positive is that the beverage is all-natural, and packaged in the smaller-than-regular-12-ounce soda cans. It also has less carbonation than regular grape soda, which is a nice change.  But the negative is that the Grape flavor cannot hold a candle to the the two other flavors we have enjoyed.  It is on the sour side and leaves a slight unpleasant aftertaste.  Not at all the satisfying, smooth and true fruit taste of the other two Switch flavors which we have tried.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this flavor, although I still like the brand and plan to sample some other flavors.  I would definitely order the Tangerine/Orange and the Black Cherry again.

review/text: I got this on a Gold Box deal and thought I'd give it a try wanting to get away from soda's and artificial flavors.<br />I am pleasantly surprised. To me it tastes like the non-alcholic sparkling juices you see around the holidays. It still has sugar and calories but it is from 100% fruit juice not high fructose corn syrups like soda's. The serving size is just right.<br /><br />It is a bit pricey so for me, but on subscribe and save for 6mos. apart it will be a special treat. I may try another flavor in the future if they offer it again. Give it a try, nice light grape taste with a twist of bubbles.

review/text: We noticed these drinks in the refrigerated case at Whole Foods and decided to try the grape and cherry which ended up being our family favorites.  The size is perfect for us, as even a 12-ounce can is too large. I had not enjoyed soda much in recent years due to no nutritional value, but since this soda is basically carbonated fruit juice, I can enjoy the tingle of soda with the wholesomeness of the ingredients; the best of both worlds.  After finding out that Whole Foods no longer stocks this product, we were delighted to find it on amazon.com.

review/text: I am NO kind of expert, I don't have a fancy "food critic" palate.  I'm just a regular middle-aged guy who occasionally likes to have some tasty warm tea.  I generally refrain from adding sugar or cream, so I enjoy strong tea...but not too bitter.<br /><br />Numi Organic Tea Magnolia Puerh is not too bitter...that's good.  It was easy to drink and tasted nice.  But it was nothing special.  All the marketing materials and fancy write-ups about what Puerh tea is sort of set me up to expect something really special.  On the whole, the taste was quite pleasant, but I noticed nothing to set it apart from Bigelow or other name brands that are a cut above Lipton but a cut (price-wise) below Numi.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the tea didn't smell better.  With magnolia added, I expected to catch a whiff (I lived in the South for awhile, so I know magnolia).  Nothing.  It smelled like "regular old tea."<br /><br />My daughter (aged 17) liked it a bit more.  I think she appreciated the lack of bitterness, and she did add a half-teaspoon of sugar.  My wife was quite neutral.  And in the end...I'm neutral too.

review/summary: A pleasant, mild tea
review/text: Numi's organic pu ehr teas are harvested from ancient tea trees in China; a little research shows that it's a type of tea with an interesting history. None of that really matters, though, when you're raising a steaming mug to your lips (or an heirloom bone china teacup if that's your style). It's all about the aroma first, and then the taste.<br /><br />This magnolia tea did not signal "floral" to my senses, nor for that matter vanilla as mentioned in the packaging. As it cooled slightly I did notice the "earth notes" developing and I found it very pleasant without milk or sweetener.<br /><br />The first time I brewed it I used one tea bag in my favorite giant mug, and let it steep for 4 minutes. This was just about perfect in strength but I found that I enjoyed it more while hot than cooled off, so I have switched to a smaller mug and two minutes of brewing. I don't drink tea every day and always choose it to suit my mood; this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AR158W">Numi Organic Tea Magnolia Puerh, 16-Count Full Leaf Tea Bags (Pack of 2)</a> is a good choice for mid-evening when I want something more bracing than herbal but with less kick than my beloved smoky Lapsang Souchong.<br /><br />Numi distributes several kinds of tea. While I enjoyed this green-and-black blend, I would be interested in trying some of their white teas and possibly the reds, and I would choose loose tea over the bags. Intriguing!<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2010

review/summary: I quite enjoy it
review/text: To start with, I'm not a big fan of hot tea.  I like iced tea, but I prefer to drink coffee if I'm having a hot beverage.  That said, I was pleasantly surprised with this tea.  It has a good, smooth taste to it.  To me, the taste is not overwhelming or bitter, and it is smooth and strong enough that I didn't feel compelled to add any sweetener.  I would fail miserably if I tried to describe the taste to anyone else, but I can say that I quite enjoy it and will probably pick up some more now that the weather is starting to cool off.

review/summary: Nice for a change of pace!
review/text: I have tried and enjoyed many of Numi's teas - in fact some of my favorite bagged teas are made by this company.  I'm not a "tea connoisseur" by any stretch of the imagination, I just know what tastes good to ME, so I can't comment about "floral notes" or "grassy tastes" or any of that type feedback.  And, I make my tea in a manner which would probably make a true tea aficionado cringe - I put the tea bag into my 12 oz. mug, fill it up with filtered water, and nuke for 2 minutes!  For me, it comes out perfectly this way.<br /><br />This particular tea was a pretty color, smelled wonderful, and made me happy to drink it.  I didn't add anything to it the first time; the second time, I added a packet of Truvia (stevia/erythritol mix) and liked it even better slightly sweetened.  A nice cup of this in the evening satisfies my urge to "graze" and fills my tummy with warmth and satisfaction.  Give it a try, see for yourself!

review/summary: Review from a Puerh Junkie
review/text: I am seriously addicted to Puerh tea & was thrilled to be able to try a new Puerh!  I am not disappointed!  I like it very strong, so I use 2 tea bags rather than 1 per cup.  This is very sweet & not bitter in the least.  I was concerned that the floral flavor would be overpowering, but not so.  If you like a flowery tasting tea, you might be disappointed in that regard.<br />For a green tea blend, it still brewed pretty dark & very rich.  I sweeten my tea with honey & use half and half.  This is a tea that pairs very well with cream.<br />Puerh tea is unique in that it is allowed to ferment or compost a bit.  Sounds really strange & nasty, but I guess that's what sets it apart from any other tea.  I have noticed that people either love this stuff or flat out detest it.  I have also heard that it is commonly drunk after a fatty meal to aid digestion & also that it is a weight loss aid.  I don't care either way about any of these things.  I just LOVE Puerh tea & if it does all those wonderful things then I consider myself lucky to love something that loves me back!<br />Going organic is a no brainier.  One should never drink non organic tea.  You are getting a mega dose of pesticides.  Don't believe me?  Do your homework, & you will say thankee.<br />Bottom line, I like Rishi Puerh Tu Cha the most (offered on Amazon) 5 stars all the way.  However, this makes a delicious substitute if I can't get my Rishi!

review/summary: The Qi Tea
review/text: This Magnolia Puerh Organic Green Tea Blend from Numi is perfect to have with meals, because of its subtlety. Its lovely aroma and taste do not overwhelm other flavors, and it acts almost as a "palate cleanser." It's also an ideal tea for an afternoon break, when you need that "pick me up," as Puerh, from the Yunnan province in China, is legendary for its healing and energizing "Qi" qualities. This tea also contains antioxidants and other good stuff, that in this crazy world we can use to be healthier and less stressed. As someone who has recently given up coffee, I find this tea is a good java replacement; it makes an excellent breakfast beverage for non-coffee drinkers.<br /><br />This green tea blend has a rich golden color when steeped for at least a minute (packaging recommends 2-4 minutes, but not longer) and the box is eco-friendly, using 85% post-consumer waste and soy based inks, with the tea bags being biodegradable.  The box has a slot on the lower part of it that you can punch in, so you can get your individually wrapped bags out one by one. Great hot or cold, or as I like my teas, tepid, this is a wonderful tea for all occasions.
