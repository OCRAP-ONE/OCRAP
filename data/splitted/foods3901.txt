review/summary: Not so Tender...and Very Dry
review/text: I purchased this as an option for my cat since he only eats chicken. This is a much drier and diced product (no juice) as compared to the other Whiskas products in a pouch. However, the pouch is quite stuff, so if you cat likes it, he will surely get enough to eat from this pouch. Also, the picture does not look like the product I was shipped.

review/summary: Cats are carnivores
review/text: Our older cat (14 years old) would only lick the juice from the bowl and let the chunks alone.  I've read since then that cats are carnivores and therefore should not be fed a grain-based diet.  So many cat foods on the market have grains as the main components, and so you have to look for products labeled "grain free".  We found some at our local feed store.  Maybe our first cat would have lived longer if we'd fed him better.

I'm willing to pay a little more to get a box of food I know they love!

review/summary: New formula - NO JUICES ???
review/text: This used to be my cat's favorite food.  But a couple of months ago, they changed the formula and now my cat won't touch it, and I know why.  Each of the four flavors says "in juices" after it.  But since the formula changed, there is absolutely no juice in this food.  The food comes out in one big dry clump.  The juice was my cat's favorite part.  I'll still by the other Whiska's flavors, but not this one.

review/text: I love the tender bites as do my senior cats (17 & 18 yrs old). But I do question the price, which is a unusual.  I get the 24 count variety pack for $9.49 at my local Food Lion grocery store.  I would expect a 48 count pack to be no more than double that price (18.98) so $28.11 would seem a bit high.  Unless of course  48 means 48 - 12 pack boxes.  Then the description needs  a little work.

review/summary: Great Cereal Ridiculous Price
review/text: So I've been looking for this cereal literally every time I go to the store ever since I had it at boot camp 5 months ago. I went to about 4 to 5 different stores all with no success, also none of the store associates from any of the stores knew what I was talking about. Least to say, I was extremely happy to see that I could order my dream cereal on here. The product description does say that its 50 oz. however, for some reason I thought I would receive a much bigger bag for the price of $17.47. The cereal, like I remember it, is very good and my boyfriend agrees that it is the best cereal he has ever had, but sadly after 5 months of searching I wont be ordering this cereal again. The price is way too steep and its simply not worth the price. I will wait for the price to fall before ordering.

review/summary: How to use this powder, it tastes fine
review/text: I seldom write reviews but after reading the only review on this product for the 8 ounce bag size package (the 1.7 ounce bottle has no reviews).  I bought some, because I do not like the fact that over 95% of Equal is dextrose, sugar (only 1.7% is aspartame).  White sugar is a mix of dextrose and fructose.<br /><br />First off the white powder you get is sweet and tastes just like Equal to me.  For one gallon of tea I use 0.5 grams of the aspartame powder.  If you use too much you will get the bitter taste (or sour as the other reviewer said that it tasted).  This is true also with Equal, if you put too many packets in and it tastes bad.<br /><br />I fixed this problem long ago, I never use just Equal.  In the early days of my usage I added white sugar.  Then later I found I could drop the sugar and replace it with Sweet'N Low.  So to my tea I used 10 packets of Equal to 4 packets of Sweet'N Low.  You can drink as much as you like all day long without an after taste.  So with the aspartame powder, to my 0.5 grams of the aspartame I add the 4 packets of Sweet'N Low.<br /><br />The real problem with powdered Aspartame is it does not dissolve in water well.  It is a very fine powder and can't break the water's surface tension.  It tries to clump and even when not clumped it forms a cloudy water.  You solve this by the same method of making gravy from starch.  You put your powder in a small bowl and add water drop by drop and make a paste.  Then dissolve the paste in the water of your tea or whatever you are sweetening.<br /><br />But this is why the powdered Aspartame is packaged with dextrose in the Equal packets.  So the particles of Aspartame are separated by the dextrose particles.  Thus it dissolves.  The previous reviewer most likely did not taste sweetness because it was at the bottom of his cup.

review/summary: Not sweet, Seller sour
review/text: It was not sweet. Small amounts or large amounts, stirred or shaken or blended, this aspartame imparted virtually no sweetness whatsoever to the many drinks I tried it in.  Aspartame is very sensitive to heat, so sellers must be cautious about storage, packaging, and shipping, or aspartame _will_ lose its sweetness.  Seller first told me to return it for a refund, then a few hours later reversed themselves, forcing me to use Amazon's A-Z Warranty, which unfairly places price pressure on Amazon products across the board. The quality of a merchant is determined by how they act when problems arise, and on that basis, I will never do business with HerbStoreUSA again, including this so-called aspartame.

I bought the fruit variety and vegetable variety packs for my daughter-in-law and also had the same shipped to me because I care for him while mom and dad are at work. The other fruits and veggies he is ok with but he goes bananas for the bananas.  I am ordering a case of just bananas because he likes it so much. I hope to have the time to start preparing homemade baby food by the time he runs out of what I already have.  If not, I will keep supplementing with Earth's Best brand of baby food.

review/summary: Repulsive!
review/text: These look, smell, and taste vile.  I try each food first before I give it to my baby and have been very happy with all of the Earth's Best varieties we've tried so far. The bananas however are quite disgusting.  It could be the citric acid used, but it smells and tastes like it is spoiled.  I have been feeding fresh banana up to this point, but bought a 12-jar variety pack of fruit which included banana, so I decided to try it today.  So much for saving money by purchasing the variety pack.  I will be throwing away all four jars of the banana.  I will not feed anything to my baby that I wouldn't eat myself.  Like one of the other reviewers said:  do not stock up on this before you try one jar first.  It's just nasty.  I wouldn't give it any stars if that was an option here.<br /><br />Update:  I still won't buy these bananas again, but I wanted to say that I contacted Earth's Best to complain.  They ended up sending me coupons for a dozen free jars of baby food.  So, I just wanted to add that I really am happy with the company.  Just not this particular product.

review/text: My baby loves that Earth's Best Carrots. And everything else by them.  Their food is of exceptional quality.  I know--because before it goes in my baby's mouth, I try it first.  I hate peas, but the E.B. First Peas are absolutely sensational.  These carrots cannot be beat.  I have compared Earth's Best baby food to Gerbers and Gerbers Organic, and there is simply no comarison.  The Gerbers food--especially the green vegetables--are simply bland and a bit bitter.  I cannot tell you how wonderful (or maybe I'm trying to now!) the E.B. 1st stage baby foods are.  So good, in fact, that I've already stocked up on the variety packs of 2nd stage foods (also conveniently available on Amazon.com for a great price plus the free shipping).  If you love your baby--and I know you do--and you want him to know just how delicious fruits and vegetables can be, BUY THIS STUFF.

review/summary: Our twin 7-month olds love this one - carrots
review/text: I subscribe to the 4 oz. version of this baby food.  Considering price, I think the 4 oz. jars are a better deal.<br /><br />Both our twin babies love this one with carrots as we discovered with the vegetable variety pack.  Other parents have told me their babies like carrots so this one is likely to be a winner.<br /><br />I've tried many Earth's Best baby food in the jars products on my babies.  They like all of them with only a couple exceptions.  I've discovered they're not fond of peas or onions, but I've also discovered that as they get older they will eat more types of foods.  If you get something your baby doesn't like, maybe you can keep it on hand for when your baby is a few months older and try again.<br /><br />Several other varieties of Earth's Best contain carrots.  I think this is to make them sweet so that babies will like them more.<br /><br />The ingredients are simply organic carrots and water.  One 4-ounce jar (not this 2.5 ounce jar) has 40 calories, and daily value: 4% protein, 150% vitamin A and 4% calcium (that's all of it; no iron for example).<br /><br />Compared to other Earth Best varieties, this has very little calories but is very high in vitamin A.  I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult.

I ordered four different flavors of jelly bellies and they all came this way. No one got sick, so I assume this was sanitary.

I find this complex flavor highly civilized and incontrovertibly British.<br /><br />Marmalade requires a lot of sugar in the making, but this marmalade gives us 47g of fruit per 100g, according to the label. For marmalade, that's pretty good. The color is definitely tawny, neither too dark nor too light. Just for fun I did my own taste test with three superior marmalades. Tiptree Tawny was my favorite.

review/text: Everything but the masa spreader can be bought much cheaper at a local store like Walmart.<br />I only bought it because I needed a steamer and wanted the spreader, instead of buying the ingredients myself I thought I'd just grab the package. I didn't like the peppers but everything else was fine.<br />The spread works good if you use it right.<br />Could use a recipe book. Hard to find a good one online.<br />A little advice, dry the corn husks well after you soak them, otherwise the masa wont stick, will mix water, and just be a pain.

review/summary: BEST PB EVER
review/text: Personally, I will never go back to eating typical peanut butter again. I never liked the consistency of regular pb. PB2 is less sugary and it has a more prominent peanut flavor. I prefer the texture AND its 25% of the calories (and 85% less fat). I use this is everything - smoothies, baking, sandwiches, on slices of fruit. I love the original and cocoa flavor. You can't go wrong with either of them so why not get both!<br /><br />Yes, it is a little pricey, but its worth it (especially if you are watching calories and fat content trying to lose weight or just eat healthier in general). You can by it by the 1 pound bags at a discount. I have seen many organic and natural peanut butters that are the same price plus some.<br /><br />Give it a shot on your pbj sandwich and your baking, at least you can say you tried it! But I promise that most you will not be disappointed!

review/text: I purchased this when I was on a big health kick a few months ago. It is actually pretty tasty. I have tried it simply mixed with water and wasn't completely in love with the taste. However, mixed in other things (yogurt, smoothies, etc) it is actually really good. It gives just enough of a peanut butter taste. In my opinion nothing is as good as just regular ole peanut butter, but this is a good runner-up.

review/summary: So so flavor
review/text: These PB2 products are definitely a low calorie alternative if you are willing to give up some of the flavor and texture that you get with original PB. I wasn't a big fan of the regular PB flavor as it was just too different for me from regular PB, and I only used reduced fat PB normally as well. I enjoyed the chocolate flavor a bit better than the regular.<br /><br />Also, it should be noted that because you mix 2 tablespoons of the powder with a tablespoon of water, this actually creates probably half of a jar of PB in the end so this regular sized PB jars go much more quickly.<br /><br />All in all, I'm not sure I will be purchasing this product again. The grainy texture and difference in flavor, along with the fact that you have to do measuring and mixing to get your PB is just not worth it to me. I'll take reduced fat PB.

review/text: Don't get me wrong... the idea is great and the taste isnt bad either. My main problem is the amound of pb2 you have to use to get a decent serving of peanut butter. I could go through a container per week and its too pricey for that. Also- don't expect it to taste like Jiff pb. I liked the taste but I also eat mostly natural peanut butter so I'm not used to the sugary kind.<br /><br />As for the chocolate pb2- Again I wasn't impressed. I could barely taste the chocolate flavor and ended up just mixing in more cocoa powder.

review/text: I am a peanut butter fanatic.  However, I try to limit my intake due to the high calorie content (200 cals per 2 tbs)..and always go for the all-natural to avoid trans-fats.  When PB2 came around I was ecstatic.  No oil, just powdered peanuts and all you have to do is add water until the desired consistency is reached.  The best part 2 tbs is only 45 calories and you don't have to deal with all that mixing in the oil.

review/text: This is a great product for those, like me, who love peanut butter but need to watch the calories and fat.  PB2 provides the great taste and texture of peanut butter but at 15%  the fat and 15% the calories. The product is a fine powder that can be reconstituted with water in a 2:1 ratio.  It also is great mixed into yogurt or (no sugar added, low fat) ice cream.  PB2 also comes in a chocolate and peanut butter flavor that makes that no sugar added, low fat ice cream into a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup flavor.

review/summary: Why would I want regular PB after this??
review/text: Seriously.  Why would I, or anyone, want to eat regular peanut butter when they can have this??  The difference in calories is amazing.  It tastes soo good as well!  I tried both and I must say both are real good.  Plus since, it is only for me I actually like mixing it at the moment and keeping the rest powdered.  Seems sort of "fresher".  Recommended.  The taste is very similar to natural peanut butter (not that stuff that has corn syrup).

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: This stuff is awesome.  I made myself a PB&J this afternoon with the PB2 for the first time.  I was munching on it and thinking it was fine; my mind wandered and I found myself thinking "Mmm, good PB&J!" before doing a mental double take and realizing I was using the powdered PB and finding it delicious.  I'm anxious to use it in cooking in place of normal peanut butter to add the nutty flavor without the extra calories and fat.<br />It is rather expensive, so not necessarily a good purchase if you have a peanut butter problem.  I don't eat peanut butter very often, so I expect these containers to last me a while.

review/text: Don't expect this to taste EXACTLY like peanut butter because it doesn't.  However, it still is pretty tasty.  It's great if you're dieting to add a little extra flavor to something (I usually have some with a banana or sprinkle a little on my cheerios).  The company's website has several recipes which is nice too.

It is a nice substitute for peanut butter with much less calories and a good source of protein.  I will be buying this again.

I wouldn't eat it out of the jar with a spoon but when put on a cracker or sandwhich with sugar free jelly or in a smoothie, you can't tell much of a difference. I love both the regular and cocoa product although you can't tell much difference between the two.

review/text: This stuff is like peanut butter-flavored crack.  You can control how thick or thin you make it, so it's just as perfect to pack in sandwiches without ending up with a gooey mess by noon as it is to drizzle over ice cream.  I usually mix the cocoa flavor with a little chocolate soymilk and eat it right out of the bowl for an indulgent-tasting afternoon snack.

Although it is more expensive than regular peanut butter I think it is worth it considering how little fat and calories it has!  I haven't tried the chocolate version yet but considering how good the regular PB2 I am confident I will enjoy the chocolate version just as much.

review/text: I love this peanut butter! Have mixed it to spread (though it took more water than suggested on the label), as well as used it in baking. So simple to measure and just add extra water to the ingredients. Just ordered the 1 lb. size, as it looks like I'll probably go through it faster than I expected. The chocolate flavor doesn't seem to be overly chocolatey... I used it in a snack bar recipe, but can hardly taste the chocolate flavor. But that's OK. I'd already run out of the regular flavor! The fact that there is less fat hardly affected the recipes I've made, at least that I can tell.

This came highly recommended to me and and I am glad I ordered one of each flavor.  The only thing that was a negative was the date of the use life of the product; it was a short time frame to use it which tells me it has been on the shelf for a  bit longer than normal.  No biggie, I will use it up before that date anyway. The product is great otherwise!
