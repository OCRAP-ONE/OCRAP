review/summary: A Healthy Cookie!
review/text: Okay, maybe not "healthy" but they are an excellent replacement when you read the ingredients! These are not loaded with words only a scientist could love (i.e. those starting with "poly" or ending with "ose", etc.). They are free of artificial preservatives, colors, and flavorings (natural Raspberry and Cranberry used) and are prepared in a nut free bakery for those with allergies and are suitable for vegans. They are lightly sweetened and crunchy and perfect with a cup of tea or glass of milk. I am not a health food junkie, but do like to have alternatives to some of the `junk' I at times crave. They are a tad more expensive than what can be found in the grocery but definitely worth that little extra cost.

review/text: Found these at a local store called Meyers.  Really really wonderful cookies for tea or coffee, or when you just want a whole grain cookie with real substance, not too sweet and with a fruity chew when you bite into a berrie.  The Chocolate ones are my favorite, but I cant find them much anymore.

review/summary: Chocolate Poetry
review/text: Chocolate makes otherwise normal people melt into strange states of ecstasy. ~John West<br /><br />To taste 72% Pure Origin Sao Tome is to enter chocolate connoisseur heaven where chocolate squares become poetry. The delicate snap of the chocolate when you take the first bite, the smooth melting of delicious fine chocolate as you only feel the smoothest of chocolate melting on your tongue in a buttery bliss. These are not bitter or overly sour, as you would expect from a dark chocolate.<br /><br />The taste is more refined and the chocolate is made from the premium cocoa beans found on the island of Sao Tome. This distinctive flavor is a rare bliss for chocolate connoisseurs who wish to taste a pure chocolate without any flavorings or fillers. This is just pure, pure chocolate made with 72 % cocoa, sugar, cocoa butter and soya lecithin.<br /><br />I prefer to savor each piece of chocolate with a cup of tea or coffee. The warmth of the beverage creates an entirely different experience than if you were to simply taste a square of chocolate on its own. Once your mouth is warmed, take a small bite of the chocolate square and enter Chocolate Oblivion where each nuance becomes a journey into pleasure.<br /><br />The world stops for minutes at a time as you savor a mingling of the silkiest chocolate you have ever tasted. If there is a better chocolate, I haven't tasted it. Such perfection! These are chocolates you must eat slowly, letting them melt in your mouth as the superior richness fills your mouth with chocolate bliss.<br /><br />You can also melt 8 squares into 11 ounces of milk to make hot chocolate or you can take pleasure in the superior flavor of one piece of chocolate as a delectable luxury.<br /><br />The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior. My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold ballotin with signature wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping.<br /><br />The Orange and Cinnamon varieties contain natural cinnamon and orange flavorings. The Cinnamon Napolitains or squares have a unique cinnamon flavor that is especially delicious. If you wish to try all the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties.<br /><br />While I am in love with the quality of Leonidas chocolates, the customer service and shipping speed is equally impressive. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />Leonidas chocolates are a thoughtful gift for friends or you may just want to order them for your own chocolate pleasure. I can guarantee that once you taste these chocolates, you will never be fully satisfied by less than the best. When you long for the purity of chocolate in its most refined state, then these are the chocolates to order!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Fruity rooibos!
review/text: Celestial Seasonings is branching out and using Rooibus as a base for some of their newer fruit flavored herbal teas. Rooibos is naturally caffeine free and high in antioxidants.  African Orange Mango is a strongly orange scented and flavored with a hint of mango aftertaste.  It has no sourness at all.  I think it would make a really nice ice tea.  It is a tasty brew that is almost as good as their Moroccan Pomegranate Red Rooibos tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Love will draw an elephant through a keyhole."  Samuel Richardson.

review/summary: Best Tea Ever
review/text: I started drinking red rooibos tea when I gave up caffeine. I especially like the Celestial Seasonings blends because the flavors are satisfying and the price is reasonable. I tried more expensive rooibos teas and found I didn't like them as well. So many of them have too-strong flavors that completely overpower the gentle rooibos experience. I drink Orange Mango Rooibos tea daily, maybe 3 or 4 cups a day. It has a harmonious blend of flavors that enhances just about anything you eat with it (especially dark chocolate) and also makes a great treat all by itself. For even more decadence, add a splash of cream. It also makes a great iced tea.

review/text: Now makes an excellant product and amazon provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery.  The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.

review/summary: Bad batch of Stevia
review/text: Stevia is kind of funny. Brands and batches vary. Sometimes you get a batch that isn't very sweet or has more of an aftertaste (bitterness). Usually, I only have to use 1/16 of a tsp of NOW Stevia to sweeten my morning coffee. The batch I received this time is weak, so I have to use twice as much. (Thank goodness it isn't bitter though.) So it goes with using a natural sweetener. The leaves from which this batch of stevia was extracted must not have had a very high concentration of rebaudiana. I strongly believe that the manufacturer should test out each batch made for quality before packaging it so customers aren't disappointed. Oh, well, better luck next time. I'll still use stevia as a sweetener (I use it in everything I need sweetened). I'm just going to wait a while before buying more NOW stevia until I'm fairly certain all of this batch has been sold.

review/summary: SUPER NATURAL SUGER SUBSTITUTE + TERRIFIC BRAND
review/text: EXCELLENT SUGAR SUBSTITUTE HAS HEALTH BENEFITS + NO WARNINGS,<br /><br />This "NOW Stevia powder" is good stuff and this among the most economical and user-friendly ways to buy Stevia.<br /><br />WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT:<br /><br />Sweeter than sugar, that's what Stevia is, but that's not all.<br /><br />Stevia has been shown to lower blood sugar levels in research involving healthy adults by increasing the secretion of insulin making Stevia useful for diabetics.<br /><br />It also improves digestion and gastrointestinal function, and is useful for upset stomachs and to reduce gas and stomach acidity. Several recent studies have shown that it may improve the heart's muscle tone and promote the body's water loss. These properties are thought to contribute to lower blood pressure.<br /><br />Stevia also has antiviral, antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. It's used for relieving bleeding gums, sore throats and cold sores in South America and Japan. Stevia has been shown to inhibit plaque formation and bacterial growth causing gum disease and tooth decay, and will not cause cavities. It may even reduce cravings for sweets which coupled with its lack of calories may be helpful in weight loss.<br /><br />ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS EVEN MORE:<br /><br />There is anecdotal evidence that Stevia is good for skin problems like acne, cold sores, dermatitis and eczema, and may speed up the healing of cuts and scratches. There have even been reports that Stevia may be useful as a contraceptive, but that has not yet been substantiated by research.<br /><br />FDA APPROVAL TO BE SOLD AS A FOOD SUPPLEMENT -- NOT A SWEETENER<br /><br />Most of all, Stevia, unlike the artificial sweeteners we put in everything from soda to psyllium does not come with any health warnings from the FDA, and it will probably do you no harm. However, Stevia has not been approved to be sold as a sweetener even though it is a NATURAL SWEETENER LIKE SUGAR. Nevertheless, Stevia has been approved [since 1994] to be sold as a dietary supplement in the United States.<br /><br />AFTER ALL THE SMOKE HAS CLEARED THIS IS FOOD - USE IT BY EATING IT!<br /><br />Stevia can be substituted for sugar. It is a bit different tasting if one is use to sugar. I use it on many things where I can eliminate large amounts of honey and/or sugar such as;<br /><br />1]- Herbal Tea, instead of sugar or honey.<br /><br />2]- In multi-grain hot cereal, when you need to sweeten it, Stevia saves me a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of sugar per large bowl. In this case I just add about a teaspoon of honey and 1/8 teaspoon of stevia for the same effect. Stevia is much sweeter than sugar so use about 1/10th as much in place of sugar.<br /><br />3]- Iced Tea.<br /><br />4]- Pancakes, waffles and French Toast as a replacement for some maple syrup.<br /><br />MEDICINALLY SPEAKING:<br /><br />A standardized extract of 57 mg. containing 85% "steviocides" in a beverage, is what Doctor James A. Duke, suggests in his famous, "The Green Pharmacy Herbal Handbook".<br /><br />ABOUT FORMS AND BRANDS:<br /><br />I prefer Stevia in powder over the packets, as I can better measure, and use what I need for each individual use. Purchase Stevia in whatever form you are most comfortable using.<br /><br />This "NOW" brand Stevia powder is an excellent product and a terrific value. "Planetary Formulas Stevia Powder 3.5 oz." is also excellent and it comes in a liquid as well. "Swanson" and "Nature's Way" are both excellent too, and have Stevia in powder, liquid and packets for convenient use. Any of the above choices are excellent, and I have used them all at one time or another, over the past 3-4 years on a daily basis.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

review/summary: my preferred sweetener
review/text: I have been a diabetic for almost forty years.  I have tried many sweeteners over the years, some of which caused me some severe reactions.  Years ago, I decided I preferred stevia.  Lately I did another comparison between the different stevia brands.  Better Stevia Organic in the packets is the one I decided to go with.  I do not bake with sweeteners and eat very little baked goods since I am selective on how I expend my carb allowance.  Mostly I just use the stevia in beverages. The organic stevia packets are lined with an inner seal, I suppose to keep it fresh and to keep it from getting hard. However when you hold the packet over a cup of hot beverage the stevia draws moisture and clings to the liner making it difficult to pour out. I simply add the stevia to my cup before I pour in the liquid.  It also does not dissolve quickly in iced beverages.  It takes a minute or two for it to completely dissolve. I like this Stevia Organic enough to deal with these issues.  It does not have additional ingredients.  It is just organic stevia and I like it that way.

review/text: I love NOW's stevia extract, I put it in everything - tea, cereal, curries, stir fries, baking.  There are no sugar carbs at all and it is 200 time sweeter than sugar so 1 lb goes a long way.  The savings with a pound it amazing (compared to $10 for a very small container) and it seems to stay good for a long time, it takes me sometimes a year to finish it.  Some people find that stevia leaves an aftertaste that do not care for so you may want to try a smaller bottle first if you have never tried it.  Every brand supposedly is a little different so if you don't have good luck with one try another.

review/summary: BEWARE OF THIS MISLEADING PRODUCT!!
review/text: The very 1st thing I noticed about this product was how nasty it tasted! I've tried stevia by numerous manufacturers (PLUS, I read the excellent reviews!)  and this is hands-down the worst!<br /><br />When I finally read the actual ingredients (I had assumed it was stevia) and discovered that the very 1st ingredient wasn't stevia..but RICE MALTODENTRIN, I was shocked AND angry!  I have a liver disorder and cannot pump crap like maltodextrin into my liver!  Hence, the use of stevia, an all natural product.  BEWARE IF YOU HAVE DIABETES and think this is a safe sugar substitute.  It's NOT!  Below is a quote from a website (the link follows)...and there are plenty of others with warnings for maltodextrin for those who are looking for an safe sugar substitute.<br /><br />PLUS... I don't care what anyone says.  If you think this is the best stevia product ever (and many actually do!) then you haven't tried the right stevia manufacturer.  NOW isn't one of them.<br />I ordered this shoe in the correct size but they were huge.  i am returning them & hoping that the smaller size will work.  they match the dress perfect & are adorable.<br />..."It's the combination that may cause spikes in insulin because maltodextrin is a carbohydrate with a high glycemic index, similar to table sugar and should be used in moderation if you have diabetes or hypoglycemia. You must consider the carbohydrate content of products sweetened with added maltodextrin to maintain healthy blood sugar levels."<br /><br />Read more:[...]

review/summary: Do Not Like the Taste Compared to Truvia
review/text: I tried this product and I have to say that I just cannot tolerate the taste.  At least for me, it tastes awful. I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I have been using Truvia and Truvia tastes much more like sugar than this product.  I don't know what this tastes like.  It is unlike anything I've ever tasted - and it sure doesn't taste like sugar to me. I had to pour out a fresh pitcher of green tea because it tasted so bad.  I made another pitcher of tea with Truvia and it was much better tasting. I usually mix some real sugar with Stevia.  But this last pitcher of tea was sweetened only by Truvia (Stevia) and it was pretty good tasting. It certainly isn't an identical taste to sugar, but close enough after you adjust to the taste.  When I use Truvia with coffee and cream, I can't tell the difference with real sugar.  And that is probably because the French Vanilla cream overwhelms the overall taste.<br /><br />I know my review is counter to the other reviews, but it is just my experience and opinion.  Everybody has a different sense of taste. All food has a rather intense taste to me. About 25% of the population is a super taster. We have many more taste buds on our tongue. That describes me. So you may have a different experience than I did.

review/text: I've used stevia powder for years. NOW is an excellent source at a great price. If you are baking, stevia is not very good for that as it will not give the same texture as white sugar. However, it is outstanding for sweetening tea, coffee and smoothies.<br /><br />Many have claimed that stevia is 200 times as sweet as white sugar. I don't agree. To my taste it is no more than 16 times as sweet.<br /><br />Be careful about using too much because it slips from sweet to bitter to the taste when that happens.

review/summary: Amazing price as opposed to buying retail...
review/text: I've been on the Atkins/Low-Carb diet for several years so I avoid sugar like the plague. Also to be avoided are carbonated diet-drinks. Which leaves me little choice other than water. So, I make a half-gallon of Kool-Aid with a teaspoon of Stevia EXTRACT and a teaspoon of liquid saccharin. Some complain this is too sweet for their tastes. But, do the math, a pound of sugar is LOT more expensive and takes at least a full cup per half gallon.<br /><br />In the past, I've had to purchase Stevia at the health food stores for $12-$15 an OUNCE. Here I bought a POUND (16 ounces) for less that the cost of four ounces from the health food stores. Fantastic price!<br /><br />Be careful what you wish for, a POUND of Stevia is a LOT of Stevia (At least a year's worth...;-}  )<br /><br />In a year, I'll buy another jug of it.

review/summary: Teeny tiny spoon!
review/text: I've been trying a number of different kinds of stevia, both liquid and powder. This one is my favorite. It has a very neutral taste and one tiny spoon of it is perfect in a big glass of oolong hibiscus iced tea. A heaping tiny spoon of it is perfect in a chocolate/banana/soy milk smoothie. I originally got it to put in something called "mega muffins" but managed to use up an entire 1 oz container of it without even making the muffins and have had to order more. I really like that it's organic. I've been trying different sweeteners in my hibiscus oolong iced tea, and this is not only better than any other stevia product I've found, but works better than any other sweetener as well. Even regular granulated sugar. It dissolves pretty much instantly. I'm thinking about ordering the 1 lb size (although that would probably last me about two years) I just wonder if that size comes with the teeny tiny spoon!

review/summary: Better Than Sugar!
review/text: I have used Stevia for several years, but often have had trouble finding it. It was a real pleasure to find it on Amazon! Stevia is a natural sweetener made from the Stevia rebaundiana leaf. It is not an artificial sweetner made with chemicals. It has no unpleasant taste, though people who use artificial sweeteners may take a few days to get used to the lack of "chemical" sweeteners. Most people who use Stevia find that they can use less of it than other sweeteners as it's sweetness level is higher per packet. I recommend Stevia to anyone who wishes not to use sugar for any reason, but still likes things a bit sweet. By the way, Stevia has no calories.

review/text: I love stevia, I have experimented with the liquid, glycerin, the one oz powder size and this is by far the best for your money.  Just be careful adding it to something cold, you might want to mix it with warm-to-hot water first to get it in liquid form before adding it.  Also, I make approx 2 liters of tea at a time and only need to add one-half teaspoon stevia powder!  I am very thankful for this 16 oz size!

review/summary: Great price for 1lb
review/text: I'm so glad I found this 1 pound of NOW stevia.  It is so much cheaper than the little bottles I had been buying for $8/oz.  The packaging is very wasteful--most of it is empty.  Eventually filling my little bottles will get hard unless I transfer the bulk into a smaller container.<br /><br />The taste is fine to me, better than Trader Joe's.  I've never had Kal's to know what I am missing.  I mainly use the stevia in tea and Kool Aid lemonade.  DH even liked my tea w/ stevia and he is a big sweet tea drinker.  I have started baking banana bread w/ stevia and have been very pleased.  I've never minded what little aftertaste of Stevia since my mom used Sweet N Low when I was growing up.<br /><br />FYI-The 1 pound package didn't come w/ the tiny single scoop, unless buried at bottom.  That would have been nice to have.

By the way, the Stevia is actually packaged in white envelopes, not the blue envelopes shown in the advertisement. And the 1,000 envelopes come in a clear plastic bag with the best (open and close) nylon strap closure we have ever seen. You will get your moneys worth.

We loved the cream of mushroom soup and since my daughter had loved cream of chicken before she needed to be wheat free, we thought this would be fantastic.  I cannot even begin to describe the taste.  We tried to pour this over different casseroles and the results ended up being thrown away.  Just not good and you cannot even begin to eat as a plain soup.  Doesn't even begin to taste like chicken.<br /><br />If you want a good wheat free creamy soup for casseroles, try Healthy Valley cream of mushroom.  Just a hint of mushroom, so great for those that aren't fans of mushrooms.

I give them to friend's little dogs when they get down to 6" or less.<br />I rinse them off with hot water every day so they are clean and the marrow inside releases a taste they seem to like.<br />Great product - worth the money.

review/text: I picked up this blend on a whim about 2 years ago and it quickly became a favorite for my husband and myself.  It's great on fish and even better with steamed jasmine rice (put the seasoning in before cooking the rice).  I haven't had the issue the other poster mentioned, as the peel grates up just fine for me and the flavors are evident in the food.<br /><br />My only complaint is the adjustability of how fine/coarse you want it.  The fine is SUPER fine and will wear out your wrist if you want any measurable amount.  The coarse is a bit too coarse for my tastes, and I wind up with chunks.  I just may get another grinder to use with this so I can get it the size I want.

review/summary: Among the GOOD Ones
review/text: Let me qualify myself.  Been brewing espresso for about ten years.  Last five years using fairly high end equipment and superior beans ground for each cup.  Nearly all the time I make my espresso straight with a quarter tea spoon sugar and no milk.  Therefore my espresso reflects the flavor of the type of bean with a light softening of the bitterness by sugar.<br /><br />  All this experience indicates beans taste best immediately after roasting and/or opening a vacuum bag.  Taste and crema amount tapor off in the first week quite a bit.  Personal tastes may come to other conclusions but freshness makes a big difference.<br /><br />  Bought two fifty pod bags of espresso.  Among those the Lucaffe' Classic was better than most of the twenty five varieties (four each) I tasted.  Your taste might be different.  This Lucaffe' Classic is smoother, less bitter, and hints at some pleasant subtle flavors I found unique.<br /><br />  Perhaps more important than this particular pod expresso is the clear conclusion for me that pods produce much better espresso flavors than all my efforts to brew from freshly ground beans.  Clean up to a lot easier and each shot consistantly fresh due to the foil containers.  It is possible over time even the foil wrapping will not prevent loss of flavor I do not know.  There is no date on wrapped pods.<br /><br />  Bottom line:  Pod espresso is superior to grinding your own.  Freshness is more consistant.  Clean up is a LOT easier. Time from start to finish is much less.  Now I grind only for regular coffee.<br /><br />  IMPORTANT for POD brewing with my machine is plenty of warm up time for espresso machine which reduces amount of extraction in normal brew time of TWENTY TWO SECONDS plus or minus a few seconds.  Too short warm up can double ounces extracted in given time.  And it is possible that some brands of pods allow too much liquid to pass in twenty two seconds which is the standard time generally accepted.<br /><br />  Have you noticed these pods are the same concept as the Nespresso machines and other similar types?  However these pods offer more variety and more competition among suppliers can lead to lower prices if you buy the 150 pods size.<br /><br />  So why only four stars?  Some other pods taste slightly better to me.  I would give my own, from scratch, brews only three stars compared to pods who get four or five stars.

Everyone that has tried it has been very impressed, and after drinking this, no one can stomache the Starbucks brand ESE pod.  Excellent crema, a subtle sweetness, and very rich.
