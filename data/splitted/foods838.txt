review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: I was a little worried that this stuff would be like most sugar free drinks and leave you wanting for something sweet.  I have only tried the Cherry and Grape so far, but they are REALLY good.  My 8 year old son really likes it too, so I guess thats reason enough for me.  Anything to cut down on our family's sugar intake.  Each packet calls for 8 cups of water in a pitcher, but I mix it with only 7 cups to give it a little extra flavor, and it's delicious.  Our favorite so far is the grape, but we have not tried the tropic punch yet.  I'm hoping they expand the number of flavors in their Sugar free line as right now I can only find it in the 3 flavors.

review/summary: Husband is Happy - Not anymore.
review/text: Thank you, Amazon for carrying this! It's the only beverage aside from water that my husband will drink.<br /><br />Going back to when I met him --- He would buy regular Kool-Aid and add all the sugar.  Once I came into the picture, I turned him on to the Sugar Free version.  He LOVED it.  Then, in seemed like "all of a sudden" the grocery stores quit carrying the cherry flavor.<br /><br />I did an internet search and found the Cherry Sugar Free Kool-Aid on Amazon.  Perfect shipping. Other reviews have mentioned the powder being chunky or hard to break up.  While we did experience that on our first shipment almost a year ago, we have since enountered it.<br /><br />I don't drink Cherry Kool-Aid.  Hubby is so happy and we've signed up for the recurring shipping.  Free shipping and a 15% discount on our order?  Thank you!<br /><br />Update - 12/29/2011 - BOOOOOO! Apparently Kool-Aid is no longer making this as Amazon just cancelled my recurring shipment.  Why on earth would they cancel something so amazing?

I found these a couple years ago at a local Celtic shop and have been getting the ever since . They are Two rich chocotlate biscuits with a nice layer of smooth chocolate filling between them and covered in a superb chocolate iceing . Now I find most choclates give you a warm feeling in your mouth after eating them . This bar does the exact opposite . It leaves your mouth feeling cool and refreshing . The biscuits literally melt in your mouth . They might be a bit expensive but once you try them you will know it was well worth the price .

review/text: It's no contest: Red Vines are 100% certified deliciousness, while Twizzlers are essentially your grandmother's melted candles that have been molded into a shape that dishonestly attempts to imitate Red Vines.<br /><br />And like a fine wine, Red Vines only get better with age.  On a tub-size container like this, I like to leave one side cracked open to allow some oxygen to enhancing the aging process.<br />Twizzlers + age?  Let me just say, it's not a pretty sight.

review/summary: Caution, if you don't want a pocket full of powder!
review/text: I wish I had know that this product was changed in a very significant way. We were buying the freeze dried liver for training treats. It was real liver, diced into small pieces that were easy to transport and carry. The product now, with the misleading description of "ceter cut", is processed liver that has been stamped out. It is soft and extremely crumbly, and is reduced to powder in my pockets in no time. Comparison of the empty container with this new one showed no difference at all except for an adhesive label placed on the cover over the old one. I called the company to ask about the product change; the rep explained they changed the product to the processed one and said customer feedback indicates people don't like it. She said the regular, natural liver is still made, and is available at a national chain pet store, but not on Amazon. She kept apologizing, and was unable to explain to me why a correct description is not on the container; at this price, I would have appreciated a coupon toward the regular product at the pet store, since I have a 3/4 tub of the crumbly stuff that I can't use. I wish Amazon would carry the "old" product also, with an accurate description. Based on what she said, that is the product with the customer following.

review/text: Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.

It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom.

review/summary: Where's the Apricot?
review/text: I really wanted to enjoy this tea:  great aroma and lots of fruit chunks (like a tea "trail mix").  Don't understand how something that smells so much like apricot when dry doesn't taste like apricot when prepared as tea.  I found this rather bland as a hot tea and more on the sweet side when iced.<br /><br />In my book for apricot tea, The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf apricot ceylon still rules.

review/text: Bought this flavor of kettle brand chips in a 13 oz bag as an add-on item. Disgusting flavored chips. No cheddar taste. Not sure of sour cream.  Just YUK!!!!!!!!!  The chips were brown, burned, and broken.  Bag was greasy and what should have been seasoning on chips was matted on side and bottom.  Totally disgusting.  Buy @ you own risk.  Possibly bad because it was an add-on item.  Our experience with add-on items has been that they are bad or not available.

review/summary: Good-enough coffee and a bargain
review/text: This is NOT a review for coffee connoisseurs...<br /><br />While this coffee may not win any awards, it's not so bad either.  I think it's best to set our expectations first. Let's define what BAD coffee is.  Think about the coffee usually available in the breakrooms of Corporate America. They're usually extremely watered down and taste bitter and acidic so people end up drowning them with creme and sugar. I'm not sure if you can call that drinking coffee at that point as opposed to some concoction of sugar-milk-coffee that kinda sorta resembles coffee. When you open the cabinets, you'll be staring at a box of corporate coffee usually with the labels "Folgers", "Maxwell House" or [insert another brand here]. Yes, they are BAD coffee.  Let's keep that disgusting drink in mind when reviewing the Community Decaffeinated coffee.<br /><br />At a price point of 4 bucks and change for each bag, it's a bargain since you'll see that most decent coffee will cost you $7-9 for a 12oz bag at your local grocery store. I suppose you can stop by Starbucks and get your grande cup and pay $2-3 each time. But if you have a coffee brewer and a grinder, you can easily recreate the Starbucks experience right at home for so much less. I like sniffing the fresh aroma after grinding the beans.<br /><br />I always drink my coffee black. Good-enough coffee can be had without sugar and creme and that is what this coffee is. It is not intense in flavor and aroma but I like mine light bodied without that strong overpowering taste of French Roast.  I deliberately choose decaffeinated b/c I like to drink lots of coffee and this allows me to drink much more coffee than caffeinated coffee. I might down 8 cups in a day and not worry about getting the jitters and a racing heart followed by intense heart burn all due to having consumed too much caffeine. I only wish there were more flavors in decaffeinated form.<br /><br />4/5 stars. It's not the best but good enough and good bang for the buck. It may not work for everyone but it works for me.<br /><br />[Update 4/2012]: I've seen the prices of Community Coffee fluctuate a lot since buying my first batch. Now each bag is not $3 but more like $5.50 (if you subscribe). At this price point, it's not the stellar deal as before but it's still respectable, although I would perhaps consider paying up $2-3 to get a "better" bag of coffee from the grocery store. Just a thought.

review/summary: Passable at best
review/text: I bought this variety of Community Coffee when there was a substantial price dip. While it's drinkable, I'm really glad I didn't pay full price for it. It's weak with very little body. It's drinkable, but not at all memorable. A very monotone flavor.<br /><br />I'll be using the rest of my purchase in combination with some flavored coffees I have that are a bit too flavor-strong. A mix of two-thirds flavored coffee and one-third Community Coffee dilutes the flavor to the right level for my taste.<br /><br />If you're looking for a robust, tasty decaf brew, with rich flavor you need to look elsewhere - this is not the one. Other reasonably-priced ones I'd recommend are Weaver's, Lavazza, Coffee Bean Direct and Mayorga.

review/summary: Fine for everyday morning coffee
review/text: This a light-medium roast mild flavored everyday morning coffee.  I bought it because the special offer price was too good to refuse and am pleased that the taste is acceptable.  I would compare it with the store brand of ground coffee from our local Food City supermarket.  Many of the more famous brands of coffee (like Starbucks or Gevalia) are too bitter for my taste.<br /><br />I have been using 3 coffee scoops (the scoop that comes in the can of ground coffee) per 7 cup pot of water.  A lot of people would prefer a stronger flavor using more coffee and/or less water. If you want a really robust coffee (that's silly - robust coffee drinkers don't buy decaf do they?) this is not for you.  If you want a "gentle" pleasant cup of coffee, try this brand.<br /><br />I would not pay more for this brand, but if it goes on sale again at the special offer price I would purchase it again.  At a higher per bag price I will go back to purchasing fair trade organic brands.

review/text: I always order coffee with dessert when I'm eating out.  Every time, I say to myself, I wish I could make coffee as good as this!  I have long sought out coffee that would taste as good as the coffee that every restaurant seems to be able to make.  Well, I have found it!<br /><br />I originally ordered this coffee because Amazon had some nice coupons that made the coffee insanely cheap.  I wasn't expecting much since it was so cheap.  But, I was pleasantly surprised at the smoothness of the coffee.  Also, the coffee I usually buy has a slight bitter taste to it, but this coffee has an almost sweet taste to it, which I love!  It's one of the only coffees I can drink without adding any creamer, sugar, or milk.<br /><br />I'm keeping my subscribe and save on this product because not only is it cheap, it's as good as restaurant coffee!

review/summary: Bitter and weak
review/text: I bought two six packs when this was on special recently and since the reviews were few and all over the place, the price was low enough that I took a gamble.<br /><br />If you buy this, keep in mind that you need two tablespoons of beans per cup.  This is twice the amount of coffee usually called for and these are the instructions on the Community Coffee bag.  The good thing is that you'll go through this coffee twice as quickly, so as long as you brew regularly...you'll use it up relatively quickly.<br /><br />The taste is on the bitter side, so I have been compensating with cream and more stevia than I usually use with my coffee.  I have been using Zero Water to brew my coffee and even that doesn't help this coffee to taste great.<br /><br />It's not great, it's not terrible.  My son will drink it with me, my wife will not.  It certainly isn't dishwater as the one and two star reviews for this product indicate, it IS better than that.  I was disappointed that this didn't live up to the four and five star reviews.  This certainly does not hold up to the taste and quality of beans that I have gotten from Dunkin' Donuts although since DD runs about $6 per pound and this ran about that for 2 1/4 pounds, it seems like a good deal.  Again, since you use twice the amount of this brand vs. DD, the per cup price ends up about the same just absent the quality<br /><br />I am almost done my first bag and it has lasted about two weeks.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this coffee, but alas I just can't get there.  If I have a better experience with the remaining bags, I will post an update to this review.

review/text: I have been using this brand for a while. I drink a lot of coffee and good, affordable decaf whole beans are hard to find. This makes a good, everyday coffee at an affordable price. I also sometimes mix it with some of my more expensive beans to make a very nice blend at less cost. I used to order it direct from the company and was happy when Amazon started selling it, with Prime shipping I save a lot of money over the course of a year.  If you are having a hard time finding beans you can afford to grind and brew, try these.

review/summary: Delicious Soda Alternative!
review/text: These are a great beverage to serve instead of soda at parties and gatherings. We used to get them at the local health food store, but now can only find them on Amazon. They are really worth it! I would particularly recommend both the peach and guava flavors. They're delicious on their own, mixed into smoothies, frozen into sorbet or popsicles, and added to fruity cocktails (definitely try making Bellinis using Kerns peach nectar, it's so good!!) They sometimes taste a little bit like aluminum if you're drinking it straight from the can, but this goes away once you pour it into a glass. They are also very very sugary; not the thing if you're looking for something lightly fruit-flavored! But they're great if you're looking for a treat that doesn't have quite as much refined sugar in it as soda.

review/text: I've been using this product for at least a decade. You clear the area of weeds first, apply by sprinkling the grains, then lightly water. Depending on rainfall it lasts 3-4 months. Do wish they could make it last 6 months since here in the Midwest it sometimes gets warm in March or early April; if applied then, one would have to put down another application in July or so. The label lists the plants around which it can be used: the list is very long. I usually put it in and around my hedge, flowers, lilac and forsythia bushes, tomato and bell pepper plants as well as along the fence. It saves a lot of work.

review/summary: Good Job
review/text: I really love this stuff. I have a very big yard, a demanding job, a chronically ill husband to care for and a 15 year old who is being home schooled. Needless to say, I don't have time to be in the yard all day everyday, but when we bought our first home in the winter I was stunned and overwhelmed by the forrest that grew in the yard in the summer. My neighbor gave me a really hard time about the weeds as well. We were first time home owners and didn't know what to do. My approach would have been to offer advice rather than pick a fight, but I guess some people would rather be bullies. But anyway...<br /><br />I did my research and found Preen which is just wonderful. I used the preen on the hill in our back yard and along the sides of my home where weeds grow. I did notice grass growing where I used the Preen. Apparently the weeds were choking out the grass. But I love how Preen makes my yard look nice and neat. Now my neighbor can shut her mouth about my yard and my yard now looks better than hers. Just wait until the summer when I mulch, plant, and trim!<br /><br />We have decided to sell the home though b/c it is too much work that I don't have time to do. Preen helped me keep my sanity though. I HIGHLY recommend it. The only reason I gave it a 4 is becaue I so wish it had weed killer and preventer as well. Seems when you buy the two combinations together the killer or the preventer action is diminished.

review/text: I did everything right. I plowed my garden with my tractor completly turning under the dirt and weeds. I then disked till any weeds were pulversized and then roto tilled with the tractor and a 5 foot rototiller until there was not a sign of weeds left after this process. I spread the PREEN even heavier than recommended. THE WEEDS IN MY TOMATOES and PEPPERS ARE DOING GREAT THOUGH. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! DO NOT TRUST THE ONE OR TWO GLOWING REVIEWS LISTEDE UNDER THE SEVERAL LISTINGS FOR THIS PRODUCT. Ask yourself if you trust these reviews/reviewers. I say they have "skin in the game" and cannot be trusted. Who are they really-actually buyers or shills for the Manufacturer/sellers ? I know where I'd put my money. I'm fortunate in that I did not pay the full overpriced amount for mine. I bought it at the end of the season when Sam's Club was practically giving it away for pennies on the dollar. I used it the next spring so it really should not have been affected by any expiration date or anything like that. IT JUST DOES NOT WORK.

review/summary: Almost undrinkable due to the artificial sweetener taste
review/text: Each package comes with 8 milk creamer discs and 8 chai tea discs, making a total of 8 drinks.  You use the creamer disc first, then the tea disc.  Tassimo recommends that you run the brewer through a cleaning cycle after making a milk drink (you don't want to spoil your next non-milky drink).<br /><br />I love Chai (or spiced) tea with a little sugar or honey, so I was really looking forward to a Chai Latte made with my brand new Tassimo Brewer.  Boy was I disappointed!<br /><br />I don't see it in the description, but the tea contains sucralose (that's the sweetener in Splenda).  While I generally avoid artificial sweeteners in general, as I don't like the taste, I do make some exceptions.  It's possible to use them and have an enjoyable flavor if the flavors are balanced.<br /><br />They aren't in this Twinings Chai.  There is definitely too much sweetener.  I would prefer that they err on the side of not enough sweetener---after all, everyone has their own preferences, but I can always add more, I can't remove what's already there.<br /><br />The balance between the milk and tea was also off and the milk has a decided reconstituted dry milk taste to it.  Not my fave. ;0)  Between the sweetener overkill and the milk, it was hard to even tell that this was spiced tea or tea at all.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing again.

review/summary: Fairly Decent Flavor
review/text: I don't taste the artificial sweetener the others have mentioned. Maybe it's because I use it. What I encountered was too much nutmeg? over a cheap assam or whatever tea they use. Despite that initial taste, it wasn't long before this became my favorite of the two T-disc flavors I've had so far (Maxwell House House Blend & Geavalia Cap.). I discovered that if I add more sugar or sweetener or a tiny bit more water, to this tea, it improved the taste. If I want a coconut taste, I squirt some light whip cream in it. After trying the undrinkable Gevalia cappaccino, I was relieved to find something I liked, because I didn't want to return my Tassimo machine. The creamer isn't bad in this one. I don't know if it's a different kind or if it is a good combination of seasoning. I gave it 3 stars because for this price, Twinings should have used a better grade of tea. It tastes pretty good now, but there is that subtle aftertaste of earthy tea. With the milk, it fills my insulated glass 3/4 of the way full. One other feature, it smells wonderful brewing! It IS Thanksgiving in a cup! (Thermal glass, I mean.) Unless amazon lowers their price, you can get a better deal at Walmart for $8.48. I think it's catching on because they were sold out in two of the Walmart's I went to. In a pinch, I can also order it at Bed, Bath, & Beyond, and after using their 20% coupon, it is $8.79 (regular price: $10.99 for the 16 disc (8 servings) pkg.). BBB has free shipping to your house. If you have Walmart online send it to your local Walmart, then shipping is free. If your store doesn't carry it, bring in the barcode to customer service and make sure someone in the grocery department gets it. If amazon had an equal price or better than Walmart, I would buy it from them, because I like amamzon.

review/text: I was skeptical about trying these chocolate cups because they are dairy free and I was afraid that they would not taste very good.  I made some delicious pudding shots (seriously, it tastes like there is no alcohol in the pudding), and the cups are delicious.  Unfortunately, I can't stop eating them (I've already had three today), and when my boyfriend comes home from work, he heads straight for the freezer, where they are currently stored.  He loves the chocolate cups, I love the chocolate cups, my friends love the chocolate cups.....no complaints all around.

review/text: This is a beautiful tea set and I love making tea in it and serving to my friends in the adorable matching cups. My only disappointment was the very first time I used the cups, the hot tea actually cracked the glaze on the bottom of the cup, creating a spiderweb effect. Every single cup! I could hear the glaze cracking after I poured. I've never had glazed teacups before, so maybe this is normal, but I kind of doubt it. They still look pretty, even with the cracks, but I worry about their integrity.

review/summary: USE THE CUPS MORE THAN ONCE!!! EXTRA VALUE!
review/text: I don't know if most people know this or not, but in Japan we put loose green tea leaves in a pot and just keep pouring hot water over it until the "taste" is too weak. All the water must be poured out after no more than 3 minutes or else the tea will be biter. Thats why most Japanese tea sets are so small. Green tea isn't meant to be left in a teapot like english teas. So my first cup of green tea was actually a little stronger than I am used to and I actually got 3 uses out of ONE k-cup. I highly recommend using them more than once if you are making the tea one cup after another....and it will save you MONEY!

If you're used to the watered-down "green" tea they serve at chinese buffets or cheaper restaurants, you may find it bitter.  Stick to water, this isn't for you.<br /><br />While not the same quality as good Japanese teas, It is the best I've had from the K-cups, and better than most of the tea bags I can get in the states.<br /><br />If you like REAL green tea, you'll probably love this.  If you're A WIMP, try Snapple.

Maybe it's too concentrated, or the water's not hot enough.  I tried different drink size options, and that didn't work.  Maybe the black teas are better.  I'll stick to a different green tea, and brew it the old fashioned way.

I wanted a green tea like the Celestial Seasonings Green Tea but was looking for a better price than Green Mountain coffee website offers. I do not drink hot tea so I cannot comment on how it is for a cup of hot tea. I drink my iced tea plain - no sugar or lemon and I found this tea very crisp and refreshing but not strong like the black tea. I would say the taste compares to the Celestial Seasonings green tea. I have 2 brew sizes on my Keurig and I brew on the large cup and just add ice ~ if you wanted a stronger tea, of course you could brew on the smaller cup.

The tea is great tasting and same quality as in the bags. The only problem I have with tea from the Keurig is that I like my tea hotter than a cup of coffee. Coming through the k-cup doesn't really seep the tea.  If that's not a big deal to you, then this is great for your keurig.
