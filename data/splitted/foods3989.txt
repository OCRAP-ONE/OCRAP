review/summary: WHY ME?
review/text: I am cursed.  I love these things.  At one time I truly feel I was addicted to them.  It is one of the few foods that once I start eating, I simply cannot stop until I either run out of them or I founder.  Hot or cold, I love them.<br /><br />Alas though, I am no longer allowed to eat them.  My physicians and my wife conspired against me (Well, my body did too...it really let me down), and they all monitor what I eat quite closely.  They have even brought my kids and grandkids into their repressive ring of food police.  Curses.<br /><br />When I get separated from my wife at the grocery store she never has to notify the manager.  She always goes to the pop-tart shelf where she will find me gazing longingly at the wonderful displays and fondling the boxes.  She gently but firmly leads me away...sigh.<br /><br />In the big scheme of things, these little gems are really not all that unhealthy for normal people.  My problem is that I am not normal.  I could probably get buy with it if I could only eat one now and then.  For me that is impossible...I simply can not stop.  This is odd because I am actually a pretty disciplined individual with an iron will...not with these though...they are my bane.<br /><br />The last time I had one of these delights was about a year ago.  My wife was gone and I found a box of them in the very back of one of our pantries.  I opened a pack and was blissfully stuffing my face when suddenly she came through the back door.  I quickly crammed the half eaten tart in the little bag and slipped in under the edge of my chair.  I fear to report to you that my beloved and faithful dog Brodie ratted me out and started snuffling and scratching and instantly my wife knew what was up.  It was heart breaking and humiliating.  She sarcastically retrieved the half eaten tart and gave it to the dog...right in front of my eyes!<br /><br />Anyway, these things are the best.  I love them and dearly wish I could pig on them again.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: My Pop Tart addiction story....
review/text: "Hello my nickname is Ragepoppa and I'm a Pop Tart addict."....that's really how it should go. My family has had countless interventions with me about my "Pop Tart problem" (so they call it). I say they just dont understand, mind their own business...let me be. It could never be so easy I say. I call it a devine love for gooey, sugary, frosty fruited, tangy-ness (yes tangy-ness) that only a Kellogs Pop Tart can deliver. I guess the real problem here is the fact that i've dragged others into my realm of over indulgence, namely my dog "Pop Tart" (thats really his name). The "crackling sound" of a Tart wrapper on the verge of being opened gives me such a rush and as far as eating Pop Tarts is concerned this (on any given night) is usually how it goes down.....<br /><br />Let me tell you this...<br /><br />Ok...In the middle of the night when everyones asleep (best time to eat a Tart) I am quite oftenly awakened from my sleep by the Pop Tart gods. I throw on my robe. I slowly sneek to the back of the house to the pantry as I can hear the gods calling me with every sneaking step. As I slowly, silently open the door the inner light of the pantry comes on, its like a beam of bright sunlight being shun upon me by Pop Tart heaven (sometimes i pinch myself to make sure that I havent actually met my calling cuz that's really how it is when we die right...bright light..colorful boxes of differnt flavored Pop Tarts everywhere inviting us, surrounding us, telling us its ok to just come to the light) anyway...As I "slowly" grab a package out of the box my dog (Pop Tart) can hear the "crackle" of the wrapper from the other side of the house while in a dead sleep (remember, my dog Pop Tart he has the same problem I do) It's like he's programmed to awaken from Tart package crackling...jeeze! By the time I'm in the kitchen and throwin these badboys on a paper plate (to microve for exactly 16 seconds I might add cuz thats how I roll with my Tarts) He is literally doing "flips" cuz he's so excited by what is about to follow (as am I). As always I silently wave my arms back and forth in a wild fashion trying to "hush" him as to "not wake momma" for she could bring a real damper to the pleasure for which we are about to engage in. Youd think by now he'd know the routine but "Noooooo.." Pop Tarts gotta do flips and run in circles and growl happily ("No Pop Tart No!!") as I find myself recklessly waving in silence in my boxers and robe and before you know it the microwave has already went "ding" and I find myself doing the same dance as him in the middle of the night in the kitchen trying to silence him while everyones trying to sleep so my wife and kids dont get up!!! This has become properly termed as the "Pop Tart kitchen dance" by my wife and kids as they know the sounds oh too well from being awakened so many times over the years by this embarrasing display that my dog and I have subjected ourselves to just to try to enjoy a good evening snack..<br /><br />Long story short....<br /><br />Sometimes we get busted and our Pop Tarts are taken from us (depending on how much noise we have just made) before we can enjoy them (bummer man...) Other times...and I mean the best times, we chill on the couch while Sports Center whispers on the T.V., a cold glass of milk is also in hand for the ride along and we really bond man...we really bond....its special..a man and his best friend enjoying a moment together. A moment that no one can take from us that we share.... A man, Pop Tarts and his dog. Sometimes I say to him..."We really did die and go to heaven didnt we Pop Tart."

review/text: On Monday August 22, 2011 the Pop-Tarts, Frosted Strawberry, 12-Count Tarts (Pack of 12) was $25.91 and was not available for subscribe and save.  The product is now priced at $32.89 and is available to subscribe and save for $27.96 08/24/11 the price went up in a matter of two days. The price of items or products on special do not go up in price they can be lower but not raised. Where do Amazon get its pricing scale from items are priced all over the place. You have customers paying different prices for the same items the only different is the flavor. Flavor does not determine the price of an item.<br />Amazon is trying to get over with these made up prices, lower the price when want to and raise them to make money on special offer for the month. Subscribe and save goes up often I purchased the Oreo pack of 48 three months ago for $15.13, a month before they were $15.30 now they are $15.98

review/summary: Has a ton of fillers, but the cats like the taste
review/text: Okay, I admit it.<br />I was sucked in my the most adorable, romantic commercials for a cat food product that I have<br />ever seen. I vowed to buy at least some Fancy Feast each week just to show my support for that commercial!  LOL<br /><br />The cats love the wet food. It is very expensive, and from what I have read on the labels, you are<br />definitely paying for the IMAGE, not the quality or quantity of the food. (The cans are only 3 ounces<br />compared with 5.5 ounces in the other can styles.) I still get it, and they love the ones with cheese the most.<br /><br />So, I thought we'd give the dry food a try. I had my husband grab a bag when he was at the grocery store.<br />How bad could it be, right?  Same company, same "gourmet" promotion on the foods, so surely it has great stuff<br />in it, right?  Well, shocker - NOPE.<br /><br />Fancy Feast is made by the Purina company in St Louis, MO. They are the same ones who make the generic dog chow,<br />cat chow, rabbit chow, ________ (fill in the blank) critter chow.  They are all full of fillers that animals don't need,<br />because it is cheap to manufacture. Why I thought this might be different, I do not know.<br /><br />First off, food mfgs have found the kitty equivalent of addictive MSG, and load their foods with it.<br />This one is no different. Note that BOTH our cats went crazy over this food, inhaling it out of my hand<br />before I could even get more out of the package. Fancy Feast knows how to make things that smell/taste good to cats.<br />However, most food mfgs know how to make things that TASTE good - how they got there, well, you might not really want to know.<br /><br />Here's the ingredients list (which is in the order of the QUANTITY of the item) for this "gourmet" cat chow - bear with me, this is<br />a really long list of iffy ingredients, artificial junk and food coloring):<br /><br />Brewers Rice<br />Poultry By Product Meal<br />CORN GLUTEN meal<br />Animal fat preserved with mixed tocopherols<br />Ground Yellow Corn<br />Soybean Meal<br />Animal Liver Flavor<br />Chicken<br />Turkey<br />Phosphoric Acid<br />Calcium Carbonate (in case they get indigestion?! This is what's in Tums!)<br />Salt<br />Natural & Artificial Flavors<br />Potassium Chloride<br />Dried Yeast<br />Choline Chloride<br />Added Color, Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 2 and "other colors" (Why?!?)<br />Taurine<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Ferrous Sulfate<br />Vitamin E Supplement<br />Niacin<br />Manganese Sulfate<br />Vitamin A Supplement<br />Calcium Pantothenate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Copper Sulfate<br />Riboflavin Supplement<br />Vitamin B12 Supplement<br />Pyridoxine<br />Hydrochloride<br />Folic Acid<br />Vitamin D3 Supplement<br />Calcium Iodate<br />Biotin<br />Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (a form of Vit K)<br />Sodium Selenite.<br /><br />Sounds yummy, huh?<br />The meat is way down the list, after all the corn, soybean and rice fillers and glutens.<br /><br />How on earth does cat food need artificial food dyes?  The cats won't care.<br />There are many known reactions to food dyes in people - I am sure our pets don't need it either.<br />Was the food too yellow with all the grain meal and gluten, or too white from all the fats?<br /><br />So, the cats love it. I will now consider this the equivalent of a bag of potato chips for humans -<br />okay some times, but NOT all the time. I'll have to watch our oldest cat. He gets super itchy with wheat<br />grain or gluten in foods, so I'll watch for reactions to the corn.<br /><br />Cats are carnivorous, and do not eat grains in the wild. However, especially with the manufacturing plant<br />smack dab in farming country, they can apparently get all kinds of leftover grains cheap?<br /><br />If you buy this for your kitties, just know that you are buying the IMAGE more than a quality food.<br />This is not really different than the super cheap pet food.<br /><br />Overall, I was really disappointed to read that ingredients list, when they could do SO much better for our pets.<br />We'll use this as their treats, rather than their main dry food. We'll stick with our Blue Buffalo for that, which is<br />grain free and actually has meat for the first ingredient!<br /><br />Fancy Feast - marketing genius, but sloppy on the nutrition.

review/text: I have been using this 4C Totally Light lemonade mix with Splenda for several years.  I initially purchased it at Walmart in the individual serving packets and then when WM stopped carrying it I started getting it direct from 4C in both the canisters and individual packets.  I'm glad I finally checked Amazon as it is half the cost versus getting it direct from 4C and paying shipping charges.  I really like the taste and when I use this lemonade mix I find that I drink more than when I recently tried to just drink plain water.  I do mix it half strength and like it fine that way.

review/text: I've been using B & M baked beans for probably 40 years. I've never found any better than B & M, because they use pea beans, which just have a better texture and flavor. I doctor them with brown sugar, a bit of instant decaf coffee crystals, dry mustard, and little smokies, a cocktail sausage. I also add some chopped onion and catsup. I've had many compliments at church suppers about my version of baked beans. Really yummy.

review/text: I grew up on these, so I'm sure I am biased.  I bought a case recently from Amazon because my local market stopped selling them.  I cannot stomach Bush's baked beans.  They are way too soupy and salty for my taste.  B&M's by comparison, are chock full of beans, and you can taste the natural spices and ingredients, along with that great bean flavor.  Sometimes, I'll add some BBQ sauce to spice them up a bit, but they are wonderful right out of the can.  Remember:  Beans, beans, the musical fruit, the more you eat, the more you toot!

review/text: I first had B&M beans in the 1960s. They were pretty decent for a canned bean. The current version tastes nothing like the 1960s version.<br /><br />I doubt they were using high fructose corn syrup when they began making beans in the 1920s either. I also suspect that the ingredients they are hiding by using the words "spice" and "natural flavor", were not used in the 1920s. And if "spice" and "natural flavor" are healthy ingredients, they should be proud to tell us what they are.

review/text: 6/30/2011<br />I followed the advice of a customer who commented on my initial review and contacted customer service. They were prompt in responding and are in the process of returning a prorated refund for the number of cans that arrived damaged.<br /><br />KUDDOS to Amazon!!!!!  Thank you.<br /><br />INITIAL REVIEW:<br />Great product. This order was for 2 cases. While i was told they would be shipped together, I got a subsequent message they would ship separately. The first one came and I was surprised it looked really beat-up, even though the shrink-wrapped package was also boxed with padding.  When I took the shrink-wrap off, about half of the cans were dented. This is obviously merchandise a supermarket would not be able to sell. I will be throwing away all of the dented cans, for fear of food poising.<br /><br />The second package came a week later and looked new (compared to the first one), clean shrink-wrap and no dented cans. Also the date stamped on the cans was a lot farther into the future.<br /><br />If all the product had been the same as the second package, it would have been a great deal and worth going on-line to get. Great product, not so great stock.<br /><br />Unfortunately, i doubt I will do this again.

review/summary: Pleasing strong fruit candy scent upon opening.  Tastes great but too sweet for 42 year old.
review/text: I love fruit leathers and fruit candies in general.  I like these much more than I though I would.  I thought the nerds decorations would get in the way, but the fruit candy is reasonably thick and chewy so the nerds just sort of vaporize while adding a subtle bit of texture.  My only concern with these is that they are too sweet.<br /><br />The package that I received is exactly as pictured.  Twelve translucent yellow plastic boxes with printed white question marks outlined in black.  The lids are opaque yellow and have a slight snap at each corner to keep in place when closed.  Label on the lid shows a photo of the candies.  Label on the bottom of the box shows nutrition info and UPC code.  There are eight individually wrapped candies in each of the twelve boxes.

review/summary: I LOVE coffee...
review/text: ...and I drink a lot of it. So I switch to decaf after the first 2 cups in the morning. To mix it up a little I throw in a little flavored coffee. Actually, I always mix flavored coffee half and half with non-flavored coffee because I prefer just a hint of flavor rather than being overpowered with it. Hazelnut is my first choice for flavored coffee. Cafe Excellence was a great find. Very rich flavor. Decaf coffee can sometimes be "weak". But not this. In fact I have had people question if it truly is decaf. The 2 pound bag is convenient and I store what I am not using in the freezer. I am ready to make my second purchase of Cafe Excellence coffee and I am going to browse their other choices, because if the Hazelnut Decaf is representative of all of their coffee, you can't go wrong!

The salame was first sliced - not too thin, but not too thick - and topped small pizzas that I made from scratch and cooked over wood coals. Not only does this salame possess its own wonderful, unctuous warmth, but it stands up well to high heat - much better than many pepperoni. It has become my new "standard" pizza topper.

review/summary: Good tea, but not a good value
review/text: This is good chamomile tea from Twinings. As its name suggests, each teabag (20 in each box) contains pure chamomile and each bag is individually wrapped in plastic-paper wrapper. Chamomile tea is an herbal tea made from a flowering plant. It's naturally caffeine free and is supposed to aid in digestion. It's often used as a mild sleep aid, and I find that it makes for a soothing cup of tea just before bed.<br /><br />However, I'd only buy this again if I found it at a very good price. I had tried chamomile tea from a generic brand, so I bought this Twinings version to see if a premium brand tasted any better. I did a blind taste test of this against Walmart's "Great Value" brand, and found little difference in flavor. The Walmart brand may have actually been a little stronger. But, for me, they were both equally good. This is probably because both Twinings and many generic brands of tea use only raw chamomile; rather then a blend. I've done the same experiment with Earl Grey, a blended tea, and Twinings has always tasted, in my opinion, far better than the generic brand. Generic teas are much cheaper though. A box of generic chamomile is often $1.99 or less for 20 teabags in store. I've seen Twinings chamomile sell for nearly twice that.<br /><br />The difference between this chamomile tea from Twinings and generic brands, is that Twinings wraps each teabag in a sealed plastic-paper wrapper. Many generic brands do not wrap their teabags. A sealed wrapper obviously helps to keep the tea fresh and prevents flavors from getting in or out. I've found that some teas, if simply left in the cupboard exposed to open air, will lose their flavor or absorb flavors from other foods after a few weeks. So if you take a month or more to drink through a box of tea, it's a good idea to have each teabag sealed in its own wrapper and then sealed in a jar.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is as good of a chamomile tea as I've tried and is well packaged. But chamomile tea from generic brands is often just as good but for a lower price. In the future I will stick to generic brands of chamomile tea.

review/summary: Precooked was not the way to go...
review/text: I really wanted to love this item. I have ordered from Burgers before. Their precooked smoked turkey is excellent. But I did not enjoy this prime rib. Why? I bought the 4-5 lb roast for Christmas dinner. I let it thaw in the refrigerator for 4 days and then set it on the counter for two hours to bring it up to room temperature so it would reheat evenly. I followed the instructions that came with the roast, preheated the oven and let it cook for about an hour at 350 degrees. As I was busy preparing the rest of the meal I felt confident the prime rib would turn out fine since it was already cooked. As I was finishing up the rest of the cooking in that last dash of chaos to get everything out on time I finally checked the temperature of the meat and was shocked to find it was only 80 degrees in the center!<br /><br />I know for a fact the entire prime rib was thawed so there is no way it was still cold in the middle before I put it in the oven. I didn't panic. Since my guests were waiting and everything else was finished I had to get this meat up to temperature quickly (to at least warm) in the center without ruining the perfect red color of medium rare. Unfortunately that meant putting this beautiful and EXPENSIVE piece of meat in the microwave. I had to run it on high for 1 minute intervals, constantly opening and closing the door until I got the center to 110 or so - at least so my guests thought it was warmed through. Because of how big the roast was, that process took about 10 extra minutes. Obviously it is impossible to cook a prime rib evenly in the microwave so I ended up with overcooked ends, well done second and third slices and a slightly pink center.<br /><br />As for the taste...what were they thinking? I tasted like it was injected with highly concentrated au jus. Each bite was too salty for my taste and there was a heavy flavor of beef broth and rosemary. I wanted to taste the beef, not the seasonings. It reminded me a little of carved roast beef you get in a cheaper chain buffet restaurant or cafeteria like Golden Corral.<br /><br />Are there any positives? Yes, I can't say I hated it outright. The meat itself was tender as a prime rib should be and the flavor while a bit overpowering, was edible. In fact, my in-laws said they liked it a lot (but maybe they were just being nice). Also, it was much bigger than I thought - that's a good thing. It easily fed 6 people and there was enough left for another 5 or 6 more slices.<br /><br />But for the $115 I paid I probably could have had the same results from my grocery store meat case. Sorry Burgers. I like your products but you blew it on this one. I won't be buying a precooked prime rib from you again.

review/text: This is a flavor, unlike any other.  When I add it to my rice, my rice tastes out of this world, and I just cannot get enough.  It's even worth the expensive price.<br />I hurt my rotator cuff, and it was sore and making popping noises when I moved it.  I googled & discovered that the other weightlifters had much success w/ fish oil.  I compared price per ounce of all the fish oils in the healthfood section, and they were all more expensive than this Red Boat fish oil.  Plus, I've bought those health-food fish-oils in the past.  They taste bland, sort of gross.  It seems like they try to hide the fishy taste w/ lemon.  It's rediculous!  Fish oil tastes great in rice!  There's no need to hide it!  I bought this stuff instead, and it tastes many-fold better than health-food fish oil, and it's cheaper.  I ate about 1/3 of a bottle on the first day I bought it.  The next day, the shoulder no longer makes popping sounds, and it's much better feeling.  Before I ate it, my shoulder hurt when I raised my arm.  After eating it, & a good night's sleep, the only way I can even  feel the sore muscle is by lifting the arm with a heavy weight.  Earlier, it seemed damaged, even after a good night's sleep, but after I ate this fish sauce & had another good night's sleep, it just felt sore, but only when lifting  a weight.  Now that's some great healing food!  "Let food be thy medicine"  This is a potent elixer.  Very strong taste, but in a good way, & therefore, a very healing elixer.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I want to know if it has farm-raise anchovies.  If there is such a thing.  I prefer raw, & want to know if it's raw or "pasteurized" to destroy all nutrients, vitamins & healthy "germs".<br /><br />I've tried many Asian fish sauces.  Almost all of them have either added sugar, GMO-soy, or MSG.  And the taste isn't nearly as good as this stuff.  Squid fish sauce is pretty good, but not nearly as good as this stuff.  Squid costs much less, but Red Boat's quality, taste, and lack of additives puts it head & shoulders above the rest.

review/summary: Lovely flakes of sea salt
review/text: There are many different varieties of sea salt out there.  What makes Maldon unique is its large, pyramidal flakes.  Some people use it for general cooking, but it really shines best as a finishing salt.  That means cook with less salt, but sprinkle salt on the finished dish.  You really get a chance to experience the unique characteristics (primarily texture) of each salt that way, and Maldon has a light crunch that I find very pleasant.<br /><br />Some people claim to be able to taste the difference between salts, but as long as there are no additives, I find all sea salts taste the same.  The pleasant texture and relatively reasonable cost make Maldon an excellent choice.<br /><br />Regardless of whether or not you buy this salt, try tasting a standard table salt next to a sea salt.  The iodine and anti-caking agents have a distinct and unpleasant bitterness.  If you're not willing to get spendy on sea salt, at least find a salt with no additives, something like Diamond Crystal Kosher salt.

review/summary: Wonderful Fragrant Smooth Tea
review/text: Arrived promptly in 2 days.  The tea was as advertised.  The loose tea comes in two air tight bags.  It arrives in the beautiful box pictured.  You could give this as a gift to someone who enjoys loose golden Oolong or green tea.  I enjoy drinking green tea and thought I would give Oolong tea a try.  The loose Oolong tea is fragrant and had a smooth taste and did not need any sweetening.  It tasted similar to green tea.  My boyfriend loves earl grey tea and he loved this loose golden Oolong tea.<br />The side of the box says, "High-Grade HuangJingGui  HuangJingGui (also named "Huangyan") has the special good quality of wulong Tea.  Which enjoys the landatory title of "penetrating Fragrance".  Its finished products appear curly and tight with a golden green colour.  And its consistent quality and special fragrance have become the favorite of generations of tea drinkers."

review/summary: Lovely scent, seems good quality, but too light for me
review/text: I have been drinking oolong tea for a few years now. I am used to the darker kind of oolong with a richer taste. In comparison, this kind of tea seemed a little too light for me, almost like green tea. It does not seem as oxidized and with less strong taste as the kind of oolong I am used to drinking. If you are looking for a strong, rich tea, this is not for you. This is a light, delicate tea, like green tea, in my opinion. It has a nice taste, but it's just not strong enough for me. I give it three stars because it seems good quality, came in nice packaging, vacuum-packed for freshness, etc.

review/summary: Ok for an oolong/wulong tea
review/text: This product is OK, but truthfully I've had much more fragrant and tastier oolong teas elsewhere. If you're not an oolong connoisseur I'm sure this brand would be fine...it's price point is decent and it comes in an especially pretty sliver and gold box. However if you really want a treat try a Formosa oolong in a fancy grade.

review/summary: Good Light Oolong
review/text: This Huangjin Gui is a light oolong with a floral scent and a light wooden flavor. The leaves are rolled and stay flavorful out to 4 or so steeps. Comes in two vacuum sealed bags inside the box shown. Lightly oxidized and tending toward the 'green' end of the oolong flavor spectrum. An excellent value for the price and one of the better Fujian teas on Amazon.

review/summary: Great herbal tea
review/text: Do you love the taste of licorice? If so, this tea is for you. I used to be able to buy it from retail grocery stores but they no longer carry it. It turns out that buying this online is about half the price of retail, so I win both ways (price & availability). I do not add sugar, milk or anything else to this tea. It is wonderful all by itself. However, just one bit of advice: Do NOT remove the bag after brewing. The tea is so mild, that I leave it in the cup the whole time I am drinking the tea.

review/text: I only tried this tea because it was provided free at my hotel in Oregon. That was a few years ago and I have been drinking this tasty tea ever since. You can add sugar if you want and it's good, but what I really love about this tea is that it is delicious with nothing added. Nothing's needed. Tea bag, hot water, steep, done, drink. Great for travel. Just stash some tea bags in your purse or pocket and if you have access to hot water you can have tea in an instant. I make this tea at work, too. Actually, I drink it all day long and never tire of the fresh berry taste.

review/text: You used to be able to find Stash Licorice at major grocery stores, and I'm baffled as to why it has disappeared from shelves and can only be found online. It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners. The aroma is heavenly and as an added bonus, it acts as an appetite suppressant (at least for me) because when you're inhaling that scent your palate doesn't crave anything else. Great as an after-dinner/before-bed drink.

review/summary: Licorice lovers and health nuts, this is for you!
review/text: If you love black licorice and and would like something that also has great health benefits, you'll love this tea.  I brew this tea and drink hot, but even when it gets cold, its still great.  I often just add more cold water to it and get a very mild licorice taste that is better than just strait water.  I will do this several times until I just want more of the licorice taste, and brew some more tea.  As to the health benefits, there are many.  Here are just a few: "useful for many ailments including asthma, body odor, bursitis, canker sores, chronic fatigue, depression, colds and flu, coughs, gingivitis and tooth decay, gout, heartburn, HIV, viral infections, fungal infections, ulcers, liver problems, Lyme disease, menopause, psoriasis, shingles, sore throat, tendinitis, tuberculosis, ulcers, yeast infections, prostate enlargement and arthritis."  See [...] and click on the link licorice.  That is where this health info came from, but there is much much more info there on that web site too.  It's said to be very good for flu and colds, which I'm fighting now, and it's so very SOOTHING to my throat!  You'll love this tea.

review/summary: A loyal drinker (!) for years
review/text: Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well.  Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some).  The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea.  It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect "unwinding" drink before bedtime.  Not "spicy" in the classic sense at all, either.  I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea.

review/text: I love the taste of this tea. It tastes exactly like licorice root and it's very refreshing. I like to make iced tea with it. However, I just read a review someone made on another licorice tea product on amazon, telling their story of licorice toxicity. I'm a fairly paranoid person, so I'm now only going to enjoy this tea about twice a week, instead of everyday like I was doing. I canceled my subscribe & save order because I don't think I can safely use up 6 boxes within the time I selected. I might be overreacting, I probably am, but better safe than sorry.

review/text: I will be honest and say that when a friend suggested I try this tea as I began getting sick last winter, I told her no way because I do not like licorice flavor.  She still made me a cup and I was stunned.  This is the best tea EVER!  I stopped drinking coffee during the winter and drank this tea all day long.  The students in my class noticed my new love of this tea and bought me a package as a gift.  The flavor is fabulous and I really like the fact that I do not need to add any sweetener at all.  The aftertaste is so interesting.  I have never had anything like it.<br /><br />I prepared this as a cold tea this summer, but it just didn't taste the same.  I will stick with it as a hot tea only.  Did I mention that I love it?

review/text: This tea is super gingery, and lemony, and I just love it with honey when I'm sick. Love it. My local grocery is out, so here I am on Amazon, buying more.<br /><br />Note that the primary source of "lemon" appears to be lemongrass. (Ingredients, via the product packaging: "Ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, and citric acid. Contains: Soy." I don't understand "Contains: Soy", but it's not listed on the ingredients... I wonder if this is an allergy alert thing.)<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients, the organic version has caffeine and doesn't have any actual lemon in it... I haven't tried that one yet, though. I'm a fan of both green tea and organic products, but I don't want caffeine when I'm sick, so I'll stick with this.

review/summary: Really Great Tea
review/text: A friend introduced me to Licorice Tea many years ago by asking for a cup at a restuarant. When the server stated that the restuarant did not have Licorice tea, she took a packette out of her handbag and asked for a cup of hot water. She had an extra packette for me to try. WOW, interesting taste, not bitter and no need for sweetner. Stash makes the most robust decafinated tea. Until a short while ago, I was able to puchase the 20 count box of Stash Premium Licorice Spice Herbal Tea at the local grocery, but Licorice Spice is no longer on the shelf. I placed my order for the Pack of 6 to save on shipping and should now have sufficient tea bags for several months. Individually, foil wrapped tea bags keeps the flavor fresh.

review/summary: Very soothing
review/text: Stash Licorice Spice tea is so soothing. I can't always drink a caffenated tea, although I love it. Before I have anything in my stomach, Licorice tea is wonderful and soothing. I can't find it anywhere else but at Amazon. It does not have a strong licorice flavor, which I know some people don't care for.

review/summary: super yummy sweet taste!
review/text: If you aren't familiar with the taste, I can only suggest you try it before you end up with 6 boxes of the stuff.  But if you are a committed lover of this tea, then Amazon's Subscribe and Save is REALLY a great deal!  Definitely not for people who do not like the taste of black licorice.  I personally steep the tea for longer than advised on the package but I like my teas strong (package says 3-5 minutes, I go for 10).  I have turned some of my licorice loving friends onto it - 1 is a diabetic and she LOVES it since it gives a really sweet flavor with NO sugar or carbohydrates.  It is wonderful on a cold evening and won't keep you awake as there is NO caffeine.

review/text: I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this tea! I don't even like licorice, my friend encouraged me to taste it, as she was so pleased with it. I did not realize (as the packaging box states) that herbal teas contain no true tea leaves, but are created from an international collection of herbs and spices such as licorice, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise and sarsaparilla. It is a perfect after dinner tea. I live in Michigan and those wintery nights are good for a cup of this caffeine free tea.

review/summary: The Best Tea!
review/text: I love Red Tea by Stash.  It is very difficult to find in my local supermarkets.  I asked if one would special order, and they hemmed and hawed.  So a friend suggested I check Amazon.com for the tea.  And in just a short time I had a huge stock of Red Tea.  It is great that this was so convenient and easy to shop.

review/summary: I like this tea!
review/text: Well, what's to be said other than I really like this Licorice Spice Tea?<br /><br />I cut out sugar and reduced my caffeine intake over the last year or so and this licorice tea is my favorite replacement for a caffeinated hot drink. Because I have a sweet tooth I usually now drink tea and coffee with soy milk to reduce the bitterness. This licorice spice tea is delicious and I drink it equally happily both with and without soy milk (the licorice gives it a natural sweet flavor). I have at least one or two cups a day, and even if I was to return to my previous high regime of caffeination I would still include a cup or two of this tea during the day.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of chamomile and this Licorice spice tea does not seem to list that as an ingredient.<br /><br />It seems many people don't like the flavor of licorice, but those that do really like this tea.<br /><br />I've found that the flavor of each batch seems to vary in intensity and the last batch I bought had a less strong taste which simply means it needs to be steeped a little longer.<br /><br />Scratching around for other things to say, my only concern about Stash teas is what appears to be plastic coated aluminum sashes that the teabags are sealed in. That does a great job in terms of sealing in flavor, but I'd rather it wasn't either plastic or aluminum coated. Maybe there's no good alternative.<br /><br />The only other thing is that the latest boxes have changed the design of the semi-circular hole at the bottom of the box and the new design makes it near impossible to easily remove a sachet. You'll be attacking it with the scissors or opening the box lid to get them out.<br /><br />But what really matters is the flavor and this is simply the best!

review/summary: Best Licorice Spice Tea!
review/text: Licorice Spice is my most favorite daily tea flavor. Earl Grey is what I take in the winter instead of coffee. Stash's Licorice Spice is very strong, not weak like some other teas I've tried with this flavoring. If you had a Licorice Spice Tea years ago and wondering if you should get this, just know I'm glad I did!
