review/summary: pretty good but not for me
review/text: Low cal and low carb. The flavor is mostly cherry but like the cran-grape drink mix there is some cranberry flavor in the background.<br /><br />I don't like it as much as the cran-grape <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RXG1SS">Ocean Spray on the Go Sugar Free Cran-grape 10 Per Box</a> flavor but it is OK. I probably won't buy anymore of it. It may be a personal taste kind of thing though. It was not nasty or anything. I just did not like the cherry flavor.<br /><br />I got it at a local store for $1.50 a box of ten envelopes of the drink mix. It did not hurt me any to try it out at that price.If you like cherry, it may be more to your liking than it was to mine.

review/text: EDEN ORGANIC APPLE BUTTER is the best apple butter commercially available. Just a slight tartness preserves the integrity of the apple flavor. The color is dominately brown with a bit of red that makes it, visually, more appealing. It reminds me of the apple butter that my mom used to make.

review/summary: HEALTHY, TASTY TREATS FOR YOUR CAT!
review/text: I found these on sale at the grocery store one time and figured, heck for $2 it won't be that bad if my cats don't like them...turns out, they LOVED them. There are so many different flavors and my cats adore these treats. You can't beat the healthy factor either. They're only 2 calories per treat which isn't bad - less than a stick of  sugar free gum. All I have to do is shake the bag and my cats come running! Whiskas definitely did something right with these cat treats because mine can't get enough of them. Would definitely recommend you try these out.

They all gather around and beg for more. I hope they're as healthy as they say cause this is the one thing my cats have yet to turn down.

review/summary: Tunalicious!
review/text: I volunteer at a cat shelter so over time I've had some experience with what cats like and what they don't.  With a few rare exceptions, it is hard to find cat treats that are popular with mostly all of the cats.  So far, Natural Temptations Wild Alaskan Salmon Flavor, Natural Temptations Tuna Flavor and All Natural Temptations Chicken Flavor are proving to be three of the rare exceptions.  Just about all the kitties love these things and will follow me around when I'm handing them out so they can cadge more.  Because they are all natural and only 2 calories per treat, they are a reasonably safe and nutritious treat.  Because they are inexpensive, I can afford to bring enough for everybody at every visit!  And apparently they taste awesome.  I can buy these at my local grocery, Target, Walmart or pet store for around $1.50 to $2.00 a packet and each packet contains enough treats to provide every kitty in the shelter with a generous serving of treats. There is one negative - these treats contain a lot of grains and as a result some kitties will vomit them up after an hour (some kitties tummies will not tolerate food or treats containing grain, or more than very small amounts of grain); over the last few months I've had 3 or 4 kitties through the shelter with this issue.  Once I've identified a kitty who is grain-intolerant, I naturally do not feed it these treats or anything similar.  Note that there are several versions of the Whiskas treats that are not all natural; the kitties like them also but I prefer to feed the all natural version.

Gevalia is rich bodied, not bitter and if you like Starbucks, you'll love this as well.  In a blind test, I dare you to taste the difference between the two!

review/summary: great way to make home espresso drinks
review/text: I'm not a coffee drinker and certainly not an espresso expert, but I like a cafe mocha (espresso with chocolate) in the morning during the winter.  After the machine makes the espresso, I open then reclose the top, and hit the start button to run hot water through the disk one more time.  Then I add skim milk (heated in microwave and then frothed with the Aerolatte) and some chocolate powder for a home cafe mocha.  Not as good as Starbucks, but its fast and much cheaper.  If you don't have an Aerolatte you need one - really improves the drink to froth the milk.

review/summary: excellent espresso
review/text: The Gevalia Espresso T- Discs provide an excellent Espresso coffee which is equal to or better than at Starbucks!<br />By experimenting with various combinations I found for those who like the Espresso with milk, use about an ounce and a half of REGULAR milk add the desired amount of either sugar or brown sugar or molasses or Hershey's syrup, in a twelve ounce cup, heat  that in microwave for 22 seconds, then use the milk frother(you can get one at Ikea for 99 cents) for a few seconds to get a light froth- do not over froth - then use that container in the Tassimo coffee machine with the Gevalia Espresso T-Disc, after brewing is complete, hold the brew button for 12 seconds more for additional coffee, after completion stir lighly and drink. I have found that you get almost similar but slightly less satisfaction with "King of Joe" Espesso T-Disc also. Would like to know other user's experience with this type of brewing.

The little stinker wanted them so bad he somehow jumped on the counter, knocked them onto the ground and ate the bag to get to the treats.  He did this the day after we got them.

They are large pieces for a small dog (we have a 6 pound toy poodle), but he doesn't have any trouble with them because they're not stiff.  They are also very easy to break into small pieces with your hands if you're using them for training.  They actually smell good, like beef jerky.  Highly recommended.

review/text: Our Bichon likes all the Zuke treats we've given him and he's been eating them for a few years.  However, he loves these chicken Z-filets!  We break up the filets since he's a small dog and they're high protein as well.  They're natural and made in the USA.  I've looked through Petsmart several times looking for made in the USA, natural, good-for-dog treats and the selection is very small.  So Zuke's is a great find.

review/summary: If this was an animal, wolves would exclusively hunt it.
review/text: Upon sniffing this treat, I've had dogs compulsively sit before me, wide-eyed and hopeful.  Even torn into impossibly tiny shreds (easily done with its maleable yet resilient texture), these morsels are gobbled up.  I had a dog actually excited over getting to eat the few crumbs left in my treat pouch which I fished out after the treats were gone.  I can't imagine the glee an entire one of these gigantic treats would induce.  So far, I've fed these in strips.  They're large; a palm-sized flat piece of jerky.  It has a softer texture than jerky; it's maleable, not easily crumbling or mushing together in a treat pouch, yet torn apart effortlessly by a human or canine.  They're perfectly chewy yet not moist, so they don't dirty your hands or surfaces.  They smell *FABULOUS*.  They're like a nicely seasoned steak.<br /><br />I use these for scenting/tracking (wonderfully effective and motivating), high-focus training, breaking bad habits and filling puzzle toys.  They're a little more expensive, but they last a lot longer if you remember to feed like a filet mignon, not like a Milkbone.  Also, if you subscribe to "treat value level" theory, having a few of these on hand during training is a lot easier "ace in the hole" than messy hot dogs, cheese or freeze-dried liver.  They're a high-value treat that's easy to store & carry.<br /><br />Four paws up.  (yes, they're defying gravity for these treats!)

review/text: My dog loves them, but I originally bought them because I wanted to switch over from the jerkey treats out of China.  For clarification these treats aren't jerkey....my dog gobbles them in about 1.5 seconds but she is greatful.  The best part about them is they are made in the USA so no worries about poisining.  The cons are they are EXPENSIVE for what you get.  But I guess anything in the US is going to be more expensive than China.  I'd rather support local than China anyday!!!!!

review/summary: Surprise disappointment from Zuke's - More like patties, not filets.
review/text: My girls, a year-old mini Dachshund and an 8-year-old Papillion-mix, love all things chicken. (They literally turn their noses up at most beef-based treats!) They already love Zuke's chicken mini naturals, so I expected them to go wild for these z-filets.<br /><br />Nothing doing. I am not too impressed myself. Compared to the product description, "basted chicken filet", what we received just doesn't match up. I expected something chewier, textured, meatier, and tougher. What I found wasn't a "filet" which implies whole-cut, but a soft "patty" a pressed ground bits. If I didn't know better, I'd think it was veggie-based! I should have read the reviews first, though I thought I could rely on the official product description and the overall excellent reviews.<br /><br />These treats are described as "ridged" to help "naturally clean dogs teeth and gums", to promote healthy oral hygiene. But what I received in the package (which looks just like the package depicted) is a thin, flat, and very soft which couldn't help clean teeth, especially when they aren't very chewy. Which doesn't matter anyway, since my snooty dogs won't eat them.<br /><br />I suspect their reticence has to do with the strong garlic smell coming off the patties. I think it stinks, but that's never stopped dogs from eating things before! I even expected them to perhaps think I was giving them "people food" since our food is highly seasoned. They didn't buy it. It's likely not chicken-y enough for them. Who can tell.<br /><br />I won't stop ordering Zuke's products, but I will be careful to read how reviewers describe them as opposed to promotional copy.

review/summary: My dog LOVES the chicken Zuke's treats!
review/text: My dog can be picky when it comes to treats and I always worry it's going to be a waste when I buy a new treat for her, but this product looked good and the description was in line with the kind of thing I like to feed her so I wanted to give it a try.  I don't want a bunch of filler or weird chemicals for my dog and thankfully there are a few companies out there that seem to agree, Zuke's being one of them.  In my opinion, the price is fair for the quality you receive and I never buy low-end dog treats anyway, so it seemed like a good deal in comparison to the prices I usually pay.  My dog LOVED these treats and ran to her treat jar hoping to get one ALL the time when we had some of these in there.  She "asks" for treats less often when it's something else in there like rawhides.  So, we both give this product 5 stars and we'll definitely be ordering them again as well as trying out the other varieties.  :)

review/text: To be frank, I purchased these as a 'filler' to get FSSS on an order for a Track Saw replacement blade.  Our Scottie enjoys the chicken treats as well as the venison.  The price was about the same as our 'premium' food specialty store, so I tossed them in on the order.  We haven't 'met' a Zuke's treat we didn't like!  Only one I don't care for is the 'Mini' version...just too small since we're not in training mode at ten years of age.<br /><br />Owing to the high 'natural' content of these treats, they are quite 'fragrant' and the aroma will hang around on your hands if you can't clean them soon after handling.  Can't complain too much about that...that's why they make dry treats as well!<br /><br />We'll keep a supply of these on hand, mixing with other 'natural' treat products from time to time. Our Katie-girl gives them 'two paws up' !

I say sneak because my two little dogs will storm me if they even see I've picked up the package.  I don't know that these would be cost effective for a large dog, but with my shihtzu and an equivalent size terrier mix, the pieces are big enough to break into perfect treat size as a reward for just looking so darn cute.

review/text: Like all the other Zuke products that I buy, this one is excellent quality. My pup loves it. I sometimes give her the whole thing after exercising. She gets so excited!! I have tried the beef and the bison, and they are both great. Never has a problem with upset stomach for that matter. Recommend for owners that don't buy treats from China and are looking for quality.

review/text: My dog goes bonkers for these treats. She's used to pretty good treats. I only use them when I want a lot of focus from her. Actually these get her head in a tizzy and she sometimes loses her focus. They are almost too good.<br /><br />The filets are a nice size and very clean to hold in your hand. I usually tear off little pieces because the whole filet would practically be a meal.<br /><br />Be careful with these around dogs you don't know!

review/summary: Chicken Jerky?????
review/text: I purchased this product because I wanted a safe, natural, USA made chicken jerky treat from my long hair chihuahuas.  This product appeared in the search "chicken jerky treats made in USA".  Both dogs loved the treat, but it is VERY crumbly and they stick together, tearing into pieces when you try to remove one from the bag.  It is NOT "jerky like" in any way.  My chihuahuas finished off one each in under 10 seconds. I am buying this product again, but will purposely crumble them and use them for mini treats/training rewards only.  If you are looking for something for your dog to gnaw on for awhile, this is not it...

review/text: My three dogs go crazy for these.  Actually, all Zuke's products they love.  These are a tasty treat (so the dogs tell me) that  can be easily broken into smaller bites for smaller dogs.<br />The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is I believe it makes their poops a little softer which I don't particularly like.  That said, I will continue to buy them because the dogs love them so much.

review/summary: Change the image for Chicken Flavor
review/text: I thought the chicken was going to be hard like chicken jerky, but instead it is completely different. The chicken is very soggy, flimsy, and smells terribly bad. Plus they should change the picture for the chicken flavor, because that's not the correct bag. In the picture the chicken looks hard and tasty, But when I received this it looks completely different. I got this for my Pomeranian, but he despises it. But he likes other chicken treats that look like the one in the picture. If you think your dog likes chicken flavored treats don't get him/her this one. I am rating the product on the way they display it. Not on the actual treat because Pomeranian's are picky. Just get this. (Dogswell Vitality for Dogs). If you think their to big then break them into smaller pieces. It may be more expensive, but it's a whole lot better.<br /><br />I contacted Zukes and they said the pictures that amazon shows are old and not updated. They told me they are supposed to be this way, but no biggie because they  send me 2 replacement bags and samples of the prime venison strips, very berryz, and mean greenz dog treats. My dog likes all of the samples but not the chicken still. Get the Venison instead of the chicken. Much better. Excellent service!

review/summary: My dog loves these and I think they smell awesome
review/text: Like any treat that smells good a piece eventually wound up in my mouth.  They actually taste pretty good but have the texture of cardboard but who cares right?  My dog loves these.  I hold different treats in front of her then let her choose which one she wants and these won over everything else so far.  I break them up into pieces and mix them into my treat bag with the minis for our walks.  When something especially distracting, like a strange dog, comes into view I pull one of these to snap her out of it.  So far out of every treat I've tried these seem to work at the closest distance which says a lot.<br /><br />I ordered a couple more beef and a couple of chicken.  Yes, they're extremely expensive especially if you do the math to see what the $/pound is but it's worth it and I love the knowledge they're made of the best ingredients and made in the USA.  I'm becoming a big fan of Zuke products.<br /><br />Update (Feb 8, 2011): I received my chicken and they smell and actually taste delicious!  The texture is really soft too compared to the beef.  I hold various treats in front of my dog to see which she prefers and the chicken won out over the beef.

review/text: I got these treats because my dogs can always use another  bag of treats and I needed a $5 item to get the Amazon free shipping. The bag is very small but these treats look, feel and smell like "people food". I did not taste them but someone told me they were also for people I would have believed it. It actually smells just like fresh chicken. My dogs go nuts over these and I love my dogs. If you want a special treat for your dog this is the way to go.

review/summary: Amazing! Zuke's For the Win!!
review/text: I have been giving my dogs the zuke's bones (fresh breath) to help with their teeth regularly for the past three years. I saw the venison filets on here when i was ordering another batch of bones and figured why not? I opened the package and took a sniff. They don't smell very good (to me) but as soon as I opened them my dogs took a quick sniff of the air and came running across the room to my feet, licking their lips! So I break 1 filet in half and give them each a half. They devour it and are still looking for more. Zuke's have never disappointing me. I am now a regular purchaser of the bones (fresh breath), filets (venison), and the small training treats (peanut butter).

review/summary: Order from E-Pets Galore
review/text: Shortly after I wrote my first review I received a phone call from D.J. at E-Pets Galore.  We had, what I thought, was a very pleasant conversation.  She apologized that I did not receive the correct items I had ordered.  D.J. told me that I would receive the items I had originally ordered at the latest by the end of the following week after our conversation.  She explained to me that it would not be worth it to send back the items I received in error.  I told her I would donate them to a local Animal Rescue compliments of E-Pets Galore.  Which I did.  I was very happy that D.J. had taken the time to contact me.  Our conversation had gone so well that I had decided I would do business with E Pets Galore in the future. I trusted her words.  I told D.J. that I would edit my orignal review at amazon once I received the correct items.<br /><br />It is now 2 1/2 weeks later and I still have not received the items that I had originally ordered and that D.J said I would receive by at the latest the end of last week, April 3, 2009.  I have left two messages for her and have not received a return call.<br /><br />Since I have already donated the 25 items to a local Animal Rescue, based on trusting and believing what D.J. said, I have financially lost $91.49.  The one positive from this awful experience with E-Pets Galore, is that some Animals in need will have some treats that otherwise they would not have had.<br /><br />I am very sad that this experience has turned out this way,<br />Fran B.

review/summary: Very nice pasta
review/text: I'd been looking for this pasta shape ever since Trader Joe's stopped carrying them a few years ago. These artisanal trottoloni -a.k.a. "nodi marini" because they resemble nautical knots- have a very nice texture/flavor and the spirals catch sauces. They're perfect for hearty sauces and cook to a nice al dente consistency in 12 minutes (leave them one extra minute in the cooking water, off heat, for silkier texture).<br /><br />Amazon's price is not as good as TJ's (I used to pay $1.99/bag back then) but at $4.58/bag, and free shipping, it is the cheapest I've seen so far online, anywhere from $6.50 to $12 per bag plus shipping - who pays that kind of money for dry pasta, anyway?

review/text: Namaste baking mixes have fulfilled an empty spot in my diet- that spot reserved for comfort food, sweet tooth fulfillment, and just plain convenient yumminess!<br />Since my diagnosis of celiac disease, I have been unable to find anything as remotely delicious as the regular cakes and brownies... that is, until being turned on to Namaste's goods. I first tried the Chocolate Cake, was floored by how scrumptious it was, then went through every item on their website until finding my absolute favorite: the Brownies. YUM!!!! Even sharing them with my wheat tolerant friends, they were unable to find any difference between them and the regular ones. In fact, most preferred mine! What better compliment could one get?<br />And when I was experimenting, one time I flubbed a recipe, and after calling Namaste's 1-800 number, the lady was super helpful: she guided me through another try of it, and even sent me a complimentary mix replacing the one I'd messed up. How cool is that???<br />Five stars for sure!!!!

review/text: My dad is the chocolate eater in my family and I do intend to review his favorite chocolates soon.<br />This one he hasn't tried yet. I did recently. The 3.5 ounce bars are generously sized and going by the information on the package, 10 squares is a serving. I'm actually eating the bar I picked up 2 squares at a time.<br />This is a shade grown, fair trade chocolate. So it's pretty guilt free. It's a very nice chocolate, very milky and smooth. One you can allow to just dissolve on your tongue and it never gets grainy. The flavor has shades of bright berry in the after taste as well as the expected chocolate flavor. It's absolutely not bitter.<br />I suspect this will become a favorite bar for those few times I want chocolate.<br />Imported from Germany.

review/summary: The most delicious chocolate I have EVER had
review/text: I dont care whether it is fair trade or not. There are criticisms of the honesty of claimed fair trade, but this chocolate is so good, who the heck cares! I am definitely ordering a box as soon as I finish my Lindor truffles.<br /><br />It is grown in Ghana and processed in Germany. I guess it is like footballer J&eacute;r�me Boateng!

review/text: I love chocolate and the Divine brand is my favorite. The taste is light and creamy, nice and cocoa-y; if you are reading this review, wondering whether or not to try Divine, you should! It doesn't just taste good, it is fair traded and you can feel really good about where your money is going.

review/summary: Do the Math
review/text: The product description states that this item contains 12 six-ounce packets.  That is 72 ounces of pectin at a total cost of $43.99.  This  comes to $0.61 per ounce.  A previous reviewer stated that pectin should cost about four dollars for six ounces.  Assuming this to be true, then the acceptable price of pectin comes to about $0.67 per ounce, well within the ballpark figure the reviewer suggests.  Cost-wise this comes to a savings of $4.32 (not including S/H) over the reviewer's suggested price.<br /><br />I have never shopped for or used pectin -- yet -- so I cannot vouch for the quality of the product itself.  However, the price does not seem to be a negative factor, hence my rating.<br /><br />RDB

review/summary: Great Noodle Replacement
review/text: In the interest of full disclosure and for you purists out there, I'm letting you know that this is a duplicate review.  I have put this same review on the six pack version of these noodles.  It is, after all, the same product, just a different quantity purchase so reviewing it in both places seemed reasonable enough to me....<br /><br />Those of you who know me know that I don't eat pasta or carbs and am forever on a quest to find noodle substitutes that don't feel like a compromise. A couple of years ago I bought and reviewed a turning slicer, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Y9WHQ">World Cuisine A4982799 Tri-Blade Plastic Spiral Vegetable Slicer</a> which I still love and use frequently to turn assorted vegetables into great noodle alternatives. Recently someone mentioned these kelp noodles and I decided to give them a try. Oh my, these are phenomenal in every way. Don't like to cook? Don't worry, these noodles don't require cooking. You CAN cook them, but you don't have to. It has only been a couple of weeks since I've found them so I haven't tried a large assortment of recipes but everything I have tried so far has been fabulous. Cold noodles with sesame sauce was a hit with everyone. These noodles are slightly chewy like pasta but they are also kind of crunchy like bean sprouts. They are thin like regular spaghetti and crystal clear like cellophane noodles. In and of themselves they have a delicate and refreshing taste with no weird smell like some of those other noodle alternatives. They are a wonderful size and texture and they hold thick sauces really well. Everyone who has tasted the cold noodles with sesame sauce has moaned with delight and licked their plate clean. I've also tried these noodles with a ramp pesto (slightly spicier than a basil pesto) and they held up so well with that sauce, too. The Ramp pesto was another crowd pleaser.<br /><br />If you are on a lo carb diet or lo calorie diet or a raw diet, vegan diet, vegetarian diet, or lo cholesterol diet, these noodles are a must have item. According to the package nutritional info, there are only around 20 calories in a pound of the noodles. There is no sugar, no cholesterol and only 1 carb per serving (3 servings in the bag). And they are made from sea kelp so they have lots of good nutrition.<br /><br />To be sure, I was VERY skeptical when I first tried them. I can be VERY squemish about new foods, particularly some of these weird, healthy alternative foods. I also have a very sensitive stomach that revolts easily when it is displeased with my menu choices. I was so afraid that they would smell like old shoes or taste like that horrible stuff you have to drink before a colonoscopy, but to my surprise and delight, there is no smell and no weird taste to get used to and my stomach has remained quiet and satisfied. In fact, I am beginning to wonder if they are too good to be true. The cynic in me is waiting for the other shoe to drop, so to speak.<br /><br />Its not simply that these noodles don't smell or taste bad, its that they actually are so so so GOOD and they are fun to eat. They have a clean and refreshing quality to them. I am enjoying coming up with recipes to showcase them but honestly I am not sure if I can top the sesame sauce. I have yet to try them with traditional Italian pasta sauces, but I have a feeling they would be great with a hearty marinara. They are a natural for all sorts of Asian cuisine. I bet they'd make an amazing base for Pad Thai. If you do try them and find recipes you like, please post back here and let me know.<br /><br />So, to recap (for those of you who don't like to read a lot of text):<br />no cooking required (but you CAN cook them)<br />taste great<br />unbelievably lo calorie<br />lo cholesterol<br />lo carb<br />no sugar<br />versatile<br />healthy<br />holds up well to sauces<br />no weird taste, texture or smell<br />much much much better than shirataki noodles (in my opinion)<br /><br />The Bottom Line: If you use these in place of pasta I am pretty sure you wont feel like you are settling for second best. These are a class act. Their only flaw seems to be the somewhat steep pricing, but isn't this true of all relatively new foods?

review/summary: Really nice crunch!
review/text: First bite was kind of a "hmmm" but then they really grew on me after a couple more.  They have a nice chocolate flavor, although it is not overpowering.  The sunflower seed flavor gives it a nice, nutty kick.  Very crunchy, which I personally like.<br /><br />At 10 calories a "nugget", they are a good little crunch without a lot of calories.  If you can keep from eating an entire bag.  Or two.  :)<br /><br />Picky teenage daughter says, "they're not bad.  Pretty good".  Husband says they are more like a cracker, but he likes them.  I'm hoping they grow on daughter more as they'd be a great healthy addition to her lunches.

review/summary: Winner in the healthy team snack competition!
review/text: Okay, there was no competition. But that doesn't mean that these babies didn't fly fast!  Specifically the Somersault Dutch Cocoa flavored snacks are the most popular item in my mini snack bar in my office. My team sneaks in all the time to eat them, even stealing them when I'm out for a meeting, and now I have no more left! I wish the bags were a little smaller, because I often can't finish a whole bag. Other than the fact that there are like 20 pieces in a bag, these snacks are the winner of the healthy team snack competition! (That I didn't have, but you get the point.)

review/summary: Filling
review/text: I tried the salsa, cinnamon, and this chocolate flavor.  Of the three, I like chocolate best.  This snack does a pretty good job of being filling when you are hungry.  However, you should watch how much you eat and go by the serving size as they are somewhat calorie dense.  Of course, no more so than chips or something.  They contain all natural ingredients if that's important to you.  Bottom line, they taste good, are filling, are natural, but don't have an really appetizing appearance.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised!
review/text: When I put the first few bites into my mouth, I was expecting something not so tasty.  After a few crunches, I was pleasantly surprised.  I liked them.  I'm not typically a 'healthy snack' kind of person and, in looking at the ingredients, I fully expected to dislike these snacks.  After a few handfuls, I offered some to my 4 year old.  He took two into his mouth and immediately asked for more.  Needless to say, he's not into healthy snacks either.  But ate the rest of the bag!  Impressive cocoa flavor - and you get the added benefit of feeling good about your snacking!

It is also something I would offer to my grandchildren as a change from sweets.

I especially love it on eggs, cottage cheese, and avocados; but I use it in/on everything that I would use salt in/on. It allows you to use less salt and still get a great flavor. I also prefer it over other spike seasonings due to it's fine grind - a little goes a long way and it isn't crunchy. I just moved to an area where I can't find it in the stores, so happy to find it on Amazon!

review/summary: Chocolate heaven
review/text: Well well, here's another matcha that took my tastebuds by surprise. I ordered the Belgium Chocolate matcha expecting, well, I didn't know what to expect! Haha.<br />I've never had a chocolate flavoured green tea before, but for some reason I didn't even blink or flinch at the thought of a chocolate matcha. It must be the faith in flavour that Red Leaf has instilled in me - if cotton candy works, why not chocolate, right?<br /><br />There were a few more reasons I sprung for the chocolate - I had also ordered the strawberry and knew they would make an amazing pair! (Chocolate covered strawberry matcha, how sexy!), but I also have caramel and cheesecake matchas which it would also blend well with! Let's not forget a chocolate covered banana iced latte (might add a little bit of english toffee in there as well for a Skor effect!)<br /><br />What can I say? I feel like a matcha mad scientist. I've got a blending itch that I have to scratch!<br />What took me by surprise was just how chocolaty the smell and flavour was! The cocoa powder used in the blend must be of quality, because it is leagues better than the no-name powder in my cupboard. It's silky and rich and has the quality of drinking chocolate. When I'm drinking it straight, I'm tempted to throw in a dash of cinnamon and cayenne for a Mexican hot chocolate flavour. Or maybe experiment on the savoury side with a matcha mole sauce - I would definitely be feeling like a mad scientist with that one, but hey why not! If the Food Network did something like that no one would bat an eye ;)<br /><br />So far my favourite way to enjoy this matcha is as a hot latte with all the fixings! I whisk up 1.5 teaspoons of matcha with just enough water (175 F) to make a paste. I then add about a half of cup of water (same temp) and sweetener (white sugar for me) and whisk some more to dissolve the sugar. A simple syrup would also work! Now I heat up � cup milk and cream (half and half) in the microwave and froth it up with my milk frother. Add the half and half to your matcha, top with whipped cream and chocolate shavings! This treat is oh so comforting, and could even be recreated with soy/almond milk or 1% for a light but indulgent treat!<br /><br />Before this matcha I hadn't found a flavoured tea of ANY kind that was a "replacement" for treats. Yes, I am in love with the cheesecake matcha - but it doesn't replace my cravings for a big fatty piece of creamy thick cheesecake. Nor does a chocolate cake tea turn me away from the frozen McCains delight sitting in my freezer. This tea, however, DOES cure my craving for chocolate and hot chocolate! Sometimes I get a real hankering for a package of powdered hot "chocolate" - but I don't even consider this a "substitute" - it's the real thing!

review/summary: Renew my faith in Matcha
review/text: I should mention that my first experience with matcha was not a positive one. We had bought a pouch of matcha from a tea store that shall not be named, and my fiance spent some time looking around on the internet figuring out exactly how much matcha to use for a cup of tea. Needless to say, it didn't go terribly well. I took one sip, looked at her, and said "Are you serious, you actually want to drink this?". Except it also involved swearing.<br /><br />I put my interest in matcha on a back burner at that point. Maybe it was something a future, more refined me would enjoy, but definitely not today.<br /><br />Then, Red Leaf Tea started showing up and making a huge effort to bring in new customers from Steepster. Reviews started popping up about their fantastic matcha, and the awesome flavors that they have. When the Belgium Chocolate Matcha went on sale, I knew it was time to give matcha another try. I figured, if I can't enjoy half-priced, chocolate flavored matcha from what appears to be the best matcha vendor around, there was probably no hope.<br /><br />For preparing this, my fiance used her battery-powered frother, as opposed to the traditional matcha tools. It may be bucking convention, but it really seems to create a nice, smooth evenly distributed cup of matcha. This resulted in a smooth, but murky jade green drink, which is significantly darker than the matcha-that-shall-not-be-named. This makes it obvious that there is true cocoa powder in here, as opposed to just a flavoring (unless there was a flavoring and a coloring, then all bets are off).<br /><br />It definitely smells very chocolatey, very sweet without any sugar added. It reminds me of a chocolate cake batter, or possibly muffin batter. There's the chocolately sweetness to it, but the hint of background... well, I suppose it's the smell of the matcha itself. Anyway, the matcha smell in the background elevates it a little bit to a baked-good smell, at least for me.<br /><br />The taste is very smooth. At first, it has a warm hot cocoa flavor to it, absolutely delicious. It is inviting, and comforting, with a subtle sweetness on your tongue (much more subtle in taste than in smell). To me, the first drink was overwhelmingly cocoa flavored, with no vegetal taste to betray the matcha lurking below. Each successive drink makes that matcha flavor come out a little bit more. There is a strangely beneficial aspect to this, and that is that the matcha flavor itself slowly builds on you. It's very crisp and clean, lightly foresty but without that swampy, seaweed taste that some green tea comes with.<br /><br />As you get to the end of the drink, there is some matcha that has settled towards the bottom. This is likely because I'm a little bit of a slow drinker, sensitive to hot liquids and such. Or, we really have no clue what we're doing. Always a possibility.<br /><br />All in all, I would definitely recommend this matcha, especially if you're new to the world of matcha. It has renewed my faith in matcha as a viable beverage choice.<br /><br />You can also get this from Red Leaf Tea's website, with a staggering number of different options.

review/summary: Matcha + Cocoa = Heaven
review/text: If you've ever had drinking chocolate, you know it can be a bit much to handle. Drinking this tea is like having matcha combined with drinking chocolate. It has cocoa powder added, so it has that bittersweet chocolate flavor without the additional sweetening and flavor ruining of your usual hot chocolate. Oh, and of course, it's matcha, so it's far better for you. The only complaint? Well of course, it's not extremely chocolatey but sadly I think I am always going to be stuck in the camp of things never having enough chocolate. Still, it's delicious.

review/text: An awesome item reminiscent of the good old Mega Man E-Tanks.  Stock up on 9 before you go off to battle Dr. Wiley and his 8 Evil Robots.<br /><br />A must have for every home, especially if you live in a community with robots.

review/summary: Quaker Corn Cakes
review/text: Have been put on a rather restricted diet in the last year due to a crazy disease that does not tolerate acidic foods.  It's kind of a trial and error thing of what I can tolerate.  Rice/corn cakes seem to be acceptable and help satisfy my "munchies" without adding a lot of calories.<br />The order was delivered in a timely manner and product was fresh and intact.

review/summary: Really good quality salt.
review/text: I have been using this salt for 5 years now and it is really good. My whole family is addicted to this stuff.  Taste better than regular salt and it doesn't contain the harmful flowing agents that table salt has in it. Since it is natural, it is also more balanced with other important minerals in it.

review/summary: I love this salt
review/text: Most salt sold to the public is nothing but industrial waste. This salt is full of all the trace minerals and has an absolutely WONDERFUL taste. I have been buying it at the local Natural Grocers/Vitamin Cottage in the one pound bags but last time I went to buy it they were out of stock. So on a lark I checked Amazon and found a five pound bag available for a much lower price per pound. And it was Prime to boot.<br /><br />FWIW I do not buy into the salt is bad for you meme perpetrated, and perpetuated, by the big food companies so they can sell low sodium foods at exorbitant prices and high profits. I use more salt than anybody I know (you might guess that - as how many people buy a five pound bag of salt!) and at 60 my blood pressure runs between 113/76 to 112/73.

review/summary: Wonderful fine grind--easily mixes in liquid for supplementation
review/text: I already had a 5 lb. bag of coarse-grind Celtic Sea Salt in my pantry and use it daily.  However, I supplement with 1/2 tsp. sea salt daily, mixed in some low sodium V-8, for my thyroid/adrenal issues (it has all the essential minerals that table salt does not), and the coarse salt was a difficult swallow.  So I bough the fine grind and it's been like night and day!  I don't notice any gritty salt residue in the bottom of the glass--it dissolves in the juice perfectly.  And buying it through amazon saved me the shipping charge of getting it elsewhere.  I'm a happy camper.

review/summary: Good salt for a good price.
review/text: As a mother of three and natural food cook, I loved the convenience of ordering this salt through amazon.com. Buying natural salts locally is much more expensive than buying it in bulk like this, and I use it for everything: baking, stir-frying, salad dressings, soups and stews, and most importantly, lacto-fermentation (natural pickling of vegetables). It works great for all these things, and tastes wonderful, too. It came in the mail very promptly. My only caution: the grains of salt are larger than that of commercial salt and you probably will not be able to use it successfully in an average salt shaker. I know that the salt shaker I have does not work with it; only a tiny bit comes out at a time, which is very frustrating. I put it in a used container for dried herbs, which has bigger holes, and shake it out of that. This works perfectly, and I'm reusing something rather than throwing it away, so I'm happy. :)

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: I never thought one salt was different from another but wow!  This salt is special.  It is very flavorful, not fishy!  It really enhances the flavor of food.  I add a little salt when I make a sweet food and it brings out the sweetness.  For example, add a little salt to the boiling water before you add the oatmeal.  Yumm!  Fantastic Salt!!!!

review/summary: Best gluten-free/vegan pancake mix!
review/text: I've tried almost every gluten-free/dairy-free pancake mix out there. This is by far the best. There are instructions to make them vegan, which is really simple and the result is actually a fully cooked fluffy pancake. I didn't think that was possible with the strict diet that I am on. Plus the mix is made with organic brown rice flour as opposed to white rice flour, which is a whole grain and healthier for you, and sugar is the 4th ingredients not the 1st! I definitely feel like I am eating a healthy breakfast when I have these organic pancakes!

review/summary: Barritts ginger beer
review/text: This ginger beer is, from what I've been told is the original ginger beer that was used to concoct the now famous "dark n stormy". The product did not disappoint. My order took almost a month to arrive though. The first shipment was damaged in transit by FedEx. The second shipment arrived fairly quickly courtesy of UPS. Second shipment was one bottle short of a full 24 bottles.

review/summary: It seems expensive but it's very cost effective
review/text: The manufacturer describes this better than I can.  I've been using their products for years with fantastic results.  It lasts for years in the refrigerator -- but it does get tough -- so use it within 6 months if possible.  It's a pleasure to look at the nutritional information and see that one quart of reconstituted stock contains a mere 310mg of sodium (13% of DV).<br /><br />Chicken Stock Reduced to Glace - A 20-time reduction of French chicken stock with deep, rich, toasted color and syrupy consistency. Glace de Poulet Gold� provides pure, intense flavor when used to enhance finished sauces or when deglazing directly in a roasting or saut&eacute; pan. It can also be used to enhance your stocks by adding 1-2 oz. per gallon, bringing deep flavor and roasted color to every batch of stock you make.<br /><br />Glace de Poulet Gold� is the first classic French chicken stock made to the standards of professional kitchens. This is no ordinary chicken stock. Glace de Poulet Gold� requires more than 24 hours of reduction to achieve its deep, rich, roasted color and syrupy consistency. The pure, intense flavors are made using only the finest natural ingredients, NO CHEMICALS, PRESERVATIVES, MSG, or SUGAR.<br /><br />One ounce (45g) of this amazing product yields 2-1/2 cups (450ml) of classic chicken stock that can be used for all your cooking needs. Or, use it with six parts water to one part Glace de Poulet Gold� to enhance the flavor and color of dozens of classic sauces. If you are looking for intensely flavored chicken stock without the salty flavor, try Glace de Poulet Gold�.

review/summary: Really excellent!
review/text: This truly gourmet product is gluten-free, corn-free and soy-free (try finding that combination anywhere else!). It is rich in flavor, yet low in sodium. A little goes a long way, so I find that the 16 oz. container is actually quite economical. And once opened, it stays fresh in the refrigerator, unlike the liquid broth sold in cartons. I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it.

review/summary: Excellent Sauce Base
review/text: I use all these More Than Gourmet sauces as a base for our dinners. Saute chicken breast or boneless thighs (or in the case of the beef sauce a steak, or shrimp in the case of the seafood MTG base) and when done remove from pan and add some chopped shallot or onion and garlic and saute a bit, add a half cup of wine and about a tablespoon of the MTG base and simmer to reduce a bit, Remove from the heat and add a tablespoon of cold butter and stir into the sauce until it melts, serve over the sauteed chicken, voila, instant gourmet dinner in about 10 minutes.
