review/summary: Deliciously tasty
review/text: This brought me back to my childhood. My dad would always take us kids to the grocery store and buy us each a squeeze pop! There were so good and so easy to eat. My mom would be so upset that he bought them for us because they were also so sticky and boy did we make things sticky. I was so excited when i purchases these because while they do still sell squeeze pops in the stores, they only sell the sour variety now and it's just not the same. I don't like the sour ones, i'd wander through the aisles hoping that just maybe they would be stocked with the original version, but to no avail. I am very pleased that I now know where I can get some! :D

review/summary: best seasoning ever!
review/text: My family and I stumbled on this seasoning in our local grocery store. We LOVE to use it to season steak, burgers, ribs, even chicken!  The store stopped carrying it, so to Amazon I went. We highly recommend this as the best seaoning for meat!

review/summary: OMG!!!  what a toy!
review/text: Literally from the second I unwound the string from the wand my male cat went CRAZY!!! The jumps, bounds and excitement this toy creates are truly fun and inspiring to watch and create (laugh out loud fun, and many loud sighs of wow! oh! etc).<br /><br />You won't want to put this toy away - and your kitties won't want you to either (they are crying for it right now!)  It's never been so much fun to play with this toy.  My three are about 5 months old and full of energy - but this toy really works them out - you can see the panting and feel their little hearts beating - but they don't want to stop!!!<br /><br />I wish my house was bigger so they could really bound far without having to occasionally bounce off furniture and walls.  I am tempted to try it out in my backyard to see how high they really could jump!

review/summary: Great workout
review/text: This toy provides a great workout for your cat.  The thing I appreciate most about it is that it's manufactured in the USA, so I felt good about buying it even before the cats got to try it out.  I have foster kittens who absolutely go nuts over it.  My older, lazier, cats also like it a lot, although they prefer to sit and swat at it as it buzzes past them.  This toy requires supervision or the feathers will be history.<br /><br />Great exercise, made in America, cats love it.  What could be better?

review/summary: My cats are addicted!
review/text: I picked this up at Petco after seeing something similar on TV. My cats couldn't wait for me to get it out of the package. I had 2 of them at my feet trying to get at it as I was struggling to remove the tape that holds the string in place in the package. Once I actually got the toy in action, there was no stopping them. My little couch potato was jumping for it like it was a real bird, and my toy-hater thought it was the greatest thing ever. Cat number three was very interested at first, but then I think he got intimidated by roughhousing of the other two.<br /><br />I was able to compare this side by side in the store with the Das Bird toy and I opted for this one because the Das Bird has a little metal loop where the feathers connect to the string. I felt that the loop was a risk for a cat getting a tooth or claw stuck. The Feline Flyer has no such loop.<br /><br />Also, I read reviews of Das Bird that mentioned that the fiberglass handle would sometimes leave painful splinters in the cat owners' hands. I saw no such reviews for Feline Flyer, but to be extra safe, I wrapped the rod from tip to tip in electrical tape.<br /><br />One note to those considering this toy - you need a bit of open space to really use the toy to its full advantage. The rod is about 2 and a half feet long, with the string being just a bit shorter. It takes a bit of creative handling in a small space to get a decent range of motion. And whatever you do, don't let the feathers sit on your lap when you think your cat is tired out. Young cats catch a second wind quickly and if you aren't paying attention, you may end up with claw marks on your lap. (Not a mistake I will make again!  LOL)<br /><br />My only regret is that I didn't grab an extra package or two of feathers while I was in the store. I can see that these are going to take quite a bit of abuse from my wild little bunch!

One of the feathers came out, super easy fix, so not a huge deal, I just wish it wouldn't have broken SO soon.<br /><br />As far as my cat's opinion on this toy, she loves it. My cat is fairly picky about what toys she plays with a lot. This is one she actually will move for!

review/summary: Best Toy EVARRR!!
review/text: My spoiled kitty has lots of fun toys, but this is HANDS DOWN his most favorite toy to play with!  He loves to hide and watch as we flick it around, then go in for the attack.  He will jump, flip, chase and pounce on it; whatever it takes to catch it!  We've had this toy for several months, and there isn't a day that goes by he isn't seeking it out so we will play with him. He's an indoor cat, but he is quite the hunter.  He really enjoys the "thrill of the hunt", so it gives him lots of good exercise.<br /><br />My cat loves it so much, I bought one for my son's cat as well.  His cat is just as crazy about it.<br /><br />If you buy one, plan to buy one or two extra feather attachments for it.  (They sell them separately.)  The feathers hold up well, but they do eventually wear out from so much play time.  The only down side I found is the string that attaches the wand to the feather. My kitty eventually chewed through it, so we had to re-knot the string, which makes it a little shorter to play with now.  My cat chews on everything, though so others may not experience this small issue.  Even with the shortened string, this toy continues to give my cat (and me) hours of fun playtime together!

review/summary: Best cat toy ever!
review/text: Ever since I adopted my cat a little over a month ago, I've spent $$$ on cat toys, from feather wands bought at Petsmart/PetCo to fancy "ball in a track" thing from Amazon. I am slowly figuring out what he likes and dislikes, and it seems he has an exclusive interest in feather wands (that I have to operate). I have had over half a dozen of these now, and this is THE BEST. Not only is the cat absolutely CRAZY about it, chasing it up and down and all over the apartment (I stop and put it away when he starts panting), it's very easy on me, the "operator." Other wands tend to be shorter and oftentimes I have to sit on the floor and drag them around, because I have to stoop if I stand up, if I want to drag it around the floor. Needless to say, it's not good for my back, and since my cat is really into stalking and pouncing, I sometimes get bored when he is taking too much time "observing" the feathers before he dashes over. Feline Flyer is different. It's long enough for me to stand up and walk around when I wave it at ease, and the cat loves the workout because he can chase it all over the place when I walk from one end of the room to the other. My cat usually loves to rip feathers out with gusto (and have destroyed a few, within a few days of purchase), as if in revenge for all the chasing he has to do, but with this one, he has almost reverence for it! When he catches it (or when I let him win), he will actually stand a little away, gazing at it, as if waiting for it to fly again.<br /><br />The only warning though, is that the feathers are really stiff, much much stiffer than those on the "feather duster" types. The advantage of that is they are sturdy and probably won't come off easily, but I sometimes worry that it might accidentally poke the kitty's eyes.<br /><br />I wish Amazon Prime sells the attachment replacements...<br /><br />In summary, excellent product!

review/text: My cat LOVES this toy. He jumps up in the air to play with it and pounces on it on the floor. We play with him with it for about 10 minutes and he gets tired and lays down. But when I put the toy away (way up high on top of a cabinet) he gets really mad and sassy and wants to play more. He will sit for long periods of time staring up at the toy wanting to play. We bought the other attachments but the feathers are his favorite.

review/summary: Awesome feather toy, but metal parts may cause tooth damage. Use electrical tape...
review/text: Both my kitten and my 12 yr old male love this toy, I think it's in part because the feathers "spin" when the toy is pulled through the air. It's also awesome that I can just buy replacement feather-toys to attach at the end of the line once this toy breaks. I was a bit worried about them chewing on the metal connectors and damaging their teeth though, so I just taped over the metal parts with electrical tape before letting them play with their new toy.

review/summary: He loves it--and so do I!
review/text: My 10 month old cat loves this thing.  Of course, he loves all toys like this and destroys them rather quickly, but this one actually lasted longer than most.  Plus, I really prefer the length of the rod and the grip on this thing to other similar toys.  Sounds silly, but much of the time I am multi-tasking when we play, and this toy is truly pleasant to maneuver from the human perspective.  If this thing were fulfilled by Amazon and available for free shipping, I don't think I'd ever buy any other toy.

review/text: Great product.  My 1 year old tabby loves this wand and feather combo.  The feather is what he really likes vs, some of the other wands.  The bird feather is realistic and makes real sounds when you whip it around.  The only issue is the durability of the feather itself.  My cat destroyed the first feather in 2 weeks...we're on the replacement feather and its not looking so good (maybe a week left).  Company needs to work on this or I will stop ordering the replacements (at an outrageous shipping cost, not on the prime program).

review/summary: Marinate or inject?
review/text: How bout both!<br /><br />This is one of my favorite marinades for pork and chicken. The orange juice, garlic, and cumin<br />really shine in this Mojo elixir. Bust out the ziplock bags, cover, and marinate overnight. If<br />you want to inject as well go right ahead, just don't overdo it. And BTW, this marinade is very<br />compatible with dry jerk seasoning, don't be shy.<br /><br />One of the best things about this stuff is that its available just about everywhere, and for<br />around $3, thats pretty cheap for what you get in return. If you're not familiar with Goya, they<br />were the first producer/distributor of Spanish products in the US, the company dates back about<br />80 years. Great stuff.

review/summary: Cold Winter Day Soup
review/text: This is one of those soups that is perfect for a cold, winter day.  It is very hearty and filling, and splitting one can between a couple of light-eaters makes it perfect.<br /><br />This is a very creamy soup, very thick.  There are plenty of big and small chunks of potato.  The flavor of garlic really stands out, it is very tasty.  You WILL have some serious garlic breath afterward!  This soup tastes pretty salty, that's my only complaint.  As I worked my way through, the salt got a little more intense than I like.<br /><br />The ingredients are good, no artificial items to make you wonder what you're eating.  The sea salt is better than table salt, though it is still a high sodium food.  There is also quite a bit of fat (including saturated), so it shouldn't be something eaten regularly if you're watching fat intakes.<br /><br />All in all, Creamy Potato with Roasted Garlic is a very tasty and hearty soup that quickly fills you up and gives you a real kick with that garlic.

The soup has a wonderful texture and subtle perfect co-mingling of flavors which just warms the soul. If you really want to be in potato heavan (i've never met a potato i didn't like), try spooning some over a nice baked potato with some fresh chives. Even works well over baked yams with the sweet and savory combo. Please don't stop carrying this, amazon!!

When opened, I was shocked that they would use a box that's twice the size of what is needed, without even the stuffing air bags. Over half of the cans are dented, the ones you would discard while selecting them in a grocery store.<br /><br />I never had a problem ordering anything on Amazon before, whether they're books or grocery. This one is very disappointing. I felt like they went to a grocery store, filled some random box with unwanted, dented, and old canned soups. I will reconsider when ordering something like this next time.

review/summary: My Personal Favorite
review/text: Hands-down my favorite root beer.<br /><br />I found it during a fun weekend with the kids:<br /><br />Our local Raley's grocery store has an end-of-aisle display with several dozen specialty sodas.  Maybe two years ago, prompted by the teenagers, I brought home about 2 dozen different root beers, and we had a 2-day root beer taste-testing competition.  The kids and friends soldiered through, and by the end of the second night, we had universal choices for the top three.<br /><br />Buckin' Rootbeer was the top choice for me, for one of the two boys, and for a few of their cousins as well.  It has a slight but distinctive licorice flavor, and a fantastic aftertaste with just a hint of wintergreen.  The fact that it leaves your palate with real flavors, instead of a chemical aftertaste, immediately buried most of the other competition.<br /><br />Some online reviewers thought that the lack of a good frothy head was a drawback.  Maybe it's just because I'm older and wary of things that are overly carbonated, but--in addition to the outstanding flavor--the fact that Buckin' was also the absolute smoothest of top 2-3 root beers clinched the deal for me.  And they (Jackson Hole Soda Co., on their web site) are right when they say it makes the best root beer floats!  It already has a flavor that's reminiscent of the best root beer candies.  When you add ice cream to the mix, well...if dieting, I cut back on other things before I cut back on this.  It's that good.

review/summary: LOVE the already activated grains!
review/text: I agonized over other reviews of dry kefir grains and the pains of reactivating them when I came across this product already activated.  It worked beautifully!  I'm so glad I went with this one, especially since I'm using expensive goat milk and didn't want to waste it on a few days of activation.  This product started multiplying and making delicious kefir immediately -- the first time took about a day and a half, and since then it takes about 24 hours to make drinkable kefir. Definitely worth the slight extra cost up front!

review/summary: Very Impressive!!!
review/text: Very impressed with this seller. Received my kefir grains in 3 days, took them out of the bag, strained them with some milk, put them in fresh milk and am now making kefir... all in 5 minutes.<br /><br />Perfect! And, much, much better experience overall than the dehydrated grains you have to re-hydrate for 5 to 7 days and change the milk every day and yada, yada, yada... big pain :). In addition, you get a lot more grains this way. My dehydrated grains, after hydrating, are about 1/8 the quantity as I received here.<br /><br />Very impressed with the level of detail in the packing and care of the kefir grains for shipment.<br /><br />I will update this tomorrow once the milk has turned into kefir. Highly recommended. So far so good!!! :)

review/summary: first time making kefir! easy.
review/text: This was the first time I have ever seen kefir grains. It was a cold minus 5C when the mail arrived and I thought that they did not make it. Boy did they survive! The seller sent more than I expected and I followed the enclosed directions and now after about a week of making my kefir, my only complaint would be that I now have too much kefir. It grows fast. I now have over 1/2 cup of huge grains. I am using a plastic dollar store colander with a handle for my strainer. I use glass jars and just put them in a small insulated picnic cooler. Well, just wanted to say that this is fun and easy for this first timer to use. And much cheaper than store bought and I KNOW they are alive and fresh! Thanks! Any tips or suggestions? Also, is it ok to eat excess grains? It looks like there will be more kefir than milk soon. Or should I make more jars?

review/summary: I'm not sure what these grains are producing.  It's not Kefir.
review/text: Sure, you get a lot of grains.  But, they fail to provide a creamy, yogurt product.  The milk curdles and seperates, but then, even after stirring does not produce a thick yogurty texture.  The grains are useless.  Buy from Life Time Kefir instead.  I have a whole bunch of grains from this supplier and nothing more than curdled very sour milk.

review/summary: Good coffee, great price with subscription
review/text: Love, love, love Amazon's subscription service.  This is one item on my list.  It's not great, not spectacular, but I'm far from a coffee snob.  Obviously better than Folger's or other supermarket coffee, arrives at my door free of shipping because of the subscription, and is very reasonably priced.  Make a pot every morning and it really is good to the last drop.  Not great, but good, and certainly good enough for an everyday coffee.<br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br />9/11/11<br /><br />Well, they upped the price considerably on this coffee (like $11 when I started, now $18-something), so I'm going back to Eight O'Clock.  It was okay while it lasted, but I'm certainly not going to pay more for what I consider to be an inferior coffee -- even if I'm not a coffee snob and the merely okay Eight O'Clock is considered a step up on the ladder for me.

But as far as I known, Colombian coffee is not supposed to be very oily. It is on the light side.  Overall, I am satisfied but not super impressed.

review/text: I love my chubby cat. Which is why i wanted to get her to lose weight to ensure a nice long healthy and happy life. So when i went to target and saw these on sale i went for it. Ive fed her this for a year...trying out different portion sizes and playing a lot with my cat. Its been a year now and ive seen no difference..some people say she even got fatter. So i did research and not only did i find out that dry food was horrible for my cat, i was feeding her one of the worst brands! Its like feeding your cat sugary cereal. Not only will this food do nothing for weight except maybe increase it and screw up your cats health ive come to the conclusion that it gives her dandruff as well. When i finally switched to wellness a month ago her coat was nicer and she just looked better...i ran out and had to feed her left over iams in a rush..the next day she was covered in flakes and she only ever had dandruff when eating iams. So basically iams suck and this particular "weight control" sucks even more. If you care about your cats health switch brands and do some research.

review/summary: No weight loss noted.
review/text: I've got a hefty cat.  At 14 lbs, she's definitely on the big-boned side of things.  For about a year and a half we had her on this weight-control stuff, feeding her about a 1/2 cup a day as recommended on the packaging.  But in that time, we hadn't seen any significant weight-loss.<br /><br />About 6 months ago, we switched to the CostCo-brand stuff, and got lazy about measuring out her food and have just refilled her bowl when empty.  Now, I suppose it's possible that the CostCo food doesn't taste very good, and that's why she eats less of it, but it seems to serve the same purpose, and it's not like she complains about it.  After all is said and done, she's still 14 lbs.<br /><br />I don't want to say it doesn't work, because maybe it will for your cat, but it didn't for mine so I wouldn't expect any miracles here.  Still, it did serve its primary function (the cat ate it) despite not living up to its secondary function (the cat is still fat) so, 3 stars.

review/summary: Cheap ingredients that actually make your cat gain weight
review/text: I fed my cat Iams Weight Control for 3 years before she died of stomach cancer.  In that time she only lost weight when the cancer started.  Her coat was dull and rough.<br />That experience led me to research feline nutrition both online and by talking to animal nutritionists.  If you read the ingredient list in Iams Weight Control, you'll see that most of the first few ingredients are corn and other grains.  Cats are carnivores and need a high-protein diet, not a high-carb diet.  The extra carbs are stored as fat.  If you have an overweight cat, steer clear of Iams and go with a high-protein, low-carb, grain free premium food.<br />My two young cats eat a variety of high quality food.  I feed them 3-4 times a day and they are at a perfect weight.  Their coats are shiny and soft.  You can feed your cats a lot better food than this.

review/summary: cat gained 7 pounds after 2 years diet on this food
review/text: I started buying Iams Weight Control and was keep buying it for 2 years. The purpose was to keep cat's weight under control. But he was hungry all the time and demanded more and more food. Even though, I was giving him half less food portion that it was recommended on the package, he was keeping gaining weight. His weight was 12 pounds two years ago, now it is 19 pounds!!! Veterinarian told us that he is obese and should be on the diet to reach at least 15 lb. He should get only 270 kcal per day and no more. Now I am giving my cat Purina Weight Control. Cat's behavior is completely different!!! He is so much happier, and is not demanding food anymore. As a tip, add water to your cat dry food, it helps with prevention of urinary track problems. Also, serving sizes should be smaller than it is recommenced on the packages.<br /><br />Back to the Iams Weight Control, I personally believe that they add some kind of appetite simulating substances into there food, and should be sued for this!

review/text: I have a tabby who was 17 lbs when I started him on this food a few months ago. Now he's down to 14.5 lbs. Basically, don't go by the recommended feeding amount on the package, because your cat won't loose weight. We used this food a while back with the recommended amount, and nothing happened. If you cut it back a little, it works, just be sure your cat is still getting enough to eat. Also, we supplement it with a can of wet food every now and then so the cats can get some real meat.

review/summary: the secret to my faux tandoor* chicken tikka
review/text: While I love the taste of this stuff my figure just can't justify the extra calories unless it's an emergency. Consequently I don't use enough of it to make it practical to try the recipe that's been provided here in the reviews. I'll be content to shell out a couple of bucks on this brand because it is the key for a dish so wonderful I wouldn't change a thing including this particular brand/ingredient:<br /><br />Cube a couple of chicken breasts and saute in the coconut butter until lightly browned* - watch the heat carefully as the coconut butter can burn easily. Add one 14 oz jar of Tiger Tiger brand Peshwari Tikka Masala Simmer Sauce to the pan and simmer over low slow heat for 10 minutes. Add one small chopped onion and stir occasionally for three minutes more. Top with fresh chopped cilantro and serve over Jasmine rice into which some green peas have been strewn in and some Naan on the side.<br /><br />* cooking the chicken in the coconut butter mimics the delicate tenderness that happens when the chicken breasts are cooked in a proper tandoor oven.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: This is honestly my favorite Apple Juice of any brand hands down.  It is just the side of cider but I don't like cider much so I can't say that it is too close but is definitely more "apple-y" than regular old apple juice including their own standard juice from Mott's.  Unfortunately it is a bit pricey but the taste is incomparable.  I bought this on Amazon because the price with Subscribe and Save was fairly inexpensive compared to store prices. I also have difficulty finding this in the stores at all.<br /><br />I also like the 64-oz bottles vs some of the larger bottles out there for juice.  I think it stays fresh that way since there isn't as much to go through once it is opened.<br /><br />Give it a try, you won't regret it.

This stuff is reconstituted from concentrate with pureed skins apparently mixed in, but the result is watery and lacks fresh apple juice richness of taste. You can't tell this from the bottles which are heavily tinted, but poured into a glass it is pale and lacks body, even after vigorous shaking. Not looking forward to going through 8 gallons, wish I had bought just one at the store first.

review/text: I have a 6-light track in my bedroom which I have rarely used due to the heat it produced, plus one or two of the bulbs are always burnt out... they go so fast I couldn't be bothered to replace them. I mainly relied on my CFL desk lamp/under desk LEDs, and christmas lights in my closet...<br /><br />I hung my artwork around my room and really wanted to actually be able to see it, so I coughed up the cash for these. Their white balance was about perfectly on par with the old incandescent bulbs, they come on at about 60% brightness immediately and quickly come to full power. They are the perfect brightness to light a medium-sized bedroom with 6 of them on a track. They generate pretty much no heat, so I can leave them on for extended periods of time without worrying about my bedroom getting uncomfortably warm. I've had them a few months, used them much more than ever before, and have yet to need to replace any of them.<br /><br />the packaging is also superb... I tried ordering other CFLs and they came in a blisterpack-type packaging, and bulbs were broken... these are packed nicely and securely to withstand some shock, then bundled together in a brick... I don't really see how it could have been executed any better. The packaging then easily collapsed for recycling.

review/text: Obviously the product is self explanatory and FIDO says it tastes great.  However, getting the product is another issue altogether.  It is quite clear that the packaging of two 12 pack cases in a single Amazon box is insufficient for the rigorous journey through UPS.  The cans are damaged and some split open with fortunately the shrink wrapping holding dried up mess inside of outer package.  I would be prepared to spend time with customer service if you subscribe for their packaging is horrendous.

review/summary: subscribe/save ripoff
review/text: this is my four dogs favorite canned food-i figured using the subscribe/save was the best way to get it since the UPS guy brings it right to my door-no more heavy cans from the store. i first signed up december 13,2011-got 24 cans for $12.66--today-not even a month later-- i went to send for an extra delivery and the price is now $22.29 -it went from 53 cents a can to 93 cents a can in under a month--i will be going back to the grocery store for this--it is 67 cents a can there--i am not sure why pedigree thinks they can get away with making it seem we are getting a bargain by signing up for subscribe/saving when really they are ripping us off. my subscription is cancelled.-i will go back to lugging  heavy bags at grocery store-
