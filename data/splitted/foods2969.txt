review/summary: Pine nuts
review/text: Don't bother with these if you're planning to eat them raw. They have a very strong aftertaste which can linger in your nose and mouth for over a week, altering the flavor of everything else you eat. Roasting them removes most of the aftertaste, and makes them usable -- even tasty.  Still, i wouldn't recommend these to anyone who has a truly sensitive palate.  Also, if size matters to you, these are small.

review/summary: Tantalizingly Smoky, Delightfully Piquant
review/text: A good friend gave us this wonderful Whole Spice Chili Chipotle Powder for Christmas, 2009 and it's almost gone as I write this in early May, 2010.<br /><br />It's tantalizingly smoky and irresistable in the mysterious quality it lends to certain combinations. Yes, it's delighfully piquant and, if you have a heavy hand, just plain hot.  So, lighten up, use less and enjoy the deep flavor.<br /><br />Try a light sprinkle of this Chipotle and Garlic Garni on sunnyside-up eggs served on toast with a garnish of arugula or watercress.  Hmmmm...makes my mouth water just writing about it!

review/summary: Too spicy "flavor", too fine grind
review/text: The good thing about the Chipotle flavor is generally that the smoked jalapenos are a bit milder and more flavorful than regular (raw) jalapenos.  That is NOT the case with this powder.  This "Chili Chipotle Powder" is HOT HOT HOT, and seriously lacking in flavor.<br /><br />The other thing is that this is an extremely fine grind, so when I sprinkle it into a sauce, enough of it enters the air and I end up inhaling it, and it feels like I'm burning my nose.  YUCK!<br /><br />Stick with a plain old generic "chili powder" instead of this.

review/summary: Barbara's Bakery Cereal and Subscribe-and-Save
review/text: I personally do not eat this cereal (not because I do not like it, but because I am not a big cereal lover), but my husband does.  He loves it!  And I want to thank Amazon for carrying this sometimes hard-to-find product and at a discounted price via subscribe-and-save.  It still is a bit pricey for cereal but Amazon's subscribe and save program has saved us some money, as well as lots of time trying to find this product (especially at a semi-reasonable price) in our local stores.  It must be a good cereal because it is often sold out!<br />So this review is not only for the cereal, but for Amazon's great subscribe-and-save program as well!<br />My husband adds: "Please keep offering this cereal!"  That speaks volumes.

review/text: I know they don't claim to be "soy-free," however, it seems completely unnecessary for them to buy corn that has SOY in it...for the price of this cereal, and the healthy image Barbara's is trying to project (especially with their new packaging push), they should take the extra step to ensure that the product is SOY FREE.  Cater to your many, many food allergy customers instead of going the cheap route and buying contaminated corn.<br />(From Barbara's website: INGREDIENTS: ORGANIC WHOLE OAT FLOUR, ORGANIC CORN FLOUR, ORGANIC OAT BRAN, ORGANIC FRUIT JUICE CONCENTRATE (APPLE, PINEAPPLE, PEAR, OR PEACH), SEA SALT, BAKING SODA. CONTAINS SOY (IN CORN).<br /><br />MANUFACTURED IN A FACILITY THAT ALSO PROCESSES MILK, HAZELNUTS, ALMONDS, COCONUT, AND WHEAT. *AMOUNT IN CEREAL.)<br />I am saddened that Barbara's supports and enables the disgusting farm subsidies that allow soy, a top 8 allergen in the US, to contaminate our food supply.

review/summary: Light and Relaxing Tea
review/text: I love this tea. Granted, I am a very unsophisticated and uncouth tea drinker, but I still get an opinion, right?<br /><br />Pom & Petals has a subtle, gentle, floral taste to it, with a tiny hint of berry. I first tried it in a sample stacker tin and then had to order the full size, because I absolutely love it. When I take a sip it makes me think of shades of pink and Victorian gardens. It's one of those rare teas that works for me nearly any time of day - it's optimistic enough for the morning and afternoon, and relaxing enough for the evening. I love that it's caffeine free, as well as organic. And it comes in a cute reusable tin.<br /><br />But really, I love it for its flavor. It's romantic and subtle and flowery and fragrant. I'll definitely order it again.

review/text: I've got a huge sweet tooth and the fillings to prove it. I bought these in hope they were similar to peach rings. They are not. They are very soft, and not chewy like peach rings. While they are covered in sugar like peach rings they seem to be far messier. Sugar just falls off as u eat these. That brings be to my last complaint. With all that sugar these aren't that sweet.<br /><br />I didn't hate them, but I far from love them. I and my friends usually go nuts for candy but it took a while to finish these. I would like to add that it could simply be a matter of preference as I do love Haribo Gummi Bears, and I think Haribo makes quality candy.

review/summary: Move over peach rings!!
review/text: Peach rings used to be my favorite candy, that is, until I met the delicious Haribo gummy peaches!  They actually taste quite a bit different than the peachy-o rings.  These have a much finer grain of sugar on them, which I prefer.  They aren't sticky/don't stick together.  Sometimes in the ring version I would pull one out, only to discover 2 or 3 more stuck to it.  The gummy part is also different.  It's not as chewy as the ring version - and by chewy I mean kind of rubbery.  The flavor is also a lot better in the Haribo peach candy.  It's more sweet peach tasting and less sugary tasting.  I first fell in love with these at my local Target store.  For some reason they were kept on an end cap in the toy department, and only during winter time. I was lucky to stumble upon them!  And so I made my yearly peachy purchases and spent the rest of the year reminiscing about how good they were.<br /><br />Fast forward to one day when I was looking on Amazon for a gift for my nephew.  I knew he loved peaches, so that's what I did a search for.  A long shot, but I was kinda hoping Amazon sold a peach pie or something. LOL!  Holy smokes, was I happy when I saw that you can buy Haribo gummy peaches ONLINE!  And not only that, but in a 5 lb bag!  I sent him a bag, and do I even need to admit that I bought one for myself?<br /><br />My nephew loved the candy.  He took a sandwich baggie full every day to school to share with his friends at lunch time, until they were gone.<br /><br />My own personal stash - 5 lbs is a lot of candy!  These lasted for a few weeks, among a family of 5.  I also gave a hefty size bag to my Dad.  They never got stale, each piece tasting as good as the first one out of the bag.<br /><br />If you love gummy candies or peach, you will not be disappointed in these!

review/summary: Delicious candy, but do not order it in the summer because it will melt!
review/text: I ordered the Haribo Peaches because they are a delicious variety of candy.<br /><br />However, I ordered from Amazon in the middle of August. And it was 100� out. Big Mistake.<br /><br />They arrived all melted, as you can see from the picture I uploaded way up there at the top.<br /><br />DO NOT ORDER HARIBO PEACHES IN THE SUMMER! You can probably get away with ordering the Haribo Happy Cola in the summer though, because I ordered those too and they didn't arrive melted.<br /><br />I thought maybe that once they cooled down I could cut up the melted part and eat it. However, it was still way too sticky. If you have some Haribo Peaches and you tear one apart or bite into it, you can see that the candy part inside of the sugar coating is extremely sticky. Everything melted together and was really sticky like that. Not good.<br /><br />I'm rating 5 stars because I have eaten them before, unmelted and they are great even though mine were all melted.

The insides are so soft it's almost like you're eating a real peach, and the outside has just the right amount of crisp sugar coating. And there are a buttload of them. But beware, it's nearly impossible to stop eating them, even when you begin to feel sick.

They don't turn hard and stale immediately after you get them like other gummies which is fantastic and they have a luscious peachy flavour that will leave you craving more and more (they outta put a warning on these things!). What also makes them wonderful is the texture to these fabulous treats. They are sugary and firm-ish on the outside and incredibly velvety and juicy on the inside. It's absolutely divine. Ahhh . . .

review/summary: really nice treat
review/text: I order these and split the bag with a friend or else I would be four axe handles wide. I have no self-control when it comes to candy, these are a perfect pick-me-up. They are not hard like fruit jels, really soft and the dusting of sugar is a nice touch. Haribo is slightly off the beaten path when it comes to candies, unique and tasty!

review/summary: beware
review/text: I've bought these from Amazon whenever they've had them in stock, love the 5lb bag, because it's more economical.  On a whim, I decided I'd weigh the last bag...4lbs 8oz, even with all the loose sugar in the bag.  Maybe 4oz isn't a lot to some people, but 4oz is a single bag purchased alone for $1.69... makes me wonder if all the past purchases I've made have been underweight as well.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: Now that I have developed a taste for peach gummies, and after experimentation, found the freshest, softest, most tasty example of this product apparently sold everywhere, I am disappointed with Amazon's version of the same product.  The gummies arrived safely on time.  No problem.  Everything was the same until I bit into the first one.  It looked the same, smelled the same, even tasted the same, but the texture was not soft, nor did it taste fresh.  It seemed like this product had been on the shelves for months.  I've had some that were harder, obviously old.  But these gummies were unsavory simply because they were not fresh.<br /><br />I hesitate to want any more by the subscription method.  I had chosen the seller that sent the best product, obviously Amazon did not choose MY choice.  Please cancel this subscription.  I want to receive my gummies from the vendor I know has a fresh product.  Thank  you.

review/summary: try them first before ordering 5 pounds
review/text: Firstly, these are my favorite candy. I'm literally addicted.. Hence the buying of 5 pounds of them. But if you've never tried these, i highly recommend trying them in a store if you can find them. I can find them at my local Walmart or Reasors in little haribo bags of about 10. It's a candy you generally either love or hate, so buying 5 ibs of them when you don't know if you like them is not a very good idea...

review/summary: The Best Peach Gummies?
review/text: Absolutely the best Peach Gummies.  I am constantly buying the peach rings at the store for 50 cents apiece and thought they were awesome, I was wrong because these are.  If you close your eyes and smell inside the bag you would swear a freshly cut peach was under your nose.  Put them in a Ziploc bag and they will stay fresh for a long while too.  At a little over $3 a pound this is a steal, I recommend highly.

I don't know what it is, but I think it's that these remind me of when my mom used to cut up fresh peaches and sprinkle some sugar on them when I was a kid. I've already gone through TWO bags of these things over the last couple of months...that's just shameful! Even more shameful is that I just signed up for the "subscribe and save" option lol. I cannot believe how good these are...

I find their flavor to be stronger than most, which is good, but I also can't plow through pounds of them at a time like I can some other brands.  Still, the flavor is excellent, and the quantity here is even more fantastic.  Just be sure to seal them up nice and tight or they might go bad before you finish.

review/text: I guess my taste-buds just aren't like those of most.  I don't find this confection worthy of the high ratings others give.<br /><br />It's an okay confection.  Not horrible, not sublime, average.<br /><br />These circles are about the size of a $0.25 piece, have a yellow/peach alternating color scheme, and are covered with granulated sugar.  There's so much sugar that there are piles of it at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />The texture is much softer than a traditional "gummi" product, and much softer than Hairbo's other "gummi" products.  After you open the bag, the confection starts to lose its softness quickly, so be prepared to eat the entire bag upon opening.  As a last resort, some sort of container that can be closed to the outside air, like a zip-lock bag, could be employed.  After eating about 2 lbs I started to feel full, and in a hyper-glycemic episode, broke down and put the remaining 3 lbs in a zip-lock bag.<br /><br />This confection is also very sweet.  If you are one that likes their "sweets" only partially so, this will probably be too sweet.<br /><br />If you're looking for an inexpensive, peach-flavored, very sweet treat, these are a good choice.  Just don't expect a life-changing, 5-star confection.

review/text: This has got to be the best gummy candy by Haribo. I really recommend trying this favor first. It smells like peaches and the gummy were all so soft unlike some of the other flavors. I have tried pink grapefruit and raspberries which were not that great in my opinion. The pink grapefruit were a lot harder than the peaches, but they tasted like grapefruit. However, after eating one there would usually be a bitter after tasted, which was disgusting. Meanwhile, the raspberries by Haribo was in fact very distinctive, in that the outer coating were cover with hard sugar while the inside was soft and sweet. The raspberries came in two color, red and black. The red actually taste like raspberries and they were good, but the black ones were awful. I could not identify what flavors they were, but one thing for sure is that they really sucks.

If I had wanted only celestial I would have ordered the celestial assortment. This package is not recommended unless you primarily want the celestial teas.

review/text: Good taste and good price at a buck a pack, but you really need to brown some ground beef and onion to punch it up. I've only had Stroganoff with BEEF and/or mushrooms as a 1-dish meal. I think this is great for the base of a 1-dish meal but I don't care for it by itself. I commend Lipton/Knorr's for this "less sodium" version.

review/text: After switching to a gluten free diet I was discouraged by the taste of all the breads and crackers I tried. This was the first one I tasted that I was like, Wow, that doesn't taste gluten-free at all! The word "lentil" threw me, but it's really the best cracker out there, gluten free or no. The pepper and salt varieties are good, too, but this one is the best. Add a little whipped cream cheese and it's the perfect snack.

review/summary: Best GF cracker around
review/text: These are the best gluten-free cracker I've ever had.  Since GF crackers are usually disgusting, that might not be saying much, but these can stand up against non-GF crackers.  Their crispness is similar to wheat-thins without the sweetness.  My only critique is that I wish they had a non-salted variety as I think they would be just fine with less or no salt.  But the salt is easy to pick off as it is.  The rosemary flavor could use a little more rosemary, but they are nice, neutral crackers to pair with a dip or cheese.  Even with these criticisms, I still gave 5 stars.  I'm so excited I found them.

review/summary: No. Flavor.
review/text: I did a wheat-free trial diet for 30 days, and one of the snacks I had on hand were these lentil crackers from the Mediterranean Baked brand.  Plain Sea Salt Lentil Crackers.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Crispy crackers don't leave you feeling heavy after snacking.<br />- Different dips or toppings can be paired with it.<br />- Great list of ingredients<br />- Gluten-free<br />- 5g protein in a serving.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Rather bland and tasteless.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />I found the crackers to be pretty bland.  They're not overly salty, which is nice, but I guess lentils just don't carry enough flavor on their own.  These crackers are good if you have a dip or topping for them, as their bland flavor makes a great base for just about any dip flavor.<br /><br />These are an okay snack for those on a gluten-free diet.  If you don't need to live gluten-free, find another cracker, for your tastebuds' sake.

review/summary: Tasty little crackers
review/text: I just started eating gluten free and gave these a try.  I haven't tried many GF crackers, but the ones I have tried all tended to taste like crunchy rice crisps, blah!  These were not the case and taste like real crackers!  They are made from Lentil flour which gives these crackers a nice boost of protein. Unlike many other GF products, these aren't loaded with starches, so they are healthier for you.  The rosemary flavoring is great.  The expiration date on thees were 9-10 months out, so they arrived fresh with plenty of time to enjoy.

review/summary: Pleasant vanilla sugar substitute
review/text: I do my best to reduce both sugar and aspartame in my diet so I like this little dropper of vanilla-flavored stevia as a flavoring for hot items such as hot tea, hot cereal. etc. I do find if you use more than a few drops it can be bitter, but I find the same for stevia powder. Really, it is sweet enough that a tiny amount is all you need, especially with its vanilla content. I also sometimes use it to hide bad tastes in liquid medications and other unpleasant things - the combo of the vanilla & stevia can hide quite a bit. But mostly, I use it instead of butter & sugar in hot oatmeal & other cereals, which saves a lot of calories.

review/summary: Not super sweet but will do.
review/text: I purchased these a while back when I was trying to find a healthier alternative to artificial sweeteners. They are OK. Not super sweet. However, I realized that my taste buds had become corrupted by all the fake stuff and that I had become accustomed to the super sweet taste of nutrasweet, sucralose, stevia (blends) etc... So much so, that even SUGAR didn't taste sweet enough anymore. Just LIke Sugar is an appropriate name for this product. It is about as sweet as sugar. Now that I've been using it for a while I find it perfect in my coffee, tea, yogurt, or any beverage that needs that little bit of sweetener. Try it, but don't expect it to be super sweet. You may find you need to use two packets to sweeten your beverage.

review/summary: Disappointing!!!
review/text: I have been looking for a good sweetner for a long, long time. Sugar is out, and after reading about all the research on the artificial substitutes, I was almost physically sick. Those little blue, pink and yellow packets we've been pouring into our drinks are highly toxic!!! It boils down to the fact that these products are made from wood alcohol. In other words, formaldehyde!<br />It causes a myriad of health problems, and could be a pre-cursor to alzheimers, according to medical lab researchers. Many people experience loss of memory, slow, fuzzy thinking, or fogginess. There are so many other troubling symptoms that I cannot even list them all.<br />This is why I tried "Just Like Sugar". I put one packet in my tea and couldn't tell any difference. I put 2 more in, and still couldn't tell it was sweet at all. I had the feeling I was going to stand there all day and pour it in and still nothing would change. I am stuck with 3 boxes now, but never fear I DID find something better called "TRUVIA". I found it at the grocery store and am very happy with it. It has the natural sweetner Stevia in it and is healthy for you. I have tried other sweetners with Stevia and was disappointed, but this one works! One packet is all you need. Forget Just Like Sugar. Try Truvia and stop searching! Don't wait another day!

review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!
