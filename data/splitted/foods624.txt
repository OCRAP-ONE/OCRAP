review/summary: Kind Bars are the Best!
review/text: This box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio & Antioxidants is delicious as is all the Kind Bar products.  They are a great choice for a balanced, satisfying, nutritious bar very low in sodium and without gluten.  LOVE KIND bars.  I will definitely be back for more.  The 12 Pack boxes from Amazon are a GREAT VALUE too!

review/text: This is by far the best purchase I can imagine to have made.<br />I bought these KIND bars and keep them in my office drawer.<br />They are yummy, nutritious and filling.<br />I find it to be the best choice instead of running down to the cafe for a Bagel or some other form of breakfast.<br />Also a very good option when you are totally deprived of energy and saturated.<br />It is not too sweet. Just the right flavor and amazing if you like dates and almonds (I love them).<br />Sometimes I feel I could eat many but then it fills you up just right to not crave for too many.<br />I love this particular flavor and also the cranberry one they have.<br />It seems like a total value for money item and they also were prompt at shipping it.

review/text: I'm excited to try the other KIND bars. I am looking for a low carb and more natural snack bars and I think KIND is a very good choice for that. The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is pretty good, although I haven't found a great number of cashews. I've had it in rather hot places and it does kind of lose its shape. That's annoying. Purchasing it through amazon.com was a breeze, I enjoyed having 12 at once and saving. This stuff is okay to buy in bulk because you can consume it so quickly.

review/text: At 190 calories, these bars provide a great calorie boost with very healthy ingredients.  Cranberries and almonds have loads of healthy benefits and naturally combining them into a convenient bar is definitely a one of a KIND product.  I am very satisfied with the taste and they are my friends' favorite choice when grabbing a snack to go from the pantry.  They have a short ingredient list compared to similar bars.  Purchasing through subscribe and save makes the amazon price the lowest I could find and very reasonable per bar.

review/text: I like this bar.  It does have an initial interesting taste, but I'm sure it's the mac nuts in it.  I would buy it again.  It is VERY moist and sticky - which is good cause it won't dry out your mouth like a lot of bars do.  I think I'd like to try other flavors as well.  I let a co-worker try it and she said, "it tastes like lip gloss".  I'm not sure how she got that opinion, but thought I'd put that in my review.  It is different from any other bar that I've eaten; sesame seeds, mac nuts, etc.

review/text: I dont really worry about my weight these days.  These bars are not exactly low calorie, though, in the writeup I read on the internet I , the guy who created the product says he sometimes eats a couple  of them for lunch. That's about right, it would be a tasty light on-the-go lunch at 420 calories. So much better for you than a candy bar. I read an interview the magazine about the founder of the company, and it inspired me to try other bars also, where they are selling them everywhere . I loved it. The one I sampled was different from this one, but this one sounded like I would enjoy it even more, and I did.

Contain all natural ingredients, which will give you instant energy for that tennis game or other favorite sport. Not recommended as trail bars, because heat will melt the dark chocolate in the bar.

The only thing is I wished they had a little less sugar. The nutritional facts say they have 14g of sugar. Now 14 grams of sugar is not bad if you are comparing it to a candy bar but for a nutritional bar I would ideally like 10g of sugar or less.

review/summary: I've finally found "my" bar
review/text: I've been some combination of nursing and/or pregnant for a few years now, and trying to find time for a meal when chasing after a toddler or when morning sickness gives you many reasons to avoid every food on earth can be a real challenge. Because of this I sometimes feel like my pantry is some sort of test cabinet for a nutritional bar company. There are always at least a few kinds in there, ones that I've tried before and like and ones that I'm trying out for the first time. I finally got around to trying Kind Bars after all this time, and this specific flavor is officially on my "that's it, you've found a gold medal winner" list.<br /><br />There's usually something for my picky side to take issue with, but not this time. I love that they have extra protein, as they really manage to leave me feeling full and satisfied if I end up turning to one in place of lunch. The fact that it was packed with nuts made me suspect that I would find it too crunchy, but it has the perfect level of chewiness with a really pleasing-but-not-overpowering crunch. Unlike their sister bars (Passion Fruit Macadamia + B Complex, which I purchased at the same time) these are not cloyingly sweet. Don't get me wrong, they have sweetness, but I find that it's just the right amount-- you're tasting the nuts and other good things with just a bump of sweetness to help it along.<br /><br />I bought one box to try them out, now I'm back to load up on them while they are on sale. I'm going to be keeping these as my main bar with one or two other favorites for occasional variety. If you are the kind of person that is always on the lookout for a quick meal or snack fix, I really can't recommend this specific bar more!

review/summary: Deceptive labeling for glorified peanut bars
review/text: I agree with Catriona about these bars tasting like a peanut bar and nothing like the advertised description. It seems like the company is trying to pull a fast one here by promoting these bars as almond, walnut and macadamia, especially when peanuts are listed as the first ingredient in tiny print in the ingredients list. Maybe they think that people can't tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts?<br /><br />I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK, but I have a hard time believing that the 4.5 star rating the product currently receives hasn't been created by company shills.<br /><br />It is a shame too, since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description. If I had only ordered these I likely would never have purchased another product from KIND PLUS.

However, the chocolate is changed in texture and I have to eat these bars while leaning over the sink or a plate to catch chocolate schnitzels that fly around!<br />DON'T ORDER THESE IN SUMMERTIME!!!!

review/summary: No sulphur dioxide!
review/text: These bars are soooooo good.  My daughter has asthma which can be triggered by sulphur dioxide and these bars don't use this chemical to preserve the dried fruit. The bars are not hard or crunchy but they are not chewy either.  Texture is kinda like a snickers bar.  Easy on the teeth.  Everyone in my family has loved these bars.  I thought the price was a little high but now that I've tasted them, they are completely worth it.  I used to buy Clif organic Z bars which weigh 36g and these are little bigger at 40g and much better tasting and more nutritious.<br /><br />Update:  I've downgraded my rating because I just bought the peanut butter dark chocolate + protein and it contains soy protein isolates which are difficult to digest and can cause GI distress.  I heard one of the owners of the company on a podcast (Romy Nelson) talking about the cons of this very protein and why they did not use it about a year ago.  What gives!

review/text: These are delicious, especially if you like cranberries and almonds. The cranberries are not too tart or sour, so they provide a nice sweetness to the bar. The whole almonds while delicious make it a little harder to chew, so if you've got fragile teeth buyer beware. I switched to these for a while from the macadamia and mango ones, which are also great, and I noticed a bigger energy boost from these, the cranberry ones. A great product. Bit pricey though, at $1.50 a bar.

review/summary: yummy!!!
review/text: I love the mango macadamia nut flavor. It's sweet with a little crunch, plus vitamin D and calcium. And great also since it's gluten and dairy free. The only reason I give 4 out of 5 stars is that I cannot eat most flavors since I cannot eat almonds. I'm hoping someday there will be more almond-free flavors.

review/summary: My KIND of bar
review/text: If you love nuts and want something truly natural, even satisfying to the sweet tooth with quite a numerous amount of nutrients, this is it.  It's been an excellent on the go between meals snack for me.  Also, compared to my local store, the price per bar is better buying this 12 pack.

review/text: Delicious bar! I love it.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  I love the crunchy pomegranates in it.  I reach for these bars ever morning for breakfast or a quick snack.  One thing I love about KIND bars is even if they have crisp rice, it's not the majority of the bar like some other bars out there.  The bar is mostly nuts and fruits as advertised.  Overall, just a great and healthy snack to keep on hand.

review/summary: These taste great
review/text: I read an interview in Inc magazine about the founder of the company, and it inspired me to try a bar at Starbucks, where they are selling them at the cash register these days. I loved it. The one I sampled was different from this product, but this one sounded like I would enjoy it even more, and I did.<br /><br />These bars are not particularly low calorie, though, in the article I mention above, the founder says he sometimes eats two of them for lunch.  That's about right, it would be a tasty light on-the-go lunch at 420 calories.  So much better for you than a candy bar.

They are really really good! I figured they'd make a good breakfast bar but I've found myself eating them for dessert instead of chocolate - they're that good.

review/text: Being allergic to all other tree nuts as well as peanuts, this snack bar with macadamia nuts and mango is fantastic.  The macadamia gives it a nice crunchy texture without being too hard.  The mango makes it a little sticky, but the bar can be easily pushed out from the wrapping and eaten a bite at a time without getting your fingers sticky. I really love the taste of this bar.

review/text: These are fantastic.  I recently started looking for more health conscious snacks to eat during the day at work and came across these.  After reading lots of other reviews on amazon and reading the ingredients which have zero unrefined sugar I decided to try these delicious bars.  And they didn't disappoint, they are moist, mildly sweet, nutty, and still healthy.  I've tried the cranberry almond which are also tasty but not as amazing as these.  I plan on ripping through the rest of the flavors over the next few months as they go on sale.

I wouldn't reorder and will probably try to coerce the grandkids into eating this box.

review/text: I am a person that if my food smells off, I probably won't eat it. When I opened the wrapper, I got this funny whiff of odd sugary something... I know that is not the best explanation, but it was hard to pin down. Everything was stuck to the wrapper so maybe it gives off an odor when heated. Just a guess. In regards to the natural ingredients, I appreciated that they made sure to use as few fillers as possible. I would try another flavor anytime.

review/text: These bars taste fine but there is a problem with the condition of the product sent. The back of the bars are stuck (perhaps melted?) to the plastic wrapper and can only be removed by scraping off small, individual pieces. I ordered these Cranberry Almond bars along with the Kind Apricot Almond and Mango Macadamia Nut bars.  The other flavors came from a different seller and arrived in great condition, even though they were sent in the same shipment as the defective box.  I won't bother with the hassle of attempting to return them, especially since I ate one of the bars before I realized there was a problem with the entire box.  A real waste of money.

Mangoes, Macadamia nuts and coconut in 1 bar?  Heaven!  I turned on several of my co-workers to these and plus they have folate and calcuim, which were not in the bars prior.  I fell in love with this bar first and eventually, it became popular because at one point, the Starbucks I used to frequent could not keep this flavor in stock!!!<br /><br />My kids do not like the flavors I ordered but there are some that I am sure that will sway them over!<br /><br />Thank you amazon for bringing these in at such great prices!!!

review/summary: Probably the best nutritional bar I've had thus far
review/text: KIND bar is little like fine dinning, they don't give you a huge portion, and its quite expensive compared to others, but the portion they give you is so good. This is one of the few health bar that doesn't give you that sugar high and then nap time afterward.<br /><br />As a working individual that logs a lot of hours behind a monitor, sometime it is difficult to grab a meal when you are in the middle of something. So for the past few years, I've been stashing a collection of nutritional bar at my desk. Usually, that stash consist of items on sale from either Amazon or Vons. I've many different bars, from Clif Bar, Nature Valley's Granola Bar, to Balance Bar. None of them can compare to KIND bar. I've actually never heard about this company until a sale on Amazon, but due to great reviews. Which is why I want to put in my 2 cents as well.

Following a gluten-free and low-allergy controlled diet, I stumbled across these KIND bars while looking for nutritious options for my teens, thinking I would be able to try them. Well indeed they truly are scrumptuous. My 18 year old loves them and when running out the door will grab one or two for the road. I have only tried the Walnut and Date and the Cranbery, Almonds and Oxidants varieties as I follow a blood type diet and also do not love foods that are too sweet. We are on our second box of each and I will be looking at the other varieties to try in time.

review/summary: Almond cashew + omega 3 Snack Bar
review/text: This is a nice snack.  It looks fairly healthy.  It's tasty and filling, especially with a cup of tea.  It is pretty chewy and loaded with nuts.  The almonds are on the hard side, in case you have trouble chewing.  The bar is mostly nuts with some cranberries and something that tastes like a date paste holding it all together.  It tastes a little on the sweet side but not too bad.  The wrapper claims 50 % each of vitamins B3, B6, B12 - 500 mg Omega 3, all natural, gluten free, wheat free, 4 g fiber, non GMO (sorry, don't know what that means), no trans fats, 150 calories per bar/80 from fat.  Total fat 9g, o sodium, o cholesterol, 190 mg potassium, 16 g carbs (I think--wrapper hard to read), 14g sugar, 4 g protein<br /><br />If you are looking for a decent snack for you or your children's lunch box, here ya go.

review/summary: Packed With Nutrition
review/text: These nutrition-packed bars are delicious and I highly recommend them for an energy boost.  One slight drawback is that in the heat/summer, they tend to become quite soft and mushy and can be a mess to open and eat, especially if you are carrying one with you.

review/summary: Hard to believe it's good for you
review/text: I was looking for a replacement for my morning biscotti, something a bit more nutritious.  After searching on Amazon and reading reviews of breakfast snacks,<br />I decided to try these bars.  I'd had a KIND bar once and sort of remembered it was good. Well, these are FANTASTIC!  At first bite, I realized there were chunks of sweet mango, the intense mango flavor hit my palate, and it tasted real, not at all artificial.  This was followed by a bit of cruncy coconut which just perfectly tempered the sweet mango.  The macadamia's added a stronger crunch with just a hint of honey.  So I tried the ultimate test:  I gave one to my co-worker (out of the package, a blind test). This person lives on junk food and considers Krispy Kreme one of the four major health groups!  She absolutely loved this bar and sat down and ordered some on her break!!  The ones from Amazon were received in two days, expiration date was Dec 2010 (ordered April). They are fresh and the price was great with subscribe and save.  Love that I am getting some extra calcium and vitamin D (and no, you can't taste whatever they put in to add that).  I'll be ordering these regularly through subscribe and save. I just have to make sure I don't eat them for snacks, just for breakfast, or I'll run out =)

review/text: As someone who has been trying to add more Omega 3 nutrients to my diet; I have found this bar to be a healthy and enjoyable way to do so. I keep one in my bag to eat as a snack on a daily basis. The bar is not overly sweet.  The cashews and nuts are very fresh.  The fruit is moist but can be a little sticky when chewing.

review/text: I ordered Kind bars after paying ridiculously high prices in retail stores. The Mango/Mac is delicious and it was fresh, soft & yummy. I was a bit worried after reading other reviews on Kind bars that they were old, stale or near their expiration dates - not true the box I ordered was wonderful.

review/text: I LOVE Kind bars, but these are terrible.  Upon taking one bite they tasted stale and not like any other Kind bar product I purchase on a regular basis. I litterally had to spit it out after taking a bite...and that's extreme..sorry!!  Steer clear of these new bars, I really think something was wrong with them, again I couldn't return due to Amazon's policy.  Very disappointing.

review/text: These appear to be pretty healthy online and after the taste test and review of the ingredients I was pretty satisfied. They could hold off on some of the sugar/glucose, maybe unsweetened cranberries. Don't get me wrong, they are pretty tasty and mostly healthy but just a bit too sweet. A little tweaking and it could be the best "healthy" snack I've eaten.

review/text: I'm a HUGE fan of Kind bars in general and have tried several varieties. I chose the almond cashew with flax + Omega-3 this time because it was more price friendly than the others. I should have known that you get what you pay for. This was the most unsatisfying Kind bar I've ever had. It's dry and lacks taste. Now I'm stuck with a whole box.

review/text: I ordered this item, hoping that the combination of nuts would be good, but I was sadly disappointed with the taste.  Its like they tried to use as little sweetener as possible, leaving a dry, dull, bland taste and its like I could have just bought a bag of mixed nuts for cheaper than what I paid for this box of bars.<br /><br />Would not buy again.

review/text: We love these bars...they make a great snack for my preschool daughter who has multiple food allergies.  No soy, hooray!  I have been buying them for about a year and a half.<br />This box we got from NetRush, though, tastes "off" and "old"...perhaps they were not properly stored.  I will not buy from this seller again, although Cranberry KIND bars will remain a staple in our pantry!

review/text: I bought the Cranberry Almond and the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio. I'm not sure how anyone can comment on the flavor - it's sooooo sweet. The non GMO glucose + the sugar + the honey masks any flavor this bar might have. It's my fault. I should have read more closely. Not sure I understand how this is a "Low glycemic" food. Definitely not a KIND option if you're trying to reduce your overall sugar consumption.

review/summary: A great snack
review/text: These taste really good!<br /><br />The primary nut is almond, although there is a background of peanuts, and occasionally cashew. The sweet element is  made up of dried cranberries and a generous amount of dried cherries, held together by an undertone of honey and lashings of delicious dark chocolate to bind everything together. Delicious.<br /><br />A haiku adds class and authority to any review,or, to put it differently, what can seventeen syllables tell us about this product?<br /><br />Berries and cherries<br />Almonds peanuts cashews too<br />Choco honey yum.
