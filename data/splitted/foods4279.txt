review/summary: Weird, tongue tingling aftertaste
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze is convenient product to use, especially for those of us that don't enjoy the taste of plain water. 2 squeezes into a standard size disposable water bottle and you're good to go.<br /><br />I appreciated the extra vitamins and electrolytes Vitamin Squeeze added to my water. The energy part of it, with 40g of caffeine, sort of went unnoticed for me. I never felt the extra energy kick in, but my tolerance for caffeine may be higher than most.<br /><br />The fruit punch taste was pleasant and made the water much easier for me to drink. Unfortunately, it had a weird sort of aftertaste. It made my tongue tingle, much like it would had I ingested certain types of poison. Obviously, it's not poisonous, but that tingle definitely detracted from the enjoyment I had while drinking it.

review/summary: Energy, Sucralose and Fake Cherry Flavors
review/text: I'm all for energy drinks and occasionally will need that extra push to get through the late afternoon. Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, is not a horrible product overall. I have felt more energetic for about the last week (which is the time period I've been using it) and that's probably due to the vitamins. There's not really that much caffeine in this, so the effect overall is mild.<br /><br />However, that said, the two things that bother me about this product are the flavor and the use of Sucralose.<br /><br />The flavor is reminiscent of Vicks Cherry cough syrup, IMO. Not exactly refreshing and very artificial-tasting. What cherries and punch would taste like if they were made of out plastic.<br /><br />The use of Sucralose is a little disturbing for something that purports to be healthy. Why not use stevia, an all-natural sweetener instead? Zero calories and very sweet, but not man-made and you don't get these fun side affects(from Wikipedia): "A Duke University study found evidence that doses of Splenda of between 100 and 1000 mg/kg, containing sucralose at 1.1 to 11 mg/kg (compare to the FDA Acceptable Daily Intake of 5 mg/kg), reduced the amount of good bacteria in the intestines of rats by up to 50%, increased the pH level in the intestines, contributed to increases in body weight, and affected the levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)"  OK, I'm not a rat, but still, that is kind of a negative in my book.<br /><br />So, energy: 5 stars<br /><br />Flavor: Minus -.5 stars<br />Sucralose ingredient: -.5 stars

review/summary: Great taste, and great value
review/text: At these prices this has to be a 5 star rating.<br />Not so of course, if it didn't taste good, but I found it pleasant, not too sweet, and no saccharin or sweetener aftertaste, unlike some of the other liquid additives I have tried.<br />Like others, you choose the measure for how strong or weak you like it.<br />Growing up in Europe we all drank "squash" - no, that's not the vegetable, but fruit concentrates like orange, lemon, apple and blackberry, that were cheap, and diluted with water for kids to drink. If you want to try one of the best out there I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UETCWO">Robinson's Orange Barley Water, 28.7-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> by the way.<br />This is basically the same thing, if you like stronger flavor to your bottled or filtered water add more concentrate, simple really.<br />Comparing 12oz bottles to 1.62oz bottles of the most well known competitor is a no brainer, and whereas you may not be able to carry this easily in your pocket or back pack, or through airport security, you can always decant some into a smaller container.<br />5 stars for value for money, and probably 4.5 for taste

review/summary: Great mio alternative
review/text: I've been a loyal Mio customer since I first spotted it months ago. I love the ease of amazing flavored water drinks. Although I loved the convenience, the small size and high price was always a little bothersome.<br />Enter Vitamin Squeeze!  The bottle is huge.  It will last many times longer than a small bottle of Mio.<br />The flavor is lovely. It really tastes fruity-not like a kids fake fruit flavored drink. I like that theres plentyof vitamin C. Not crazy about the "natural caffeine" but I can overlook that.  Hopefully other favors will come caffeine free.<br />One thing to point out-the bottle is much easier to squeeze than Mio.  The first glass ended up making a mess and too much came out.  User error and easily corrected.<br />If you like Mio or even crystal light mixes, give this a try. I was very impressed and will definitely be buying more.

review/summary: Not the Most Attractive Taste
review/text: The package was pretty easy to open but the content squirted out a bit and stained my shirt.  The flavor isn't that great.  I really disliked it the first time and didn't finish the drink.  I've tried Mio and that took a bit to get used to but I liked having some water with a little flavoring so I kept using it.  I tried Vitamin Squeeze again and finished the glass.  It was better but again, when I took the bottle out of the cupboard, I happened to squeeze it lightly and some squirted on the counter and floor.  The lid was still on.  I used a weaker amount where I didn't taste the Vitamin Squeeze as much and enjoyed the water.  I don't think I'll purchase this product on my own.  The stains on my shirt did come out and the counter and floor clean up was fine.

review/summary: Decent Vitamin-Enhancing Fruit Punch
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer Energy-C Fruit Punch is a vitamin-enriched drink that will interest anyone with a most active, vigorous sports-oriented lifestyle. It is fortified with various vitamins such as C and the B series, and electrolytes, with zero calories, sugar and carbohydrates.  I found its taste to be too sweet that I opted to dilute it in half with freshly squeezed orange juice; the punch's taste was still quite sweet even after I had diluted it. Others, however, may feel differently about the drink's taste. Without a doubt, it is a worthy addition to energy boosting drinks of which Gatorade may be the best known - and best loved - example.  For the active sports enthusiast, this is a drink that should be considered as a potential substitute for Gatorade.

review/summary: Poor design
review/text: As far as flavor goes--kind of like cherry Kool-Aid, this product is okay, if that's what you're looking for. And I guess it has added vitamins and no calories, so it can make plain old water taste a lot sweeter as you're working out, giving you a bit of an energy and nutrient boost over the simpler water. My beef, and low star rating, is for the poor design of the bottle (at least the one I got as a sample). That thing was a hot mess. It didn't just squirt out a single stream where you want it; no that red dye stuff went ALL OVER the place in my kitchen, nearly staining my counters and cabinets. So I can't recommend this product because of the mess factor.

review/summary: Decent Kick, Flavor Not So Good
review/text: I've dabbled with supplements for a while; this one tastes similar to the fruit punch flavor usually found in them, which for me isn't that great a taste. The caffeine boost with the vitamin content was appreciated though, and I like the concept: a quick squeeze in a cup of water in the morning to get you going. All in all, another flavor would be better for me, perhaps the grape pomegranate.

review/summary: Not a big fan...flavor for kids, but too much caffeine
review/text: I like water additives as an alternative to sodas or sugary drinks, so I was excited about trying this one.  I thought it would be one that my 9-year old son and I could both use. The mix has a sweet fruit punch flavor if you follow the recommended dilution, but getting that squeeze just right is sometimes tricky. Although it seemed like a good idea to have a large bottle that you could adjust flavor levels and for a reasonably good cost.  It is just harder to execute in actuality than in design.  My son would squeeze to much and we went through a cycle of add a little more water then a little more mix...<br /><br />My biggest complaint and the reason I wouldn't use this product regularly is for the caffeine content. I generally use water additives as an alternative to sodas or other beverages and thus look for caffeine-free alternatives.<br /><br />OK, but I won't be a repeat user.

review/text: The flavor is more like red Popsicles than Hawaiian punch, but still really yummy! There is a bit of an after taste that I don't care for. The bottle is pretty large - you get a lot more with this than you do with one of those little things of Mio which is nice for monetary reasons but also convenience reasons. I didn't really notice a boost in energy, but I usually don't with these things. My one bad note is that I wouldn't have this shipped to you unless you're going to use the speed shipping. When I got mine, because of the lengthy journey in the heat - I opened it and there was a mini explosion, the red in it stains the skin for awhile. I would just drive down to the store and buy it.

review/summary: Surprisingly Tasty!
review/text: I drink a LOT of water.  Water probably constitutes 95% of my liquid intake on any given day.  When these "water enhancers" hit the market, they seemed over-priced and questionable.  But when this one came around, I took Amazon up on their offer and gave it a try.<br /><br />To be frank, it's not bad!  As others have mentioned, the caffeine level is questionable, but I think that's alright.  Mixing caffeine, vitamins, and water seems like a futile effort because of caffeine's diuretic characteristics.<br /><br />Flavor: It tastes somewhere between Fruit Punch Kool-Aid and Hawaiian Punch.  The one-star deduction comes into play here because there's definitely a twinge of artificial sweetener -- a taste I cannot stand.  It's so minor, though, that I still enjoyed the drink.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Easily gives water some taste.  Drink enough water and you yearn for anything to mix it up.  Simple as a squeeze!<br />-Pretty tasty and not overly-sweet.<br />-Good source of vitamins.<br />-The bottle is actually pretty big, so it should last a while.<br />-Good flavor<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Artificial sweetener taste to it (as well as aftertaste)<br />-Needs to be used within 30 days after its opened.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />-Pretty tasty and a nice change from just plain, old water.  Plus, it offers up some actual benefits (unlike kool-aid and other stuff).

review/summary: 40 mg "Natural Caffeine" per serving, faster delivery mechanism than coffee or tea

The serving size is<br /><br />I had to visit the website that is listed on the bottle to find out how much caffeine is in it: 40 mg per serving.<br /><br />I am a regular coffee drinker and this caffeine feels more like taking no-doze or 5 hour energy or red bull, probably the Taurine.  The red color also stains your skin, and the bottle leaks once you open it.<br /><br />If it weren't for the weird rush, I would give this 4 stars, due to the dribbling bottle, and the staining.<br /><br />That said, if you can manage red bull, and/or five hour energy, then you can probably handle this and it does definitely leak, don't put it stand it up like in the picture, at least not once you open it.

review/summary: Good, Can Be Messy, Perfect Caffeine Level
review/text: I always have enjoyed the powdered water enhancers. I have no trouble meeting my daily water intake goals (minus milk and V8, water is all I drink), but I like to get the added Vitamins products like Crystal Light provide, particularly when I am working out. The problem with those powdered mixes is that many of them do not mix well on the fly. Some of the Crystal Light variations do (the immunity enhancing kind does) while others that I like (the protein and fiber one) do not. When they don't and all you have is a water bottle to shake at your disposal, the clumping action at the bottom is a bit irritating as much of the powder stays there despite vigorous shakes.<br /><br />All of this is why I think the Vitamin Squeeze is really handy. The fact that you could take this and pre-squirt it into a water bottle as you head out for a walk or off to work is quite handy. I used to take Crystal Light to work with me and then pour it in my water bottle and have a real hassle mixing it without bringing along my long-handled spoon from home. With this product you could leave it in a work fridge and never have to think twice about it. Very handy.<br /><br />I also like the Vitamin mix it provides and don't mind the little bit of caffeine. According to the caffeine chart on my Bigelow teas...the 40 mg per serving is about the equivalent of a cup of green tea (which contains far less caffeine than coffee).<br /><br />The only other thing I can say about it is that my husband must have let a little bit pool around the hinge on the lid last night and that some of it ended up on our linoleum counter top. I scrubbed it to my usual level with dishwater and there is still a bit of the coloring left on the counter. I'll have to get after it with some Comet or a similar product to actually remove the little ring...so be warned, it will leave a mark if not wiped clean prior to use.

review/summary: Pretty good idea....3 stars.....
review/text: With all the new drinks and ideas on the market this is a good idea since it contains vitamins and is easily<br />stored and can add to bottled water for something different with some taste. Now, when I opened my sample<br />that I received I had a great deal of difficulty pulling open the tab under the cap. I tried the drink<br />on several occasions by adding it to bottled water and it's not bad. However, it is not a great taste either.<br />It's a fruit punch taste but a bit strong though that can be adjusted by just adding a little less into the<br />bottled water.<br /><br />I'll give it a rating of 3 out of 5 stars. It's convenient and has some apparent health benefits, but with<br />all the drinks, flavored drinks, etc...on the market I am not sure that I would seek this out to buy this<br />particular product very often.

As a healthy substitute for other drinks and even juices (due to their high calories) I will recommend this Vitamin Squeeze.

review/summary: And, too, I'm a little confused
review/text: We have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KYT6CS">Sodastream Fountain Jet Soda Maker Starter Kit</a>, so I'm always on the lookout for healthy ways to flavor carbonated water as well as regular water. This Vitamin Squeeze energy drink is a good idea, but there are several problems I have with it. First, we need something without the caffeine. Being older and with a heart patient and a seizure-prone individual in the family, we are trying to cut way down on caffeine. Anyone with kids (the group the Fruit Punch flavor seems to be targeted to) is also not going to want the caffeine. The large bottle is a good thing until you realize you should use it up within 30 days. You'd need active, thirsty kids with friends or a large family to consume it all within the use-by date.<br /><br />The vitamins are what we are after and a healthier alternative to sodas. Specifically, we want a go-to drink that helps us wean ourselves off of diet sodas and get in the habit of reaching for water instead. (Those with soda-addicted children are probably looking for the same thing.) That's a tastebud issue as well as one of habit, just like cutting salt out of one's diet is&mdash;you start with more and then lessen the amount you use as your taste buds adjust. But the sucralose sweetener, as it is with many of these flavored-water drinks, is dreadful at any strength, IMO.<br /><br />I know, too, that the idea that sucralose is bad for you is controversial, but the taste of it is not. It has an indisputable chemical taste that I am not fond of. Why not Stevia instead? Or xylitol (with a caution about overconsumption causing diarrhea). The product has to be refrigerated, so why not something other than the shelf-stable sucralose?<br /><br />Finally, I'm confused about the "one squeeze" claim. I got the impression that this "one squeeze" is a measured amount. However, when I did one squeeze in a glass, it did not stop squeezing before I did and I wound up with a glass that was too strongly flavored and yucky. Is this how most people like their drinks? There seems to be some kind of control mechanism in the open portion of the cap, and also it looks like there is some kind of straw thing being used in the picture on the bottle. Is a straw thing required to measure/control the squeezer? My bottle (just one, for review) did not come with anything like that. So all I can say about it is that the squeeze does not seem to be measured. Maybe I misunderstood that it was going to be.

review/summary: Punch (Water Enhancer) w/ Poor Taste
review/text: Ok, I admit it. At first I just thought this was an energy drink and not a water enhancer. Drank some straight up thought it tasted nasty. Then took a peek at the reviews and realized you're supposed to only give a squirt to 8 oz. of water. Did that and it tasted less strong but still not pleasant. I like fruit punch as a flavor, but the taste of this leaves a lot to be desired. The flavor of Hawaiian Punch is hugely better than this. Tried giving another squirt, and it still tasted weak and unappealing. I see it's got some Vitamin C and B vitamins as well as caffeine in it. And, as has been mentioned by others, this container is not easy to open. I recently injured my right arm, and that certainly didn't help any. You have to slice into the top a bit, and then screw off the cap to find a seal that is quite hard to peel off. Like breaking into Fort Knox! Despite the flavor issues, this might offer some kick and vitamins, but who's going to drink it, if it doesn't taste good? Almost brings Gatorade to mind, which I always found awful.<br /><br />Sorry, this just did not work for me.

review/summary: I like it, but is it a better substitute than...
review/text: Coffee?  Sports Drinks?  Energy drinks?  The reason I ask is that it seems to be a amalgam of all the aforementioned.  You get your caffeine, taurine(and heavy dose of vitamin B), as well as electrolytes in just one squeeze.  But now to put it against the gauntlet and grade it accordingly:<br /><br />-Coffee:  I know I'm not the only person who feels that this is an irreplaceable morning staple.  Although if you only drink coffee for the morning jolt of caffeine than this could be a fine substitute.  For me it's the taste and having something warm to start the day(particularly during our extended east coast winters). D+(God forbid I'm out of coffee some morning and running late, this could pinch hit for a morning I suppose.)<br />-Sports Drinks:  Again, an absolute must.  I play allot of sports so my trunk is filled with these at any given time. A(Refreshing with a good flavor, also less syrupy than many sport drinks.)<br />-Energy Drinks:  I don't do them.  Personally I feel like the ramifications of jamming several of these down your throat daily(as many of my friends and co-workers do) has yet to truly reveal itself... I very well could just be paranoid though. C(I'm fairly ignorant when it comes to these but I think the carbonation is part of the allure that many energy drinks hold, you won't find that here.  This is a zero carb alternative that some may enjoy.)<br /><br />That's not a horrible set of grades(and very common for any report card I've ever received), although I think the obvious application for this is if you lead a active life(i.e. sports, jogging, hiking) and want to spice up your water bottle.  It should be noted that the price may seem high but that each of 4 bottles you receive has 24 servings.

review/summary: Caffeine-laden "energy" drink
review/text: VITAMIN SQUEEZE ENERGY DRINK is designed to be squirted into bottled water to turn your everyday thirst quencher into a tasty fruit punch chock full of vitamin C.  The bottle claims that one serving satisfies 130% of your daily requirement for vitamin C, which is great.  The problem is, the "energy" you're likely to feel after chugging a bottle of VITAMIN SQUEEZE-flavored water comes from the "natural caffeine," rather than from any vitamins.<br /><br />I'm not sure what "natural caffeine" is (it seems like an oxymoron to me!), but it's not something most health-conscious people are looking for in their vitamin drinks.  That was enough to turn me off to the product.  Add to that the intense amount of red food coloring (a tiny bit of the stuff dripped on my hand and I had three very red fingers) and you have another reason to pass on it.  As others have said, the bottle does tend to leak, which means this bright red substance is very likely to end up on your hands, clothing, or carpet.<br /><br />That said, it does taste like fruit punch, and I do like the concept behind the product -- you can adjust the amount of flavor, which makes it very convenient (unfortunately, the label states that the product should be refrigerated after opening, which means you can't just throw it into your gym bag or keep it in your locker or desk drawer).  But a carb-free, fat-free, calorie-free health drink should not be full of caffeine.

My wife and I decided we didn't like the taste very much and although our oldest daughter liked it a lot, my 45 year old palate found it underwhelming.<br /><br />For those who remember what it is, it tasted very much like Hawaiian Punch.<br /><br />It's sweetened with sucralose (aka Splenda) which is much better than aspertame (aka Nutrasweet) in terms of taste and potential side effects.

review/summary: like koolaid with caffeine, drink tea instead
review/text: An overly sweet energy-concentrate that produces a mix tasting much like kool-aid.<br /><br />I expected this fruit-flavored energy drink touting its nutritional qualities would taste a bit like fruit and have natural ingredients, but unfortunately the cough-syrup-red result is colored with Red #40 (made from coal, rather than a natural alternative like beet juice), and the cloying sweetness is courtesy of Sucralose (found in Splenda sweetener)-- a little sugar wouldn't have hurt, and stevia extract would have been perfect (naturally sweet and also zero-calorie).<br /><br />The unfortunate flavor would have appealed to me as a child, but I've long outgrown Hi-C, Kool-Aid, and the other fake-fruit-sweet drinks.  Maybe this does appeal to American taste-buds, since I noticed a lot of reviewers said they liked the flavor-- taste is highly subjective.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze would certainly be a healthier alternative to diet colas, the minimal packaging and water-basing are environmentally sensitive, and the portable format ("just add water") has some appeal.  But if portability isn't imporrtant, try brewing flavored green tea instead, or drinking bottled products like Honest Tea that have minimal calories, better taste, and none of the fake ingredients.  Not Recommended.

review/summary: I prefer Mio.
review/text: First off, let me say that when you see the bottle and realize that per serving is 1/2 ounce, you think this will last a long time.  However, for any real flavor (at least in my opinion) it took 2 significant squeezes to handle a standard water bottle.  With Mio I was able to get by with 2 squeezes, but the amount used was less.  When you squeeze on this bottle, it seems like a lot comes out.<br /><br />As far as the energy goes, I wasn't buzzed and flying around, but it did seem to help me through the afternoons where I tend to drag the most.<br /><br />The taste left something to be desired.  Even after 2 full squeezes, the flavor seemed very faint to me and not very fruity at all.<br /><br />All in all, just an average product, I like Mio more, but really wonder if this stuff is necessary in any fashion and that it may be better to just stick with my vitamins.

review/summary: Satisfying boost with good taste
review/text: In truth, I'm not a big fan of these squeeze bottle water flavorings. Often, I find it hard to control the quantity, and under-flavoring makes the drink taste like a flat soda, whereas over flavoring is just too sweet. This larger bottle, however, seems to give just the right amount of flavor if you use two fingers to squeeze until it becomes too hard to squeeze anymore, and the spout seals tight and effectively to prevent drips and spills. The overall flavor is your typical fruit punch-y flavor, and there is only that faintest hint of chemicals to suggest the caffeine, taurine and vitamins it contains. The pick-up it provides is mild, I'd say about the same as a cup of coffee or can of diet soda. I don't think the other stuff in it is particularly strong or useful to my body as far as recovery times, strength building, electrolyte supply, etc. Still, I use this as my flavoring of choice on rest and light workout days, with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X5FYJQ">Optimum Nutrition Essential Amino Energy, Fruit Fusion, 30-Count</a> my "go to" drink on workout and hard running days. This is a decent water flavoring that is easier to use than most, providing a little variety with no sacrifice to my fitness regimen.

review/summary: Really sweet
review/text: This Vitamin Squeeze, while touting vitamins that you need in an easy way to get them, is nothing more than a Splenda-laden artificially flavored water enhancer. I followed the directions and added two squirts to my 16 oz water bottle (one squirt for every 8 oz of water) and first of all, you need to empty some water from the bottle before you add this product or you'll overflow onto the counter and second, two squirts were too many. I feel one would have been sufficient. This is really sweet and tastes completely artificial and bad for you, which it is. If you're concerned about your health and feel the need for extra vitamins then I suggest getting a natural supplement from a trusted source. This isn't going to do you any good, in fact just the fact that it is full of Splenda and red dye is enough to make me run from this product.

review/summary: Cough Syrup Tasting
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer is a water flavoring system like Mio or other competitors. It has no calories, no carbs, and no sugar. How does it compare?<br /><br />First, the container. This is a fairly large container, a bit larger than a can of soda, for 24 servings. Other packages like the Mio are able to provide the same flavoring amount in a much smaller, purse-sized container. This Vitamin Squeeze also has to be refrigerated and used within 30 days. So that also makes it less of an easy to use product.<br /><br />It is true that it has no calories, no carbs, no fat, no sodium, no protein, and no sugar. It also provides 120% of your vitamin C, as well as 40% of your vitamin B6, B5, B3, and B12. So you are getting some vitamins here.<br /><br />Ingredient wise, you get water, citric acid, vitamin C, natural flavor, sucralose, natural caffeine, and then a pile of chemicals.<br /><br />But really, it all comes down to taste. My boyfriend and I have tested MANY water flavorings over the years, and this was just not good. It tasted like medicine. We experimented with different amounts, different techniques, and it simply was never as good as the many other options on the market. Even let's say we wanted to have Vitamin C in our diet. We'd gladly eat a chewy, tasty orange vitamin rather than have to drink this. There's really no up side to using this as an alternative.<br /><br />If there were no other water flavors at all available, and this was the only choice, then I might think about trying to get used to this flavor. But why would I, when there are delicious options out there? Not only are there options that taste far better, but they're far easier to use and don't require refrigeration.<br /><br />Of course, I will caveat that we all have different taste buds. Undoubtedly there will be some people who, for whatever reason, adore this flavor. That's fine. For them, this might be a good fit. After all there are people who adore the taste of cough syrup! So maybe that's a good way to judge. If you adore cough syrup and would drink it all the time, then this is probably to your liking. If not, then you probably want to try one of the many other options out there.<br /><br />I was provided a free sample to review by the maker.

review/summary: Not What it Appears to Be
review/text: "Rah-rah for this dose of sunshine, bursting with its delicious thirst-quenching combination of tropical fruit punches."  .. or maybe not.<br /><br />Nutritious?  The implied claim is that it contains "combination of tropical fruit punches." There are no actual juices in the product.  It chemically flavored, artificially sweetened water. I do not consider myself a health food snob, but to call this nutritious is a stretch.  There are a few vitamins, but C is the only that is included at 100% of the RDA.  The others are less than 50%.  If it's vitamin you want, a multivitamin tablet would serve you much better.  The label touts that is provides "electrolytes" but the fine print says 0mg of sodium and that it is "not a significant source" of potassium. These are one of the two key electrolytes you want a drink to provide.<br /><br />Delicious? Whether this is delicious is probably a matter of opinion.  To me it tasted exactly like cherry Kool-Aid.  If you like that taste, and I don't, you might like this.<br /><br />Energy?  It contains 40mg of "natural" caffeine.  I've never heard of unnatural caffeine, so this is clearly an overstatement, to try to convince you of some health benefits.  Will 40 mg of caffeine give you an energy boost?  A standard cup of coffee can have 100 - 200mg of caffeine.  At Starbucks Grande has 300mg.  If a couple of sips of coffee give you an energy boost than this will too.  I did not feel any.<br /><br />Other Issues?  The bottle is double sealed.  An external wrapper seal, and an internally one that you have to pull off.  However, once opened, the bottle leaks, even with the cap on tight.  At least mine did.  What make it worse is this come out like bright red paint. I got some on my desk at work (plastic modular furniture, not wood) and it left a stain that I cannot get out.  I suspect that if you get this on clothing, it will be permanent.<br /><br />Overall I see nothing to recommend about this product.  I am also disappointed that the seem to be making claims that I feel are not backed up by the contents of this product.

review/text: I was already familiar with the MIO water enhancers - this appears to be more of the same except with more of an emphasis on the supplemental vitamins and minerals. It takes a few times to figure out the amount that needs to be squeezed in order to achieve the optimum taste. Having figured that out to MY taste by trial and error, I am enjoying this product and it certainly seems to give me a boost of energy for my workout. I have tended to drink it beforehand rather than during. The taste is pleasant and not at all chemically. It's worth checking out.

No reason to be shy, or a worrry  about running out.<br /><br />The fruit punch flavor is great for morning use, and will give you a "lift" , you can control the "lift"  depending upon how many squirts you might prefer.<br /><br />It is also nice when nused with home soda makers ( or club soda...) and is sensational when added to an ice cube tray, and used in a blended fashion with product and water.<br /><br />I will be trying other flavors soon.  This is yummy, and it works!  One of the best new products I have tried this year.

review/summary: About average, could be a lot better.
review/text: There's suddenly been a lot of these different squeeze bottle drink mix's for bottled water pop up on the market. Some are good, some not so good. The main point that these started with was being a mix concentrate in a "SMALL" squeeze bottle that is "easy to carry with you" and use anyplace anywhere. They decided not to make this one as concentrated so it needs to be a much larger bottle. And even though it is a large bottle of mix, it still only holds enough for 24 servings. The same as the little bottle that MIO uses. It says on the bottle to use one squirt for every 8oz. of water. But it's really hard to tell when to stop squeezing the thing. I think what ever it is in the bottle that measures how much to release at one time in my bottle is broken. It's really hard to tell just how much to use and it doesn't seem to really have much true Fruit Punch "flavor" to it. It sure doesn't taste like any fruit punch I've ever had. It reminds me a lot of the old artificially sweetened Kool-Aid that they came out with a long time ago and used Saccharin in. It has that same Saccharin after taste that kinda sticks in the back of the throat along with a little bit of that vitamin taste.<br />  This is one that I doubt very much that I will be buying any of it in the future. There's just to many others that have a lot better flavor and in a far smaller bottle that's easier to use and take with you. I really hate to say it, but this one just isn't up there where it can compete with what's already on the market and available. Some people might like it, but for me its that Saccharin sweet, almost gagging after taste that just stay's in the back of my throat and wont go away that I don't like the most.

review/summary: A decent sugar substitute
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is a highly concentrated additive that can be mixed with water to create a sweet drink that gives you a does of vitamins as well.  The fruit punch flavor is pretty tasty and a much healthier alternative to the sports drinks and powdered sugar mixtures that are my usual.  The bottle is very handy indeed and is perfect for adding just the amount of flavor you desire.  The plastic bottle yields to pressure in small increments, allowing great control over how many squeezes os Vitamin Squeeze come out.  I find 1-2 squeezes for every cup of water is plenty. Has having a glass or two of VS-infused water (and occasionally lemonade, which is a DELICIOUS mixture) improved my health or energy?  Can't really say, but I've gotten a lot of mileage out of the small bottle I received so I'd have to say that it is worth it for somebody who primarily drinks water rather than the unhealthy sucrose-laden concoctions to try this product for the sake of having some variety of flavor and the bonus supplemental vitamin content.  But if you are happy with guzzling Pepsi, Red Bull, and Kool-Aid, then this is probably going to be a bit pricey for you.  My verdict on Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink: recommended for anybody on a health kick, but not so much if you are looking for an energy boost or something sugary to chug.

review/summary: A Nice Water Enhancer
review/text: Water is nice and much healthier than the alternative but sometimes it is nice to have an extra kick to the plain water.  Vitamin Squeeze is different than other water additives because of, well, the vitamins.  It boasts Vitamins C, B3, B5, B6, and B12, Caffeine, something called Taurine and of course what drink these days would not complete with Electrolytes, whatever those are.  And it does seem to be working because I have notice I have not have as many of those mid-afternoon sluggish feeling since adding it to my lunch water and there is no crash associated from drinking.  It took me a little over a month of near daily use the whole bottle which is good because the packaging says for the best quality to use within thirty days after opening.<br /><br />With the vitamin Squeeze in the water, it kind of taste like the Gatoraide Fruit Punch.  But the biggest problem with the product is getting the right amount of additive into the water.  Not get enough in and the drink tastes watered down (naturally) and put too much in and it taste almost like medicine.  But unlike other water enhancers on the market which just sits in the bottom that you have to stir up, I never needed to stir the Vitamin Squeeze.  If you are looking for a little extra with your water, this is worth a try.

review/text: Since I force myself to drink about a gallon of water a day, I'm always looking for ways to add flavor to my water just to change things up.<br /><br />I really liked this Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink as it added just enough flavor, but also provided some vitamins. I really like that it's all natural, has zero calories, and zero carbs. There's also zero sugar added. It's a very light fruit punch flavor, which I really like since it's not overpowering and sugary like Kool-Aid. You only need one squeeze for a glass of water and the bottle design does make it pretty easy to be mess-free.<br /><br />Once opened, you have to keep it in the fridge, but it's so easy to keep this on your door and grab it every time you have a glass of water. I also use Emergen-C, but like this as an alternative because it's more of a light flavor.<br /><br />I can't wait to try some of the other flavors.

review/summary: Vitamin Squeeze Tastes Great When Added to Tonic Water and Ice!
review/text: Update on June 23, 2012:  I just discovered that Vitamin Squeeze tastes great when added to tonic water and ice.  (See the photograph that I have posted on this website.)  It reminds me of the fruit punch one drinks at a reception for a wedding, graduation, anniversary or other special event.  Tonic water costs about the same as bottled water.  Buy the generic brand.  Tonic water is carbonated water that is usually sweetened with fructose corn syrup, the same sweetener that is used in fruit drinks.  Vitamin Squeeze and tonic water is still healthier than sodas.  The brand of tonic water that I buy has 90 calories per serving.<br /><br />*******************************<br /><br />I suffer from chronic sinusitis; therefore, I shouldn't drink carbonated sodas because they increase my sinus congestion.  Another good reason why I shouldn't drink them is because I am prone to cavities.  However, I get tired of drinking only water.  Fortunately, my dentist recommended that I drink flavored water.  Normally, I use the MIO Liquid Water Enhancers.  My favorite flavor is the MIO Sweet Tea [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4HUMY">MIO Sweet Tea, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>].  It tastes like real ice tea whereas the other flavors remind me too much of the artificial, sugary-sweet Kool-Aid products I drank as a child [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ50U4">Kool-aid Tropical Punch Soft Drink Mix, 82.5-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 2)</a>].<br /><br />  I was excited to receive the Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer from the Amazon Vine Program.  I'm been using it faithfully for over a month.  First of all, it reminds me very much of the MIO products.  However, whereas the MIO products are more travel-size, the Vitamin Squeeze is more suitable for home use.  Vitamin Squeeze's larger 12 ounce size is more economical than MIO's 1.62 ounces.  I work at a shipyard where the water tastes foul.  I usually bring my own drinking water into the office.  I purchase various sizes of Deer Park water as shown in the photograph I've posted on this website.  Before I leave home for work, I squirt three drops of the Vitamin Squeeze into the 500 ml bottle or five drops into the 750 ml one.  The fruit punch flavor is a pleasant respite; however, when my bottle of Vitamin Squeeze is empty, I plan on buying the peach green tea flavor [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQP4">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Peach Green Tea, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>].<br /><br />  Unlike soft drinks, a serving of Vitamin Squeeze has 120% RDA of Vitamin C.  (A serving size equals one squeeze per eight ounces of water.)  Vitamin C is a natural antibiotic that boosts your immune system and helps ward off flus and colds and fight infections, such as a sinus infection.  Each serving also has 40 mg of caffeine which is about equal to that of a soft drink.  However, instant coffee has 65 to 100 mg of caffeine per eight ounce serving; brewed coffee has 80 to 135 mg; and Starbucks Grande Coffee (16 oz) has a hefty 330 mg.  The Vitamin Squeeze has Vitamins B6, B5, B3 and B12 (40% RDA of each), which give you energy.  Honestly, I haven't noticed any difference in my energy levels since drinking this product.  If you want to increase your energy level, the best thing you can do is get more sleep at night.  There are also zinc and chromium (10% RDA), which also boost your immune system.  Like Gatorade, the Vitamin Squeeze also contains electrolytes which aid in recuperation after exercising, especially jogging.<br /><br />  I store my Vitamin Squeeze in my refrigerator in order to maintain freshness.  The first couple of weeks I noticed red stains on the bottom of the refrigerator shelf.  However, using a soapy sponge, I was able to easily wipe them away.  The bottle is comfortable to grip while quickly squirting drops into the Deer Park containers.  I cap the bottles and shake them and the water enhancer is easily dispersed throughout the water.  There is not a horrible aftertaste.  I am reminded of the Kool-Aid I drunk as a child.  Nevertheless, the Vitamin Squeeze is a healthier, more economical alternative to soft drinks.  It is good to use in large bottles of water that you plan to take to work, church or the gym.  Bottled water always comes in handy when I'm walking through my apartment complex or rehearsing in choir.  (I've also sipped on water that was enhanced with Vitamin Squeeze while I relaxed in a bubble bath.)  It is wise to keep a bottle of Vitamin Squeeze at home and at work.  For traveling to restaurants, church, social gatherings, etc., then I recommend the smaller MIO products; they fit easier inside one's purse or backpack.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos

review/summary: Vitamins, flavor and caffeine. What more could you want?
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)<br /><br />If you've ever tried a Mio you get the idea of what this product is. It is a liquid that you squeeze into a water bottle to flavor up the water and add some benefits. In this case you get some Vitamin C and a whole bunch more vitamins and caffeine. That last one is a deal breaker for a lot of people. Why they included it is a choice they made. If you want the extra jolt, you can have it; if not maybe the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4ADKU">MIO Fruit Punch, 1.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> product is better.<br /><br />As far as taste, it's OK. The idea of a "squeeze" as a measure is not an easy thing to replicate. First you need room in the bottle you're squeezing into. It the bottle has too much water, better sip a bit off the top. It seems this product needs more liquid added then the Mio to get a similar strength. Then again the bottle is about four times as large as the signature Mio bottle. Not very portable, it's more for home use. It also needs refrigeration after opening. I added what I thought was a good squeeze and wound up with a dark pink colored drink. It tasted OK, sort of like a red Popsicle. I wanted more so after drink it down a bit I added more to get a more red, red. This tasted better to me, more fruit punchy.<br /><br />Over all I liked it but thought the Mio was a better choice for portability and concentration. It's still a good choice to have around the house for a quick boost of vitamins and flavor. Also, a bit of caffeine if you so desire.

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: I drink a lot of Mio's fruit punch, and I thought I'd give this a try, combining the calorie free flavoring along with much needed vitamin C.<br /><br />It disappointed.<br /><br />The flavor is somewhat fruity, but not particularly close to the usual "fruit punch" flavor.  The taste of the added vitamins is more pronounced than anything but sweet.  It leaves an unpleasant aftertaste in your mouth too.<br /><br />I use water flavoring to encourage more consumption of water, but this bombed out.  It doesn't help that it requires refrigeration either--I like to take the flavoring with me to add to water wherever I am, whether bottled water or tap water. The container is as large as a baby bottle, and it takes a larger quantity of this flavoring to do the trick than that of Mio.<br /><br />I'll stick to Mio for its refrigerator-free portability, small containers, and higher concentration of flavor.

review/summary: I will stay with Mio.  Strong artificial taste
review/text: I have tried many different types of water flavoring products, I was looking forward to trying another option.  My current favorite is Mio but is a little pricey if you do not get it on sale.<br /><br />The idea of adding flavor and maintaining 0 calories is also a bonus.  In order to get the flavor to my liking it takes multiple squeezes otherwise it tastes like a badly watered down kool-aid.<br /><br />The aftertaste of the flavoring is what I do not care for.  I realize the product artificial but it does not have to taste so artificial. If this was the only option on the market it is good enough to overcome this taste but with so many options I would not recommend this to friends and family.

review/summary: Water Enhancement ~ No Yucky after taste.
review/text: I thought the concept of this was awesome; anything to perk up my water.  The packaging it not as ideal for portability as MIO, but it has a way better flavor with much less of that yucky aftertaste. It is available in four flavors - (1) Acai, Grape, Pomegranate (2) Fruit Punch (3) Tropical Citrus and (4) Peach Green Tea.  Just a few squirts and I would have favor-enhanced water on the go.<br /><br />I received the Fruit Punch flavor to sample.  The flavor was consistent - 4 squirts in a 16oz bottle water was my typically usage and at this rate it will last a long...long time.

Again though you have to use the right amount because it had a chemically taste if you over did it by even just a little too much. It also will stain easily but if you are drinking any red beverage that should be expected. All in this was pretty good.

review/text: At least Vitamin Squeeze has added nutrition.  My first impression was that there was a slight tang to the fruit punch flavor, and there is a subtle aftertaste.  However the aftertaste is not overpowering.  I tried it in 12 ounces of cold water and it took two squeezes to make it sweet enough for me.  I noticed some other reviewers were saying they're allowing their kids to drink this.  It's clearly written on the label that it's not for kids due to the high caffeine content.

review/summary: Tastes good, zero calories, nice kick of energy.
review/text: The popularity of liquid concentrates, to add to water or seltzer, has been a god-send. It allows you to decide how intense a flavor to enjoy and puts that control in the consumer -- a wonderful thing when most beverages are cloyingly sweet or artificial tasting. It also has zero calories, which can make it a great asset for dieting or cutting down.<br /><br />The Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink comes in an easy flip-top container; meant to be refrigerated after opening. It tastes fairly good, and has a good vitamin matrix: Vitamin C, B Complex, some caffeine, and a few other goodies.<br /><br />Now, the container itself instructs consumers to not use it in mixed drinks or in conjunction with alcohol but -- lettuce be cereal -- the stuff is made to be added to club soda and vodka. The kick of caffeine, though minor, is a great enhancer to a regular cocktail, and the flavor lends itself (though with zero calories!) to imbibement.

review/summary: Dreadful stuff
review/text: We've used Mio and Crystal Light varieties of water enhancers and were excited to try something new.  Unfortunately, you must use a lot of this enhancer in order to adequately flavor your drink and even then it tastes an awful lot like bad Gatorade.  The fruit punch flavor is not very appealing and the resulting deep red beverage is so thick with food coloring that you can't see through it.  Stain city waiting to happen.  Maybe we're spoiled by Mio since a little of it goes such a long way your water still resembles water after you've flavored it.  You get a much bigger bottle with the Vitamin Squeeze but that's because you have to use so much of it.  It's just not very pleasant to drink.  We couldn't finish the bottle.

review/summary: Good Product but not for Me
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy drink tastes like a child's version of artificial fruit punch. It does provide more flavor to plain water but still not entirely sure that I'd choose it over lemon mixed with water. The directions say one squeeze per 8 ounces of water but depending on the pressure applied, you will get more or less with each application. Too little tastes bad and squeezing longer or with more pressure may go over the recommended dosage. Warning: this does effect the color of your urine.<br /><br />Also the purity of where these vitamins are obtained are questionable. We all know that  obtaining vitamins and minerals from whole food sources are the best, preferably unprocessed & raw/organic. Overall, I don't think I'd purchase this product because I did not notice more energy and it does interfere with my recommended daily vitamin intake, I could be over dosing!

I did let the kids try a sip & my 5 year old thought it was "good & sweet (this was with very little added)" but didn't want any more.  It has to be refrigerated once opened and is much larger than it's competitor Mio (about 4 times larger).  That said, I'm not a huge fruit punch fan so if you are this may be what you are looking for.

review/text: I would have given this product 5 stars except for 2 problems: the description wasn't clear about which vitamins are in it, and there's no easy way to know if you've mixed the right amount of product in your water.<br /><br />The taste is pretty good for a vitamin drink. Yes, it has a slight vitamin taste but maybe I'm adding too much? The punch flavor isn't too sweet or overpowering. I really feel an energy boost when I drink this, so I'm sold on it. I also like that the bottle doesn't drip AT ALL when I use it, and it stands up flat on its flip top cap.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only vitamins in it are C and several B's. Wish it had more or that I had known what was in it when I ordered it. Also, the directions say 1 "squeeze" per 8 oz water. How big of a squeeze? I have big strong hands. Are my squeezes delivering too much or too little vitamins to equal the ingredient statement? The bottle has little hashmarks on the outside wrapper that I assume measre a one ounce serving, but the bottle is totally opaic  - so ummmm how can you see what you use? If it wasn't a  vitamin supplement I wouldn't make a big deal of it. But this isn't a flavor-to-taste product so I think it's an important point.

review/summary: Good on-the-go alternative to regular energy drinks
review/text: This is a decent alternative to the traditional canned energy drinks. I don't think it's going to replace my preferred brand, but I still think I'll keep one of these in the fridge anyway. You basically squeeze some of this concentrated stuff into your water, stir it up, and you're done: your water has become a non-carbonated energy drink. The taste is comparable to Kool-Aid - in other words, it's not horrible, but it's far from great and has that fake sugary juice taste, but then again I don't think many people drink energy drinks for the taste so, well, I can deal with it for the convenience. You can decide your own dosage, so if you want it to be stronger squeeze in some more and if you want less you can make it a bit weaker. You can mix this in a glass of ice water and stir, or you can open a bottle of water, take a sip, squeeze in some of this stuff, close up the bottle and shake it, and you're done. In terms of the level of energy you get from these, your mileage will obviously vary, especially because you're in control of the dosage yourself here. I personally like this for when I'm not up for a full energy drink. I especially like it because I can mix up a bottle and then carry it around all day: I take a travel bottle, fill it to the top with ice, squeeze in some of this stuff and then fill the rest up with water. It's non-carbonated so it doesn't go flat, and the ice keeps it cool for a long time. It's very convenient, and I can forgive the Kool-Aid flavor because of that convenience.<br />(Word of warning: when you squeeze, the liquid jets out pretty strongly, so be careful - this stuff is very concentrated and bright red, you don't want it on your clothes. It splashes even worse if you squeeze it right onto ice, so again, just be aware when you fix your drink so you don't end up with bright red splatters on your clothing!)

review/summary: SodaStream alternative
review/text: The flavor is labeled as fruit punch, and it bears a resemblance to Hi-C Fruit Punch, but not as sugary. With the recommended mixture, it tastes like watered-down Hi-C. If you add more, it tastes fruitier without becoming overly sweet. However, it doesn't taste very natural, again like Hi-C. There are no discernible fruit flavors. It's a vague sort of fruitiness, like Vitamin Water Zero.<br /><br />I also tried it with my SodaStream. The carbonation dulls taste buds, so the soda water needs a lot of syrup for full flavor.<br /><br />It claims to be an energy drink, but I didn't notice any boost in my energy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: All in all, it's not bad, but it's not great. For people who dislike plain water, this makes it less boring without overwhelming you with fruit flavors or sugary sweetness. But if you need energy or something sweet, you should buy a can of soda-pop.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: It was suggested to me that it might be okay for masking the off-flavors of cheap vodka. Not really my thing, but feel free to try.

review/summary: Defective bottle, staining red liquid
review/text: I'm not sure if it was just my bottle that was defective, but the squeeze forced liquid out all over, spraying this highly-staining red liquid all over me, my counter, sink, etc. And trust me - it will stain anything it comes into contact with, including skin!  So frustrating.  On the positive side, it is tasty, reminds me of Kool Aid or Hi C, and I am glad that it does not contain aspartame. With this type of "sports/energy" drink, however, I do prefer actual sugar to feed my body while I am walking/running/hiking/working out.  (Sucralose is the sweetener used in this product.) The caffeine is a mild boost, 40mg per "squeeze."  You can adjust the squeeze to use as much or as little as you'd like, according to your taste and water bottle size (provided that your Vitamin Squeeze bottle is not defective).

I love diet coke, but that's about the limit to artifical sweeteners in my diet, so this might be a good choice if you drink a lot of artificially sweetened fruit drinks. However, if you only dabble in artifical sweeteners, you may find this bland, flat, and really fake tasting, like me.

review/text: Vitamin Squeeze is an innovative all-natural water additive that infuses flavor, vitamins, and caffeine.  The bottle contains 24 squeezes which makes 24 8 ounce glasses of water.  Compared to similar vitamin infused water, you are saving about 50 cents per 16 oz bottle.<br />The fruit punch flavor tastes similar to sugar free kool-aid.  It is sweetened with sucralose and the ascorbic acid from the Vitamin C.  The concentrate is red and will stain your clothes and hands if you don't wash them right away.<br />Each 8 oz serving contains 120% Vitamin C, 40% Vitamins B6, B5, B3, and B12, and 10% chromium and zinc.<br />Does it really give you energy?  Hard to say, because so many other things can factor in, but I drink this at lunch and I do feel like I get a boost through the afternoon.  I have replaced my lunch time diet pop with this which I believe is a healthier alternative.<br />Overall this is a really cool product and healthy alternative to other energy drinks and pops.

review/summary: Good product, bad bottle
review/text: The most important thing about this product is the flavour, so I'll knock out that first.  The initial comparison Vitamin Squeeze will draw in taste is to Kool Aid (and other fruit punches).  It actually tastes quite a bit like the regular red Kool-Aid, but not as sugary and nauseating.  It has a nice, pleasant Kool-Aid taste when used with the "recipe" on the bottle (which is one squeeze for every cup (8 oz) of water).<br /><br />The sweet taste is especially good for this reason: It's actually beneficial in a nutritional sense.  According to the label, Vitamin Squeeze contains 120% of your daily intake of Vitamin C along with different types of Vitamin B, Taurine, and electrolytes (like in Gatorade).  For this, it could be a good replacement to the typical fruit punches, sports drinks, etc., that so many kids have.  Vitamin Squeeze doesn't have all of the sugar and calories that those drinks have (which are some of the worst things you can give a kid).<br /><br />The label, in addition to the vitamin benefits, also claims some energy-drink qualities.  Well, it does have "natural caffeine," but don't expect to get a Red Bull kick or anything like that.  I did notice an upkick in my post workout recovery though.  It may have been placebo, but it's worth noting if you want to treat this like a Gatorade replacement to replenish electrolytes after intense workouts.<br /><br />Now, for my only negative issue with Vitamin Squeeze: The bottle.  I'm hoping I received a dud with the packaging because, from the very beginning, it leaked from under the cap and left what looked like drips of blood all over my floor & countertops.  Since I do plan on trying this product again in the future, I'll update further if I have better or the same packaging.

Also, if you prefer that your water taste more like juice, you will need more than one squirt of this product to accomplish that desire.<br /><br />Keep in mind that it needs to be refrigerated after opening, so it's not really portable.<br /><br />All in all, it's decent, but not anything to write home about.

review/text: I am now a huge fan of water enhancers. The Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch certainly adds delight to this never ending ritual which is so vital to life. I drink water often, more than the recommended daily intake, especially while working out. Having added nutrients to your water makes this more of a conscious effort. Although water by itself is sustaining enough, knowing what you are drinking is packed with nutrients makes you appreciate it more. The packaging is pretty convenient too (worth mentioning). The squeeze bottle is made in such a way that it "responds" to a gentle squeeze, delivering enough of the liquid to enhance your drinking water. I have this both at home and at work, totally taking an ordinary endeavor to new heights! Highly recommended!

review/summary: Enjoyable, but packaging is a another story
review/text: In general, I am not a big fan of the recent "squeeze" drink concentrate fad. I have found most of them to have a slightly-off, artificial taste (one exception: Mio Sweet Tea). However, I find that "Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce" is the exception to the rule. Vitamin rich, it has a very pleasant taste that belies its sugar-free status.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to take the rating of this product down a notch for its packaging. It is extremely easy to dribble and leak if squeezed in the wrong manner, and the coloring is prone to staining. Also, the bottle size is larger than comparable drink products, such as Mio, meaning that it is not the most portable squeeze drink product around.<br /><br />In all, "Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce" is definitely worth picking up for its taste, which is pretty much the best I've had of its kind. Too bad about the packaging, though.

review/summary: Best tasting stuff yet
review/text: I really prefer this to Mio.  It puts a little splash of flavor into your drink, and it has some essential vitamins to boot, to include Electrolytes (it's what plants crave), 10 mg taurine, 10 mg caffeine, 40% each of B1, B5, B6, and B12, and 120% Vitamin C.  NO SUGAR!  I got this stuff mainly for the ENERGY component - i've been working long hours and am not a big fan of coffee, and soda in the morning just doesn't taste the same.  This is a great alternative, tastes sort of like Kool-Aid without the 2 cups of sugar.  However, I don't find the Energy boost to be very substantial.  It has slightly less caffeine per serving than the average soda, and about half the caffeine than a cup of coffee.  I would not rely on this as an energy boost, unless maybe you were to squeeze in 5 servings into a bottle of water.<br /><br />As an added benefit, I also use this stuff in water to give to my kid when they ask for juice.  She really likes it, and can't tell the difference.  I have always had sensitive/weak teeth, so I try to keep sugars out of her diet as much as I can, so the fact that I can give her juice without her knowing it is a great thing, plus it's easy to transport and give to her on-the-go.  All you need is a water bottle and the Vitamin Squeeze!  Plus, I don't find any more fermented apple juice sippy cups in the back of my car anymore!<br /><br />MY ONLY ISSUE with this product (hence the 4-star review) is the function of the bottle.  It seems clean and easy, but the design is flawed.  The bottle is designed to be stored upside-down.  The problem is that the nozzle leaks.  When the cap is closed, no product will come out, so it's not like it will seep out of its container altogether; however, when inverted, the gravity causes small amounts of product to ooze out of the nozzle and into the cap.  Then, when you open the cap, that oozed product drips out (because you have it inverted) and lands on your floor or counter.  Well, the first time this happened, i got some on my hardwood floor and my cheap, laminate countertop.  The dog cleaned the stuff from the floor, and I was too lazy to wipe the stuff off the counter.  Later on, when I tried to clean it off the counter, I found that no amount of cleaner or scrubbing would completely remove the red splotch from the surface.  I spilled it again in a different spot, and cleaned it up immediately.  There is still a visible splotch, but it's not red in color.  I don't know why this stuff stains so quickly and so well, but it's a problem.  It's easily fixed by storing the bottle upright.<br /><br />If anyone has any suggestions on a homemade concoction that will take out a red stain from a countertop, please let me know.  Maybe I can get Ecosentials, LLC (the maker of this product) get buy me new countertops?

review/summary: Just okay
review/text: I am not really thrilled about the taste of the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink product, it is something to make your water a bit more tasty but I still have a 1/2 of a bottle and don't think I will use it.  I really prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006CMVE7S">Mio Liquid Water Enhancer 3 Pack Variety</a>.  The Mio brand has much more flavor and you only need a small squirt so it is more compact.  This Vitamin Energy Squeeze is the same amount of servings as a small Mio bottle so you have to use more.<br /><br />The Vitamin Squeeze is just okay in flavor.  It just doesn't have the really fruity flavor that I am looking for.<br /><br />Also, you might want to know that it does contain CAFFEINE.

A quick squirt in a glass of water was perfect. It reminded me of a blend of Propel and a Vitamin Water. Im not a big fan of sweet sports drinks and often water down my gatorade or powerade because it is too sweet. This is a perfect option for someone looking for a great tasting drink with good flavor that isnt too sweet.

review/text: The Fruit Punch taste is not what you associate an energy drink with, it reminded me of the big jug of juice you get at the store full of teeth eating sugar. As for a boost of energy I don't think it really did much for me. If it was a different flavor it might have been a little better.<br /><br />It's a nice idea but I give a no on the taste.

review/text: This is really a great product. Compared to the other water enhancers, this one is far and above. The vitamin content is attractive, the flavor is pleasing, the price is right.<br /><br />One drawback: it requires refrigeration. So many times I would grab a bottle of water and down it before I realized I had the Vitamin Squeeze in the fridge. Forget about throwing it in your backpack and taking it with you. That's kind of unfortuante really. It's a much better product than something like Mio - except for that.

review/summary: I guess its O.K.
review/text: The Fruit punch flavor of this water flavoring featuring  Vitamin C  is O.K. though it took quite a bit more product than the instructions called for to give any noticeable fruit punch flavor to the water. I noticed a distinct bitter chemical aftertaste which was not the taste I usually get from vitamin C. I am one of those people who can taste some things that most people can not taste and some of my family members did not find this product bitter and some did. I really like the idea of a water enhancer that includes vitamin C but this particular product was not one I enjoyed enough to continue drinking.

review/summary: Not bad, but I wish it didn't have caffeine
review/text: As a fan of several of the flavored water brands, I thought I might enjoy Vitamin Squeeze's Energy Drink in Fruit Punch.  The flavor is pretty good, and I like the fact it has several vitamins (C,B6,B12,E,A).  I don't love that it contains caffeine (but maybe you will).  A lot of the reason, I like these drinks is to change up the water routine without consuming caffeine.  The size of this container is good...much bigger than Mio.  It is overall a good value.  You should know it contains caffeine but if that doesn't bother you, then it is a good product at a good value.

review/summary: The taste just wasn't there for me
review/text: I consume vitamin drinks pretty regularly. I just couldn't get into the taste of this product. It was a bit bland and I wasn't comfortable with the amount I had to use to make it taste "right" in my water. Even after 2 1/2 squeezes it still tasted like a powder drink with no sugar added. I was really hoping for a better experience.<br />I also wasn't too happy with the ingredient list:<br />Water, Citric Acid, Vitamin C, Natural Flavor, Sucralose, Natural Caffeine, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Magnesium Lactate, Gluconate Vitamin B3, Taurine, Vitabin B5, Calcium Lactate, Gum Acacia, Glyceryl, Abietate, Red 40, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12<br /><br />I think they should have added 10 calories and went with a more natural sugar to kick up the flavor a bit.<br /><br />For those that are okay with drinking just water and just want to add some vitamins to the experience - this may be the product for you. If you are trying to eat/drink better and want to give up soda for something "healthy", the bland flavor may not do it for you.

review/summary: I'll Stick with MiO, Thanks
review/text: Well following in the footsteps of the successful MiO comes Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink. From a practical standpoint Vitamin Squeeze has a lot going for it. All you need is some water, squirt in some Vitamin Squeeze and bada bing, you now have an energy drink. The drink additive boasts zero calories, zero carbs, and zero sugar. That alone is pretty impressive coming from something labeled as an energy drink. Then of course Vitamin Squeeze is loaded with a fair share of vitamins and I suppose that could be a big benefit for the right consumer.<br /><br />On the other hand I doubt very many people who are concerned with vitamins and healthy beverages will be attracted to the Fruit Punch flavor. I can still occasionally stomach ultra-sugary Kool-Aid or Hi-C and I think that the MiO Fruit Punch is actually on of the better flavors the brand offers. Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch, however, has all the overly sweet taste of these other products with the addition of a nasty tang, probably due to the Vitamin C. At least that is what I'm guessing the bad after taste comes from because I've had the same experience with other Vitamin C beverage enhancers. Either way, the flavor is pretty gross.<br /><br />The other thing about Vitamin Squeeze you need to take into account is the fact that it is far less versatile than MiO or even just bottled drinks. You have to carry around the large, 12-ounce container PLUS whatever you are flavoring with it. It's just not mobile really.<br /><br />***EDIT***<br />I added a third star because I my little brother drinks this stuff all the time and he actually enjoys it.

review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink (Fruit Punch) is a squeeze bottle filled with concentrated energy drink.  Vitamin Squeeze is formulated for bottled water drinkers.  Each bottle is filled with enough for 15 half liter bottles.  Every blast comes with caffeine and Vitamin C for those health conscience consumers.  If you're looking for a quick jolt either in the morning, afternoon or during your work out, then I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: A Tasty Way To Take Your Vitamins
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink makes a few claims on its bottle.  Those claims include providing 120% of your daily recommended amount of Vitamin C, 40% of a number of B vitamins, and energy from those B vitamins, caffeine, and Taurine, as well as electrolytes.  It also states that it is "nutritious and delicious."<br /><br />While I'll agree on the delicious part and the amount of vitamins it provides, I have my doubts about the "energy" factor of this water enhancer.<br /><br />The taste really is good.  I was given the fruit punch flavor and enjoyed it very much.  Supposedly one squeeze is all you need (per directions), but there's no specific guideline as to how much a "squeeze" really is.  Sure, there are hash marks on the bottle to help you in your squeezing, but the bottle has no place at which to see inside of it to see how much of the enhancer you've squeezed out.  I just decided to go with the flavor of the enhancer.  If the water tasted too watery, I simply squeezed in more of the enhancer.<br /><br />I drank this while working out, adding it to my water while I exercised.  I felt no energetic boost from it whatsoever, but I do prefer its taste over plain old water.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good taste enhancer for water, but if you want an energy boost, look elsewhere.

review/text: The biggest benefit to having <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQMC">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> is being able to take less water weight with you.  If you are out hiking or somewhere else where water is available from a water fountain or stream (filter anything from a stream before drinking it) where you can get water along the way and add some flavor and vitamins with this product.  It will be lighter and easier than carrying bottles of some sort of sports drink with you.<br /><br />It tastes like Kool-Aid.  It's not delicious, not horrible, just sort of OK. There are, of course, a lot of other powdered and concentrated liquid mixes (similar to this one) that would serve the same purpose.  Nothing about this Vitamin Squeeze makes it stand out from anything else.  It has no calories which probably means it has chemicals instead of sugar.<br /><br />It is not something I'd be likely to purchase but if you need something more than water when you would otherwise have to either carry a lot of water weight or spend a couple bucks for each 16oz sports drink while out on the road this product may be more convenient and/or save you money.

review/text: Hawaiian punch is that you?!  No, it must be your fortified with vitamins caffeinated cousin.<br /><br />This drink is good, simply squirt into a water bottle (serving size suggests you can get 24 "squirts" out of one bottle, but that is heavily dependent on your preferred desired strength) and shake.  I liked it.  Tastes exactly like Hawaiian Punch to me, and if you can remember your childhood at all - thats not a bad thing.<br /><br />It does not provide enough caffeine for me to give up my daily cup of coffee (like I would anyways!) but for those trying to find a caffeine alternative - this still probably is not it.  My husband who drinks a zip fizz daily was not able to use this to replace his zip fizz since it contains significantly less...everything.<br /><br />It is a little weak in the vitamin department too, basing a lot of its energy drink claims on a high does of vitamin B.<br /><br />It is good, overall, just not a health drink or real energy drink by any means if you're used to something with a real kick.<br /><br />Check out the nutritional data to see if it meets your needs before buying!

review/summary: I wasn't very impressed...
review/text: I'm not a regular customer of 'energy' products.  In the past I've ordered and reviewed another pre-made energy drink.  I have now fallen in love with Crystal Light's Wild Strawberry-Energy.  I opted to get this supplement/energy drink through Vine.  The price is reasonable.  One container holds a pretty large amount of servings.  Let me tell you WHY I only gave this product 3 stars:<br /><br />***The bottle is 'confusing':  Before anybody makes comments about my being illiterate or something equivalent to it, let me explain.  The manufacturer has you measure the serving size by placing lines  on the wrapper.  However there is NO WAY to see inside the container to determine if you've measured the correct amount.  This makes a user have to guess and add more, if needed, based on taste.  What they SHOULD have done is place a see-through section next to the lines so you can see where you need to stop.<br /><br />***The flavor leaves a lot to be desired.  I drank one cup of it and I think that will have been the only cup.  Granted, it has no calories or anything but flavoring.  I am able to drink Crystal Light with artificial sweetener and regular sodas with sugar or corn syrup.  Vitamin Squeeze, however, just didn't taste good.  Maybe it was because it has no sweetener in it and I tend to dislike drinks that fall in that category.  You, on the other hand, may enjoy unsweetened drinks.  If that's the case, you MAY like it.  (In my defense I have enjoyed flavored water in the past that was completely unsweetened so it may simply be the product.)<br /><br />To sum it all up, I didn't like it and don't like the design of the bottle label.

If this is something that would fit your taste then go for it, but I personally did not feel any energy from drinking this just the sweetness.<br /><br />Be cautioned if you are purchasing this product that it is sweet tasting and it did not have the extra energy you might be wanting or needing throughout your day. Give me a good cup of coffee any time to this. I hope this review helps you make an informed decision on your purchase.

review/summary: Tastes great, but doesn't give much of a boost.
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink Fruit Punch is probably one of the better-tasting energy drink mixes that I've tried. Where so many really lack in the taste department (so much so that you have to force yourself to drink a lot of them), the Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch actually had me coming back for more. It's also convenient. Squeeze in your punch mix (roughly one squeeze per 8 ounces of water), top it off with water and stir. If there's not enough flavor for you (or one would presume, energy kick as well), then add a bit more. At the recommended serving ratio, the taste is light and refreshing and not-at-all syrupy.<br /><br />The issue that I have with the Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch is that it really didn't seem to provide much of an actual energy boost. If you're used to standard energy drinks or workout drinks, you're probably not going to get much of an energy kick here. It's on par with a caffeinated soda, which while certainly caffeinated, the actual content is a good bit less than someone looking for an "energy drink" would normally expect, so keep that in mind. It does have the obligatory smattering of vitamins and minerals as well.<br /><br />The Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink Fruit Punch certainly tastes good, but unless you don't normally partake in caffeine, there's not going to be the energy drink-like boost that you're used to (might be a good product for those who don't normally drink a lot of caffeinated beverages, as the content is pretty low; 40 mg per 8 ounce serving). It tastes good and is calorie-free (sucralose), so with the vitamins, it's certainly a healthier alternative than a lot of the other products out there.

review/text: I am not a big water drinker but I am trying to be.  What I like about the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is that it comes in a large 12-ounce bottle and is not only all natural but zero calories.  I will say though even though it says the cap is specially designed for no drips, I had issues with getting it to seal right.  The flavoring was fine for me, tasted like fruit punch but not overwhelming - although I did add more than you probably should!  I don't know that I necessarily felt an energy bust but it definitely was better than plain water. It does have to be refrigerated which is nice because it adds for a colder drink but it is also not portable though.  I think I can stretch this bottle for a month and will definitely be looking for it again!

It's priced at $23 for 4 packs. That seems like a lot, but you get a lot more drinks per bottle. You also have to use each bottle within 30 days of opening it. I love the taste even though it's a little watery with just one squeeze. My biggest complaint is that it cost $23, I can't see myself paying that much. I also didn't feel a strong energy push from it.

review/summary: Convenient, healthier alternative
review/text: Used to drinking a sugared-caffeinated soda for your afternoon kick?  This isn't going to provide the same results.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze is going to have greater appeal to those who drink plain or flavored water or are looking for a healthy alternative to what they've been drinking.  A squirt (24 per bottle) into 8 oz of water gives you 120% of Vitamin C, 40% of B3, B5, B6 and B12, 40 mg of natural caffeine and 10 mg of Taurine without any calories, carbs, sugar or sodium.<br /><br />The flavor is mild fruit punch, although you can make it stronger by adding more squeeze (meaning you won't get 24 servings out of the bottle).  If you normally drink plain water the normal squeeze is enough to liven it up.  And 24 servings per bottle with 4 bottles per pack at $23.92 per pack, the cost is  .25 per serving, a much cheaper and convenient alternative to bottled beverages.<br /><br />Alas, I'm a Coke drinker (1 per day), so while I enjoy the flavor and knowledge that I'm drinking something much better for my body, even though it has more mg of caffeine than my Coke, the lack of the caffeine/sugar combo means I don't notice the same boost of energy from this.  My soda-free co-workers do see a difference.<br /><br />5 stars for the health benefits, the flavor, price per serving and convenience.  But until I can break the sugar habit, this isn't coming across as an energy drink for me.  Still drinking it for the vitamins, though.

This is a decent alternative if flavored water is your thing.  Below I've outlined the highlights of both good and bad:<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />*  It's convenient.  It fits easily in the fridge and can even be stored in the pantry (I think?).  Much better than a gigantic jug of juice.<br />*  It's kind of nice to be able to control the intensity of the flavor.  If it's not strong enough, just squeeze a little more.<br />*  I suppose it's reasonably healthy.  I couldn't find anything objectionable.<br />*  The taste is good - if you like the Kool-Aid taste.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />*  I have no idea how to read the chart on the back.  It's suppose to indicate how many squeezes to flavor X amount of water.  What's one squeeze?  You could eject half the contents of the bottle out with one squeeze if you wanted to.  The best method is the taste test, but this is a little subjective.<br />*  It stains BAD and it stains FAST.  The first time I used it, a dab of juice concentrate plopped out of my glass of water onto the butcher-block counters.  I left it for a few minutes while I finished the drink and took it to my wife for the first trial.  By the time I wiped it up, it had already stained - and it's still there today.  Be careful with this stuff.<br />*  The taste is good - but ONLY if you like the Kool-Aid taste.<br /><br />Not much else to say.  The product basically works as advertised.

review/summary: sweet, fruity, tasty, a yummy mix-in
review/text: The bottle seemed to indicate "one squeeze" per 8 oz. So, I filled a water bottle to the 8 oz mark, and did one "squeeze." - Well, my squeeze, was one full press-in until there no longer comes out the mix-in. Well, that added about 4 oz of flavour. So...I had to add about 12 oz of water. 20 oz to the 4 oz of "one squeeze"  is fine, but for me, that is was still a bit too sweet. So, 20 oz to 4 oz. is just right. Sweet and fruity tasting, but not too overwhelming or sweet to make it undrinkable or unpleasant to drink.<br />I enjoy the flavour. It has that nice sweet-fruity taste, but doesn't taste too much like that fake fruit or something sweet but loses the fruity taste.<br />I REALLY enjoy the taste (leaves no aftertaste and is not overpowering with any lingering or tasting bad after eating something such as crackers - I tried some flavoured Triscuts -and the flavour of the fruit - I LOVE fruit. It's not a distinct 'strawberry' or 'raspberry,' but a mixed fruit, almost like a fruit punch, but not quite. I think both children, teens, and adults would find this a very palatable and enjoyable vitamin mix-in for all to enjoy.<br /><br />The bottle nutrition facts labels one serving as 1/2 oz. - so my guess is that is what "one squeeze" means.<br /><br />*The 'lift' tab to open it doesn't really help - one has to just pull up and off the seal.<br />*Be CAREFUL when pulling off the seal; the juice-vitatmin mix slopped out and sloshed onto me. The pink-red mixture MIGHT stain, but if you dab it off, spray it with something like Spray & Wash (or maybe rubbing Fel's Naptha - or use both) to get it off.

review/summary: Finally... Something for BOTH Energy & Sport Drink fans
review/text: This liquid is designed for flavoring water and adding vitamins.  Many of these drinks are out there right now, but this is one of the few that includes caffeine and taurine in addition to the vitamins.<br /><br />To me, this tastes like Sports drinks when added to water.  But with the extras in there like caffeine, you can add this to carbonated water / club soda to make an energy drink instead.  The main difference between the two drink types is only the fizz, so easily enough you can make the choice for yourself on how you prefer Vitamin Squeeze.<br /><br />I always believed that the sport and energy drink families should have been intermingling many years ago.  In fact, I was adding them together for workouts up until I found this product.  Cool idea... this should've been done a long time ago.

review/summary: Not horrible and not delicious...I would not buy on my own!
review/text: I have been trying to find some liquids healthier than sodas/drinks to drink.  Thus, when I saw this Squeeze drink, I thought I would give it a try.  The directions say ONE squeeze per 8 ounce bottle.  I did the one squeeze and the drink tastes like a strawberry version of gatorade.  It is not bad tasting and not good tasting; it tastes "ahright."<br /><br />The labelling indicates that it is an energy drink.  I have been drinking it and I don't feel any added energy.<br /><br />One commenter said she had to poke a hole through the top.  If you unscrew the top, there is a label that needs to be pulled off.  When you pull off the label, the opening will be clear as a bell and the liquid will flow through.<br /><br />In summation:<br /><br />This drink tastes so-so.  It is hard to open with all the wrapping.  It doesn't give you any energy.

review/summary: Diversionary squeeze play
review/text: I've been searching for a new product to satiate my junk drink fix I could leave in plain sight ever since the homefront Stasi confiscated my stock of sugar laden 'fruit' drinks and carbonated beverages, going so far as to initiate daily inspections of MY basement sanctuary refrigerator.  She only descends to the dungeon once a week to do laundry asserting I have rendered the place otherwise uninhabitable yet now she has no qualms about daily covert excursions to embargo my stash.<br /><br />Despite my high hopes, Vitamin Squeeze can only serve as a red herring for my personal nutrition inspector Javert because although it is minimally acceptable for quick hydration, it will not compel me to skip the beverage aisle to replenish my cache of Hawaiian punch, Pepsi and orange crush (Okay,  some peppery V8, orange and apple juice as well but they detract from my riff). The product seems convenient and reasonably easy to use although determining consistent squeeze pressure to accommodate my taste preferences in 8 oz. of water is a challenge.<br /><br />My first attempt resulted in four times the suggested amount so I guess me and the product manufacturer have widely disparate perceptions of general squeeze pressure. That rate would result in merely six glasses per container. Only afterwards did I notice the striations on the side of the bottle which approximate the recommended squeeze amount of � oz. per 8 oz. glass, so long as the bottle's solution level is visually discernible with offset illumination.<br /><br />But, I guess I am consistent since I didn't notice the perforations around the cap wrapping until I had stabbed it with a steak knife either. Once the tabbed safety seal is removed, also be sure to replace the cardboard washer correctly or it is quite likely you will end up with a syrupy fruit punch stain wherever the inverted bottle is to be stored.<br /><br />Even so, I wasn't enthusiastic about the sweetness or aftertaste with the suggested application - or my prodigious proportion - as in each instance a metallic aftertaste was evident, in the case of the reduced amount simply in what looked like watered down Hawaiian punch. That said, in either case it is a vast improvement over the saltiness of Gatorade.<br /><br />On the positive side at that rate using it up within 30 days shouldn't be a problem, in fact using it up in a couple of exercise sessions is nearly guaranteed. Since the container appeared so portable and the enhancer is obviously much more soluble than a powdery type addictive, one of my brilliant ideas was to keep a container in my car since I tend consume a lot of appreciably less healthy fluids while driving between business sites but the instructions also suggest refrigeration after opening so how that will work out is yet to be determined.

review/summary: A Squeeze is all you need
review/text: Great new product, I have tried 3 of the 4 flavors... TROPICAL CITRUS; ACAI, GRAPE POMEGRANATE and Energy PEACH GREEN TEA. I work in a high school and I am always getting sick.  I have been drinking Vitamin Squeeze for several months now and HAVE NOT BEEN SICK ONCE...this is the only thing I have done differently!  I don't like the taste of the tap water at the school, so this product is ideal for changing the tap water into a drink that is delicious and motivates me to drink more water. Finally, a truly great drink, which is much better than MIO and half the price of Vitaminwater! All it takes is a "little" squeeze for me.  Vitamin Squeeze does not leave an aftertaste like some 0 calorie products.  0 calorie, 0 carbs, 0 sugar!  Love it! My teens think the Tropical Citrus tastes like Tang or a Creamsicle. I am headed back to Safeway to get more!  I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Good source of Vitamin C
review/text: I found the fruit punch flavor of the Vitamin Squeeze energy drink to be far superior to other vitamin enhanced beverages such as vitaming water.  One squeeze in a 12 oz glass of water givers you 120% of your daily intake of vitamin C and about 40% of your daily minimum requirements of most of the B vitamins.<br /><br />I was pleased to discover that one bottle can refresh 24 glasses of water meaning it will last more than a day.  You can also do about three squirts in your canteen when you go hiking for a refreshing break.<br /><br />I did like the punch flavor.  It was not overpowering and brought some life to my tapwater.  My kids like it too so that is a plus.<br /><br />Overall it is a no cal super influx of vitamins to your diet, better than soda, and very good for you.

There are 24 squeezes/servings per bottle. Having these benefits being just a "squeeze away" are cool for my at-home life. At current price, $24 for 4 bottles it's $.25 per serving. It has ZERO calories due to the artificial sweetener sucralose - generic Splenda.<br /><br />I prefer the flexibility of pre-measured powder packet to add to my re-fillable water bottle while on-the-go.

review/summary: Better Off Mio
review/text: I got this product because I was getting low on the Mio liquid I had and this seemed similar.  It is similar, though with a couple of differences.<br /><br />First, this is more like the Mio Energy line than the regular kind.  Ironically about the time I got this product in the mail I decided I should cut back on caffeine; this product has 40mg of "natural" caffeine, D'OH!<br /><br />Second, while Mio liquid does not have to be refrigerated, this product should be refrigerated according to the label.  If you're just using it at home then it's not a big deal to keep it in the fridge.  But if you were thinking of taking it with you maybe to work or while exercising or on vacation or something, then forget about it.<br /><br />As for the taste, I thought it was OK.  I like the Mio fruit punch I have better.  So overall I'd just stick with the Mio liquid.<br /><br />That is all.

review/text: This drink tastes as good or better than similar drinks that we've had that are made of powder.  The directions don't tell you how much to squeeze into your water, so I would imagine it depends on how big of a glass or bottle you have and how strong you want it to taste.  You can always add more.  The only concern I have about it is there is caffeine in it and I really don't want to have any extra caffeine after my coffee in the morning.  You might want to beware of that if you are buying this for children.

review/summary: A Pretty Good Value...
review/text: If you are looking for a water flavoring product, there's been a lot of powders out there to choose from.  Somewhat recently, there's been a new trend of liquid additives that you can put into your water to make it less boring.  The obvious advantage of a liquid additive is that you don't have the mess and hassle of powdering spilling everywhere.  It's quick, convenient, and easy.<br /><br />Now, what sets this Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink apart from competitors such as the MIO things?  Well, mostly price.  I noticed that this is a much larger item, and per ounce, is a much better value.  As for taste, I've had tastier water flavorings.  In fact, if you can believe this, the tastiest thing I've tried is an off-brand MIO knock-off (I believe the brand was Fit & Active).  The taste of this Vitamin Squeeze flavoring is sort of bland (but also calorie free, so that's nice), and then if you increase the amount used, just gets too strong.  There's just never a point where I felt like it was just right, even though I experimented with how many squeezes to use.  That being said, the taste is tolerable and not too bad.<br /><br />All in all, I wouldn't buy this drink flavoring just for it's taste alone (although you may want it for the vitamins in it).  I would, however, recommend it just for being the best value that I've seen so far for a product of its type.  If you need a liquid water flavoring at the best price possible (as of this review writing), this is the product to go with for sure.

review/text: For me, I like these squeezable flavors. I like Mio too, but this one is much bigger and seems to last much longer for the same cost.  Make sure to refrigerate as instructed.  It also says it should be used within 30 days of opening, that shouldn't be too hard and probably isn't that big of a deal, but good to note.  I usually use half the suggested "squirts" because I like a more subtle flavor, the same with this fruit punch version.  Personally, I think this is a great idea and great alternative to water. No carbs, no sugar, lots of vitamins and...chemicals - what could be better????

review/summary: Tastes Good!...
review/text: I really liked this product, though it did take a couple uses to get it just right. I've found that a little definitely goes a long way. For an 8 oz glass of water, you just want to give the bottle a quick squeeze...any more than that and it's too sweet/strong.<br /><br />Also, you're gonna want to drink this rather quickly. I'm not someone who guzzles their drinks quickly (I can make a single bottle of water last an entire day), and the first time I tried this I took a couple sips, set it on the table and picked it up again after about a half hour or so...YUCK! It was not good. I don't know what happened in that 30 minutes to make the taste change so much, but it's certainly better when it's cold. Overall though, it's pretty good! It has a strong fruit punch flavor, and is much more enjoyable than a glass of plain 'ol water.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised!
review/text: As I'm writing this review, I'm drinking a bottle of water that I've used this product with. The fruit punch flavor is nice, and having this product sure makes it convenient to add those "vitamins" to your drink. Overall, I'm very happy with the product, but only have two complaints. If indicates 1 squeeze for every 8 ounces. What exactly is 1 squeeze? Is it a long squeeze? A short squeeze? I don't feel I've completely found the happy medium yet. The first time I tried the product,  I found I had to squeeze it about 3-4 times to get enough saturation in the drink to actually taste the fruit punch and act more like I'd expect it to be. Subsequent uses I've done longer squeezes, and that seems to do the trick. Sometimes I do find I've squeezed too much though, and have more flavor than I'd prefer. The other complaint I have isn't necessary due to the product itself, but due to water bottles. They're filled to the brim when you get them, so in order to use this product you have to drink some. Not a big deal, and not really a fault of the product itself, but is definitely an inconvenience. Overall, however, this is a great way to add some flavor and vitamins to your drink without having to pickup vitamin water or a sport drink. Just buy the regular bottled water, and when you feel you need some flavor, just squeeze a decent amount in, and you'll be set.

review/summary: Pretty Good, Just Watch for the Contents
review/text: First, let me state the taste isn't bad at all, almost tastes like it has sugar but it doesn't.  Instead it contains Sucralose.<br /><br />Now for the energy part.  Part of its jolt comes from 40mg of along with a good dose of Taurine.  That's not a problem.<br /><br />What is a problem is the portion recommended which is 1/2 ounce.  Allegedly you get 24 servings in this bottle but I guess that depends upon what you consider a glass of water.  I found that most bottled waters took at least a double dose to get decent flavor and that means doubling the dose of caffeine and Taurine.<br /><br />As I soon discovered, that means jitters, especially if you've had anything else containing caffeine (such as my morning cup of Joe).<br /><br />Overall, this isn't bad and if you use tap water or purify your own it's definitely cheaper than buying energy water in the store.

review/summary: It's Okay
review/text: This product claims to add two things to water: flavor and an energy boost.<br /><br />The flavor is pretty good, sweet but not too sweet, like a punch made from all-natural juices.  Getting it just right is difficult, though, because of the inexact science of mixing it with the right amount of water.  The bottle says "one squeeze per eight ounces," but a squeeze can be very short or very long, so it's hard to know how much to use.  The bottle says it contains 24 squeezes, but unless you want to measure 1/24th of the bottle with a measuring spoon or mix the whole bottle in with a gallon and a half of water right away and draw from that supply, that's no help.  I tended to err on the side of more rather than less; underestimating the squeeze produced a pretty watery flavor.<br /><br />As for energy, it didn't do much for me.  When it first came in the mail I immediately poured a glass of water and mixed it in while sitting around.  At that point I thought I felt a little energy boost; but when I would drink it during a workout, I found it was no more revitalizing than plain water.<br /><br />So call it two and a half stars: four stars for the flavor, one for the (lack of) energy boost.

review/summary: Easy way to flavor your water, or your kids' water!
review/text: Fruit punch may not be my favorite flavor, but I've been enjoying a daily glass of Vitamin Squeeze as a break from water.  My favorite thing about Vitamin Squeeze is its customizable flavor.  My 15 year old daughter prefers two squeezes in 8 oz, which is twice the recommendation.  I prefer one long squeeze in 16 oz. of water. I don't like a heavy flavor.<br /><br />The bottle was very easy to squeeze, but that was also a negative.  It was hard to control exactly how much you put in.  Some water glasses were more strongly flavored than others.  I appreciate that it immediately disperses in the water, without having to be shaken or stirred.<br /><br />It was very easy to put a little squirt into my toddler's water cup, and know she's enjoying a little flavor along with vitamins.  My children would drink it all day long, if I let them.  I would prefer serving them this rather than a sugary flavored beverage ... but the cost is too high.  My children could easily finish two of the $6 bottles in a week.<br /><br />So, while we enjoy the Vitamin Squeeze, it's not a practical option for our entire family. At least not on a daily basis.

review/summary: "Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink"
review/text: For those of us who drink several bottles of water each day, Vitamin Squeeze adds zest to our lives. One squirt of Vitamin Squeeze will transform your ordinary bottle of water into a yummy vitamin packed tasty drink. The 12 fluid once bottle contains twenty-four (24) squirts, so each bottle goes a long way. One squirt will provide 120% of the USDA daily requirement for Vitamin C and 40% for vitamins B3, B5, B6 & B12. With no calories, sugar or carbohydrates, you get the nutrition and delicious taste without the weight gain.<br /><br />It does contain Red 40 to give it the red color. In my opinion, removing the Red 40 and leaving the drink clear would be an improvement. Also, being that Vitamin Squeeze is a concentrate 24:1, and contains 40 mg of natural caffeine, I would keep it out of reach of small children.

review/summary: Good flavor, good energy, no calories
review/text: I've tried a few different products to give some flavor to water without adding a lot of sugar or calories, and this one compares well with the other options on the market.  It has no calories, but lots of vitamins and some caffeine for energy (I should warn people with caffeine sensitivities that you have to look closely on the label to see that there are 40 mg of caffeine per serving).  It dissolves very well in water, even without stirring.  Taste-wise, I was unimpressed at the recommended one-squeeze serving - it wasn't a strong enough flavor for me to pick up anything but a little citrus bitterness, but by doubling the amount of energy fluid, the fruit punch taste was refreshing and pleasant, with a little more complexity than I expected from the name.  This is a good product for people who prefer drinking water but want a little variety without sacrificing their fitness/nutritional goals.

review/summary: Okay, Not Great
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch flavor tastes okay but not great. I had three other people try this product and no one was really blown away by the taste. Two of the individuals felt like there was a slight after taste. If you like the taste it does provide vitamins B3, B6, and B12, Vitamin C, Zinc, Magnesium, Chromium, and caffeine that is about the equivalent of a can of soda.  If you are sensitive to caffeine you should stay away from this product. Also, it does contain the artificial sweetener sucralose which many people do not like and will not consume.<br /><br />It is designed for an 8 ounce serving of water although most water bottles are 16 ounces so you will need to adjust the serving amount as necessary. The bottle is large and not what I would consider portable so you may need to prepare your drink ahead of time.<br /><br />There are a lot of similar products on the market and Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink does not really distinguish itself in a crowded market. The bottle is large, not convenient to carry with you in a workout bag for the gym or backpack on a hike. And, sucralose is an artificial sweetener that I would rather avoid. This is a product that is average at best. It is far from exceptional but not terrible. It will really come down to your taste preference.

review/text: I'm always looking for a good energy drink, that will give me a boost, but not a big let down.  I like the glaceau energy water.  This is a good alternative.  This makes 24 8-ounce servings, at $6 a bottle it's only 25 cents a glass vs $1.50 or so for the vitamin water by glaceau or others found in the supermarkets and  convenience stores.<br />  The flavor is like a light fruit punch. You can control how much you want to add to your water for taste.  It has a combination of vitamins B 6, 5, 3, and 12, Vitamin C, Zinc, Magnesium, and Chromium.  It has about the same amount of caffeine as a can of soda, so not too much, no jittery feeling after drinking it.<br />  It is good to get healthy vitamins while I'm drinking water and not just sugar and caffeine from sodas.
