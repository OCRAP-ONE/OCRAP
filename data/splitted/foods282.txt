review/summary: buy at Wegman's - shipping is ridiculous
review/text: This product tastes good, but you can buy it for $9 at Wegman's. If you get it from this place, you pay $26 (TWENTY SIX!) for shipping and handling. Why? All I found was a freezer pack! What a ripoff. When I asked about the high shipping, the response was fairly snotty. When we received the product, we found it labeled "specially selected for Wegman's." Sure enough, next time we went, there it was. In addition, two of the containers had an expiration in two weeks! All in all, the shipping costs make this a big ripoff. Get it at Wegman's.

review/text: Having read previous reviews, I was prepared for the taste of coconut water. I chose Vita Coconut Water w/ Acai & Pomegranate because of the hydrating, weight loss and heart healthy beneficial attributes. I actually liked the fresh taste and found nyself choosing it whenever I desired something to drink. I also am pleased with the container which I prefer to plastic bottles. I definately noticed a shift in my weight and change in my appetite after only a few days. I am strongly considering subscibing delivery as I have not found the product in any stores I patronize.

review/text: I love Vita Coco, so I've been trying out different varieties when I can find them.  This one is not as good as the plain one, in my opinion.  Tastes a little weird, actually.  It's like the coconut water version of what some of the regular water companies do when they add a "twist of lemon" or something.  Strange.<br />It's not so offensive that I won't be drinking it, but I won't be ordering any more if the plain version is available.

review/text: I just received my 12 pack of Acai Pomegranate Vita Coco Coconut Water from Amazon.<br /><br />Wow!! I love the new twist off cap!! I have been waiting for Vita Coco to come out with a more user friendly packaging (to work out with). Now I can go to yoga and open and close my drink, that way I can have some throughout my practice. Unlike water, Vita Coco keeps me hydrated and gives me the potassium and electrolytes I need while working out. The incorporation of acai with coconut water is delicious! The combination of nutrients, amino acids, antioxidants, vitamins and other properties make acai one of the wonders of the natural food kingdom!<br /><br />Now the yoga studios I go to, even carry Vita Coco (for the times I do not have one on hand!) I will definitely spread the word of this amazing hydration drink!

review/summary: A delicious change of pace for electrolyte replacement drinks
review/text: For anyone looking for a healthy alternative to the current slew of electrolyte replacement drinks on the market - you have just found your holy grail of thirst quenchers.  The drink when served ice cold is extremely refreshing and healthy at the same time.  I love the fact that is has 15 times the potassium of other drinks on the market but is completely natural.  Vitacoco has no sugar added so someone looking for an extremely sweet experience will be let down.<br /><br />As for the previous reviewer who said this flavor tastes like watered down tomato juice - I just don't taste it.  It has a hint of pomegranate and acai flavor but the coconut water still comes through clean and strong.  He was probably just not expecting the taste you get from coconut water - which granted is different - but look at the state of health overall in this country and you will agree different is just what we need!!!<br /><br />What more can I say - all natural coconut juice with no preservatives or additives and a hint of real juice flavor.  Delicious and refreshing.

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: I decided to give this product a try after reading all of the health benefits. I wanted to try something new and healthy.<br /><br />I cannot stand the taste of this drink. It tastes like very watered down tomato juice. It is just not for me. If you like tomato juice, or watered down tomato juice, then maybe you will like this product, but it just does not appeal to me in the least. (The tomato taste comes from the Pomegranate).<br /><br />The little containers are nice. They have a twist off cap which is also nice. My shipping box was totally destroyed though. There was no tape on the one side, so the box was completely open. The case to the drinks itself was tore open too. All of the juice containers were laid inside the shipping box, since the product box was tore open. I am thinking this happened during transit, but there is no way to tell for sure. I get UPS deliveries almost every day and have never had something arrive in poor condition like this, so I don't know what happened there.<br /><br />Anyway, I do not recommend this product. The flavor was horrible and very bland. Others may like it if they like very bland/watered down tomato juice products or very bland Pomegranate products. You DO NOT taste any coconut flavor at all!

review/text: I never thought I'd get this excited over a candy bar, but when I found out that Snickers Almond Bars are very similar to the old Mars Bar (which is no longer available)... well, I bought a 24 pack. After just a month, I ordered another box! This is a great product and much cheaper than buying at the grocery store check-out line.<br /><br />March Update: Good news! While it's true that the Mars Bar *was* discontinued, it was relaunched in January 2010 and is initially being sold on an exclusive basis through Walmart. I just bought one today for the first time in nearly 10 years! Even so, I am now quite used to Snicker's Almond and I like them both!

review/summary: A Good Candy Bar to Keep On Hand
review/text: Out of all the candy bars, I think that the Snickers with Almonds is the best one to keep on hand at the house.<br /><br />I find that it is lighter but also feels a bit more like "real food" than the peanut Snickers.  To me, it has a more sophisticated balance of flavors that maybe you might say is a bit more "adult", whereas peanut Snickers are a bit more appealing to kids perhaps.<br /><br />I also find that this candy bar has more of a buttery hint, and a preferable balance of textures.  It also seems to hold together much better, without turning gooey like peanut Snickers do.  Actually it seems to me that, overall, the quality of the ingredients is higher than in the peanut version; for example, the chocolate seems to be of better quality.  But it may just be the overall balance makes it seem that way.<br /><br />These keep well in the refrigerator and make a nice simple snack.

review/summary: NOT the actual pink himalayan salt!!
review/text: Great price but once I tasted it I realised why it's such a great price. Because it is not the real super fantastic pink salt that I have come to love. This salt has a very prounced aftertaste, the kind you find with cheap table salt.  I took this bag over to my sister who had the real pink salt.  Side by side we could see and defintely taste that this wasn't the real stuff.  We concluded that it must be a very small amount of pink salt added in for color and mixed with regular table and sea salt. Again, the aftertaste is very strong, something you NEVER taste with the genuine Himalayan pink salt- one of the many reasons people pay so much for it. And this defintely ISN'T it.<br /><br />(FYI- In San Francisco, Rainbow Grocery has it for a great price in the bulk section.  If I still lived there I wouldn't be trying to buy my pink salt online and ending up with this mess! :))

I drink this tea hot or cold and it never disappoints!  4 stars instead of 5 because they went to double packaging it in a pouch in the can & you get less (1.76oz for Mystic Mint compared to 2.9oz for Sweet Mint).  I would rather get more product and less packaging for the same price.

review/summary: Loved by my Persian!
review/text: My little female American Persian thinks that this version, along with the chicken version, needs to be the ONLY kind that Fancy Feast produces. However, my male English Persian sincerely has his nose up in the air over this one, totally has his knickers in a twist about it.  Actually howls if he ever finds it near him!  Yes, he's quite the character but normally loves Fancy Feast, along with many others Friskies distributes.  These do contain a higher level of protein than most cat foods which makes them great for a rescue cat like my female.  It helped build up her muscle mass (as well as her vocal chords!) and put the necessary weight on her tiny frame.  Great, great product, she goes completely mad for it, highly recommend!

review/summary: the best gluten free pizza crust available
review/text: Chebe pizza crust mix is the best gluten free pizza crust available, and I've tried them all.  To be honest, its so good I prefer it to regular wheat pizza crust.  This is one of the very few products out there that not only nicely replaces the wheat version, but actually supersedes it in taste, texture, and quality.  My children - neither of whom are celiac - request Chebe over regular pizza.

review/summary: New formula - not so great
review/text: Once upon a time, Chebe made the best pizza crust ever - great texture, thin and chewy, very tasty, even rolled out easily without sticking to pan or rolling pin.  Friends not on the gluten-free diet raved about it too.<br /><br />Not any more.  The formula used for the mix seems to have changed along with the instructions - making it easier to put together (no more baking the crust first, as we used to do, before adding toppings), but resulting in an inferior product.  It's lost the chewy texture and the great taste and is now just another over-priced GF mix - one package makes one medium-sized pizza.<br /><br />If you make it, oil your pizza pan (something that never used to be necessary) before putting the dough in it, or the pizza will stick.  And don't pile the toppings too high or add too much sauce, or the dough won't bake through in the middle.  If you're lucky, you'll get a fairly edible pizza - but you could make a good bigger pizza for less just using the pizza dough recipe in a good GF cookbook - e.g., Elizabeth Barbone's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1891105418">Easy Gluten-Free Baking</a>.  After all, you have to add oil, milk, cheese, and eggs to this Chebe mix - why not just mix up some dough from scratch and save yourself a lot of money?

review/summary: Great crust
review/text: Ok so the first few times I tried this product I had mixed feelings. After a few additional tries I figured out the best way to make the crust. First instead of the 2 tablespoons of oil you will use about 1/4 cup. Don't add it all at once. Instead use your fork to mix the crust and after it is ready to knead you will slowly add the oil till you get a gum like texture. Whatever you are using to cook it on (I use a pizza stone) oil it. When you put the dough on the spread (I do mine by hand) fold it over itself a few times to start it. Then you will move it to the edges. You will have extra dough a the edges but make sure that you get the inner areas as thin as possible. If you do not this will result in the dough not cooking all the way through. You can either remove some of the extra dough around the edges or leave it (I leave mine and I love it). If you leave it, it will rise and it will look like a 14 inch soup bowl or a giant hat. You can season the edges before you cook it for dipping in butter or save the crust for crutons. Im not gonna lie, it took me a few times to figure this out but this is the best result that I have gotten from it and it is GREAT.

review/text: We picked up a few bags of this pizza crust mix when our daughter was first diagnosed with Celiac disease 3 years ago.  The whole extended family  - including some really picky eaters all enjoyed this gluten free pizza.  However, it has been very difficult to find in our area (Maine).  We are very excited that Amazon now carries Chebe products!  They are very easy and quick to make - no mixer is required.  The packages are easy to travel with and the ingredients needed (egg, oil, parm cheese)are ones that most people have on hand.  The pizza crust mix also includes several other recipes on the back of the package (ie calzones, breadsticks, etc).  Thank you Chebe and Amazon!

review/summary: Our favorite GF Pizza dough
review/text: This is a staple in my kitchen, and we eat pizza usually once a week. This dough takes some getting used to, it has a lot of seasoning added to it, which covers up the "it's not real dough taste" but it tastes great. I have never tried to make this without eggs, but I make it using just water and eggs and oil and it usually turns out pretty good. This is one of those things to have on hand though, it's really easy to make and you can use it for a variety of different things. For our dairy free pizza, we loaded it with sauce, fresh veggies, and some pepperoni...pretty good!

review/summary: Awesome stuff if you're eating Primally
review/text: This isn't necessarily low-carb, but for primal/paleo folks and gluten free- folks, this is a winner. I make mine without cheese in the crust, as it is optional.<br /><br />It took me a few tries to get it right because I stink at cooking, and I learned the hard way that you should NOT broil this for too long. That aside, the recipe is very easy: Mix + 2 large eggs + Oil (I use EVOO), and some shredded cheese if you desire.<br /><br />Even though you could put the pizza toppings on at the same time that it cooks, I found that I liked it better by cooking it for half the time (it doesn't need long to cook), and then adding the toppings.<br /><br />The bread itself is a bit different at first, crunchy/firm on the outside, but soft and somewhat gooey (but not nasty at all) on the inside. It's really delicious even on its own.<br /><br />I would consume this in moderation but daily if you wanted; I had a pizza binge with one box and it went right through me. Daily eating is fine...maybe even multiple times a day...just not all at one go if you have the occasional binge.<br /><br />Great product, really helpful toward weight goals.

review/text: Amazing gluten free crust!  I had made this for a friend who also has celiac disease, making him the main pizza and me a little mini one, (just big enough for one pepperoni) to try just in case it tasted like so many gluten free mixes-awful-but this tastes like 'real' pizza-if I didn't have self control, poor guy would never have had a pizza to eat!!!  It was delicious, and had a delightful rise and acted like normal wheat dough-I could roll it out and not get sticky.  I am now a maniac for manioc (ha ha!), but truly, a wonderful mix-I went out and tried all the chebe mixes-they're affordable and delicious.  (I've only been gluten free for a few months-not long enough to have forgotten what 'normal' food tastes like and still haven't learned to settle for anything less than the taste and texture I remember from my yummy gluten-filled days.  Well, thanks to the Lord for creating manioc, and to Chebe for  boxing it up for me, I don't have to settle!!!<br />Try this-you won't be disappointed!  Then go buy the cinnamon rolls for desert or breakfast the next morning-again, yum!!!

I opened the package and was overwhelmed by the smell of vinegar.  Vinegar is not listed as an ingredient but that was what I smelled.  There was no sign of the oregano that was listed as an ingredient.  I cooked it so long that the cheese was burnt but the crust still was not browned.  It didn't rise at all and eating it was like chewing rubber.  Chebe wasn't the best rising product out there, but the taste always made up for it - now that's gone I won't be back.

review/summary: Best Pizza Crust, and it's Gluten Free
review/text: This mix makes an excellent gluten free pizza dough. I tried several other brands before, but their mixes came out like a batter that you level on a baking sheet and comes out cake like.  Chebe pizza mix is nothing like that. When mixed, it actually forms a dough ball the you can roll out with a rolling pin or work flat with your hands. It is gently seasoned, enough to give it an Italian flavor, but not over powering. When it is baked, the pizza crust has a slight chew to it like regular pizza dough. You can cut your pizza like normal and actually pick it up with your hands without it falling apart. I ordered it by the case based on the other excellent reviews that it got, and I don't regret it one bit. My husband and kids do not have to eat gluten free but they even like the pizza crust. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ACMCNA">Chebe Bread Pizza Crust Mix, 7.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 8)</a>

review/summary: Great!
review/text: I have found the pizza crust to satisfy my craving for pizza.  I have not been diagnosed with a sensitivity to gluten, but found that I seem to feel better after staying away from it, so decided to just go gluten-free.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the Chebe pizza mix was so good.  I have tried using the mix for rolls and I love that too, so I am definitely a believer in the Chebe products.

review/summary: Really great gluten free option
review/text: Only 2 of the 5 members of my family have celiac disease, but everyone really enjoys this mix! It's easy to make and I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor and texture. It's not your typical pizza crust, but they add herbs to give it a great flavor. I've made the pizza and calzone with this mix and the crust was nice and crisp on the outside and a little chewy on the inside. I've tried a few really horrible gluten free pizza crusts and was about to give up before I discovered this one. My kids actually fight over the last piece of pizza when I make it. :-)

review/summary: Great thin crust pizza
review/text: I have been making homemade pizza for years and my family prefers homemade.  Finding a satisfactory gluten-free substitute was difficult.  We really like the chebe pizza crust.  In fact, my daughter (who does not need to eat gluten-free) likes it even better than my regular crust.  It makes an excellent thin crust pizza.

review/text: It is very easy to use -- mix one package with 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons of oil and 4 tablespoons of milk or other liquid, then use a rolling pin to shape it. I used parchment paper on top of my cast iron grill pan to make the pizza. The crust was nice and crisp. If I didn't know I was eating flourless crust, you could have fooled me! I'm looking forward to using this dough for calzones and bread sticks that they mention on the back of the package. So happy I found this!

review/summary: Care about your health? Run away screaming!
review/text: This is the kind of garbage "food" that gives paleo/primal a bad name.<br /><br />Whenever you see the words "Gluten-Free" on a product label, you should immediately be skeptical.  99% of the time you'll want to run away SCREAMING at the top of your lungs.  'Cause it's not only about gluten, it's about blood sugar spikes.  If you care about your pancreas (which you can't live without), and not becoming (or staying) diabetic, you should care about this.<br /><br />Look at the ingredient list:<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Manioc (Tapioca) Flour, Modified Manioc Starch (100% Manioc), Iodine-free Sea Salt, Basil, Garlic, Onion, Oregano. Manufactured In A Gluten-free Environment. Allergen Information: Contains No Wheat, No Soy, No Corn, No Rice, No Potato, No Yeast, No Nuts, No Peanuts, No Lactose, No Casein.<br /><br />Those first two ingredients are garbage carbs you don't want to eat no matter what.  Tapioca starch will spike your insulin faster than a Snickers bar... faster, even, than two slices of whole wheat bread.  No need to investigate further.<br /><br />But say you're still curious. Let's go to the Chebe website.  Here's where the real tale is told:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The box contains 10 servings, at 18 grams each - HOWEVER, you use THE ENTIRE BOX to make one pizza crust!  That's 180 grams of pure, processed carbs with zero nutritional value in one 14" pizza crust, which is only a medium size pie.  The other ingredients you add to the crust mix are negligible carb-wise (but you still look at them): 2 eggs=1 gram, 1 cup shredded cheese=0 grams if you grate it yourself from hard, aged cheese (the pre-grated store cheeses are coated with potato starch and do add some carbs), 1/4 whole milk=2.5 grams, oil=0 grams. So 3-ish grams are added to the pie.  And now let's say you top it with tomato sauce, part-skim mozzarella and some veggies (since a pizza isn't just a crust).  Even without calculating precisely how much you're using, it's a good bet that you are adding another 30 or so carb grams.  Thus, your medium pizza pie will have 180+3+30 grams of carbs, or 213 total.  You eat half the pie, that's 106+ grams of carbs.  If you're trying to lose weight, that's more than two DAYS worth of carbs.  If you're trying to keep your blood sugar stable, you just blew that, too.<br /><br />To lose weight eating grain-free, the rule of thumb is no more than about 50 carb grams per day, no more than about 15 net carbs (carbohydrate-fiber=net carb grams) per sitting.<br /><br />And that's how you evaluate a "Gluten-Free" label.  Or, you could buy the product, make it, test your fasting sugar with a glucometer right before eating, then again an hour later to see firsthand what it's doing to you.  The average healthy, non-diabetic person will zoom from about 90 to 160 within an hour; then it will take another several hours after that to get back down to around 100.  Do that once a day (or several times per day) for a few years, and your problems will be over - because then you can start injecting insulin into your belly with a syringe before each meal and eat whatever you want!  And once again, the "food" industry and Big Pharma win.  To me, that's just sad, and the antithesis of paleo/primal eating.<br /><br />I love pizza.  I eat it all the time.  AND I eat a low-carb/high-fat diet.  In a few months, my triglycerides went from 261 to 87, and I'm no longer pre-diabetic.  That never would've happened if I were preparing meals using commercial mixes like this.  There are dozens of reputable low-carb, grain-free recipe blogs and websites out there with pizza crusts made from cheese, eggs, flax meal, nut flours, cauliflower, or even just sausage (Meatz Pizza) that are just as easy to make as this one from a processed mix, that hew to the spirit of paleo/primal eating and are far healthier to boot.

review/summary: Excellent Pizza Dough
review/text: We have been creating GF pizza at home now for several years thanks to Chebe.  You have to be fairly accurate with your measurements or it is a challenge to correct and oversight.  It is best to thoroughly cook the dough on both sides before you add your toppings.  The consistency is great because it has allowed us to add any additional spices that we choose to the dough.  Out of the various GF doughs that we have tried, this is the only Brand that consistently delivers a quality mix

review/text: We have found that if we don't put in the optional 1 cup of cheese the crust is crisper.  We roll the dough as thin as we can (if it sticks to the counter we rub a little olive oil on the counter) and then put it in the oven for 5 minutes before adding the toppings.  Then add the toppings and put the completed pizza in the oven for 15 minutes.  Chebe bread makes great pizza crust!

review/summary: Pretty Good Quick Pizza Dough Option
review/text: If you need to quickly put together a gluten free pizza dough crust this stuff is pretty good.  You can assemble everything right before making the pizza - no need for yeast or letting the dough rise, and you don't need to worry about defrosting anything.  That being said, I still prefer the taste of homemade gluten free dough with yeast- however that takes more planning and prep time.  For busy moms with a gluten free household, I'd say it's a great staple to have around the kitchen.

review/summary: Tasty Chebe pizza mix
review/text: Chebe pizza mix is one of the best gluten-free mixes we have tried. The spices are very well done.  Be sure to spread the crust thin, otherwise it can be a little gummy.  We always pre-bake the crust before adding toppings and finishing off the baking process.  Because Amazon offers free shipping, it was far more economical to order from them rather than the gluten-free dealer we usually use.

review/summary: Better than expected
review/text: I have been considering going gluten free, due to health concerns and as I am reading the book "Wheat Belly."  I purchased this mix to play around with the gluten free thing.  I was rather impressed with the end result, except for one main thing - the instructions say to NOT oil the pan, and as I figured when even the dough stuck to the pan, I was unable to get my pizza off the pan without a big mess.  I did notice that it was a bit easier after it had cooled a bit.  I would think that perhaps some corn starch on the cooking pan may have helped this, but I am not much of a cook and the instructions make no mention of any additional steps.  I also only managed to cook the pizza for about 10 of the 15 minimum minutes, as the cheese was starting to get too brown.  I did however enjoy the taste, which I consider to be quite acceptable as a pizza lover.  It's not a replica of your favorite pizza joint, but for instance I think this wins hands down over the pillsbury refrigerated dough mix!  An added bonus:  I haven't had to sprint to the bathroom after eating it!  I would like more information about the modified tapioca ingredient, and I notice Chebe gives some explanation on its website, but I find it a bit confusing.

review/summary: Good gluten free crust
review/text: My SO and I love this crust.  When making it looks like it is not going to become dough like because so little liquid is used.  However just keep kneading and it will come together.  The first time  we made it, it did have a slight after taste but only two or three bites in the whole pizza.  So we used a recipe posted in the review about using 3/4 a cup of olive oil drizzled in slowly while kneading and the dough came out a almost the same as before but no after taste this time.

review/text: Before I discovered this product I had all but given up on pizza.  The only way I got good pizza is if I went to a local place that actually made gluten free pizzas... but they were also sadly around $15 for a personal pan sized one.  Since I have discovered this I have pizza again!  Chebe uses tapioca flour as their main flour ingredient and it is flour I highly prefer.  It creates a chewy crust that can also be thinned out and baked crisp.  I have also used this mix rolled out really thin to create crackers.  It works really well for that, as most gluten free ready made crackers I have found have a strange texture and/or are tasteless.

review/text: I have been searching for the *perfect* pizza crust.  Ther perfect gluten free one doesn't exist, but this is pretty good.  I liked that there were seasonings in the dough.  I used my bread machine set on dough only cycle to mix it.  I added two extra tablespoons of water before it seemed right.  I liked that I could knead this dough until it was smooth and elastic (only took a couple of minutes.)  Rolled it out with a rolling pin (another nice surprise) so I felt I had some control over the crust.  I can see how it would work well for bread sticks.  I baked it per the instructions with lots of sauce and cheeses.  Yummy!

review/text: I've had a terrible time finding gluten-free pizza, even in a big city. This Chebe mix allows me to make my own. Because I don't have a rolling pin, I made my crust thicker than was recommended on the package, but I actually like the slightly chewy texture! So many gluten-free doughs have the wrong texture (too brittle or dry). Because Chebe uses tapioca flour this crust has real give--tastes great too. Highly recommended.

review/text: While the flavor of this dough is good, I've made it four times, for different ways, and the resulting texture isn't at all what its creators say it should be.  For that reason I can't imagine it performing well as a pizza crust.  As a flatbread, it's fine.  Regardless of how much liquid I put in the dough, the edges dry easily, like a cracker, but the middle in some cases was still doughy.  So, if you just want a tasty gluten-free treat, it's great.  But it doesn't perform as its intended.

review/text: This is the best gluten free pizza mix I've dealt with.  My kids think it tastes great so it's nice that we can actually eat pizza again.  The dough mixes up and rolls out easily.  I also don't have problems with it sticking to the rolling pin or pan like some of the other mixes I've used. It's best to follow the instructions exactly the first time, then adjust accordingly.  I made the mistake of baking the crust early in the day, then adding toppings in the evening.  It was like eating pizza on a cracker!  I also find I have to add a lot more milk than the mix recommends to get the dough to stick into a ball shape, so don't be surprised.  Also, when reheating it turns out much better to bake for 10 minutes in the oven than to microwave your leftovers.
