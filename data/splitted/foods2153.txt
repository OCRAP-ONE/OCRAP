review/summary: Thrilled with results
review/text: As a breeder and exhibitor of Great Danes, I am thrilled with the results I am seeing with adding the carrots and beets to my dogs food. I am seeing shinier, softer coats, and the 2 that I have with some skin irritation have improved as well in just 2 weeks. Stools are also firmer and my picky eaters love the carrots. With traveling alot and being around many different dogs I am happy that the products also help boost their immune system.  So many benefits of adding just a couple Tablespoons a day.

review/summary: Great for all breeds!
review/text: I have 2 dogs of my own that I use to feed dry food only.  A friend of mine recommended adding in Olewo supplements to my dog's food. I hadn't really heard of supplements for pets but I did a little research and liked what I found. My dogs love to carrot supplements in their food! I have a smaller dog who is a picky eater and would refuse food sometime. After adding in the carrots to her food she went crazy and finished every bite. I am also feeding my dogs the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083QBWKU">Olewo Dehydrated Red Beets Dog Food Supplement, 2.2-Pound</a>. If you are going to try the carrots, get to red beets too!

review/summary: Works - if you take it consistently
review/text: I've been taking a scoop of this every morning for about 3 weeks now. The first 10 days or so, I didn't feel any different, but now I do. More energy, can hit the weights harder, and it feels like my libido got a boost. The key is to take it consistently. This could be a problem for some people, because it tastes like sheet. I mix it with water & force it down, but for the people with less masochistic tendencies you might want to look into capping it. It works, though.

review/text: We are heavy coffee drinkers and love to try different types all the time. I was hopeful that this would be great quality and we were turned off by the strong, heavy flavor with almost a musty tone to it. Perhaps it was old, I didn't see any date on the bag. We will finish it and with enough creamer in it we can tolerate it but wont purchase again.

review/text: I fell in love with Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee (where else?) in Jamaica! I love the rich, deep aroma and the smooth non-acid taste. This is one of the only coffees that doesn't irritate my stomach. Yes, it's expensive but well worth the treat. I tend to give this as a gift to friends and family and it's become so popular that I even get requests for it by name! I buy it in both ground and whole bean.

review/summary: Surprise! Great coffee, great value!
review/text: To my mind, "Blue Mountain" and "Blend" just didn't go together. But the price was certainly lower than what I'd expect to pay for the real thing. Feeling flush or maybe just lucky I ordered some. Wonderful! It has the well-rounded flavor and complete absense of bite that I look for in Blue Mountain. It's appropriately light, and with just a hint of the sweetness that in my opinion defines the best of Jamaica. Very, very worthwhile experiment. Until I can make it back to the Island, this will do just fine.

This coffee has absolutely no flavor. I would give it zero stars if I could.

review/summary: My cats hate it
review/text: I was looking for a less expensive alternative to Weruva and decided to give this a try based on the good reviews.  Sadly, the quality of this isn't anywhere even close to Weruva - this comes with a few identifiable flakes of fish on top; the rest looks like dark fish guts (including gut contents), grainy and clearly unpalatable as my kitties refuse to touch it, even when fed nothing else.  I gave it to a friend I visited over Xmas to try with her cats, but they also rejected it. She is planning to donate it to her local shelter; I hate waste, but think it might be better if she just tossed this.  Bottom line, I cannot recommend the Natural Value and will keep away from this brand in the future.

I buy nearly all of the 5.5 oz Natural Value cat foods and this past Monday showed all the labels to my vet. He said it is a great food and my cats, both in for checkups, look wonderful.  One is eleven and the other is seven and they are totally indoor RV cats, beautiful coats, bright eyes, perfect weight.  Their teeth are also in beautiful shape, meaning no expensive cleaning bills.

review/text: I tried this because it was more natural than some other brands. My cat vomited when she ate it, and I know cats just vomit sometimes, so I dealt with it and kept feeding it to her. Each time I fed it to her she vomited. When I gave her other food like dry food or other canned wet food, she was fine. Then I gave this to her again, and she vomited. Not sure what's wrong with it, but we tried. Sorry, won't order again.

review/summary: They do eat it, finally
review/text: I tried Natural Value chunk mackerel, and my cats refused. I thought this one might work out, and they do eat it eventually. It is hard to find a relatively pure product with a minimum of dangerous additives. Am still working to win them over, but may have to switch to solid tuna, which they do like. At least they don't get sick on this, as they did on the chunky mackerel. Having been owned by cats for many years, however, I know my chances. This is a good product ... minimal additives, simple presentation, and simple ingredients. They do enjoy the tuna with crab, shrimp or albacore. Wish I could be so fussy.

review/summary: This flavor is horrible and you can't return it!
review/text: I've bought other flavors (cinnamon raisin and cinnamon) of Jacobsen's snack toast in the past (from a grocery store) and loved them.  I have year old twins and I give them the snack toast to help with teething and as a treat.  The cinnamon and cinnamon raisin flavors are all natural and taste great.  This blueberry flavor is NOT all natural.  The blueberry flavored bits are made up of: sugar, corn syrup, corn cereal, modified food starch, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, artificial flavors, and artificial colors.  Not only are the ingredients bad, the toast itself tastes bad - like a cheap blueberry flavored kids cereal or something.  Not appealing at all.  Since I couldn't see the ingredients list before buying, I now have 6 boxes of blueberry snack toast that can't be returned and will be fed to the birds (hope they like it!).  Wanted to warn anyone else considering this flavor to get the cinnamon or cinnamon raisin instead!

I got a sick stomach just from taking tiny tastes off of a couple chips.  I hope everyone else has better luck.

review/text: The malt vinegar gives it a slight and I mean slight sweetness to the vinegar taste.  These are amazing.  Crunchy, thick, just the right amount of sea salt.  Better than regular salt and vinegar chips.  Actually most of the Boulder Chips are truly gourmet and tasty.

review/text: Despite not liking a lot of salt, I have an occasional craving for chips and salt & vinegar is a favorite variety. These are the best of the bunch, period. As a previous reviewer has noted, the use of malt vinegar gilds the lily that happens to be an already excellent chip--thick, crunchy, golden, and just salty enough. Pucker up and enjoy (but try not to become addicted).

review/summary: Best potato chips I've ever had!
review/text: After trying many different types of thick potato chips, this is one of the best.<br /><br />Other brands of 'kettle' chips usually has a lot of dark discolored chips.  I'm not sure if that is from overcooking or using poor quality potatoes.  An example of that is a certain popular name brand that has the word 'kettle' in it.  In contrast, Boulder Canyon's Totally Natural potato chips are usually bright yellow throughout with consistent potato flavor.<br /><br />The only issue I've ever had is sometimes you get a rancid batch.  When this happens, it usually affects the entire batch (with the same batch number).  Because of those previous experiences, I now sample one bag.  If it tastes normal, I'll usually collect the entire stock (that has the same batch number).  It's kind of funny when a few customers start staring at my shopping cart full of potato chips at the checkout counter.<br /><br />If buying online, please buy from vendor with decent customer service, such as Amazon.<br /><br />I have purchased these from Whole Foods Markets and Fry's Electronics in the past.  WFM probably does not stock them anymore.<br /><br />Some close alternatives (in case you can't find Boulder Canyon):<br />Lay's Kettle Cooked Original<br />Fresh & Easy's Kettle Cooked Original Salted<br /><br />I have purchased well over 100 bags of these Boulder Canyon Totally Natural for my family's consumption.  They are definitely a family favorite!

review/summary: Subtle
review/text: If you want a lot of "pow!" in the way of salt and vinegar....this is not your bag of chips.  By that I mean that the malt vinegar flavor is fairly subtle.  It has a slight sweetness like you'd figure from malt vinegar.  The chips are nice and crispy, however smallish, which is fine for a small bag as such.  Overall...good flavor, salty enough, slightly tangy/sweet.  I shall very much enjoy the remainder of the case I bought, but may try a case of something else in seek of something with a little more bang.  Having said that, I appreciate that they use real malt vinegar solids and sea salt. Unlike some "kettle type chips" that use cheap acid variants that simulate the salt and vinegar flavor, but leave your mouth and tongue feeling like you swabbed your mouth out with sandpaper.<br />If you like Salt and Vinegar chips, they are certainly worth a try to see if they fit your taste.

review/text: The malt vinegar flavor is a nice change from typical vinegar chips, but it's unfortunately overpowered by the salt. My husband tried these and agreed they were too salty. We did enjoy the chips and had no trouble finishing an entire 10 oz bag, but I wish they'd cut the salt a bit. It's just unnecessary and really detracts from the vinegar flavor.

review/summary: Salt & Cracked Pepper Canyon Cut.  OMG The Best Chips I've Ever Had By Far. Delecious
review/text: These chips are/were Delicious, I wish I had ordered more while they were on sale. These chips are similar to ruffles but better seasoning. the salt is just right and the robust pepper gives it a "umph" that tantalizes your toungue but not spicy hot. These have a built-in overindulgence system, too much and the pepper becomes overbearing thus limiting your intake. I tripped the system many times.<br /><br />Only complaint is my chips were all broken up, I really do like a whole chip rather than scraps in bottom. they were like that in many bags. If Boulder can't fix that maybe they should package in cannisters like pringles.<br /><br />But taste is SOOOO Good, You won't regret ordering these. I would say these are for adults rather than kids due to sophisticated seasonings.<br /><br />Seems like this flavor is discontinued or out of stock. Sea salt & cracked pepper may be similar.

review/text: I've been a fan of kettle chips for over 20 years--and have always remained loyal to the original Kettle brand.  I've sampled many other brands but never found one I liked as well.<br /><br />Well, now I've found a new favorite.  Boulder Canyon kettle chips are even better than the original!  They're very crisp & crunchy, with a delicious taste, and best of all, they have a lighter touch on the oil as well as the salt. And, there are no overcooked chips.  The only way they could be better is if they were made from organic potatoes.<br /><br />Try them; you'll like them!

Boulder does make good kettle chips and I'm pretty sure it's just the canyon cut that sucks so bad.

review/text: Admittedly it has been a while since I've had an actual Nestle Lion Bar, but what I remember is that it is almost exactly the same as a Cadbury Mr. Big bar which is available in North America, except the Lion Bar is about 2/3 the size, and doesn't have peanuts.<br /><br />Here's how Wiki describes the Mr. Big bar: The standard bar is made of a long, layered vanilla wafer, coated in caramel, peanuts and rice crisps, which is then covered in the chocolate coating.<br /><br />Here's how Wiki describes a Lion Bar: It consists of a wafer, caramel and crisped rice covered in milk chocolate.<br /><br />I like both, but I can get Mr. Big for about 1/4 of the cost. There's not much difference between the two in terms of taste and appearance, in fact I can remember being fairly disappointed when I got one in England, I'd made a point of only getting candies I couldn't get at home, ones I remembered from childhood in England before emigrating.<br /><br />Oh and Nestle who make the Lion Bar, also make the ice cream version of the Mr. Big bar.<br /><br />So the bar itself gets a 5, but buying it at import prices, that gets a 2, since there is a much cheaper almost identical local product available.

I hadn't had Lance crackers in years but I knew I liked the plain ones that restaurants often kept on the table. Absolutely love Cream Cheese and Chive, it's my new favorite and PB & Honey is also good, just a sweeter version of the classic. However the other two flavors, while they sounded appealing, were really revolting. I recently found out Lance has discontinued Smokehouse Cheddar and replaced it with Four Cheese which I have yet to try. Don't know if they will start showing up in this variety pack. Grilled Cheese tasted nothing like grilled cheese. I am happy I found Cream Cheese and will be buying that in the 8 pack. Won't bother with buying the variety pack again.

review/summary: Great price.  Yummy mango.
review/text: I am a big fan of Philippines Brand dried mangoes.  Just received my order today.  Came in its original box.  (see pic)  No problem with the taste.  I am eating my first bag and it tastes great as usual.  Expiration date is in March 2013.  Nice and fresh.  Would recommend.  I usually buy a big bag from Costco and with the lower price here at Amazon; I prefer these smaller bags.  For less than $1 a bag; you cannot go wrong!  Yeah!  Yum!

review/text: I bought this tea for my wife, who LOVES the Black Currant tea at Jason's Deli.<br /><br />This has the same aroma and flavor, and it brought a smile to her face when we shared some last night.<br /><br />Thanks to SerendipiTea. This is EXACTLY what we wanted!

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: I bought this tea after purchasing the same blend at our local tea store, so had the opportunity to compare the two side by side.  Here's my take:  Before brewing, my local tea store's Cassis/Black Currant clearly had significantly more flavor, smelled fresher, and had much longer tea leaves than did the SerendipiTea brand.  It also seemed to smell like it also had more "notes" and was a more complex and aromatic blend than the one from SerendipiTea, which by contrast looked and smelled a little faded and stale.  After brewing, the SerendipiTea was more bitter and dark in color (more intense).  In the future I will pay more for the local one because it is so much better.  Probably comes out to another dime per glass of tea, but for me that is well worth it.  The  SerendipiTea is cheaper, it does make a reasonably good tea, but the other is simply more enjoyable to drink, much more mellow and far less bitter.

review/summary: A decent treat.
review/text: You might be surprised to know that dogs are genetically quite similar to humans, and therefore a lot of the things that are good for us, are also good for them (bar things like grapes and garlic). When we saw that these Blue Buffalo treats had banana and yoghurt in them, we decided to give them a try.<br /><br />PROS<br />- No corn, wheat or soy<br />- Added flax seed fish oil for Omega 3 and fatty acids<br />- Banana, Yoghurt and Carrots are all excellent for dogs<br />- Cane molasses instead of the sugars and corn syrups others use<br />- No meat/poultry content (Very unlikely to EVER be recalled)<br /><br />CONS<br />- With shipping these are too expensive, I would suggest going local to be perfectly honest<br /><br />Our pup loves these, and while they don't drive her nuts like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W8KL2I">Blue Buffalo Chicken Bites</a> do, she is perfectly content to munch on these whenever they are offered. They are healthful, nutritious and when purchased locally a pretty dang good deal considering how much better they are then other brands! Definitely recommended!

review/text: We have a 4oz Elite kettle popcorn maker and love to use this seasoning to make sweet/salty kettle corn. Just heat up the oil in the kettle, pour 1-2 tablespoons of this excellent flavoring into the bottom of the measuring cup, then fill with popcorn kernels. When the oil is hot add the corn and seasoning to the pot. Out pops delicious crispy kettlecorn! We wish this flavor came in a giant size!!

review/text: All of us love these Sweet Stripes peppermints.  They do not have a strong peppermint flavor and are really sweet - so they are perfect if you want just a little something.  They are soft - not hard candy - so you usually end up chewing them.  If you crave something sweet now and then this works great for not so many calories/carbs.

They were so popular that I bought three tubs of these during the holiday season.  Everyone who came in the door had some, and took some with them, the packages I sent out of town had a bagful as a special surprise, and a friend who especially enjoyed them got a whole tubful as a little gift.  I, and my sweet tooth, recommend these most highly!

review/text: My orignal review was:  Before i purchase, i would love to know the ingredients. specifically, i am wanting to avoid anything with high fructose corn syrup. thanks!  Eventually, I did get an email back from the maker listing the ingredients. I was pleased to find they are made with sugar, not HFCS.  It would be nice to list this on the product description as it makes it a higher quality product IMO. My fav restaurant gives them away, so I have not yet purchased them. My favorite way to use them is to drop one or two in a cup of freshly-roasted expresso-strength, french-press coffee. Provides just a hint of mint and just-right sweetness.

review/summary: Bobs Sweet Stripes Soft Peppermint Balls & what else?
review/text: I was a big fan of these soft peppermint balls for at least 15 years or more.  I had them at home, at work and in my purse and in the car glove compartment.  However, I no longer purchase these candies.  They used to be made in the USA, in Georgia, just a few years ago I learned they are now made in MEXICO!  This information is on the back of the package in very small print.<br /><br />A little research revealed that Bobs company was taken over in 2005 by Farley's & Sathers Candy company.  Their web site shows at this time they have 2 plants in Mexico.<br /><br />I have major concerns about the quality of any food item made in Mexico and will not purchase any such food once I can identify the point of origin -- like Green Giant Brussels Sprouts are now grown and packed in Mexico.  For shame on the American companies and their greed for more profit at the expense of American consumers.<br /><br />The Good News is that there is still a wonderful soft peppermint ball made in the USA:  Red Bird Brand, made by the Piedmont Candy Co in Lexington, North Carolina.  Made in the USA since 1890!!  Reasonable priced and totally delicious.  "Nuff said"

review/text: I'm wondering whether they forgot to put the peppermint oil in this batch. It's just soft, sugar candy with the faintest hint of peppermint. I've used Bob's peppermint sticks for several years for my favorite peppermint pie and never been disappointed before.<br /><br />Well, I made the pie according to Paula Deen's recipe, but after mixing the "peppermint" balls with the other ingredients there is not a hint of peppermint.  Wish I could exchange the balls for sticks just to see if there is a difference.<br /><br />I sure don't recommend these for peppermint lovers.

review/summary: I know it has some questionable ingredients, but this is the only thing that fixed my dog's rash.
review/text: My 4yo Dalmatian mix was suffering with an awful red scaly rash on his belly, and after trying many, many other foods, topical creams and lifestyle changes with no success, I tried this food in a "what the heck, it can't hurt" mood.  Within a few days his rash was nearly gone, with no new spots.  I thought it was a coincidence, since it's clear from the ingredients that this is really just the standard mega-factory meat-byproduct diet in fancy packaging.  Then we tried his other food again because I had the flu and just could not get to the store that sells Chef Michael's, and within 24 hours he had new red raw spots.  So, back to Chef Michael's for us!  I know the dog food review sites trash this stuff, but I'm not quite sure what's so terrible about meat byproducts and soybeans anyway (my dog would eat out of the cat's litter box if I let him), and it's working for my dog.  Plus, he LOVES it, can't get enough.<br /><br />*Update, Feb 2011* I noticed that my dog seemed hungry all the time on this food.  I think the high percentage of soy protein, while not a negative necessarily, is just not ideal for dogs and doesn't fill them up like meat.  So I fed him a bit more than I had of the other foods, and he ended up packing on some pounds.  I know, dogs beg and act hungry all the time, but he really, truly was hungry!  So I'm now trying foods with a higher meat content, but considering coming back to Chef Michael's and supplementing with some ground beef or turkey or eggs cooked at home.  I still think this food is a good option and a good value, and would recommend it.
