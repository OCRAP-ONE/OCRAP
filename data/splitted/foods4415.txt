I am sorry for the money I paid, and will not order any Candy Depot products again.  Thirty three and a half dollars, completely wasted.  I'll try flowers next time!

review/summary: Just because you like rooibos and lavender doesn't mean you'll like this
review/text: I love rooibos and I love lavender, but somehow the combination in this tea has created the most vile tea I have ever tasted. I've never had a tea that I thought was so gross that I actually had trouble drinking it except for one that had stevia in it. I don't like the taste stevia sweetened things have and it seems like this tea has that same taste. I was so sure I'd love this tea, I'm glad I didn't buy it here first (I almost did), I only have to figure out what to do with one canister instead of six.

review/summary: First Herbal Tea I've ever liked
review/text: I kept hearing great things about Rooibos tea, but couldn't find it ANYWHERE. I went to Nature's Market in a local Kroger and the only two teas they had with Rooibos was Red Lavender and Fireside. There was no straight Rooibos and this particular tea was on sale. I picked up one tin, thinking I wouldn't waste much money if I didn't like it. I brewed the first cup and thought it smelled more like perfume than tea. Moderately turned off by this, I bravely took a sip of the stuff - no sweetener or cream (as I usually add to my teas). I was amazed. I fell in love with the stuff and chugged it - despite it being moderately warm. I've also let it sit and drank it when it was cooler and still loved it. Then, I added sweetener and cream and suddenly it was a tasty dessert tea. I threw in half a pack of sweet n low one morning and made a replacement for my coffee.<br /><br />I'm not sure what it is about this stuff, but I love it. It has a very unique flavor that's difficult to describe. It's a very smooth, slightly bold flavor with a somewhat sweet aftertaste.<br /><br />I plan on trying their fireside, next - but not before I try adding some cinnamon directly to my Red Lavender tea, first.

review/summary: some of the best herbal tea ever!
review/text: I love this tea, and drink it hot or cold. There's an almost sweet note to it, the rooibos tea provides some perceived sweetness. The lavender is perfect- it's there, but not too perfumey.<br />A coworker and I discovered our shared love for this tea, and we bought a 6 pack, thinking we could give some as gifts and have a stash for a while. We were right.<br />It's nice to know I won't run out of this tea for another year. If there's an earthquake or other natural disaster, I'll flavor my bottled water with it and pretend I'm fancy.

Then I had to buy a case of it because I knew I'd be drinking it a lot ;)  At first I was the only one in my family drinking it, but now my husband and kids are drinking it up too.  It has such a full, rich, beautiful flavor.  We add some stevia (calorie free herbal sweetner)to it and it is perfect.  Now I want to try more of the Gypsy herbal teas.

It has a lovely flavor of Lavender that is not too over powering. Nice on a hot day. Great hot after a long day at work to unwind. Tin is really nice too. I tend to save them for things like thumb tacks.<br /><br />Great that it is Fair Trade.

review/text: Bought these for Valentine's Day for my wife. By the time Proflower added on all of their special handling charges and services charges this was an $82 bouquet of flowers and $50 worth of delivery charges. What we received was half a dozen frozen baby white carnations and a pile of baby's breath, absolutly no other flowers or colors. It looked like a bundle of weeds. Aditionally, the cheap vase they charged $19 for as a premium, was broken off at the top and there were no fragments in the box. The vase was packed in that condition. I buy flowers all of the time on line and by phone and I have to say that Pro Flowers is the worst company of its type I have had the misfortune buying from.

review/summary: Interesting taste at first, but now I like it. Perfect for the holiday time, after dinner and dessert.
review/text: This Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark chocolate has 3 component to it which makes it taste very interesting as you take a bite at it. Chocolate layer (available in milk or dark or 60% dark), white chocolate layer, and peppermint crust.  It's kind of unorthodox to use peppermint (or replace mint) with chocolate (as you might be tired of the peppermint candy cane), but they didn't put too much peppermint crust so it is good. but enough to give the kick of the mint taste (and mintier than the regular mint chocolate)<br /><br />If you like mint or peppermint, there is a good chance that you will like this peppermint bark chocolate (maybe not at the first bite). This is perfect for the holiday time, after dinner and dessert.<br /><br />I like the Dark Chocolate version compare to the Milk chocolate version because the white chocolate layer is already milky and sweet, as well as the peppermint crust, so the dark chocolate will give more balance and reduce the overall sweetness of this chocolate<br /><br />If you like this chocolate, you might want to try the after eight mint chocolate which is also very good. You might also want to try (if you haven't already) the Ghirardelli Mint Chocolate (Dark Chocolate with white mint filling). It's really good.

review/summary: No middle ground - you either love it, or you hate it!
review/text: As a Brit, brought up on Marmite as soon as I was weaned, being away from it in the US has been torture.  Cold nights with hot toast and Marmite, or breakfasts with it are the stuff memories are made of. Bread "Soldiers" with Marmite when you're ill, and Marmite and Peanut Butter sandwiches are the foods an empire was built on!<br /><br />If you're trying to get an American to appreciate it, make sure they know it is savory and salty before they try it.  My wife nearly threw up when trying it because she was expecting something like Nutella!  I was so impressed when my local Safeway stocked it in the tiny English section of the "Foreign Foods" aisle, only to find it had gone again two months later.  Obviously not enough demand in California, although I hear it has become a sought-after delicacy in New York.  Now we just need a few New Yorkers to spread the word (and the Marmite!).<br /><br />As the ad campaign in the UK said, you either love it or you hate it......

review/text: You either love Marmite or you don't. If you are reading this then you probably love it. There has always been the problem of what to do with the spoon that was used to remove some product from the jar. These squeezable bottles with the valve in the cap allow you to dispense the exact quantity desired without dribbles or long strings of Marmite. They are a great solution to an age old problem.<br /><br />When the bottle is almost empty air blows out the cap valve. Loosen the cap and put the bottle in a microwave cap up for 7 seconds. That warms the contents enough to reduce it's viscosity and you can squirt the last drops of warm liquid out. I will be buying these jars from now on.

These tubes work out roughly the same price per gram as buying the small jars locally. The free shipping and convenience of delivery made this a good deal. A lot less waste using the tubes, and no more scraping a knife around the inside of a jar.<br />They actually shipped direct from the UK, so question about whether this was going to be some different version made specifically for the US palette.<br />I ordered 10 of these, and the expiration date was a little under 8 years, I do not expect they will last more than 8 weeks.

review/summary: My dog will do anything for a beggin strip
review/text: First off, there are a couple reviews that complain about the content of these treats- lets look at these as what they are- treats... they aren't food- they aren't intended to replace the nutritional value of food.  It is like giving candy to your children- it isn't good for them and usually has no nutritional value, but you give it to your kids as a special treat- something to enjoy.<br /><br />Now that I have that out of the way, lets get down to these strips.  My dog loves these and I can rip each into smaller pieces since she is a smaller dog who doesn't need 6 inch treats all at once.  I have also found that these work well for sticking into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8">Kong Classic Kong Dog Toy, Large, Red</a>.  break off a piece, cram it in the kong, and give it to the dog.  It is a bit harder to get out than the kong stuffing that sometimes falls out.  I have been really happy with these treats, and my dog goes nuts for the taste!

review/summary: Classic Bacon Treat
review/text: I used to buy these treats for my Cocker Spaniel years ago, and with a new chocolate Lab, it was time again to purchase these.  I found a great deal on Amazon and went with the 6 oz packages.  These are the perfect size so that nothing dries out from the time you open the package to the time you're dog is finished with the bag.<br /><br />Break into small pieces to treat for good behavior or to help ease into crate training.  Great for clicker training, too.

review/summary: Dog said 5 star I say 4
review/text: My dog loves these but he will swallow them whole or try to.  I have to break them up to give it to him. I like using them mixed with other treats for puppy class. They do smell bad (to me) but he likes it and works hard for them. I also mix them because he cannot have too many of them a day because they give him gas that will clear a room. It also makes his breath smell for a short time.

It is a little cheaper than buying them at the store which is 25 miles away.  This way we get them delivered directly to our house and don't have to make a special trip just for dog treats.

review/text: bob's had two dogs who specifically ask for this treat!  bob can attest - the package is easy to open and the treats smell good.  i can tell you that both dogs (that's 100%, n = 2) have gone crazy for these treats.  the pricing is comparable to those at that big chain store.  these are an excellent treat for the loved and maybe slightly spoiled dog!  bob recommends this for all dogs.  he usually gives products that he review a grade, but since he hasn't eaten these he feels that he shouldn't.  if he ever does eat one, you'll be the first to see his published grade!  in the meantime, i (his doggy) give this a grade of A+++++!!!!<br /><br />YUM!!!  Again!!!  bob still gets this wonderful treat for me.  i'd rather eat these than dog food.  i'd do anything for these treats, even sit and shake.  bob says the price is right!

review/text: My sister and I are both chihuahuas, and we really love these strips. Since our mouths are small, Daddy breaks them into pieces before giving them to us, but that just makes them last longer.<br /><br />I learned to do a lot of things in order to get these, I know how to sit, and how to come, and how to go out on the patio when Mommy and Daddy want to go someplace without me. They are my super duper favorite all time dog treat. Well, except for cheese. I can smell cheese a mile or two away.<br /><br />But if it has to be just for dogs, you can trust it from this chihuahua, these are awesome!

review/summary: Can you go wrong with bacon?
review/text: There's not much to say here except that the dogs LOVE Beggin' Strips. They act very put out when we give them lesser treats ("Milk Bones"? They put their noses up at it). I don't see much difference between the with cheese and without cheese varieties and the dogs don't seem to care. This particular unit is two 25-ounce bags and we find that one bag lasts us approximately two to three weeks. We have two dogs and we give them treats, probably, two to four times a day depending on who's around. This is a cheaper way to get them than Wal-Mart.

review/text: I bought these several months ago at our local Sam's Club when I saw them on display.  They were eaten very quickly and by the time I made it back to Sam's to purchase more they didn't have them anymore.  I checked the companies website, but it only lists product information/history of the company. :( While on their site however, I did see that they make many different flavors of the chocolate thins!  I searched for these a few months back here on Amazon, but unfortunately they were all out of stock and it stated "they weren't sure when they would be available again.  I am so happy to have found them on here now.<br /><br />The shape of the chocolate thin is like that of the Pringle potato chip.  Very sophisticated way to get your chocolate fix.  The Belgian Chocolate Thins are just way too delicious to eat just one (or two...or three... or four...)!!  Wonderful product!  My only complaints are that they are a bit pricey and I also wish the products were sold in local stores.

review/text: I have been on this journey to find healthy alternative(s)for quite some time.  I was reading in a book about flushing the fat and this was the only substitute recommended; so I went to whole foods the next day hoping that they carried the product "stevia plus".  Although, the label did not specify that it was the "plus" version - I took a chance to purchase it.  Now, I'm so glad that I did.  I'm very impressed by it's flavor.  I had tried a few other stevia products but the taste was unbearable.  This is my first review, so I hope someone can appreciate this recommendation.

review/text: After a lot of trial and error I have decided that Stevia is the best substitute sugar product for me.  SweetLeaf is a good product because the Stevia is still in the powder form, not changed to a granulated form. Reading about stevia I found out that the basic powder or liquid form is better for your health and I find the taste just as good.<br />In our house we use SweetLeaf for coffee and tea, of course, but also cereal, oatmeal, fruit desserts and plain yogurt.  We have not missed regular table sugar.

review/summary: Only one I use
review/text: I've been using Sweetleaf Sweetener for more years than I care to mention. They've perfected Stevia a great deal since the early days when I would dip a toothpick into the bottle and still use too much. It's still easy to use too much, and I've gotten pretty good at judging when a whole packet is called for or whether to sprinkle out less into my drink or whatever.<br /><br />I grow Stevia, just because I grow herbs, and it's a nice plant to have, but I've not been successful at drying the leaves for my own use. Even when I grind them in the coffee grinder, the powder just floats on top of my drink.<br /><br />There are controversies over the use of Stevia, just as there are over everything from eggs to green tea. I just know I can't use the artificial sweeteners like aspartame as they immediately give me migraines, as does anything sweetened with corn syrup. I sweeten with Agave Nectar, Stevia, local honey, and occasionally organic raw cane sugar. These work for me. Mostly it's just a matter of trial and error to find what works for each individual, but I would vouch for Sweetleaf Sweetener, and I try never to run out of it.

review/text: This is a great sweetenr. Pleasant flavor, just enough sweet to satisfy. I will say, though, that prior to lessening the sugar in my daily intake, this wouldn't have been enough, and it would have tasted bitter. I tried Stevia a year ago, and I couldn't take the bitterness. But now that I use very little sugar, this is perfect. I use NO other fake sweeteners of any kind, and add only real honey and maple syrup to my baking.

review/summary: Does ALL stevia have a bitter aftertaste?
review/text: I bought this at my local health food store some time ago because it was on sale.<br />After tasting it, I understand why it was 50% off.<br />Ugh!<br />It has a somewhat bitter aftertaste which you can avoid by just using less. Of course "using less" would defeat the purpose of using a sweetener in the first place, wouldn't it?.<br />This stuff also made me gaseous.<br />I will, however, use up the box because I must admit, this is not the worst stevia I've ever tasted. Some stevias I've tried were so nasty, I HAD to throw them away.<br />At this point, I've not found a stevia that actually tastes like sugar.<br />My search (for a sugar replacement) continues!<br /><br />Edit: 9-18-12<br />I've been using this product for about a month, but recently started using it on a regular basis, thus my review above.  I just discovered something which may interest those of you reading this review.  This product contains "inulin", which is a soluble fiber.  How convenient is that?  Fiber in a sweetner!<br />:>)<br />Edit: 9-21-12<br />I am upgrading this product from 3 stars to 5.  I'm using MORE Sweet Leaf instead of less to get the sugary flavor I love.  Once you get used to the aftertaste (which is NOT as bitter as others), this is actually a great stevia.<br />I will repurchase.

review/text: I love the product. I was on a low carbohydrate, no sugar diet. Stevia Sweet Leaf was indicated to substitute for sugars. I love it, and I am still using it, even after finishing my diet plan. The product s good but the saving on amazon.com, goes away on shipping and handling fees. I was able to find the product at same price at a grocery store.

review/summary: Tastes okay, but doesn't dissolve.
review/text: Compared to other Stevia/RebA extracts, the flavor of this is pretty standard. It's not bitter, and cooks okay.<br /><br />Except these are single-drink packets, so you wouldn't cook with them.  I would use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0094HB8V0">Truvia Baking Blend</a>in bulk for cooking.<br /><br />The filler in these greatly increases the time required to dissolve/mix it with drinks, especially if the drink is not hot. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1KA">NOW Foods Stevia Extract Packets</a> dissolve much better and taste just as good.

review/summary: Clumps
review/text: I got this as a substitute for the Truvia packets I had in the past.  This product is a fine powder unlike the Truvia, which is granular.  The Sweetleaf clumps in the bottom of my iced coffee even though I was stirring it rather well.  I was getting chunks of it up in my straw and it has a very bitter taste.  I tried it a few times in my iced coffee before I went back to my Truvia.  I do not think I would buy this again since it does not serve my needs.

review/text: I decided to switch to green tea instead of drinking soda every day. I knew I would miss the sweetness of sugar, so I picked this up to add to my tea. It really does taste well, but is not super strong. One packet in one cup of tea does the job. I guess this is healthier, so I would pick some up.

review/text: These pickles contain so much sugar I was convinced they were bread and butter pickles until I carefully re-read the description.  According to the label, there is more sugar than vinegar, in fact more sugar than anything else but cucumbers.  Nevertheless I did enjoy them, but I'm not sure I'll order them again.<br /><br />As a connoisseur of hot foods (especially pickled ones), I found them hot enough to have a definite and lingering bite, though not hot enough to make my eyes tear.  I'd probably call them a medium on a Texas scale, beyond hot on the New England scale.

review/summary: Sounds good enough to eat!
review/text: With the recent problem of some dry cat foods containing a potentially life-threatening substance, I decided I simply wasn't going to take a chance. I was already feeding my cat some of the top quality dry foods, including one of Hill's Prescription Diet varieties that you can only get at a vet's office; however, I wanted to move him up to a good natural dry food as well. He loves fish so I tried the California Natural Herring & Sweet Potato dry food, which I got in their small size just in case it wound up being squirrel food to his picky taste buds. He loves it!

review/summary: Great for cats with allergies to normal protein sources
review/text: We have a beautiful five year old Abyssinian with an unfortunate tendency to vomit fairly often. We had gone through food after food, trying different protein sources (as well as grain free foods) and finally figured out that it seems he's allergic to all poultry. Some protein sources were better than others (he did better with duck vs. chicken or turkey), but nothing seemed to completely take care of the problem - until we tried California Natural's Herring and Sweet Potato. After two weeks of this cat food, he hasn't vomited at all. Our cat's coat is glossier than it has ever been. Some reactions to previous foods were so severe that he would also lick bald patches in his coat, often on his tummy. That behavior has stopped as well. After researching many foods, this one seems to be the best and has excellent reviews as a healthy dry food for cats. I'm thrilled to have finally found a healthy food our kitty loves.

review/summary: Stay away from this Food, can cause urinary problems
review/text: I fed this to my cats (I have 33) and I started having MAJOR problems with urinary infections and blockages from crystals with several male and female cats. I traced it back to the food and found that 1) fish is bad news for cats because of the high mineral content and 2)on top of that Sweet Potatoes are also really bad as they contain a high level of oxalates. People who have bladder and kidney problems due to stones are advised not to eat sweet potatoes so I am going to assume that that is true for cats. Sweet potatoes and herring are not foods a cat would eat in the wild anyway. Bottom line stay away from this food, urinary blockages are serious and your cat can die within 48 hours without expensive intervention (like thousands of dollars expensive). Since I switched foods 6 months ago I haven't had the problem again.

review/summary: California Natural Herring and Sweet Potatoe Cat Food
review/text: My Mom's kitty came down with Granuloma on her chin. After trying soap and meds the vet gave her a cortizone injection. The Granuloma disappeared for approx 3 month and then came back. She was given another injection and she stopped eating which because she was chubby affected her liver. We were able to turn it around but no more injections for her. I searched online and found that Omega 3's help skin problems. We switched her over to California Natural's Herring and Sweet Potatoe dry cat food and the granuloma disappeared! She has now been months and months with no more outbreak! She has thinned down (which is good) ..... don't know if it's because she's not crazy about the food or???? She needs to stay on it bacause of the granuloma.

review/text: I had some problems with my delivery but I won't dwell on them here because Amazon promptly remedied them.  The bottom line is that this salmon tastes very good.  It has a nice, dark red color and mild flavor.  Yes, as other reviewers have noted, it has bones in it.  From a nutritional standpoint, the bones in canned salmon (and sardines) are one of the best reasons to eat it, especially if you don't eat a lot of dairy.  The bones are a fantastic source of calcium, and the canning preparation makes them soft and edible.  I will be reordering these regularly.

Well, it turns out that these are absolutely great!  They're very much like original Oreos.  I'm so happy and my daughter, who is also GF was happy to be able to come home tonight and dip cookies in milk, "just like the commercials".  When I gave her one she said, "these are like the ones on tv.  For me?  Are they gluten free?  Yay!"  She's three and was very happy to have a fun treat.  She asked if I'd send one to school with her in her lunch so she can eat what the other kids are eating.<br /><br />Pick these up, for sure.  You won't be disappointed.

review/text: I've been gluten free for about 10 years now and didn't have time to order my usual Schar Vanilla Sandwich Creams prior to a camping trip.  These Kinnitoos were unattractive and crumbly which is no big deal but, to me, they tasted like thick communion wafers with thin, grainy icing.  Sort of mealy and way to sweet.  If you weren't crazy about these, you might try the Schar cookies.  I like pretty everything from them.

review/summary: Not bad for gluten free
review/text: It is a truth universally acknowledged that foods for special diets can be absolutely abysmal.  Since going gluten free, I have probably had most of the worst packaged food in existence.  Happily that is not the case with these cookies.  On the plus side, they have a very good taste, and taste very similar to Oreos, which was a real plus as far as I was concerned. The one negative for me was that the package I bought had some very hard cookies. I don't know if that is typical, or if it was just sheer bad luck on my part.  The taste can't be beat, but the texture was not a favorite of mine. I broke the remainder up in a food processor to use as a crust for a cheesecake, and the crust turned out to be almost impossible to chew, so I don't recommend using them for that.  If you want a good tasting cookie that holds up well to dunking in milk or coffee, this may be your lucky day! A pretty tasty all around cookie, but with my sensitive teeth, I won't be buying them again. In general, this is a good product line and I do buy their products all the time.

review/text: My son is intolerant to both gluten and dairy, so these cookies are a real find. Finding substitutes for name-brand products when you are GF-DF is always a challenge. Oreos were a normal part of our life before. The Kinnitoos are the only GF-DF sandwich cookies we have found that are even remotely close to the taste and texture of Oreos. Personally, I think they are better than the real thing. I never like the "fake" taste of Oreos...
