review/summary: Quite a jolt
review/text: It made me realize I do have limits with caffeine. I drink my coffee black and I had to water this one down to be able to drink it at all. I would have given only one star, b/c I don't like it personally, but gave it three b/c I recognize that what I hate about it is exactly what some will love about it! So, all the coffee lovers, , this is for you! Medium guys and gals, not so much. Interestingly, I do not disagree with the positive reviews -- this is a really strong coffee! Emirils coffee, as one reviewer said! Or, a slap in the face, as another one said! This is just too strong for me. I thought I liked strong coffee until I tasted this one.

review/summary: Bold Isn't Always Better
review/text: Emeril's "Big Easy Bold - Big Easy Intense" Gourmet Coffee is anything BUT easy.  This thick, pitch black coffee mounts an EXTEMELY rich attack on one's palette quickly followed by a bitter, gagging, complex finish of earthy flavors.  This stuff tastes like that tar-sludge coffee in Monsters, Inc. looks!  Beyond the shock and awe of the cutting, intense attack on one's senses, the coffee blends an unpleasant mix of flavors that may induce nausea.  Unless you can drop shots of 100-proof vodka as if they were Jello shots, this is NOT your coffee.

review/summary: Love the coffee but not the new higher Amazon prices
review/text: Love this coffee. However, now that Amazon has substantially raised, by 25-30% the prices across the board and subscribe and save has been removed I have found, at least temporarily, a cheaper place to buy. If you have a Bed Bath and Beyond near and get the 20% off coupons you can buy three 18 box cartons and save about $5. Cost me with tax about $25 and I got 6 extra cups vs the 48 box offered here. Just a suggestion. There may be other places as well.<br /><br />I do enjoy buying from Amazon and hope, maybe after the holidays? that the prices will become competitive again.

review/summary: Only Strong Cup Out There
review/text: I tried about 20 different cups before settling on this surprise contender. I hated to buy a celebrity-endorsed product but this was the only one that didn't taste watered down. I was testing the other cups at 7.5 oz of H2O but with Emeril's I can run it at 9.5 oz and be happy. True, it has more body than flavor, but unlike Emeril himself (or me a 45 year old tech ops loser), this coffee has a REALLY nice body. If you're looking for thick and rich, this is it. I've tried other Timothy's coffees (Emeril doesn't roast/grind "his" own, of course), and have found them sub par. I may rethink the Timothy's line now. There is a French Roast offering from Emeril/Timothy's now. I just ordered a box. Hope it's as good as the Big Easy.

review/summary: Maybe too bold...
review/text: We've tried many K-cup flavors in our house and this one quickly became the one you had to drink when we were out of everything else.  Finished the last one this morning and can safely say we'll stick with other tried and true flavors (like Tully's Kona Blend, Caribou or Gloria Jean's Cappucino).  Definite bitter taste and aftertaste, takes a ton of flavored creamer to make it palatable.  My wife went as far as to describe the flavor as what burnt tires would taste like.  Wish I'd read the other review about one k-cup being good for 2 cups of coffee--might have meant less creamer!

review/summary: Tried to like it...
review/text: Not one person in my household who has tried this, has enjoyed it.  I bought some of this for my dad and i thought he would love this because he likes a really bold cup of coffee but he hated it.  I have to had it to him though... he tried to like it for my sake.  He tried it several times before he was honest and said he truly hated it.  My mother, who likes her coffee on the weak side tried to water it down but she said she almost spit it back out into the sink when she took the first sip (wish i had been there to see it).<br /><br />I tried it knowing it wasn't really my type because my dad honestly didn't like it and that made me curious.  Also i tend to believe with the appropriate amount of milk and sugar any coffee can be decent right?  Well i didn't finish the cup even after the extensive doctoring i did.  It was burnt tasting and very bitter.  I'm very surprised there are so many good reviews for this one.  The only use i could think of for it is if you are on a long drive down the highway at night... it would be good to keep you awake.  Not only will the caffeine help but the terrible taste in your mouth.

review/summary: Bold? Not!
review/text: I bought Emeril's K-cups based on the reviews here. I love strong, bold coffee but Emeril's goes way over the top. There is a difference between bold and bitter and this coffee is just plain bitter and it is one of the worst coffees I have ever had. I got a Keurig B60 after my coffee maker broke and saw a Keurig in one of the lounges at work. I was taken in by its convenience and bought one and am the sorriest person I ever did. I have sampled all the Keurig K-cups and cannot find one to my liking. They are either too weak and watery no matter what size cup you make or just plain bitter which leaves an aftertaste. In addition,if you like stronger coffee, you need to make the smallest size cup, 5.5 oz. which in this day and age is ridiculous; people drink out of large mugs and you can drink that 5.5 oz in 3 or 4 gulps! I am getting rid of the darn thing and going back to brewing my own. There is a reason that the majority of the nation's premium coffee roasters have NOT jumped on the Keurig bandwagon. It does not make an excellent cup of joe.

review/text: This Extra Bold, Dark Roast K-Cup is great for those who like the convenience of using a K-Cup, but prefer a richer, more bold flavor to coffee. If you're like me, and tend to find most K-Cup coffee weak and reminiscent of vending machine coffee, you might like this. Its flavor and strength do not seem to require using only the smallest cup size, but seem good to the medium mug size. It is similar to Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond, Tully's French Roast, and Black Tiger (among a few others).

Full bodied, with just the right amount of sweetness  and an indescribable  rich  aftertaste, I have not experienced ever before.  This replaces my previous favorite Green Mountain Dark Magic. The surprise with Emeril's coffee is, it is always the same consistency with every cup. In my opinion,this is the best coffee you can purchase for the Keurig.In my opinion, this coffee is so perfect it deserves to be called,The "KING OF COFFEE until something better comes along.That may be impossible.

review/summary: A real coffee drinker's coffee
review/text: I consider this the best k-cup coffee out there for real coffee drinkers.  At least for those who want a nice bold cup of coffee like Starbucks used to have before they went to the all McDonald's like "Pike's Place Roast" all day policy. The boldest and most flavorful of all K-cups. This is great coffee. I brew two K-cups to fill up my cup first at the smallest cup and the second at the middle cup and it is still nice and bold, tastes great. In the afternoon I brew two at the smallest cup size.

review/summary: How Could You Be So Bold
review/text: After FINALLY purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">the best coffee maker</a> I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a "to each his or her own" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the "Midnight Magic" brand; I've tried the "Jet Fuel" brand; I've tried the "Donut Shop" brand; I've tried all of the "Extra Bolds"; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!

review/summary: Differentiate Between Bold and Bitter
review/text: Some reviews here call this coffee "Bitter" - well all I have to say to them is: "Clean your pot" - if you can't handle a strong cup of coffee, go buy a latte and let people who like REAL coffee define - coffee - not a non-carbonated soft drink that you want so badly.<br /><br />Of all the K-Cups, this is by far the best coffee around. It is bold, strong, and keeps you wanting more. This is why its the best selling K-Cup around. I suggest that you shop wisely online for these, and buy in quantity, this is what I do - I get usually 12 24-Pack boxes. Me and my wife drink this daily - it truly is a great tasting coffee - without any of that ridiculous flavoring that some on here want - if you drink this you better wear pants - otherwise stay in your skirt and drink some Sanka!

If you drink Coffee, you really should get a subscription.<br /><br />On to the coffee. I'm pretty picky about coffee, this one I quite like. It's got character without being bitter, a bit of kick without being obnoxious. I would definitely pit it against a good coffee shop, and at the subscription price, it's a steal.

review/summary: the real bold coffee
review/text: I've chosen many bolds from the Amazon offers here as well as other on line shops. I always felt there left something more to be desired in each one I tried. This is the problem with the K-cup b/c the amount of coffee is limited, and when I am feeling like I want something stronger, which is often, I can't just put more in the hopper like I used to with the old machine. I often add another K cup after the first into teh same big cup. Also, often when I'd get to work I'd make another.<br /><br />I've had Emeril's Big Easy for a month now, and rarely have I felt like I needed to double the cups, or needed more when I get to work.<br /><br />I think that says it all.

Another reviewer mentioned Newman's Own Extra Bold, which is also good, but for me, Emeril's wins without contest.

review/summary: Wonderful on it's own or mixed in drinks
review/text: This is the finest Cola I have found yet.<br /><br />There is a small store near me who sells it by the bottle.<br /><br />For cola drinkers, this is significantly better than Coke, Pepsi, etc., but the real treat is when you use this in place of Coke in drinks. (for those of you of legal drinking age)<br /><br />It's not just the quality of the liquor that makes a good rum & cola, Captain & cola, bourbon & cola, etc., it's the quality of the COLA that makes a good drink SOOO much better.<br /><br />Fore those of you mixing, use a high quality liquot with this high quality cola.<br /><br />I recommend Captain Morgan Reserve, Myers Dark Rum, Jim Beam Black, Maker's Mark, etc.

review/summary: No High Fructose Corn Syrup!
review/text: Not only does this soda taste great, but it is sweetened NATURALLY.  High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) is in practically everything these days, and it is one of the worse things we can consume.<br /><br />I discovered recently that being AmerAsian I am an easier target for Type 2 Diabetes and HFCS is a huge contributor towards that condition because it is an extremely refined sweetner.  Therefore, I've done my best to stop buying products containing HFCS.  When it comes to fruit juices, this is pretty easy.  However, I have been a Coke consumer for many years.  Boylan's CaneCola is the only cola I've tasted that actually tastes like a soda, but doesn't contain HFCS.  I have tried one other brand called Cricket.  While that is good, you can tell it is made with tea.  Boyan is better!  And I think it is even better than Coke!

review/summary: Great Cola! better at lower prices
review/text: An organic food store near my house used to carry it. Maybe Coke or Pepsi knocked it off the block because they still carry the other "fruit" flavored varietals. Cane Cola is my favorite, and this one is stand out. It's absolutely what I envision original spirits to taste like. Too bad, I don't see myself paying more than $3 for each 12 oz bottle. That's far more than a case of beer, what's going on here?

review/text: Remember Coca Cola from the early '60s? I doesn't taste like that anymore, does it? Have you switched to Pepsi because it isn't as sickly sweet as Coke? Well, make way for Boylans. This is so fresh tasting and satisfying the desire for real cola. It must be the cane sugar, which doesn't overpower the true cola flavor. The Diet isn't as good, but it's miles above Diet Coke. This stuff isn't easily available and sometimes hard to find, but it's well worth the effort.

review/summary: Fabulous Cola
review/text: I've been enjoying this cola for about 2 years. I will never again buy the run-of-the-mill Supermarket deadly duo.  crapAcola or Puksi!  The taste of Boylan's 100 year old vintage cola, cannot be described, but it sure can be enjoyed.  I used to frequently like RC (Royal Crown Cola) which is a bit better the the two aforementioned deadly duo sold everywhere.  Then I got turned on to Boylan's and forgot about going out on search expeditions for RC.  HFC is no good for you and Boylen's actually tastes better served NOT freezing cold, with 7 ice cubes deluting the taste.  1 good sized cube is AAA perfection.  This cola is EVEN Kosher!  Everyone knows that Kosher means "clean", in the sence of the word PURE.<br />No Aluminum can that you cannot close and no sitting on the shelf for 7 months in a plastic bottle, absorbing the oils used to make that plastic bottle, either.  A nice slender thick glass bottle, as soda was sold when product meant MORE than price, back in the forties & fifties!<br />Damn good stuff !

review/text: Hugh Hefner drinks Pepsi, which is a big point in its favor.  But...<br /><br />I don't care what anti-conspiracy data I get, I remain convinced that "Coke Classic" does not taste like Coke did before "New Coke" had its ignominious reign.  I've never liked "Coke Classic."  It just was never the same.  Pre-New Coke was an unmatched ambrosia.  Until now.  Boylan Cane Cola really tastes very, very close to the way I remember Pre-New Coke being.  It has bite, an edge of berry, and manages to be full-bodied without becoming heavy.  Too many "small batch" sodas have fancy bottles containing average sodas, no better than the supermarket brands.  This is not one of those sodas.  It belongs in the realm of Orangina, Vernor's, and Thomas Kemper Root Beer.  I don't think I can reasonably be expected to diet as long as this remains on the market.  I'm nutty for the stuff!

review/summary: The Best Cola I have had since the mid 70's
review/text: This is the best Cola bar none.  No HFCS and proper carbonation rather than being over carbonated with the intent of adding it to a glass full of ice.  This Cola can be served a bit warmer and without ice as it has a great taste.  But I fear that many of you have been conditioned to the artificial ingredients of the main stay cola's; well, your loss.  Unfortunately the price for this cola through Amazon is very high when compared to other sources.  Given that American consumers typically choose price as a deciding factor rather than quality I bet that relatively few sales have been made through this medium.  Anyway this cola is more than worth a try, it's the only cola I drink but I buy it for a fraction of the cost charged here...

review/summary: Boylan drinks are wonderful!
review/text: I refuse to drink anything with high fructose corn syrup in it, and I hate the nasty taste of every artificial sweetener. That leaves sugared drinks, preferably with attention to reduced levels of sugar. You won't find much of a choice in your local grocery store, at least partly because stores make financial deals with carbonated drink manufacturers. Boylan, of which cola and root beer are my favorite flavors, is one of the more available brands -- but even Whole Foods has dropped it in favor of another brand I won't mention here (and don't care for). If you like "Mexican Coke," give Boylan a try, I think it has superior taste. It is a really good thing that Boylan drinks are available with free shipping since a 12-pack weighs a lot; some vendors on Amazon charge over $30 for shipping a 12-pack. Take care to figure out the actual total cost of the product plus shipping. Lastly I'll note that on the web, Boylan drinks are usually more expensive than in the stores if you can find a local store that has it.

review/summary: Only thing that keeps my partner awake at night!
review/text: My partner and my FAVORITE soda. The taste is smooth and magnificent, the caffeine from coffee gives a great pick-me-up without the crash of general market sodas, the ingredients are natural, it's a company with community values that I support, and I would much rather drink a soda made with cane sugar than one made with high-fructose corn syrup or aspartame. My partner falls asleep during movies constantly, even after drinking other sodas, energy drinks, teas, etc., so I was ecstatic the day I found out that Boylan's Cane Soda keeps him awake past 8:30pm! And on top of that, it wears off  in a few hours for him so he can go to sleep when he wants to without a problem. This is a great product and I HIGHLY recommend it.

I ordered some Boylan Cola and Red Rock cola online and liked these better than any cola I've had. I'm not going to drink any other cola except this and Red Rock.<br /><br />It is also good as they are a smaller company unaffected by corporate greed which makes them use cheaper ingredients.

review/summary: Everything a Cola should be
review/text: This is the best Cola I have ever tasted.  I first tried it when I decided to stop buying products with HFCS (as so many people mention about this awesome beverage).  But the fact that this cola is sweetened with Pure Cane Sugar isn't its only claim to fame.<br />The first time I drank Boylan's CaneCola, I thought it was sweeter than Coke.  Soon I realized it was just more flavorful and actually less sweet - I had been conditioned to equate sweetness with flavour.  It has a hint of cinnamon - a Mexican Vanilla type taste that I can't get enough of.  The carbonation level is just right, in my opinion.  I love a nice bite and this cola seems to have about as much as Coke does.  I can imagine Colas tasted like this in the early 1900s - its everything a Cola should be.<br />Boylan doesn't compromise on anything.  They only sell their products in glass bottles to preserve an authentic taste.  No metallic residue taste (not to mention aluminum leads to Alzheimer's) and no plastic petroleum taste.<br />I was a life long Coca-Cola fan, but after my first Boylan... I'm just sad I didn't discover it sooner.

review/text: This is simply put the best tasting cola I have ever tasted.  It is so much more flavorful than Coke or Pepsi.  By the way, did you know that the second 'p' in Pepsi is supposed to be silent when speaking the word?  Many people don't know that, yet I always order it properly even though I get puzzled looks and people "correcting" me.  The nerve.<br /><br />Back to Boylan CaneCola, as other have pointed out - and as the product name implies - this pop is sweetened with cane sugar and it makes a world of difference.  It may cost more - but it is worth it, at least once in awhile you cheapskates.

It had "white spots" along the side. (Please see photo uploaded for this item) - Those who are familiar with milk chocolate, when it sits for a long time it develops white spots and loses its flavor. This is exactly what happened to the box of chocolate that they sent me. There was no flavor at all coming from this chocolate. It had an expiration date of "08/2011" but it was clear that this chocolate had been sitting around for a very long time. I asked politely for an exchange, and they kept giving me paste + copy responses saying that they did not do any refunds or exchanges and kept referring me to their return policy. I kept going back and forth and they were just not willing to do anything to accommodate my problem with this chocolate. Their customer service on the phone was horrible, the gentleman was not empathetic at all. They even sent an e-mail stating "This is how Kinder Bueno is supposed to look, are you sure you've tried this candy before?" SO RUDE!!<br /><br />The main reason I'm writing this, is because I LOVE Kinder Bueno. When I first had this in Germany, I fell in love! It was the perfect mix between Kit Kat and Nutella. However this company has really ruined this treat for me.<br /><br />DO NOT PURCHASE FROM PARTHENON FOODS.
