review/summary: be careful...
review/text: It seemed like a good deal on a box of 24 so I ordered it. First bar out of the box was a mess. The wrapper was stuck to it. Then there was the issue of air pockets that were over an inch and a half long that should have had that bar rejected for being too light. Out of the 24 bars in the box,20 should have never made it out of the factory. I brought this to the attention of Amazon and they graciously made it right. I've since ordered from a different Amazon vendor and the product has been perfect. If these middleman candy companies want to sell rejects and seconds they need to say so upfront.  Thanks Amazon for putting the customer first.

review/summary: WONDERFUL RETRO CANDY TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE
review/text: I bought these for my husband, who was always<br />saying to me that he missed the candy he used<br />to get in the 70's, especially the Charleston<br />Chew candy bars.  Imagine his surprise when he<br />opened up a special gift from me with 24 new<br />Charleston Chew candy bars!  These are fresh<br />and have all the great taste they had back in<br />the old days.  Some things never change, and<br />I'm so glad about that!

review/summary: Best Whole Wheat Bread Ever
review/text: I've experimented with some whole wheat bread mixes for my new bread machine, and so far, this is not only the tastiest mix, but the only one that results in a loaf that is evenly shaped. Everyone in the house likes it, too, which is also a huge plus. Delivery is really fast -- I now buy it two cases at a time, which results in free shipping, and it still arrives within just a few days. What's not to like???

review/text: I just got a bread machine not long ago and wanted to get a pre-made mix so I could test it out and get the hang of it before trying any concoctions of my own. I wanted something simple and straightforward. This was a very good choice. You just add some oil and water, and it produces a pretty tasty and healthy loaf.<br /><br />It was slightly on the bland side, so I made some alterations for my second loaf. I added a bit of sugar and some flax seed, and the second loaf was awesome. I love it.<br /><br />I'm very happy with the purchase and would certainly recommend this product. It gives you a good starting point and you can alter it as you see fit.

review/summary: Excellent Bread Mix
review/text: This bread is delicious with a wonderful whole grain texture.  I bake it in a breadmaker.  Sometimes I bake it with nothing else added to the mix but my favorite way is to make a breakfast bread with it by adding chopped dried cherries, almonds, and pecans and finishing off with a good dash of cinnamon.  Either plain or mixed with fruit and nuts, this bread rises high and beautiful.  Your friends and family will love you for it...should you decide to share.

review/summary: Very nice bread
review/text: I made my first loaf of this bread today in my Zojurishi bread maker which makes a 2lb loaf but this mix was no problem as directed (it makes a 1.5lb loaf). The bread is moist with a nice firm but soft texture. My family wants me to try it with a bit of sweetness next time so I will do that and see if they like that change. They tend to prefer a honey wheat bread, though this mix does contain honey in the ingredient listing. I like the sunflower seeds in the dough, too, which add a nice nutty flavor and texture. I am looking forward to experimenting with this mix and trying the addition of flax and other items to customize to our preferences and boost nutrition even more. I have always been well pleased with Bob's Red Mill products and feel that they are well worth purchasing.

review/summary: Superb, rich tasting bread
review/text: This is the first time I have used this mix. It was wonderful especially warm right out of the oven after cooling a few minutes. The bread comes out rich and hearty with a rich deep brown color. The taste is superb. I  chose to use margarine instead of the oil when I mixed it to give it an extra rich taste, as I do for most bread mixes. It it fantastic bread and healthy too!! Try it, I think you will like it.By the way, I did not use a bread maker, I made it in the bowl the old fashioned way and let it rise in a slightly pre-warmed oven with the heat off. On the second rise after putting it in the bread pan I left it uncovered to rise in the oven/ I have found this is best, rather than covering it with plastic wrap which sticks to the bread dough. This way it does not and allows the bread to rise well.

review/summary: This side dish is really tasty!
review/text: Knorr Sides Plus Veggies, Butter Herb Rotini with Garden Vegetables, is so much tastier and so much better a side dish than the plain noodle side dishes sold under the plain 'Lipton label' of the same company.  There are pieces of carrots and green beans that add so much more to the flavor and texture of this carb loaded side dish.  It still has too much salt but the veggies seem to help negate that problem.  It's really quick and easy to prepare and very tasty.  From now on, I'll only buy the Knorr varieties with added veggies.  They are just so much better!  As a matter of fact, I'd like to tell Knorr that they need to add even more veggies to this product so that the high carbohydrate negative sugar consequences will be decreased making this a much healthier side dish for every one.

Beware, you will probably want more of this after you try it. You're other brand will not compare to this.

review/text: Had everything ready to make tuna salad, then opened my can of this expensive, imported tuna to see what it was about. I tasted this tuna, and I knew it was one of the best foods I had EVER tasted. To make it into tuna salad would defile the chunky, smooth tasting fish. I ate it plain, and threw some on a regular salad. I never do this with plain Jane tuna. My expensive, imported tuna transformed into an investment in a very special product.<br /><br />I used to wonder why Giada would use a canned tuna on her live cooking show, and now I know why. Only wish I had more of this tuna so I could experiment with some tuna, white beans, onions, salad, vinaigrette.... Oh, I'm sorry! I got carried away! This olive oil packed Spanish tuna is an indulgent treat!

review/text: When I choose coffee I usually go directly to a dark French Roast but I thought I'd like a little change of pace so I selected <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OP72O0">The Bean Coffee Company Mocha Java, Organic Whole Bean, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a> the last time I needed to buy coffee.  I'm so glad I did!  I now have a new favorite!  This mocha java coffee is so wonderful!<br /><br />First of all I love that it is organic.  Secondly, it is whole bean because I prefer to grind my own. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, its flavor is divine ~ it is a medium roast that has a full bodied depth; it is smooth and low acidic; and the chocolate "notes" are subtle.  All of this simply translates into a very satisfying and delicious cup of coffee.<br /><br />I should also say that the Amazon pricing is extraordinary and as soon as I post this review I am going to order some more!

Post-brew (via Aeropress) aroma also isn't that noticeable.  There was floating sediment during the stirring step of Aeropressing - a first ever for me (what's that floaty stuff?).  Taste isn't bad at all for a medium roast.  You shan't be disappointed.  Will I buy again?  No.  Even Target's Archer Farms brand (espresso dark roast) is more exciting than this.  But for an organic blend, this is among the best I have tried.

review/summary: Wasn't that impressed
review/text: I have only had this coffee twice now, but I'm not that impressed at the moment. I drink all of my coffee through the French Press method, so keep that in mind when reading my review.<br /><br />At roughly 9.60/lb I was expecting reasonably decent coffee. As anyone who drinks coffee knows, coffee has gotten pretty expensive over the last year or so. I judge all my coffee based primarily on taste as well as taste/cost. For a frame of reference, I love Peets coffee, but the cost is simply too much to make it worthwhile for me to enjoy drinking it all the time. Most of the Peets blends I enjoy cost roughly 14-15/lb.<br /><br />The description of the coffee states "medium roast, chocolate notes." I would say this coffee is most definately a medium roast - and it may even verge on being a medium light roast, at least the beans I got. In terms of chocolate notes, I haven't had a mocha-java style coffee in awhile, so I am not an expert on chocolate notes in coffee. But, I could not really taste any subtle chocolate notes in the coffee. Maybe it was the French Press method of preparation, I do not know.<br /><br />Overall, I have a hard time rating this coffee. For the price, I wanted it to be better than it is. But when I think about price again, for a "really good" I would have to pay 50% more than this price.<br /><br />I think if I could, I would give it like 3.5 or 3.8 stars.

review/summary: crappy coffee
review/text: I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but I wanted to save others the time and money.  This is crappy coffee; there is NO flavor.  It is almost as expensive as my usual mocha java blend from whole foods.  This stuff doesn't even stack up to folgers.  Have been adding extra coffee to try to compensate, but that doesn't help.  Whats worse, I can't even return this.  I could drink it, but I like to enjoy my coffee (not water with a hint of coffee flavoring).

review/text: This is the first time I've felt compelled to leave a review on Amazon.com.  I ordered this honey on a whim, while on the lookout for some decently priced wildflower honey.  This is a little pricey, but worth it.  I believe I bought it on sale for $8 a jar.  I can't say as there's anything particularly pumpkin-y about this honey, but it certainly has a wonderfully present flavor. Sweet certainly, but also a little spicy, a little woodsy.  It's worlds apart from your standard clover honey that's for sure.  I absolutely love it in the mornings on buttered toast.  I imagine that it would work wonders in any Middle Eastern or European pastry that involves honey.

review/summary: oo strong mint!
review/text: Mint mint mint! This is my review of how to love mint matcha!<br />First of all - they're both green! That helps with that feeling of "I'm drinking a strawberry flavoured drink but it's green instead of red! Ow my brain!"<br /><br />It freshens your breath! Don't do what I do and make your matcha way too strong - otherwise associations of swallowing mouth wash come to mind. Oops!<br /><br />It's classy! Think of cr&egrave;me de menthe. Okay cr&egrave;me de menthe way be a little old fashioned, but it still hits the spot when you sip from crystal glasses. Drink this matcha from a crystal bowl! Now you're fancy too!<br /><br />It's great for cookies! Peppermint shortbread is one of my favourite Christmas cookie flavours. Nobody will blink at a red and green cookie - so go for it!<br /><br />It's a perfect mixer! I know this is a strange and unorthodox review, but this is finally the part when I drink the matcha and love it! Chocolate mint my friends.  I mixed a healthy dose (1/2 tsp) of Belgium Chocolate matcha with a small amount (1/4 tsp) of mint matcha! The mint is quite strong, but after experimenting I've found this to be my favourite mix. For an extra treat I add the matcha right into warm milk and froth it up!<br /><br />It is delish and reminds me of an After Eight hot chocolate. If that's not a treat, I don't know what is!

review/summary: Great tea!
review/text: This was my first time ordering from Red Leaf Tea. Everything went very smoothly and my order arrived super fast.<br /><br />In the fall, I love the mint lattes offered at the coffee shops. When I stumbled upon this, it sounded too good to be true.  I could make a yummy mint matcha latte at home? That's unpossible!  But no, it's true. It took me a few attempts to get the proportions just right, but when I did, all I can say is mmmmm!  To turn it into a latte, I add vanilla soy milk after mixing the matcha with warm water.  The end result is very creamy and mint-y and one of the best teas I've had. I've also tried mixing in some cocoa powder to make a chocolate mint matcha latte, and that was very delicious too. I think I have a new fall obsession.<br /><br />Even though mint is more of a fall flavor for me, I think because the mint in this is so smooth, it would also taste great iced. If I have any left by spring, I'm definitely going to try it, and also buy some bubble gum flavored matcha to mix in with it.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all mint tea lovers!

review/summary: MmmmmmMINT!
review/text: MMmmmmmMINT Matcha is JUST what I needed to help round off my matcha supply!<br /><br />I love mint but need to be in the mood for it. Luckly for me that mood comes fairly often!<br /><br />Mint is eye opening, awakening, and also helps soothe a troubled tummy.<br /><br />We had some really good Japanese food last night at a great restaurant but all of us were having some tummy "issues" last evening after dinner. This mornings mint matcha is really helping to settle the tummy woes.<br /><br />When I opened my bag from Red Leaf Tea the aroma was striking! I instantly thought "ohhhh yessss this is IT". It had some slight resemblance to Spearmint gum, and while I do detect a slight peppermint flavor here I would have to say the mint used is mostly spearmint. For those who know their mints some really prefer one type of mint over another. Spearmint to me is sweeter than peppermint and there is less of a bite to it. Some may beg to differ since most people are used to peppermint candies but in its true form I find peppermint to have more bite, sharper than spearmint and spearmint more sweet naturally. Regardless of what type of mint you prefer I have to say this Mint Matcha from Red Leaf does in fact taste very natural!<br /><br />Yet at the same time it is an excellent mixer as well. Of course you will want to use a little less mint matcha in your blend along with another matcha but I choose to blend mint with mocha this morning. The mocha I used a full scoop and the mint just a half of a scoop. I can taste the mocha very well and the mint does not totally over power it.<br /><br />This mint does not in any way taste like mouth wash or toothpaste. It is quite enjoyable. I am so glad that I purchased this one and will absolutely keep this as a stash regular.<br /><br />Also I notice that the mocha base is providing a nice creamy backdrop to the mint matcha! Ohhhh I MUST try a french vanilla / mint blend as soon as possible - I am thinking "Grasshopper" flavored matcha here! Oh yeah!<br /><br />So all in all I could not be happier that I went for it and grabbed this Mint Matcha from Red Leaf!

review/summary: A Shamrock whatnow?
review/text: Ah mint. My wife and I both adore mint, but I'm a spearmint girl, where she's a peppermint lover. And these are two very different mints.<br /><br />But I have love in my heart for mint teas. My childhood summers were fueled by Lipton tea bags with fresh mint set out on the porch to brew in the sun. Picking mint and just chewing on it as we played in the sun. Heck, my college days were fueled by mint juleps and raspberry mojitos. Mint and I are good, good friends. And a Shamrock Shake is a must-have for me every March! At least, it was until I found out about my dairy allergy.<br /><br />Which is what brought me to this tea, Mint Matcha, a desire to make my own version of the Shamrock Shake (which is essentially a vanilla-mint milkshake from McDonalds) with vanilla and mint matchas and soy milk or ice cream. But for the sake of this review, I'm drinking this matcha the way I drink all my tea, no milk and some sugar.<br /><br />Earlier today I made a cup of this for a friend of my wife's, who I am eagerly trying to seduce to the ways of matcha with my Red Leaf Tea collection,  and I fell in love the second I opened the package. It smells like a smooth creamy mint. When I commented on how good it smells, my wife agreed with me...and she doesn't even like matcha! I can't wait to have a cup of this myself!<br /><br />My wife's friend (who needs to be on Steepster, darn it!) says this tea tastes like Christmas (which may have something to do with the Rudolph travel mug I sent it to her in!). This made me think of my favorite tea of all time, Santa's Secret, which is a vanilla-mint black tea, so I have high hopes for this one.<br /><br />Holy mint, batman! This is definitely a peppermint tea, with just a hint of the smoothness that reminds me of spearmint tea. Wow. I am definitely craving a raspberry-mint matcha mojito now. Yum, yum, yum. It's mega minty in a non medicinal way and now I am dying to try it with the vanilla, but if I have any more matcha today, I'm going to explode XD. I love it! The burst of strong mint really helps wake you up too, and can definitely see myself adding this to my collection. And mint mixes so well with berries and fruit that I can see endless smoothie options here. If you're a mint fan, I definitely recommend this one.

review/summary: Not the real deal
review/text: Kikkoman mirin is probably what's called mirin-fu chomiryo (literally mirin-like seasoning). It's certainly not hon mirin (true mirin). If you look at the ingredients list, you'll see a big give away: Rice, Water, **Corn Syrup**, Alcohol, Salt. I'm not even sure this is made with rice wine. It's got rice and (a very little) alcohol in it, but it's sweetened with corn syrup. That's not mirin.<br /><br />Real mirin is sweetened by rice that has been subjected to the Aspergillus oryzae fungus, which breaks down the rice starches into sugar. It's what's used in the production of sake. Mirin uses the same fungus to produce the unfermented sugars that sweeten this essential Japanese cooking wine.<br /><br />If you're looking for the real thing, go to an Asian market and check the labels. Anything with sugar or corn syrup in it isn't authentic. Eden Foods also makes a widely available and very good mirin made from organic brown rice, rice koji (Aspergillus oryzae), pure water and sea salt.<br /><br />(The salt in mirin sold in the US is not authentic either, it's added to calssify the wine as cooking wine, thereby avoiding alcohol taxes).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, read the labels and opt for authenticity. You won't regret it.

review/summary: Necessary
review/text: Mirin and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00194JM4Q">Soy Sauce</a>.  That is all you really need for authentic Japanese cooking.  And you need it everywhere.  Those two liquids are the foundation for almost all recipes, and are used in some quantity in every dish.  I do a considerable amount of Japanese cooking, and running out of mirin sends me into panic mode and heading out to the store.<br /><br />Don't be fooled into thinking that "teriyaki sauce" has anything with Japanese cuisine.  Purely an American invention, true teriyaki cooking is a combination of mirin and soy sauce, based on the meat or vegetables which are then slowly cooked, rotating sides until they become a delicious brown sticky mess.  It is sooo much better than the fast food restaurants try to pass off as "Japanese teriyaki".<br /><br />When it comes to brands, it is hard to go wrong with Kikkoman.  For both mirin and soy sauce, they put out a consistently good product that you can count on to enhance your cooking.  There are probably more refined and expensive brands out there, but Kikkoman does me just fine, as it does for the millions of Japanese households where it sees daily use.<br /><br />As a sweetened wine, mirin adds flavor as well as nutrients to a dish, and can even be used as a sugar substitute in some recipes for those trying to escape from refined white sugar.  Check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804835942">Japanese Foods That Heal</a> for an in-depth discussion on mirin's health benefits and uses.

review/summary: The secret ingredient
review/text: I'm not sure why, but it seems like a lot of the recipes my friends have for teriyaki sauce are almost exactly like mine. Except for this one ingredient. Then they want to know why mine tastes a lot better. It's the mirin, plus using a bit less sugar because my husband prefers not-as-sweet teriyaki sauces.<br />For quick meals at home, I just mix the ingredients in a measuring cup, and stir them directly in my wok without making a glossy sauce out of it. For grilling, I cook the sauce and thicken it with corn starch mixed into a couple tablespoons of mirin. We also use mirin for our rice balls to add a little flavor to the rice. This is a nice inexpensive choice for mirin and adds a good flavor. Like vinegar, soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce, it's a staple in my kitchen for homecooked meals.

I like the fact that it is pure fruit and good for her.<br /><br />We kept the empty pouch as a reminder to buy some. Months later, we finally did and she is enjoying them. The product is a bit expensive compared to buying some fruit but I would definitely recommend Peter Rabbit Organics fruit snacks to children of all ages.

review/text: My children & I have sampled a couple of other brands of squeezable fruit. One they loved, but only comes in applesauce and another they all disliked (the one that comes from someone's kitchen.) These, however, were a big hit! My kiddos are not toddlers, but I'm still looking for fun, easy ways to get fruits and vegetables down them. I'm taking them in my lunch as well. I only wish they had a variety pack.

review/summary: A favorite part of my preschoolers lunch
review/text: Getting fruit to school in edible condition (according to my very particular preschooler) is quite a challenge. I'm so glad we found these "squeezy fruits" as we call them. My daughter gets them in almost every lunch, and I don't feel bad sending them with her. It's important to me that things be organic and not have added sugar. I was actually surprised to see that these purees also contain only the fruit listed. It's not applesauce with a bit of strawberry and banana tossed in. It is strawberry and banana.

review/summary: Great portable and healthy snack for toddlers
review/text: Great product.  Pricey, but I try to tell myself that fruit and my child's nutrition is one place where I SHOULD spend a little extra (sure it's easy to give him some sort of cracker or processed food in the car that costs pennies, but is that the right thing...)!  I compared many of the different "pouch fruit purees" on the market, and what I liked about this brand and flavor is that it's 100% banana and strawberries--not diluted down with applesauce.  Not that there's anything wrong with apple sauce, but I feel better about the price knowing that it wasn't mostly applesauce that I could get way less expensive out of a jar.  Organic strawberries are expensive, and yet one of the fruits most important to buy organic (because they harbor so many pesticides).  My son sucks down these "smoothies" in no time--kind of hilarious.  The only drawback I see is that they are technically pretty high in sugar.  Of course they are natural fruit sugars, but it's sugar nonetheless.  But I think that's a pretty low "con" as I really can't complain if my kid's getting natural organic fruit in his body.

I like that it's a bit different than the usual applesauce.  The only problem we have is that sometimes she likes to shake the tube and drops go flying everywhere.  If I keep a close watch on her though she's usually okay.

review/summary: SAVED OUR SANITY ON A 4-HOUR PLANE RIDE!
review/text: (Because we tried all three, I wanted to post these on each pouch page.)<br /><br />YUM! Our 17 month old daughter loves them. When we heard about these new pouches, they were a _must try_. We couldnt decide on a fruit combination, so we ordered a case of each. This worked out well, because the order qualified for amazons free shipping. They arrived very quickly in easy to open cases.<br /><br />We consolidated them to a box in the pantry so we could get to them faster and because those pouches can kind of slide around. :) Our daughter is all about choices right now and so we let her decide which one she'd like to try first. She looked carefully at each of them then said "NANA! ARN! BUH-NEE! HOP! HOP!" and so chose the Mango, Banana and Orange...and it remains her favorite of the three (although, she would never give up the others if offered).<br /><br />Now, the plane ride...we recently took a trip to visit grandma from San Jose to Austin - a 4+ hour airflight that we were somewhat nervous about. We packed our fruit pouches and other goodies. It became a special treat as we rolled out to the tarmac and then took off into the sky. She happily ate and when she was done, sat quietly and contently looking at the pouch...pointing at the bunny and the orange and the banana, (we told/showed her there was a mango too).<br /><br />When we ran out of pouches, we went to the whole foods - but they were not yet available there. They did have another brand, which we reluctantly purchased because unlike the peter rabbit pouches - the cap was so tiny, it could be a serious choking hazzard should it get into the hands (or mouth) of our little lady. The combination was also different and she didnt really care for the other kind as much.<br /><br />Though she cant say alot of words, she does sign quite a few and she runs to the pantry, points and signs "more, please...more please!! please!!" Which is pretty funny to see.<br /><br />We took some video the day they arrived, I'll have to see if I can find it and post as part of the review.<br /><br />All the best!

review/summary: Tastes like a fresh peach
review/text: I have fallen in love with this tea.  It reminds me heavily of the peach tea that you can get from the Olive Garden that has fresh peach tea slices in the glasses.  You get that same fresh peach flavor.<br /><br />There is only one reason I didn't give this product a 5.  To get this strong peach flavor, I need to use two of the pods for my iced tea glass as one pod only makes eleven ounces of tea.  If they would make a larger pod for say 20 ounces of tea then I would be ecstatic.

review/summary: Warning:  Peachy, sugary, strong!
review/text: This review is under my name because that's the way the account is set up, but my wife wrote the following:  If you go by the directions and use the pod, draining the results into an 11 oz. mug or glass filled with ice, you may find it undrinkably peachy and overly sweet. I mean, it doesn't "say" peach so much as scream it.  I diluted it with a lot of water, and it was a little better.  On my second try, I used a large, sturdy, microwaveable measuring cup to catch the tea, and ran water through the pod twice.  If you've never done that, the easiest way is to flip up the pod lid and push it back down quickly without removing the pod, so it recycles.  Then I poured half of it into a large unbreakable "Clacks" mug filled with ice. I suggest you taste it, and if you need to dilute a little further, just add a little more cold, filtered water.  As the package says, putting hot tea directly into an ice-filled glass may cause it to crack. That's why I used a glass measuring cup that's resistant to temperature changes as well as a beer stein-type mug made from an unbreakable poly.  Anyway, the results of my second method was enough iced tea for myself and my husband using a single pod.  It still tasted quite peachy and wasn't over-sweet.  I even got that odd "fuzzy" feeling on my tongue that I get from real peach tea, in fact.  Seems to me that getting two glasses for the price of one makes this a good deal.  BTW, if your tea turns a little cloudy, I should note that I've occasionally had that happen with traditionally brewed tea as well. (The tea in one mug did, the other didn't.) I forget the explanation for that which I was given years ago, but it doesn't affect the flavor.

review/summary: The mini-rolls fit most diets and the candy is darn tasty
review/text: I can't believe I brought 5 pounds of Neccos into the house. Yes, Halloween is coming, eventually, but these will be long gone by then!<br /><br />If you have not eaten Necco's before they are a thin hard very tasty little candy wafer with a variety of flavors like chocolate, licorice, and mint, and pastel colors. Being sensitive to artificial flavors and colors this is one of the only candies I can eat. This is likely not true for others with the same troubles by for me these taste great and don't cause allergy problems. Be mindful of your dental work. Yes, these are thin wafers, but they are pretty solid and from experience I've learned that crunching them in your mouth could break a crown or get stuck under bridge work.<br /><br />These wafers bring back memories as they were one of the favorite candies around when I was growing up. As an adult it's really nice to be able to have these in the house with out blowing anyone's diet.<br /><br />This mini-roll is just the right size for setting the right boundaries around portion control. I have one or two a day and that works.<br /><br />These arrive literally in a 5 pound box surrounded by plastic. To avoid having having this box sitting in the middle of the dining table I dug up an old candy jar which looks must better as a center piece.

review/summary: A crunchy, healthier substitute to granola!
review/text: I like to add these Sprinkles to my yogurt as it gives me the needed daily fiber easily and it has much less calories/ fat when compared to granola or other items that you can add to your yogurt (i.e. M and M's). It also pairs nicely with ice cream - instead of nuts you can add this on top. It comes in a nice shaker bottle too which is helpful when cooking. I also use the Sprinkles to replace bread crumbs when making a breaded chicken or fish dish. I've also had some luck finding people who use this on a daily basis in their meals and there are many on line recipes that have helped me come up with new ideas when using Sprinkles. Great product!

review/summary: What do you mean you've never heard of White BBQ Sauce???
review/text: Only in the barbecue mecca of the known universe (Alabama, not Memphis) can you find a white sauce for barbecue. At Big Bob's in Decatur, if you order a half a chicken they will dip it in a big vat of this stuff before plating. Its fantastic, much better than any red sauce I've ever had on chicken.<br /><br />This stuff is great on chicken wings, fried catfish, baked potatoes, in chicken salad, and even works as a base for packaged dips. You can make white sauce at home but don't bother trying, you cant replicate this stuff. Also great on pulled pork sandwiches with slaw and red bbq sauce. They mix well together.<br /><br />Editorial on N.Alabama BBQ in the comments section.

review/summary: Simply The Best Commercial BBQ sauce
review/text: Over the decades that I have been cooking over live fire, I have used many different BBQ sauces, including some of my own. This one has been for some time the only commercial sauce I buy any more. It's medium thick and a bit spicy without excess heat. It's sweet with out excess. It's the definitive Kansas City, tomato based sauce and it compliments everything from pork to poultry. Careful online shopping will get a better price however, but the sauce is da bomb!<br /><br />I just realized that this review of the Gibson Championship Red Sauce had been moved to the white sauce. I did not review this product. It's good, mind, but the red BBQ sauce is superb!!

review/text: Although I thought I knew it all about BBQ, I'd never heard of white BBQ sauce prior to reading The Big Bob Gibson's Barbecue book. I'm generally an adventurous eater, but the thought of chomping on a piece of chicken dripping white sauce just seemed strange. Until I tried it, that is. It's very hard to describe exactly what this sauce is like. You expect it to be like ranch dressing, but it's not even close. The blend of ingredients complements the smoky goodness of pit-cooked chicken perfectly, and in a completely different manner than a tomato-based sauce.

review/summary: Convenient, but be careful
review/text: I always have this and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019S5444">Alessi Whole Mix Peppercorns, 1.12-Ounce Grinder (Pack of 6)</a> on my table and love the convenience. The caveat for this sea salt grinder is it produces relatively coarse pieces of salt when you grind a portion.<br /><br />While the grinding process breaks the sea salt, releasing flavors that you will never get from iodized table salt, or even unground sea salt, you need to be very careful if you have sodium restrictions. Be aware that the grinder will deposit a lot more salt with one grind cycle than most people realize. By the way, I use a clockwise-counterclockwise motion on the cap to grind my salt - the Alessi disposable grinders seem to work better that way.<br /><br />Another consequence of how much salt is dispensed is this particular grinder is quickly depleted, even if you do have sodium restrictions and use it sparingly. While the peppercorn dispenser I mentioned above will last me nearly six weeks, this sea salt grinder barely lasts three weeks, and sometimes two - and I only use it on the table (for the kitchen I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAUOMK">Alessi Fine Sea Salt, 24-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>).<br /><br />For convenience, though, this is hard to beat, even with the limitations I have discussed. However, do be aware of the possible implications if you or your guests have sodium restrictions because the grinder does dispense too much salt.

review/text: If you enjoy sea salt, this is the product you want.  I love sea salt, it does not seem as "salty" as iodized salt for some reason.  I have never had fresh ground sea salt before, and like the pepper, it seems to taste even better.  Only two minor drawbacks like the pepper from the same manufacturer, there is no way to adjust for fine or course grind, and it's hard to turn the grinder because it's stiff, and small.  Even with the drawbacks, I would still buy this product again.

review/summary: Lifts the Meal to Sublimity
review/text: No phantasm, nothing eerie about the friendly, warm mist lifting from the gentle mound. The concise hills, like sandy camels kneeling in petition of an oasis, were baked and split Russet Burbank potatoes sending a steaming waft as a signal for butter, and for salt. A quick slip of a smooth knife delivered a melting slice of yellow cream.<br /><br />A sprinkle from a common table shaker would not do. Not with a filet recently from the grill waiting. Not with a 1994 merlot resting before pouring. Not with green spring peas buttressing the steak. A plebeian salt could not do.<br /><br />Salt ground from coarse to useful fell into invisible crevices, engaging the potato into evoking flavor. The filet, the merlot, the peas were better for having shared the plate with the potato. No more can be said for this simple salt's necessity. This is what it does. Nothing more.<br /><br />May your potato's request be met with salt ground at the moment before dining.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/text: Very earthy and blah. If you use extra sugar in cappuccino it is fine. I am obviously not a connoisseur by any stretch of the word, but was not impressed by this espresso. It is also not as finely ground as I would expect and as espressos I have had in the past. I will not be ordering it again.

review/summary: Hard small peas
review/text: I have enjoyed wasabi peas for some time. I usually purchase HAPI brand. Thes are produced in Thailand. Great taste, not too hot, large peas that are well coated and crispy rather than crunchy. However, they use artificial colors and palm oil.<br />So I purchased Sunridge Farms brand, and found them to be very hot which is not so bad, but the peas are very small and very hard. It is a chore to eat them.

review/summary: Wonderful Tea
review/text: This is great, not the typical smokey taste from some yerba mate teas and slightly.  And I have notice some weight loss just a couple of pounds, but I am not exercising or chaning my diet.  It will suppress your appetite, and it does speed up your metabolism.  I am over 40 and need all the help I can get.  I only drink 2 cups a day before 5pm so it doesn't keep me up at night.

review/summary: Fantastic Addictive Tea!
review/text: I totally love this tea and I can't live without it.  I don't know what that other person was thinking because I find it to be totally addicting.  My main problem is I like it better than water.  FABULOUS!

review/summary: love it
review/text: This was my 1st attempt to get off artificial sweeteners. I liked it! It takes as much as sweet n'low for each cup of coffee/tea(3 packs)..I should say it takes a little getting used to, it is less sweet that sweet n low(since natural sweet is less sweet anyhow) but you get used to it quite fast! and there's no aftertaste or anything like it.  If you looking for something natural & with zero calories then you should give it a taste. I didn't like "stevia in the raw"

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I can hardly believe how tasty this stuff is. I was first introduced to stevia sweetener in the Sobe Lifewater drinks. I knew that I had to find some for at-home use. I now use it regularly in my breakfast tea, smoothies, etc. Since they're in the packets, I haven't tried Truvia in baking, but I can say that it is great in drinks. Also, I don't experience any digestive problems or gross aftertaste that people often get with other types of sugar substitutes like aspartame or sucralose.<br /><br />Purchasing it on Amazon is an amazing deal. With this quantity I won't be running out of it anytime soon, but I'll definitely be back for more.
