review/summary: worked at first, but then she wouldn't eat them
review/text: At first my cat took her pill in these pill pockets, but she stopped eating these treats.  I ended up using frisky soft hairball treats and she took the pills no problem.  She would never go back to eating these pill pockets, even when I didn't put a pill in there.  The other cats weren't fans either.  I ended up giving them to an animal shelter.  I hope they are working for some other cats

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: For a cat who is food-oriented & likely to gobble anything down, this product is definitely the stress-free way to give cats pills. It's not good for liquids or powders, because the pockets aren't that big. Capsules likewise are a bit tricky, even the smallest size is just a touch too long. But this product is very soft when kept in the resealable pouch & the seal is intact. You can even break off a little from another pocket & stick it over anything you can't cover up. However, if your cat doesn't like soft food or soft treats, or is not accepting food at all, you should try another method, including the old "pry & pop". But overall, this product does what is advertised.

review/summary: My cat didn't like the treats
review/text: My cat usually loves treats so I thought this would be a great way to give him antibiotics he had to take for ten days since he hates taking pills.<br /><br />I tried giving him one without a pill earlier in the day just because I thought it might be easier to trick him with the pill in it later and he wouldn't even touch it without the pill in it, even though he loves treats.  I guess if he would have liked the trick, it might have worked good.  I have also tried putting the pill in a bowl of canned food and he figured out how to eat all the food leaving just the tiny (size of a baby asprin)pill in the bowl while eating everything else.  My mom and dad tried it on their cat and he liked the treat but figured out how to get the pill out, so that is another concern.<br /><br />I would recomend the pill pusher instead.  It's fast and you know the cat has taken the pill.

review/text: I have 4 indoor cats who range from 15 to 10 years. They are usually healthy. One of my 11 year old cats developed a thyroid problem a few months ago and has to have a pill twice a day. Before Pill Pockets it was a constant battle to medicate her and caused her and me a lot of stress. With pill pockets, she can't wait to get her pill and looks around for more.

review/summary: cat LOVES these
review/text: Our 16 year old cat was just recently diagnosed with hyperthyroidism.  The vet says she needs to take half a pill -TWICE a day.  ugh.  If you've ever tried to give a cat a pill by pushing it down its throat--you will know how dreadful it is.  The vet gave us a sample of these to try.  Our cat loves them.  They are soft and have an indent to insert the pill.  Then I just usually mold it in my fingers to make sure it is secure.  The entire time my cat is meowing her head off waiting for me to give it to her.  Within a week, she is trained to be in the kitchen when I fix my coffee and at dinner time for her treat.  She will sit in the kitchen and cry constantly till she gets it.  It is eaten in a split second.  Its soft enough that I don't think she has to take 2 bites, just swallows it whole because she's so anxious to get it.<br /><br />My cats are also binge & purgers with their regular food, these stay down.<br /><br />I'm glad she likes them so much and makes medicine time so easy, and really isn't that expensive.  Had she not taken her medicine so easily, and considering her age.....well, I'm sure there's a kitty "farm" she would have been sent to otherwise.  Buying these in bulk from Amazon made the choice easy for us.

review/text: My cat is on medication for the rest of his life, and I'd been stuffing his pills into small amounts of wet food (requiring that I handle the stuff - not high on my list of likes). I received my first order of these yesterday, and he went nuts when I gave him one just as a test. Needless to say, I don't plan on handling canned cat food ever again, and can't give these things high enough praise.

review/text: These pill pockets are great for getting your pets to take pills.  We have a small (15 lb) dog and have used the Pill Pockets for Cats (both salmon and chicken flavor).  So far she has not refused a pill yet.  They are plyable so you can fold them around the pill.  The pockets for cats are cheaper than for dogs....probably smaller, but fine for us.  We are able to fit two baby asprin into one pocket.

review/summary: I LOVE Pill Pockets!
review/text: Pill pockets have made giving my cat pills a pleasure instead of an ordeal.  My cat has to take medicine in pill form every day.  He is the sweetest, most gentle cat I've ever had, and his feelings get hurt when I try to shove a pill down his throat.  Now, with Pill Pockets, he comes and bugs me when it gets to be around the time for him to have his medicine.  His pill is too big to fit well into one pill pocket, so I just cut the pill in half and use two pill pockets.<br /><br />The very first time I tried Pill Pockets, he did spit the pill out, but after that, he very rarely spits the pill out.  When he does, I just load the pill into another Pill Pocket and he wolfs it right down.

review/summary: Great solution!
review/text: We have four cats, all of whom have very, very different tastes -- one eats anything, one eats only one type of dry food EVER, and the other two are somewhere in between. So I was thrilled that all four of them love these treats. Everyone comes running now when I shake the bag - there seems to be no preference between the chicken and salmon flavors at all.<br /><br />The pockets are half-marble size cylinder of playdoh-like treat, that you can mash over and around small pills. We have three cats who receive pills at least once a day, and this has made the process completely painless for everyone. Our petsitter wrote us a note to thank us, in fact, and has recommended these to all her other clients.<br /><br />One note on the size -- our cats are "chewers" or "swallowers." The swallowers don't seem to chew these treats at all, just gulp them down no problem. The chewers actually chew these treats, and spit out the pills. We get around this by tearing each treat into two pieces, and tossing the empty piece first. The second piece, with the pill, seems to go down faster, without a spit-out pill.<br /><br />A second note is that these are much too small for capsule-type pills, especially for chewers. If your cat is on larger capsules (like some antibiotics are), you may need to find another solution, like emptying the capsule into a treat, or just using these as a reward after giving the capsule "the old way."

review/summary: This is How To Give A Cat A Pill
review/text: We've probably all seen that joke emailed around a few years ago about giving a cat a pill. Most cat owners I've talked to had experiences that weren't much different than the nightmare parody.<br />Well no more! This product made it unbelievably easy to give a pill!<br /><br />My cat just went on heart medication. The (chicken) Pill Pockets work fabulously!  I put several other treats or wet food on his plate at the same time.  He usually eats the pill pocket somewhere in the middle of the snack.  If its the only thing on the plate, he won't eat it though.<br />My vet sold me the first bag of pill pockets. Now I'm back to buy more at a much lower price.

review/summary: nice flavor, but different from regular green tea flavor
review/text: Good if you've been drinking green tea forever and want a distinct change - I got it because they were out of the Oothu green tea and I thought it sounded enticing. I was a bit disappointed only because I was expecting the flavor of regular green tea - the corn flowers make it taste almost completely different even though it is still mostly green tea leaves... but now that I've had it a couple of weeks, I like it - it tastes very good. But as soon as its done I will be purchasing the Oothu version again - until I am truly looking for a change! Then I probably pick this one up again.

review/text: I have only one real issue with this cake mix: it doesn't make good cupcakes. I've made three separate batches (one with baking-approved margarine and two with regular butter) and the tops are flat, even indented, but run out onto the muffin pans. You have to cut circles around the top to get them out of the pan, and they just aren't attractive. Each time I've also gotten some crumbling when I've iced the tops, probably because of the light texture and the trauma from getting them out of the pan.<br /><br />I get compliments on the taste, and the texture is very light. This mix would probably be a fine cake for most uses. But if you want to make cupcakes, especially to decorate, pick another mix.

review/summary: Never knew a tea could taste this good
review/text: Its pricey, true. but after trying over a dozen other lower priced teas, and others that were only lower because of a pre purchased certificate, I decided it was less expensive just to buy what I wanted than try to save.  If I didnt think it was a good value in the long run, I would have had to go with 4 not 5 stars, no matter how much I love it.  But it earns that last star when you get down to it.  I first tasted this at a mall walking by a teavana shop.<br /><br />I was so dazed that this was a tea I was tasting...it just didnt seem real.  I didnt buy any that day, and kept hurrying to my destinatation.  Later I couldnt get it out of my head, and finally went back to be sure, and to buy it.<br /><br />then i went shopping around.  I can usually find things for waaaay below retail, without sacrificing quality.  But not with this.  I wasted a couple of hundred dollars on less expensive blends with no luck.  Eventually I found one that was a close second.  But the same was true in price... other than a prepaid half off certificate I had for that store.<br /><br />I was almost "enchanted" by the runner up.  But once I tried the Teavana again, the other just wasnt in the same district.  It was just too floral.  The teavana tea is more delicate and balanced. If I ever find a deal like that again, I'll try the other tea for use in blending with the distant third place winners.  If even the youthberry is a bit floral for you, tevana sells a lighter blended version with orange.<br /><br />But for me , by itself in the youthberry, you taste each flavor as a separate note, fruity, warm, then aromatically fragrant. I know they say taste is mostly smell.  I actually smell the roses more than taste them... Then at either the beginning or the end of the sip (or so I found, varying by whether hot or cold, may not be there at all for you) there is a brief moment when the notes make a chord or perhaps symphony.  All too short, leaving you wanting more, but at the same time, perfectly filled.<br /><br />If I sound like I'm reviewing a wine..  I have had that pleasure, and I think out of the hundreds of wines I tried, including most of the wines considered among the finest, I never enjoyed a wine more than this tea for flavor.  And at almost no calories!<br /><br />Then again, once I had to pay for the wines myself..for some reason my love for them waned. This tea is one of the few things I think is worth paying retail for.<br /><br />If you hate all things floral, including the scent of flowers, perfume etc...this isnt for you.  I dont know many who do, other than allergically.<br /><br />This is like drinking a cup of sweet fruit tea while visiting a fine florist.  sitting in a garden, or holding a rose.  But somehow it isnt girly, unless you want it to be.  I just found something totally new and different for me when I tasted it, and it was an unexpected pleasure that brought me into the tea afficiando world like never before.  I only like herbals I make myself usually.<br /><br />Oh the other two of my 4, had nothing in common with this, were just herbals I picked up to qualify for free shipping in hopes of finding something I could tolerate that had the benefit of some of the herbs within.  I actually found two I like for two things I knew I should either drink or eat, but hated the taste.<br /><br />The youthberry may have beneficial things in it.  (In fact it does, or so my herbal books say of the ingredients) but its a drink for pure pleasure.  I recently had to give up all forms of soda. diet or not, and was using tea for a flavor substitute.  It didnt really do the job, until I found this.  I like it better than the soda and dont miss it at all now.  I really only switch out from the youthberry for plain water, or something I need the benefit of, and to cleanse my taste buds to go back to this.  Leaves easily yeild two batches of water. I find that adding only about 25% as much I can stretch that to 4 or 5.  In the long run, I'm actually saving money vs soda.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: So, some friends said this was the best tea ever.  As a tea lover, I thought I would give it a shot.  First, the tea leaves and bits of fruit and what not, are large.  It's probably best to brew this tea loose in a small pot and strain it into a cup to let the flavors really develop.  However, for the size of the tea product the flavor was not very strong.  I have never been to a Teavana shop, but apparently they really sweeten the teas they serve.  I used a little agave for mine and I found it to be just OK.  In summary, not the best tea ever, but not bad, it certainly beats Lipton by a mile.  It's also costs a lot more than Lipton...so, there's that.  As for shipping, my products arrived quickly and safely packaged.

review/text: No the only kind of drink, but damn good nonetheless. I prefer foxon park or another sugar based drink, but if there is none available, coke gets my vote. Coke 2012.

review/summary: 60 years of experiencing COKE
review/text: Just a few anecdotes---in the 60s and in Germany, the only Coke product available was "mit limonada", lemon flavored Coke--I switched to the other cola for my Army tour and didn't die or lose my teeth.  Then as a college student in Iowa, Coke in cans was not sold there and one fellow student had his folks mail him two six packs every week,  he became a good friend to share pizza with.  I do miss the 12 and 16 ounce returnable bottles that are not generally available in the US except for the Mexican coke at a buck a bottle.

review/summary: IT'S THE REAL THING...
review/text: Coca-Cola Classic is my favorite cola drink. I can't think of a better beverage to have while eating a juicy burger or a hot dog. I never understood why one would prefer Pepsi, although I know that Pepsi has its own adherents.<br /><br />Of course, Coca-Cola shot itself in the foot when they decided to tamper with the formula of the best selling soft drink in America.  By popular demand, they had to eat crow and bring it back, renamed as Coca-Cola Classic. I am glad that they did.

review/summary: Coca-Cola's Goodness (3.5 stars)
review/text: No I didn't give this 4 or 5 stars. I have a few legatimate beefs with Coca-Cola. I like supporting Atlanta based companies (has anyone been to the world of Coca Cola here? Check it out), and Coca Cola and their products are one of my favorites. It's addactive and with the caffeine will keep you up for a couple of hours. Also it has it's refreshing taste, that makes me want to pop open another one. Thats where the innovation stops here.<br /><br />For about 20 years, I've drank this product. As time went along, this product has gone through some changes, mostly to compete with their infamous rival Pepsi (as well as other companies). For a while I had a rebellion against this soda because of them making changes in their taste to match other companies. I guess thats a marketing technique or something, because the goal is to sell more products, and have a higher turnover rate. And for about 3 years, I wouldn't drink this soda. Just about the start of this year I decided to give Coca Cola Classic another try, and thinking they are going back to the older formula (trust me, you can notice the difference). Coca Cola is on the rise once again, and I hope that it will be back on top with their products in the soda industry. For right now I have a good wait ahead of me because of my high expectations from them.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I've always liked their products, especially Cherry Coke and Sprite, as well as the original Coca Cola Classic. I just believe that it shouldn't try TOO hard in competion, because that can seriously backfire.<br /><br />Chandler Infamous, and I'm ghost. Peace!

review/summary: Classic in every sense of the word
review/text: Ahhhh, "Always Coca-cola!!" Yes, my friends Coke is probably the most popular soda in the world.  You can go anywhere on earth and be able to purchase it, even places like Turkey!  To those places it's like a symbol of capitalism coming in and much more commercialism.<br /><br />Man, I can't believe they used to put a little bit of the drug of the same name in the drink.  Where do ya think the name of the soda came from in the first place?  I'm pretty sure everyone knew that though.  I guess they were gonna make it addictive like how the tobacco companies use nicotine in cigarettes.  Well they stopped that nonsense in 1914 when the Narcotics Act kicked in, phew!<br /><br />One problem with the fridge pack is that it's totally pointless since it doesn't even fit in our frige.  It's definitely terrible for those small friges you get for your college dorm room.  Even when you have an apartment at school it's still lame since the box takes up so much room compared to everything else it always seems.<br /><br />Anyway LONG LIVE COKE!!!  Pepsi sucks.

review/summary: W00, my first review other than Games & Music!
review/text: While I agree with the other reviewers such as Van Halen Fan & Pete, I disagree with 1 part. Honestly, Pepsi DOES have more sweetness as well as tasting a bit more bland than Coke, but other than that, I don't see THAT much more difference than the seperate tastes in the Regular kinds. Anyway, any of the Coke flavors are defeniatly better than any type of Pepsi. Sure, I don't mind any Pepsi AT ALL, but Coke in every way Pawnz Pepsi with the stronger taste & caffeine. Sorry for another band comparison, but, Coke is like Black Sabbath, 2 things that make me strong & proud to be me everyday, while Pepsi is like Green Day, 2 things I fairly like, but too Suguary & Watery for me. :P Anyway, I reccomend everybody to buy a 6-pack of Coke every week at their local Grocery shop! Smell y'all later! >_>

review/summary: The Red Drink
review/text: This stuff is amazing.  I can't quite conceive of Earth having a modern history without this drink.<br /><br />I was never allowed sodas while growing up, so sodas sort of became something special for me in high school (when I could buy them whenever I wanted).  Probably because of this, I drink Coke on practically a daily basis now.<br /><br />* Coke has "sharper" carbonation than Pepsi<br />* Coke is tangier, less sweet<br />* Do not drink canned Coke directly after eating pepperoni pizza - the taste disappears, and for some reason the carbonation is more painful<br />* Coke does not go flat as quickly as Pepsi, and this is especially true at ocean level<br />* Canned Coke tastes better than bottled Coke.  Fountain Coke is a good compromise<br />* According to William Poundstone's book, "Big Secrets," the de-cocainization process cannot remove 100% of the cocaine.  In effect, you have to drink 25 million gallons of Coke a day to introduce 1 ounce of cocaine into your body.  In reality, cocaine *was* completely alleviated from the cola in 1925, when the above statement was probably true.<br />* Coke is less aggressive with the alternative soda market, competing with Pepsi's strange new sodas only by releasing New Coke, and Coke II.  These ultimately failed (like Pepsi's sodas).  New flavors that probably won't disappear quickly are Cherry Coke, Vanilla Coke, Diet Coke with Lemon, Diet Coke with Lime, Coke with Lime.<br />* Coke responded to Pepsi's 3D red-white-blue sphere logo with a 3D rendition of the Coca-Cola bottle cap.  This stays inline with Coke's marketing ploy of utilizing (and still selling) the old glass bottles<br /><br />Coke is the drink of the Holidays, as well!  The company has often combined the red can and the jolly face of St. Nick.  In my opinion, the cursive style of Coca-Cola's logo is more nostalgic compared to Pepsi's modern (and vertical) cans.  Undoubtedly, this affects the older generation's market.<br /><br />Recent surveys have found that Root Beer is a little better for your teeth than other sodas (because, you know, I soak my teeth in it every night before going to bed), and that AriZona Green Tea is actually the worst of all drinks (to cause tooth decay)!

review/summary: I AM REVIEWING COKE
review/text: Coke.<br /><br />The mere word drives my tastebuds crazy...more than I'm comfortable admitting really.<br /><br />My obsession with Coke has driven me to be a human dictionary when it comes to finding the places that serve the best Coke.<br /><br />"Brett, does this gas station have good Coke?"<br />"Unless you're getting it bottled or canned, no. There's not enough carbonation in the fountain drink."<br /><br />Yes, I've went as far as diagnosing what's wrong with each store's offering. The fact that I can't go more than a day should speak volumes, add in the fact that I sneak them behind my girlfriend's back constantly, and going as far as jacking her stash of quarters even, clearly, I have a problem.<br /><br />Problem aside, Coke has a taste no other soda can rival. Past that, you just have to taste and enjoy for yourself.

review/summary: I'd Like To Buy The World A Coke And Keep It Company...
review/text: Coca Cola has always been popular; and there's no secret why. Coca Cola is a very refreshing soft drink with good carbonation that quenches your thirst no matter what! Now this classic beverage comes in "fridge packs;" these thin cardboard containers have a dozen 12 ounce cans of diet coke in them. The cardboard pack even has a handy built in handle for you to carry them almost effortlessly!<br /><br />The idea of drinking coke in cans means that the soda doesn't loose its carbonation as it would if you bought a large bottle of soda. Each can remains completely fresh to the moment you open it to drink it. As for the "fridge pack;" you can load the cardboard pack into the fridge and just reach into it when you want a can of coke; and people like this. You can also remove the cans from the pack, of course, and then place the individual cans themselves into your refrigerator. The cans are also comparatively small so you can carry one or two with you in your car if you wish to take a long drive to get somewhere.<br /><br />The nutrition facts label can easily be found on the outside of the thin cardboard container that they call the actual "fridge pack." Unfortunately, this beverage does contain caffeine as one of its ingredients so ask your doctor before drinking this soda if caffeine is a health concern for you. Coke also uses other ingredients so check out this nutrition facts label if any of the ingredients is a health concern for you.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderfully refreshing soft drink that many people enjoy for many good reasons. It is particularly refreshing with a hot meal or on a hot summer's day when you've been working outside. The "fridge pack" makes it easier than ever before to store the individual cans of Coca Cola in your refrigerator.<br /><br />Thank you, Coke!!!

review/summary: What I use Each Week
review/text: I've used Maggi seasoning sauce ever since I was a little kid. My parents are Thai-American, and we eat a lot of dishes with soup, noodles, and rice. We also make our own Thai sauces, using some dashes of Maggi seasoning. The times that I eat rice or even eggs, I always dash/splash this Maggi seasoning sauce on. This sauce is delicious and great and adds flavor to vegetable and meat dishes. A lot of the Thai people I know use this Maggi seasoning sauce. Plain soy sauce just doesn't compare to this Maggi seasoning sauce. In the past, each time I visited an Asian restaurant, plain old soy sauce just didn't cut the mustard for me. Once you have tried Maggi seasoning sauce, you get spoiled, and think that the typical soy sauce is bland and blah blah. The taste of Maggi seasoning sauce is special and unique. Maggi seasoning sauce is a staple in our household, and I couldn't imagine life without this Maggi seasoning sauce. If you want to have an idea of the kinds of dishes/meals you can create and make with this Maggi seasoning sauce, check out some recipes from one of Maggi's websites - type "descubremaggi" in the URL. Then click on recipes. Once the next page pops up, mark the box for Seasoning, and then mark the box for Search. Then a list of recipes pops up to give you some ideas on how to use Maggi seasoning sauce. This website features a lot of Latin American dishes, but you can use Maggi seasoning sauce on any kind of cuisine as well - European, Asian, American, etc. Try Maggi seasoning sauce. It will bring some flavor to your life!

review/text: My Grandmother taught me to use this when I was much younger.  I have never been without it until the restaurant I purchased it from went out of business.  I could purchase the 3.38 oz. size from supermarket but was spoiled by the price of larger bottle.<br />You can use this on anything from soups, (what a great enhancer) to vegetables and meat.  It adds a distinct and wonderful flavor to anything you use it on.  It is definitely not like soy sauce.  I make a vegetable medley and sprinkle this on to everyone's delight.<br />I am so glad I found Maggi Seasoning here.  I will be purchasing it again soon, I am sure. I may purchase a backup bottle to make sure I never run out again.<br />As to the expiration, I have had bottles for over a year with no change in flavor at all.  No ill effects either.  It has a very LONG shelf life.<br />Anyone who tries Maggi Seasoning in a bottle will love it.

review/text: Obviously, these things are not a healthy breakfast choice, but they sure are delicious. I really didn't get them as a breakfast food, but more as a guilty pleasure. I was a little worried they would taste more like vanilla than chocolate and I wouldn't be crazy about them, but that is not the case at all. They are very sweet and have the perfect balance of chocolate and frosting.<br /><br />I saw where some people had issues with these being stale, broken or breaking in the toaster. I didn't have any of these issues. The expiration date was good for another 9 months, none of them were broken and I only had a small piece of the corner break off on 2 out of 16 pop tarts so far.<br /><br />I'm normally not a pop tart person at all, I always found the taste to be too plain and dry. I may have bought a couple of boxes twice in the last 10 years. These, however, are definitely different and are now one of my favorite treats. A couple of minutes in the toaster and eat them while they're still warm, they will melt in your mouth.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would recommend these for kids, though. They are very sweet and I can see kids wanting to eat a ton of them.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have come back and bought these several times since my initial review. They've become a guilty pleasure and a regular item on my Amazon shopping list.

When I have ordered Jelly Belly jelly beans from other vendors, they have come in plastic bags, shipped in a cardboard box.<br /><br />Since I really wanted what I had ordered, I was disappointed to see that upon return of the defective merchandise, I was only eligible for a refund, not a replacement as Amazon was out of stock on my item. I sent the item back and was surprised to see that today, when my return processed, there is now 1 ten pound bag of sour cherry Jelly belly jelly beans in stock. I wonder if the in stock item is the very same defective item which I just returned.

review/summary: Sweet but packaging was a REAL bummer!
review/text: These jelly beans are my favorite. The problem was that little care was taken in packing. When the package arrived, I was so excited that I opened the package in the parking lot of my office. The inner packaging was broken and I wound up with nearly the full pound on the lot! Try Superior Nut thru Amazon instead; they packed them right and it arrived perfect!

review/text: I tried with trepidation as many of my experimentations with "sprouted healthy snacks" have ended badly.  I usually couldn't get past the taste, sometimes it was the texture and sometimes the detrimental effect on my digestive system of a few of them.<br /><br />I had none of those problems here.  I loved the taste and crunch and was pleased with how it didn't seem to send my glycemic levels shooting through the roof.  I just felt healthier eating this as a snack plain/or with milk/or sprinkled on yogurt.. will repurchase in the future albeit the price makes me somewhat hesitant.  I do highly recommend, however...

review/summary: Tastes great, but husband had terrible gas
review/text: My husband is a Type-2 diabetic who enjoys sweet treats, so I've tried to look for sugar-free products that will agree with him and satisfy his sweet tooth. He loves chocolate brownies so after reading most of the positive reviews here, I decided to buy the six-pack brownie mix and try it out.<br /><br />My husband liked the taste though he admitted it was nowhere near as rich and flavorful as the Ghirardelli Brownie mixes which I use occasionally at home. Taste aside, he also experienced bloating and excessive gas. Initially I thought this was due to something else he ate, but when he ate another brownie, similar effects convinced us it was due to the maltitol ingredient in the mix.<br /><br />I think this mix will be OK for those who are not averse to Maltitol, but I would not advise it for those who are averse to it. I guess my search for the perfect sugar-free brownie mix continues.

review/summary: Tasted great but gave me HORRENDOUS gas!
review/text: Anyone who's well-versed in sugar-free products probably knows what "sugar alcohols" are.  Products like this mix put "Splenda" prominently on the label, but if you read the ingredients, that is not the only artificial sweetener.  This mix contains maltitol, which just does not agree with me at all.  If I eat even a small brownie for lunch, there's no living with me for the next several hours (and my belly gets bloated, too).  If I eat one at dinner, I wake up in the middle of the night with horrendous gas pains.  If maltitol doesn't bother you, you're lucky.  But I won't buy these again, even though they taste great.

review/text: The Pillsbury sugar free brownie mix is great. My mother is a diabetic. I am always looking for sugar free sweets for her. This product makes a great brownie. I put a little of the Pillsbury Creamy Supreme Sugar Free Chocolate Fudge Frosting, 15 oz. (Pack of 6) on them and Granny was one happy camper. They have a great dense/moist texture and a nice chocolate flavor. They also crust well, which some sugar free baked goods have trouble with.

review/text: Extremely satisfied... got precisely what I ordered and wanted.  I appreciate that we are permitted to modify the order while still keeping it in force.  Next time the option appears, I will either spread it out to more than three months or reduce the number.  Six boxes in three months maybe a bit more than I need as I am told to cut back/eliminate.  But these are a great way to get my chocolate fix.  Only the CHOC FUDGE is carried by our stores, but the MILK CHOC is what I prefer.<br /><br />On a similar note, why do stores limit their sugar free inventory?  Because they do is why I had to come online to purchase this product.  I had made requests at our local stores to carry this product, but it was not accommodated.

review/summary: Pleseantly Surprised
review/text: Admitedly, I can be closed-minded when I see food with the words "sugar-free", "low-carb", "Heart Smart", etc...I know there are good-tasting products out there with these words in the title (I prefer diet soda and Crystal Light to surgared drinks), but if I see the above words on anything else, psychologically I shut down. I actually bought these to make for a pot luck that included diabetic colleagues and in a period of open-mindedness, made some for my family. Not. Bad.<br /><br />I sprinkled chopped pecans on top before baking - they smelled great cooking, looked good cooling off. I stared hard at the brownies before cutting myself a piece and...wait for it; I was pleseantly surprised! In fact, they were so good that I helped myself to another slice, but after the 2nd helping I could taste whatever sweetener subsitute they use. Fine by me - this will ensure I don't overload in a moment of weakness.<br /><br />My husband stuck them in the fridge and while still good, they take on a more fudge-like texture. We both thought they tasted like Little Debbie Brownies. He loves them! I glad I trusted the reviews on Amazon and wanted to share my own thoughts for other skeptics like me. If you would like to find ways to reduce your sugar intake without living without chocolate, I recommend these (but just one serving!). Enjoy!

review/text: I have always made Ghiradelli Triple Chocolate Brownie mix that I buy in a large box in Costco.  The entire house smells wonderful and the gooey brownie can't be beat.  So I try this last weekend and the house didn't smell of chocolate at all.  I didn't try it for a couple of days because I was expecting a major let down.  Much to my surprise, I could not tell it was sugar free.  It was chewy and chocolatey.  I will continue to by Ghiradelli for the rest of the family who are not diabetics.  But now I'm a loyal follower of Pillsbury's S.F. Milk Chocolate Brownies.  I'm anxious to try the chocolate fudge but my store didn't stock it.

review/text: I used to buy Betty Crocker's low-carb brownie mix until it disappeared from store shelves. Since then, I have found nothing similar until I saw that Pillsbury came out with a sugar-free mix. I expected it to be similar but I was very disappointed. The Better Crocker mix tasted great--like regular brownies but not as sweet. The Pillsbury mix has a odd texture and they apparently went way overboard with the Splenda. I thought this would be an adequate substitute for my much-missed BC mix, but I think it is awful and I won't be buying it again.

If only they could change the box to something like Happy Bellies (a nice box with a tight lid that's easy to open and then keep hermetically closed). Earth's Best: please re-think your packaging and you'll have a superior product. I have twin boys and they like the cereal still, but I've just about had enough of 'fighting' with the box to open it ... and then end up ripping it so badly that it doesn't stay tightly closed. Maybe I'll simply change to the Happy Bellies cereal after all ... a few more bucks but hassle free and simply yummy.

The banana flavor had a weird smell to it when mixed with the formula (similac alimentum), and also if you're giving it in every bottle, then it can constipate your baby.  So as for EB regular cereal we LOVE it, but the banana flavor not so much.

review/summary: So Good!
review/text: This cereal is great! I always try my little ones food before I give it to her. This tasted so good I eat it for breakfast now. I put it in a mug, pour some warm milk over it and I'm good to go. It's organic, tasty and even though it has no added sugar, it's sweet. My son calls it my "Matrix" diet, I just call it yummy.: ) So very good.

review/summary: so much healthier
review/text: I think it is so important to give the best to a baby, toddler to child. It's so much healthier for them in their first years of life. And it doesn't cost much different than the non-organic brands.

review/summary: Baby girl loves it!
review/text: My baby girl loves this flavor. Apples have always been her favorite, even when I was still pregnant with her :) This product mixes well with liquids and my baby is able to digest it easily.  We also mix it with her formula and she drinks it out of the bottle. We are very happy this is on the subscribe and save program!

review/summary: Twin Boys love it
review/text: Our twin boys have been eating this for breakfast from day one of solids(now 22mos old).  We usually blend up some fresh fruit, a little whole milk, and this oatmeal for breakfast.  Only difference from day one of trying it, is that they feed themselves now.  This is an awesome, wholesome, organic choice for parents, and I highly recommend it.

review/summary: my kids love it
review/text: This is a great cereal, both my boys have loved it (until about 1 year old and then they want something more textuarally appealling for breakfast). I typically spice it up with cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg or other tasty flavors, stir in some applesauce or other mashed fruit, a spoonful of yogurt or tahini, or various other things to keep it interesting. I have also used it as filler for meatloaf and meatballs. It's loaded with vitamins and is probably the most economic organic cereal on the market.

review/summary: Cereal, the way it should be!
review/text: Couldn't find this cereal in any stores near me so I ordered from Amazon.  It was packaged nicely and now I am stocked up and probably won't need to buy anymore cereal as my 9 month old REALLY wants to eat table food!  Watch the pricing as it does skyrocket then come back down to "normal".  I got this product for a little less than what I would spend for a regular box of Earth's Best whole grain cereal in the stores.

review/summary: baby approved!
review/text: She likes bananas or apple, either, when she was 4 months we spoon fed her but  when she turns 7 months didn't want to eat anymore, i did want her to eat especially at bedtime because would keep her full longer, now i put inside the bottle, she eats everyday, and i have no more problems.

review/summary: DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU WILL USE WITHIN A FEW DAYS! FAULTY PACKAGING
review/text: The packaging is faulty and allows moisture into the cereal. I retained all packs in a safe, dry area (we do live in a moist area though). When opened packs to use, they were all so hard & stuck together from getting moist, you could barely even get teh cereal out of the box much less giving it to a baby probably wouldn't be a good idea.
