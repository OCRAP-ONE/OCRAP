review/summary: HORRIBLE Espresso!
review/text: I had high hopes for this only to be VERY let down. I've had the Lavazza "Super Crema" (blue bag) and it was pretty good. This "Crema e Aroma" is some of the worst espresso beans I've tasted. The cream is decent but the flavor is thin and sour. I've tried different grinds, water temps, tamps, etc... nothing helps. I have been making espresso at home for 10 years using high-end consumer equipment so I know how to make good espresso... these beans are very lightly roasted, versus most beans I've used, and very dry out of the bag. Maybe the trip from Italy kills the beans? Either way, if you like good espresso... better than Starbucks quality, stay away from Lavazza Crema e Aroma.

review/text: Do you love the charred flavor of Starbucks at $4 a pop for a thimbleful of overpriced swill?  Then you'll feel like a Mensa genius after trying Lavazza Crema e Aroma Beans. This price is genuinely a bargain if you shop around the internet.  Even if you're using a $20 grinder with a whirly bird blade and a Sam's Club espresso machine, your toes will curl with a brew of these beans.  No I don't work for these guys.  But if you really love your morning espresso or cappuccino smooth and hearty you'll love Lavazza. Just be prepared for friends start dropping by and mooching a fix once word gets out.

review/text: I am disappointed with this product, not that the product itself is bad but that most of the shipped bags were probably old as most had lost their tight vacuum packaging. The loss of tight vacuum in my experience results in the loss of full aroma that is costumary with a fresh packaged bag of coffee. I didn't see an expiration date mark anywhere so I couldn't confirm my suspition. When fresh I highly recommend this product to any sofisticated coffee lover.

review/text: I am trying many different types of coffee, and I don't particularly enjoy this type.  Some people might but not me.  It has a sour taste if you drink it black which is not too pleasant.  The beans give off a roasted almost burnt peanut smell.  The grind is very dry looking.<br />When I took the advice of reading the packaging I made milk based coffees.  Its a much different coffee then.  There is still the sour initial taste, but the after taste is very sweet and caramely.

review/text: I am type II Diabetic and love to BBQ Steak, Ribs, Chicken etc. Until now I have always felt guilty using other BBQ sauces because they are LOADED with sugar, usually the first or second item on the ingredient list. Woody's only has 3 grams of sugar per serving! (Number 7 on the ingredient list) Not only that but because it is so low in sugar it doesn't burn and turn black when BBQing with it. OK, so how does it taste? FANTASTIC!<br />My thanks to the folks at Woody's for letting me BBQ without the guilt!

review/text: I have used Woody's Cook-In BBQ concentrate for many years with great success making my oven cooked beef brisket. However, over the years, it had gotten more & more difficult to find it in super markets. This was extremely frustrating because it is a key ingredient in my recipe and it is virtually impossible to make a substitution. When I was unable to find it a few months ago, I decided to look online for places to purchase it. Since I had not been able to find it in a store, I was thrilled to find I could order it online. So, I did. I purchased a six pack from Amazon.com.  The product arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Now, I have a supply that will last for some time. Wonderful!<br /><br />In addition, on the Woody's site, I read the customer recipe section which provided some additional possibilities for cooking with Woody's sauce.

A few comments about this sauce:<br /><br />- This is not a sauce for dipping; it's for cooking with.<br />- I apply it to chicken or pork at the very beginning of the cooking and let it cook the whole time.  You don't need to wait till the end with this sauce.<br />- Don't use a lot your first time; brush it on lightly with a bbq brush.  You just want a thin layer of it.<br />- For best results use a silicon bbq brush to apply the sauce.  This will help you get a lighter, more even distribution.<br /><br />Give this sauce a try - it's terrific!

review/text: This is, in my opinion, the best Lime Pickle, or Relish out there.  It has a unique tangy flavor and really adds to any curries I make.  Sometimes I just make some Basmati rice and mix it in and I enjoy that as my meal!  It's really delicious!

She's had blooming tea before, and she really liked this.  The overall presentation gave the appearance of a much more expensive gift.  She was thrilled, and I was very happy that she liked it.  It was perfect for her; she's a really big tea drinker.  What's better than deliciousness and beauty combined in a cup of tea?

review/text: Arora is the best Indian spice blend I've come across -- and I've pretty much tried them all.<br /><br />I've used several different blends from this company and they are all excellent.  I usually start off following the easy recipes on the back of the packet and over time make a few adjustments (I like garlic so usually double the recommended amount).  My co-workers (including a couple born and raised in India) think I'm a great cook when they sample one of my lunches, but it's really quite simple and ends up being healthier and cheaper than bringing a sandwich every day.  If I can make food taste this good, anyone can!<br /><br />I also really like the fact that the spices are all organic.<br /><br />I go through so much of this (and Amazon's price is so much better than my local store) that I now have an auto-subscription for regular deliveries.

review/summary: Very good mix
review/text: This is a really good starter mix for Chicken although I prefer to tweak the cooking instructions slightly.  You can reduce the amount of oil by half and cut back on the water too if you don't want it as soupy. You can also add in some plain yogurt or sour cream to make the sauce creamier if you prefer.  But, overall, its a very good mix and easy to make.  There is some prep time involved with mincing garlic, onion, ginger, etc. But it's not hard to do.  You can also reduce the recipe by half and use half a package of seasoning (still use one whole can of tomato sauce but little or no water) and it comes out great.  The mix is set up to use 2 lbs of chicken which is a lot for one or two people.  Also, since the packet lists all of the ingredients, if you are a half way decent cook you can  buy the spices in bulk and save money by mixing it yourself.

review/summary: best potato chips
review/text: I love these potato chips.  I've been eating Season's potato chips for years.  When I buy the unsalted ones, I add a little salt on my own.  They're cooked with peanut oil, which doesn't leave the slight aftertaste that many oils other than this and canola oil do, in my experience. These chips have a great mouth 'feel',light and crisp, not too hard or crunchy.  I highly recommend giving them a try.

review/summary: Michael Season's Ripple chips are a hit with wife!
review/text: We first discovered and bought Michael Season's at Fred Meyer because they are reduced fat and salt, and the taste and consistency are great. But FM stocks only Thin and Crispy and my wife wanted a sturdier version to use with dips. After getting product descriptions from the Michael Season's web site we discovered that they also make reduced fat and sodium Ripple chips. Found that Amazon had them in stock, ordered and received them promptly with free shipping. My wife says that she likes the taste as much as the Thin and Crispy and that the Ripple also stand up to using with thick dips.<br /><br />Also we found that Michael Season's are almost entirely whole chips, whether ordered online or bought from a store, unlike Frito-Lay. After I watched a Frito-Lay sales and stock person literally crush each bag of F-L chips apparently so that he could get more bags into the allotted space I could understand why. Michael Season's is a winner for several reasons. And with Amazon, the price per bag is lower than if bought locally.

review/text: I bought the Ripple lightly salted chips. I find that the chips are very good as other reviewers have said. I like that that they are lightly salted and it is still enough of a salted taste. The chips were not broken (any more than when you get them in a store) or crushed. They are packaged quite well for shipping. This is February and the expiration date on them is 6 months from now (Aug.). 12-8 0z. pkgs. to a box is a lot of chips but for those who don't know it, the chips can be refrigerated for quite a while, even past the expiration date, and still be as fresh and crispy as if just bought. I put extra crackers and cereal in the fridge too with the same results. I have a fridge in the garage so I can do this. I do recommend these chips.

The aftertaste is a bit grassy, which I find a tad odd, but the after-aftertaste is a nice cherry residue--like when you've had a strong tart-sweet cherry candy, like a Jolly Rancher.<br /><br />Each of the tubs is the equivalent of 1.5 pounds fresh cherries. If you eat the whole tub,  you'll consume 250 calories.<br /><br />I bought these to use with hot and cold cereals, and they'll be fine. For eating out of hand, they're okay, too, but the grassy aftertaste keeps it from being a five-star product for me.<br /><br />For those with bridges, crowns, etc, who worry about sticky products--this one is sticky and you'll have to floss/pick pieces off your teeth.

review/summary: KIND
review/text: Our whole foods diet makes eating tricky sometimes, so when I saw KIND bars in the supermarket I was really excited. Our tastebuds are used to nearly no sugar, no salt and absolutely no preservatives or additives so these bars hit the spot. The coconut and almond bars were chewy and crunchy with just a hint of sweetness and they were filling. One bar and I was ready to go for the morning! Mr. MVP had one KIND bar and a yogurt and a piece of fruit and he was on his way. Our supermarket had them for $1.50 per bar so $1.20 per bar is a decent price!

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I was given one of these bars by a friend and began ordering them by the box the next day!  I have an extremely sensitive stomach, and they are a great source of energy for me.  Eating one at the first pangs of hunger buys me a hour before I need a real meal, which is a life saver.  I have taken them on road trips and camping, and they are great there as well.  I love the fact they aren't covered in chocolate, as I'm not a fan of using candy for food.  The fact that they are gluten free means I can bring a box for celiac friends without concern, also a big plus.  I only wish I could buy them locally, but the Amazon subscription is almost as good.

review/summary: Best Bar Ever!!
review/text: This nut bar is made to perfection. It has the right amount of sweetness and the textures are unbelievably amazing. The ingredients make this one of the most delicious snacks and it's just enough to keep you going because it fills you up. You cannot go wrong with these bars, they are my ultimate favorite snack to keep on hand. I could live on these!

review/text: I really enjoy eating these bars they have a very natural and clean taste to them.  The only thing I would like to suggest is a less sweet version of these bars are offered, they are a little too sweet for my taste but that does not take away from my enjoyment of eating them.

review/summary: Hm-hm, good stuff
review/text: My wife tried several different brands and types. Although I am not a big fan of snack bars, I liked this one. Pretty good, nutty, fruity,  not too sweet, not too "healthy", nothing exaggerated. Just feels natural. I like them as a snack with a tea or cofee during a brake at the office.

review/summary: sooo good and no guilt -- what could be better?
review/text: I love these bars and even eat them once in a while as a substitute breakfast with yogurt.  They are so good, and not fattening and make a great on-the-go snack in the car or on the plane.  I have tried many other bars, but none even come close.  Every time I give one to a friend, they are hooked.  My 3-year old grandson loves them too, and I feel good that he asks for them as they have no artificial anything and aren't that high in carbs.  The deal on Amazon is the best with automatic shipping.  In most places they cost $2.00 or more each.  In bulk on Amazon they are $1.50 with no shipping charge.  This one is my favorite flavor, but I like most of the others almost as much.  So, happiness in a bar. . .

review/text: O-M-G...what can I say?  These are the absolute best bars I've ever had!  They are LOADED with coconut and nuts but, most of all, FLAVOR!!!  Gluten free to boot (though that doesn't matter to me), but someone that it does make a difference to...I encourage you to treat yourself to these...chewy, chewy, chewy and so flavorful...did I mention, chewy?!?!  The more you chew the more flavor you taste...just the right amount of honey, NOT the bland old sawdust granola bar you may think of...get them!!!

review/text: The Strawberry and Peanut Butter bar is the perfect bar for those with the strawberry tooth for foods they like. The flavor profiles of the bar subtely blends the fruity flavors of strawberry with the nutty crunch of peanut butter and almonds. They contain 190 calories in total and 100 of them are from fat and also are a good snack for the 4 gms of protein that you get with each bar.<br /><br />Overall a great healthy snack for your mid-afternoon after meal or late evening hunger pangs.
