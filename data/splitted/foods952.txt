review/summary: Double salt &lt;---and DONT forget it!!
review/text: I wanted to try some Salmiack so I bought a bag of the fish , a bag of the cats, "Katjes-Kinder" is printed on the red packaging they came in and these double salt disks.<br />The double salt is strong....STRONG... but it IS delicious though eating more than two or three back to back may not be the best course of action .They are A little too soft however and for that reason im going to see if I can find Double Salt Salmiack with the 'toughness' of the cats. I dig licorice and I will be a regular user of these Dutch varieties from now on

review/summary: Good but not the same
review/text: When I grew up as a kid my grandparents would always bring DZ licorice with them when they would visit us from Rotterdam. Eventhough I like this licorice it is not the same as I remember when i was a kid. My dad told me the old DZ licorice was made from salt from the North Sea and this item does not have real salt. I guess they are trying save money or trying to be more healthy by using fake salt.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I grew up with Salt Licorice and love it, especially the Double Salts. It is definitely an acquired taste though. I wouldn't recommend starting with a double salt and start with a button, farm animals, or cats. I have had friends try it several time in my life and not one liked it with their first try, however if they stick with it and try it a few times it grows on them to a point where they like it a great deal. Now whenever I have some they all want some of my stash.

review/summary: If you've grown up with salty licorice, this might be what you're looking for!
review/text: This stuff is awesome! I grew up overseas where I was able to choose from tons of different varietys of salty licorice made with ammonium chloride and only the saltiest stuff was good enough for me. These totally live up to the double salt name and the ammonium chloride (salmiak) gives this candy the right flavor. However, if you haven't sampled several varietys of salty licorice with ammonium chloride and liked it, I'm pretty sure you find this suff disgusting. I'd say, don't buy it unless you know that you like strong salty licorice typically sold in the Scandinavian countries, Netherlands and Germany.

review/summary: "Acquired Taste" is an Understatement!
review/text: So the story goes like this.  I'm working at the office one day several years ago when a co-worker pulls out a tub of Gustaf's and tells me to try a licorice coin.  Now, I hate licorice.  Always have.  But I decided to humor him.  Within 5 seconds that candy was out of my mouth and into the nearest trash can.  He assured me that his initial response to the candy was similar, but that several weeks later he began to crave their curious flavor.<br /><br />It took a bit longer for me to come around, but it's true.  There is definitely something about this candy that I love.  It's not your traditional candy.  There's nothing "sweet" about it.  It's like a salt-lick for humans, tapping into that part of our primal instinct that craves a salty flavor every now and then.<br /><br />The initial insertion of the candy is a shock, like a weird chemical burn on your tongue that you want absolutely no part of!  Wait it out.  Suck on one of the coins for a while.  Put it in between your teeth and squeeze out the salty, licorice flavor.  It's different than regular licorice, whose flavor is only really apparent towards then end of the candy when you've sucked all the saltiness from it.<br /><br />Take your time with a piece and give it a shot. It's an acquired taste; like coffee or beer, and it's definitely not for everyone.  And it's not one of those candies that you just want to keep in a jar on your desk year round.  But occasionally - say, once every 12 - 16 months - you'll want to pick up a tub and go through it.  That's the way it is for me, at least, and I wouldn't have it any other way!

review/summary: Double Salt and DOUBLE AMMONIA!
review/text: The fourth ingredient in this candy is ammonium chloride. Too bad I didn't read the label before ingesting this product.  It has been several hours since I ate my first and LAST two pieces of this candy and I still have the sensation and smell of ammonia in my nose.  A spicy dinner and a Neti Pot nasal wash did not remove it.<br /><br />This is one of the worst things I have ever had in my mouth (or up my nose...) and I am heartily glad I bought a single carton at a local store before buying a CRATE at amazon.com.<br /><br />I'm a salty licorice lover.  This licorice is very salty, hardly sweet (that's what I expected) but packs an unpleasant and lasting ammonia wallop that I found intolerable.

review/summary: Fun once...
review/text: A lot of the reviews/testimonials I see claim how great this product is for dieting because you'll "never need sugar again." That's certainly not what this product is for, as its effectiveness is questionable and its price is prohibitive (not to mention that simply eating lots of raw lemons/limes would tear apart your teeth/stomach...). These Miracle Berry tablets ARE, however, a fun novelty item to have at a gathering of a few friends. I had seen them on the tv show "US of Tara" and they piqued my interest, and so I ordered some as a surprise for my roommate's birthday. Anyone interested in weird food or fun dinner parties would like trying this item at least once.<br /><br />While fun was had by all, there are problems: While they certainly work as advertised, the effect isn't mind-blowing. Lemons and limes taste sweet and can be eaten without the "pucker-face", but many of the other foods that you can find recommended to try online are not as drastically changed. Which is the other problem: There aren't that many different foods that are great to eat with the tablets. Lemons and limes are best. We tried goat cheese, mustard, hot sauce, pickled veggies, aspirin (which is weird), and a Guinness, but they don't necessarily taste BETTER, just DIFFERENT... Also, while 1/2 tablets seem to work fine, we all had to take an extra 1/2 to make it work better (and the person who said they taste like vomit must have gotten a bad batch; they taste like mild candies...).<br /><br />So all in all, we had about 20 minutes of fun (there were 4 of us; more people might equal more time spent?) before tiring of eating weird-tasting foods, and we still have more than half the package of tablets left that we'll probably give to some friends that have recently asked us about them.<br /><br />The real trick seems to be surrounding yourself with fun people, because otherwise there isn't much magic to the proceedings. It was worth the one-time trial, though, if only to have had the experience. Enjoy.

Some of the people had a much stronger reaction to it, but I didn't get too much from it.  Sour patch kids felt like they should have been sour, but they weren't at all.  Guinness did not taste like chocolate milk or a milk shake to anyone attending.  I think that is a myth put forward to sell more Guinness.  It was interesting for a night.  They didn't last very long though.  We each went through two tablets just to make it through the many foods we had.

review/text: the berries are more than a good time during a party or get together. Set out a few different sour or bitter items, lemons, limes, grapefruit, grapes etc... Then top if off with some beers or wine for extra fun. In my experience avoid most hard liquors, they tend to take away the effect of the berries more quickly and do not taste exceptionally well with the berry effect. Using liquors in mixed drinks like a jack and coke or even a fruity martini is a good time. Overall great experience. Don't get carried away eating too many sour foods, especially if you're not used to them. They may taste like the sweetest thing you've ever had but will still have the same effect on your stomach, not always a fun experience after.  ENJOY!!!

After about ten minutes the effect from a whole tablet fades. 30minutes to 2 hours is probably the effect you get from the real fruit, but these tablets are weak. Other than that, a real amazing treat.

review/text: My girlfriend loves grapefruit, but I absolutely hate the stuff.  For her, it starts and ends very sweet, for me (and most people in the world) it starts sweet and ends bitter.  After we tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LXYA5Q">Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets</a>tablet, there was a small difference for both of us.  For me, the bitterness subsided a small amount-- not even enough to worth mentioning.  For her, the grapefruit tasted like one of the "sweetest" ones she'd ever had.<br /><br />However, the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes.  Both of which tasted noticeably better.  However, the effect of a single tablet wore off completely within 5 minutes.  To be honest, I hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour, but as is, you're paying quite a bit per minute for these things (we paid ~$20 for ten tablets w/ shipping).<br /><br />Would I try it again?  After the tablets we have left are finished, I think not.  I already enjoy gala apples, bananas, watermelon, oranges, and strawberries without this tablet-- I can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit, lemons or limes DIRECTLY (lemon and lime are fine in foods).<br /><br />If you're dead-set on trying these tablets, try it with some of your friends and don't expect too much.

review/text: Purchased two packs to use for a gimmick tasting game at a party, but everyone was disappointed in the pills not working as advertised on ThinkGeek and other sites.<br /><br />Everyone agreed that the pills themselves had a sweet flavor, but didn't alter the taste of anything we tried after the pills had dissolved on our tongues. Didn't ruin the party or anything, just a little aggravating given how expensive they are.<br /><br />Will not be buying again, you shouldn't waste your money on them either.

review/summary: What a waste of money!
review/text: I bought this based on the reviews and I gotta tell you that I was extremely disappointed in the results of this product based on the reviews.  We did not notice little if any change in the taste of things.  I bought "Extremely Sour Candies" from an other vendor to this these with and noticed nothing sweet abou them.  I order 3 packs to give to all my family.  I was so excited to finally get them and the candy.  It was the biggest let down I have experienced in a long time.  So much so that I have ordered from Amazon quite a bit over the years and this is the first review I have written.  The product was that bad.  It left a coating of this candy taste nn my mouth.  The taste turned putrid after about an hour and I had to brush my tongue to get rid of the taste.  This product is not at all what it was advertised to be.  Just a poor gimmick.

review/summary: Very Interesting
review/text: This item is rather interesting.  Have it with some lemons, beer, grape fruit, etc.  It makes things that are bitter very sweet, as you're probably well aware of by the time you read this.  It works, I never doubted it, I just doubted how effective it would be, and it's very effective.  It wears out after an hour or 2, so if you don't like it, it wont be like a bad trip, it goes away relatively fast, but not too fast for those who are enjoying it.

review/text: If you're skeptical at all and think this might be a scam, don't worry.  They definitely work.  I'd recommend rounding up a group of friends, grabbing some assorted citrus fruit (limes are the best!), and trying it out together.  When you first bite into the fruit you usually taste the sourness for a half second, but then it disappears and gives way to the sweetness.  Just remember that even though you can't taste it, you're still consuming a large amount of citric acid.  My tongue and mouth are usually sore afterward.

review/summary: They Really Work!
review/text: I've tried other cheaper brands, but I keep returning to this product and will probably never stray again.  There are 10 tablets in each box and you hold one tablet onto your tongue and let it dissolve.  For the next 30 or so minutes, everything that is normally sour or tart will be sweet.  I've tried this on all sorts of tart fruit and it makes them taste very sweet (some too sweet).  For the price, I wish they'd include more tablets in the box, but they are effective and a much better quality than their competition.

review/summary: Miracle Berries...Make sour taste sweet!!
review/text: I have to admit, I was a sceptical at first.  I had picked up some citrus sour fruits to try, as well as an assortment of other things I'd read about that are supposed to be affected by this little miraculous fruit tablet.  After allowing the tab to dissolve on my tongue I immediately tried some lemon and lo and behold it tasted like a super sweet candy.  Grapefruit tasted sugared, limes were like a lighter version of the lemons.  Lemon and lime combo tasted like a sweet Sprite(tm). I had read that Guiness was supposed to taste like chocolate shake but alas this was false.  No chocolate flavor at all, the berries just removed some of the bitterness.  Tobasco(tm) was pretty tasty though. In summation, these tablets are awesome when it comes to citrus, not so much with everything else, but that's just my opinion..

review/summary: A Big Disappointment
review/text: I would have to agree wholeheartedly with the other one star reviews. This tiny little packet was way over priced and the vendor charged way too much for shipping. They charged $5.98 for shipping an item that they probably could have sent with a single first class postage stamp affixed.<br /><br />I agree with those individuals who said these tablets taste funny and are definitely not sweet.  After dissolving the tablet, the quarter slice of lemon that I bit into was only slightly sweet... MY son said it tasted like lemonade. It did sort of taste like lemonade - more sour than sweet.  After that the effect pretty much was unnoticeable. I tried it again tonight with some raspberries and sour cherries. I tasted no difference, other than that of the strange lingering after-taste that the tablet leaves behind.<br /><br />Another person mentioned having tasted tea after dissolving a tablet on the tongue. Like that person, I did notice a difference but did not really care for the taste. More like an artificial sweetener than like sugar. My son and I were very disappointed with this purchase.

review/summary: My Dog Loves It
review/text: Her's my problem with people like the previous reviewer. I don't need your novice, pseudo medical opinion for a product you have not tried. You are as bad as the people that review a recipe after they change 6 ingredients and then say it was just okay. They didn't review the recipe at hand! I digress... The company has been making this stuff for over 30 years and have not seen any issues or side effects. In fact, dogs and cats seem to love it and they seem happier with better coats. From the Avoderm website:<br /><br />"SAFETY<br />You can feel quite confident in AvoDerm� pet products safety and nutritional value. In the over 30 years since Breeder's Choice first introduced this product line, millions of dogs and cats worldwide have consumed AvoDerm� with no negative reactions from avocado oil or meal.<br /><br />AvoDerm� pet products use only carefully selected suppliers of avocado meal and avocado oil. Years of problem-free consumption of these products indicate that AvoDerm products are not only safe for dogs and cats, but also provide vital nutrients for them.<br /><br />Concern has been expressed by the ASPCA about the consumption of the leaves, fruit, bark, and stems from the avocado tree, with the exception of the avocado fruit which is used for the oil and meal; none of these parts are factors in any of the AvoDerm� pet products formulations and we have no indication that avocado oil and meal as used in AvoDerm� are toxic, poisonous, harmful or bad for your dogs or cats diet.<br /><br />Dr. Art Craigmill, UC Davis, Professor and Extension Specialist in Environmental Toxicology has said that his studies and other research in the United States and Australia have shown that the problem of toxicity is in the leaves and the pit of the Guatemalan variety; the avocado meat of the fruit and oils have not been shown to be toxic. AvoDerm pet products do not utilize any Guatemalan variety avocados, nor do we use any leaves or pits of any variety of avocados for our avocado meal and oil.<br /><br />The avocado meal and oil used in the AvoDerm pet products comes from the meat of the fruit and does not contain leaves, bark, skin or pit of the fruit. The oil is extracted from ripened fruit in which the meat pulp has been separated from the skin and the pit. Through a mechanical separation process the oil is extracted and filtered and placed into sealed containers. The pulp of the fruit is dried, ground, and screened before being placed into its final packaging and than shipped to our facility."<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Do your own research, research the company or the claims about the ingredients or try it for yourself. My dog (Yorkshire Terrier) seems to love this food. He gets excited and waits by his bowl when he knows it is almost time to eat. He does this even for just the dry food alone! Other dry foods that I have tried before would require me to mix in some wet food after a while to make it more appealing. Not Avoderm - he is still always excited to eat it. He also gets a spoonful of the wet food in the afternoon as a snack and he goes even more bonkers for that stuff. I am happy with it - I will be trying the grooming products next.

I am not kidding. I hate paying a premium price and having to go way out of my way to buy Avoderm, but my dog does so well on it that I am going to keep her on it.

But she gobbles this up like crazy.  Its a great formula and the avocado meal and oil in it has given her a most beautiful and soft, silky coat (the grandkids say she feels like a bunny!).  She also has a bit of a sensitive stomach and vomits whenever she has any food with beef in it, or rawhides, bully sticks, etc.  With this formula, no disgestive problems at all.  My only complaint is that Avoderm only makes it in a 3.5 lb bag instead of larger, more economical sizes.  I've sent them an e-mail to ask about manufacturing larger bags.  Otherwise, this has been really great for my "baby".

Avoderm is a healthy food that I trust, and the other reviewer with concerns about avocados need not worry:  it's the stems and leaves of the avocado that are a problem for dogs, not the meat of the fruit itself.  I will keep buying as long as they make it.

review/summary: FINALLY, ANOTHER OPTION FOR SMALL OLDER DOGS WITH TEETH PROBLEMS
review/text: I have have 10 toy poodles and all are over 8 years old and have lost some teeth.  I have searched and searched for a very tiny kibble which, when water is added, will not take an hour to soften up for them.  All others I have tried are so hard  and larger than I like, except bil-jac.  I have been giving them bil-jac for years mixed with canned dog food.  Bil-jac is the only one I had found that the kibbles are small and easy to crumble for them even dry.  To add water to it, however, makes it more gooey.  I wanted to try something new for them but had just about given up.  I tried this brand of canned dog food and that was a hit so thought I'd give this dry a try.  Well, it works just great and they love it.  I use a  Cuisinart  k-cup type coffee maker that also is used in our household for hot water.  I just put the dog food in a bowl add the hot water and it is soft enough in less than 10 minutes.  It is not as gooey as bil jac when wet. The kibble is triangle shaped about 3/8 of an inch on all sides. VERY TINY, which is what I needed. I would recommend this food to anyone with small dogs, older dogs of any size who have gum and teeth problems and have  trouble chewing or are missing teeth and can't chew at all. I am so happy I discovered this food!  P.S.  It's a very healthy food for them too.  As long as the price is reasonable, like now, 15.00 for 7 lbs, and can be bought with Prime 2 day shipping free, I will continue to buy it on a regular basis.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/21/12 - Oh rats!  I went to re-order and price went up to 16.98 plus 5.73 for shipping.  Disappointed, but found another seller who offers prime shipping on this item, thank goodness. Regular USPS does not deliver directly to our house, in the mountains, and we have to go pick it up.  I am not always able to do that due to health restraints, so Prime shipping is very important to us as it offers UPS delivery to our door. This seller always did an amazing job getting our order to us quickly with the prime shipping and I was very happy with them. I regret having to change, but is necessary.

The pops are not red and purple like the box portrays either.  More of a natural looking beige to dark tan"ish"(think dark apple/pear juice)  Other than that, we love them for our kids (and us!)

review/summary: Yikes. There is something very wrong with these
review/text: We just bought 40 boxes of these from a local store to pass out to kids at a school after field day. After sampling them, though, we had to return them! One flavor was a brown/yellow color with flecks of deep brown, the other was a red/purple color--so we weren't at all sure which flavor was which. The red/purple color was very sweet and had a very odd flavor, kind of like apple cider but not exactly. Then we tried the brown ones. Ugh! They had a distinctly rotten fruit flavor with a hint of vinegar. Too late, we smelled them and realized they also smelled off. Obviously no one finished that flavor, but even after rinsing with water we could still taste that rottenness on our tongues. Thank goodness we tasted them before we gave them to the kids!<br /><br />Although the expiration date was 9 months from now, it's possible we just got a batch that had spoiled and the product is usually better. Still, if you order these I highly recommend that you smell them after opening but before tasting.

review/summary: What's Not To Love
review/text: These are all natural, gluten free, low in fat and calories (130 calories and 3 grams of fat per serving) and they taste great.  Simply put I love everything about these chips.  The only problem with them is that they're definitely addicting and I want to eat them all the time.  I guess it's a good thing they're such a good deal here on Amazon (much cheaper than at my local grocery store).<br /><br />The texture is somewhat similar to a rice cake, except that it's much thinner so it has a better crunch to it.  They taste like salted popcorn minus the annoying hulls and un-popped kernels.

review/summary: Get real salty, real fast...
review/text: We discovered these when my husband bought a bag of the Sea Salt flavor at a convenience store. I loved them so I came to Amazon to get a case. This Butter flavor was a few dollars less than the other flavors so I got it.<br />The flavor is divine at first, but I can only eat about 5 chips before my mouth shrivels up from the overpowering saltiness. I did not experience that when eating the Sea Salt flavor.<br />I will probably order PopCorners again, but DEFINITELY NOT the Butter variety. I will stick with the Sea Salt kind.

review/text: I love chips but don't love all the fat and calories they have.  These are a great alternative.  One serving (one ounce) has 120 calories and 3.5 grams of fat.  These taste great and have a nice satisfying crunch just like chips do but are much better for me.  My only complaint is that the butter flavor sometimes leaves a funny aftertaste in my mouth.  I've also tried the sea salt flavor and the white cheddar flavor.  Neither of those leave an aftertaste.  My favorite is the white cheddar flavor.

The texture can be compared to how hand tossed and thin crust pizza are the same. Its a thinner rice cake meets a pita chip. Could have a stronger flavor but I'm just that kind of girl. 4 stars on the muchy rating scale. Feels like you get more in a bag than you would potato chips. Plus they "feel" healthier, which definitely helps when youre slinging back airline bloody marys. Came in a huge box of many but don't threaten me with a good time, They are being whittled down as we speak. Only shame is you can't buy a variety box. Ah well, *munch munch munch*

review/summary: My new favorite!
review/text: I've tried all the Popcorner flavors, and for a while I was completely addicted to the cheddar ones, but now the Sea Salt ones are my absolute favorites.<br /><br />They taste very similar to tortilla chips or baked corn chips- but with a slightly airy texture. And the salt is divine- I LOVE salty things, so the extra sprinkle of salt is much appreciated. These are light, airy, healthy snacks that pack the same punch as a treat that wouldn't be as kind to your body. They truly satisfy a craving for crispy and salty snacks without making you feel as if you liked a giant crystal of salt and scorched your mouth (the drawback to eating Fritos...)<br /><br />Here's a tip though- since the salt isn't baked into the chip or coated on with oils, it's best to REALLY shake the bag of Popcorners before eating- that way all the salt that had settled on the bottom of the bag get sprinkled back on the chips.<br /><br />Great everyday treat that satisfies and doesn't make you feel parched and guilty for indulging. My whole family loves them.

review/text: This product has been waited for, I can personally say all my life. I love popcorn, but hate the things that usually come with it. It always gets stuck in the teeth or in the back of your throat. Not with Pop Corners, here you can eat and eat and never have anything get stuck or choke you. I love it, and I wish I could keep buying it. Sea Salt is my all time favorite and I try to get it as much as I possible can afford it. Buying by the case made it great, having as much as I want, when I want it, but it can get a bit expensive. But when the time is right I will be buying more to enjoy. If I could scream this out my window, I would scream for everyone to buy Pop corners.

The 5 ounce bag is almost the size of regular chip bags, not individual bags.

review/summary: The only problem is, after the first bite, you cannot stop.
review/text: I'm never a fan of popcorn. Hate the chewiness, grease and the sugary flavors. But this bag of Popcorners is no typical popcorn. First of all, I purchased it on line, attracted by the packaging of course (one really eat with the eyes!), which jumps out of the usual bright pink or yellow colors you see when it comes to popcorns. Also thinking it might be just an alternation of "baked chips," already quite popular in the market. Even after I received it, I still thought "The wrapping's really lovely. But I'm just gonna try out a bite...".<br /><br />The only problem was, I couldn't stop after the first bite. Who knew something so simple, with only three ingredients for this flavor, could be this sensational? It's crispy yet thick in the texture. The size of each piece is not too big nor too small. The natural scent of corn is just delightful to the palate. Don't need to lick the fingers....I'm completely amazed and will be venturing into the other flavors. This is one snack food I'd be munching out. Ditch the bags of chips at lunch, try this!

review/text: Like quite a few other reviews, I discovered these on a JetBlue flight. I did try to find them when I landed too. But, it's really not so easy. I did find them when I got home though and have been eating them ever since. The Sea Salt are my favorite by far. I was lucky enough to get that flavor on the flight. If it had been one of the others, I may have never eaten them again. I've tried the Butter (way too salty) and Kettle (too sweet). So, I went back to Sea Salt and stayed there. My favorite thing about them is there are only 3 ingredients all of which you can pronounce.

review/text: Popcorner chips taste great, but don't be fooled by the "low calorie" bit.  They are low in fat compared to regular potato chips, but the calories are fairly close.  For example, the calorie count for 1oz of Popcorners is about 120.  The calorie count for 1oz of Kettle Chips is 150.<br /><br />That being said, if you aren't thinking you're eating them for health reasons, they're great and tasty as a snack!

review/summary: Popcorn lovers -- you really should try this
review/text: I love popcorn but after trying these, I don't know if I should ever bother popping corn again.  The taste of these is wonderful and I really like the crunchiness of the chip.  Best of all, however, one can have them anytime by simply opening a bag.  While popcorn can be popped, stored and eaten later, good as it is, it is never quite as good as it is freshly-popped.  These taste great however, and I would rank them very close to freshly popped popcorn -- add convenience and crunch and they pull ahead in my eyes.<br />Note that I am really basing my comparison on the Kettlecorn variety so I, perhaps, shouldn't be comparing it to plain popcorn, but I would rate this against regular kettlecorn similarly, and I suspect that the regular popcorn varieties would hold their own.<br /><br />The additional sugar in the Kettlecorn version weighs in at only 3g in a one-ounce serving so despite the great taste, it isn't exactly drenched in sugar.  If you love Kettlecorn or popcorn, you should give PopCorners a try.

review/text: This seasoning is delicious! I love that it's organic, so hard to find Indian spices that are organic and already mixed for easy cooking. I tried this with red lentils and it came out fabulous, even my 2 year old had some. I will buy again, can't wait to try their other spices.

review/summary: Yummy and convenient
review/text: I first bought the Cherry Pistacio from Meijer and really liked it but when I went back for more they were sold out of that flavor. I then tried the Berry and the Apple and liked those too. I went to two other stores but haven't been able to find it anywhere else. I was happy to find them at Amazon and ordered a dozen in each flavor including the Peach.  I do have to say that at least for me, the cooking directions need tweaking.  I add more water and increase the microwave time or it doesn't seem to be cooked enough and is too thick. Having said that, I think they taste great.  They're not mushy and have lots of texture, not to mention the convenience of having it all in it's own bowl.  Great to take to work since I'm always on the run. It's true that the price is a bit more from Amazon but at least I can find it when I run out so I'm okay with that.

review/summary: Great new option
review/text: Tried the berry blend after seeing it on display in the grocery store. After trying it I went back and bought the remainder of them (10), and keep checking back for more. I LOVE them. they are sweet, but naturally tasting sweet from the berries - real whole blueberries, and pieces of raspberries and strawberries. I will continue to get these, I make them part of my healthy, low sodium diet - try and you will probably like!!

review/summary: lots of fruit
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:40 Mins<br /><br /></span>To compare with the Quaker Express Flavors, these costs double, but also has .5 ounces more with  a lot of added dried fruit. I tried to demonstrate this in the video. If it's still available, clip the coupon.<br /><br />Update 09/21/12: As of 09/21/12, my local grocery store sells the Real Medleys for $1.79 a piece. I just tried Apple Walnut. Apple Walnut tastes like a hot apple pie from McDonalds. Peach Almond tastes VERY delicious as well. I'd still rather have them shipped to my door with free shipping (Amazon Prime) paying no tax and getting a free sample snack bar. Please always check to see if a coupon is available. Recently, there was a $4.00 clip this coupon. It's a shame you can't use the coupon multiple times for one big shipment. Finally, the expiration dates from Amazon are better than the grocery store. I have a month old shipment with an expiration of 01/13 from Amazon, while a local grocery store has the expiration dates mostly in late 2012.

review/summary: Delicious, a bit over priced, but grateful they ship to Afghanistan!
review/text: Ordered all 4 flavors, so far my favorites are the peach almond and apple walnut. The cherry pistachio is a bit sweet but still just as good. I love the fruit in it, because its real fruit not the fake kind that is in traditional fruity oatmeal. I also like its the perfect size to fill up on. The food here in Afghanistan is not up to par come breakfast time so I ordered these to help make better choices over sausage and donuts for a young woman trying to watch her health/weight. They are a bit pricey, I can only hope they are cheaper on the shelves, but once again I was just thankful they ship them to Afghanistan. Will definitely be buying more once I run low. They are absolutely delish!

review/summary: I love sweets but this is too sweet for breakfast
review/text: I saw the Quaker Real Medleys at my grocery store for about 2.50 a container.  I loved the thought of pistachio and cherry in an oatmeal.  When I made the product, I found it to be robust on sweetness, skimpy on cherries, and fairly generous with the almonds.  The overall sensation was that this product was really nothing to cry home about.  The flavor was fine but the brown sugar and sweetened cherries yield something that is a bit too sweet for me to turn to again as a breakfast option, especially at the current price point.  I hated that the manufacturer used a plastic 7 container.  Plastic 7 containers - unlike plastic 1 and plastic 2 - are not easily recycled.  I'll stick with Dr. McDougall oatmeal (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFRU3U">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Peach, Raspberry, Oatmeal & Barley, 3-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLTM8">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Non-Dairy Hot Cereal, Cranberry Oatmeal, 3.1-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a>).<br /><br />Note: This product has milk derivatives and is therefore not vegan.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: It is as close as cooking it from scratch. Everyone at work has asked me about. Once I add very hot water to it, it makes the room smell as if it was being cooked on the stove top. It almost smells like out of the oven apple pie. I would suggest that you fill it up with very hot  water all the way to the top. Being careful of course not to burn yourself. I usually place it first on a saucer, so I can carry it that way. If you fill it to the line, it is very thick. By filling it all the way to the top, it makes it taste like it was freshly made and just thick enough but not thick as glue, like it would be if you only fill it to the line. Also, I like to leave it covered with the lid that comes with it for about 5-7 minutes and then enjoy it. I would definitely buy again. I do recommend it.

review/summary: 19 Grams of sugar!!! Wash it down with a coke why don't you
review/text: Over half of the calories in this come from added sugar. While oatmeal is healthy for you, Quaker dumps a ton of sugar in to these things to make them palatable. 19g of sugar to be exact. A can of coke has 39g of sugar! Yuck, if you are looking for a high nutrition, healthy, low calorie food, look elsewhere. Over half of the calories in this come from added sugar.

review/summary: Would not buy again
review/text: I love oatmeal and I usually eat the Archer Farms organic brand from Target. Thought I'd give these a go, but it was nasty. I couldn't make myself choke down the whole carton. This was the second flavor I tried -- the first was the Cherry Pistachio, which was even worse and gave me a stomach ache for the rest of the day.<br /><br />I thought the ingredients sounded promising: WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED OATS, MULTI GRAIN BLEND (WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED OATS, ROLLED BARLEY, WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED RYE), DRIED SWEETENED APPLES (APPLES, SUGAR), DRIED SWEETENED CRANBERRIES (CRANBERRIES, SUGAR), WALNUTS COATED WITH ROSEMARY EXTRACT, BROWN SUGAR, DEHYDRATED APPLES (APPLES, SUGAR, FRUCTOSE, CINNAMON, MALIC ACID, SODIUM SULFITE FOR COLOR RETENTION), WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED WHEAT, SALT, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVOR.<br /><br />Part of the problem, for me, was that they're just too sweet. But part of the problem was also that they had a "weird" aftertaste. Kind of metallic and "off." I don't know how else to describe it. Something that doesn't taste like oatmeal or fruit or nuts. Maybe it's from the "natural flavors"?<br /><br />Of course, individual experiences will vary from mine. But I think I'll stick with the old-fashioned way. It's a lot cheaper and healthier to just make regular oatmeal and add your own "flavors" -- fruit, nuts, maple syrup, whatever -- and it won't leave a bunch of little cartons to recycle or go in the landfill.

review/summary: Convenient but way too many carbs and too much sugar
review/text: On its face, this seems like a quasi healthy alternative for breakfast, but no. This is something I ate before adopting a healthier lifestyle.  Now I pay attention to labels, and I encourage you to read the nutrition label before making your purchase. If it still reads okay with you, then great.<br /><br />As to the actual taste, these are very sweet, especially if you add less water for a thicker consistency. They do keep you full for several hours, and hold you over.
