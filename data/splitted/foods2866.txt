review/summary: For Gluten Free Spaghetti, This is the Best
review/text: I have tried a lot of gluten free pastas, and hands down Tinkyada makes the best in my opinion. This spaghetti is made very much the same way as normal pastas, you just need to time the cooking as they say, pull a piece out of the boiling water and give it a quick chomp to see if it under cooked or not and don't just go by the timer. Over cooking any gluten free pasta will result in some pretty gummy eating, so if you have doubts or think it is close to being done, pull it off the burner and rinse it off. If you think it needs to be done a little more you can even pop it into the microwave for a minute to soften it more, but try very hard not to over cook it.  I think the taste is there as well, it has been a long time since I've had regular wheat flour based pasta, but I think this spaghetti tastes every bit as good. I did get a pack of 12 from Amazon and I just kept it down in my pantry until I needed it. Never went stale or anything, was a nice staple to have around. A very good product! The brown rice pasta is quite nice as well.

review/summary: The Very Best Gluten Free Spaghetti
review/text: I love this pasta! I discovered it when I went with friends to a local restaurant (upscale Italian). We were surprised to find a gluten free option, so we ordered a rigatoni dish to see what they found good enough to put on the menu. It was so good we asked the waiter to find out what brand was being used.<br /><br />My sister and niece have celiac disease, and I usually cook separately for them. However at a recent family dinner I decided to serve everyone this pasta under spaghetti sauce, and they all raved. Not a one knew this was anything but regular wheat pasta.<br /><br />I followed the cooking time directions, and the pasta turned out to be close to al dente, so I would suggest that other users of this product do the same. This will avoid the gooey mess that one reviewer noted.

review/summary: Very Pleased
review/text: I rarely eat wheat based products and was looking for a rice noodle that would somewhat mimic traditional pasta.  When cooked properly these are very close to wheat based spaghetti noodles in taste and texture.  They are white, so the color is different but the difference disappears with any type of red or cream sauce.  Will definitely be ordering these again.

review/text: Enjoyed the packaging as well as the product. Cookies taste similar to fortune cookies, with a nice strawberry flavored creme filling. I enjoyed eating one bite sized piece at a time - coaxing the strawberry creme out of its hiding place, which made it seem like there was more to the box then there really was. Makes a great midday snack. They are a bit pricey, but these are a product of Japan so I expected to pay a little more.

review/summary: Authentic absinthe and the first available in the States
review/text: Lucid was the first brand available in the US since the 1900.  French in origin and true to vintage recipes.<br /><br />This is a verte absinthe, which means that when you pour it on a glass, you will see it has a nice soft yellow-green color.  The louche (the result of adding water to it) is mostly white, with some green hints.  The main aroma is anise, but the taste is anise with a quite bitter after taste.  I drank it mixing it 1-5 with ice water and one sugar cube.  The sugar did not modify the bitterness, and the taste remained in my mouth for quite some time.<br /><br />I had read many good reviews on the Lucid.  Most people would agree that it was a good starter absinthe, and not too overwhelming for beginners, but I could not get past the bitterness.  Maybe it was just my batch and I had bad luck with it, but I can not say I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />However, I would rated it 3 and a half stars.  Specially because after trying other brands this is still not one of my favorites.<br /><br />P.S. I refuse to discuss thujone content and other non-sense and myths in my reviews.  If you are interested in thujone, go eat sage and forget absinthe altogether.

review/summary: Best ever Oolong tea
review/text: First tried this tea from a specialty store in Buffalo, NY where it sold for close to $60/lb.  Love it, even though it was only 2 oz.  Search the net for this tea and found it Amazon.<br /><br />It's a light delicate flavorful tea that can be brewed 2 to 3 times by refreshing it with more hot water.  It is non-acidic like some other teas.  It need no addition of cream or sweetner.  I'm currently drinking 5 to 6 cups per day as it is so delicious and light.  It's not exactly a green tea when brewed but a light amber color, with the hint of a flora or fruity taste. The added plus at Amazon is the price and very quick shipping.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend getting this tea for any tea lover and I'm sure they would be pleased if they enjoy a good quality chinese tea.

review/summary: Sorry to Buck the Trend... But I Didn't Like This Tea
review/text: I've drunk a lot of tea in my time - every day for years and years - so I guess that qualifies me as something of a lay expert, loosely defined :o) I was excited about this tea because it's organic and offered at a decent price (because good tea can be pricey indeed). Well... the first cup brews up kinda foul and with lots of tannin, really bitter (and not the good kind of bitter either). Thus it's an absolute necessity for me to do a first steeping, strain it out and steep again to get a passably drinkable cup. This is not uncommon for some teas, but the cup you get is still pretty foul, truth be told: still real tannic and just not a happy quaff. The leaves are relatively crude and large. This is not one of those tippy-leaved harvests where they grab just the tiny bud; this tea was picked for volume production. For an Oolong it seems to have been barely fermented. I find it just a crude tea. Crude and rude. Figured for the price it'd be a good everyday drinking teas and didn't expect a religious experience in every cup or anything, but it just doesn't even rise to that basic standard. I would have given it only 2 stars, but for the price and the fact that it's organically grown. Your mileage may vary I guess, but that's this tea-head's humble opinion for what it's worth.

review/summary: A Favorite Oolong
review/text: Tieguanyin Tea translated into English as "Iron Goddess Tea" is one of the most famous types of Chinese Tea. It has many different translations and is often called Tieguanyin, Ti Kuan Yin, Tikuanyin, Iron Buddha, Iron Goddess Tea, and Iron Goddess of Mercy Tea. No matter what name you use, it is a wonderful tea. Originating in Anxi County in Fujian Province, some of the best Tieguanyin Tea is also now produced in Nantou, in Taiwan. This tea is a variety of Oolong (or Wulong) Tea and has been very popular for centuries. The tea's leaves are dark green and rolled into tight balls. The "Tie" in Tieguanyin is translated into English as "Iron" This is supposedly because as you drop the leaves into your teapot, they ring like iron when hitting the bottom. The tea has the aroma of orchids with no hint of grassiness and its flavor is long lasting. It is a wonderful tea and a great tea to begin with.<br /><br />A variety of this tea comes from Wuyi Mountain in Fujian Province. It is called "Monkey Picked Tieguanyin". According to legend, the tea leaves were very difficult to harvest because they grew on the cliff faces on Wuyi Mountain. Local Buddhist Monks trained monkeys to pick the leaves from the inaccessible tea trees. Today, Monkey Picked Tea denotes a high quality Tieguanyin, although it is no longer picked by monkeys (if it ever was). When buying tea make sure you buy it from a reputable dealer to ensure you are getting authentic tea.<br /><br />Numi's Iron Goddess of Mercy (TGY) tightly rolled leaves DO give a solid plink when you drop them into your pot. Use about a tablespoon full for every cup. The bright, dark green leaves unfurl to about 7x their size after several infusions. Put sure to do a short rinse and 1 minute rest to clean off and "wake up" the leaves. This batch of tea from this specific vendor brewed up a lovely pale yellow broth with a light floral aroma on only slightly vegetal flavor with wonderful mouth-feel. It remained very sweet through several infusions with no apparent bitterness. I started the brews at around 3 minutes and gradually lengthened my infusions. It is only moderately oxidized and not roasted, making a very pleasant and drinkable tea cup after cup.<br /><br />There are better teas if you are willing to pay for them, but at this price, Numi's TGY is an excellent daily drinker. 16 oz. is a lot of tea to drink before it begins to lose flavor, so start brewing as soon as you get the package. Enjoy!

review/summary: A great tea that lasts a long time
review/text: This Ti Kwuan Yin by Numi is a great oolong. It is quite powerful and little bit goes a long way, but what makes this tea unique is that you don't have to stop brewing the tea. Just leave the leafs in the pot and it will reach its full flavor and stay there by itself. Ti Kwaun Yin is unique in that aspect and is popular in China because of it.  Another plus, and yet another reason for its popularity, is the fact that you can get multiple brewings off a small amount of the tea.  I personally find that seven pots is the norm (sometimes more, sometimes less) before the flavor is gone from the tea leaves.<br /><br />Multiple brewings, a little going a long way, a great price, and very tasty tea add up to one heck of a package. If you are sensitive to caffeine, be aware that oolong is right in between green and black teas in caffeine content and the first pot is usually very strong on flavor. It is so strong that some people even lighty coat the leaves in hot water until they expand and then pour off the water and add more to get rid of the powerful taste.  In doing this, they also remove much of the caffeine, so that might be a handy trick for those wanting to cut down on their caffeine intake.<br /><br />Highly reccomend this product. It will last you a very long time and prove to be your staple for tea.

review/summary: Smells and tastes like turpentine
review/text: I've had this variety of tea from other sources, so I have an idea what it should taste like.  When I opened the bag, my nose was assaulted by a strong smell of turpentine - I thought it was the packaging, so I moved it into a plastic storage tub.  The brewed tea tasted equally of turpentine.  I did find that if you leave the tea out in the air, the taste and smell dissipates, but keeping it for any length of time in a closed container causes the turpentine taste/smell to return.  Even aerated, the tea has a very grassy taste to it.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch, but I will not buy a Numi tea again after this bad experience.

review/text: I was looking into starting drinking loose tea and decided to go with Numi Tea Iron Goddess of Mercy.<br /><br />For the first few times I made tea - I enjoyed it - good taste, no bitterness and big whole leafs.<br /><br />The problem is that every few spoons I found a hair attached to one of the leafs. First I thought it might be mine, even though it didn't look like it. The second time I was puzzled. After the 3rd time - I poured a lot of it out on a plate and found LOTS of hairs! They are simply attached to the dried leaves.<br /><br />I am a clean freak and keep all food in clean cabinets. Tea package was sealed all the time with a clip. This hair made it all the way from the factory - where it somehow got to it during the drying process - where the leaves shrink to little balls.<br /><br />This tea ended up in the garbage and I'm back to tea bags.

review/text: I've heard about how good Oolong tea is for you and I heard this was a good brand so I tried it.  It tastes fine -- not grassy like green tea and not bitter like some black teas -- but I was WAY to sensitive to the amount of caffeine in it.  It kept me awake and buzzing for hours.  If you are used to caffeine, it probably won't affect you too much, but if you're like me, you should get something decaffeinated.

My goal is to find really great coffee that is not super expensive. This if the fifth coffee I have selected.<br /><br />I selected Boyers French Roast because it advertised as a dark roast with great flavor. I enjoyed this coffee from the first cup. It is indeed rich, smooth and flavorful. It is strong but not bitter, rich but not overwhelming.<br /><br />After brewing several pots, I tried varying the amount I used. Boyers recommends one tablespoon per cup. When I tried one rounded teaspoon per cup with an extra teaspoon "for the pot" as my father taught me, the flavor seemed as rich and tasteful as before.  I settled for one tablespoon per cup.  Sometimes I just want to breathe this brew. This is quality coffee.<br /><br />I may try some other coffees, but I know I will come back to Boyers French Roast. This French roast is the best of the coffees I have tried. Boyers French Roast is superior coffee and I highly recommend it.

review/text: Like the title of my review says, these little puffs aren't much different from run-of-the-mill Cheerios in terms of their healthiness--though they are somewhat better--but our little man (15 months old as of this date) absolutely loves them.  They are pretty unsubstantial, so he can snack away on them without fear of ruining his dinner appetite.  Other things that I like:<br /><br />  1) They're organic.  I don't know how many pesticide molecules are finding their way into a box of Cheerios, but my guess is not many!  Still, I like that these are organic.  Every little bit helps, right?<br /><br />  2) They dissolve very quickly so there's never any fear of choking no matter how many he stuffs in at once.<br /><br />  3) The container is more convenient that a box of cereal.<br /><br />  4) Like I said before, my son really enjoys these.<br /><br />In terms of health value, I find them to be similar to Cheerios.  If you adjust for the weight or volume differences, comparing the nutritional information shows that the Cheerios have more vitamins and fiber, but also more sugar and sodium.  Though none of these amounts are really significant concerns to me. For example, a half cup of Cheerios has .7g of Sugar while the HB Puffs have 0.<br /><br />Now for the one negative--the real kicker--and the reason why I am giving this very good product just 4 stars.  Purchasing these from Amazon (6-pack, as of July 20, 2011) will cost you about $1.47/ounce.  Purchasing a 14oz box of Cheerios from Amazon on the other hand is just 21 cents/oz.  The HB Organic puffs are 7X more expensive! (And of course, getting a 19lb box at Costco changes the equation further). But unless you're giving your kid a ton of these, or you're feeding multiple kids, the price difference probably isn't a deal breaker.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'd try them both and see which your little sprout goes for.  Can't really go wrong in either case.

review/text: Pretty sure these are the only puffs that happy baby makes that are gluten free. For a baby with an allergy, these have been perfect. My one year old still eats them because she has no teeth.<br /><br />They do go stale in the container if your baby doesn't finished them in a few days.

review/summary: Food allergy friendly for us!
review/text: I want to say THANK YOU to happybaby for making the organic sweet potato puffs that are gluten free.  My son has severe milk, egg, and oat food allergies.  The irony is that these are labeled as a "gluten free" food, but it is also free of the other allergens. It is very hard to find a product that satisfies his allergy needs.  Everything is either milk free and has oats/wheat... or gluten free and has milk protein.<br />We buy this product in bulk from Amazon and will continue to do so as long as they continue to be milk, egg, gluten, and oat free!<br />I'd give this product ten stars if I could.<br />THANKS again to happybaby and thanks to Amazon for making them available in bulk at an affordable price!!!<br />(PS. If your child has food allergies, please read the label and don't take my word on it!  They could always change the ingredients.)

review/summary: Great Gluten Free Puff
review/text: My wife and I really wanted to get our baby some hard food for her to work on dexterity without introducing any gut irritants like gluten to her. Kids don't need the cereals, they add no needed nutrients they can't get from veggies/fruits and meat, but it is a good tool for teaching them coordination, plus it's fun. My little girl absolutely loves these. When she sees the bottle, or just hears us shake it, she smiles from ear to ear and starts kicking her little feet with delight. They dissolve quickly and taste just fine. She has never choked on them, so that's a big plus. They are a bit more than your standard puffs, but the low sugar, and no gluten is well worth the price. Buy these puffs!

review/summary: A fantastic alternative to cheerios
review/text: We didn't want to use GMO, sugary cheerios for our baby. So we tried these. He loves them. Just the right size and shape to pinch them and learn to feed. Maybe a little more expensive than cheerios but they are far superior ingredients, and they are not going to break the bank. Very pleased.

review/text: My daughter loved these. I committed to not giving her wheat in the first year, that was hard to do! At the time I was buying these there were no wheat products in the ingredients. (be aware that companies change their recipes all the time. If no wheat is your goal too be sure to double check the ingredients before purchase) These little puffs are great melt in baby mouth travel food. And the dog liked them, so I rarely ever found them on the floor. :D

review/text: My 13 Month old goes nuts for these! He started eating the regular ones at 6 months and loves them. He is egg and peanut allergic so I loved that they are allergy free. He has recently been diagnosed as gluten intolerant and I was disappointed he would have to give up puffs, since he loves them and they are so convienient. I came on amazon to cancel my subscribe and save and discovered not only one but two gluten free flavors! Ordered both immediately and went to the grocery store and bought a canister of sweet potato to hold us until our order comes in. My son loves them just as much as the others. It is so hard to find convienient gluten free snacks for fiddlers,  thanks HappyBaby!

My husband and I have tried them ourselves, along with our 3 year old son, and we even found them tasty. The best part is that they're organic with no added sugar or high fructose corn syrup, so I feel comfortable having her snack on them.

review/text: My little girl loves these. It's the first thing she signed "more" for. We bought the sweet potato ones because this was the only thing available at our grocery store, but have since tried the others and this is the one she prefers. I do wish the bottle would travel better though. Learned this the hard way, to pack in our carry on on the plan and not the checked bag. We checked it on our last flight and they were all over our suit case upon arrival. So I love that this is the snack my little one loves but I wish the lid would snap or close more tightly.

review/summary: Happy puffs
review/text: Ordered these for our 14 mth-old twin daughters. They eat a vege gluten-free diet, due to family food allergy history. We are expats living in Riyadh, it seems there are no gluten-free baby products available here. Puffs were well received and because they are small, they require good hand-eye coordination in order to pick up and eat. Which means Mummy and Daddy get time to plate/heat (and sometimes eat our own) food. Other reviewers stated the container was easy to open and consequently led to spillages etc. We haven't found this to be the case, containers pop shut easily and stay shut until we open. Babies go through one container of puffs a week roughly, and no problems with softness or spoilage of product. Will definitely be buying again.

review/summary: The Cheerios replacement for gluten-free babies & toddlers
review/text: Just what the title says - for all you parents of gluten-free babies who see people feeding their kids Cheerios everywhere and anywhere, these puffs can be that "anytime, anywhere" snack that keeps your baby happy. The container is already a good size for carrying in a purse or diaper bag, so you don't even have to empty them into a baggie to bring with you.<br /><br />They dissolve fairly easily and our daughter has been eating them as finger food since she was about 8 months old. She loves them and so does our five year-old.<br /><br />One thing to watch out for if you are gluten-free: not all varieties of these puffs are gluten-free, though they are all clearly labeled if they do contain gluten, so it's not hard to identify which ones.

review/summary: Perfect for babies who want to be social!
review/text: I started giving these to my 7 month old daughter because every time her 2 1/2 year old brother had something to eat she looked at his food longingly. She loves them and blazes through them pretty fast. She's been able to work on her dexterity while trying to pick them up and she chews them (she has 8 teeth already) though they dissolve well too. I picked this product since the ingredients are right in line with the foods I've been introducting to her. Wish there were other flavors that were gluten free, but we'll be there soon enough (and other brands don't seem to have a gluten free option). They are rather boring tasting to the rest of us, but for a new solid food eater, they allow them to eat socially with the rest of us.

They are organic and don;t have the sugar like the other brand.  We have also tried the banana and she loved those just as much.

review/text: I just want to say "Thank you HappyBaby!".  Hallelujah!  As a mom who has a gluten free baby who also only eats organic, I was delighted to find this product and what's more important?  My son really likes it!  The cereal melts in baby's mouth, so not much of a choking hazard and it is just crunchy enough that it's nice on those sore, teething gums.  There is only one store within a 30 mile radius that carries this flavor and no stores have the only other gluten free flavor, which is strawberry.  I was happy to find that Amazon carries both flavors and sells them for a wee bit less than the market I found it at.  Woo doggy.

review/text: I have been trying not to give my son foods that are common allergens before the age of one. So in my search for a snack that did not have dairy or wheat or soy, I found these. These puffs contain rice, sweet potato and apple juice - all things that my 8-month old son has tried and is not allergic to. He loves these puffs! I love that they are made from organic ingredients. I highly recommend these.

review/text: My baby loves these and they help her practice her pincer grasp.  Diced fruits & veggies are a little too slippery right now, so this is perfect for her.  I also like that the Sweet Potato puffs don't contain wheat, which she will not have until she is older.

review/summary: Tasteless
review/text: I love the fact that the puffs are organic but they have no taste whatsoever.<br /><br />I can't tell apart sweet potato from any other flavors available by happybaby (we have tried banana and green apple). My daughter never ate them, and now I tried giving them to her little brother and he just spits them out.<br /><br />I'd say that if your baby would not eat bland foods (like baby cereal without any fruit/veggie), then skip these and try other brands. Gerber puffs have a lot of flavor and my kids love them.

review/text: I had bought this for my 12 month old  as he loved eating plum organics puffs. Just wanted to try out this brand on my friends recommendation.

review/text: I first tried the green Happy Baby puffs, which my son loves. I bought the strawberry ones once, and while he liked the taste, the strawberry powder in it is not organic. (It's not even listed in the ingredients above...not sure why not??).  Since strawberries are one thing I prefer to buy organic only, this was a deal-breaker for us.

review/summary: So much better than Cheerios- the Best Puffs!
review/text: First, I love that there is finally a gluten free version of Puffs for my kids.  When kids finally discover the fact they can feed themselves, they can get over excited and stuff 800 Cheerios in their mouth!  At least with Puffs, they dissolve better than Cheerios.  Plus they are cheaper ounce for ounce than the Plum kind and Gerber.  This is a great healthy, snack for little ones.

Snacks are generally fresh fruits or vegetables but they are too messy for the car so these are a good alternative.

review/summary: Famous British Cereal, Introduced in 1932, Tastes Great
review/text: When I saw Weetabix in my local grocery a few months ago, I just had to try it!  How many breakfast foods do you know of, that get mentioned frequently in British novels and on BBC television programs?<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the whole grain "biscuits" are delicious.  They're nutritious, too:  two biscuits with skim milk (no sugar required) provide 170 calories (10 from fat), 130mg sodium, 150mg potassium, 0.5g fat, 29g carbohydrates (including 4g dietary fiber and 2g sugar), 4g protein, no cholesterol, and a few vitamins and minerals.  The biscuits themselves (24 to a package, or 12 servings) are light, crisp, and flaky.<br /><br />According to the package, "Weetabix is great on its own or with milk".  However the biscuits are very dry, so I can't imagine eating them plain.  When you add low-fat milk (1% or 2%), the biscuits soak the milk up very quickly.  If you don't eat your Weetabix right away, the biscuits will break apart and your morning cereal will be a little soggy.<br /><br />But I like Weetabix, even when it's soggy, because of the delicate flavor and pleasant texture.  Weetabix has now replaced my previous favorite adult fiber cereal, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037N1ZEW">Post Shredded Wheat Original Cereal, Spoon Size</a>, and has become an almost daily habit.  In fact, I like Weetabix so well, I ordered a 2-1/2 month supply (also 72 servings, but packaged in smaller, single-insert boxes, making it more expensive per ounce; see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X0VMLU">Barbara's Bakery Weetabix, 7-Ounce  Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> from Amazon!

review/summary: Strange flavor --- I didn't like it
review/text: I normally import my Weetabix all the way from England (being from England myself, Weetabix was always a firm favorite of mine for breakfast), so was delighted when I saw Amazon were selling it at a much better price.<br /><br />I had hoped that Weetabix is Weetabix, and taste wouldn't differ too much even if the product was made by a different company.  This product is made by some company in America, and it did taste different to the brand I typically buy from England.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't like it.  It had a strange flavor that just didn't appeal to me.  I'm sure it's a preference thing though, and there will be plenty of people who like this just as much (or maybe even better than) the British alternative.  I, however, will be going back to importing my Weetabix from England.

The quality of wheat has clearly decreased. The cereal is somehow more bland, less sweet.<br /><br />It's a real shame. They took something that was loved by many and had hugely popular reviews and decided to skimp on quality, thinking no one would notice.<br /><br />Such a shame.

When an aunt came to visit and gave some to her children in a bowl and started pouring milk over it my mother was horrified (and so were we kids!).  We had no idea people ate it that way.  I dont remember the design of the box and whether it was displayed that way, but the logo hasn't changed.  I had some this morning for breakfast, spread thickly with Land o' Lakes butter spread and accompanied by a slice of cheese.  My favorite breakfast (or should I say "favourite"?  Must have been here too long!)  Paul eats it with milk and sugar but I like my Weetabix crunchy, not soggy!

review/summary: Best cereal ever
review/text: I fell in love with Weetabix on a recent vacation to Ireland. This North American version tastes and looks the same as what I was eating over there. My favorite aspect of Weetabix is that the cereal box is completely full of food, you are not buying a box half full of air. This is more earth friendly than most cereals. Also the large biscuits make portion control easy. I eat three every morning, usually with sliced up banana. You have to keep the milk carton close by to keep everything moist as you eat your breakfast. Weetabix... it's good stuff. Now I just need to find a place to buy one of those cool tins like they had in my bed and breakfast over in Ireland.

You take 2 biscuits out of the bag, maybe mix with some dried fruits (I use dried cranberry), pour the milk of your choice, and there you have a perfect breakfast that gives you enough energy to make the morning. The sweetness is perfect to not interfere with anything that you add. In Winter, you can just warm it up for 1 minute in microwave, and you have a nice bowl of porridge. Only wish is that they start to use organic wheat instead...

I was really glad to find it here on amazon they quit carrying it at our grocery store. They flavor is spicy with a hint of sweetness. If you use too much it can be very hot.

review/text: I like Knorr products and have used them for many years. I just wish they would reformulate them to cut out the MSG and reduce the salt. These little cubes, which are a great idea, have 800 mg of salt in each one. That's basically the entire cube! They don't even have a good chipotle flavor - I thought they had a fake smoke flavor.<br /><br />Instead of these little cubes, I suggest McCormick's range of MSG and salt free seasonings (found here on Amazon, some with free super-saver shipping). They come in large containers at a great price, and are a better choice for healthy cooking.

I had some Knorr chipotle cubes (samples from a Southwest Food Show) so tried 2 cubes when cooking mixed white and wild rice.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UPGSU8">Knorr Mini Cubes, Chipotle, 20-Count Box</a>  Nice spicy chipotle flavor. Glad to have a supplier online for friends and myself.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: These cubes are absolutely delicious with any dish.  I have used them as a soup base, on fish, crumbled them in breadings, ribs and even roasts.  I have even used them in plain rice.  Depending on the level of spice, one to two cubes... it is a must try!  Add a little zip to your food.

review/summary: Buyer Beware expiration date ????
review/text: I was very disappointed when this product arrived because the expiration date is in 5 months. I would not have purshased this product had I known. I must have helped them get rid of an old product that was not selling. I would have returned it but they do not accept returns on food products. Buyer Beware!
