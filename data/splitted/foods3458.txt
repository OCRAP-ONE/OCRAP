review/summary: Simple ingredients, grown and packed in the USA
review/text: We have always loved Libby's canned fruits and vegetables, so I was excited to find this case of 12 15-ounce cans at such a good price. I saved another 15% by signing up for Subscribe and Save. Even store brand fruits and vegetables are about a dollar a can, recently.<br /><br />We eat a lot of pears at our house - we prefer fresh pears, but when those are out of season or too expensive, you can't beat the convenience of having a case of canned pears in the pantry! These pears have great flavor, and they aren't too mushy. They're not like fresh pears, of course, but they are the best canned pears I've found.<br /><br />What I like most about these pears is that they are grown and packed in the USA and the contents say "pears, pear juice". No preservatives, added sugar or other unnecessary ingredients, which is important to me when I pick food for our family.

review/summary: VERY GOOD
review/text: I have trouble getting out to purchase fresh fruit- and then it usually goes bad before i can finish it. so this is the answer to both problems. i can have fruit around that lasts for at least a year. there's no added sugar. delivered for free. keep them in the fridge so they're nice and cold. they are very good. if you can get them for less than $1.25 a can with the free s/h_ it's a fantastic bargain as well. I think i paid $12ish. a couple cans had small dents but they were in manufacturer shrink wrap boxes- so it's not amazon's fault- and they weren't that bad and didn't effect ability to open can or its contents. i would recommend- i got on the auto delivery subscription service for this and the peaches i liked them so much.

review/summary: Pear with me
review/text: My childhood home had an orchard with apple and pear trees. I still remember those sweet, tree ripened pears. Now, I get them delivered to my doorstep.<br /><br />Really! These are great tasting canned, sliced pears which are as good or better than I get at my local supermarket without the hassle of lugging them home. I bought three cases (2 peaches, 1 pears) which arrived at my doorstep astoundingly fast, considering that they were shipped about a thousand miles to me by truck, I assume. And there was a small dent in the first can I took out of the carton, as some other reviewers have mentioned.<br /><br />The expiration date for the pears was december/2014. One reason I bought these items was that it is difficult to find virtually any food product at the supermarket that has low/no sugar. These, in low sugar juice, were the closest I could get. Pricewise, they were comparable and I bought enough in dollars to get Amazon's free shipping deal.<br /><br />I may be buying more of my bulk groceries through Amazon. There is no guarantee you will have the same happy shipping experience I did, but it's worth trying. You can spend your time in more enjoyable ways that hauling heavy items home from the grocery store. That's the value of these, to me.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED.

review/summary: Canned Pears in Juice are a Nice Convenience
review/text: It's nice to be able to deal with a pear craving late at night, or when pears are out of season, or just in bad condition at the local grocery store.  I generally dislike canned fruits in syrup, but these being in pear juice maintain their "pearness" nicely.<br /><br />Don't know what else to say about them really; I'm pretty sure most people get the picture.  I eat them chilled either alone or with pudding, cake, etc.  I have also cut them into chunks and added to things like poultry stuffing, and they were tasty that way.  They make a nice fruit ingredient replacement for raisins or cranberries in dishes.

review/summary: Can't make them this good at home!!
review/text: I'm very particular about what I feed my dogs. I often make my own "canned/wet" food and treats at home to ensure the quality and safety of the food I'm feeding my dogs. After looking at the ingredients in these biscuits and checking out the price when purchased in the 12 pound box, I realized I could not make biscuits of this quality at home for this price. My dogs really love these biscuits, and I feel good about the quality of this product. I also love that I can divide these biscuits into various sizes, as I have dogs that range from 6 lbs to 130 lbs. Even with 5 dogs this 12 lb box lasts a long time, and it is packaged in 3 heavy zipper bags, so you don't open all 12 lbs at once and they stay fresh. I would recommend these to anyone who cares about what they feed their dogs.

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE These Biscuits
review/text: I have known for a long time that Canidae is a great product, and is not usually sold in stores, so when I saw these biscuits on the Amazon website, I immediately ordered them.  I have two Eskies (miniature American Eskimo Dogs) so I had to have enough for both of them.  This is a big package, so it was definitely enough.  Canidae is so highly rated for both dry and "wet" food that I didn't have to worry about these biscuits containing anything that might not be good for my Girls.<br /><br />It has "Balanced Omega 6 & 3 Fatty Acids" and they are advertised to help control tartar and plaque.  Can't speak to that yet (neither has had a dental for a year) but I do know they love them.  It's a single biscuit that can be snapped into 4 separate pieces.  My Girls, both under 26 pounds, receive 2 half-pieces in the mid-afternoon (that's 1 biscuit broken into 2 pieces) and although one of them trots off with her half-piece as soon as she gets it, the other stands right where she is and crunches down the first half-piece and looks for the next one (just about demands it!).<br /><br />As the package ran low I knew I had to have more for them, and so re-ordered from Amazon.  Another package duly arrived, before the first one ran out, for which I was thankful.  And so were The Girls!

review/text: The Canidae Dog Treats, Lamb and Rice flavor, is the best treats for my dogs.  I have been feeding these treats to my dogs for years, and they are still the best.  They are snap biscuits so I can regulate how much I give them at a time, and guard against weight gain.  I use the Lamb and Rice because one of my dogs has an allegery to chicken and wheat.  I have never had a problem with Canidae Dog Treats, as they are healthy and safe to feed my dogs. I have been feeding the Canidae Dog Treats for well over 20 years and I plan on continuing to do so as long as I can still get the 12 pound box, as I have Big Boys to feed.

review/summary: Canidae Dog Treats
review/text: The Canidae dog treats has been well received by my 1 year old Presa Canarios.  The "snap" configuration of the treat works great since you can break off as much or as little as you want.  I liked the nutritional content of the treats.  So many times the dogs may love the treats but they are not the healthiest for them.  These treats are good for them and they love them.....  I have switched my dogs to the Canidae dog food as well.....

review/text: I have been buying these Canidae treats for a while now for my dogs.  I feed them the same formula Canidae kibble and canned food, so these treats fit in well with their diet - no worry about upset tummies.  They smell kind of nice too, almost like cinnamon.  There is usually a good amount of crumbs at the bottom of the bag which I just sprinkle in their food bowls at dinner time.  I'll continue to buy these for my dogs for as long as they make them.

review/text: I have fed Canidae All Life Stages food for several years to my mixed dog collection, with great results, but for some reason, had not offered the Snap Biscuits.  Finally, I purchased a bag and offered them up.  Well, they must taste treat-like because they gobble them up, and have evidenced no digestive upsets.  Safe and tasty is the verdict.  My test group is aged two years through 10 years, size eight to twenty-five pounds, in generally good health.

review/summary: Great Value, A Little Broken Up
review/text: I was looking for a bulk price bargain on my preferred premium dog biscuit for my two Vizslas & this definitely met that criteria. Canidae's Snap Biscuits always have some bits and pieces in the bottom of the bag, which is understandable since the biscuit is a snap variety. I was afraid the larger quantity might mean more waste & I was right. There were three (3) plastic 4# bags in a large single cardboard box to comprise the 12#, so they must shuffle a bit & in the end the amount of tiny bits & powdery crumbs in the bottom of each bag was a significant amount of waste. Though I'm sure I could use the wasted crumbs in their food bowl, I am very careful to watch their food intake at meal time.<br /><br />I love the nutrition & quality of Canidae's Lamb & Brown Rice Snap Biscuits, but I will likely stick with the single 4# units in the future, which are packed in individual bags.

review/text: I decided to try these treats because the reviews were so good and the price was great. That and the fact it is such a well known brand I had high expectations.  I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that I thought would love them, however he rates it a 2 star. I was hoping he would be a little more excited about them. They are a larger treat so I break them up into smaller pieces. They also have good things in them.  Most of the time he will eat the treat. Others times he will take it and then drop it in the living room and come back to it later. I will not be getting them again.

They're just really fresh and tasty, not hard and chewy like Clif bars.  You do need to store them in the freezer until you're ready to use them, because they're not formulated or packaged for long shelf life like Clif bars.  And, while they're quite natural, they're probably less nutritious than Clif bars, because they have less protein.  They're more like a fresh brownie, and feel like a good reward for a hard hike.

review/summary: Excellent beans, great taste!
review/text: We've been ordering Raven's Brew coffee for years from their website.  The coffee is expensive but worth it!  The quality is excellent and the beans are always incredibly fresh.  Each blend has subtle differences but they are all terrific.  The only killer was the price of their shipping.<br /><br />I've just noticed today that Amazon is selling this with Prime shipping.  Today just turned into a great day! Recommended!

review/summary: Dead Man's Reach is my absolute favorite.
review/text: Travelling by Celebrity Cruise ship along the Inside Passage in 2004, I found the perfect blend of dark roast beans in a small kiosk on the pier in Ketchikan, Alaska.  The brew was so perfect that I bailed out of the security line to get back onto the ship after 20 minutes to buy a bag of whole beans that I knew I couldn't grind and brew until I got home.  Dead Man's Reach has been MY coffee ever since and when I opened my own tea and coffee shoppe in Longwood Florida in 2006... one of my first orders was Dead Man's Reach.

review/summary: Best Coffee I've Ever Had.  Really...
review/text: Yeah, yeah... everyone says 'Best _____ I've ever tried.'  Well, this really is the best coffee I've ever tried.  Try it, you'll love it.<br /><br />Here's how I make it:<br /><br />+ using a normal Mr Coffee blade grinder: http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Coffee-IDS57-4-Grinder-Black/dp/B00005OTXM/ref=sr_1_20?ie=UTF8&qid=1329666521&sr=8-20<br />+ Fill beans to top of grinder chamber with a small bluge over the horizontal<br />+ hold grind button for 11 seconds.  No shaking, tapping, bumping, etc needed<br />+ prepare in Bunn  auto-drip office type coffee maker using 64oz of water<br /><br />There's nothing bad I can say about Deadman's Reach.  It's dark, chocolatey, nutty, smooth, but not bitter.  Very, Very highly recommended.<br /><br />[Update 7/11/12] - this is a legitimate review.  I have never had any affiliation, or own any stock in Raven's Brew.  Deadman's Reach still remains the best coffee I've ever had, and I've tried many from Amazon (Kicking Horse, etc).

review/summary: Really, the best coffee I have ever had
review/text: I was living in Wyoming and the new coffee shop moved in to town,<br />and were serving Raven's Brew coffee.  I LOVED their roasts, and in<br />a couple of weeks had moved to Ketchikan, Alaska where it originated.<br />I wasn't in town 1 hr when, I was enjoying the first Deadman's Reach<br />latte of so many to come!  I taste tested each roast intently, and kept<br />coming back to Deadman's Reach.  I have enjoyed a pot every weekday morning<br />for about 3 years now, and still can't find anything more enjoyable.<br />It really does make my day.  Try it .... you'll like it!!

review/text: My family lives off Raven's Brew- it has been our exclusive brand for close to 6 years now. Deadman's is my husband's favorite- a rich, dark brew with no bitter aftertaste. They have plenty of blends (check out their website)sure to meet everyone's fancy. The only downside to Raven's Brew is once you have it, you get hooked and no coffee measures up!

review/summary: DeadMan's Reach
review/text: There was a time a little shop from Seattle changed the way we drank coffee, but their time is long gone. Now its time for a new coffee revolution. I've been on a quest for my go to blend now for sometime, due to the decline from my favorite Seattle Company. Thank god my parents brought me back a bag of true Alaskian Black Gold, from their cruise. When you open your bag from Ravens Brew you get the sweet aroma of coffee filling the room, and with each cup you take a trip to heavenly bliss.  If you like the strong taste of coffee without the bitterness and burnt taste, then this is the coffee for you.  Deadman's Reach is now my go to blend to start the day, I've also enjoyed Ebony Pearls and Wicked Wolf.  Do yourself a favor, and wake up your tastebuds, get some Deadman's Reach and start your day off right.  You will not be disappointed!

It's a great October coffee, but we drink it year round.<br />Raven's Brew named it for a reach in Alaska, but it's as smooth and nice as Kona. YOu gotta try it!

review/summary: Great coffee!!!  Cool packaging!  Been drinking it since 1993!
review/text: I've been drinking Ravens Brew coffee since 1993 when someone on the docks in Ketchikan told me to try it.  I'm proud to say I was one of their first mail order customers when I had them mail it to me in Kansas.  Their coffee is smooth, not burnt tasting, and obviously made with love and care.  The packaging is thoughtful and hysterical (three pecker billygoat for example).  The graphics are beautiful (I even have a poster of the original Ravens Brew raven coming out of the coffee cup).  I saw a review on here about fraudulent posts.  I think that is just plain weird.  I have been to their roastery, I'm a real person, and I think this coffee is amazing.  So hey old sour-berry guy -- get over it and have a cup of ravensbrew to soothe your bitter soul.  Try this coffee, but be aware that you will be hooked on it.  As they say on the packaging: "It's the last legal high".  :)  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041FACTO">Raven's Brew Whole Bean Organic Ebony Pearl, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>

review/text: I originally fell in love with both the Wicked Wolf and Bruin blends, but I have been let down by this as well as the Resurrection blend. It is rather light for a dark roast, tasting much lighter than an everyday Dunkin' Donuts Dark blend, nearing a medium roast.<br /><br />The coffee does have a nice even roast, and a bit of oil coating the beans. Nearly perfect for a medium roast blend, which this is not.<br /><br />The flavor is not offensive nor amazing. It is coffee and nothing more. I would be hard pressed to discern this from any other run of the mill medium roast.<br /><br />With my last couple of experiences I will not be purchasing Raven's Brew again.

Finally, this coffee has a backbone and will keep you moving. My family and friends have also raved (if that's possible for a coffee) positively for this unique coffee!

review/text: Deadman's Reach from Raven's Brew is world-class for those preferring a strong but very smooth coffee.  As with most Raven's Brew coffees, the packaging graphics add to the romance of the brand.  The only reason we rated it four-stars and not five-stars was because it is pricey for a mere 12 oz bag.  If only Raven's would plop two more ounces of beans in the bag and hold the price-point we'd be buying a lot more often!  That said, you simply cannot argue with the quality of their coffees.

I love to send this as gifts, the packaging is always attractive and the coffee is such a treat. I can't say enough good things about Raven's Brew coffee. I first learned of them while on a cruise to Alaska, and for any of you who have been on a cruise, the ships are known for having notoriously BAD coffee. When our ship docked in Juneau, I beat feet off the ship in search of a "decent" cup of coffee and stumbled in to a shop that was serving Raven's Brew. It was love at first sip! In every port it became a priority to find the nearest barista offering this amazing brew. When I returned home I was delighted to find it available on-line. A bargin at any price! ;-D

review/text: I was expecting a much better coffee.  I am giving it 1 star because it does taste ok and the vacuum pack kept the beans fresh.<br /><br />In my opinion, this coffee is, at best, a mild-flavored medium roast.  There is nothing wrong with the taste, but there is nothing special about this coffee to justify its boutique pricing.  I also found myself having to use an awfully lot of coffee to get a cup that was tasty.  In no way does this coffee resemble other dark roasts that I have purchased, either in terms of the color of the grind, the heaviness of its body, etc.<br /><br />This is an overpriced, under-flavored coffee with no real kick and no real reason to order again.  I am suspicious of all of the glowing reviews this coffee has garnered already.

Raven's Brew styles their coffees "the last legal high," and the Deadman's Reach blend certainly upholds that claim.

I have been an avid consumer of "gourmet" coffee for close to 20 years and have worked in several different coffee shops. I have drunk I can't tell you how many cups of coffee and this is one of the best. This is a dark roast coffee as it should be: rich and deeply flavorful, but not overpowered by bitterness. Dark-roasted but not burned. This is the coffee you've been looking for.

review/summary: LOVE THIS COFFEE!
review/text: I love Raven's Brew coffee. Deadman's Reach is a wonderful dark roast and my brother told me the story behind the name and the map and that added to the whole experience. Wicked Wolf by Raven's Brew is my all time favorite, but this is second for sure. Stoked amazon carries it now! Yay!

review/text: This coffee is great!  What I love is that it has a bold flavor with a clean finish.  Usually I need a breath mint ten minutes or so after drinking a dark coffee, but not with this coffee.  I wish I could give it ten stars!!

review/text: My son and I are coffee snobs and we critique all of our coffees. Dead Man's Reach is the standard bearer by which we compare all the other coffees. When we pour the hot water in the French press, the fresh gound Dead Man's aroma comes alive and grabs you by every sense and beyond. By far the best coffee ever.

review/summary: No crazy additives. . .
review/text: I can't speak for other owners, but my four cats really love this food.  The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because you need to use their call of the wild supplement if you use this wet food as your cats only food.  Overall this is a great balanced food that is closer to a cats natural diet than most over processed canned and dried food.  Its one of the few commercial canned foods out there that does not have by products or grain.  My cats really enjoy the taste of the supplement too.

review/summary: My two cats really enjoy the Au Jus cans
review/text: Unlike the previous reviewer, my cats like the Au Jus cans.  They enjoy the chicken, turkey, rabbit and duck flavors.  I like to feed my cats a high-protein diet to keep them trim, and this food helps me reach that goal.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving the food 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can't feed it alone.  It doesn't have the vitamins cats need as a standalone food.  It's good for a meal a few times a week or top-dressed with supplements.  I also wish the Au Jus varieties came in the smaller cans.  It's hard for 2 cats to go through a huge can in a couple of days.<br /><br />If you're feeding your cats grocery store foods, they probably won't like this.  If they're used to eating premium foods and occasional raw meat like mine are, they should take to this food with no problem.

I gave the last 10 cans to someone who has 20 farm cats (20 cats will manage to eat ANYTHING vaguely edible to cats, right? 20 cats might eat YOU if you're not careful).  Those cats didn't like this food either.<br /><br />I'm not sure how Wysong managed to get cats to not like chicken, but they did it.

review/summary: Cats go bonkers over these things.
review/text: Normally, when we've brought home cat treats, one or two of our three cats will like them, and one or two won't.  They're picky.<br /><br />With Greenies, they all go bonkers.  We just need to start opening the bag and all three come running.  It's become a reliable way to track them all down.<br /><br />One of them has figured out how to open the cabinet we used to keep them in, so we've had to get more creative about hiding them.  The contortions he goes through to open the cabinet are incredible.  Naturally when he finds a bag he opens it himself, and he doesn't use the zip lock seal, or follow the recommended limit of no more than six treats at a time.<br /><br />Try a small bag to see if your cats like them, but I'm now buying them in bulk.<br /><br />They like them better than catnip.

review/summary: Delicious cookies, but not single serving packs
review/text: Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies. If you're going to give your child cookies, these are not so bad healthwise. However, the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving, when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each. That's a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child, I think. I buy snack packs so that when I'm on the go, I can open a bag and hand it to my kid. I don't feel that I can do that with these.

review/text: These don't taste like cardboard, thankfully; they have a pleasant, subtle almost nutty flavor, as if peanut butter is in them. However, the texture, even in the center of the cookie, is not moist at all!! I was hoping the outside would be slightly crunchy while the inside was softer and moist. They also crumble easily. They are alright but nothing I'd purchase again.

review/text: This was another great find on Amazon Grocery!! They are very tasty, crunchy little cookies.  My family has really enjoyed these, they have a great mild chocolate taste and quite the crunch.  Most of the animal crackers/cookies that I've purchased for my family have become dismembered sometime before my children get them out of the package, these are mostly whole and you can really tell what the critter is before you pop it in your mouth ... Extra fun snack time for the little ones.  All in all, the box of cookies is well worth the price and I feel good about packing healthier snacks in my children's backpacks for school.

review/text: These chocolate chip cookies are addicting! They are the best tasting cookies out there, and they are healthy for you too! They are crisp, fresh, and have an even amount of chocolate vs cookie flavor. They are not animal crackers by any means.<br /><br />The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you have them delivered to some place cool (not to your door step on a hot July day!) as one batch came out a little not-so-crisp, and I'm pretty sure it was because of that.<br /><br />These cookies are almost twice as expensive in the stores where I live if I buy them by the bag. Forget that! I'm sticking with them here on Amazon!<br />Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Did the recipe change?
review/text: I notice that the most positive reviews are from a few years ago, and the most negative reviews are more recent.  We used to buy these in larger containers at the local "healthy supermarket," and my family really liked them.  That was a few years ago.  Now, they sit in the back of the pantry and no one touches them--either the recipe changed or my family's tastes changed.  They are dry, about half of them are broken, and they taste like sweetened cardboard.  (We have the vanilla variety.)  The individual packs are handy for hikes and portable snacks, but I've noticed that they frequently come back unopened.  Guess I'll look for an alternative.

review/summary: VEGANS BEWARE - These contain milk.
review/text: These are delicious and actually have pieces of peanut butter in them. Crunchy but still creamy, and so yummy. However, I didn't check the ingredients before purchasing and assumed that - like the Vanilla, Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal - these would be vegan. They're not - they have whey and milk powder in them. For a non-vegan, these taste great and are a more healthy choice than your standard cookie.<br /><br />For the calorie counters: these have almost 50% more calories per serving than the other Snackimals flavors. Most of the other flavors are 110 calories per 10 cookie serving, and the Peanut Butter are 150 calories per 10 cookie serving.

I do no have kids but when I do these will make it into their lunch  boxes.

review/summary: So good!...........
review/text: One of my carry-over faves from childhood is animal crackers.  I love them.  I'll have to admit I am a big fan of organic items and also am a sucker for clever/cute packaging, so I brought these home tonight to give them a whirl.  Delicious!  These are not a thick animal cracker like nabisco, but a thin crunchy one.  The peanut butter tastes just like a peanut butter cookie should and is not overly sweet.  The package is 7.5 oz and carries 7 servings of 10 cookies for 150 calories (25 from fat).  1 g saturated fat, 2g fiber, 10 g sugar, 3g protein and 2% calcium, and 4% iron.  All natural ingredients, with natural peanut butter, no hydrogenated oils, artificial flavors, additives or preservatives.  I would feel fine eating these or giving to a kid for a sweet snack.  The first ingredients on the label?  Organic unbleached flour and peanut butter.<br /><br />I'm very happy I tried these and will definitely try more of the other cookies in this brand's line.<br /><br />Overall a delicious product, well packaged in a convenient resealable bag.  Perfect for car trips, home or office.  Now you can indulge and feel slightly better about it!
