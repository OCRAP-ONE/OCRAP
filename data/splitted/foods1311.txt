review/summary: Around 3 sprigs of grass out of 100 seeds.
review/text: We planted the seeds in a prepared bed and even put half in planters.  Only 1 sprig grew in the planters, and around 2 more in the bed. No other sprouts emerged.  The 3 are doing fine, and we're hoping they'll just spread.  It's been a few months since we planted, and followed instructions.  Maybe it's just us or we got a bad batch. Gave 2 stars instead of 1 since we didn't have any luck with product, but it's impossible to tell what seeds will grow, so we don't blame the supplier.

review/text: I take this and I also give to my dog who has had yeast issues, and I read that coconut oil helps rid the body of yeast. I love that they are all natural. Great product. I have chronic dry skin and recently moved from a humid climate to a very dry one. I can tell a different in my skin and hair. I love the added benefits to weight, diabetes, blood pressure, kidneys, even though I don't have issues with that, but it's a nice way to prevent.

review/text: I was looking for a way to get my coconut intake while on the go and at work.  I love these softgel pills.  The main reason I chose them was the fact that there are no chemicals added.  These are great for when you are travling and want to take your coconut oil with you.  I love this product.

review/text: A massive sherried whisky, balance is not in the profile of this monster. I think everyone should try it once. High ABV so just take smaller sips to avoid anesthetizing your tongue.  If you choose to add some water do so slowly to avoid drowning it. I prefer the earlier batches, but if you have nothing to compare then you won't know the difference. Not for every day, but a great one to have around when you have some educated scotch drinkers over.  Good stuff.

review/summary: The Best Kind of Ramen
review/text: Pork Ramen is arguably the Holy Grail of Ramen. For reasons that will confound scholars for centuries to come, you cannot find pork flavor in the store. When I found out pork flavor was available through amazon.com, I felt much like Tom Hank's wife must have felt in Castaway when she found out he was still alive. I was thrilled, I was happy to see Pork Ramen, but I had moved on...I had let it go. It arrived in my building lobby, a simple cardboard box full of throwback happiness. I nailed the noodles-to-water ratio on the first try and had a bowl with an icy cold Mountain Dew. It was like being magically transported back to college and for a moment, if I closed my eyes, I felt almost as though I were sitting in my dorm room in the shadow of a loft bed, playing Starcraft online...and in that moment...I was made whole.

With the cost of gas these days; I'll just buy it from Amazon and have it shipped to my door. It saves a trip, gas money, and cut's down on impulse buying while walking through the store.<br /><br />It's the perfect food for a not so perfect economy... Buy some and enjoy!

review/text: Despite the fact that they try to hide it (each packet is 2 servings) a single packet contains 80% of the daily value of sodium, and you can taste it! If you spread one flavoring packet over enough noodles to make the salt level reasonable there's barely any flavor left! It's still a cheap way to get noodles if (like me) you use 1 flavoring packet of other types of Ramen for 2 packets of noodles and end up with excess flavoring.

I have written three notes about the "invalid" code I that came with my jar in order to procure the scoby that is part of what I purchased but must be shipped separately.  I have gotten no responses from anyone.  Someone is not minding the store.  It shouldn't be this difficult.  Besides taking two weeks to ship, what I have is of no use without the starter scoby, and I have no idea of how to get it at this point.  Kombucha Brooklyn doesn't even list a telephone number on their website.

review/text: After having looked at video after video about how to make my own SCOBY (which didn't work out so well), I decided to just buy a kit and let them provide a tried and true plan.  That was a good move.  The only things I did other than follow the simple directions was to purchase some litmus paper, re-purpose a reptile warmer I already had, and save all the bottles from the Kombucha I had been buying for several months.  Now I am drinking my own Kombucha with ginger from juiced ginger root, some bottled with raisins, and some plain and can guzzle my favorite beverage in peace knowing it doesn't cost $3.29 per bottle.  If you like Kombucha  and enjoy a happy gut because of it, do yourself a favor - buy the kit and simplify your life.

review/summary: DIY Kit Made even easier,  for those less industrious
review/text: I debated starting a homebrew via the many tutorials on the internet. I decided to order this kit, unsure if I was making the right decision.  For me, it was absolutely the right move.  I felt more confident as a first timer getting everything I needed in one kit.  Regarding the scoby, it is clearly advertised that one has to order it with a code you get upon opening the box.  Why would anyone want a scoby that has been sitting indeterminately in a box in a warehouse?  It would not make any sense as it is a live culture.  It arrived within days of ordering it online.  For a first timer with no present human guiding me through the steps, the process was not as daunting as I would have thought. I have no doubt that this kit serves its purpose and gives its money's worth for those like myself who aren't as industrious as others. Sure, one can piece-meal all the necessary utensils and ingredients for a bit less, but for me the convenience and tech support are worth the little extra I paid.

review/summary: Great starter kit!
review/text: At first I was disappointed because I didn't realize the culture had to be ordered separately (free with a code that came with my kit) AND my kit was missing the sticker thermometer. Then I realized this system allows for me to get a live, active culture. That is awesome! So much better than starting with a dried or frozen starter. I ordered the culture, contacted Kombucha Brooklyn and they mailed a new thermometer right away. 3 days later I started brewing. KB's product quality and easy to follow instructions helped me make some of the best kombucha I have ever tasted! Plus, they have great customer service. You may have to email or leave a message, but they will get back to you. I am having so much fun with this kit. As soon as I become more proficient with the brewing process, I will share recipes. This is a great product and more than worth the money. In a short time, my constantly brewing KBK jar has become a staple in my kitchen.

review/text: in the photo, it has everything needed in the kit. But you have to get the SCOBY Culture by entering a code, so when it the kit comes, you have to wait all over again to actually make the tea, because there is no culture.  I should have ordered it from someone else. seriously dissapointed.....

review/text: it's so unique getting the scoby that it's not even in the packaging and i don't care what the reason is. you can't show a picture and then the product that<br />i'm paying money for isn't in the packaging. i came to my senses since you can by a scoby for how much? i like to be fooled and maybe you do too. so please go<br />blow 45 dollars on a glass jar to then be told of some free claim for a scoby. no thanks.

review/summary: Go Soft Paws, Go
review/text: I purchased the Teddy Grahams Soft Paws for my grandchildren and was pleasantly surprised with the product.  I chose the Oatmeal Raisin and found it to be a nice soft, flavorous cookie, individually wrapped and ready to be taken on the go for a reasonable snack. It did not crumble apart as it was held and eaten by an 18 month old, yet was soft and easily chewable.  Each cookie has 110 calories with 1 g of saturated fat and 6 g of sugar--better than many of the snacks available.  I was not impressed, however, with the price as I paid $2.69 for an 8 pack box on sale.  However, I will stock up on these when they are on sale again as the only allergens they contain are wheat and soy, making them among the few ready-to-eat snacks that my nut allergic granddaughter can have.  We are so excited to have found them for her and they make her feel "just like the other grandchildren" when I hand out snacks...Thank you Nabisco.

review/summary: Best if mixed with the bars
review/text: The powder by itself is okay, thick and rich, but it lacks depth found in the original Spanish drink. We found that it is best to mix with the Valor chocolate bars. The two compliment each other and give you that rich authentic flavor. Stove top preparation with milk is the best.

It's a little spicy and full of flavor.<br /><br />I buy it at Cost Plus World Market.

review/summary: Not for us
review/text: My family loves eating curries, that is why I was surprised at how much we didn't like this one.  It reminded me of a badly seasoned spaghetti sauce.  Loaded with tomato sauce and not much else.  It was edible, but not very enjoyable for us.  We have tried other sauces made by this company and liked them, so I cannot say that the brand is totally bad.  I prefer the spice pastes though because I can work with them more.

review/summary: Good for a quick, India-inspired meal
review/text: This is very easy to use, just brown up 1-1/2 lbs. of diced chicken and simmer in the sauce for 15 min.  We prefer it on basmati rice, and like a little yogurt or labna in the sauce.  Pataks' sauce has a slightly sweet flavor, and is only a little spicy (the jar says hot, but it wasn't by our standards).  We ate it with some chili relish and mango pickle, to kick it up a notch. Usually we use a dry mix for Rogan Josh by Shan, or make it from scratch and personally I prefer these better, but they take 2-3 hours.  We also usually use beef, which I may try this with another time.  For something fast and easy it certainly fits the bill.

review/summary: Forgiving and authentic
review/text: This mix perfectly captures the cornbread style of the Upper Midwest (which is hard to find in a boxed mix): sweet, not crumbly, not coarse or gritty, and light. It has also turned out beautifully even when prepared very poorly indeed. I once found, after beginning, that both the butter and egg called for in the instructions were missing from the refrigerator--and the oven was unavailable, too. I split the mix into two large, straight-sided cereal bowls, stirred a tablespoon of oil into each bowl, added enough milk to make a good batter, and microwaved each bowl, at 1200 Watts, for 2 minutes. Even after all that abuse, the cornbread was wonderful.

review/text: Our dog LOVED the edible bone, and the floppier brown rubber bone was a favorite for a long time.  The floppy brown bone survied her puppy teeth with almost no damage.  The white bone is really stiff and hard, almost plastic feeling, and she had no interest in it then and as she has aged, doesn't like it now either.  She ignores it completely, not even bothering to bury it in the backyard, which is her favorite thing to do with all her treats and toys.  Maybe other dogs will like it better.  2 out of 3 bones were great!

I bought the "souper" size thinking that he would take FOREVER to chew this. I had gave it to him, and at first he was a bit scared of it. Once he got started there was no stopping him. He ate 90% of it in an hour! If your looking to buy this to keep your dog busy, beware. If a small Boston can chew a "souper" size in little over an hour imagine what bigger dogs could do. For the price, I wouldnt recomend this to anyone. It's just like a "souper" size cookie.

review/summary: EASY Breakfast!
review/text: This is an excellent mix for belgium waffle makers. The taste is delicious, with a perfect, light crunchy exterior. It is so simple, everything in one package, just add water. Most "all in one" mixes are time savers and simple to make, however you usually give up a great deal in the taste. NO sacrifice here, they taste like "from scratch" waffles. I couldn't be more pleased with this product, not only tasty, but very cost effective too! In my opinion, you just can't go wrong with the Heartland mixes. I have tried 3 flavors now and they are all wonderful. I look foward to trying other flavors as well. Heartland makes it fun to make breakfast again with no sacrifice to taste. I have a disability which makes standing for any length of time very painful. I usually have to opt for microwave or toaster or quick options for meals, always loved to cook, so unfortunately, not my favorite decision. These mixes allow me a little "home cooked" freedom! Thank You Heartland!!

It has an overwhelming artificial candy taste rather than a taste that reflects actual strawberries.<br /><br />Really disappointed in this after trying the multigrain version which is amazingly yummy and doesn't contain a bunch of crap.<br /><br />Also disappointed in Heartland for trying to make their product seem healthier than it is by manipulating the fda food labeling rules.<br /><br />I'm not a health freak at all, I just want wholesome yummy FOOD. Not a bag full of dye, corn syrup, and cheap oils.<br /><br />All they really had to do was add a bit of dried fruit to their already lovely vanilla or multigrain mixes... I don't understand why they went this route.

Rexie loves these and knows enough to chew things until he has tiny bite sized pieces to swallow thankfully as I gather most chews have a choking risk.  He looks better since he refused his commercial 4 and 5* dog kibble and canned foods.  I am now giving him low fat filet mignon which is reasonably priced, sirloin, fat removed lamb chops and chicken breast skinless.  He gets some supplements and nourishing chews.  He is learning to eat vegetables slowly but surely.  His coat is much softer and actually shimmers for the first time since we got him!

The shipping is unbelievable.<br />The short grain brown rice is perfectly fine, tastes fine, has nice texture, but it was absolutely nothing special. I've bought short grain rice in the grocery store that tasted the same, but DIDN'T cost me nearly $18 (after shipping) for 3lbs of it. Other vendors' products will seem high priced until you factor in the shipping, and then Barry Farm Foods is kind of a rip-off.<br />It just wasn't worth it at all. I got average product at a crazy price tag.

review/summary: Not worth it
review/text: The rice itself is not bad at all. But there is nothing spectacular about it. This small bag of rice is not worth the price they charge for shipping. Only get it if you have free shipping (7.80 is alot). I thought it would have some type of slightly different taste being organic but whatever. There is not even a huge difference in the production of this brown rice and other short grain brown rices. I would suggest that unless the shipping price goes below $2.25, maybe if shipping was for about $2 with no more than $2.25 for the item, than it would be a nice price. Otherwise, look for a less expensive short grain brown rice because it will have the same health benefits for you and let you buy more with your money.<br />Basically, it's just rice and it is overpriced (suggest you search your local chinese markets or grocery stores a little harder for short grain brown rice, or find one with a better shipping cost).

review/text: Granted this isn't really like apple "butter", but yet again, we're not getting all the fat, calories and sugar that we'd get from real apple butter either.  I tried the strawberry and raspberry fruit spreads, and this was my favorite of the three.  It's not the best thing ever, but is okay for what it is.

review/summary: Fabulous!!!
review/text: I bought this apple butter as a change of pace from my normal peanut butter or laughing cow light cheese spread.  It is absolutely delicious and very healthy.  It's more like a jelly but I am willing to compromise given the nutritional value.  Real apple butter is higher in everything ... calories, fat, sugars, etc.  My next purchase will be a case of it!

review/summary: Imagine Apple Butter Jello
review/text: I had low hopes, I have picked up Walden Farms from a local grocery store and for the most part be underwhelmed with their products because of the cellulose flavor...If you want a nice creamy apple butter that is almost like apple sauce, this is not it. You can tell in the jar that it is thick; but the flavors are on point and no cellulose flavor. I started eating it with a spoon out of the jar...cause you know that is healthy. The one draw back is that it gives me gas, a common thing with sugar replacements. I will buy again for sure!

review/summary: Tastes really good considering ZERO calories
review/text: If you're looking for an exact replica of that buttery sweet taste and texture of fresh apple butter then this isn't it.  If you're looking for a good tasting ZERO calorie snack then this IS it.  The texture is like loose, chunky jello.  I take a whisk and stir it really well until it's smooth.  Spread it on a 30 calorie rye cracker and you've got a filling snack that tastes like dessert.  If you really want a smooth texture then use the food processor.

review/text: Sent this as a Mother's Day gift. The lady who received it thought it was wonderful. The 3 decorative oval boxes can be reused. They contain a variety of sweets & goodies that taste good and last a while. Although I had it "gift wrapped" by Amazon, you don't need to do that because the original gift packaging is already decoratively designed without the need for additional wrapping. All in all, a nice gift for a lady with a sweet tooth.<br /><br />A previous reviewer mentions a "watering can" which is NOT part of this gift; this food gift tower comes in 3 graduated size oval hatbox-style containers, not a watering can.

Being our family Grand Dam a compliment is definitely earned. The package was delivered on time and secured nicely. She commented on the beauty of the gift wrap. The three hat boxes were study, well made and of good quality. She said she felt like a kid at Christmas. Each hat box had a number of treats that thrilled her to no end. Each was a surprise. When all of the edibles were gone she felt that the hat boxes were beautiful enough to be placed in the family room. They are now being used as storage. She is still talking about it. Thank you Amazon and Art of Appreciation. There will be more purchases in the future.

review/summary: Worth the Wait
review/text: It took quite a while for me to finally receive the huacatay paste. It took eight days to process the order and another seven to ship it. Given the timeframe for standard shipping, I think they could have processed the order a little faster.<br /><br />The huacatay paste is good quality. It would be nice if the description here on Amazon listed everything else that was in it (salt and preservatives, mainly). There's about 100mg sodium per tsp, so you'll want to adjust the salt in your recipes. Barry Farms should list this kind of information for their other products. I noticed some reviewers were surprised to find their dried fruits were preserved with sugar. I know this kind of stuff is common sense, but not everyone wants sugary dried fruits.<br /><br />I can't wait to start using this. Each jar is about a cup of paste, so it will last me a while. Given how long the order took, I'd recommend ordering several jars at once if you use huacatay frequently.

review/summary: Do you love a Chai Latte?
review/text: I'm a big fan of Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf's Chai Latte.  With their process, you can actually taste the spice of this particular tea, and the added steamed latte mellows the whole thing out and is a perfect way to start the day.  (And it is not as sickeningly sweet as the beverage made by their major competition.)  But it can be over a four dollar a day habit, which I'm not willing to spend.  So I bought a 3-pack of the tea bags along with the Coffee Bean and Tea Leave vanilla powder and I make my own.  YUM!  It's also fun to make this for guests...always a big hit.

review/summary: Great taste at an excellent value
review/text: I went looking for this pasta after I recently tried a dish at a restaurant recently that featured this form of pasta.  The local regular supermarkets did not carry this kind of pasta and it seemed a bit overpriced at the local exotic markets.  I turned to Amazon to find a great deal.  Since there were no reviews on this pasta I took a leap of faith.  Having had the pasta a few times now I am excited to say that this is an excellent product and is worth purchasing at Amazon.  I am now inclined to try the other pasta's from the same brand.  I have tried it with both salt added and no salt added to the water and they turn out great both ways.  It depends on how you plan to cook the sauce I guess but the pasta itself is versatile and very easy to cook.  Just follow the instructions. I used a large 12qt pasta pot to make it and it worked out great.

review/text: This is the best commercially available beef jerky around. It's drier than most products out there (Pemican, Jack Daniels) and much more authentic. Sadly, it seems that Trader Joe's has stopped carying it and started using their own, inferior brand. Honestly, it'g going to reduce the number of trips I make to trader joe's by 1/2. Anyway, if you like authentic beef jerkey (like the kind you used to find in the glass jars at gas stations) this is the only brand for you!

review/summary: Great Jerky
review/text: I can't claim that this is the best tasting Jerky for anyone since everyone has their own opinion/tastes, but I am not afraid to admit that I buy beef Jerky anytime I see it within reach.<br /><br />Been a huge fan of beef jerky since I was a little kid since I was on plenty of road trips from New Mexico to Colorado because of family.  Jerky was the perfect snack.  From 20 years ago to now, I always have had a passion for Jerky and never surprised by any Jerky until this came around.<br /><br />Was only able to find this Jerky in my company's cafeteria.  Then they stopped carrying it and immediately looked online to find it.  Yes it might be expensive, but its totaly worth it.  Even their customer service is great because one time I got a bad package from the cafeteria and reported it on their site.  They ended up sending me 4 fresh packages (all different flavors) to make up for it.<br /><br />This is worth a try if you want something new.  Unfortunately I can't afford to get this all the time.  Maybe its a good thing because I ordered 2 orders of the Jerky (24 packages) and went through it in 3 days.

review/summary: The best beef jerky ever.
review/text: I discovered Snackmasters Beef Jerky almost 10 years ago at BJ's.  They stopped carrying it several years ago and now only stock Slim Jim and Pemmican.  I couldn't find Snackmasters anywhere and tried every other brand of jerky I could find - Jack Link's, Trader Joe's, anything I found.  Nothing compared.  Finally, for Christmas 2008, my wife got me a couple bags of Snackmasters straight from the company and I have to say, it's still the best.  It tastes like what I imagine jerky is supposed to taste like - seasoned, dried beef.  Everything else is soft and greasy; Snackmasters requires a lot of chewing and the flavor is perfect.  I'm glad Amazon is carrying it now.

review/text: We bought the 2.5 oz "original" recipe package for $3.29 at Traders Joe's, and were pleasantly surprised how great tasting this beef jerky was - it's neither too dry nor too soft, it's just right texture. The spices used are very tasty and well balanced, and the outcome is a great tasting "gourmet" product, just like the label says. Lastly, no preservatives is used. Kids would love this product because of the texture and the taste.  This is a great food find and I'm buying more at Amazon to share.
