review/summary: Plump, Delicious, and an Excellent Value
review/text: Product: Traverse Bay Dried Cherries (4pk of 8oz each, 2lbs total)<br /><br />A quick glance though my 100+ oookbook reviews will show I'm no slouch when it comes to global cuisine, and diverse ingredients.  This product (both the cherries and the blueberries) marked the very first instance where I  bought a dried fruit product online, and was not disappointed.<br /><br />The cherries are all evenly ripe, tart, plump, deeply flavorful, and only lightly sweetened.  They also have a very light coating of oil to seal in their moisture, and prevent clumping.  They're perfect for snacking, and wonderful in oatmeal, muffins and scones.  I've also minced them into sauces, stir fry, and salads, muddled them into lemonade (imparting a pink color and a fruity note), and I also plan to use a few of them to add a subtle nuance to an upcoming homemade mead and a cherry-infused liqueur.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this product, and given that I own a vaccum sealer and plenty of glass jars with universal lids, they should have an excellent shelf life.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Great snack and everything.
review/text: I also wasn't aware first that Amazon has variety of dried fruits and berries to offer. I used to buy dried cherries in Trader Joe for months but wasn't particulary excited about them. I'm on my own diet for cholesterol reduction where both almonds and cherries are playing significant role as powerfull antioxidants. Since fresh cherries available only very limited time during summer, dried cherries became a great alternative. I'm using them everywhere - cereal, oatmeal, bran muffins, cakes, goose stuffing etc... you name it.. Traverse Bay offers very convenient packaging - resealable 8 oz caps. Usually 1 cap is enough for 1-1.5 weeks... Taste is great, they don't even feel like dried, cherries are very moist with incredible texture. Highly recommended.

review/summary: The Best Dried Cherries, Period!!
review/text: I actually live in Michigan and every year head up to Traverse City for the cherry fest. It was during a cherry fest like 6-7 years ago that I was introduced to Traverse Bay dried cherries and cranberries. I have never eaten another brand since. If you like dried fruit then look no further. Traverse Bay sells Dried Cherries, Dried Organic Cherries, Dried Organic Blueberries, Dried Wild Blueberries, Dried Red Raspberries, and Dried Strawberries. Just check out the companies homepage. They even offer subscription based shipping just like Amazon. They also sell a bunch of other stuff as well including antioxidant fruit based vitamins, Jams, fruit concentrates, etc..<br /><br />Dried cherries and dried cranberries are my favorites and I have actually tried a lot of different brands over the years. None of them have the quality, freshness and flavor that Traverse Bay has. I eat them out of the box, on cereal, in salads, and even in homemade ice cream. Dried cherries, or any other dried fruit for that matter, is a great snack.<br /><br />The bottom line - If your looking for high quality dried cherries then look no further. By the way if you love cherries and have never been to the cherry fest in Traverse City then I highly recommend you check it out. Its a great time!!<br /><br />5 Stars!

review/text: If you enjoy dried fruit, do not hesitate. This is an awesome product. Fast shipping. Well packaged. The 8oz plastic tubs the cherries come in are the perfect size to set in a desk drawer so you have a healthy snack at work. Great on the bland oatmeal I'm supposed to eat in the morning. I would consider buying the larger bulk box (cheaper by quantity) and just get a re-sealable container to put them in. Delicious!

review/text: I bought these from amazon because it is cheaper to buy in bulk than to buy expensive little bags from the grocery store. These cherries have the perfect blend of sweetness and tartness and they retained their moisture well. Just a note: they do have added sugar, but I don't have a problem with that. They would probably be great for baking and salads etc. but I just eat them plain and they make a great snack!

review/text: I have been getting these cherries and the dried blueberries from Traverse Bay Fruit Co for over a year.  I actually have a subscription to get the package of 4 containers of cherries and 3 containers of blueberries once a month.  They are sooooo gooood. I have them with oatmeal, cheerios, in salads and just as a snack.  They are not sweetened, but they are very satisfying for the sweet tooth.  Walnuts compliment the dried cherries quite well. I would recommend these good fruit products to anyone who was looking for a snack that was also beneficial to your health.

review/text: I use dried fruit when baking and cherries are my favorite.  These are excellent.  My only complaint would be that they contain a bit more sugar than I desire.  I buy an order twice a year and find they maintain their quality well.  The taste is great.  The fruit stays moist and juicy.  It works well for making sauces and added to salads.  I will continue to order them through Amazon's subscribe and save program as I think they are a good deal.

review/summary: Buy These- NOW!
review/text: Wow. My husband and I are speechless. He is a huge dried cherry fan & we spend our lives trying to find The Kind. They are always in small bags, expensive, pitted, or just gross. To say the least, I'm not a fan in general of dried cherries. I decided to search dried cherries on amazon a few weeks ago and went through all the reviews for each kind. The reviews for this item were all super great, so I figured- why not? They weren't that expensive.<br /><br />Then we got them. Now, they are gone. OMG THEY ARE SO DELICIOUS. I actually ate more than my husband, he was pissed (lovingly so). I don't even like dried cherries- but these are SO good! If kids delicious fun-fruit snacks had a baby with oversized super plump raisins- this would be the demi-god child.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- I've never tasted anything SO DELICIOUS for a dried fruit, my husband agrees<br />- Sweetened enough to be "sweet" but bland enough to know it's a healthy dried fruit<br />- No Pits found in any of our containers so far (and we've had a ton)<br />- Nice packaging, four small little stackable containers<br />- Good arrival time & packaging<br />- GREAT price<br /><br />Cons:<br />- We are going to eat so much that we will either turn into a dried cherry... or... end up hating them forever because we are stuffing our faces full.<br />- You are still reading this and not clicking Buy Item haha

review/summary: Wonderful---the best I've had!
review/text: I love dried fruit, and eat a lot of it. I have found cherries to be a bit tricky to find in a reasonable price and not be overly sweetened or overly dried or just plain mushy. The good reviews of others on the site spurred me to try this product and I am glad to say that I am now a devotee...<br />The cherries come in small enough containers to cart around if I need to take a snack with me, and the quality of the dried fruit is the best I've had of cherries in a long time. They are just the right amount of 'dry' and just the right level of 'tart' and just the perfect sweet treat.<br />I eat them as is, but I also added them to cereal, yogurt, muffins, and scones. They are AMAZING with vanilla icecream, and are just plain lovely in an orange-pound-cake that I recently made for the holidays. Everyone commented on the cherries in the pastry and asked for more.<br />The price of the two pounds total (four tabs of 8oz each) is also very reasonable as far as dried fruit in general, and cherries in particular. This is a keeper.<br />I will be getting more of those, that's for sure!

review/text: Best dried cherries I have found so far. Arrived in good condition. Not too dry, not too sweet not too tart.  Great for bread baking. Note that Traverse soaks the cherries in a sugar solution so they are considerably sweeter  than unsweetened dried cherries. From what I call tell from websites selling unsweetened cherries the impact on calories is negligible.

review/text: I like the clean sweet flavor of this coconut juice. No off flavor aftertaste. I've probably tried 90% of all coconut waters commercially available in the United States. I usually rate them by garbage, bad, okay, and superior. This coconut water would fall under the superior category. Note, pulp means there's small soft easily swallowed pieces of coconut floating throughout the beverage. The first time I tried pulp it took some getting used to. Now I like drinking pulp but if you've never tried it I would not recommend starting out with a case.

review/text: We had received the Anthon Berg 64 piece Chocolate Liqueurs with Original Spirits as a gift for Christmas 2008.  When I saw these on Amazon I ordered them for my mother right away (for Christmas 2009).  The price was very competitive, best I'd seen actually, and we already knew the chocolates were superb.  Well, there was a problem with almost all of the chocolates arriving damaged which dries them out.  I made a remark on Amazon and the Candy Shoppe contacted me to get in touch with them.  I'd like to mention that The Candy Shoppe was professional, polite and cheerful, explaining to me that in an effort to be more "green" they were working out issues finding suitable packaging. That's understandable and commendable. What was even more impressive was that they had my replacement order packed and shipping WHILE I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THEM.  The chocolates arrived undamaged and as delicious as we remembered them. We will most definitely be buying from them again in the future when we are looking for this wonderful product.

While it does include the Cointreau, the Grand Marnier, the Cutty Sark, the Jack Daniels', and the Galliano, the other three are different than what is described. The description says the other three are Danzka Cranberyraz Vodka, Drambuie, and Borghetti, but instead they are Sauza Tequila Gold, Malibu Caribbean Rum, and Southern Comfort. Just be aware.<br /><br />Updated 1/1/11: We ate some of these last night, trying the Galliano, the Cointreau, the Grand Marnier, and the Malibu Caribbean Rum. The foil on the bottles looks great and is easy to remove without looking cheap. Tiny and adorable. The bottles are made with a very smooth and delicious dark chocolate which I really enjoyed, almost needed some milk to wash that down. I spilled just a little of the liquor when I got to that part of the bottle, but my husband didn't spill anything, so it's not a constant. I loved the Galliano and Grand Marnier chocolates; the flavors of the liqueurs went great with the chocolate and the Galliano was only a little boozy. My husband liked the Malibu Caribbean Rum, but found the Cointreau to be a bit too strongly boozy for his tastes.<br /><br />Love these, would absolutely buy again.

review/text: I ordered these for our family Christmas celebration after reading other positive reviews - and they are great! The similar chocolates I ordered year before last were okay but the Anton Berg chocolates were "gourmet".  You can actually taste, and discern, the liqueurs in each one and the chocolate alone is delicious. I was especially pleased at the quantity as well as the quality for the money.

review/summary: Nice novelty gift, mostly chocolate
review/text: I will confess I didn't read the description closely enough before I ordered these.  I was under the impression I was getting plastic bottles filled with chocolate liquor.  What I actually got was chocolate bottles filled with non-chocolate liquor.  No big deal, I am still happy with the purchase and my girlfriend's mother loved these.  They were a big hit during the holidays this year.<br /><br />Be aware though that the product is mostly chocolate, with a little bit of liquor inside.  It's enough liquor just to give you a taste of it - which is to say it isn't very strong.  You would get a sugar high long before you got tipsy off of these.<br /><br />Overall a nice novelty gift, though I wish they had a bit a little more liquor and a little less chocolate.

review/summary: My mom loved these!
review/text: The price was great, and my mom loved them for her birthday. Her friends actually told her she shouldn't be eating them because they were too pretty. lol. I didn't see them myself since she lives out of state, but she thought they were very expensive. And she said they tasted great.<br /><br />One note, my mom just assumed it was from me. I did mark it as a gift, and they didn't include the price on the box. So that was good, but it didn't have my name on it anywhere and they don't give you the option to write a little note.<br /><br />They gave me a 5 day window for delivery. It got there 2 days earlier than the last day on the window, which happened to be exactly on her birthday. So I was very happy.

review/summary: Lacking of a proper product description
review/text: I specifically bought this set due to the description saying there were Drambuie filled chocolates. Being as that is a favorite of a good friend of mine, and I will be at his house for thanksgiving. It was very disappointing to find that the actual assortment varies. I also bought a separate assortment with Malibu, just to find that it was already in this one.<br /><br />Now I will have to mail sellers and ask them what assortment they have prior to ordering, as silly as that sounds. I tried mailing JollyCandy and politely explaining my misfortune. I asked if I could buy a second box possibly with a different assortment, including Drambuie. They only took the time to send back a very rehearsed list of what their assortment was, referring to me as "Dear Customer", and not even taking the time to apologize or even acknowledge my question. I guess since I wasn't "Mad", there was no reason for consolation.<br /><br />As for the actual chocolates inside, they are pretty good, as good or better then I remember them a few years ago.

review/text: I have enjoyed this product and it has been a big hit whenever I take it to a party.  The only problem I have had is that sometimes when you peel the foil off, the chocolate bottle will break and all the good stuff runs all over the place.  My suggestion is that when you open one do it over a sink or something like that because it can be very messy.

review/summary: Anthon Berg Liquor Filled Chocolate Bottles
review/text: I have bought these for the last several years at Costco. This last time I bought 4 boxes of 64. They were $16.59 + tax.  I preferred the other brand that comes in a gold colored box a bit better, but for the price I will settle for the Anthon Berg. I like to freeze them and then take out whatever amount I want and eat them.  Costco started to tax them this year due to the state because of the liquor content in them.  One would have to eat a whole box to get drunk and one would get sick before they got drunk.  These are pretty good and I would recommend them to anybody who has a yen for them.

review/summary: Anthon Berg Chocolate Liqueurs bottles
review/text: I love chocolate liqueurs but I had never tried this brand before - well, it is exceptional.  The bottles are a little larger than others I have tried and the liqueur inside the bottle is real, not just some sugary mixture.  I had a bottle of Cutty Sark, and that little bit, I can tell had the real stuff, and the chocolate is excellent.<br /><br />I will say though that the packaging was not the best and it arrived a little damaged.  Since it is for myself, I do not mind, but if it was to be a gift, it would be a little bit of a problem.  I had to tape the corners and replace the bottles that were not inline.  But over all, it's just a wonderful product.

review/text: After reading the reviews, research with the company that makes this, and asking people about them. I ordere two. They are both being used as Secret Santa gifts and one has already had 20 people bribing the person who one for it. Seeing that reaction<br />for myself tempts me to order another, which I might do at a later date. It has liquors from all over the world, which many people never get to try. Sure they are small, but liquor from another country tends to cost much more.<br />The price was reasonable, but not the amount of liquor for that price. It is a kind of novelty/gift item that is exceptioal over many like it.

review/summary: This stuff is great!
review/text: This seasoning is a tradition in my husband's family and they use it in stuffing at Thanksgiving.  You cook celery and onions and whatever in butter (optional, for flavor) in a frying pan. Add dried bread pieces so that there is more bread than veggies.  Stir that up.  Stir in the Bell's Seasoning.  Add a little boiling water to make it just moist.  Stir in salt and pepper, if desired. Put the stuffing in a pan (9x13 for large crowd) and cook it in the oven for about 20 min or so at 375 degrees until the top of the bread is toasted.  That's all there is to it! Yum!

review/summary: The Best
review/text: My family has been using this seasoning for over 40 years. I am from the North and it is hard to find here in the South. It is the perfect blend for stuffing and I use it for others items. People love everything I cook (I have actually stopped cooking because I had too many uninvited guests), but they are always begging for my recipes, which I never share and this is one of my secrets. I buy if directly from the manufacturer. Since, I don't need 24 at one time.

review/text: My daughter does not like sweets and I don't like foods high in sugar so this works out for both of us. My daughter loves the taste and texture, lightly sweet, soft and much less chewy than Rice Krispies treats. I tried one and loved it too. They are kind of pricey compared to other brands but they are definitely worth the price. Target has them for $3.69, a little less than Amazon but you have to make the trip there.

review/summary: Small but tasty
review/text: I don't think my kids have met an Annie's product that they don't like. This is another winner, as far as they are concerned.  The bars are rather on the small side, so be forewarned of that. They are definitely smaller than your basic Quaker granola bar. I actually prefer a smaller size in most cases. These are a bit too sweet for my taste, but they only have 6 grams of sugar. My kids have NO problem with how sweet they are, of course. The ingredients make me happy:<br />Organic Toasted Whole Oats (Organic Whole Oats, Organic Cane Syrup, Organic Expeller Pressed Sunflower Oil), Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Organic Fair Trade Chocolate Chips (Organic Cane Sugar, Organic Chocolate Liquor, Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Vanilla), Organic Rice Crisp (Organic Rice Flour, Organic Cane Sugar), Organic Palm Oil, Organic Tapioca Starch, Natural Vanilla Flavor.<br /><br />Yay for natural snacks!

review/text: These are amazing, they taste so wonderful and are the perfect snack.  The taste is way way way better then any quaker granola bar that I have ever had.  The perfect ratio of oats, chocolate, and sweetness.  The chocolate actually tastes like chocolate, its so creamy and rich with every chocolate morsel your tongue comes across.  They are also a healthy altervative to most snacks people choose to consume when on the go or when cravings kick in. They are very chewy and you can actually taste the oat flavor unlike most granola bars you taste nothing but sugar.  They are the perfect fix for when you are craving something sweet, so satisfying and enjoyable.  With them being the size of the 90 calorie granola bars by quaker.

review/summary: highly processed - high sugar - low taste
review/text: These bars are very inexpensive for an 'organic' product. I tried one box of them and was very glad I didn't buy any more!  Even my husband who eats anything complained that they don't have much taste!<br /><br />As stated by others, they are small, which is probably a good thing considering the high percentage of sweeteners and various fats and oils that they contain.  The only whole grain in them is the oats, which has been treated and highly processed.<br /><br />Following is a list of the ingredients (the words that seem misspelled are cut and pasted from what seems to be a photo of the actual box label ingredients list on another web site):<br /><br />Organic toasted whole oates (organic whole oats, organic cane syrup, organic expeller pressed sunflower oil), organic brown rice syrup, organic fair trade chocolate chips (organic cane sugar, organic chocholate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic vanilla), organic rice crisp (organic rice flour, organic cane sugar), organic palm oil, organic tapioca starch, natural vanilla flavor.<br /><br />ALSO - note that the last ingredient, "natural vanilla flavor" is not organic and is probably not even natural since most "natural" flavors now come from a chemical factory.

review/summary: So so good!
review/text: The are absolutely delicious, I love every one of their flavors including this one. I ordered directly from annie's site after finding out Kashi uses gmo soy in their granola bars.<br /><br />My criteria for granola needs to be 6 g sugar or less per bar, non-gmo and wholesome ingredients, and affordable. Annie's was the only one on the market to deliver all three (and I really scoured the internet and health food stores comparing many, many brands - which either had too much sugar, were not gmo free, or were healthy but ridiculously expensive). I am thrilled that they taste so good too, beside meeting my needs.<br /><br />The boxes I received were chewy, fresh, and have a real dense quality about them. Just the right amount of chocolate flavor and chips. Perfect for a snack - I often have it with fruit and cheese - I have never found any brand granola bar on it's own to suffice anyhow. In comparison kashi's were larger, drier and felt somewhat like eating flavored cardboard at times in comparison to these. FYI the reviews that state these are small - yes they are skinny, but they are dense, and only 20 calories less than most other brands, which is not much. This is my first time ordering from amazon subscribe and save so we'll see if the quality is consistent - hope so!<br /><br />*** Update:<br /><br />I am sorry to say that there is indeed a quality control issue with these. I will be making my next purchase directly from annie's (like I did my first time), which I hate to do because I prefer the subscribe and save program. The bars are noticeably less fresh, and some bars aren't even complete! I wonder, does this company pinch pennies a little too much, or have quality control problems? I hate to think they send their '2nd rate' boxes over to amazon. Really too bad.

review/summary: These are exactly what a treat should be
review/text: I'm not super strict about what my 3 year old eats, but I keep it healthy and watch moderation while still letting her have some fun and be a kid.  She loves these granola bars.  Her father thinks they taste like cardboard because they don't have a ton of sugar.  I agree that they are not worth the calories for me.  However, that little girl is forever thrilled to get her "bunny bar" if we are out and about and long for the next meal.  So I buy them.  She has not burned out on them yet, after a year. At the grocery store, we find one in every box is stale. Not so with the amazon boxes. Cost is about the same, so I buy them from amazon subscription we we always have them and they are fresh.

review/text: I read all the previous reviews about the taste and do not agree. I like these. I don't care for overly sweet treats. The bars I bought from Whole Foods were not hard or with open wrappers unlike other reviewers stated. My 3 year old just picks the chocolate chips out and eats them leaving most the of the bar untouched which I finish off. At this age she prefers Annie's cookie grahams over these. Previously we tried Envirokids Organic Krispy Rice Chocolate bars which she didn't like but I loved however all the recent reports of lead levels in rice concerned me. So we were happy to see these from Annie's. I think if parents want a big gooey sweet snack for their children they should look elsewhere and then maybe reevaluate what they are feeding their kids in the first place.

review/text: I usually have a box of granola bars in the car for after school activities, just to tide the kids over until we all get home and can have a better snack or dinner.  I wanted something with less sugar so got these, thinking they would be more "wholesome" or something, or at the very least less sugary.  The first time my kids unwrapped their bars, the disappointment was palpable.  These things are TINY.  They are also not much more than some oats (maybe) some rice krispy things, and itty bitty chocolate chips, all stuck together with a minimally flavorful sweet stickiness.<br /><br />Considering that I feel like I paid a little more for these compared to other brands on the market, it made these weak little granola bars seem even more pathetic.  I found a good recipe and will be making my own, with some good things included -- like nuts, seeds, and flavor.<br /><br />Plus they come seven to a box.  7.  Really?  I could only divide this box up evenly if I had 7 kids.

Third, they are not like a granola bar.  We just didn't like them.  We didn't taste chocolate or chocolate flavor.  One last thing, the box is WAY too big and is mostly empty.  The bars are quite small.  IF they can improve the taste I would reconsider but never again.  Waste of money.  If you just want to get an organic treat to munch on you might like this but don't buy it thinking its a granola bar.

review/summary: Not as good as expected
review/text: I used these as an additive to my melted chocolate that I was using to cover cake pops and cake bites.  Before, I was just using oil to do the job, which was very successful.  Many different resources said that I needed to try these paramount crystals to help the chocolate hold to the cake pops.  My attempt with these paramount crystals was a near disaster... Several of the pops started to sweat through the chocolate and on others the chocolate cracked, both of which had never happened on the hundreds of cake pops/bites that I had made with oil in the chocolate.  Needless to say, I switched back to oil.
