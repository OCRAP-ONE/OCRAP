review/summary: Quality Millet Flour, reasonable price
review/text: With rare exception, the Amazon site is the most cost-efficient for purchasing gluten-free flours. This BRM Millet Flour is no exception to this! (Plus, it's actually in stock, which can't be said for many of my local stores.) I've used this flour in a recipe for GF fig newtons and now GF flour tortillas. It is terrific to have this in my repertoire so I can add the texture and weight of millet to my baked goods!

review/summary: A favorite from Republic of Tea
review/text: Pineapple Lychee Hibiscus has a very pleasant flavor, fruity and sweet.  It's a pretty light pink color when steeped - it tastes great warm but it's also very refreshing as a cold tea, especially in the summer.  This is a great alternative to juice!<br /><br />Another benefit of this tea is that some sources say that Hibiscus can lower blood pressure!  On another note however, if you have low blood pressure already, then you may not want to consume too much hibiscus in any form... This is just what I've read from multiple online sources - google hibiscus & blood pressure for more information.

Oh, and it also has a gooey center. Always have it in my purse!

review/text: Yehuda hummus is equally as good as the hummus you'd buy in the deli case of your grocery store.  It is a good hummus but I wouldn't rate it outstanding.  It certainly is more convenient to have it on hand than to have to run out to the store in bad weather.  The texture is smooth and the taste is not offensive, actually it is on the bland side if you are a garlic lover.

review/summary: Watery Hummus?!?!?!?
review/text: I typically make my own hummus at home, but this past week for lack of time I bought some Yehuda Hummus in the grocery store here in Panama. The picture on the front of the can looks a lot like what I call Hummus, thick and creamy, full of healthy ingredients.  When I opened the can to eat it I was quite surprised that the "Hummus" was really really watery and looked like it was better suited for drinking than for dipping.  It wouldn't stick on my carrots and you certainly couldn't spread it as nothing would stay on a knife.  I'm not sure if I just received an off batch or if they are trying to get more profits by watering down their hummus, but that was a big disappointment and I would never buy this brand again or recommend it to anyone!

review/summary: It's okay... just okay. And overpriced.
review/text: Not so impressed with this hummus. Then again, I've not been positively impressed with any canned or bottled hummus I've had. My search continues, but for "emergency hummus" to have on hand, choices are slim. I see a business opportunity for someone.<br /><br />Despite the claim of being made in Israel, this hummos reminds me of someone talking in a "Ja'fakin" accent. Taste and ingredients don't really add up.<br /><br />Check out the Ja-fakin' ingredients:<br />Chickpeas, tehina, water. Good so far. Vegetable Oil (Cottonseed and/or Soy) ["what what WHAT?"], Dextrose, salt, "Edible Starch" (huh?), Citric Acid, and "spices".<br /><br />Let's break this down:<br />- No olive oil. They use literally the cheapest edible oil obtainable.<br />- Dextrose. That's potato sugar. What's that in there for?<br />- "Edible" starch? I would hope so! Does the fact that it's edible need to be mentioned? Just what kind of starch? And why is it in there? Clearly a thickener, to stretch their ingredients (saves them $ while they charge you a lot). So they can add more water and fewer chickpeas. As if chickpeas are expensive.<br />- Citric Acid. This is to provide the tartness that LEMON JUICE would normally provide in a "real" recipe.<br />- "Spices". LOL, seriously. They're not keeping any big secrets here! Traditional hummus would call for cumin, and perhaps garlic. Why so vague?<br /><br />Okay, okay. Search for a positive point.<br />Okay: no preservatives. I wouldn't buy a non-perishable hummus with something like sodium benzoate in it. Most of the fresh mass-produced versions do (think the stuff you find in the refrigerated non-frozen section at Costco), and while the fresh variety taste much better, the preservatives really bother me with those.<br /><br />Some might also see as a positive that these cans come with a pull tab and a soft plastic cap to put over the can when you put it in the fridge. I find that wasteful. I now use a Kuhn-Rikon safety can opener, which enables me to put can tops back on, and I also get no sharp edges of the pull tab.<br /><br />To me, Yehuda hummus is noticeably thin. I haven't seen anyone mention this. It will easily run out of the jar if you upend it. By the way, I always open these jars on the bottom, because they're too full to stir (shaking beforehand doesn't help), and getting to eat the thicker hummus first which has settled to the bottom, almost reminds me of eating real hummus &lt;lol>.<br /><br />The taste? Not much taste. The first taste I get is an weird almost peanut buttery flavor (a common ingredient in REALLY fake hummus), though I'm sure it's not and probably has something to do with the kind of tahini they use (I actually have a can of Yehuda tahini too but haven't had the nerve to try it yet). After that, I feel a little tang of the ja-fakin' citric acid. After that, I notice the watery and overly-smooth texture of this hummus. I then notice I don't have much of a chickpea taste. I then feel glad I'm eating hummus at all. I then realize that these cans are too small, and I shouldn't be able to finish a whole one myself in one sitting, even if I do really like hummus and yes I was hungry.<br /><br />I've tried the Wild Garden variety too (in little glass bottles). It was a long time ago, and the ingredients are also ja-fakin, but I think the taste was better, and IIRC it was a little thicker. No preservatives either. Jars are a little bigger than Yehuda cans, and it's cheaper to boot, but not by much. I can't understand why hummus is so expensive, since chickpeas are dirt cheap.<br /><br />Amazon does actually sell a legit bottle hummus in its 'gourmet' section (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J89GR0">"L'Epicurien Chickpea Cream Hummus"</a>), but it's fantasically expensive for what you get. However, its truly legit ingredients read almost like a recipe book: chickpeas 51%, tahini (sesame paste), extra virgin olive oil, sunflower oil, lemons, cider vinegar, garlic, concentrated lemon juice, spices (of which cumin is 0.22%). Looks like someone makes it in their kitchen. I told you there were opportunities with this stuff.<br /><br />I also found some canned "hummos" in the international section of a grocery store which came from an Arab country, like Lebanon or something. Now THAT stuff was not even passable, unlike Yehuda and Wild Garden, which are passable, just not great. I've even tried dry hummus "mix" in desperation, one of those big dry mix names like Fantastic (I don't remember), and that was a disaster, on the lines of my canned Arab hummos, actually worse if that's possible. I do like the Falafel from dry mixes, just not hummus.<br /><br />I've never had a fresh hummus which wasn't better than a non-perishable variety, and that includes the fresh mass-produced stuff at Costco, which is remarkably consistent in flavor and texture, despite them sourcing from different brands. I've also tasted fresh hummus made by a friend, and had hummus in two different restaurants, one a vegan retaurant and another a fancy mediterranean place. So I may not be an expert, but I've been around.<br /><br />My opinion is anyone who thinks this is great hummus, has never had great hummus. Or even "good" hummus. You can't have "great" hummus made with fake, corner-cutting ingredients.<br /><br />For now I plan to go back to Wild Garden for my "emergency hummus" quick fix (yes I keep whole wheat pitas frozen for such occasions!). But I'm still searching! I see Amazon sells a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HP5HX8">Manischewitz brand hummus</a>, but as of this writing it's unavailable. Any other alternatives? Leave me a comment.<br /><br />Oh, if you're in doubt, my hummus philosophy is: don't go with those trukey fancied-up kinds ("roasted red pepper", etc). It's hard to improve on a recipe which is thousands of years old. YMMV. If you're not sure, get the "traditional" kind (Yehuda is at least legit in the sense that they only sell one kind of hummus: "Hummus"! Not "Traditional Flavor", not "Original Flavor", just Hummus!). You also may want to drizzle some olive oil on your serving, too.

The balm is oily, rather than creamy, and a little bit goes a long way. A touch on the fingertips massaged into the hair and scalp gives hair a nice non-frizzy curl. My scalp also didn't get the dry itch it sometimes does. I wouldn't recommend it though, for other than very dry hair as it can get the hair oily if too much is used. Another thing is that it doesn't wash out easily if you find you did use too much.

review/summary: Great for my Taiwanese daughter's skin and good, in small amounts, on my hair
review/text: I didn't get this to use on my daughter's dry skin, but I realized how moisturizing it is - meant for scalp and hair care - and thought, "Perhaps this could solve our dry skin issues?" And it has! I've tried a lot of products since we brought her home from Taiwan, and none have been as effective. I think it would work really well on scaly cradle cap on babies too, since some of the patches of skin I treated on her were kind of like that. I use it about once or twice a week, and it absorbs well, making a HUGE difference in her complexion. In the winter, I'll try it on the areas where I get dry skin - my feet, elbows, knees, and hands.<br /><br />For me - a Caucasian woman - I just use a little on my palms and smoothed through my hair to increase shine and moisture while taming fly aways.

review/text: First of all I find that the perfume on this balm to be a bit too much.  So much that it becomes noticeable to someone near you.  Some people may like the perfume on it, but I did not like it.<br /><br />Next - it leaves the hair sticky feeling.

review/summary: For African American Hair
review/text: My son is biracial and has VERY dry hair.  I had tried the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil and had problems working it into his hair evenly, but not so much with it making his hair greasy (my hands were a different story).  Because of my experience, I knew that this product was designed for African American hair (even though it doesn't state this anywhere on the packaging).<br /><br />I picked up the container and started looking for directions so I'd know how much to use.  No directions at all.  Wonderful.  So, I just scooped out about 1/2 tsp and my first thought was, "This is basically scented Vaseline."  I was able to work it into his hair much better than the oil and it didn't make his hair greasy at all, but remember, his hair is extremely dry.  In about 5 minutes, I couldn't tell I had put anything in.  I've been using it daily it does seem to make his hair a little softer, but I'm afraid to use too much and turn him into a giant grease ball.  So, for a biracial child with very dry hair, this is a decent product.  It's not the best out there, but isn't the worst either.<br /><br />I knocked two stars off my review.  The first was for having no directions on the container.  The second was for not specifying that this is made for African American hair.  I find it very misleading to make the product sound like it can be used for all hair types.

review/summary: Ok if you use it wisely
review/text: In case of any confusion, this is marketed towards ethnic hair as far as a mask.  That being said,  I just have very dry hair, and I've found that it's good as a moisturizer for my ends.  It also adds a lot of shine!  Basically it's vaseline that smells really good.  It makes my hair look a bit greasy at first, but does soak in after a while.  Hope this helps!

Those are the complete instructions for this hair care product.<br /><br />I have a Ph.D., and I'm baffled.<br /><br />I've used it a few times, and I can definitely tell you that you don't want to use too much of it. A tiny (teeny tiny) amount worked best on my hair, though it still felt somewhat greasy.<br /><br />The product does smell good. Since I don't like wasting anything, I'm thinking about using it as a body butter or hand and skin cream.<br /><br />There's plenty in the container, so I'll probably think of other uses before it runs out.

review/summary: What is Nutrium 10?
review/text: I recently tried Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner and I really liked it, so I was excited to try this intense scalp nourishing balm without knowing much about it other than it's the same product line.  When I received it, I was surprised to see that the main ingredients are, Petrolatum, Mineral Oil & Lanolin Wax. Not sure what to do with it, I googled it and found a video saying you should rub it into the scalp, which sounds like a bad idea to me - rubbing petroleum jelly, a sealant, into your scalp. Wouldn't that just clog everything up? I also found the company seems to have mounted a massive blogger campaign so that most of the search results were bloggers who have been given the product to review and are all "hey, they gave me this to review, so you should consider going out and buying it". I was hoping to find just somebody on a forum somewhere talking about the uses they found for the product or something, but no such luck.<br /><br />I finally figured maybe it could help the ends of my hair. I have fine, thin hair that is down past my bra strap and I recently used Color Oops on it four times over the course of about six weeks to try and remove henna buildup and the ends are looking a bit dry and raggedy, but I am loathe to lose any length. I finally caved and cut about an inch off the ends and then after washing and conditioning my hair and letting it dry about halfway I put a little of this balm on my fingers and smoothed it through the last maybe six inches of my hair. Since petroleum jelly is a sealant and the first/main ingredient in the product, I figure this will seal in moisture as well as any conditioner left on my hair from the shower. I've done this a few times now and it works pretty well. I've found that with this on the ends of my hair it curls more easily and the curls last longer than normal.<br /><br />The jar says "Moisture Lock Nutrium 10(tm) With Shea Butter", and I have no idea what that's supposed to mean, but I think they are referring to the last ten ingredients in the tub, the ones that come after "fragrance".<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy this again because 1.) this container will probably last for years! and 2.) I think it's a little pricey for a tub of mostly just Petrolatum, Mineral Oil and Lanolin Wax. Plus Lanolin Wax is a little gross in my opinion. It's a yellow waxy substance secreted by the sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. I have my own sebaceous glands, thanks.

review/summary: Like Using Crisco On My Hair...
review/text: Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intensive Scalp Nourishment Balm may work for some women, but for me it was like using Crisco on my hair.  Described as being able to nourish the scalp deeply and to seal in moisture, Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intensive Scalp Nourishment Balm seemed to be a product that would work well for me.  Regular color "refreshment" and age have dried my hair so that I need a good, deep conditioning product.  Unfortunately, it left my hair greasy, dirty-looking, and weighed down by its residue.<br /><br />My first clue that this was not the product for me should have been the ingredient list - paraffin is the primary component.  Upon opening the jar, I thought that someone had filled it with beeswax that is used as furniture polish and to seal wooden kitchenware. Unfortunately, what the description omitted was that Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intensive Scalp Nourishment Balm was, according to the label, for "Relaxed and Natural" hair.  Had there been more information provided, I would have chosen another product.  Nevertheless, I attempted to use it in hopes that I would get a better result than some of the other reviewers.<br /><br />Women who do use chemical relaxers or have natural hair may find this product useful.  Those whose hair is fine and straight like mine will probably want to avoid Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intensive Scalp Nourishment Balm.<br /><br />Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intensive Scalp Nourishment Balm has a pleasant fragrance.  I discovered it does work well as a hand cream.  I found that just touching my finger tips to the surface and then rubbing my hands together, my skin was smooth and soft.  I believe it may also work well to prevent hangnails and dried cuticles.  For me and despite its alternative usefulness as a hand cream, Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy Ultra Shea Intensive Scalp Nourishment Balm is a one-star product.  If you have relaxed or natural hair, you may rate this product more favorably.

review/summary: CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm
review/text: I did see a lot of people commented this was mainly for black women but I think if you have a dry scalp, like I do, and you use it VERY SPARINGLY.... it works great and doesn't get greasy in your hair but I can see where if you use too much where it would do that. I just put a very small dab, about the size of a dime, in my hand and rubbed it in good into my finger tips and then rubbed my fingers on my scalp and massaged lightly for a minute or so and it really made it feel softer. I am caucasion with almost white hair and it did not make it look like it was somewhat dirty or greasy like gels and other products do.

review/summary: Definitely needs a better instruction/labeling system
review/text: I've been outside a lot this summer and unfortunately burned my scalp a few times (apparently I'm just not all that skilled with the sunscreen).  I've tried several products to get some moisture back into the scalp, and honestly, who doesn't want more full, 'nourished' hair?<br />Upon getting this, I scanned for directions.  Hmm.  Literally one tiny line on the back of the bottle that could not be more unclear.  Shampoo.  Apply.  Then what?  Do you rinse it?  Do you leave it in for a while?  I decided to wash my hair like normal and apply it to still damp hair.  It smelled great going in, but felt very greasy after it dried. I tried washing again, and even after that it was still a bit greasy.  I saw another reviewer had put it in dry hair and washed the next day.  That actually worked better and did seem to leave my hair more moisturized, but it doesn't feel very good walking around with visibly greasy hair waiting for the nightly shower.  I felt like I had to hide my hair under a ball cap at the grocery store.<br />I also was not aware this product was more aimed at African Americans.  Perhaps my problem with the product stems from using it on red hair, I'm not sure.  I again am open to the possibility that I've been misusing it due to the complete and utter lack of direction on the jar...

review/text: There are so many bad reviews for this product.. Part of the problem is no directions on how to use.. I used a tad after the shower, I felt my hair seemed greasy.. used the night before I washed my hair ( I wash my hair every other day ) my hair seems stronger and love the way it smells.. I have thin hair.. I think it does a great job nourishing my scalp when I sleep like other balms claim to do.. So that is how I use now- I like the product- Been using for two weeks- My hair seems fuller.. but will update if any extreme differences..

review/summary: NOT FOR ALL HAIR TYPES --
review/text: Ok, I should have read the reviews prior to selecting this item.  Hopefully, my mistake of not reading the reviews will save you time & money.<br /><br />I have tried several of the Clear shampoo products and they were great.  I have long (middle of my back) thick wavy hair - not too dry but I do experience a dry scalp sometimes - so I thought that a nourishing scalp & Hair Balm sounded great.  However, this product seems to be for ethnic hair.  Needless to say I applied a little to my scalp - I didn't think it was ever going to wash out; my hair still seems greasy/oily a week later.<br /><br />The product advertising needs to be clarified.

review/summary: Amazing multi-use product
review/text: I hesitated ordering this product, but since I often use similar products and conditioners for ethnic hair (I love the Motion leave-in and deep conditioner) I wanted to try it. After a good look at the ingredient list, I've used in in a number of ways, with very good results.  First, it has a pleasant scent, lightly tropical-ish. I gave a friend a manicure, and used it as the cuticle softener. I put it on his soaked nails, used the wet pusher tool to clean and scrape, and then used a damp towel to remove. Then applied a bit on the clean nail and rubbed in as a conditioner. Perfect!<br />I've used in on the very dry ends of my hair, it keeps them from being fly-away. I even rubbed it on my dry feet, put white socks on for a few hours, and boy, I feel like I've just had a spa pedicure!<br />After a shampoo and condition, I put a SMALL amount all through to seal the moisture in. Pretty pleased, just wish it wasn't mainly a petroleum based product.

review/summary: Don't Know About It's Use on Scalp/Hair But.......
review/text: This stuff is great for facial moisturizing!  I have Caucasian hair and my creme rinses do enough to keep my hair and scalp moisturized, besides, no directions came with it to tell me how to use it on my hair.  But the skin on my face no longer produces it's own oils and I am always trying to find a lotion product that goes on smoothly and lasts for a few hours before I have to re-apply it.  This product can be used for that since it has all the ingredients in most facial moisturizers anyway, and you get a LOT of it!  It should last me for about a year if I don't gob it on too thick.  I like to try to always find more than one purpose for an item and this is how I plan on using this product.  It also makes my lips shiny and relieves chapped dryness.<br /><br />Also, I am very sensitive to perfumes and get sick after smelling them for too long.  So far, although this product is lightly scented and I've smeared it on my face, I yet don't feel icky.  Time will tell though....after a couple more hours if I get urpy I'll update this review.

review/summary: Intensely.......Greasy
review/text: For me, the CLEAR product line has been a mixed bag ranging from really nice to not so nice. I received this early this morning and used it before I bathed  This product has given me a problem. There were no instructions for usage so I used this as a pre-treatment. I dampened my hair and applied two quarter sized globs on my hair. I massaged it lightly on the scalp and then combed it through my shoulder length hair. I put a plastic shower cap on and gave it a half hour to absorb. Right now my hair is pretty dry as well as over exposed to sun and salt water. My hair is also straight and extremely fine.<br />I showered and washed my hair. It felt smooth and soft in the shower, however as it started air drying I realized that my hair was seriously greasy. I ended washing it with a clarifying shampoo three times in total to get rid of the greasy consistency. Frankly, I thought I might have to use Dawn (my perennial degreaser) or Tide to get my hair clean. My hair is still over moisturized but presentable at least.<br />I can't recommend this product based on my experience using it.  It is quite possible that it might work better on coarser hair, but it doesn't do it for fine straight hair. I also think it would help if the manufacturer provided instructions for usage.

review/summary: The product works but nobody knows how to use it right due to packing issues.
review/text: Okay, based on a You Tube video that I found, the product is applied post shower and hair drying/styling.  Part the hair in sections. Rub one finger lighly over the product and then apply directly to the SCALP only.  Repeat only over areas of the scalp needing treatment.  Minimal product is needed.  One jar should last quite awhile and, on the areas I've tested, the product does work.<br /><br />I give this product four-stars because it does work but I'm deducting two stars because the packaging developers failed to communicate instructions and caused way too many people stress and damaged hair.<br /><br />Although I do hold the packaging developers accountable for the number of bad reviews, I am dumbfounded at the number of customers who used this product without doing any research as how to properly apply it.<br /><br />A quick web search brings up a video on YouTube that would have eliminated frustration and hair damage.  Not saying that the manufacturer should have neglected to put proper instructions on the jar or attached them somehow. Honestly, what if hair loss was the result of mis-application?  If there is computer access available to leave a review...the same technology would have avoided the situation that caused the negative review.  The negative reviews are justified because of the packaging but why risk the damage when a search engine would have prevented it?  That's all I'm saying.

review/text: I love CLEAR Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy. It's a light scalp balm that nourishes your scalp and it has a pleasant smell. What I love most about it is that you don't need a lot to moisturize your scalp. I must warn you that this balm isn't for all hair types. It seems to be great for people who have thick or permed hair (It says on the jar: Scalp nourishment for relaxed and natural hair). I use this balm after washing my natural styled hair and when I feel my scalp needs moisture, usually once a week. Would highly recommend this balm.

It presume it could be applied to the wet hair as well. It is very concentrated and so a very little amount should be used each time or else would lead to a greasy hair. A rich blend of shea butter and natural oils helps in sealing in moisture(especially for people with dry hair). It makes the hair soft and silky. It is fragrant too.

review/text: I requested this item from Amazon vine with the hopes that I could give it to my sister because she suffers from intense dryness in her hair. Upon trying it out she marveled at the wonderful texture of it and how easily it mixed in her hair. To be quite honest I was expecting a larger vial but I was happy to see that she was pleased with what I had picked out for her. Perhaps in the future they could offer an economy size of this since my sister has extremely long hair almost down to her waist and more product is needed for a full month or so.

review/text: First off, it would be great if there were any directions to go with this product, then maybe everyone wouldn't end up hating it. I used some of this on the ends of my hair since it's been really dry. I have straight, color treated hair and very rarely use hot styling tools, but I think anyone's tresses could use a pick me up and a good dose of moisture. Unfortunately, even though I used sparingly, I was left with my hair looking wet 24/7 for 3 days. I had to wash it at least 5 times if not more with a clarifying shampoo. My hair is now in worse condition then before I used it. Would never, ever use again, especially after reading that the main ingredients are Petrolatum & Mineral Oil. I can make a better hair treatment at home on my own with 100% almond and coconut oil with a little Shea butter mixed in.

review/summary: Crisco for hair.....
review/text: While I liked the Clear oil for scalp therapy, this product wasn't for me. Even though my hair is very thick, wavy & tends to be dry (gets frizzy with humidity) this product was far too heavy and made me feel as if I just coated my hair with Crisco. I tried it on both damp & dry hair & just couldn't get it to work for me. It did have a pleasant scent, that sort of reminded me of how certain sun products smell. But it was clear that it was more intended for ETHNIC hair. It took a few shampoos before I could remove it entirely, my hair feeling greasy in the meantime (and smoke emanating from from flat iron). If you're African American, or have similar hair (Puerto Rican, etc.) this may be the product for you. But for this Native American/Caucasian it didn't work. A better product would be the oil version instead (but use sparingly....a little goes a long way!).

The first product I tried was the shea oil which I loved very much so I was excited to try this Scalp Nourishing Balm. The first thing I noticed was that the balm its self was very thick, like a thick yellow grease but it smelled great. Im not really a fan of grease so I mainly used this on my edges and to moisturize and seal my ends. It also works pretty good on wet or dry hair.But be careful of using to much because I can tell that it can cause alot of build up. Once again,a little goes a long way.

review/summary: For a Very Specific Hair Type
review/text: I was disappointed that there was nothing labeled on this product or in the description (other than the picture, which I still think is deceptive because just showing a picture of a model doesn't necessarily mean that the products are for one hair type)to note that it's specifically for ethnic hair. Furthermore, there are no directions for use whatsoever - no indication of how long it needs to stay on the scalp to work, or whether its a leave-in or rinse out. You'll want to rinse this out regardless. It's just very poorly packaged. There's one line in the fine print that mentions it works for natural or relaxed hair types which clued me in - anyway, I'm lucky my husband tried it first with his shorter hair as if I'd gotten this in mine I'd probably still be crying about it. All this feels like is scented petroleum jelly. Just go stick that in your hair and you'll get the same effect. It's pure grease, it doesn't rinse out, and it stays locked in your hair after a few washes - unless you have a very specific type of hair, please don't waste your money.

review/summary: Clear has a winner!
review/text: I absolutely love this Clear Hair Therapy. It's light enough to not over saturate your hair with oil but heavy enough to provide the proper amount of nourishment for you to feel and see the difference. Since I've gotten it I've started applying it to my hair every night. I can feel the difference in my hair and having a background in hairdressing I can confidently refer this product to friends and family.

review/summary: not for me
review/text: after receiving this product I tried it out. I found it very oily/greasy and hard to wash out. I could not find any instructions on the product itself on how to apply or use it. After reading the Amazon product review I realized it is not for my type of hair. This product is for african - american hair.  I have to read more about Vine offers from now on. I am sure it will be an advantage for my next item I try. I shall  pass this to a friend of mine who can use it.

review/summary: No instructions, unpleasant feel... but good "curl patterns"
review/text: I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9DS">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm, 6.7 Fluid Ounce</a> not realizing, along with many other consumers, that this works for "ethnic" or "natural" (read: coarse) hair.<br /><br />Because my hair IS coarse, and very curly, I figured I'd give it a shot.  (My hair reaches my shoulders when it's dry, or to my bra strap when it's wet; it's VERY curly.) After all, it smells good...<br /><br />... and there are no instructions on the packaging.<br /><br />I came to Amazon to read other reviews, and saw that the lack of instructions annoyed many other consumers.  Ultimately, I gleaned from all the reviews, and I think it worked out OK.<br /><br />I shampooed and rinsed my hair, and wrung out a lot of the extra watter. I ran my fingers over the top of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9DS">CLEAR Nourishing Balm</a>, rubbed my fingers together, combed them through my hair, and repeated. I am used to being very stingy with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Z5YDO4">Jonathan Product Dirt Texturizing Paste(R) 3.35 oz</a>, so this wasn't much of a stretch.  All in all, I don't think I used a quarter of a teaspoon.<br /><br />After about five minutes, I rinsed. It took more doin' to get out the product than regular conditioner would take.  I'd hoped it would be as easy as when I used to use another "ethnic" product, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112TIE0">Queen Helene Cholesterol Cream</a>, but this was far waxier. I did ultimately get it out.<br /><br />I followed with a little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012X6MQA">Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum</a> because it was starting to frizz, and went for a haircut.<br /><br />My hairdresser was less bothered by the waxy finish to my hair than I was, and he saw more "curl pattern" in the back than I could.<br /><br />No one's running fingers through my hair so the waxy feel doesn't much matter, and the overall appearance (with the Paul Mitchell product) and smell are pleasing. No surprising additional breakage. I had hoped that it would cause less frizz, but maybe I need to use it on a more regular basis. (I've been using it for four days.) I don't know if I'd buy it again, and would recommend that any user read reviews written by people with his/her hair type. I'm lucky that I had hair compatible with the product.

review/summary: Messy to use. Like the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil much better
review/text: I tried both this & the CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil in the squirt bottle. The liquid in the squirt bottle worked far better on my hair, was FAR less messy & easier to apply.<br /><br />This product seemed to feel heavier & weighted down my hair much more, giving it a "just out of the pool" look... shiny, but weighted down.<br /><br />If you use this, use VERY little! Although it's hard to do unless you let it warm up & liquefy a bit before using, then you might as well get the lighter, liquid, easier to control formula.<br /><br />Might be OK for an occasional VERY deep treatment, although mayonnaise or oils that you'd eat cost less & are far less messy out of a squirt bottle, which the other product has.<br /><br />Would likely be better for people with thicker strand, very curly hair (afro-american or similar), yet too heavy for my hair.<br /><br />1st two (2) ingredients are petro products, so not my favorite treatment. Has some great ingredients, yet are further down the ingredient list, meaning there is less of them. The liquid hair oil has mineral oil as the 1st ingredient as well, but works well.<br /><br />If you want real natural oils for your hair, I'd suggest food or USP-grade plant oils, such as avocado, sunflower, shea, cocoa butter, palm "oil"(one of my favorites-the semi-solid kind seems to work best on my hair, yet everyone's hair is different,and has different needs, so try different ones out until you find what works best for you) & similar oils/plant materials (some are hard & need to be warmed to use.) Add some vitamin E oil (natural is d-alpha, dl-alpha is made in a lab) & honey can help (& smells nice) as well, although I wouldn't leave it in your hair - give it a good rinse.<br /><br />If you're looking for something to grab quick that does a great job & don't mind the mineral oil, have dry, thinner hair that breaks easy, I'd get the squirt bottle instead here http://www.amazon.com/CLEAR-SCALP-BEAUTY-THERAPY-Nourishing/dp/B007RTR9G0/ref=pd_sbs_bt_1 It works great & is far easier to use.<br /><br />I'm going to keep this for once in a while deep treatment, but for a couple of times a week,this is probably best reserved for afro-american hair & even then, use sparingly.

review/text: I may not have truly understood what I was getting when I selected this, but it was horrible. Thick and greasy and nearly impossible to wash out.<br /><br />I think it may not be meant for my hair type- pretty normal (not oily or too dry) dark caucasian hair. It just didn't seem to do anything other than create a gross icky mess for me.

review/summary: NO Directions and to greasy and heavy
review/text: I could not wait to try this balm, I have fine, thin, long hair and it gets very dry in the summer.  Unfortunately, I used this in the shower and could not for the life of me fine the directions for use on the package!  I put this all over my head and hair and when I tried to rinse it out, it would not come out. I washed my hair with shampoo 4 times afterwards and I still have this grease in my hair.  I would not recommend this product, unless they include directions for use somewhere - but watch out, it might take you many shampoos to get this out of your hair!<br /><br />UPDATE - it is the next day and my hair is SO greasy - I read another reviewers note where they used dish soap, I tried dish soap and liquid hand soap as well as Pantene to wash this out of my hair - it is a bit less but still so thick in my hair - I am just going to keep washing it through out the day (thank goodness it is a weekend!) and try to get as much of this out of my hair that I can.  I have washed my hair over 15 times and it is still thick and heavy on my hair.  This makes me wonder, what ARE the instructions for this product, is it even for your head or hair???

review/summary: How To Review - Axle Grease?
review/text: Some hair can really use this - it goes on like axle grease and is thick and heavy.  Like grease, it is very difficult to fully wash off. It wants to stay in your hair.<br /><br />I know this is a great product for a group of of selective people with very dry and damaged hair. Unfortunately, the packaging and the description on Amazon didn't really tell me that.  Fortunately for me, I read the reviews here before using it so I didn't put too much on my hair.  Yet I still left stains on the pillow from the product.<br /><br />It smells nice and I think this would be a great product for the right person with a specific type of hair.  3 stars because it is intensive - less 2 stars for not clearly stating suggested uses or users.

review/text: This is made to feed your scalp...but of course it gets all over your hair too...so the thing to keep in mind is to VERY LIGHTLY use this product if you do not have the need for serious moisturizing.  It says it spreads easily, believe them.  A lot of good things in this -if- you need the moisture, has shea butter and vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean oil and more.  Just use with care...I was a little over zealous with my application, its VERY greasy and probably is not for most peoples scalps, it really SHOULD have more info from the manufacturer printed on it.

review/text: First of all, there are no directions. I've never seen a product without a label that describes how the product is used.<br /><br />I have very dry hair that is varied in texture, smooth and nearly straight in front but very tightly curled in the back. I need a rich conditioner but this didn't work for me. Using less than a drop the size of a pea, my hair is dark and greasy and icky looking.<br /><br />Others have suggested using this as a body lotion but I'd prefer to use plain coconut oil as it's a natural product and solves many skin ailments.<br /><br />Would not purchase again....

review/text: My wife gave me the lowdown on this stuff.  Apparently there are no directions for use on the package.....or online!!  Mystery Product!!<br />Now don't jump down my throat coz I don't know about these things, but apparently this product is intended for specific.....ethnicities(We're white, by the way, in case that question was really burning at you).  I'll take her word for it, but that fact isn't really specified anywhere in the product description, and this is further solidified by other customer reviews she read online.<br />However, it apparently makes a good skin moisturizer, but you can't shave with it because it "makes a crappy mess".  It smells great too, and currently is being used as a bathroom deodorizer.

review/summary: It is Not that I Don't Like It ...
review/text: It is more that I can't use it. I think if companies are going to send out their products to be reviewed, they should expressly state who their target audience is in their description. I would not have picked this if I had known it was going to be for ethnic hair. My hair is very curly and frizzy at times but not coarse. I didn't even try to use it because I am too afraid to. After reading the reviews here, I am glad that I didn't try to use it. I would hate to go on vacation with greasy hair.<br /><br />It smells delicious and it looks wonderful. It sounds wonderful ... like a scalp massage, but when it is for relaxed or natural hair, I had my doubts. Here is the product description that "sold" me on trying this out:<br /><br />"Category: Hair Care<br /><br />NEW Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy<br />Ultra Shea Intensive Scalp Nourishment Balm. Nourishes the scalp deeply and seals in moisture for soothing for long-lasting scalp dryness relief. Spreads easily for quick absorption. Formulated with Nutrium 10 Moisture Lock system, a rich blend of shea butter and natural oils, including vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm.<br /><br />Discover the right foundation for strong, beautiful hair with New CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY a range of shampoos and conditioners that feed your scalp and give you stronger, more beautiful hair in just 7 days."<br /><br />Nowhere does it say who this product was targeted for. It wasn't till I received the package when I saw it was for "Relaxed and Natural" hair. After reading others' reviews, I have to say that I wouldn't dare try it.<br /><br />It is a lovely product. I just don't have the hair for it.<br /><br />8/3/12

review/summary: Not A Balm
review/text: This is not a "balm". This is hair grease. Those in the ethnic natural hair community will recognize this ingredients list for what it is-terrible:<br /><br />Petrolatum, Mineral Oil, Paraffin, Lanolin Wax, Parfum<br /><br />After these, then the botanical extracts come in. The hair grease formula kills it though. I refuse to use it because it's the same old stuff that has been sold for years and has frankly done nothing for the maintenance of ethnic hair.<br /><br />Had I know what was in it to begin with, I wouldn't have requested it but I'm glad I can expose it for what it is.<br /><br />The term "balm" is totally misleading and as ingredient listing goes, the small amount of herbal extracts in this product is not enough to make up for the grease base.<br /><br />Clear needs to stick with what they know which is obviously not ethnic hair care.

review/summary: This is Hair Grease
review/text: Reading the description, I was expecting a cream moisturizer. It's a light hair grease. It does have some smoothing properties and of course, will make your hair shiny. The fragrance is light and pleasant. As for its promise to give you stronger hair in 7 days, I don't know and probably never will. I use so many products on my hair that I can't attribute any changes to any one. I do like it and depending on price, I'd be willing to buy it again.

review/summary: No instructions, no information, guessing on how to use it!
review/text: The stuff smell great, but resembles Vaseline in thickness. Am I supposed to heat this stuff? Wash my hair and clop it in? Try and get it in my scalp? So I tried to rub it in my scalp. By the time I was done, I could have put on leathers, a T-shirt, rolled a pack of smokes up in the arm, tucked a smoke behind the ear, and time-traveled back to 1955. Total greaser. OK, so I let the stuff stay in my hair while I worked around the house.  About three ours later I took a shower. Shampoo #1. About 25% came out. Shampoo #2. A little more. Figured I would leave it at that.<br /><br />My hair was still "greasy." Next day, my hair looked limp and lifeless, and my scalp was constantly itchy.<br /><br />I'm not sure who this is marketed for. With no information, it's a gamble.  If you need a product for a 1950's Greaser look, you're all set. For my hair (I'm a 50+ white male) it's a waste of time. The product probably works great for the right scalp and hair type, but the marketing manager for this product needs to be fired.

review/summary: Very Very oily
review/text: As a name brand hair-prep from the 50's once said in its advertising - "A Little Dab'll Do Ya!" and this is So true with CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm. I have short hair, so I used only about 3/4 teaspoon of this on my hair -- it spread like oil and covered every strand of hair in seconds. My hair looked ultra oily, almost like I had used Macassar oil.<br /><br />After a decent interval (hours later) I shampooed it all out with CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, and thought I would need to use an extra application of shampoo to get this all out of my hair -- but not so. One shampooing SEEMED to suffice. However, later on in the morning I noticed my hair was STILL greasy amd not behaving like it usually does. So I had to shampoo my hair again, to get out the oil.<br /><br />Although CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm has many SUPERB ingredients (including Argan Oil), which I am sure will contribute to a cleaner, healthier scalp (and hair) this formula is too greasy -- I can only imagine what might have happend had my hair been longer -- or very long. I even tried using it as a face cream -- and it just SAT on my skin for hours -- SO what is this supposed to do for one's scalp, if it just sits on the surface??? I don't see any reason for using this.<br /><br />BUT yes, it does smell GOOD.<br /><br />But as far as using it on my hair -- I plan to use it only occasionally because the greasiness is too much of a bother for me. Sorry.<br /><br />UPDATE August 6, 2012: Well, I hate to say this but this (used very sparingly) makes a GREAT foot cream. It even softened my callusses (wear socks because this is still greasy)

review/summary: Directions would be nice....
review/text: Quite frankly, I'm not sure if I'm using this product correctly. There are NO instructions about how to use this on the package OR Unilever's product website. I put it on, worked it in and rinsed it out, kind of like a conditioner. It's just OK, and seems a little sticky to me and hard to remove. That would seem to make sense since it's three first ingredients are petrolatum (the main ingredient of petroleum jelly), mineral oil (also a petroleum product) and paraffin (another petrolum product that has a wax subset. There are also plant based oils in here, but they come about halfway down the list of ingredients, so I wouldn't call this a "natural" product. It does have a mild, not unpleasant scent...more like this line's shampoo (as opposed to the very strong frangrance of the line's conditioner). Until I figure out how this is to be optimally used (likely have to find where to send an inquiry email), I'm giving this a "just OK" rating.

review/text: OK, I thought this was for balding men. You know, the guys with the bald patch at the top and the frizz around the edges?<br />My boyfriend has a balding issue, and his hair that does grow is coarse and frizzy, and his scalp gets so dry and irritated I thought this was a perfect product for him to try. I use a conditioning balm from biolage that I LOVE, and this, well, looked like it was for guys.<br />So, I handed it to my boyfriend and he said, "Where are the instructions?" and low and behold, THERE ARE NONE!<br />Then he gave me a strange look, opened it up, and said, "It smells good, but I think I am the wrong color to use this." Then it occurred to me, this is for...well, not white boyfriends of uninformed white girls.<br />He did rub some on his scalp, and all it made him was greasy. Maybe he is the wrong color to use this, but it came with NO instructions at all, and none in the description, so it is not MY fault.

It did seem to help me bounce back. I just hate the feeling of putting any kind of goop in my hair. But I've felt worse, and it did seem to help rehydrate my locks and scalp. Kind of acts as a shaping cream, but not super well. Keep a comb or brush with you to break it up.

review/summary: Me too
review/text: It's hard to add to much to a review here other than to join in the choir.  I picked this up because my wife loves trying new hair products, and I always try them with here.  I didn't know anything about this other than the name "Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm" which sounded pretty simple and universal.  Like everyone, when I got it I wasted time scouring the package for directions (Surprise! There are none!) and then just gave it a shot.<br /><br />After reading several of the reviews here, it looks like this is a race-specific product, of which the packaging gives no clue.  Maybe there are some secret code words I am missing, but I have "natural hair" as in the hair on my head is natural.<br /><br />We have two kinds of "natural hair" in my household, and this didn't work for either of them.  My wife (Asian; long hair) gave up after one try and said it was way to greasy.  Me (White guy; short hair) was a little more persistent.  I tried it on dry hair and wet hair and moist hair, but to no avail.  It works pretty good as a hair gel, and is powerful enough to stick my hair straight up. I could have used it during my punk rock days to stand up my Mohawk, but then there is the overpowering scent to go with it. I don't think it will replace my standard hair gel anytime soon.<br /><br />It seems like this is more of a marketing fail than a product fail. It has a pretty specific market and use, and is not as general as the name and packaging would lead you to believe.

review/text: While I have liked the other products in this line, using this was a disaster. My scalp has been itchy, with signs of dandruff, and I thought since the other products were so helpful this would be good as well. Yikes.<br /><br />For starters, there are no directions on the jar so what to do? It's very greasy but I took a handful and rubbed it into my scalp and massaged. So far, so good. I left it on my scalp for the rest of the evening, to give it a chance to work. The horror started when I tried to wash it out. After shampooing it three times, I gave up and just let it dry. The next morning I was a mass of greasy-looking curls. I'll be washing my hair every day until I get rid of this, but I certainly won't try it again.

Seal."<br /><br />Huh?<br /><br />I was clueless, so I called the 800 number at the bottom of the ingredients list, got connected to Customer Service and asked how I was supposed to go about using their product. The rep told me to massage the product into my scalp right AFTER shampooing, while my hair was still wet, then to "pull it through" my hair with my fingers and the result would be not only a healthier scalp, but also shinier hair. What I got was a head of hair that could have easily won auditions for revivals of "Grease,"  "Jersey Boys" and maybe even "West Side Story." Good thing I tried this on a day when I didn't have to be seen in public, as it took four very thorough shampooings  before there was any way I was going to be able to take my head out of the house that day. Anybody here have Travolta's number? 'Cause I've gotta nice big fat jar of stuff with only about a teaspoon's worth gone missing and it's looking for a good home.

review/summary: It's not a Caucasian hair product.
review/text: I too was confused by the label and directions. The Clear Shea line in the gold bottles is intended for ethnic hair. Silver bottle line is for Caucasian type hair.  I too didnt know they had different product lines and thought this was a conditioner treatment but the #1 ingredient is petroleum jelly.  I have very curly dry hair but putting petroleum jelly on is not going to do anything forcme but make my hair look like I put petroleum jelly on it. I know this product has its purpose but it's not made for my hair type. I really can't see how this can nourish any human beings scalp. It's not the fancy ingredients it says it is. It's mostly petroleum jelly.

Give me a break!  To not tell customers the proper way to use your product to achieve the best results is stupid.  Various of these reviews list all the ways that those of us participating in the Amazon Vine program, have experimented in how to use this product.  We should not have to guess at all but we did have to.<br />I for one, will give this product one more try after reading some of the comments listed here...for example using it after a shampoo and towel fry, very scantily and see if I get a better result.  After my shower today I've been walking around like a "greasehead".  Simply cannot wash it out of my hair.  I hate it!

review/summary: Grease!
review/text: Let's start by looking at the list of ingredients: Petrolatum (petroleum jelly), mineral oil, paraffin, lanolin wax, fragrance... So, there's more perfume in here than any magical "nourishment" ingredient, and far more grease than anything else. Even the nourishment ingredients are nearly all oils.<br /><br />This stuff would be great if you want to spike up your hair. Myself, I hate greasy hair and that's what you get when you use it. It is also nearly impossible to wash out, even using Clear's own shampoos.<br /><br />No sir, I don't like it.

I looked all over for directions on how to use this product I even searched online and found nothing so I shampooed and then tried to condition there scalps with this stuff. It was like putting peanut butter in their hair. It felt like vasalen. Once their hair dried it was an oily mess that wouldn't wash out.

review/summary: not sure who could use this product.
review/text: The product description on line that I read, doesn't mention that this is for relaxed and natural hair.  when I got the product, the container says it's for Relaxed and natural hair..  Relaxed to me means curly hair that has been chemically relaxed.  I wouldn't have got this product, had I known that.  Typically, the type of hair that gets straightened is very thick and dry, so this product could be for them.  I would still question even that though, knowing how difficult this stuff is to wash out.<br /><br /> With no instructions with it there's no telling how exactly to use this.  As a former hairstylist, I've seen similar looking products used on straightened hair to help smooth it down with a flat iron, but  It's not advertised to use that way.<br />It's thick and by the other reviewers seems to be very difficult them to wash out too.  Maybe similar to putting vaseline on you hair.  It says for the scalp and hair, but to even get on my scalp, it would get on my hair, so not a product for me.

review/summary: Problems...
review/text: I ordered this because my hair has been puffy, dry and out of control lately. I was looking for something to tame it and bring it back to health. I have used scalp treatments in the past with good success and thought this might get the same type of results.<br /><br />The packaging doesn't list the ingredients on the outside of the label, but the face of the product says, "Shea butter." I don't know why I presumed that meant that this is a natural product because it's not. The first two ingredients are petroleum and mineral oil. Shea butter is number 6 out of 13 ingredients. If you are looking for other unnatural and potentially unsafe ingredients, it also contains perfume. The rest of the ingredients are natural oils (coconut, sunflower, palm, etc).<br /><br />There are no instructions for how to use this. In the past when I've done a scalp treatment, I've used a generous amount on warm, wet hair, massaged into the scalp, coated to the ends of the hair, left on for about 20 minutes and rinsed out. Not sure if this is how it's intended to be used, but I'd guess not. I think this was WAY too much product and left on much too long. You can't get it out. It's greasy and clings forever. After five washings, it still looks the same. I haven't worn braids in years, but that is how you see me today because otherwise you'd see me looking crazy with greasy, stringy, heavy looking hair.<br /><br />The product doesn't say, but I think this is made for African-American hair which I do not have. That would have been good to know in advance. The only other time I used a product made for African-American hair, I had the same results. Oh, wait a minute! Maybe it does indirectly say that it's for African- American hair. The label says, "for relaxed and natural hair." My hair is natural and relaxed, but God made it that way. I didn't think about those terms not applying to me.<br /><br />So my hair is really shiny/greasy- not a good thing in the heat where I am sweating because all the dirt is sticking to it. That's not really what I had in mind. Needless to say, I have big regrets about giving this a go.

review/summary: Instructions? Would it have hurt to put some on this product?
review/text: I am giving this product a two star product review mainly because there are absolutely no instructions on how to use it on the container.<br /><br />I am a caucasian 56 year old female with hair that tends to be dry on the ends and have a sporadically itchy scalp.  I thought this product would help when I saw it advertised on the Vine program.  And it does - if you use it correctly.<br /><br />I was one of the users that thought this was a conditioning product (put on, wash off).  I used way too much and ended up with beyond greasy hair.  It took four washings with Dawn dish detergent and four regular shampooings to get this stuff off my hair.<br /><br />BUT...<br />After all that, I used just a LITTLE bit in the palm of my hand (like less than pea size) on my damp hair.  It gave my hair a very nice sheen and controlled the flyaways.  And it does have a wonderful fragrance.<br /><br />I cannot imagine a manufacturer NOT putting instructions on their product, though.  Yes, this might be for African American hair as other reviewers have pointed out but nowhere in the advertising or on the balm itself does it say that.  So two stars (and I almost gave it one) but I did try a second time, after reading other reviews.

review/text: I began using this product soon after the Clear Scalp & Hair Shampoo and Conditioner. Love those products. Don't like this one.<br /><br />First, it gives you NO CLUE how to use it. Do you use a little? A lot? Do you rinse it? Or is it a leave-in product?<br /><br />The packaging doesn't tell you!<br /><br />After some experimentation and web research, I decided it seems to be a leave-in product.<br /><br />If you use it, which I don't recommend, do so SPARINGLY. It makes just-washed hair look and feel greasy.<br /><br />Given the benefits of the other products in the line, I can't say for sure this one wouldn't be good for your hair. I can only say I couldn't stand using it often enough or long enough to see whether it had any effect.<br /><br />After a couple weeks, I threw it away.

review/summary: Probably for African-American hair
review/text: I was very satisfied with the Clear brand shampoo that I received, but this "scalp and hair beauty therapy" product is way too greasy, and I'm not really sure of its intended purpose. Is it a hair straightener? Is it simply for nourishing the scalp? It's hard to tell since there are no directions. Open the container, however, and dip your finger into the contents and be prepared to spend a bit of time trying to remove the residue. My fingers were greasy, and remained so after scrubbing them with soap. I didn't even consider placing this in my hair.<br /><br />Based on the ad on Amazon that show an African-American woman, I assume this product is for African-American hair. It was surely not for me, hence the rating of one star.

The label says it is for scalp nourishment but I am not sure what that means. I opened up the jar to find a really buttery substance much like vasoline. I put a little on my scalp as I do have a problem with dry skin especially on my scalp but it was so greasy I could not stand it. BOY was I sorry, I could not wash it out fast enough and to my dismay it did not wash out right away and I had to keep washing my hair for a few days before it finally did come out. Needless to say the jar went into the garbage. Do not waste your money! Strangely enough the Clear Shampoo is really good product and I love it. This one is a bust!

review/summary: might makes a nice furniture polish
review/text: I tried this product because it has a lot of things I like and routinely use in it: shea, argan, almond oil, and I am always looking for natural, plant-based products.  It might well make your hair shiny, because it doesn't come out (I have washed my hair twice now... and am off for a third round :(<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical when I put it on, as it has the consistency of wax mixed with petroleum oil.  Thick, so thick it is difficult to apply evenly (or in a thin layer).  It does smell nice, I will give it that, so- there's the 1 star (I could not give it a zero).<br /><br />I used this after I washed my hair last night and it felt greasy, so I washed it again.  It didn't come out.  I washed it again, and went to sleep.  In just a few minutes, I will be washing it again :(  :( and hoping that I can get it out this time, and that it did not ruin the sheets.<br /><br />Consider this review not so much a recommendation as a warning.<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________<br />update: I have now washed my hair 4 times and have not been able to get it all out :( It feels greasy, damp & heavy,  and is getting all over my clothing , sheets.  I would say that this is singularly one of the worst products I have ever used.  I would not even recommend a trial, unless you are willing to live with it.<br /><br />Because of all the nourishing oils, and the consistency, it might make a nice furniture or (wood) floor polish, but unless you like the greaser look, I would not put it on your hair (and am hoping a third wash will get it out of mine).<br /><br />It even made my dog mad! He usually gets walked before I get in the shower, but today he just has to wait.<br />___________________________________________________________________________<br />some hours later... after 6 shampoos (twice by my hair dresser, I came home & tried her recommendation:  Liquid Joy.  Two rises with dish soap got most of it out.  This is being posted for those who tried it and feel like the only way to get it off is to shave their heads (my stylist actually suggested that- laughing :P  If you have not tried it... think seriously about what you are getting yourself into.<br /><br />I read some of the other reviews and it seems maybe it's good for some people with different hair, different issues.  I wish the manufacturer were honest and said that!  I liked my hair before I used this stuff.  Now... I just hope I can get the last of it out.

review/summary: Works for dry and textured hair
review/text: After reading many reviews on this product I had to leave my 2 cents. Reading comprehension is key people, the labeling is just fine but it clearly says on the product "for relaxed and natural hair" which means it is aimed for people who textured, curly or hair that has been chemically altered to be straight...ie the hair that many black and some latina women have. It's amazing how many of you are upset because a product did not cater to your hair type...but its understandable because you're used to everything being for your hair type and skin color. Don't worry though, you've got entire aisle's at drugstores for your hair, I'm quite sure you'll be able to find something else to suit you. Welcome to my world, the world of trial and error when it comes to products for my highly textured hair, its nice to be able to pick up a product designed for my hair type.<br /><br />That being said, the product actually isn't that bad, its much better than the shampoo and conditioner which did not give me enough moisture and left a film on my hair. It left my hair extremely moisturized and not greasy, I didn't even need to apply my coconut oil to my ends for a few days because my hair was just fine. It also smells really good. I will agree with other reviewers that it needs better instructions but as someone who is used to to using these kinds of products, I made it work just fine.

If you have split ends, this will seal in the ends and keep them from drying and splitting more. Just be sure to use so very little. Rub your hands together and smooth through the ends of your hair.

How often should it be used?<br /><br />After finding no answers to my questions, I looked on-line and much to my surprise, others had many of the same concerns. And, like me, some were surprised that this product was meant for the African-American user and not for Caucasian hair.  Even now, looking at the jar, it states "natural hair."  Well, my hair is natural but my L'Oreal shampoo states that it's for fine hair, permed hair, thick hair, etc. but "natural" hair?  I would not recommend this product.

Worse, the ingredients can only be seen if you peel off the back label.  And what do we find as the first ingredient? Petrolatum, a product otherwise known as petroleum jelly.  This malicious product has been found in breast cancer tumors.  Applying directly to the skin inhibits the skin's ability to breathe.  (Do an internet search of Petrolatum and you'll quickly find the same research results.)  Oof, bad.  Once it's in your hair, plan on it staying there through 6 or 8 shampoos (unless, as another reviewer has suggested, you use a detergent on your hair that can unhinge the petroleum molecules).  This product is not recommended for humans or animals.

review/summary: First ingredient: Petroleum Jelly!!!
review/text: This product sounded terrific in the Amazon description, but when I got it I was shocked that the first ingredient listed is Petroleum Jelly.  Seriously!  No wonder so many reviewers have had problems with their hair looking greasy after using this.  I have thin, straight light brown hair and even a tiny amount a vasoline (petroleum jelly) is going to make it look terrible.  And petroleum jelly (made from oil, and not fancy natural oil like jojoba and the like, but the kind of oil that they make gasoline and motor oil from) is going to take a lot of washing to remove from my hair.<br /><br />I was just about to put it on my hair when I happened to glance at the ingredients and I'm so glad I did!  I definitely do not have the kind of hair that would respond well to this product.  I have a lot of friends with thick, dark curly hair so I'll ask around to see if any of them would like it.

review/summary: If I wanted hair this greasy, I just wouldn't wash it!
review/text: I have curly hair; like seriously curly hair. Additionally, it gets all frizzy whenever it's even the least bit humid. I have tried deep cleansers and balms before so I thought that I would take a stab with this one. The first thing I noticed is that the smell was fantastic! I wanted to put a wick in it and burn it like a candle. The second thing I noticed is that it was very greasy to the touch. Previously, I have put balm in my hair while washing and waited 15 minutes or so and then washed it out. Other times, I have only used the products once my hair is clean and dry and I use it to style. I tried both of these ways and ended up with the same disaster on my hands: greasy, gross hair! You might ask why I tried both of these ways and didn't just read the instructions. Funny you should ask! There are no instructions or directions on the container....AT ALL. I looked everywhere and under all of the labels and found nothing.<br /><br />Therefore, I was left on my own to try to figure it out. When I put it in my hair while washing, it took almost a week to get my hair to stop feeling greasy. No matter how many times I wash it, it looked like I had dipped my head in a deep fryer. When I used it for styling, the same problem occurred!<br /><br />Maybe I am from another hair product planet, but all I can say is that you should pass on this product. That being said, I kept mine because I like the smell!

review/summary: Old style product that requires moderation
review/text: This product is advertised as a  "Scalp & Hair Beauty Therapy" and it is. I have a dry scalp and this has been helping. This product seems to not be advertised correctly though it does what it advertises.  Be aware that there are no instructions on its proper use. The oils needed to aid your skin is contained within a petroleum jelly base and this is what you apply. I apply a small dab directly too the scalp after you have dried your hair and I actually avoid getting on my hair as much as possible. If this was the 1950's the 'Greasers' would be using this too slick back their hair. I look at this as a treatment and not a product used all the time. If you get this in your hair it will be like you put petroleum jelly in it and you will have a hard time washing this out.  Note: Though I do not put this on my hair in very small quantities it would add a shine too your hair.

review/summary: Great for horny-toad feet!
review/text: As a Viner, I like to review products that I wouldn't necessarily purchase for myself, and this is one of them (because it's not intended for Caucasian hair). I also like to try to use products in ways they weren't intended for.<br /><br />This stuff is great on my horny-toad feet! (I mean, why not?) I go barefoot all the time, and my feet have been just dreadful, cracked, scaled, just really horrible. I soaked them in soapy water for about ten minutes, rinsed and briskly toweled them off, and then massaged liberal amounts of this intense scalp nourishing balm into them. What a difference! It worked a lot better than other foot treatments I've tried. The oils are pretty quickly absorbed, and my feet smell good, too. It's really quite a luxurious experience.<br /><br />This is a pretty large jar, 3.5" in diameter, so it should last for a while. I like it!

review/summary: It has what in it?
review/text: Omg! Is anyone reading what's in this crap! Mineral oil and petroleum! Two no no's for heathy hair and scalp! What's wrong with these people? That shit clogs the pores on the scalp and hair follicle. Why would anyone looking to maintain hair health use this?

review/summary: Horrible Marketing Leads to Gross Greasy Surfer Girl Look
review/text: My adult daughter's review: From the name and the advertising, it seems that this balm is a deep conditioning treatment for the hair and scalp. The large jar came with no instructions at all on the packaging. Opening it up and seeing the very large amount of thick, sweet-smelling balm filling the jar gave no further clues. What to do? Use a dime sized amount? A handful? Use on wet or dry hair? Leave in or rinse out? Put on the ends of hair only, or over the whole head? Unsure, I dived into the shower and plopped a half of a palmful over my entire head, but concentrated it mainly on the ends of my long straight hair. Instantly, I regretted it. My hair felt like I had completely coated it with Vasoline or Aquaphor, and no amount of rinsing or shampooing could remove it. Once it dried, I had thick greasy strands hanging limply from my head, making me look like a lazy teenaged surfer. Not exactly the look this mother of three generally goes for. I read a ton of magazines and have tried about a million hair products over the years, so the fact that this baffled me is even more indication that DIRECTIONS ARE VITAL. It may be a good product, if used correctly, but who knows what correctly is? I plan to use the rest of the giant tub on smoothing calloused feet and maybe as a flyaway smoother on dry hair.

review/summary: For relaxed or natural hair (African American)
review/text: I see tons of bad reviews on here and I would have to say they are very wrong. This is more so for african american hair. And we need the moisture to keep our hair healthy. We are not washing it everyday and this stays in your hair. That's what we want. I really like this product. You can apply it directly to the scalp or you can put it in your hair and rub on your hair. The smell is lovely. Doesn't smell like old school GREASE! If you want a great product to add to the mix, I would suggest using this.

review/summary: FAR MORE USES, BEST BODY MOISTURE EVER for EVERYONE
review/text: I am amazed how horrible the marketing is on this wonderful product. Whoever designed the label with no instructions should be moved to another department or just fired.<br /><br />In the islands we use coconut oil on our skin hair etc. and this is used in a similar way with truly wonderful results. It is far more then a scalp moisturizer it is fantastic on your whole body! Here is the best way to use this product.<br /><br />Take it with you in the shower and wash as usual. Before drying off lightly touch this product with your wet finger tips (do not dip into it you, just want to lightly rub the surface) and rub it into your hands, you use very little. Then while you are still very wet rub your hands through your hair from scalp to ends. Also use it the same way on your face and body and then towel dry and comb through your hair. You use very little and it leaves your skin and hair like silk. I am caucation with straight fine hair and it leaves my hair silky and shiny and my skin as soft as ever even works great on dry heels! If your hair or body feel greasy you simply used too much.<br /><br />I love this product as a body and hair moisurizer, it's tragic how poorly this is being marketed with no explination whatsoever on what to do with it! Great product with the worst label ever. use a little and you will love it a lot!
