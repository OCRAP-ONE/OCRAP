review/summary: Great pasta!
review/text: I used to eat fresh squid ink pasta when I lived in the Italian Market in S. Philly. I'm now 1300 miles away with no Italian stores or delis. I can't spend minimum $35 for shipping, so I tried this and it's great. Great Halloween meal with vodka or tomato cream sauce. I just made it with scallops. Go for it!

review/summary: Great brand and texture, but...
review/text: I'm a huge fan of Rustichella brand pasta. I buy many shapes, as I love the texture of their pasta. My husband and I are fans of squid ink pasta dishes, so I was excited to see this available on Amazon and at a great price, too. I prepared my favorite restaurant dish using rock shrimp and the pasta and have to say the flavor of the squid ink wasn't there. Just regular spaghetti. Disappointed. Well, I suppose I could buy the squid ink from Spain and add to the sauce for the flavor I'm after since I have three more to go. I won't buy again. I'll keep trying other brands until I find the right one.

review/summary: Scrumptious
review/text: I am Italian and cook often. This was a wonderful pasta. Thick, delicious with a strong yet subtle flavor. It adds a flavor to any seafood dish.It can be eaten on it's own for a more flavorful pasta dish. You don't need to go heavy on the sauce and I would advise against pairing with any grated cheeses. (Italians do not mix fish and pasta dishes with grated cheese as the cheese brings another element of flavor and ruins the subtle taste of the seafood) If you like pasta and squid ink I would buy this.

review/text: I had the black spagueties for the first time in my trip to Merida last May at an Italian Restaurant and I liked them very much.  They prepared it with shrimp scampi.  I tried to buy the spagueties in my area and did not find them anywhere.  I then decided to try amazon and bingo, I found them.  My family loved them when I made them the same way, black spagueties with shrinp scampi.  My son in law look at the dish with a bad face, but when he tried it, he too love the taste.  They are delicious.

review/text: I love the look of black pasta in certain dishes, but this brand also cooks up with excellent texture. You will have to test it periodically as you cook as there is no suggestion for timing. Since timing varies with altitude and the amount of water you use anyway, this is not really a flaw.

review/summary: A constant in the kitchen cabinet!
review/text: When a favorite product goes out of existence, then a cook loses a dear friend. Although the MBT Chicken Broth packets are still available, the Beef Broth cannot be found. My mother and sister-in-law and I devotedly use the MBT products: Chicken broth, Vegetable Broth, and Beef Broth. But guess what? Beef broth is no longer available. Yesterday when I checked Amazon, MBT Beef Broth came up, but I had to add my name to a waiting list when "the product becomes available." Today when I double-checked, there is no MBT Beef Broth.<br /><br />How do we use these products? Like Emeril, we use them to add bam to soups and stews! I make Chicken and Rice or Dumplings or Chicken Vegetable Soup, using white meat only. White meat without skin has little or no fat, thus no flavor for the dish. I add two packets of MBT Chicken Broth for that missing fat and get all the flavor I want. The same is true with Beef Stew. Two packets of MBT Beef Broth add such flavor!!<br /><br />But now, no MBT Beef Broth! Just granules and cubes. They are not the same. I don't know why, but they aren't. Does anyone have a suggestion for a good beef broth substitute? I have looked and looked on Amazon for one, but cannot find a thing. Help?

review/summary: MBT Chicken Broth
review/text: MBT Chicken Broth is the best cup of broth available.  I add a teaspoon of half and half and have a wonderfully tasting cup of soup.  I have been using it for years -- then I could no longer find it in any store around me.  Called the company and they gave me the name of a store hours away. Have been having MBT withdrawals when I finally found it at Amazon at a great price -- way cheaper then some other on-line stores.  My friends and I share the price of the case but if they didn't -- I would purchase it for myself.  This broth has a taste all its own and is great added to homemade soups and gravies.  Salt content is a little high but I don't have a problem with that since the broth itself is only 5 calories.  I have only used the chicken and have not tried the beef broth.  Great to take traveling for that afternoon pick-up.

review/summary: GREAT TASTING alternative to toxic water flavorings with artificial sweetner
review/text: I never really review things that much but I had to review this. These are GREAT, and the are convenient just pour and go just like the Propel packs I used to add to water (I can't drink plain water it's gross) but Propel is so bad for you b/c it uses Splenda in it (sucralose) an artificial sweetner. This is natural and tastes great, even better than Propel did. When I had my first sip I was thinking of giving it 4 stars, because it tasted great- BUT it did have an after taste AT FIRST. However, DONT GIVE UP!! As I continued to drink more of it the aftertaste faded away, I think it's just your taste buds reaction to trying something new. It really tasted like Kool-Aid it was really great. This is definitely something I will order again and am getting used to and is SOO much better for you than stuff with artificial sweeteners!! The after taste will go away as you get used to it! And think about it, ALL no/ low calorie drinks have an after taste, I wonder if it's the body's reaction to being fooled! But this is great stuff, give it a try and you won't go back to other stuff, especially knowing how much better this is for you. And for other reviewers that said it was clumpy--- don't be a lazy bottle shaker and you won't have a problem!!

review/summary: The classic!
review/text: Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation." Oscar Wilde.

review/text: In case you have never tried these, they are incredible with a high content of both caffiene and theobromine. Eating a full nut will make your brow sweat.... Literally.<br />These nuts only got 4 stars because they arrived a little past their best, but they really aren't bad at all!

review/summary: mix for delicious gluten-free pancakes
review/text: One tradition in my  family has always been  my husband's Sunday morning pancakes. When he was diagnosed with celiac disease and had to eliminate wheat gluten, we were  dismayed. However, the pancakes my husband  now makes using Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake mix are MUCH BETTER than the ones he used to make with Aunt Jemima's Buttermilk Pancake mix. In contrast to other gluten-free pancake mixes, which are mainly rice flour, Pamela's has a high percentage of almond flour and has a delicious flavor. We especially like to mash a ripe banana with the pancake batter to make almond-banana pancakes.

Try some of the other items from Pamela's line, the prebaked boxes of shortbread and chocolate chip cookies are wonderful too.

review/summary: Soft and  Delicious Bread, not Dense or Hard....
review/text: I am excited about Amazon.com having Gluten Free selections. We order on Amazon so it was fun to find things I enjoyed.<br /><br />This Christmas I received Pamela's Bread Mix. I absolutely loved the bread and it was made in our bread maker. The package already had the yeast in it so it was very convenient and easy. I was able to slice up the bread and put it in the freezer to preserve it for when it is needed.<br /><br />We recommend Pamela's Products to everyone whether they are gluten free or not. I have been gluten free for over 4 years. I could never make a great and tasty bread until now. This bread is soft and easy to slice. The best part is not having to toast it to taste better. I love having sandwiches so this was also the best part of this Christmas gift.<br /><br />A special thank you for Pamela's Products.... Being gluten free is less stressful with more enjoyable times in the kitchen. We are a gluten free home and they don't even realize it most of the time.

review/text: I've used this in a number of recipes to make them gluten-free.  I've had really good luck , especially in moist, flavorful baked goods like banana bars and pumpkin bars.  Definitely a good option for those who don't want to buy 10 different kinds of flours to mix to make one recipe.  That's been me, though I'm starting to experiment a little more lately.

review/text: My daughter has Celiac's disease so I purchased this product to use as a substitute for Bisquick baking mix.  It wasn't as easy as I hoped to mix up with the Crisco for the recipe I was using it for (an impossible pie).  However, once I was able to finally mix it together with the other ingredients it turned out fairly well and we all enjoyed the ham and swiss pie.  Have not had the opportunity to use it for other baking uses as of yet.

review/text: Pamela's pancake mix is the basis for the best pancakes you'll ever eat. Although I'm a celiac I've served these pancakes proudly to many others who agree they are better than wheat-based pancakes. I'd bet it's the almond flour that makes them taste so good.<br /><br />These pancakes require slower cooking than regular pancakes, but the flavor is better. Some have commented they don't get that "rocks in the belly" feeling from eating these.

review/summary: Didn't Live Up To The Hype...
review/text: I purchased this based on reviews here on Amazon. Big Mistake!!! As soon as I received my shipment I went online to the Pamela's Products website and printed out recipes. So far I have tried 3 recipes and none of them have turned out even close to what they were supposed to be! I followed them to the letter and nada!<br /><br />First recipe was "Cut Biscuits". Turns out that their recipe for "Drop Biscuits" and "Cut Biscuits" is exactly the same and very runny. I decided to make "Drop Biscuits" instead because the batter was so runny and they didn't even rise. All I ended up with was some hard lumps on a cookie sheet that were dry.<br /><br />Next I printed the "No Yeast By Hand Bread Loaf Recipe". That didn't rise either and it came out the consistency of cornbread not like any kind of bread that you could actually make a grilled sandwich with or toast as the website claims.<br /><br />Ever the glutton for punishment, I decided to try the "Bread Machine With Yeast Recipe" from the website. I tried it twice on two different settings. First I tried the "One Rise Rapid Cycle" for gluten free bread and then I tried the "Normal Cycle" for white bread as the website says and they both "fell" (collapsed in the middle) shortly after the baking cycle started!!!<br /><br />I have now wasted money, eggs, olive oil, several yeast packets, time etc. and all I have to show for it is 4 1/2 bags of useless flour that isn't working with the recipes provided by the company that made it and I don't know how to use it for anything else. I had previously purchased products from "Gluten Free Pantry" and I never had any problems with their products.<br /><br />I only purchased this because of the reviews and because I could get it in bulk on Amazon for a better price. I will certainly be canceling my subscription for this product. Lesson learned, knowledge acquired...<br /><br />***Addendum: I decided to request a call from Amazon to let them know that the product may be defective because it was not performing correctly and to my surprise they offered me a full refund!!! I wasn't expecting that! And to think that I nearly decided to just let it go and chalk it up to experience. Thank God and Cheers to Amazon!!!

review/summary: Great tasting... But beware of calories and fat
review/text: Pancakes are good and do not taste like they are missing the glu. I made some drop biscuits using this mix and they were better than bisquick. However, I figured that each biscuit is at least 200 calories and over 7 grams of fat per biscuit. Aaah, now I know why I wanted to eat so many of them. My doctor says to try gluten free, as I have had an unexplained leg rash for many years now. My gluten test was negative, but I was told, that I could still be gluten sensitive. So, I am trying to cut it from my diet. Problem is, I also need to cut calories. I can't see eating Pamelas products regularly... As I will likely balloon even larger than I am now. But, when I must have bread or baked goods or go insane, these products fit the bill. The drop biscuits were extremely good. I think I will make them for the holidays...just make them smaller, and maybe add some cheese and spices to replicate Those Red Lobster biscuits that I love. The recipe for Pamelas diner drop biscuits are on the web. I used butter instead of shortening, and cut the butter into the dry mix before adding cottage cheese and milk. I used too much cottage cheese...and I thought the mistake tasted great. I saved the leftovers, reheated in oven...they got really crunchy on outside and browner than before... Tasted even better the second baking. Be careful, you will want to eat them all in one sitting....

review/summary: best gluten-free pancakes
review/text: I am so excited that I found this pancake mix! These pancakes do not taste gluten-free at all. I add banana slices, chocolate chips, and walnuts to mine and I feel like I'm in a pancake house. I'm very pleased with this product. However, I tried the chocolate chip cookie recipe on the side panel and they were only decent. It's okay though because I already found my perfect gluten-free cookie recipes at coliescookies.com. But it's even better than a recipe because you buy the whole mix! If you want a delicious and easy cookie mix then check out the website, seriously. The cookie mixes come in all sorts of flavors and for a great value! It costs $6 for a bag and the bags make a pretty good amount of cookies. I tried the triple chocolate chip cookies and chocolate peanut butter cookies and they were soo tasty that the cookies weren't even given a chance to cool before being all eaten up!

review/text: Really no difference in the flavor than regular pancake mix. My children ate it with no problems and said it tasted the same as regular. Great for my daughter that's allergic to wheat!  Give it a try.  I paid $6.89 for just one at the local health food store. This is a much better deal!<br /><br />I wanted to add that I posted this description under Pamela's Pancake mix. I have also used the Chocolate cake mix and the bread mix. Since this is posted under all 3 for some reason I will comment on those too. The Bread mix is very good. It does take a little tweaking, maybe it's my bread machine. It is very good, everyone in the family likes it. We have made pizza crust out of it for my little girl and she loves it. We have made the cookies from the pancake mix and she loves them, we add cinnamon and sugar to them before baking. The Chocolate Cake mix is very good, it is more of a dark chocolate than a milk chocolate. We make cupcakes out of them and freeze them. Nice and fluffy. She loves them too. All in all I would say that if you can't have wheat, Pamela's products are the best choice for flavor and texture. Don't buy that already made bread. It was awful, sorry I don't remember the brand but Amazon sells it.

review/summary: The Best Gluten Free Baking Product out there!
review/text: A year ago my daughter was diagnosed with Celiac's disease.  I have tried everything there is out there to give her the closest thing there is to "normal" food.  Pamels'a baking mix by far is the BEST!  My husbands Mom also has celiac's disease and agree's this is a great product, she came to visit for Christmas and we made pancakes out of it while she was here and she went home and bought some right away.  My son who is the pickest eater ever and is not allergic to Gluten LOVES the pancakes and waffles from the mix he eates more that my daughter who is allergic to gluten.  I recomend this product to anyone who is allergic to gluten, it lets you enjoy the taste of breads again without cheating.

review/summary: The BEST GF mix made!
review/text: My son and I have been eating gluten free for many years and I have tried every GF mix that becomes available. Pamela's Ultimate baking and Pancake Mix is truly the best! The rest of the family cannot tell the items I make are wheat free and gluten free, a tell tale sign that this mix is really good. It doesn't have a gritty texture like alot of the other GF mixes out there, and makes the most wonderful muffins, pancakes and crepes. I'm eating a delicious blueberry muffin as I type and order my case! I paid $5.69 for one bag of the mix when I purchased from the store, but Amazon has it here at $4.00 a bag when you buy the case. A great savings and I know I'll go through the case quickly!<br /><br />I'm trying the chocolate cookie recipe on the bag next and as any GF eating person knows, it's difficult to find a good GF chocolate chip cookie! I'm sure these will be as equally satisfing as all the other foods I've made with this mix! Try it, you won't be unsatisfied!

review/summary: Super Scones, Excellent Pancakes.... You Can't Go Wrong!
review/text: Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix is by far the best all purpose gluten free flour mix available.  I have tried too many to count and have even mixed my own flour combinations but nothing can compare.  Everything I have made with the mix comes out great. I have been able to substitute the mix for regular flour, cup for cup, in my non-gluten recipes.  My family and friends love the scones from this mix (I usually add frozen blueberries) and my non-celiac sons can't get enough of the pancakes.[...] Word of warning: the mix contains ground almonds and should be avoided by anyone with an almond allergy or a tree nut allergy.  We found this out the hard way!

I was soooooooo pleased to find Pamela's Ultimate, the pancakes are the best.  I think they're better than Aunt Jemima's brand.  I eat mine with pink grapefruit marmalade or maple syrup.

review/summary: Best GF Pancake Mix around
review/text: This is by far my family's fave pancake mix. Before several of us had to go GF, I used to make pancakes from scratch. I have tried to make them from scratch since going GF, and this mix is way better than the results I got making them myself. Even my non-GF family members love them.<br /><br />One note: it is really easy to mis-measure the mix, in my experience. I kind of pack it into the measuring cup (make sure you use a dry measure). The thicker the batter, the higher the cakes rise, and we like them fluffy. If the batter is too thin, they will not rise much. It is just personal preference, but can be adjusted to your liking by adding or reducing mix.<br /><br />I like to make huge batches of these, cool them on a rack, and freeze them. They can be microwaved or heated in a toaster easily- just the thing for a quick breakfast on a school day, when frozen waffles and pancakes aren't an option. Yum!

review/text: I bought the pancake mix for the pancakes...they are super good. The non-celiacs like it as well as me! I decided to try the chocolate chp cookie recipe on the package. They are the best I have ever tasted...definitely tastes like the Nestles Chocolate Chip recipe! Believe it or not, I make the coookies 2-3 times a week...it is such an easy recipe and takes no time at all to mix up. The other night , I did not have time to bake them so I just put the batter in the fridge. The next day, just used a small icecream scooper to form small balls and put them on the sheet. I usually spray the small scooper with PAM and scoop up the dough and the balls will pop right out...have uniform size cookies! Hope you will try the recipe...you will not be disappointed!!<br /><br />You can also put a scoop of icecream between 2 COOLED cookies and have an ice cream sandwich!

review/text: First, I am not much of a cook.  Anything quick and easy is what I usually grab at the store.  Due to having Hashimotos Thyroiditis, I've been trying to go the gluten free route as much as possible due to the auto-immune effect.  I made pancakes this morning using the recipe on the package, and they were better than any pancakes I can remember.  One of the things that I've missed with going gluten free is that rich grain crunchiness.  These pancakes reminded me of the homemade buckwheat pancakes a friend's mother used to make from scratch.  I LOVED them and have spent the day thinking up new ways to have pancakes.  I'm sorry it took me so long to actually use this product.

review/summary: Very versatile stuff!
review/text: My new perfect-world 'wish list item' is a 'collection' that has one of each of the bag-style mixes that Pamela makes. I mean geez buying a whole collection of any given thing just to try it out is pretty expensive! But this bake mix rocks.<br /><br />I didn't use to think I had any dietary issues. When I was 35 I suddenly developed 'severe asthma' but had never had it before. But when I accidentally dropped gluten from my diet (eating mostly meats/eggs/veggies for 3 weeks) I discovered that my "severe asthma," and a decent chunk of my allergies, acne, acid reflux, brain fog, etc. were apparently due to gluten. Ironically grain-based foods have been the primary foods my entire life, sigh.<br /><br />Giving up everything remotely bread-like really sucked. I did it for the sake of keeping my sugar intake low (carbs are either fiber or sugar--so a bagel tends to have more sugar to the body than a candy bar) but once in awhile I would just leap off the wagon and eat something baked. The problem was, it wasn't just that I'd be increasing my sugar/carb intake, which I can live with now and then, but I'd be getting gluten too, and would discover by nightfall when it became inconvenient to breathe that my 'severe asthma' was back. (Why more people with asthmatic kids don't at least *try* serious food eliminations is beyond me...) My boyfriend's docs after much testing tried to diagnose him with Crohns and IBS, insisting he is not celiac [like his sister] and should just keep eating those healthy (...) whole grains. But it turns out when he avoids gluten for awhile, he isn't sick and in pain, he's just fine, as an amazing coincidence. So in the process of experimenting, we've discovered Pamela's brand. It is a dream come true.<br /><br />Pancakes. Waffles. Cookies. Cakes. Breaded fried chicken. We don't use it very often (as we're mostly lowcarb) but when we do, my 13 year old gives it two thumbs up... There is nothing we've tried to make with this, pretty much using it like flour for the most part, that has not come out good. I am hugely grateful for Pamela's brand making gluten-free eating just as tasty as mainstream food. Since I unfortunately am only 'inconvenienced' by gluten (as opposed to genuine *pain*) I'm the type that would occasionally eat it anyway just because I so missed a lifetime food that was based on grains. Thanks to Pamela's, now I can have those foods once in awhile without damaging my body in the process. Yay!  I can't wait to try some of the other options!

I have tried ALOT of other Gluten Free Mixes and the results just haven't been the same. I am always on the lookout for a new recipe I can try Pamela's with and that keeps our menu's interesting!!

review/summary: Don't Have Food Allergies, But This is Wonderful
review/text: I don't have Celiac disease, or any food allergies, but I admit a growing (if only in-the-back-of-my-mind) concern regarding gluten, (especially concerns over its importation from China); that, plus a desire to try something completely different, motivated me to first buy this nearly two months ago.  It's absolutely superb -- and I'm pretty snippety about my pancakes.  This mix makes pancakes that are rather less sweet, but much more flavorful.  Only problem: whereas I used to have pancakes perhaps twice a month with breakfast, I now have them twice a week.  Thank God I've at least taken up walking to counter-balance the temptations of Pamela's mix.  This is a very good product, very easy on the stomach, and highly recommended whether you have food allergies or not.

review/text: I thought my world of pancakes and cookies was over until I found this mix. Holy cow, this mix makes the best pancakes and chocolate chip cookies ever! There are several easy recipes on the side of the bag and I've found the flavor of everything to be equal to the beloved wheat recipes I used to use. I'm so happy I can eat my favorites again!

review/summary: Pamela's baking mix is great!
review/text: Pamela's baking mix was the savior for my gluten-free husband, as its pancakes, cookies, corn bread, and pumpkin bread recipes are great!  Also, their website has many more recipes from which to choose.  The stuff is so good, that I even prefer it to many recipes that use wheat flour.
