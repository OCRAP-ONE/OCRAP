It is divine!!! I have been using it for 20 years, and I absolutely love it.

review/summary: Home away from home :)
review/text: Vegeta is used in our house for over 30 years. This seasoning is nothing like all the others I could find in US, thinking that one day I will find One that is at least similar to Vegeta. Nothing can replace it. It can be used in every meal. It gives a nice Mediterranean flavor, doesn't take away from food flavor but blends in perfectly making every meal  delicious. 4 pounds of Vegeta can last you a long time. This is my little trick whenever I have guests coming over for dinner or cookout ... they all want to know what is it, I just laugh and tell them to enjoy and remember how delicious and different food was over at my house :)<br />I was so happy that I found it here.... it's like I said Home away from home :)<br />Try it out , you'll see what I'm talking about ...  :)

review/summary: A great low carb snack.
review/text: I have tried most of the "Just the Cheese" products and I find them satisfying, at least for the most part. Some might be a little salty; some might be a little dry. Hey, they are low carb,... what do you expect! I like to keep a drink at hand for the salty or dry ones but I have found that nacho flavor stands alone. It has a strong nacho taste in crispy (rice cracker like) rounds. It is a great snack for those of us who are watching their carbs. I say, two thumbs up for this high in protien, low in carbs snack!

review/text: I like these little cheese chips. They satisfy my craving for something crunchy. And who doesn't like that last little bit of crispy cheese from your toasted cheese sandwich. That's what these are like. Just beware - I didn't notice right away that one bag held four servings, not just one. They are pretty rich so it would be hard to eat the whole bag, but I could see munching on half of the bag, which would be 150 calories.

review/summary: Serving size disconnect
review/text: Just received these today and was stunned to see that one 2 ounce bag is considered to be FOUR servings. Really? Really?? It's the size of a small bag of chips, which one might not realize they were expected to share with three of their closest friends. Serving size disconnect affects so much of the products we buy anyway, but this takes it to a new and quite annoying level.<br /><br />Oh, and the rounds themselves? They have a nice crunch, welcomed when one has been on a low-carb diet of meat and cheese and some veggies, but the flavor is really salty. REALLY salty. And dry. You probably won't be able to eat all four servings anyway, so have a party and put out a couple of the 2 ounce bags of these for the crowd. After a few parties you'll be able to get rid of the twelve bags you just bought.

review/summary: not as good as they look
review/text: I watch the video when they were on unwrapped show and looked good so when I went on Amazon and looked them up I saw alot of different products and flavors,so I got the nacho flavor one (12 pack) and as of right now I have 9 packs left,the three missing were the one I tried,gave one to a friend and the other to a family member and we all agreed they were nasty tasting did not taste like a nacho flavor.to us they tasted like the cheese was burnt and nothing near the taste of the cheese they say that is left on the pan after you eat the pizza,but this my opinion you have to try them for yourself but you might want to check around to see if you can buy it at a local store before buying a case of them

review/summary: Melt-In-Your-Mouth Peppermint Sticks
review/text: I love these AMAZING King Leo Brand Peppermint Sticks sold by Candy Crate. They melt away in your mouth, from the first stick to the last. I've been ordering these from Candy Crate for years - first on their web site and now from Amazon. If you like peppermint, you should try these King Leo Brand Peppermint Sticks. I don't know how they make these peppermint sticks so soft, but make them they do - and they are mouth-watering. When I first ordered these peppermint sticks, I thought they would be hard like all the rest.  Boy was I surprised.  I put that first stick in my mouth and in just a few minutes, it was gone.  Of course I generally break them in half before putting them in my mouth.  That way I can savor them longer.  The last order I placed in June 2012 was for 6 tins because I had run out of tins, and I hate to do that - leaving me without my favorite candy.  And to top it off, these peppermint sticks are low in fat.  What a bonus.  Do watch out for the shipping costs because they tend to add up the more tins you order as these tins are heavy.  I hope you enjoy these peppermint sticks as much as I do - I am constantly eating them throughout the day.  I guess that is why I go through my boxes so quickly, and they may be high in sugar content, but I haven't gained a single pound from eating these sticks!

This is a wonderful gift, but you must also buy one for yourself. There is something very soothing about taking the time to enjoy a peppermint stick.

review/summary: Gotta go with the Rooster!
review/text: I have been eating this stuff for a decade and a half, ever since I worked in a teriyaki restaurant slinging yakisoba and udon soup bowls at the tender age of 18.  There are lots of good reviews on this product already and I agree with all of them... this stuff is HOT but also TASTY.  I ALWAYS have a bottle of this on hand.  My latest favorite thing to do with this sauce is to mix it with an equal part of Frank's Red Hot and a splash of vinegar and use it to drown a plateful of pelmehni (Russian dumplings).  That mixture, by the way, is also fantastic on wings.  On it's own, Rooster sauce is a MUST for me in ANY curry... it adds heat and complements the flavor perfectly and I also love to drizzle a bit (just a bit) into my chicken soup (not weird....I used to dump truckloads of Rooster into my Udon noodle soup!).  Really, the uses for the Rooster are endless.... but if you regularly cook things like stir fry or curry (any style) and you like a bit of kick.. this is a MUST HAVE pantry staple.  Plus, it's fun to dare people to eat spoonfuls of it.  :)<br /><br />I'm hungry.

review/text: UPDATE: Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NIND">Bon App&eacute;tit</a> magazine, predicts sriracha will be one of the biggest food trends of 2010!<br /><br />Knowlton was a guest on the CBS Early Show on Dec. 30, 2009 and shared, "If you walk into any chef's kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha. Sriracha is a hot sauce with flavor -- it livens up every dish you put it on."<br /><br />----<br /><br />Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables, a bottle of Sriracha (sree-RAH-cha) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery, whether it be a sidewalk hot dog stand, a family hamburger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.<br /><br />New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed "Thai ketchup." Here's an excerpt:<br /><br />[[The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong, which sports a white rooster on the label, and Shark. (Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]<br /><br />Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.<br /><br />Newman's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.<br /><br />Sriracha Remoulade<br /><br />1 cup mayonnaise<br />1/4 cup sriracha<br />2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br /><br />Whisk together until smooth.

In a bowl, combine the red-hot sauce, sriracha, and butter. Toss the wings in the sauce and serve. Garnish with baby mache or other lettuce<br /><br />Sriracha is also an excellent value. Amazon offers six 17-ounce bottles for about $20, or less than 20 cents an ounce. That's a lot of flavor for your dollar.<br /><br />In summary, I grew up with pepper, salt and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZMOY">Tabasco pepper sauce</a> on the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco? Yes. Sriracha is hotter but with a light, sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.

review/summary: Not a Condiment, More Like a Sacrament.
review/text: This bottle, or more appropriately, This Chalice, contains the true blood of the creator.  This bottle is culinary mescaline. It is a life changing sauce of the gods.  I pour nickle size blops on the back of my hand and slurp them off.  Maybe I should rephrase that. Nah... I mean it, if you are even slightly spice friendly, get this. Some hipster dope will tell you that this is not "real" or "authentic" sriracha. You tell that ironic fixie riding trustafarian to go to hell.  This is better.  This is some next level chit, mang. Its not an abusive hot, you can really taste peppers, and garlic, Its not a macho, "blew out my o-ring" hot, but it gets the endorphins flowing, elevates your conscience and we become one with the universe. No, really, I like it. It is good.

review/summary: Real. Delicious. Hot. Stuff...
review/text: When having some Asian cuisine one day, I noticed this fiery concoction sitting on the table. I put some on my plate and started eating it with an with egg roll. I was instantly hooked :-)...<br />This is a very tasty Asian-style hot sauce. It has the consistency of ketchup, but packs some nice heat. It is not like a vinegar based Louisiana style sauce, nor is it like a Mexican style sauce (typically more smoky flavored). It has a unique flavor profile, and it's great! It's sweeter tasting, with a very pronounced chili pepper flavor and just a hint of garlic, that really compliments a variety of foods. I use it on eggs, sandwiches, Asian foods, chicken, salsas, pizza, etc... Also, for the size bottle you get, it's a good value. I bought a big 17oz bottle of it for less than $3.50 at my local Walmart. Recommended!

review/summary: Great Flavor and Heat - Highly Recommended!
review/text: Huy Fong "Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce" is offered in just about every Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in my area, and with good reason! Unlike at lot of hot sauces, this has a great chili pepper and garlic flavor that compliments most of the dishes I like (particularly good on Pork Lo-Mein) and also provides a good amount of spicy heat. This is not the hottest of the hot sauces but it is on the boarder line for several of my friend.<br /><br />This is really good stuff and we almost always keep a bottle of it on hand to liven up or cooking or when take-out doesn't have enough "zing". It is also great spread on chicken when grilling but watch the smoke when opening the grill lid, it is like OC spray if it gets into your eyes.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: Huy Fong Sriracha is liquid fire when ingested in large quantities.. has a very mellow burn at first that builds up over time into a total sting.  Its not so overwhelming that you cant taste anything afterwards,  which is what makes this so deceptively good. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Some of my favorite recipes;<br /><br />Mix a can of Tuna with 1oz of Sriracha in a bowl and serve on a sandwich, over rice, or as the core of a Spicy tuna Maki roll.<br /><br />For Wings,  Simply coating them with Sriracha will put an epic bite on anyone eating them, a solid 6 on the hot scale, but lets the chicken flavor come through.  For EXTRA hot,  add a 2oz jar of powdered Wasabi Horseradish to the mix and get ready for the pain.<br /><br />Lastly,  Mix a fair amount of Sriracha in with your Spaghetti sauce for some really nice kick.

review/summary: The BEST!
review/text: As everyone else has already said, this is the best hot sauce on the planet!  We always called it "rooster sauce"...and my first exposure to it was this little bar/restaurant that was local to the college I was attending at the time (quite some time ago...lol).  Anyway, I used to put this sauce on EVERYTHING - pizza, burgers, french fries, marinara-based pastas....even omelettes/scrambled eggs.  But once I graduated and moved, I didn't run across Sriracha chili sauce (the original Huy Fong version, that is) for years.  I stumbled across it recently on an Asian food website and promptly ordered 4 bottles.  I just ordered 6 more today!  And just so you know, the Amazon price for the 6-pack beats anything I've come across thus far (especially considering that it's eligible for free shipping if you spend $25 or more).<br /><br />While I love anything spicy, I suppose that some folks might find this to be a bit much (so if you don't like spicy food, stear clear).  But for those of you who enjoy "spicy", this is the ultimate condiment!  I disagree with the reviewer who stated that they don't taste much of a difference between this and Tabasco.  This sauce tastes like chili peppers and garlic.  I think Tabasco has more of a vinegar taste to it.  Plus, Sriracha sauce is THICK - which I like much better, as it stays on food like pizza or french fries.  Tabasco is watery...and isn't as hot as Sriracha.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great deal - so stock up!  You won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Spicy and utterly addictive
review/text: Like many others, I can't say enough good things about Huy Fong's Sriracha Hot Chili sauce. There are other brands (some of which blatantly copy the bottle design) but stick with the original.<br />If you've never tried this you probably want to know what all the fuss is about. To summarise, Sriracha adds a kick to just about everything - it's a tasty slightly sweet/somewhat salty chili heat, with a gradual burn that gets better the more you consume. There are hotter hot sauces but often you want to enhance what you're eating - for this Sriracha is great. I find it's especially good with Chinese takeout or anything fried. Pizza, noodles, even a Salad benefits from Sriracha.<br />The only slight disadvantage is that sometimes the chili heat is a bit inconsistent from bottle to bottle. There have been bottles I've tried that aren't all that hot to others that were hotter than normal (and no, for me that isn't a bad thing!)<br />Anyway, I am pretty much addicted to this sauce. You may also want to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SKCVI">Huy Fong Vietnamese Chili Garlic Sauce, 8 Oz.</a> which is better suited for cooking with but you can use it as a condiment.<br />UPDATE: Check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NRMHEE">Huy Fong Sriracha Chili Sauce, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> for the 12 pack instead of the 6 pack, it's a better value.

review/summary: The best hot sauce, but perhaps not the best pricing from Amazon
review/text: This is the best hot sauce ever created.  If you have never tried the rooster sauce, please, do yourself a favor, and go try it.  It even appeals to people who don't typically like hot sauce.  It's got a bite, but it's got great flavor too.  And when you get that ratio of pain and pleasure just right, you get a hot sauce as addictive as sriracha.  And it is ADDICTIVE.  I put it on everything except sweets.  Unlike other hot sauces, it has a thicker viscosity and sticks nicely to anything you squeeze it on.  And a squeeze bottle is far superior than those bottles you have to turn on their side and smack from the bottom and make a mess all over the place with.<br /><br />My only complain is that I'm pretty sure I'm paying more than I should be by buying this product on Amazon. But the convenience of having this come to me in one-click is worth it, and I try not to think about how much Amazon might be fleecing me over this purchase.

review/text: I love, love, love this stuff, and put it on everything.  It's not *that* hot, at least not to me (when I want "really hot" I use something like '100% Pain' or just crumble a bunch of dried hot chili peppers), but this stuff is complex and "sweet-hot" in a way that's REALLY addictive, the way Thai food is addictive.  Other sauces are too bland, too vinegary, too sour, too sweet, but this is perfect.  This is my ketchup, my mustard, my relish, my salt and pepper.  I douse it on breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  For some reason it seems to go with food of every ethnicity.  It's especially awesome on burritos, and on fried rice.  And on pasta sauce.  And in soups (especially lentil).  I probably go through a bottle every five to ten days.  One week my grocery store ran out of it, and I was despondent.  Nothing tasted right that week, and I was so elated when I finally found some again.  Whoever came up with this stuff deserves a Nobel Prize in saucerie.<br /><br />Buy the way, vegetarians note: this sauce doesn't contain any fish extracts or any of that other stuff that can ruin some Asian sauces for us.  Yay!

review/summary: Great stuff for that authentic Thai and Vietnamese heat
review/text: This Huy Fong rooster brand sriracha sauce is very popular in Asian communities. Its distinctive shape and green top is the kind you see in Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese restaurants all over. Named after the Thai city of Sri Racha, this bottle is on almost every table of every Southeast Asian restaurant I've ever eaten at, next to the soy sauce and napkins. The squeeze bottle and pointed nozzle makes dispensing very easy. The sauce is smooth, so a gentle squeeze will give you control and precision. It looks like ketchup coming out, but is a bit more viscous.<br /><br />It's great on chicken or beef satay skewers and just about any food. It made with chili peppers and garlic and has a wonderful flavor on its own, not just heat. I enjoy it regularly with Vietnamese beef pho. It dissolves easily into the soup and adds a wallop. It's hot, but not insanely so, and the heat doesn't stay on your tongue and keep burning you like habeneros. American-styled hot sauces like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB34JE">Trappeys</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZSYS">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce</a> are typically very drippy with a dominant vinegar taste and smell. Sriracha is not.<br /><br />The product contains preservatives, so it needs no refrigeration. Refrigerating can cause the ink on the label to come off over time.

review/text: Sriracha is a chili garlic sauce. Any good Sriracha should have a very short list of ingredients (Chili, sugar, garlic, salt, distilled vinegar, potassium sorbate and sodium disulfite as preservaties, and xanthan gum). As far as many are concerned Huy Fong (with the distinctive rooster label) is the best of the best. It has a crazy good fresh chili taste, with a good bite of garlic and a sweet background. This is not "heat" for "heat's" sake. You eat this sauce for the flavor and either enjoy, or deal with, the heat. If you're a chili head this sauce rates about a medium. For everyone else it is quite hot.

It's more flavorful too, and not too spicy in my opinion.  It's excellent on just about anything, I made some awful bland chickpea burgers.  I doused them with some Sriracha and then added some zesty bread and butter pickles, sounds weird but I'm telling you this stuff can make anything taste awesome.  I'm looking forward to actually trying it on something asian, I think it would be great on seafood. Anyhow, this stuff rocks.

review/summary: A Potent Hot Sauce, similar to Tabasco, just Better. Buy the 28oz which costs only a few cents more
review/text: This hot sauce has become a staple in my kitchen and replaced my bottle of Tabasco. Like Tabasco - it is primarily a hot (cayenne?) pepper delivery device. A few drops add a considerable amount of heat to any dish. This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks, etc.<br /><br />While Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a heavy amount of vinegar - this sauce has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat, yet the heat is considerable and dominates. It also lingers, on your taste buds, longer than Tabasco. There is a subtle amount of sweetness to this sauce along with faint garlic notes. While Tabasco can taste quite harsh if you add too much to a dish ---- this sauce, no matter how much you add, tastes fresh and just a bit sweet.<br /><br />I wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato was simply the "sun ripened chilies" and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary taste<br /><br />While I really like this product and certainly recommend its purchase --------- I'm not sure it rates 5 stars because the overall flavor does not seem TRULY exceptional - only VERY GOOD. There really is just one major taste evident and that is heat - and after that only a vague hint of something else which seems to be chiles, sugar and garlic. But chiles, sugar and garlic certainly beats (by a very wide margin) --- the heavy vinegar aftertaste as evidenced in Tabasco and many other hot sauces.<br /><br />For the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- I'm glad to always have it on hand and it is a true staple.<br /><br />Amazon prices the 17oz at $5.19 and the 27oz at $5.89. It is a true no-brainer to purchase the 28oz size.<br /><br />As another reviewer recommended - given the potency of this stuff - you probably ONLY want to have a single bottle on hand. Larger quantities will deteriorate over time. I'd recommend you purchase this locally and not in the 2/3/6 packs offered on Amazon. I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year. As I said: this is potent stuff.<br /><br />Update (July 2010) - a formal taste test<br /><br />I put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too "hot" to taste<br /><br />Results: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh and sweeter note

review/summary: Most disgusting thing I've ever tasted
review/text: I have no idea why this tasted SO bad to me... I normally am a fan of hot sauces, and I'm a pretty adventurous eater. But all I remember is this taste being revoltingly bad in my mouth. I can't even describe it to you, though I wish I could. I guess if I had to put words to it it would be a bizarre combination of FISHY peppers, vinegar, and tomatoes. Did I get a bad batch or something? Ew.

review/text: Ha.  You think you can handle your Meth?  Your Vodka?  Your Smack?<br /><br />That stuff is Cream of Wheat compared to The Ratch.  One day, it's a little dab - you know, for kicks.  To look cool.  Fit in with the hipsters.  A month later, heck - for me it was half a day - I'm a certified Ratch Head, holding a bottle of the Red Devil upside down like a plasma bag, sucking the heat from a clear plastic tube that I ripped from my little girl's aquarium air pump.  The fish died, but I didn't care.  They tasted sooo goooooood.<br /><br />I lost everything.  My faith in ketchup.  My faith in Chinese mustard.  My cutlery (no pride, I'd just face-plant onto the plate and suck.)  When the intervention happened, they found me curled up in the Specialty Foods Aisle of Target with a fiery cake of Ratch and oyster crackers pasted to my face and clothes.<br /><br />Rehab taught me that once a Ratch Head, always.  I met people there who assured me that I was ok without Sriracha.  That I didn't NEED heat.  The doctors, Mr. Heinz and Mrs. French put me on a new diet of quiet, soft condiments that - well, sure.  They don't have flavor, but they're certainly not making me think of them every hour of the day, either.<br /><br />I have a steady job now, new friends and tonight, we're getting together for Tuna Helper and instant lemonade.<br /><br />Stay away from Srirach sauce.<br /><br />Wait.  Did someone say chicken fingers?  (sniff sniff)<br /><br />Those ARE chicken fingers!<br /><br />SRIRACHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA TIME!!

review/summary: Crunchy Cookie with a Hint of Chocolate and Orange
review/text: Pepperidge Farm is one of the few national companies that mass markets distinctive cookies.  One of those cookies is the marvelous Orange Milano cookie.  When you bite into this crunchy cookie you get a hint of chocolate as you reach the center, and as you chew the orange flavor spreads throughout your mouth.  Yet, none of the flavors is overwhelming.  The problem with Orange Milano cookies is that it is hard to stop after eating only one.<br /><br />These cookies are relatively expensive compared to other brands.  However, one of the hallmarks of Pepperidge Farm from the beginning of the company in the 1930s is quality.  For an alternative to the sweeter cookies typically available in the cookie isle, try Pepperidge Farm's cookies.  If you are looking for a good cookie to try first, this one is a winner.

review/text: I bought several varieties of these Cavendish & Harvey Drops in the ten-packs, so that I'd have plenty of individual tins to give to co-workers as part of Christmas baskets and to share with my university students (sugar helps them stay awake during those evening classes), and I'm very pleased with the price (as long as it works out to less than $2.50 per tin, which it does for this variety if you buy enough to get the free shipping).<br /><br />The pink grapefruit flavor is particularly popular with my friends and family (some of whom love grapefruit but can't eat the fruit itself anymore because of medicine interactions) AND with my students.  The other clear favorite (judging by which tins get emptied the fastest when I set them out at the beginning of each night class) is the Wild Berry variety.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoy the sour cherry and the orange flavors I bought, as well (though possibly not quite as much as I like the grapefruit and wild berry), so as long as the price stays nice, I'll order more of these, probably, in time for Valentine's Day!

review/text: I love mangoes and I love matcha, so this is the perfect combo for me! However, this isn't your plain old mango tea taste. The mango aspect is quite interesting--it's not juicy mango flesh, but more like... you know, when you're cutting a mango and there's some flesh left after you peel it so you scrape your teeth on the rind to get it all? You get mango flesh, but also some rind-y goodness as well that adds a woodsy, almost tangy taste. Well, that's what the mango is like here! Rind-y. It's kind of nice, quite different from other mango teas I've tried.<br /><br />There's also a hint of citrus, a lemon-y quality. It goes well with the matcha, whose grassiness really adds to the mango/lemon tastes. Refreshing, great iced!

review/summary: Great for anyone who loves matcha and fresh mangoes!
review/text: The smell of this tea is wonderful. It smells like fresh mango juice. I would describe it as a very clean and refreshing smell, which is how I feel about most matchas. I will also say that I had no issues with clumps. I have been very careful to check the temperature of my water before adding it to the tea, and so far have not had any bitter disasters. The mango matcha has a grassy sweetness that definitely keeps the mango taste. The actual flavour isn't as strong as the smell, but I think that it would be overpowering if it was. I love this both hot and iced, which a slight edge going to the iced version. I haven't tried it yet in a smoothie, but I am thinking it would be fantastic. I did try adding a bit to some yogurt, and it was almost perfect - this was the only time I had clumps, but I also wasn't very patient trying to mix it all together. I would definitely purchase this again, and can't wait to try more from Red Leaf Teas.

review/summary: Leggo my Mango!
review/text: After seeing some of the glowing reviews for this matcha, I had to try it. Trying Mango Diablo from DavidsTea recently has brought back to mind my love of mangos and real mango flavor. I had forgotten it in the face of so much fake-tasting mango flavored tea and candy out there. But I used to beg my mom to let me buy a mango. There are few things better than slicing into a perfectly ripe mango. Makes a royal mess to eat it (at least, the way I did it), but it was so, so worth it. Still, I hate messy food, so if I can find that mango flavor without the mess, I am all for it! It was a bit worried about this tea after the strange bitterness of the Peach and Lemon flavors, but what's life without a few risks? Mango makes me think of summer and tropical smoothies and everything delicious in life.<br /><br />So when I opened it, it had that same smell the Peach and Lemon flavors had, a faint hint of bitterness, and I got worried. Still, never let it be said that I'm afraid to try new things. I made a cup of this to take to work with me, and thank goodness I did, it was a hellish day and I desperately needed the energy from it. But...it wasn't that great. It tasted like decent mango flavor with a back hint of chemicals. I don't know what it is, but I think I just need to stay away from the citrus group of flavored matchas. The Peach redeemed itself when iced, so maybe the mango will do the same. I'm hoping it does. My feelings may also be skewed a bit, I've been spoiled by the delicious goodness of the Mango Diablo from Davids, so my opinions on the mango flavor might have been different if I hadn't been drinking tons of the Mango Diablo lately. That's my new standard for mango flavor and this just doesn't match up to it.<br /><br />Still, it will be no great hardship to finish this off, especially in smoothies over the coming summer months. It's not horrible, it's just not for me. But maybe a lower temperature will help or finding another way to drink it. Or maybe one of my friends will try it and like it and then it will have a good home!

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I'd never eaten tortilla soup before this, but I really liked this soup.<br />I thought it was delicious!  I also had the black bean, which I thought was almost as good as this one.  These taste much better than Fantastic brand IMO.  Great to take to work or school.

review/summary: Pretty good.
review/text: I found this to be pretty good, not amazing, but good for the value and it has very good nutrition for a instant meal, It had about 200 calories total, and no scary ingredients like food dyes or hydrogenated oils, etc. ( I am no food nut, but I try to avoid the obviously bad for you ingredients where I can).<br /><br />When I opened the paper lid to the cup there was a little foil packet inside, that I had to use seizors to open...maybe I am just not good at opening little packets. This was pretty messy and the only reason I did not give this product 5/5 stars. I wish they had just mixed the flavor packet with the rest of the food, though I am sure they have their reasons for putting it in a separate packet. The veggies in mine cooked well. I used 200 degree f. water for this. If you like cream of wheat you might like this, because the "tamale" turns out to be more of a cream of wheat texture, but with a nice spicy touch that reminds you of tamales. There are crunchy chips in the soup which were good. I felt satisfied after eating this with a bag of carrots and a cheese stick. I buy this product weekly with a few other Mc.Dougall soups for my lunches at work. Don't get me wrong though, I probably would never have tried Mc. Dougalls products if I had not been recently diagnosed with a disease that has made me take a gluten free diet, not because I want to, but its my prescription! lol. I am glad that I did find these products, because for the price, easy to prepare, and good nutrition they have, it's hard to beat them. So all in all I recommend them to anyone.

review/summary: not as good as many other Dr McDougall's
review/text: but still pretty good.  And relatively health and cheap.  If you want a fast soup for lunch, these are great.  Just add hot water, stir and wait.  All the varieties I've tried taste great, but I would put Split Pea and Black Bean and Lime at the top (with this 3rd or 4th).

review/text: This and Pad Thai Noodle soup are my favorites, they pack lots of flavor.  It seems best to stir a second time a few minutes after the first stir, then I leave a few minutes longer than it says on the label.  Unquestionably Five Star.

review/summary: Good and reasonably healthy (but high sodium)
review/text: This soup met my expectations.  At first, I thought it was a bit light on flavor, but the flavor developed as I ate it and by the time I finished, I was pleased with it.  I used the "boiling water" method which I prefer to micro-waving and let is set for about 10 minutes.  It is "soupy" but there was enough texture and bits of veggies to satisfy and I found it filling enough for a lunch.  The only problem I had was the top covering which was hard to peel back and tore apart, so I just covered it with a saucer while "cooking" for the 6-10 minutes.<br /><br />The thing I *really* like about the soup is that it is filling, but only 200 calories and 2g of fat. Only 20 calories are from fat. Zero saturated fat or cholesterol.<br /><br />I took away a star for bad product info on the pkg where the values shown look really good until you realize that they consider one cup to be 2 servings, so you have to double all the figures shown.  I found this misleading and questionable.  One cup of soup for two people?  I don't think so.<br /><br />This soup has 620mg of sodium, but lots of vitamin A, so it's a reasonably healthy meal. I also like the Nile Spice soups, they also tend to be high in sodium, but they are honest about it and call out 1 cup as one serving.

review/text: I wish this one was a bolder flavor. It really isn't a southwest flavored as I'd like.<br /><br />Sometimes, following package instructions, the beans don't soften enough. Requires longer 'sit and soak' time.

review/summary: Delish snack or lunch
review/text: My hero, Dr. McDougall, has quite a selection of soups on the market. You usually pay $1.99 in brick and mortar stores for this particular one and that's why I bought them from Amazon by the 6-pack at $1.87 each. The tortilla soup is very good and I agree that if you follow the directions for preparation and stir well and wait 6  minutes while all the flavors marry, you'll have yourself a nutritious, delicious lunch or snack. Can't go wrong for just 200 calories (the whole cup). Heck, you could even add a handful of your own crushed tortilla chips and still have a lo-cal, good-for-you meal.

review/summary: Good Veggie Soup!
review/text: finding vegetarian "ramen-style" easy-soups ain't easy, so I was happy to find these.  The price is about the same as my local Co-op (which I found them at later) so I probably won't by them on amazon again.<br /><br />Good enough to keep by my desk when I forget my lunch.  Easy to make with boiling water.  This flavor is allright, tho kinda watery for me.  I prefer the Black Bean one better.

review/summary: Disgusting and Soggy Tortillas
review/text: Simple directions, similar to ramen noodles to go. I thought this would be good for lunch. Very bland flavor, soggy tortillas and insulting as a meal. Vegan food should not be less than any other food. One positive, it has a good aroma. I missed my return deadline so I have 4 left. I tried one & couldn't get past 2 spoonfuls. I had someone else try one with the same results, and he eats almost everything.

review/summary: My new favorite!
review/text: I was looking for some new items to add variety to my daily lunch routine and came across Dr. McDougall's items.  As they seemed to be reaonsable insofar as calories and sodium, I gave this one and the Black Bean & Lime Soup a try.  The Black Bean is plenty thick and but is unremarkable when compared to other black bean soups I've enjoyed in the past (I'm adding seasoning to kick it up a bit).  But this Tortilla Soup has a seasoning mix that absolutely tickled my taste buds and left me wanting for more (though I did find it plenty filling)!  I'll now certainly look forward to those days when my lunch rotation turns back to the Tortilla Soup--as I said, my new favorite!

review/text: I love this soup.  It is necessary to let this soup sit for 10 or 15 minutes after heating it to make sure all the vegetables are fully cooked.  It is amazing how tasty these vegan products are.  One container is not really two servings, as indicated on the label.  It is a very filling serving for one person, but it is low calorie, low sodium, low fat and vegan.
