review/summary: Healthier than Cheerios
review/text: I've been looking for a healthy snack and breakfast cereal for my toddler for a long time. I want something that's high in calcium and other essential nutrients, yet low in sodium and sugar. Babies have more sensitive taste buds so something tasteless to us can be tasty to them. Actually, I still wish these puffs are a little less sweet though although it's already considered as low in sugar. I've bought Happy Baby Puffs which are great and my son loves them but they are too airy to be eaten as breakfast. I think Teddy Puffs are great! They are not that hard. If your child eats Cheerios or crackers, she will be okay with this.

review/summary: Teddy Puffs Rock!
review/text: It may seem like a case of Teddy Puffs is a lot to buy in one batch, but you'd be surprised how quickly the boxes disappear. Teddy Puffs are awesome because it gives my son a mini boost of nutrition, they're not overly sugary and he can eat them for breakfast or snacks. I highly recommend them for the "organic savvy" family.

review/text: My son loves this cereal he's been eating it since he's been about 6-7 months old, they are big so you need to break them up but it's easy enough to do with your fingers. We always used this as a fall back when he didn't want to eat. It's great cause it's not too sweet and even a nice snack for mom!

review/summary: For toddlers, not really.
review/text: This cereal is definitely not for toddlers who are not expert chewers. They are hard and bigger than cheerios and they don't have much taste (they taste like grain). You are much better off buying apple cinnamon cheerios, they are cheaper and your toddler won't choke on them as fast as they would on this cereal.

review/summary: Best Belgian Chocolates I have had
review/text: Obviously pricey outside of Belgium (or Europe for that matter) however the quality is unmatched.  I bought these for my wife on Easter instead of the traditional (and dare I say highly repetitive) chocolate box brand.  First, the milk chocolate is obviously of higher quality and retains its creamy taste even if regrigerated.  The fillings and cremes are superb.  The only problem I have now is that my wife wants them on every insignificant occasion now!

review/text: Leonidas is a wonderful brand of chocolate and previously hard to get in the US if you didn't have a friend flying to Belgium every week. I found these on Amazon and now my daughter thinks I'm the best mom. They are made without preservatives so they need to be well cared for and not kept around too long. That is not a problem since they taste as great as they do. This package offers a variety of flavors and types to try as well. We really enjoyed having it around. Too bad it didn't last very long before it was gone.

review/summary: Amazing chocolates!
review/text: As with other reviews I was worried about spending so much on chocolates.  I was entirely taken back at how amazing these chocolates were!  I'm not huge on the chocolates filled with items (Some coconut and one that tasted like banana).<br /><br />One thing I will mention.  If you are ordering this as a Christmas present, you better hope that you get the box before it's seen by the person you are giving it to!  On the outside of the box it clearly says "Leonidas Belgian Chocolate".  That was an Xmas present ruined but the chocolates were still enjoyed.  Also, and I don't know if this was just my box or all of them, but you don't get a "map" as to what chocolates are filled with what.  This means that if you don't like a certain chocolate you have to gently bite into a piece that you take and hope it's not that certain flavor :)<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase.  The box looks great that the chocolates come in which adds a nice "Fancy chocolate" touch to it.  They were also packaged very well so nothing was damaged in shipping.

[*grin*] i had eaten three of the packets already and when i when to get the next one i found grubs [worms] and moths in the bags. NOT all of them - one packet in the 2nd box seemed ok.<br /><br />so, lets see ... out of 21 packets there was ONE that had no [visible] bugs. i had already eaten 3 packets.<br /><br />how many bug eggs did i eat? [*grin*]<br /><br />now, i KNOW that one of the gotchas with organic and/or all-natural foods is the higher loss rates to pests. so it's not a _total_ surprise to find bugs hatching out.<br /><br />it is however, unacceptable.<br /><br />i admit that i had left the boxes setting in the pantry for more than three months. i was in for another round of chemo and just didn't eat anything that wasn't on my approved foods list. still, the fact that ONE packet had no bugs - and that NO bugs were loose in the box that held the packets - seems to mean that the bug eggs were on the product before i got it.<br /><br />i suppose i'll try this product one more time. but it NEEDS to be store-able for a few months for me to be able to buy it in the rather large quantities it is sold in.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee

review/text: As I mentioned in my other review of Brown Family Maple Candy, my children are allergic to all other types of candy.  Maple candy is the only candy they can eat.  Naturally, we need a less expensive source so that we have it on hand for holidays, birthday parties and treats.<br /><br />This candy seems fresh.  When you bite into it, it's soft and crumbly inside, not hard like some older candy.  It has a lovely consistency, and is delcious.  We also appreciate that it is 100% maple candy, not like some of the other brands which are a mix.<br /><br />The way that this is packaged allows our girls to eat one piece in a neater fashion than when we give them the whole maple leaf and either try to cut it up or allow them to eat half.<br /><br />The only room for improvement would be offering this as a subscribe and save option the way amazon did previously with the maple leaf design.

review/text: Overall it is a neat box with some great candy that brought back many memories for my parents.  Some of the pieces seemed a bit stale and hard and the moonpie was basically crushed, though we've only eaten a few pieces so far.  You couldn't find this type of candy anywhere so it is a great concept to bring all of it back again in one box.  My biggest complaint was the ground shipping which was over priced in my opinion.  I'm not sure how long this company has been doing it but it appears they have some things to correct in order to succeed further.  I noticed too that the candy was all in a jumbled mess.  I'm not sure a woman would have organized the box in that same fashion.  So please try to correct these issues and I will buy from you again.  Thank you.

review/summary: Fun gift
review/text: This a fun idea.  Most of the candy is available at local stores, but it is nice to have someone else put it all together for you.  The box is cute with the warning sticker on top.  My parents loved it and reminisced for days.  They got a kick out of how much their little grandchildren loved the candies.

review/summary: Wish it was as pretty as the picture
review/text: I purchased this item for my grandma this last Christmas. She thought it was pretty neat and it brought back some memories for her. Overall it's a great concept and for the right person it's a great gift. I was a bit frustrated with the contents being a mess and some of the candy packages were opened or the candy was smashed to powder. A little packaging improvement (and some bubble wrap or foam) would go a long way!

review/text: I bought this for my partner's 60th birthday. Of course, she had fun seeing all this stuff again - though she said that some of it does not look familiar, probably because it wasn't marketed in NY. Our 11 year old son also enjoyed picking out his dessert from it every day and so did all our elderly friends! I found it funny that all this candy has Nutrition Facts on it, something it didn't when it was first manufactured! We called it the box 'o fun, we loved it so much. A lot of the stuff has peanut butter in it so be careful!

review/text: I sent this as a get well gift.  The candy was great (a few of the candy cigarettes were broken), but most everything was still fresh and good quality.  My gripe is that it looks like this arrives in a fancy cigar box type of presentation like a gift bag.  It isn't.  It is simply a box with a few fliers inside with facts about the 50s etc.  Be sure to add giftwraping if you want this to look like a gift.

review/text: Is it a great product or great value? No. Did my girlfriend's parents love it anyway? Yes. It seems like a thoughtful gift since it's specific to the person receiving it. So, if there's a difficult someone on your gift list that's around 50-60 years old and has a sweet tooth, you could do worse than this box of goodies. Just make sure you know how old the recipient is. Don't want to go offending people with your gifts.

Save yourself the cash and put together something yourself.  It will be much better quality.  Some of the candy was stale and some items were crushed.  Great idea but poorly put together.

review/text: I bought the Hometown Favorites 1950's Nostalgic Gift Box for my candy-loving teenagers. When the box was delivered yesterday, I couldn't resist taking a peek before I wrapped it. The box was full of great old-fashioned candy. I also couldn't resist nabbing a candy bar from the box to eat myself. There was much more candy in the box than I expected; the majority of the candy was big, full-size bars. I thought the display box was really cute too. The candy was packaged great, shipped fast and received in perfect condition. I was extremely pleased with the candy gift box and ordered several more to give to other family members. This is an incredible gift!

review/summary: If I could give no stars... I would, but it's not possible.
review/text: I gave this as a gift to a friend in my office. She and I love this kind of stuff and I was very excited to send it to the office so we could open it together. The packaging is very cute, including the booklet about the 50's. We were going through the candy, yelling and screaming about how we remember this one and that. Then we got to the moon pie which not only looked crushed, but it also looked old. Then we checked the other candy like the MaryJanes and those were hard and inedible. Though we checked the expiration dates on the candy that had them, and they were within the dates, they definitely were not fresh and the enthusiasm for this product quickly faded knowing we weren't going to be eating any of it. I am very disappointed in this item. Especially because it's packaged as a gift to give to someone. I would not recommend sending this to anyone because the quality of the candy is not acceptable. To make matters worse, this item is not returnable.

review/text: If I had paid the price that they are asking now plus shipping, I would have been disappointed. There is not enough good solid candy and the box is smaller than shown. However, it is a great idea, especially for older couples who really don't need anything, b/c they get a trip down memory lane. The rep. from the actual store was helpful in explaining that what I purchased was paid for by Amazon, when my pkg. did not arrive. And, Amazon customer service was excellent!! Buying it a lower price from Amazon and prime shipping made it a good gift!

review/summary: A Blast at the Retirement Home!
review/text: I sent this to my father for his birthday and he had the best time handing out the candy in the retirement center where he lives.  Everyone found out it was his birthday this way.  He didn't think the candies were exceptional tasting but he enjoyed seeing his friends' eyes light up when they saw their old favorites. It generated a lot of talking, laughing and reminiscing. A bunch of ladies got into the candy cigarettes and had their picture taken "smoking" in the lounge!  Dad is  very frugal and unfortunately, the price slip was included.  So, first he says to me, kidding a bit but also showing his German roots: "Gayle, $40 for a box of candy?!" But he called me several times after to let me know that he got his $40 worth of fun!  I did consider getting the 40's gift box, as that was more my father's era, but this gift has a lot more candy and I figured he'd enjoy having plenty to share.  My 76 year old father thought the candy selection was right on target for what he remembered buying as a kid.

review/summary: 50's Candy makes an Old Man Smile
review/text: My father in law has Parkinson's and other issues.  When he opened the box of 50's candy on Christmas, he smiled and stated "I remember these penny candies".  He has been showing everyone that stops by about these candies and smiles.  This was a the perfect gift! Thanks

review/summary: They're still talking about it!
review/text: Last Christmas I ordered a package for each member of my family, appropriate for their particular decade. As we're getting into our 50's and 60's it's more and more difficult to buy for one another. This was the perfect gift in that it triggered countless happy memories, memories they shared with their spouses and children. The kids liked the gift because it drew out memories their parents hadn't shared before. An unexpected holiday hit, that's for sure.

review/text: I purchased a Nostalgic Candy Gift Box for each of my sisters this Christmas. They all called me to thank me for the gift. They said the candy was delicious and that they had so much fun picking out their favorites and talking about "the old days" when they could buy this candy. I'm buying these candy packs again for birthdays, Christmas and whenever. This is a great gift.

review/text: I love raw almonds but these are horrible. First bunch of almonds tasted ok but on the second handful I grabbed a bunch of dry, rancid tasting ones.  I literally spit them right out and they left a horrible taste in my mouth. Looking at these ... They don't look like raw almonds I've purchased from whole foods or trader joes.  The outer skin is dusty looking. And tastes like it looks. Would not recommend.

review/summary: Coffee grinds everywhere
review/text: This is my wife's favorite flavor K-Cup.  Unfortunately out of a box of 24 K-cups, probably 5-6 yield a cup full of coffee grinds.  We've tried 2 separate orders from Amazon (2 boxes each, so 4 total boxes) and this happened pretty consistently.  About 20-30% of the cups of coffee were ruined due to being filled with grinds.  I don't know if this is a temporary thing, maybe there's a bad batch, but I'd stay away from these K-Cups until they fix the problem.  Too bad, because as I said, it's my wife's favorite flavor.

review/text: After reading many of the coffee reviews I was becoming more nervous as I debated about ordering<br />or not!! There were many negative comments about flavor of the coffee, aftertaste, condition of the K-cups not up to par etc. But today I am happy to report that I am "more than pleasantly surprised" that I decided to order.  I joined the "Subscribe and Save" order plan for the Van Houtte Decaffeinated med. roast K-cups for my Keurig brewer.  The price was unbeatable and the quality was first rate and they were here in a flash!  And delicious - perfect blend - I love it!<br />Thanks- I don't have to worry about running out of coffee any more..whew!!  Lolo107

review/summary: My Favorite Decaf
review/text: I drink only flavored caffeinated coffee.  I sampled about 24 flavors of k-cups and have narrowed my favorites down to 6.  However, I do not drink "leaded" coffee after noon. Unfortunately, there seems to be only 2 flavors in decaf k-cups and I am not particularly fond of either one.  So, I went on a mission to find unflavored decaf that I like enough to drink afternoons and evenings.<br /><br />I ordered a few of those pricey 5 cup samples from Keurig.  Some of them were so bad, I threw them out.  My research paid off though.  I really like Van Houtte's medium roast decaf, which was an unexpected, but welcome surprise.<br /><br />I wouldn't like any k-cup if the grounds wound up in my cup, as a couple of people have reported here. But, that hasn't happened - at least not since I returned a defective Keurig coffee maker and received a replacement.  I might add that I am on my 8th box of this coffee, so if there was a "fragile" batch, the problem was likely corrected.

review/text: I've found that the Italian Sweet Creme is my favorite of all the Coffee-Mate flavors with one reserve.  The hesitance comes with the high too-sweet power of the cream.  The counter act is to mix the Italian Sweet Creme 50/50 with Coffee-Mate's Original Creme.  Then it's not too sweet and you can enjoy the taste of the coffee as well as the Italian Sweet Creme.
