review/summary: It's called Sleepytime Tea FOR A REASON!
review/text: There are many teas out there that say they are great for before bedtime. As a huge tea buff, I can safely say that this is the tea to drink if you want to relax and just pass out. It's amazing how fast the tea works because after a few sips, you start to feel drowsy. After one cup, you wish you had showered before you drank the tea because now you're just so sleepy!

review/summary: Excellent Value for our Favorite Tea
review/text: My husband and I have a very large cup of Sleepytime every night before lights out, and we sleep soundly for 8+ hours! It has become our tradition and with consuming 4 bags a night, we were going through a 20-bag box every 5 days which was adding up at the supermarket price. When I found this on Amazon.com we couldn't believe the price difference for 6-boxes of 40 bags each or 240 tea bags total. It comes right to our door and saves us more than $1.50 per box plus the cost of gas.

review/text: Hi,  My husband and I just wanted everyone to know that we really enjoy "Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Sleepytime".  We have found that after a hard day, it doesn't matter the weather, we can enjoy a hot cup of this Sleepytime tea and relax.  We drink it before we go to bed and it does help to get a better nights sleep.  Now it may not do this for everyone that drinks it, but it does us.  So glad we can save and buy this wonderful product from, Amazon.com.  Thank you, Don and Jan Haun, Ohio

review/summary: Great relaxer, and does not interfere with my medications.
review/text: I have been a big fan of Celestial Seasonings since the 1980s, when a friend drank the different blends and I tried one.  My husband drinks this faithfully every night, and I sometimes drink some of his. I do have one complaint, though small:  when I drink a full cup, it sends me to the bathroom a couple of times in the night.<br /><br />I also notice that it does not interfere with my or my husband's medications; that is a big concern among alot of people and medical community.  Everyone reacts differently, I know; if you want to buy one box and try a few drinks of it each night or every other night, if you are on prescriptions like we are(we are only baby boomers,not old people), I would do it that way.<br /><br />In a previous review from someone who sweetens it, I think that would ruin the whole taste and aroma of the SleepyTime.  Give it time and it will grow on you.

review/summary: A Single Mother's Best Friend!!
review/text: I am a single mother and suffer from what I'm sure most single parents (or any parent for that matter) do at night, restless mind and lack of "me" time!<br /><br />Sometimes I have difficulty falling asleep, due to stress or just having so much to do directly before bed that I get a bit "hyped up" when I should be relaxing. I obviously cannot skip some of the activities that create energy before bed, but I have found a way to induce relaxation to prepare me for bed while doing whatever needs to be done for the night.<br /><br />I can do the dishes, pick up toys, fold laundry, etc. while sipping on Sleepytime tea. The tea does not have a strong flavor, just a slight minty taste to it. It tastes like watered down mint to me (which I suppose is essentially what it is), it is not the best tasting tea out there by any means (the Vanilla flavored is better for those that are picky on taste), but it does promote relaxation for me instantly. Drinking it gives me a sense of having "me" time while still getting everything done and it somehow calms my mind. Within 20-30 minutes of finishing my cup of tea, I instantly fall asleep without dealing with a restless mind while laying in bed.<br /><br />The fact that it is all natural and doesn't "drug me" to sleep is definitely the best perk of this tea. I like that I feel relaxed enough to fall asleep instantly though I am not dead to the world. If my child wakes up, I am able to hear him and wake up which is my main reason for choosing sleepytime tea over a medicated sleep aid. It is so nice to finally get a good nights sleep and wake up without that groggy, hung-over type feeling that medications produce.<br /><br />I have been drinking sleepytime tea for about 2 years now and I do not feel the need to drink it every night (nor do I feel addicted as one reviewer mentioned). I simply keep a few boxes on hand, just in case I am having trouble winding down or for those nights when my brain does not feel like it will shut off in order for me to fall asleep.<br /><br />I am so glad I found this tea, it has truly been a lifesaver for me!

My recipe is 12 bags of tea steeped right in a 1-gal pitcher, in boiled water .  Remove the tea bags after 10 minutes or 10 hours!  Add 1 cup Real Lemon juice from the green bottle they sell in grocery stores.  1 or 1 1/4 c. sugar.  Fill pitcher to 1 gallon.  Stir, chill, and serve.

review/summary: A nice change from chamomile and it really works
review/text: Chamomile tea after dinner is a custom in Europe (can soothe over-indulged tummies) but I prefer it before bed as a sedative. The floral scent is almost hypnotic. But sometimes chamomile is boring, and SleepyTime  is delicious and very effective at calming you down.<br /><br />It contains chamomile, spearmint, West Indian lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorn and rosebuds. The Tilia is linden flower or lime blossom (not lime citrus, lime as in linden, another name for the tree.) Linden is a known relaxer and is the main constituent in French "tisane"--that tea made famous by Proust in "Remembrances of Things Past.<br /><br />The spearmint is rather prominent after the chamomile. This is a very good blend and really does serve to soothe you at the end of the day. It's also a good digestive if you've had a meal that didn't quite agree with you.

review/summary: Best "Sleeping Pill" I've ever used
review/text: I've used the Sleepy Time Tea to help me sleep for many years. I think it was close to 20 yrs ago that somebody introduced me to it. I really like the flavor of it too. There isn't much of it and it's kinda, elusive? It's there, but hard to pick out and put your finger on and say it tastes like,,? I'm not sure what to say it tastes like, but I like it hot with honey. It helps me to relax and when I've had bad acid reflux it has helped to calm my stomach. Sometimes I like to mix it with the Tension Tamer tea and put a bag of each together in a mug. Or use it with a bag of the Chamomile tea. It also makes a nice relaxing tea when you mix all three together and drink it hot or cold. I've used it to sleep but it also helps to relive a tension head ache. It helps to reduce tension from stress so that you can relax. It has also helped to reduce my lower back pain and neck pain. I've also drank it just because I like it. The best part is that its a good sleep aid that works, is not addictive, and does not have all the side effects that come with using drugs as a sleep aid.

review/summary: Celestial Seasoning Sleepytime tea
review/text: Sleep has long been a problem for me - it took many tries before I found a medication that works - however, if I took a quarter of a tablet if I needed to take a nap during the day, I would wake feeling very tired.<br /><br />I recently decided to cut back on caffeinated drinks and our favorite server at a restaurant we dine at often, suggested chamomile tea.  I found that after having it at dinner, I would have a very restful night.  So I decided to get a supply to keep at home.  When the box arrived yesterday, I decided to make myself a cup.  I lay down and fell asleep without any problem and when I woke up, I felt refreshed and didn't feel tired at all.

review/summary: Can sleep without it!
review/text: Prior to discovering the sleepytime tea, it would take me at least an hour to fall asleep and even then, I'd wake up 2-3 times throughout the night. I didn't want to take any sleep medicine because I feel like its a little risky so I looked for a more natural remedy and this tea is it! I usually drink it 30 minutes-hour before bedtime and it relaxes me and once I lay down, I'm out within minutes and can usually sleep through the night. My only advice would to be careful of the amount of liquid you consume right before lights out otherwise you'll be waking up for other reasons. Like another user observed, drinking from a small cup will do.<br />Also, I've tried other sleepy teas and so far, this is the most effective and has a light, calming taste. They also make it in vanilla which is also very good.

review/summary: Liquid Security Blanket
review/text: Aaah, a liquid security blanket.  That is what Sleepytime Herb teas are.  You get treated to a myriad of natural flavors and ingredients.  It is also good for you.  We all know that black tea is beautiful and black tea has a plethora of health properties as well.<br /><br />The teas are soothing and very gentle on your system and your tastebuds.  You don't get any caffeine in these tea products.  Instead, you find yourself enjoying the pleasant aroma and refreshingly soothing taste.  You can even drink this before bedtime - henceforth the name Sleepytime.  This "drowsy drink" will bring a smile to your face as you nod off for the night.  You can use honey with it, but I use stevia if I sweeten any tea.  Stevia is natural and you dodge the sugar bullet that way.<br /><br />I love the flowery aroma and flavors to match.  There are many health properties in tea.  I love all the delightful flavors except for mint as I never liked mint in the first place.  Barring mint, the Sleepytime line has so many delightful flavors and when you put your tea on to brew, the aroma fills your kitchen.

review/text: I do not have a terrible time sleeping, but there are those nights that you just can't get to sleep and don't want to take medication only to wake up the next morning feeling hung-over or worse than you would have if you hadn't slept at all.  I do not have insomnia, Thank God, but this helps me get a full night of restful sleep without any chemicals or medications.  Buying it by the case is much cheaper than box by box at the grocery store as well.  The taste is great, needs no sugar or creamer, so it is calorie free!  It is a wonderful, herbal remedy for those seeking to have a better, more restful night. Drinking it every night has helped make me calmer and more peaceful throughout the day.  Chamomile is proven to aid in relieving stress and anxiety, and this tea contains Chamomile as well as a few other ingredients to help you be calm and restful.  I highly recommend this product!!!

LOL There is nothing in this tea to make you sleepy really, the most "sleepy" ingredient is the chamomille, as it is a proven stomach soother, and many people feel relaxed by it. I have drunk this tea many times during the day and had no sleepy effects. If your already sleepy, and you want to be relaxed by a nice cup of sleepy tea, then it will most likely work. Im not really knocking the tea, as I do like it, but there is nothing magical about it; you take it when your already tired, and it will help you relax if you believe it will.

I wouldn't drink it without -- it just seems entirely too bitter for me to manage doing so.  When I've had a long or difficult day, I can brew a pot of Sleepytime, settle down with a book, and just forget about the rest of the world.  When I have my young granddaughters over, they love it! If you are seeking a hot beverage which is relaxing & calming/soothing with a really good spearmint/chamomile flavor (even moreso if you sweeten it with honey!), I'd say Sleepytime could very well be your "cup of tea!"

I drink Sleepytime once in a while and it really puts me to sleep quickly and I won't wake up -not even to tinkle -during the night.  I see that one reviewer cautioned about drinking this tea regularly (though the veracity of claims in that review is highly questionable).  I haven't researched the tea, but CS would not make something harmful.  Sleepytime tea has been around for decades.  On the other hand, that reviewer's caution about depending on a tea or anything else as a daily sleep aid is good advice.  Still, this tea is fabulous to drink on occasion when you want to help ensure you get a good night's sleep.  I can't say that it will work for everyone every time, but I have certainly found it very effective.<br /><br />I would also not recommend driving after drinking this tea as it really does make you sleepy quickly.  I suppose if you use this tea responsibly -as an occasional rather than daily sleep aid -you should be fine.  There is also a Sleepytime Extra (which contains Valerian... good for insomnia), but I haven't tried it as this one works wonders for me.<br /><br />If you have trouble sleeping, meditation, creative visualization, and relaxing music is also helpful.  Good luck.

review/summary: Great Natural Tea To Help You Sleep
review/text: This tea is great for adults and children. My parents used to brew natural chamomile tea with mint for me when I was a child, too. But I don't have a garden otherwise I would do it myself. I think that the reviews that say it's unsafe are strange. Does that mean that if you grew your own chamomile flowers and made your own tea, it would be okay, then?<br /><br />I think this is a great tea. I get so wired from work somethimes, and I just drink a cup of this and read a magazine or something like that, and I'm ready to sleep in an hour. It's great.

review/summary: Thank you for making this available
review/text: So often finding seed for unusual plants is difficult to impossible.  I wasn't having the best of luck in my search for Silybum Marianum, so I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  For those who are using this for health reasons, there are various ways to process the seeds.  Seed mills are frequently available at Asian food stores.  And searching here on Amazon, I found both a "seed oil press" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QU3CLC">L'Equip Omni Juicer with Seed Oil Extractor</a> and a seed mill <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004YK5S">William Bounds Electric Flax Seed Mill, White</a>.  For the DIY types among you, it isn't hard to fabricate your own - especially if you happen to have a shop press already on hand.  Adding some gentle heat may improve your yield, just don't overdo it.<br /><br />As with so many other plants, you'll want to keep the spreading in check, as it could end up where you don't want it.  If you have a greenhouse available, that is great. Otherwise, try to avoid unwanted propagation.  Unlike some soreheaded types who seem to hold you all in low esteem, I believe most folks shopping here are responsible, and that they aren't likely to wreck the countryside with these seeds, or be at a loss for processing them.  Especially since there is a trick to getting this stuff to germinate.  If you know (or can learn) the trick, you probably know enough to be a responsible grower.<br /><br />Enjoy, and good health.

review/summary: Class A Noxious Weed
review/text: This plant is a class A noxious weed in Washington State, and with very good reason.  Bad choice for a garden as it spreads unmercifully, and the entire plants are nasty sharp and spiny, the flower heads could be used as weapons.<br />While it is true that Milk Thistle has very beneficial medicinal qualities, it is too difficult for the average person to obtain the extract.  Just purchase it at the health food store and save yourself the ugly science project experience.<br />PS to the seller:  you should know better.

review/summary: Pretty good on a salad
review/text: Bacos aren't bacon; they don't taste nearly as good.  On the other hand, check out the nutrition facts. Very little fat (no saturated fat), little sodium, little carbohydrates, no cholesterol.  I'd rather have something that gives me some of the flavor of bacon without the fat and so on (as much as I love the real thing!).<br /><br />This adds a nice taste to salad, and it can be used in certain other recipes.<br /><br />So, while it's not great, it does do the trick.

review/summary: A Very Good Bacon Replacement (Vegetarian)
review/text: I'm not a vegetarian but I've been eating Bac-Os for years. While it's very true that they don't taste exactly like bacon, they don't really have to because they taste pretty good themselves. They were originally marketed as a salad topping, in place of bacon bits if you like, and then found to be tasty on many other things. I like them on/in baked potatoes, pancakes, eggs, and just about anywhere else I want some little crunchy smokey&salty flavored treats. They are a hell of a lot more conventient than bacon, and cheaper than bacon bits in a jar. Probably safer too, as I'm not too sure how long real bacon bits are good for even covered in salt and in a jar.<br /><br />Anyway, Bac-Os have always been very good for what they are and I'm glad that Betty Crocker still makes them.<br /><br />Amazon does indeed sell things that are close to their expiration date but I don't think it matters with this one.

review/text: What is the point of this product? What genius invented it?<br />Actual bacon is healthier than what goes into this product! Yuch.<br /><br />Defatted Soy Flour, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Water, Salt, Sugar, Artificial and Natural Flavor, Red 40 and Other Color Added, Soy Sauce (Water, Wheat, Soybeans, Salt), Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Corn, Soy, Wheat).<br /><br />Soy is not particularly healthy and for men can actually act as the female hormone estrogen. Eat too much and you'll develop man-breasts!<br />Hydrogenated oil is a carcinogen.<br />Sugar is poison.<br />Artificial flavor and colors aren't food, it's chemicals.<br />Hydrolyzed foods are not food.<br /><br />Pure fatty bacon is far healthier in moderation. This is a stupid product consumed only by those who don't look at ingredients and think.

review/summary: Our go to fast food
review/text: We order this by the case and probably go through 2 or 3 cases for a family of three in a year. It's healthy, really tasty and better than any dal I've ever ordered at an Indian restaurant (or that I've made).  It's quick and easy, open the can, add some water, heat it up and eat. It's great over rice.  It's primarily the little black dal with a few kidney beans thrown in. It's not particularly spicy although we have noticed that occasional cans are a bit spicier than others. The dal is never "hot" spiced, but it is flavorful. Often, we'll get Indian food from a restaurant and supplement it with this dal because the quality is quite impressive.  You can make it more or less spicy by increasing or reducing the water and you can add yogurt if you really want to tame it.

review/summary: Not sure if this is a rock or a tooth?
review/text: I enjoy foods and dishes of a wide variety of origins, other than the basic bachelor mainstay of Mcdonalds and Dominos and HungryMan. Fastfood is fun on occasion, but, frankly, let's face it, fastfood is the worst form of unnatural, chemically infused, fat blistering, evil to ever be massed produced for human being consumption. Anyone who thinks otherwise was, like me, kidding themselves to the n'th power. But, enough of what a clown would feed you and on to what i was hoping to get from Jyoti Natural Foods "Dal Makhani, Aromatic Lentils and Beans". Nutrition, without addivites, and f.o.d.<br /><br />Well today while removing the contents of the above mentioned product from it's can i found what appears to be a tooth, it looks like a tooth OR a tooth shaped rock. I'm not sure, and seriously questioning the act of preparing a dish with this one container. This is by no means a joke or some tripe attempt at defamation of JYOTi, and do enjoy their products and will probably continue to use them, as soon as i can resolve the origin of this mysterious object.<br /><br />In summary i think that food is important to a healthy life. And I do struggle with this fact everyday. And i do enjoy food that edifies my body. That in mind I'm probably over reacting to finding this object in my can, but dangit that looks like a tooth.<br /><br />I've read the reviews and must say thanks to everyone that posted on this product. It's the only way we can stay informed and empower each other. Even if the posts disagree, their there and posted for us to review and contemplate.

review/text: I am a great fan of Dal Makhani and would rate the stuff among my favorite choices when dining at an Indian restaurant. As a great fan of Indian food, I was excited to learn that Amazon carried several brands of dal and ordered a case. Sorry to say this particular brand is hard to eat, very much like a thick paste (is it really food?).  My wife and daughter, who generally like Indian food cannot stand this stuff either.  I will be donating this food-like product to my local food bank, perhaps they can find someone to eat it. Amazon sells other brands of Dal Makhani (e.g., MTR) which I will continue to purchase. Sympathies to anyone who purchases this stuff.

review/summary: M&M's going coconuts . . .
review/text: For some, the Limited Edition, Coconut flavored M&M's, can be addictive.  Chocolate with a pretty distinct coconut flavor, that is yummy consuming either fast or slow.  The candies are shaped similar to regular M&M's, but are about 40% larger.  You get a bigger shot of chocolate, but at this size, quality control may be a little lax, as the shape and sizes of the pieces vary a bit.  The color scheme for the sweets, is dark brown, white, and green.<br /><br />These comments pertain to the product itself, and not the 18.6 ounce size package in particular.  Most know, that Amazon is not the ideal place find a bargain for food items.  As a guide, an 11.8 ounce bag of coconut M&M's, can probably be purchased for between three and four dollars.<br /><br />Who knows how long this `limited edition' will be available, so if you want to try them, you might want to do it soon.

review/summary: Saved from pain and suffering by this stuff.
review/text: I was having heavy withdrawals from a narcotic pain medication. I was literally on my death bed! My nervous and immune systems were were on the edge of shutting down completely. I took the narcotic meds for back pain for 12 months. Little did I know how they would cause life threatening illness once I stopped taking them. This stuff saved my life. After just 3 days of drinking this tea, I am almost back to normal again. I have energy again, alot of it! The tea has Astragalus, jasmine, and green tea in it. I'd say the Astragalus is what did the job, as I drink green tea often and have had no help from it. I recommend this product to anyone with any health problems. I was so sick, and now I'm like normal again. It boosts your immune system hardcore!

review/summary: A Special Jerk Gift
review/text: When you are looking for something different for that special jerky loving friend, check this one out. The people at Choo Choo Snacks have outdone themselves with the 50-Piece Sampler Backpack Cooker. Their attention to quality and detail is consistent and innovative. The jerky is always fresh and tasty. These are the full size packages too, not those silly little bite size products that look much bigger in the picture! The backpack cooler is well made and useful. I never worry when I send gifts through Choo Choo - I know they will be enjoyed and appreciated.

review/summary: Great variety but some flavors too salty
review/text: Most of the stick jerkys are good (some of them are quite long), but I found some smaller bagged kinds (not the premium) a bit too salty and not much flavor.  It may just be me because my friend said it tasted fine. Maybe I just got an extra salty batch.<br /><br />The jerky is moist and chewy with some unique flavors (honey stung and pickled sausage come to mind).  For a complete listing of flavors, you can go to Choo Choo R Snacks Inc's website.  This pack contains 50 pieces of 32 different flavors.<br /><br />If you want to get a taste of the different varieties that Buffalo Bills has to offer, this is a great option.  It even came with a free sample of their Supreme Coconut Bar!

review/summary: Makes you look forward to winter
review/text: We love this stuff, especially in cold weather; however, compare prices before you buy, it should be under $5/jar. I sometimes make Asian-inspired soups from scratch, but this offers a perfect balance of flavors and is of course much easier. This is Thai H&S, which tastes different from Chinese. I usually add some sriracha or chile-garlic paste for extra heat, and some Better Than Buillon soup base (another excellent product) for deeper flavor, but it's fine as is. Just keep adding some a teaspoon at a time until you get the flavor you want, then throw in meat, seafood, eggs, tofu, vegies, Asian (or Italian) pasta, rice--whatever you have on hand--and voila! A very delicious, nutritious, and satisfying meal in under 30 minutes. It's no more difficult than instant ramen, but much cheaper and tastier.

If you are looking for a great roast from the islands, go with someting Rusty's Hawaiian.

review/text: It's totally my guilty pleasure. It tastes as good (if not better) than the local Tim Hortons AND IT COMES OUT OF A PACKET! It's instant coffee! WHY IS THIS SO GOOD? IT DEFIES ALL LOGIC!<br /><br />I haven't yet found a better vietnamese instant coffee - the G20 brand is quite comparable, but this one seems to be better priced, as you get a lot more coffee powder per packet - which makes for a stronger taste. A single packet of the Vinacaf&eacute; will make a pretty big mug of tasty coffee, while trying to do the same with the G20 results in something far more watery.<br /><br />Even though it's a 3-in-1, including sugar and a creamer with it, I still top up the remaining 1/4 of my cup with milk and a couple tablespoons of amaretto. It's hard NOT to drink the whole concoction down in one swig.

Their factory is on one of the main roads between Bien Hoa (where the air base is/was) and Long Binh where the Army supply center was.  I know I've driven by that place a number of times in 1968.

You can probably create this seasoning pretty easily by yourself for less money, but the pre-mixed packet is nice for lazy people who don't have lots of different ingredients lying around in their kitchen.

review/summary: Special corn translates to special polenta
review/text: Hello.  My name is Carl Mundt and I am the President of the company that produces de la Estancia organic polenta in Argentina - I'm obviously biased so you can take my comments with a grain of salt if you want.<br /><br />A little more than 10 years ago, my wife and I decided to invest in the Argentine farming business.  We found two young Argentine farmers to be our partners and we began to grow different crops.  I also started to learn something about farming - I was especially interested in the crops themselves.  After a few years I realized that the corn we were growing was quite different from the corn I was used to seeing in the US and Europe.  Argentine corn is a subtropical corn called "long cycle" which meant that it grows in the fields for 6 months as opposed to the 3 month growing cycle of common corn.  It was also extremely happy corn because the nights in the foothills of the Andes are cool and, besides lots of rain and hot sunshine, corn likes cool nights.  This special type of corn is much harder, more vividly yellow and has both a much lower starch content and a higher protein level than corn from more temperate climates.<br /><br />Putting two and two together I realized that polenta made from Argentine corn would be far superior to polenta made from common corn.  It would be brighter yellow in color and it could be ground to a finer consistency.  But most important, the low starch level meant that our polenta would cook in just one minute.  It cooks so fast because there is basically no starch to incorporate into the cooking liquid.  That is what takes so long in cooking other polentas.<br /><br />I also want to emphasize that our polenta is not pre-cooked as is the case for the polenta in the tubes.  Nor it is partially pre-cooked and then reconstituted as is the case for the "instant" polentas.  De la Estancia polenta is pure ground corn that has never been processed or treated in any way.  It just cooks fast naturally.<br /><br />I hope that you enjoy preparing and serving our polenta as much as I have enjoyed bringing it to the US.

review/text: smooth,great mouth feel, taste, easy to prepare, works well in cornmeal muffins and other baking. Best polenta I've ever had. If you like polenta you should really try this because this is not just another polenta.<br /><br />  This is made with long cycle corn which takes longer to grow, is not genetically modified, has less starch, and makes a better polenta.<br /><br />  Long cycle corn is closer to what original corn used to be before it was bred to grow quick. This corn is only able to grow in a few parts of the world. This particular corn is grown in Argentina in view of the Andes Mountains.<br /><br />thank you for making this product available Amazon.

Bob's Red Mill polenta can be ready in ten minutes and doesn't strike us as pasty. The flavor of De la Estancia is excellent though. I have begun to use it instead of fine cornmeal in baked goods. For example, Martha Stewart has a wonderful,  simple recipe for a blackberry cornmeal cake.

review/summary: really like this stuff
review/text: My perspective on this product comes from having visited Bergamo, Italy many times and eaten the polenta there.  I don't have the time or energy to cook polenta like they do there (cooper pot, constant stirring, open fire).  But this product is a delicious alternative.

review/summary: My favorite polenta
review/text: This polenta has a great flavor and cooks in less than five minutes.  The texture is creamy and not too grainy.  I love that it's organic, especially since corn is one of the most genetically modified crops.  This polenta is super with sun-dried tomatoes, basil, and garlic for dinner, and it's great for breakfast with fresh blueberries mixed in and a light pouring of maple syrup.  I've tried other polenta brands, and this one is definitely the smoothest.

review/summary: Boy filling, insulin dependent friendly staple food
review/text: I recently purchased this polenta and have been using it for meals while hiking.  This product is absolutely fabulous.  As a type I diabetic I can attest to the lower starch content.  Lower starch content does not mean this stuff is not a powerhouse. It just means that blood sugar raises in a less dramatic, more linear fashion.  I eat more of it at lunch and less at dinner.  The taste of the polenta is pleasing in and of itself but is neutral enough to accept any type of spice you want to add.  Think of it like rice in that way.  It cooks in a snap.  I boil water, add polenta and stir until it is firm.  It will take a time or two to dial in the amount you add for the water you've boiled but it's no big deal.  This is a staple food.  I now carry this polenta, basic spices, some protein (like the Spam and tuna you get in packages rather than tin cans), Snickers bars for when I need that "quick hit" and I live well.  An entirely enjoyable product that delivers when it comes to consistent and sustained energy/blood sugar levels.  It's a boy filler and it leaves little to no residue.  I tend to boil up a cup of water for instant coffee after lunch and dinner adding dried milk and black cane sugar (can you say yummy boys and girls)and that is all the cleaning my trail pot needs after a polenta meal.  Love it, love it, love it.

review/summary: Polenta
review/text: This polenta is excellent. As I am northern Italian and eat a lot of polenta I will not purchase polenta made in the US because of 90% of corn products being genetically modified. I certainly recommend this product to anyone.

review/summary: Wow
review/text: Ok - this is great. It cooks really fast and tastes great. I really do not know what else to say - I have made a lot of different polentas and grits and cornmeal things and the texture of this and the speed it cooks at is really amazing. And it tastes great. With broth. with water with sauce. with butter. YUM.

review/summary: Tastes fantastic!
review/text: This polenta has a very creamy texture, much like that of cream of wheat. It has a very mild corn flavor that i would not consider sweet like some other polenta brands. We have been cooking it in chicken broth, and then adding some sauteed peppers and grated parmesan cheese. It's a big hit with the family, and i would order this product again.

review/summary: This isn't pabulum fodder
review/text: De la Estancia Organic Polenta is the best polenta I have ever purchased.  I wanted a fine grind to shorten the cooking time, especially in my solar cooker.  It was also interesting to read in the description that the corn has a long growing season: there has to be a good reason for that--more trace nutrients? better taste? heirloom seed?  The taste is great and well incorporated into favorite recipes.  A great purchase!
