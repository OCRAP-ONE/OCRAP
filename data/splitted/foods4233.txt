review/text: We were having a lot of trouble giving our kitty her heart medicine which was in pill form.  After talking to a friend that had the same problem, she told us about pill pockets.  She even gave us a few to try and the problem was solved.  We now are not fighting our kitty to take her medicine.  Now we are all happy.

review/summary: Taste great but wish they were fresher.
review/text: These are my wife's favorite crackers. She has been unable to locate them locally, so we bought them from Amazon. As with some of the esoteric food items I've bought from Amazon, they are out of date. In this case the crackers were as crisp as they should be, so I didn't deduct a star. We got them March 20th, and the package said best if used by March 15th. We had to get 12 boxes, so I hope they stay fresh until they are gone. If not I will update this review.

review/summary: The real deal
review/text: This product is wonderful!  I have nothing to compare it to, but I had wanted to start making my own pizza's at home and decided to try using high gluten flour.  So far, the product has performed wonderfully each time I have used it.  I've made about 1/2 dozen pizzas using my own dough recipe and it has delivered each time.  The 5 lb. size is nice, as it is hard to find anything less than 25 lb. bags.  Price per pound compared to King Arthur's high gluten flour, it is about the same but slightly less, even with shipping & handling charges.  Overall rating: EXCELLENT!

review/summary: This type of flour is a big secret behind great pizza and breads!
review/text: Barry Farms High Gluten flour makes incredible pizza, French Bread and other breads.<br /><br />This flour is the kind that responds best to a BAKING STONE or PIZZA STONE.<br />(That is the other big secret to great pizza & breads).<br /><br />Basically, with HG flour, a baking stone and using high temps (i.e. pre-heating<br />the stone at high heat for a full hour before starting baking), and with a little reading & practice,<br />you can make better pizza than most of your favorite pizzerias.<br /><br />For typical pizza/French bread dough, I like a 3-2 mix with regular store flour (3 parts HG Flour<br />to 2 of regular flour), although other combinations get good results too.<br /><br />I like Barry Farms' products--They arrive fresh & make great, quality ingredients<br />to many recipes.<br /><br />Even just simple dinner rolls made with this flour & baked on an oven stone will impress your friends.

review/summary: Love good pizza crust?
review/text: I use Barry Farm's high-gluten flour for making pizza crust.  The high-gluten is what separates the great pizza restaurants from the dry, dense homemade pizza crust we are all used to.  Replacing your standard flour mixture with Berry Farm's high-gluten four will give your crust that chewy, fluffy, and stretchy, texture that is so difficult to get with any other flour.  You will not regret your purchase.  I promise.

review/text: I am a vegan and finding sweet things to snack on is not always easy.  I stumbled across these on another health food site and thought I would see if Amazon offered them- they did and with prime shipping I couldn't resist!  I ordered the chocolate chip flavor and while these are good they aren't great.  They are a little hard and you can't tell from the photo but they are just a few notches bigger than a Famous Amos cookie.  I bought these thinking I would have them in my house for a while - I didn't realize how small they were.<br /><br />All in all if you are a vegan or someone with severe food allergies, these will be a welcomed addition to your pantry.

I purchased it locally in Chicago and liked it so much that I figured I'd check Amazon so I could have a few bottles shipped to me on vaction. Unfortunately the resellers on Amazon only have it available by the case and the price it completely outragious (119.95 for 12). So they want $10 a bottle. I can get it at the grocery store for $4 a bottle. Oh well.

review/summary: These are great! So happy my son can have some lollis!
review/text: First off, you must know that a 30 pack of these lollis at Whole Foods is $4.99, so this is a steal. I love that they have added Vit C., because I only let my children have lollis if they do something REALLY special, or when they're sick.<br />My middle son has ADHD and we've had wild success following the Feingold Diet for him. That being said, finding candy that has zero artificial food coloring and no processed sugar is really hard to do. Enter Yummy Earth, and they save the day!<br />Also, the fact that they are labeled VEGAN is a big deal, as now I know that they do not have Castoreum in them for the cherry/strawberry flavoring. Castoreum is beaver anal gland juice, and it is considered a "natural flavor" according to the USDA.  It's nasty, and the only way you know for sure you're not eating anal juice is if the product is labeled VEGAN.  I am not opposed to eating meat at all - but anal juice? Really? Why not use the real berry or vanilla bean for the flavoring? Who thought of tasting and then using anal gland juice?<br /><br />Here is the breakdown of what we received:<br />326 lollis (well, 327, but one did not have a wrapper on it, so it went to the trash).<br />Apple -25<br />Cherry - 35<br />Pomegranate - 41<br />Grape -46<br />Blueberry - 50<br />Strawberry - 48<br />Watermelon - 41<br />Mango - 40<br /><br />My husband doesn't like the watermelon, but my kids & I enjoy them all!

I do not eat candy or sweets regularly (the kids and husband do), but I was looking for something to snack on that was gluten free, low in calories, all natural, organic, and relatively healthy. These suckers are perfect for that. I can eat three suckers for only 70 calories, and I only eat maybe two in a day. These would be good for dieters, people looking to quit smoking, and kids. Of course, real fruit is the best, but these make a great occasional treat. Great value for the price.

Then I realized it's the roughness as I sucked on them, so I try to remember to let them more or less melt, but quite honestly, it takes a little of the enjoyment out of suckers. Someone else called it grittiness, but I'm just not sure what causes it.

review/summary: Lollipops! &lt;3
review/text: These came in the mail fast. Opened them the day of. And I counted the number of lollipops for each flavor. I am happy to say that there is a very equal distribution of each flavor. 41 sour apple, 42 pomegranate pucker, 40 googly grape, 40 very very cherry, 40 tooberry blueberry, 41 strawberry smash, 41 wetface watermelon, and 41 mango tango. Making it a total of 325.  There were 5 of these that weren't completely perfect. And the WEIRD thing about these vitamin C pops is that they have a GRITTY feel to them as you are licking. And you can see the grits too.  I don't know if it's the vitamin C powder they add to it or what. But the grittiness of the lollipop detracts from the sweet flavor. Other than the grittiness of the lollipop, everything is perfect.

review/summary: Perfect for Toddler and Mommy!!
review/text: Best Lollipops by far!!<br /><br />Thanks in large part to my daughter's "PopPop" (Grandfather), she developed an obsession with lollipops...specifically, tootsie-roll blow pops. She is almost 3 yrs old so she has mastered the "sweet angel" face which she uses to get whatever she wants from her grandparents. So, I decided the best thing I could do was find a product that wasnt loaded with refined sugar and unhealthy dyes. I found these while searching and I am so happy I did!<br /><br />These lollipops are the PERFECT size for little mouths (and economical since they arent often thrown away half-eaten) and they are filled with guilt-free organic ingredients! Since my daughter goes to daycare, the added Vitamin C is a major plus. Obviously, candy isnt at the top of any healthy food list but when you are looking for an item to curb the little sweet tooth, these are great! I have tried every flavor myself and they are ALL awesome! I originally purchased them for my little one but I often find myself dipping into the bag...Im glad I opted for the 5 pounder!

review/summary: Best Lolli's Ever
review/text: I will be ordering these pops regularly from now on.<br /><br />They taste amazing, are organic, actually have some nutritional value, and are only around 25 calories each.<br /><br />I'm doing my best to switch the family to a chemical free diet, with as much organic content as possible.  Just try and read the ingredient/chemical list on a bag of regular pops.

review/summary: These lacked flavor, and now I am stuck with a 5-lb bag!
review/text: After buying the plain and regular YummyEarth lollipops (those were absolutely delicious!, I purchased this 5-lb bag of lollipops with the added vitamin c. I thought the addition of the vitamin c was a good thing, but after I received the bag, well, these just lacked the flavor of the other plain ones. Maybe I got an old bag, or maybe the added vitamin c kills the flavor, but these were lousy - very flavorless.  I sure hope it is not a production consistency issue.<br /><br />My kids loved the plain simple organic lollipops. These with the vitamin c, they are not going crazy over. The bag has not been touched since we first got it. I will not be buying these again. I will be buying the regular plain organic ones, but not these with the vitamin c.<br /><br />Now I am stuck with a 5-lb bag of lollipops that the kids don't want.

review/summary: Instant vomiting
review/text: I normally give my cats the occasional treat of tuna from Solid Gold, which has always worked great.<br />It has some dark tuna mush and also some nice bites of clearer, solid fish.<br /><br />For a change I thought I would try Tiki tuna, since they are supposed to be high end... When I opened the can it was pure red mush.<br />No white flesh whatsoever, and smelled really strong. The cats all started eating it, and within twenty seconds 3 out of the 4 threw up right there and then, in their unfinished plates!<br />When three out of four cats vomit at the same time, while eating the same food, you know you have a problem.<br />Even my "steel stomach" cat threw up  his whole meal minutes later.<br /><br />Never getting that brand again, and returning all the cans asap.

Timothy's Midnight Magic --> BY FAR my favorite!<br />2. Green Mountain Dark Magic<br />3. Emeril's Extra Bold<br /><br />That being said, some people don't like the strong taste of coffee so take my advice only if you are a strong coffee drinker.

review/text: I found this to be a pleasantly strong dark coffee; it was rich and smooth without being at all bitter.  However, as I tend to prefer my coffee on the milder side, I am not sure that this would appeal to TRUE dark coffee lovers--i.e., what was good for me might not be right for someone looking for something stronger.  Overall, however, I would recommend this coffee.

Add warm water, stir and you will have one happy dog.  It smells good and when one of the dogs was sick, this was the only thing she would eat.  The cats even try to get some!  Lot's of chicken in this food.  The chickpeas add fiber to the diet making it easier to pick up after the dog on walks too.  It's pricey, but if you use it to supplement kibble it can last a long time.

review/text: I ordered a small bag of this to try out as we like popcorn occasionally.  Received it and followed the directions to pop it stovetop.  Lots of kernels left unpopped, but not an overly unacceptable amount.  Sprinkled some salt on it, and tried it.<br /><br />Not only ARE there hulls left on the popcorn, the popped amount is so small that all you can taste are the hulls!  Other reviews stated that this tasted sweeter than normal popcorn, and we have to disagree.  It tasted plain, and the hulls really bothered me.  Harder than normal popped corn, it was very disappointing.<br /><br />I'm very glad that I only ordered a small bag of this, as it will probably get thrown out.  Unacceptable to us and a waste of money.  Everyone's taste may vary, but we'll take normal-sized popcorn for our snacking needs.

review/summary: Love that smell and taste!
review/text: Most of my family comes from Louisiana or other southern states and we all enjoy gulf coast seafood, especially shrimp, crab and crawfish.  We all prefer Zatarain's boil over home mixes or Old Bay.  It is spicy and infuses a lovely flavor in foods.  I even add a little of the boiled water to gumbos and jambalayas as it enhances the spices I add myself.  It is equally good used in red beans and rice or boiled dinners of cabbage, potatoes, onions and meats such as kielbasa or beef.  When I moved to Alaska I had Zatarain's boil shipped to me.  Now living n Philadelphia it is getting harder and harder to find in stores, especially the dry mix in a bag, which I find superior to the bottled concentrate even though it is also better than anything else I can buy.<br /><br />Great stuff that is a versatile cooking spice blend that adds a little kick to more recipes than you would expect.  You will need to experiment with it to decide how strong you want the boil mix as it is peppery. The longer you leave the bag in boiling water before you add seafood plays a part in determining the spiciness of the flavor that results. I prefer very spicy food but I have never found that I had to use more than the recommended amount of the boil.  I do not add salt when using frozen seafood since the result is often too salty for me.

review/summary: Zatarain's Crawfish, Shrimp, and Crab Boil
review/text: I've been using Zatarain's Crawfish, Shrimp and Crab Boil for many years, principally for boiling shrimp. It contains a mixture of spices and herbs that impart a fantastic flavor and I prefer it to Old Bay seasoning for boiling shrimp. It recently became unavailable at my local stores, so I ordered a case of 24 from Amazon. It was delivered in a timely way, just in time to prepare shrimp for Superbowl Sunday.<br /><br />An excellent product!

review/text: I have used this product for many years while living on the Texas coast and having a neverending supply of fresh crabs and shrimp at my back door.  However friends I visited recently in Michigan say they cannot buy it and asked if I would send some for a "fish boil" party they were planning.  By all accounts the party was a success and the seasoning was perfect.<br /><br />I have found all of Zatarain's products to be of very high quality.

review/summary: Roland Grapeseed Oil Great for MANY Things and Came Packaged PERFECTLY . . .
review/text: If you look at the reviews for other grapeseed oils, there seems to be a problem with packaging and delivery.  I am happy to report that Roland Grapeseed Oil came packaged PERFECTLY.<br /><br />I love this oil.<br /><br />I particularly like that it is a healthy oil AND when pan-frying, it doesn't smoke as easily as other oils I've used, such as olive oil.<br /><br />Also, if you want to use an oil that will not change the flavor of the food you are frying, grapeseed oil is neutral and blends well with everything from stove-top popped popcorn to salad.<br /><br />Grapeseed oil is also a wonderful massage oil, skin moisturizer and hair conditioner.  For hair, I warm about 2 tablespoons of grapeseed oil in the microwave for about 15 seconds, and then I apply it to dry hair.  I let it set for 15 minutes, then shampoo, rinse, and condition as usual.<br /><br />There are many lotions and hair products I cannot use because I am highly gluten sensitive, but grapeseed oil is a gluten-free, natural skin softener and conditioner.<br /><br />I'm hooked, and because Roland came at a nice price and packaged so perfectly, I will continue to order Roland.

review/summary: nice, unique flavor
review/text: I love the opaque cans this oil comes in. My current go-to oils are coconut, macadamia nut, sesame and grapeseed. How much flavor an oil has seems to do with how highly it is processed and refined. I like an oil that has some flavor (tasty flavor not gone-rancid flavor, of course) since to me that says it hasn't been processed into something unhealthy. This oil definitely fits that description and the flavor is reminiscent of chewing on a grape leaf (I heard grape leaves are really good for you - good to put in a green smoothie - so I was chewing one out in the garden.) Because of the flavor it doesn't go with everything. Wonderful for salad dressings, I like the flavor when cooking a veggie burger but it tasted really weird on a grilled sandwich I made. It has a bit of a green flavor. Next time I'm going to try macadamia nut oil for that, since it's supposed to have a buttery taste.

review/text: Extra virgin olive oil is the darling of foodies and nutritionists, but it has too much flavor to scramble eggs in, smokes at high temperatures, and overpowers vinaigrettes made with delicate sour things like champagne vinegar or fruit juices. Grapeseed oil to the rescue. It's supposed to have plenty of the same good things EVOO has -- antioxidants and healthy lipids, and none of the supposedly bad things like saturated fat that butter has. A great utility player!

review/summary: Terribly weak
review/text: We love Hazlenut coffee, so we figured that the Gloria Jean version would be great. Boy, were we wrong...... This was the weakest coffee (really slightly tinted brown water) that we have ever tried. After the first K-cup, we tried, the coffee was so weak, I thought that I had done something wrong. And the coffee tasted like hot water. So I made a second cup and watched the coffee as it came out of the Keurig. The last half of the brew was just clear water..... Terrible.<br /><br />So I grabbed a Green Mountain K-Cup and shook it. I could hear the coffee moving around inside and felt the weight compared the Gloria Jean. No comparison, The Gloria Jean was as light as a feather.<br /><br /> We packed up the rest of the box and sent it back. I don't know what to make of this. Maybe we got a bad batch.

review/text: If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled "lemon ginger green tea." It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.

review/summary: Great Green Tea and Great Company!
review/text: This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several "natural" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using "natural" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them.

review/summary: Excellent Green Tea from a real Tea drinker!
review/text: I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional "Gyokuro" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping.

review/summary: Interesting blend
review/text: My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct "earl grey" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product.

It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!

review/text: *****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy.

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!

review/summary: Great Green Tea!
review/text: I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new "everyday" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days.
