review/summary: lotsa  delicious crumbs
review/text: no complaints on the quality of cookies.out of  9 cookies in a box i only came across 4 sometimes 5 whole cookies. the rest were all crumbled to pieces and i had to use a coffee spoon to enjoy the rest of the crumbs. I could see 1 or 2 boxes in this bad condition but all of them ?  YIKES !!! I hesitate to order it again. I was gonna use 2 boxes as gifts but just not gonna happen. I wonder if  AMAZON got a good deal from the company. That's why the 3 stars otherwise it would have been a 5 stars.

review/summary: Before I was Gluten Intolerant
review/text: I bought these cookies for some friends of mine who were celiac and coming to a potluck. Of course I had to try one and I was so happy that they tasted, to me, like pecan sandies, which I love. Since I have become gluten intolerant myself and enjoy these cookies as a treat now and then.  I feel fortunate to have quality products such as Pamela's to ease my transition to a fully gluten free diet.

review/summary: Best cookie ever!
review/text: I must eat gluten free. That usually means eating things that may not be as good as regular wheat products. Not true in the case of these wonderful pecan shortbread cookies. They are absolutely the best cookie of this type that I have ever eaten. As a matter of fact, they are almost addictive. I don't know when to stop eating them.

review/summary: Yummy shortbread cookie whether or not you need gluten free.
review/text: Besides the fact that Amazon Subscribe and Save lets me get these for a more reasonable price whenever I want, they are completely yummy and a great crumbly texture whether or not you need something gluten free. (No soy or corn either!) You can proudly serve them to guests except those with nut allergies. I do wish Pamela's would offer just this cookie without the nuts. They do have a half chocolate/half vanilla variety, but I'm supposed to stay away from chocolate. The lemon style is good when you're in the mood, but sour kind of overpowers sweet with those defeating the purpose if you're craving something sweet.

review/summary: CRUMB PROBLEM SOLVED...
review/text: Whatever issues Amazon was having with shipping before, they seemed to have fixed the problem. I received a full case, not one broken cookie. These are delicious and taste just like regular buttery shortbread.<br />However, they are LOADED with fat and calories (each cookie has 8 gm fat and over 200 calories!). Who eats just one cookie? Then, you're looking at way too much for just a snack. So, if you have incredible self control or are very skinny, order up!

review/summary: Great tasting cookie crumbs!
review/text: I've bought these cookies before at my local grocery store but I was looking to get them at a better price.  So when I saw they were available at Amazon, I immediately bought a box without first reading the other reviews.  If I had, I would have seen that others experienced the same problem I did, namely, most of the cookies were broken up upon arrival. Which was a pity because these are delicious cookies and I highly recommend them - just don't buy them from Amazon. I wanted to give this item 5 stars because it's such a great tasting cookie, however due to the shipping problems I can only give it 3.  Sorry, Amazon - I've bought a lot of stuff from you over the years and will continue to do so but this is one item that I'm going to have to buy locally again.

review/text: My mom has celiac disease, so her cookie choices are very limited.  However, she loves these cookies and has me order them for her from Amazon on a regular basis.  She even uses them to make a no-bake pie crust for a French silk chocolate pie.  Her only complaint is that the cookies always arrive broken and the cookie boxes are poorly packed inside the shipping boxes.  The crumbled ones go for pie crusts.  The good news is that means more pie for us :)  Also, shipping is always faster than projected.

They are GREAT (the best gluten-free cookies out there in my opinion), but when they arrived from Amazon they were all broken into pieces.  They still taste great--they just don't look too pretty.  I give the cookies a 5 but the shipping a 1.  Better to pay more and buy them in the store if you want them to still be considered "cookies" (rather than crumbs) when you open the package.

review/summary: The most delicious tuna on Earth.
review/text: I used to eat a ton of tuna.<br />I'm 37 years old...do any of you remember what tuna was like when we were little?<br />It was actually chunky and looked like something that came from a living creature?<br />Then somewhere along the line "chunk" tuna literally started looking like cat food.<br />You'd open the can to drain the water and half the tuna would spill out with the water.<br />It's revolting.<br />Then upon further research (Google LOL)..... I found out that the majority of tuna makers started using a variety of Tuna called "Skip Jack".<br />They're still tuna but much smaller and less expensive.<br />That's why tuna looks like cat food nowadays.<br />If you want the good stuff, you have to get the solid chunk tuna.<br />It's more expensive but it's worth it.<br />Then one fine day I saw the Bumblebee Thai and figured it would taste like spicy cat food.<br />Man was I WRONG!!!<br />I went from a tuna lover to a tuna hater and back again.<br />This tuna is the ultimate treat.<br />It's spicy but not overly hot.<br />It's simply delicious in salad.<br />It's probably the only tuna I can literally eat right out of the can.<br />I cannot rave enough about this particular brand of tuna.<br />Spicy<br />Delicious<br />A home run for Bumblebee.<br />Highly recommended.

You can usually pick it up for $3.00 or less a can or even closer to $2 a can at HEB in Texas.<br /><br />The product is good, but I would look for a source locally before trying to buy at Amazon.

This was just six individual cans thrown into a box with NO packing material so they could fly around during shipping and damage some of the seals.  In addition the price is ludicrous (my fault I didn't read quantity more closely).  This is DOUBLE the price per can over my local Safeway Food store.  Of course this item is not returnable.  This is a major rip off.  Avoid this item unless the price is about half of this rip off.  I can't believe Amazon would allow a vendor on their site treat a customer like this.<br /><br />The product itself is very good; it is just this price and packaging that you want to avoid.

review/text: My mother is a huge believer in home remedies, in herbs and plants to help soothe away your aches and pains. Burn your hand? Break off a bit of the aloe plant. Stomach ache? A soothing tea made of sarsaparilla root (which is apparently kinda dangerous...oops). My minor in college was Folklore, and I love this kind of stuff, different plants that supposedly help with different aches...I've seen it firsthand in my wife. She gets crazy bad migraines, and a good cup of mint tea can help her keep things under control. But I love the Red Leaf Teas website, especially their matchas, that list everything the plant involved in the flavoring can do. Take this tea for instance:<br /><br />Did you know that studies showed that pomegranate juice destroys breast cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone? It may also prevent breast cancer cells from forming.<br />Pomegranates also offer the following benefits to list a few :<br />Lung Cancer Prevention<br />Slows Prostate Cancer<br />Keeps PSA Levels Stable<br />Protects the Neonatal Brain<br />Prevention of Osteoarthritis<br />Protects the Arteries<br />Alzheimer's Disease Prevention<br />Lowers Cholesterol<br />Lowers Blood Pressure<br />Dental Protection<br />taken from the Red Leaf Teas website.<br /><br />Now, part of me just brushes most of that off, but the part of me that is my mother's hippie daughter drinks this matcha just in case. My aunt recently started chemo to deal with her breast cancer, and one of the things that helped speed up the end of my grandmother's life was breast cancer, so I don't mess around with it. If there's even a slight possibility something might help prevent breast cancer in my body, I'm there. I've already had that scare once, so it's not something I take lightly. And pomegranates are just a good idea all around. If I can get that great, juicy pomegranate flavor without having to deal with the hassle of getting in to an actual pomegranate, even better.<br /><br />The smell is wonderful. Nice and strong and juicy, I can already taste the delicious smoothies that will come from this. But I'm moving away from the smoothies more and more, as I used to think the only way I would enjoy matcha would be in a smoothie and I have since learned that that is decidedly not true. I'm on my third cup today!<br /><br />I don't know how to describe the taste other than juicy, which I feel like I've been using too much lately. But it's true! All of the fruit blends I've had from Red Leaf Tea have been juicy! This one especially...and I can just see a Matcha Pomtini in my future. Or mix this with a little orange juice? Yum. This tea is definitely one I want to spend a bit of quality time with.

The cake was actually delivered on Wednesday! It was extremely tasty and very fresh. I am very happy I ordered from this company.

review/text: This will double as an indelible dye (DO NOT spill it on anything you want to wear in company), but I am crazy over it.  Of course, after I mix up a batch, I add at least an ounce each of lemon juice & lime juice.  It takes that to bring out the most refreshing quality & counteract the sickening sweetness that most Americans other than me apparently crave.  I keep a jug of it in the refrigerator at all times, & it's rare a day will pass that I don't have a glass or 2 (or 3).  Stores around here stopped carrying it, as they do with anything that I really like (except for Safeway, which hit me up for $5.30 a cannister for it).  I was delighted to find it here, & I signed on for auto-delivery, because the price is so reasonable & I just GOTTA have it!

review/text: I have no idea why I like this drink so much. I usually stay away from espartame, but I make an exception for this one Crystal Light drink. Cherry Pomegranate... need I say more? It's low in calories and carbs and has the immunity on the go thing going for it with antioxidents. I liked the little tubs better, but these work fine. I make a big pitcher of it in the summer and we drink it daily. Regardless of whether we are getting antioxidized or not, we found a drink that we like.

review/summary: delicious
review/text: I think poppadums are the best part of any Indian meal.  While Amazon sells papad by Lijjat for a very reasonable price, that product, like most papad, needs to be fried or toasted.  This product allows for quick, immediate consumption with your favorite chutney (I really like Swad's chutney, particularly the mint).  The poppadums in the container are quite small -- about the size of a half dollar coin.  While small, each has a nice satisfying crunch.  Truly Indian makes several different poppadum flavors but the Lentil with Cumin is my favorite.<br /><br />As a product of India, you can expect to pay a premium.  I first bought a containers of these from my local Meijer and they were around 5 dollars.  So, with Amazon's subscribe and save, you are getting a fairly good deal.  I think fresh papad is always the best but if I want a fast snack that tastes great, I reach for these.

review/text: If you enjoy the mustard typically found in 'vats' :-) at Chinese restaurant buffets, this is for you. It is killer good and wicked hot. I mix one heaping teaspoon of the mustard powder, around 2 teaspoons of water, and 1 teaspoon of Kikkoman soy sauce in a small bowl. Mix together with spoon for a couple of minutes (may need to add additinal water/soy sauce to get desired consistency) until mustard is completely smooth (no lumps). Finally & very importantly, let it set up for 5-7 minutes. Then get ready for awesome mustard. Be careful though, it's way HOT in a horseradish kind of way. Enjoy.

review/summary: PF Changs Mustard
review/text: This is close third to PF Changs Mustard.  Colemans being a close second.  Follow the directions on the can, This is a dry mustard powder that needs to be mixed with a liquid. In a separate bowl I add water to the dry powder to bring it together.  Some people use red or rice vinegar in combination to water to cut the heat, or even soy sauce. Please note* a little goes a long way as this is Hot mustard. The heat is not like a chili pepper at all. It is reminiscent to a horseradish heat that comes on strong and instant, but also dissipates just as fast.  This does have a slight bitter after-taste when the heat dissapates. I have found mixing in a small amount of prepared Dijon makes this a smoother product, and less acrid.  It also is a bit grainy straight out of the can mixed/prepared. I only use one Tablespoon of dry mustard at a time with 1 Tablespoon of prepared.  I prefer buying COLEMANS Dry mustard, because it is not as acrid, has a better heat to it and is not as grainy.

review/summary: "The crazy kid eats the stuff..." and Mom is happy.
review/text: My older kids won't eat it if we paid them and it tastes kinda borderline to me.  But my 15 month old (who is picky) loves it.  I try to feed my kids food I prepare from my own kitchen, but this little guy wasn't getting enough iron.  The doc has put him on a high iron diet.  He always analyzes his food visually and won't let us pry open his mouth if it doesn't pass inspection.  But he willingly tasted this before he saw the green puree and was instantly sold!  I suspect he likes the cool delivery system. I'm checking with the manufacturer to see if it really is 120% DV for iron, or if it's a misprint.<br /><br />*** Update!  Yes, Ella's reports that it was a misprint and the company is working hard to fix the problem.  4% is the actual number.  That fits more with spinach's DV's.  Only way to get that high is to add iron supplements!  Glad I checked.  Got a quick and honest answer from them.  Hope they are able to fix labeling issues soon. It's still on our list of foods to boost iron levels.***<br /><br />I found some on sale in a local grocery store.  Amazon's price came pretty close, and is still cheaper than other online places I've found.  Including the manufacturer's website.<br /><br />Each kid has their own tastes, so don't write it off because it looks or tastes nasty to others.  Worth a try at least once (it might help to not look disgusted when you give it to your kids).  Seems to be a good product.  Now the frugal mom in me is trying to figure out if I can trick him by making my own puree and using a syringe to re-fill the bag so he'll eat!

review/summary: So far she likes it!
review/text: I can hardly contain my excitement so I had to post a review. My baby is almost 17 months old. When she first started solids at around 6 months, she was adventurous and tried and ate everything, including a great amount of veggies. When she turned a year old, she got really fussy and turned her little nose up at every single veggie we tried to give her. She would only eat fruit and yogurt with her cereal in the morning and for the rest of the day she would only accept meat. This has been going on for so long now that I began to get really really worried that she wasn't getting enough good nutrition. I had seen Ella's pouches, but hadn't tried them. A friend highly recommended them to us this weekend so I figured we should try it. I decided to go full on veggie and try this flavor (spinach, apple, rutabaga), and just give them away if she really hated it.<br /><br />Ok, so I'm only giving it 4 stars just in case things change, BUT i tasted one just now and thought, yuck, ok, this is REALLY strongly spinach flavored, she is NOT going to eat this, but I gave her the pouch and she gobbled it DOWN! She was still trying to get some out of the empty pouch! I can't believe it. I'm a very pleased mama. My fussy baby ate spinach, woohoo! :)<br /><br />I'll see how things go over the next few pouches, but so far I recommend them for fussy eaters. If she continues to like this one, I will try a few more. Thanks Ella's kitchen!

review/summary: DO THE MATH: $5.70 each!!! Can YOU afford this?
review/text: Be sure you understand they are asking you to give them about $40 for only **7** squeezies. That makes them nearly $6 each!!!! For fruit sauce??? There are SEVERAL other brands which offer the same thing--pureed fruits and vegetables in soft squeezy packages that can be sucked out by toddlers in carseats--and they are selling for around $35 for ***24***packages of squeezies. See that difference? The stuff tastes just as good, I've tried them. In fact, the broccoli one of Ella's is disgusting, in my opinion. I like the brand that starts with a "P", second word Organics. Not the bunny. These get one star for pricing. The star is given because the product is nice, but 4 stars are taken away because of the complete highway robbery of offering these in a pack of only 7 for $39.95. Don't encourage them.

review/summary: I am so disappointed with this company - buyer BEWARE indeed
review/text: After reading the reviews here stating that the Iron content of Ella's Kitchen Spinach packs was incorrect, I checked out their website to see for myself. Hmm.. no announcement there stating that an error had been made. So, I contacted the company wondering if it was a misunderstanding. No, it's true. The Spinach flavor only has 4-6% DV of Iron... NOT 120% as has been clearly indicated on the pouches I have been buying for my son for OVER A YEAR! I have been purchasing these packs by the case thinking that if my son did not eat enough other Fe-rich foods on a particular day, at least he would eat this. I mean you know how difficult it can be to get little ones to take in enough iron, so I thought this was a great option. IF I HAD KNOWN that it only contained 4 or 6%, then I would have given my son other additional Fe-rich foods or continued making my own purees. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true when I noticed that the first ingredient is in fact APPLES not Spinach as the front of the pouches would have you believe.<br /><br />What upsets me the most is that there is not even a warning or announcement on Amazon or at Target stores stating that there has been a mistake?!! If the company knows, why isn't this info passed on to the consumer?!!? Here I thought I was purchasing (a more expensive) but also more nutritionally complete product for my baby and to find out it's just as void of nutrients as all of the other brands on the shelves. I really thought this company was exciting and different and focused on kids' nutrition and health. I guess not. I am asking for a refund at the very least. Honestly, the company is lucky if parents don't decide to take up a lawsuit for their negligence in getting the word out. The incorrectly labeled packs should be recalled like anything else- not left on the shelves to trick parents! Normally, I am not one to overact and am certainly not litigious in the least. Humans (and companies run by humans) make mistakes. It's natural. But as a physcian and a mother, I am really annoyed by the lack of respect shown to consumers in failing to notify the community of this error.

review/text: This flavor does not actually contain 120% of daily iron for babies, as still listed on most packaging.  This was a grievous error (a "printing error" according to the company).  This flavor only contains 6% iron, in the realm of most other baby food pouch products.  Unfortunately, this company has failed to pull mislabeled products or notify distributors of the long running error.

review/summary: Tasty, a little bit runny
review/text: Great product.  For my older daughter, I made all organic baby food homemade.  Since we moved after the birth of my second child, we aren't able to get a nice fresh variety of organic fruits and veggies like we used to, so I decided to try buying organic baby food instead. My kids love these pouches (give or take a few of the flavors). I love the pouch packaging for easy clean-up, compact travel and not having to worry about carrying glass jars around.<br /><br />Both my infant (9 months old) and toddler (2.5 years old) love this flavor of Ella's the best, much to our surprise.  I think it's probably b/c it one of the few foods without bananas added.  It is a bit runny, so keep that in mind when using a spoon to feed.  But since it's so runny, it's good for younger ones that aren't used to thicker solids.<br /><br />The Spinach, Peas and Pears from Plum Organics is similar in taste, but is a little thicker, if the consistency of this one isn't right for you.  Also, we often mix this with some rice cereal to thicken it up if needed.<br /><br />I would recommend buying the variety pack to see which ones your kids might like.  Also, if they don't like it at first, don't give up, give them some time and try it again later.  They might change their minds.

review/text: Even I think that this baby food tastes good.  My 9 month old agrees.  I love that the ingredients are literally sweet potatoes, pumpkin, apples, and blueberries.  The only ingredient not in the title is lemon juice.  No crazy preservatives or other ingredients.  The problem is the company that is selling them on Amazon.  Don't take it out on Ella's.  You can find it MUCH more reasonably priced on diapers.com, or at Target.  I agree w/ another reviewer that the Plum organics baby food is also good, and a little cheaper, but this is still a staple in our son's diet.

review/text: This is a great product, my daughter will not eat her vegetables, but she will fly through this pouch in just a few seconds.<br />However, it does not make sense that the seller is selling these at $30 for just seven pouches.  We buy these at target for about $1.20 per pouch. Sure with sales tax here in Chicago that turns out to be about $1.30 per pouch, but still quite a bit less than the $4+ that this merchant is charging.<br /><br />In short, if you are thinking about getting this product, do so!  However, do not pay this price for it.

Plus you can't beat the antioxidant goodness found in these baby food pouches. My cat eats her food with more gusto if I mix it into her food, and tends to not eat as much as before. She misses her teaspoon of Ella's if I don't mix it into every meal.<br /><br />By the way, it is the best baby food I've ever eaten. I always sneak a teaspoon or three when I'm fixing up my cats food.

I'm always tasting his foods before I give it to him and this is something I would eat! My son was EBF until 6 months, and I started out making his own organic baby food, but working full time and being a single mom it was taking up too much time that I could be spending with my son. I researched the Ella's kitchen organic baby food and decided to try it out, and we haven't found a kind he dislikes! This has made feeding time a joy for both of us.

But after trying Happy Baby and Plum pouches I realized that this product stands alone.  The other organic baby food pouch manufacturers really thin it out with water. This is much more concentrated.  My daughter loves it and we're getting more nutrition in every pouch.  It's also a lot easier to control and prevent spills because a gentle squeeze doesn't send the food oozing out everywhere.  I love it and highly recommend it.

review/text: I found these wondering the isle of Target one day.  I'd decided to try baby food again because all of a sudden she stopped eating fruits and veggies.  Won't touch them if she recognizes them.  I don't know if a carrot or a pea chased her in one of her dreams, but it's been a nightmare trying to force her to eat them.  So for a time I just gave up and then she gained weight...oh no.  So went to find some baby apple sauce and stumbled upon these.  Best. Discovery. Ever.<br /><br />I take 2 with me when we're out, and give them to her when we're in the car or in between plays on the playground.  The best part of these is that I can 'inject' these into her when we're rushed. She's loved all of the flavors except for the Sweet Potatoes, and gets a kick out of eating them herself.<br /><br />After calculating what it would cost for me to make such concoctions (cheap but time consuming) and taking into consideration the method of delivery (the spouted pouch, which is about 50% of this product's wow factor) that I can not imitate, Amazon is the very best place to buy these yummy pouches.  Amazon's price makes my daughter consuming 2-3 of these a day affordable.

If money isn't an issue for you, I highly recommend this product.  If money is an issue and you want organic I recommend Earth's Best or Plum.  I've decided to just make my own.

review/summary: BUYER BEWARE! Read the nutrition label on Ella's website
review/text: This stuff is garbage and Ella's Kitchen should be ashamed for false advertising. I was really surprised to see a fruit product like this one had so much calcium (10%) on the package compared to most of the other baby fruits out there (usually 0-2% unless veggies or yogurt's added in) and chose this over other products, thinking the extra calcium would be worth the extra $ for my baby in the long run. When you check it against Ella's website, it HAS NO CALCIUM%! Same goes for all the other stage 1 Ella's fruits (butternut squash, carrots, apples, prunes: 30% calcium on package but 2% on the website, carrots, apples, parsnips 30% calcium on package vs. 0% on website all the same serving size) -- there were other differences too in protein, iron, etc. It does cost a lot more than some of the other organic baby fruits out there and tastes awful. If your baby is just as content with the other less expensive organic baby fruits out there, go with the cheaper alternative because nutrition wise, Ella's no better!<br /><br />What a disgusting marketing ploy by Ella's Kitchen to get parents to choose their products because it is falsely more nutritious when it's the same as other organic baby fruits in terms of nutritional value.

review/summary: Tastes good
review/text: I am very happy with this product. It tastes really yummy and doesn't have lots of "extra" ingredients. I love the variety in the Ella products and that my baby is getting lots of healthy foods in one meal. Also, it is very easy to just squeeze it onto a spoon to feed. No mess!

review/summary: Misleading nutrition information
review/text: I almost stopped giving my son iron drops thinking that this product was giving him much of his daily iron needs. The sweet potato/pumpkin flavor says it contains 45% of the daily iron needs but really it only has 2%. I don't understand how this company can just lie on the nutrition label.

review/summary: she loves it
review/text: My 14 month old loves this stuff.  i tasted it and it seems healthy and delicious enough.  My only reservation is about not being able to visually see and inspect what she's ingesting with these new tetra packs.

review/summary: Wonderful and Nutritious
review/text: My son had a little trouble on occasion with constipation and when he did, this would be our go to meal. The prunes always seemed to help, and he loves the taste.
