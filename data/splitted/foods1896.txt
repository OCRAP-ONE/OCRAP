review/summary: waxy yellow build up
review/text: I purchased these chews at the request of my mom, who had read about them.We were both sorely disappointed, in that they start out OK, but as you near the end of eating one, you are left with a waxy film on your mouth, tongue and lips, which needs to be scrubbed off with a toothbrush!  It is disgusting!  And I wrote repeatedly to the company, asking for a refund, and telling them of the problem, and have never heard back.<br />A terrible way to do business, but a good idea.  The other company's calcium chews do NOT have this problem!

review/text: I ordered and received the Benecol caramels.  They are quite expensive but if they do what they are supposed to do then they are worth the cost. I have eaten them now for about 2 weeks.  They are quite tasty-not sweet like candy but certainly good.  But it is too soon to review this product completely until I see evidence from my bloodwork to know if it does what it is supposed to do-that is lower overall cholesterol and raise the good cholesterol.  I will review it again when I have a bloodtest taken in another month.  Certainly, if they do what they are supposed to do, I'd much rather take them than some prescription medicine that has side effects.

review/summary: Benecol Chews
review/text: My cholesterol doctor and dietitian recommended that I chew one of these 2 - 3 times daily with meals. They actually taste like caramel.  I don't know if they work yet as I am not due to have a cholesterol lab until the end of January.  One word of caution, don't chew these and take a drink of cool water afterwards.  What is left of the chew in your mouth will stick to the roof of your mouth like glue.  I take these in the middle of a meal and that does the trick.

review/summary: Bring Back the Old Formula
review/text: Benecol Smart Chews disappeared from the market for a while, and returned in a "new-and-improved formula".  I'm so disappointed with the new formula.  I have no idea if it works any more, and I won't find out, because the taste is not good.  I used to enjoy them as a snack - nearly as good as a caramel.  Now they taste grainy, greasy, and artificial, and it's nearly impossible to get the metal wrapper off the chew.  In addition, they give me gas, unlike the old formula.  I won't be re-ordering.

review/text: I am seeing one of the 84 board certified lipidologists in the U.S. and he strongly recommends Benecol margarine, so when I saw these chews I knew I had to try them. I was having trouble eating 2 tbsp of the Benecol margarine a day, but it is easy to get the recommended amount with these chews. I will have my cholesterol checked again in a couple of weeks, so hopefully it helps along with medication. They really do taste like a caramel candy. I would recommend them highly!

I cut out nearly all dairy fat, added ~15 almonds/day and ~3g/day of psyllium, and started taking 1 Smart Chew 3 times/day.  My HDL remained the same, but my LDL dropped to 120, a 25% decrease!  I am a very happy camper!<br />My only complaint is that the product contains Yellow 6.  I've written to the company requesting that they remove it; if enough of us do that, maybe they'll comply.

review/text: After making hundreds if not thousands of purchases on amazon this is the first time I have left a review on a product.  This product had very good reviews so I bought it and I feel the good ratings were very misleading so I finaly decided to write a product review.<br />After eating a couple of these I thought they would be ok.  I have now taken about 20 of these and I can't stand them, they leave a greasy white substance on the roof of my mouth and don't taste that good either.  The packaging says that 5 of these chewables need to be taken a day to get the recommended 2 g of plant stanols/sterols.  I can hardly force myself to take one a day.  Do yourself a favor and find a pill form.

I am in club Benecol and haven't received anything. Spread the word, a safer way to lower your cholesterol. Word of mouth is about it, lets hope it works.<br /><br />Don't expect miracles with Benecol, but if you are borderline, this is a great supplement in addition to diet and exercise. Take at least 2 per day.  Expect ~10% lower total cholesterol in a month or two, some have reported more. Could be enough to keep you off the risky statins.  However, some report using Benecol and Statins, but I can't vouch for the results. It would be good to hear reports of that combo.

review/summary: Benecol Smart Chews
review/text: I started using Benecol Chews in June 2007.  I just recently had my cholesterol checked and I dropped significantly.  My last count was a total of 233 and the most recent count was a total of 190.  I was very thrilled.  I purposely wanted to get a new test before I ordered more Benecol Chews to make sure they were actually doing something for me.  I don't have to question the effects Benecol has had on me.  I attribute the drop in my total cholesterol to the Benecol Chews and adding more soluble fiber to my diet via oatmeal.  Look for oatmeal that contains at least 4 g of soluble fiber.  Most have just 1 or 2 soluble fibers.  Quaker Weight Control has 4 g of soluble fiber  and if you are familiar with Trader Joe's they have a Heart Healthy Oatmeal (Blueberry and Cranberry, Blueberry is my favorite) that also has 4 g of soluble fiber.  I also exercise regularly at least 4 time a week.  So I personally feel the combination of the above was the result of my drop in cholesterol.  I have highly recommended the Benecol Chews to family and friends.  Thank you.

review/text: This product is definitely not for diabetics, or anyone watching their weight (which most cardiac patients are supposed to do).  It is very high in calories (20 per chew, and they recommend two chews at a time), and it is also high in salt (Sodium 15 mg per chew, 30 per recommended serving).  Salt is somthing cardiac patients are supposed to restrict, or at the least, limit.<br />I also noted an undesirable thick waxy coating left on the roof of my mouth.  The coating is tasteless (not the candy itself).  One other side-effect I noticed is constipation.

review/summary: Benocol chews have been reformulated and they are disgusting!
review/text: I'm sure I won't be the only one that stops using this product after they changed the shape and more importantly the flavor of the chews. I just received my most recent shipment of the chews on November 4th, 2010 and I noticed the size of the individually wrapped chews was now rectangular. My first thought was no worries, it's all good new shape, same great product. But once popped that Carmel colored rectangle into my mouth I quickly realized that Benecol had changed the flavor of the chew from caramel, to something that tasted like a combination of butter, sugar and caramel flavoring and in a word, YUCK!<br /><br /> The old chews tasted exactly like a piece of caramel, they were actually pretty tasty and even though it helped lower my cholesterol, I actually enjoyed them as a treat. Now I'll have to find something else because I just can't bring myself to eat something that tastes as bad as these things.<br /><br /> It will be interesting to see how long it takes for Benecol to change the formula again, because I'm willing to bet that the popularity of the product plummets now that it no longer tastes good. Brain dead move Benecol, no doubt someone loses their job over this blunder!

The stunning news was my Cholesterol had dropped 43 points and 41 of those points was the LDL, which we call the "Low Down Lipids" because it's the bad stuff in your arteries. That huge drop was due to the Benecol Chews AND without medication.

review/summary: reformulation is terrible
review/text: I've been taking these for over a year, and possibly my chol. has been lowered a little, but who knows really?  I hate taking them, but the alternative is statins. (Another alternative is to ignore cholesterol levels, which may well have nothing to do with heart disease risk if there are no other risk factors, particularly in women.) The new product is greasy, even on the outside, and takes soap to wash off my hands.  It could be the glycerin, but why?  I called the company (there is a toll-free number on the box) to complain about the taste and consistency and ingredients!  They confirmed the reformulation.  They "noted" my comments and sent me a refund for one of the boxes.  It's unlikely anything will change because they just reformulated. The sugar content is the same, but they taste even sweeter than before.  They are granular now, where before they were smooth.  The shape is different but who cares (except they were interested in what I thought about that!).  Mostly why do they have to put all that corn syrup and sugar in (I told them adults were taking this, not children), and why any dye (yellow #5). I urge you to call and complain, they said all the calls had to do with help in finding the product.  When I asked why it was only available online the answer was it's always been that way.

Benecol also makes the butter spread, but it is very expensive for one small tub of butter. I recommend the chews because you can have them anytime especially if you have a craving for something sweet. It's like chewing a caramel candy, but remember it is not a candy so do not take/treat the product like one or leave them out in the open especially if you have young kids. Take the chews/dosage as it is recommended by the manufacturer.

review/text: Benecol is easy to take and inexpensive, but it does not comply directly with Prevention magazine's scientific research.  The package suggests taking up to 4 "chews" per day, while Prevention says that amount of plant sterol may actually cause more cholesterol in the body.  Prevention says that 2 grams per day is the ideal amount that should be taken.  Also each chew has .85 grams, so taking 2 chews does not give you the ideal amount.  It would be better to have each chew be 1 gram of plant sterol.

I AM A LONG WAY FROM IDEAL CHOLESTEROL LEVELS, BUT WITH A CHANGE IN MY DIET, THIS WAS A GOOD START WITHOUT MEDICATION SO NORMALLY PRESCRIBED. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE WITH HIGH LDL.

No change in activity level or diet and currently on perscription medication for cholesterol.  Cholesterol was within normal levels after the benecol chews and it didn't change much or quickly with medication.  We will keep buying these for sure!

review/text: I have been taking Benecol for 3 mos now.  Three mos ago, my Dr wanted me to start a statin, instead I ordered Benecol and ate healthier.  Fruits, veggies, lean protein.  Cut way back on red meat and lowered carb intake.  New lab work done 2 weeks ago and my results were better.  I believe the Benecol is helping along with the changes I made.  I do not want to take a statin until it is absolutely necessary.  I will continue with Benecol and a healthy diet with added exercise.

review/summary: Wrong for some people.
review/text: This may be the last thing you need if your triglycerides and blood pressure are high and you've read some of the books (starting with Gerald Reaven) about Syndrome X, Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, or metabolic syndrome.  In fact, high blood sugar counts and the aforementioned considerations may be as indicative of a tendency toward heart disease as LDL and HDL levels.<br /><br />The main ingredients in Benecol chews are corn syrup and sugar.  True, they taste as good as chewy candy caramels, but the minimum daily quota requires you to imbibe 80 grams of simple carbohydrate calories.  True, 80 "empty" calories isn't a great deal, but if you've read a popular book by someone of the other, "cholesterol camp"--Caldwell Esselstyne, fpr instance--you know that he believes the least bit of fish oil, or any sort of oil, can be damaging.<br /><br />Later: I've come to the conclusion that many of the popular heart books, Esselstyne's along with the "China Study" included, say far too little (some totally ignoring the subject) about the role of sugar, insulin overproduction and insulin resistance, and the implications of all this to triglycerides and high blood pressure.  I doubt that Dean Ornish would endorse this product.  Since I've decided that corn syrup, simple sugar, etc. DOES matter--at least for some folks--I'm reducing my rating by a star, even at the rate of appearing a bit of a sourpuss.  Besides your cholesterol levels, check your blood sugar count and triglyceride levels, both of which contribute to metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, syndrome X, and heart disease.

review/text: My cholesterol had been high -- 265 - for some time.  I did NOT want to take statins, so I tried many methods said to lower cholesterol, like eating oatmeal everyday, cutting out red meat, and exercising.  That dropped my cholesterol to 257.  However, after using Benecol -- taking one or two chews with a meal twice a day -- for five months, my cholesterol is now 219!  I am thrilled.  I have referred several other friends to this wonderful product.  Some people like to eat a "chocolate mint" after meals, I eat a Benecol chew !  Thank you for carrying this product.

review/text: Plant stanols (similar to plant sterols) actually have a good deal of research behind them, and are recommended by many respected health organizations. Benecol caramels are nice, soft, buttery-tasting caramels with plant sterols, no trans fat, and 20 calories each. To ingest the optimal amount of plant stanols per the research that I read, you need about 5 a day. I use Benecol Light spread instead of butter, though, so I eat around 3 a day. It's a great excuse to have a little candy every day!

Then they went out of stock for several months & I tried another product that I didn't like as well.  I was so happy when these came back, since they tasted much better.  They really taste like caramel chews.  HOWEVER, they do leave a little film on the inside of your mouth afterwards.  The film is not too bad; I think of them as little desserts.  I just got back my cholesterol test results and my LDL (bad cholesterol) went down 27 points (from 164 to 137)!  I'm really pleased.

review/summary: Lowered cholesterol for me better than diet & exercise!
review/text: I have had high cholesterol since my 20's but the ratios were good so my doctor didn't recommend medication until age 45.  Since I didn't want to take medication, I went on a strict low cholesterol diet and exercised 5 days a week for 45 - 60 minutes a day and lost 16 pounds and am at my goal weight and my cholesterol gradually went down (10-12 points every 3 months#. After a year of stict low cholesterol diet and exercise, my doctor said I would not have to take the medication. My total cholesterol was 199. Diet alone would does not work for my cholesterol levels. As soon as I stopped exercising as much, the cholesterol levels went back up.  Then I decided to try Benecol and am I glad I did.  My total cholesterol went down to 176 in 3 months and the bad cholesterol was lower than ever and the good was even higher and all this without any exercise and after adding in back all the foods I had done without for years!  I take 2 chews before lunch and 2 chews before dinner every day and that works best for me.  When I tried to take 1 chew before lunch and 1 before dinner, my total cholesterol went back up quite a bit #in only 3 months) so I switched back to 2 chews before each meal where I'm eating food with cholesterol. I highly recommend this product and can't wait to go back to the doctor again to see if it has gone even lower!

review/summary: New Formulation - Some important changes
review/text: Some others have pointed out that the new formulation changed the shape, size taste and consistency of the chews.  But there are some more important changes you need to know about.<br /><br />  First of all, each piece contains less plant sterol esters (0.70 down from 0.85), but more sugars (4g up from 3g).  They have also added 50mg of calcium.<br /><br />  One study has shown that calcium in conjunction with plant sterols has beneficial effects on HDL and LDL. (Effects of calcium and plant sterols on serum lipids in obese Zucker rats on a low-fat diet - Timo Vaskonena, Eero Mervaalaa, Ville Sumuvuoria, Tuulikki Sepp&auml;nen-Laaksoa and Heikki Karppanena - British Journal of Nutrition 2002)<br /><br /> However, other studies indicate that calcium might be associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer, possibly due to supressing Vitamin D levels.  All of this is still somewhat controversial, so I suggest you do your research before using this product.

review/summary: BEWARE! 12g sugar and 80 calories a day to get your stanols!
review/text: I bought these because it seemed a compelling way to get plant stanols, which medical literature praise for their cholesterol reducing abilities.  I don't consume a lot of bread, so the benecol/stanol butter substitute spreads were not a reliable source of stanols for me.<br /><br />However, these chews aren't all they are cracked up to be.  If you have 4 chews per day (like they suggest), you get 16 grams of carbs, 12 grams of sugar, and 80 calories!  For anyone who has high cholesterol + high triglycerides, that isn't a desirable way to get your stanols.  Even if these lower your cholesterol, the offsetting risk to your triglycerides might negate the heart healthy benefits.  I'm no expert on this, but I find that eating too many sugars only makes me hungrier.<br /><br />If you like to have spreads on your breads and are using stanols as part of your heart health regimen, I'd suggest a tub of Benecol or Smart Balance instead!<br /><br />Benecol - can you bring me stanols in a capsule without the sugar?

Also has greatly lowered my triglycerides.  So I plan to continue the Benecol. My doctor has highly recommended the Benecol.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: I would recommend Benecol Smart Chews. My cholesterol was at 240 when my doctor told me to watch my diet and exercise and get my cholesterol retested in 6 months.  Since I already did watch my diet to some extent, and I am not overweight or have other heath issues, I decided to try Benecol Smart Chews. My cholesterol went from 240 to 214.  I also limited high cholesterol foods as much as possible, but I credit some of the reduction in cholesterol to Benecol.  I will continue to take them.  They taste very good, like caramel and do not upset my stomach, even when taken on an empty stomach.

review/summary: Great Buy
review/text: I began purchasing the Benecol Smart Chews for my father who was directed by his doctor to reduce the level of his 'bad' cholesterol. We started off with just a diet change for Dad, which had limited success, but not with the overall speed and effectiveness we were looking for. After some research, I found the chews and ordered a 3 month supply for him from Amazon. Over that period, we were able to achieve the level that the doctor asked for and Dad found his 'medicine' tasty and easy to tolerate. Great buy, great price, and very convenient as I can order it and have it shipped directly to him.

review/summary: Bound Up
review/text: Love the caramel flavor and texture. Had high hopes for this product as my cholesterol is extremely high and I cannot tolerate the statins in normal medications. Used the butter for about three weeks before the chews. Extremely expensive but does it work? After about a week on the chews I noticed that my stomach was not feeling normal. A couple more days and constipation set in. I stopped taking the benecol and started stool softeners and laxatives. After about two weeks my system somewhat returned to normal. Side effects include but are not limited to constipation.

review/summary: Benecol Benefits Believer
review/text: This product was recommended by my cardiologist to reduce my pretty-high cholesterol. I was, as always, skeptical of "naturo-pathic" type remedies. After one (1) month of daily use as recommended my total cholesterol decreased 78%. I am not on statins or those types of meds so this was almost a stand-alone effect as I barely adjusted my diet or exercise-level. It didn't seem to negatively effect my other blood test results during this period. I am still in shock but plan to keep chewing. Imagine what will happen if I get off my butt & exercise and eat more veggies!! I am not a fan of the caramel/butterscotch like flavor but that's just my taste preference issue--like strawberry or pistachio ice-cream. To me, the results are well worth the temporary endurance of caramel taste that food or water quickly washes away. Again, wow!

review/text: I watch Dr. Oz, and he recommended to get cholesterol down, to use Benecol. I now use the "butter" which is GREAT, and decided to get the chews also. They certainly do NOT taste like caramel, more like butterscotch. A bit grainy, but doable. I will continue with the spread, as the chews are too expensive. They also say you need to eat 5 to get the benefit of a lower cholesterol.

review/summary: Yes, it works
review/text: The price at Amazon keeps bouncing up and down (tending up), but having a box shipped automatically with the ability to adjust shipment timing as needed, works great.  As for the Benecol itself, the butter version isn't cheap and is hard to find, so we prefer these "caramel"-like chews.  We also use Smart Balance's Heart Smart butter spread, which uses stanols/sterols, but stores locally have discontinued it, so it has to be special-ordered at exhorbitant prices, and in a hard-to-store 6-pack.<br /><br />The wife's Drs. have had her all over the map with prescription cholesterol drugs for 20+ years, but only since she consistently uses the Benecol chews, Heart Smart spread, and RX Zetia, has her numbers become acceptable.  In the past she's used Benecol in a pill form, but I think they quit making it, and it wasn't cheap.  Neither are the chews, but Amazon's price, though variable, the ease of storage and use and tastiness, and the lab test results all make this a highly viable solution to the cholesterol problem.<br /><br />Over the years, whenever she's used some version of Benecol, her cholesterol numbers dipped.  Having Amazon automatically ship a box every 2-3 months means she for once is consistently using the stuff, and her latest lab tests bare the great results - down to 199 from over 300.  And she's been off the Crestor/Lipitor prescription scheme (except Zetia) for 6 months because they make her muscles ache.  As I understand it, Zetia works in the gut like Benecol and Heart Smart, not in the liver like Crestor, etc., so it has had no side effect we've noticed;  but I'm not sure she even needs the Zetia except to placate the Drs.<br /><br />It won't restrict your body from manufacturing its own cholesterol like Lipitor or Crestor work, but it definitely will affect your lab results by taking food-sourced cholesterol out of the picture so you won't absorb it out of your intestine.  The wife prefers the Benecol because it works and is like eating a piece of candy, rather than taking another pill.  I let her have her indulgence, and for my own cholesterol control I watch my diet, use Heart Smart spread instead of butter, and rather inconsistently use Cholest-Off caplets;  but my cholesterol count has always been on the high side of normal without pills anyway.

Secondly, I would like to see that you are allowed to order an item say every 4 months because if you take 2 tabs a day for 30 days it lasts for two months only and you do not have a slot for 4 month period only shows 2 months and 6 months.

review/summary: The pros and cons of Benecol Smart Chews
review/text: I would prefer to lower my cholesterol by not eating a candy-like substance with the calories it includes. I deal with this by eating<br />these Smart Chews at a time in the day when I start to feel hungry. This replaces some other snack that I may eat which keeps my<br />calories down. The Smart Chews do have somewhat of a waxy taste but since I love caramels I can somewhat enjoy them and hope they are<br />helping my cholesterol (which I will be getting checked soon). I will continue to use them along with the spread. They both are<br />rather pricey.

review/summary: Salty...
review/text: I consume only wild fish including salmon, herring, sardines and more. I have tasted different smoked fish and usually a smoked fish is suppose to have a smell that will make you hungry. This fish does not have a strong smoked smell or taste. It is very dry and salty fish. I have consumed smoked herrings which are very dry as well as smoked white fish which is a tradition during Easter and this taste more like that than the smoked fish I get from Germany which I savor every single drop of the oil and the fish in the container. I assume this is their procedure of producing smoked salmon and regardless of the price which happens to be expensive, I certainly would not consider consuming this product again regardless of the price... Dry and salty.

I was not disappointed in the cereal at all.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of sugary cereal so this cereal hit the right spot with it's subtle sweet taste with a hint of cinnamon.

After soften the cereal, the texture of the cereal reminded me of Chex Rice cereal but denser and heartier.<br /><br />My teen likes this cereal enough to eat again but thinks it's not very sweet and felt some squares tasted sweeter than others.  I didn't have the same experience and that may be because I let my cereal soak for a few minutes.<br /><br />I'm planning on substituting this cereal for the Chex cereal I use in a snack that consists of mixing the cereal with melted chocolate and peanut butter.<br /><br />A 14.5 ounce box of Cinnamon Quaker Oatmeal Squares contains 7 - 1 cup servings.<br />Total fat: 2.5g (Saturated 0.5g, Polyunsaturated 1g, Monounsaturated 1g)<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 190mg<br />Potassium 200mg<br />Total Carbohydrate: 44g (Dietary fiber 5g, Soluble Fiber 2g, Sugars 9g, Other Carbs 30g)<br />Protein: 6g

review/summary: Tasty Contraband Sugar Cereal
review/text: I like this cereal for its taste and sturdy crunch, but as with all cereals, it's imperative to read the side of the box to know what you're eating. Oatmeal, yes. But what makes it taste so good is nine grams of sugar. That's the same amount of sugar per serving as:<br /><br />1. Honey Nut Cheerios<br />2. Rice Krispie Treats cereal<br /><br />...and only two more grams than these classic sugar bombs:<br /><br />1. Frosted Flakes<br />2. Lucky Charms<br /><br />Keep in mind, too, that a "serving" is a measly cup. Make it a cup and a half and you're up to 13.5 grams of sugar. Yikes.<br /><br />For this reason, Quaker Oatmeal Squares is outlawed in our home. It's also incredibly expensive, when you compare it to a canister of real oats: 15 cents for a bowl of Quaker Oats, vs. $1.00 for a bowl of QOS, which lists sugar as five of its top seven ingredients (see list below). Not recommended.<br /><br />Whole Oat Flour<br />Whole Wheat Flour<br />Brown Sugar<br />Sugar<br />Maltodextrin<br />Malted Barley Extract<br />Molasses

review/summary: Unsatisfying. Cinnamon is supposed to be an accent, not the predominant taste
review/text: The box says "crunchy oat cereal with just a hint of CINNAMON", but I would classify it has having a moderate cinnamon taste, which is a reasonable level for this type of product. I would have been disappointed if there was less. The problem is that here cinnamon is the predominant taste -- the underlying squares are quite bland.  In most recipes, cinnamon functions as an accent, and for good reason. Without a base flavor, the impact of the cinnamon is fleeting and unsatisfying.<br /><br />Although the box claims that the cinnamon is "baked into" the squares, a very noticeable amount winds up in the milk and on the side of the bowl (as specks), which is more what I would expect from it being a coating.<br /><br />The squares are definitely crunchy and stand up well to sitting in milk.<br /><br />3-stars = "It's OK" : I wouldn't buy it for myself, but I wouldn't refuse it if someone else served it to me.

review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares are smaller in size than one would expect, especially in comparison with some other cereals. The dietary information is encouraging as there is fairly low sodium, 190 mg per 1 cup serving and 5 grams of dietary fiber along with 6 grams of protein.<br /><br />One of the things I first noticed about the cereal was its ability to remain crisp long after some other cereals had given way to sogginess. This is a real plus for my money. The box was 14.5 ounces as advertised and comes in one of those pouches that must be cut with a pair of scissors to open. All told it is a nice alternative to the spoon size shredded wheat and the raisin bran cereal that more frequently winds up on the breakfast menu. Try it, there's a good chance you'll like it.

review/text: Yes, I got my box for free. I probably wouldn't have bought it. There are too many cereals I like to bother with one I might or might not like, right?<br /><br />My concerns were two-fold. First, would they be sweet enough. I don't need sugar-coated cereal, but I don't want to eat cardboard, either. And second, tight-woven cereals like this tend to suck-up all the milk, so they'll start off too dry, but end up too soggy. Could this cereal overcome those concerns?<br /><br />In a word, yes.<br /><br />The flavor was sweet, with a hint of cinnamon. The squares started-off crunchy, but not too rough, and they did not suck-up the milk like a sponge, so they weren't too soggy at the end, either.<br /><br />I still have other cereals that I like better, but I'll likely occasionally buy this one, too.

review/text: I recently had the pleasure of trying the Cinnamon flavored Outmeal Squares.  This is a tasy cereal out-of-the-box, and many people will just need to add milk to enjoy.  I am a sugar-holic, plus I love Cinnamon, so for me the product could have used a bit more sweet and cinnamon flavor.  But that is easily sprinkled on if desired.  Overall this is a decent cereal - give it shot!

review/summary: Crunchy cinnamon treat
review/text: These little Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares are indeed delicious as a snack right out of the box or as a breakfast cereal with milk. In fact, there was almost none left to test with milk since they were eaten out of hand once the box was opened.<br /><br />They are pleasantly sweet without being too sweet and the cinnamon taste is almost understated so I found myself adding some. (I like cinnamon)<br /><br />The squares are a little smaller in size than I anticipated and as has been stated they hold up well and remain crunchy even after milk has been added.

review/summary: Tasty and crunchy
review/text: This is a nice tasty little cereal.  It's good with milk but also makes a tasty snack by itself.  I had some of these in a baggie at an internal work meeting late in the afternoon.  When I crunched down on one, everybody laughed!  They have a light taste, and only slightly sweet.<br /><br />At 210 calories per 8 oz cup without milk, the box lists a nice selection of vitamins, including A, C, E, Folic Acid, calcium, iron, thiamin, riboflavin, Niacin, B6, phosphorus, magnesium, and zinc. 200 mg potassium, 0 mg cholesterol, 190 mg sodium, and 44g carbs of which 9g is sugar.  Cins grains and wheat.

review/summary: sweet and cinnamony but too heavy.
review/text: Oatmeal squares (also made with a lot of wheat flour and sugar) are tasty and hold their rather substantial crunch. They also have a nice cinnamon oatmeal flavor with a strong sweet note. So that sounds great, right? Well, they hold their crunch so well that my jaw was tired after chewing through a bowl of them. After a while I felt like I was eating Legos. These hearty pieces are a bit too dense for my taste, so this cereal will not be on my list of favorites.

review/summary: Not bad but is it necessary?
review/text: This cereal tastes good with or without milk, holds up well (keeps its crunch) with milk. The cinnamon flavor is not overpowering and it isn't too sweet. This cereal is pretty much like shredded wheat but made with oats. What the differences are nutritionally between shredded what and this cereal is, perhaps would make a difference as to which you would prefer.<br /><br />It is good, but is it really anything new? 4 starts for taste and crunch.

review/summary: Cruncy, tasty, hearty and healthful
review/text: The Quaker Oatmeal Squares Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal makes for a very tasty and satisfying breakfast. Taste is overall very good as is the ability to remain crunchy while drenched in milk. In other words, it doesn't turn soggy that easily which is a very good thing. By the same token, it's not as hard as some granolas so it's easy to eat and digest. I tried this with soy milk -- but I assume the taste experience would be similar with regular milk. I would not hesitate to buy this in the future.<br /><br />There are 210 calories, 46 grams of whole grains and 5 grams of fiber per serving (without the milk/soy milk). So it appears to be a relatively healthy breakfast as well.<br /><br />I also tried the "Hint of Brown Sugar" version at the same time and I prefer this Cinnamon flavor more. I noticed that the "Brown Sugar" version actually is rated a little higher on Amazon, but to me it tasted a little too much like maple syrup which I don't like in cold cereal. So that's why I like this Cinnamon flavor better, which I find just perfect in terms of the amount added.

review/summary: Tasty and crunchy, and not too sweet
review/text: Most breakfast cereals these days are cloyingly sweet.  It is not really just breakfast cereals that suffer from this, for example, try to find unsweetened ice tea in the beverage aisle, it can be difficult.<br /><br />I even find that most artificially sweetened foods, for example, oatmeal, tend to be so overly sweetened; when all I really want is something that just simply has less sugar.<br /><br />So I was pleasantly surprised to find that these tasty toasty little squares are only lightly sweetened. How refreshing to find something that isn't sickeningly over-sweetened, and that tastes good to boot. The whole family enjoy them, even my youngest who loves to eat sweet treats, he doesn't really miss it.  In fact, it's time to get some more because we have run out.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: I'm a huge fan of cinnamon, so these oatmeal squares seemed like a good idea.  Overall, they're not bad.  Yes, there is a cinnamon flavor, albeit, somewhat weak.  If you've had the regular Quaker Squares and liked them, you'll like these.  Overall, they tasted okay, but not very memorable.  Good enough to where I'll finish the box.

review/summary: A Great Way for Start Your Day
review/text: This cereal is absolutely delicious. The cereal is very crispy. It is flavored very quite light so that we do not have to eat it with milk. Additionally, this cereal is made of real grain which is very healthy for our health. Even though it is not very sweet, it still gives us enough energy to work and study. This product is very suitable for breakfast, and it will be a great way to start our day.

review/summary: Lots of crunch with a hint of flavor
review/text: When perusing the cereal aisle, there are a LOT of choices these days. Some are clearly NOT good for you, some are, and some are just OK. You aren't going to be on a 3-hour sugar buzz, but neither are you really doing yourself that huge of a favor. Perhaps you are one of those who thought Raisin Bran was good for you... until you found out it has more sugar than Fruit Loops!<br /><br />Enter Quaker Oatmeal Squares, in this case infused with "a hint" of cinnamon. My first two thoughts are 1) must be good for you if it's from Quaker Oats! and 2) mmm... cinnamon!<br /><br />Bottom line: IF you sweeten it a bit, this cereal is good and crunchy at first. It does NOT have an overwhelming cinnamon flavor, and in some ways is a bit bland. But the flavor is acceptable. The crunch will wear off quickly, though, if you let it soak for more than a couple of minutes.<br /><br />The pitch is that "each square has cinnamon baked into it". Well, honestly, does it matter if it's baked in or sprinkled on? I think it could use a bit more flavor, but that's mostly just my opinion. Others may find it just right. The cereal consists of 46 grams of whole grains per serving, so that part is good. If you are going to consume cereal, you should consume those made with whole grains. It also packs a decent amount of soluble fiber (5g) and protein (6g - high for a dry cereal). There are 210 calories in a 1 cup serving of Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cereal (Cinnamon). The caloric breakdown is: 10% fat, 79% carbs, 11% protein. The cereal has 9g of sugar per serving.<br /><br />So if you're a cereal eater and looking for something healthier than Cap'n Crunch, this is probably a "better" selection. That said, I caution anyone against starting their day with a ton of carbohydrates, especially those derived from sugary sources. And as with anything, be aware of what a "serving" is and practice moderation. If not measured out, many folks would potentially consume 2-3 servings (in this case cups) in a single bowl, which would equate to a quick 400-600 calories just for breakfast!

review/summary: Tasty and Healthy
review/text: I'm usually a cereal man when it comes to breakfast. That is, unless of course, there's donuts or pancakes. But most of the time I try to stick with a healthy type of cereal rather than Lucky Charms or something of that nature. My two favorites are usually raisin bran or frosted mini wheats but this has worked its way into my regular rotation. They are nice and cruncy with just enough cinnamon and sweetness to be tasty without overpowering your taste buds. Also, it's nice and hearty so it doesn't leave me hungry after only 30 minutes. Definitely recommended.

review/summary: a little plain
review/text: They weren't joking when they said "just a hint of cinnamon;" I could barely discern any cinnamon at all.  This cereal wasn't bad, but it didn't have much flavor of any kind.  For such a plain cereal, Oatmeal Squares seemed a little high in calories especially considering the serving size is on the small side.  For comparison, I looked at another fairly plain cereal, Kix.  Kix has 110 calories with a serving size of 1 1/4 cups;  Oatmeal Squares has 210 calories with a serving size of 1 cup.  On the plus side, Oatmeal Squares held up really well in a bowl full of milk.

review/summary: Good cereal
review/text: I thought this was a good-tasting, filling cereal.  I am not a fan of very sweet-tasting cereals, so I liked the fact that it was just a touch of cinnamon. I also thought the cereal was pretty filling and generally kept me full until lunch.  The only thing I would change is to make the pieces smaller, as I'm used to Cheerio-sized pieces and these were much larger.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a plain, very slightly sweet breakfast that will keep them going throughout the morning.

review/summary: The Box says "OATMEAL SQUARES" which I believe is FALSE advertising.
review/text: "Oatmeal Squares" is in about the largest print you can fit on the Front of the Box.  When you read the ingredients, the second largest ingredient is WHEAT flour. So how can it rightfully be called a "Crunchy Oat Cereal".<br /><br />I wonder why Quaker, which is noted for Oatmeal has to be somewhat deceptive and not disclose upfront that this is not completely an Oat Cereal and then go on to make claims about Cholesterol Lowering when it is not ALL Oat Flour.<br /><br />Oatmeal is made from oats not wheat.  This is really "Oatmeal and Wheat Squares"<br /><br />Who cares how it tastes if it is not what it says it is.

review/text: A nice crunchy taste to start off your morning. It is also very good dry as a quick snack grabbing a handful and eating as i blog. My wife came home the evening that I received this in the mail and she had a dish of ice cream she could not finish and handed it to me, so i dropped a few squares into the chocolate ice cream for a very nice hot evening treat.

review/summary: I like them but I don't love them
review/text: I like to eat cereal as a snack, straight out of the box and Quaker Oatmeal Squares are great for that. When I ate them in a bowl with milk, I didn't like them as much. They don't seem to get any softer with milk, unless maybe you let them soak for a while. I like cereal that doesn't get soggy but I want it to soak up at least a little bit of the milk. I also thought that they were sweet enough when I ate them straight out of the box but with milk, I thought they needed to be sweeter so I added sugar.

review/summary: One of the Sturdy Ones
review/text: Seems to me there was a different version of this cereal around some years ago that rather resembled Life. Be that as it may, this cereal in no way resembles Life and requires a bit of a commitment. It's very hearty, holds up superbly in milk, and is only kind of sweet. In short, a bowlful can't be scarfed down like frosted flakes or fruit rings; it demands your attention for the duration. This is good, because one should pay attention to what one eats. It would be nice if there was a little more flavor to devote one's attention to though. There is some, both of oats and cinnamon, but they're rather overwhelmed by the sheer bulk of the pieces. All in all, I'd give them average marks on their own and recommend them as a mixer with other cereals that have a lighter and perhaps sweeter character.

review/summary: Better taste than I expected
review/text: I eat oatmeal just about every day, but it's not exactly the tastiest stuff in the world, so I was prepared for cardboard-tasting cereal bites in this box. In fact, Quaker Oatmeal Squares taste pretty good. The touch of cinnamon is just about right, and the little squares have also hit the right crunchiness quotient. This is a good breakfast cereal that might even make a good snack.

review/summary: Tastes good, but loaded with sugar
review/text: The cereal squares were tasty, and stayed crunchy in milk. They had good texture. I took 2 stars off because the name gave me the impression that it was a healthy breakfast choice. I'm in the market for heathier choices, with less sugar due to the fact I'm a Type 2 diabetic. One bowl drove my blood sugar to almost 200!  Please read the ingredient label before you buy!
