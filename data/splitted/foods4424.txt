review/summary: WOW
review/text: If  you are looking for a really bold cup of coffee then you must try these K-Cups.  It actually foams after brewing just like a great cup of espresso.  My husband was looking for a great morning cup and this is it! I stick to my Donut Shop K-cup but if you are in the market for a really true, rich, strong cup then go for it.

review/text: This is a VERY strong roast and a great morning coffee if you need your eyeballs popped open in a hurry!  I would strongly suggest using the largest cup size when brewing this kcup.  I used quite a bit of sweetener and threw in some cocoa powder which really enhanced the flavor and actually made the coffee much smoother.  Next time, I will use even more milk to further dilute the flavor.  This coffee would be a great base for cappucino, frappucino, etc etc.  I picked this up at Bed/Bath/Beyond for $11.99 with 20% off coupon.  It's also available at Target and Safeway.

review/summary: Just too expensive.
review/text: The Starbuck's French Roast is a good, bold coffee. But, at almost double the price of other comparable brands (Green Mountain Double Black Diamond for one) I just can't justify  the unrealistically high cost.  I'll stick to the Double Black Diamond.  In my opinion it is equally as bold with just a little more flavor.  Since taste is so subjective, you will have to decide for yourself.

review/summary: Starbucks comes to Keurig at last!
review/text: Partisans of Starbucks coffee have been waiting a long time for it to be released in the K-cup delivery system.  Coffee drinkers who like the Starbucks approach to dark roasting will not be disappointed.  The brew is strong but not bitter, slightly smokey but not excessively so, and with a pleasant flavor palette that, to me, seems dominated by chocolate.<br /><br />I've been a coffee fanatic all my life.  Many coffee fanatics take delight in denouncing Starbucks for a variety of reasons, some valid, some mere pretense.  I'm the first to say that Starbucks is not the best coffee in the world and that the Keurig brewing system does not produce the finest cup.  However--and this is a significant however--when one considers the time saved, the hassle avoided, and the waste eliminated, I find this a very satisfactory way to produce a fresh cup when I don't have time to fire up my grinder and brew the in the conventional way.<br /><br />I won't give up my freshly roasted beans, my dripper pot, or my grinder but I will certainly drink--and enjoy--Starbucks K-cups when the time is just not right for a meticulously hand-crafted pot.

review/text: This produces a nice strong cup of coffee. I prefer strong coffee..most K-cups usually result in weaker brews. The usual problem with Starbucks is they are pretty expensive. But this deal for around 50c a cup is a very good deal, usually starbucks brand k-cups sell for about 1$ a cup.<br /><br />Update: on the ones sold by warehouse deals: the best before on those is aug 2012, so all those hoarders start drinking!

review/summary: Great K-Cup Coffee
review/text: First off, for those of you crying about the price of this coffee......... you probably shouldn't have this coffee maker in the first place. This is the best k-cup I have tried yet. You can use the "larger cup" button on these k-cups and get a great tasting, aromatic, strong cup of coffee. I can even see a little bit of foam around the rim of my cup when the brewing is complete. If you do not like strong coffee (as the French Roast always is) then don't buy this coffee. I will be trying the Pikes Place k-cup next.<br /><br />P.S.  As for the Dunkin' Donuts K-cups, do not waste your time. They are the same price as Starbucks, and you can only get them at the stores. I had my wife send me some of the original blend and it tastes nothing like their coffee.

review/text: I have tried all the Coffee People flavors (Jet Fuel, Tiger, Wake up Call,) as well as most of the Green Mountain flavors. I have found that the Sumatra by SB is the best tasting one of them all. It makes me happy to get out of bed and have my Sumatra coffee. When you brew this coffee, it has a "head" on it when it comes out of the Keurig spout, it is just like the smell at the SB store, and also has that very fresh taste. I have found that most of the KCups are either crazy weak, or just too acidic for my taste...I swear, thank goodness SB finally got in the KCup game. No, I do not work for SB.

review/text: This Starbucks French Roast K-Cup is indeed a very delicious and bold coffee that tastes every bit as good as the in-store brew. We typically drink the much more affordable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Donut Shop K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, but occasionally like to try other types. There is no doubt that this Starbucks coffee is better tasting but it is a too expensive when drinking 4-5 cups a day.<br /><br />Recommended for the flavor (5 stars) but not at the retail price (3 stars).<br /><br />CFH

review/text: Simply the best K-cup I've sampled so far (and I've sampled many).  If you like bold, rich coffee than you should definitely try this one. When it comes right down to it, it's still cheaper than buying a cup of coffee outside of the home (even at a donut store) so I don't see the price as that exorbitant. Sometimes quality comes at a price.

review/summary: Just so gross....
review/text: This coffee tastes like chocolate that's gone bad.  It's overpriced and just not very good.  Starbucks has always over-roasted their beans.  I guess if you like that then you might like this coffee.  To my tastebuds however, it was just bitter and gross with a weird off-taste that left me making faces long after the cup was gone.<br /><br />Also, to all the reviewers who are saying that this was finally a strong k-cup, I say bah.  There are many other brands that make a cup just as strong but much better tasting.  This was just swill.  Bitter gross swill.<br /><br />If Coffee People still made their french roast I wouldn't have even bothered putting this in the brewer.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IOKA70">San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count</a> is my current favorite for my Keurig.  It's so much cheaper than a Starbucks k-cup.  But even if it weren't, it's still a better cup of coffee.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.  Overpriced and over-roasted equals bad coffee.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: These beans are great for use in various recipes - hummus, salads, soups, pasta dishes, etc.  I like that the simple ingredient list - only chick peas, water, salt, with no preservatives or colors added, as in many brands of beans.  They really are good for you - 269 cal, 12 g fiber, 15 g protein, 160 mg sodium per 1/2 c serving (3 servings per 14 oz can) [*edited to say that the cal/serving on the Carmelina label is likely incorrect - should be 269 cal per 1 c serving, according to various calorie websites and USDA lists canned garbanzo beans as 240 cal/1 cup serving].  I have not checked the sodium content of major brands of beans, but they likely are much higher.  These Carmelina garbanzo beans are really only very lightly salted, so if you are used to much saltier beans, you might not like these (but you can always add salt).  They have a nice "bite" texture to them, just right and not at all mushy.  These beans are imported from Italy.  This is the third kind of Mangia Carmelina beans that I have tried and all have been great.  A good value and nice to have on hand for quick recipes when there is not time to cook beans from scratch.

review/summary: melts in your mouth like flakes of cotton candy
review/text: I LOVE indian food but thought their dessert variety was limited until I started seeing these type of desserts in the indian stores.  I first thought it was some kind of cake and it's shaped like one and cut into small squares, but when you bite into it, it's soooo light and flaky and sweet --it tasted soooo good, sweet and soft that melted in my mouth like flakes of cotton candy. It's made so delicately and elegantly that it looks too good to eat - it looks so intricate like it would take MANY hours and lots of skill to make.  I finished off the whole box in less than half an hour.  It's not like any known US mainstream dessert that I've ever tasted.  American desserts or sweet snacks are sweet but they're also very heavy tasting but this soan papdi is very light.<br /><br />It's pricey for the amount you're getting, so if I were to buy it, I would buy it for friends when having coffee/tea or a light brunch or light luncheon. It would be great with coffee or tea and to serve to friends at a LIGHT tea luncheon get-together where your friends will worship the ground you walk on after tasting this!!  Take off the packaging before you serve it to them and just blithely lie and say you made it yourself and watch them beg you for the recipe and stare in puzzlement and envy! :-)

review/summary: Don't buy from Easy To Grow Bulbs
review/text: THe Easy To Grow Bulbs Company provides zero customer satisfaction.<br /><br />I always buy my wife an amaryllis bulb for Christmas, and have been doing so for almost 25 years. This year I ordered this very package from ETGB.* Weeks later I was still seeing no signs of life. I emailed the company and asked for a replacement. I got a letter back hinting that I was watering it improperly, or that I had not planted it in a timely manner, or that I was just being impatient. One month later the bulb is either dormant or dead, and further requests for a replacement were met with the equivalent of, "Sorry, tough luck."<br /><br />My wife is an experienced gardener and has never had a failed amaryllis bulb before. Therefore, I recommend that you only order from ETGB if you won't be needing them to make good if your bulbs are bad--because they won't.<br /><br />*(Not through Amazon, though.  I bought directly from the ETGB web site. Buying through Amazon may give you more leverage if you need it.)

review/summary: 5 star beef jerky from World Kitchen
review/text: Great flavor and a great expiration date to boot. I couldn't tell you the expiration date because my girlfriend took these to her house (but I do remember that I was happy with the expiration date). She bans me to eat this stuff, but I managed to eat one pack. HEAVEN! If you go to the grocery store, check the expiration date and you will see that a lot of times the good until date expired. Jack Link's Beef Steak Nuggets and these are my 2 favorite, but I like this a bit more than the Jack Link's. These aren't extremely spicy either. They have a nice flavorful kick. I also prefer these over the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Q9QIPM">World Kitchens Brown Sugar Beef Jerky, 12-Ounce Bag</a>, which are also delicious (a little too sweet though).

I plan to<br />purchase the brown sugar flavor next.

review/summary: No ingredients listed on amazon, high amount of MSG
review/text: I avoid MSG as much as possible, as high amounts cause migraines for me. I purchased this thinking "Natural" would mean it was not made with the addition of MSG. The taste is fine, texture is great, but the MSG caused a migraine that lasted for days. If you are sensitive to MSG do not purchase this jerky. I wish jerky manufacturers would disclose or stop using it all together.

review/text: Woodstock Farms Raw Almond Butter is really tasty, but more importantly, it is totally natural. I eat an all natural diet, and although many products make that claim, they are not. This product tastes great, arrived quickly, and satisfied my sweet tooth (which is difficult when eating naturally).

Big mistake the first package was all dirty with bugs, corn silk, and mold. I expect the package to have some corn silk and some (2 or 3 ) molded husks, but when I have to throw all 3 bags,  away that makes me mad and I'm not going to return husks I already opend and tried to wash. So it was a big waste of my money and thoses of you who gave them a good review were either working for them, lieing or are lucky they got good husks.

review/text: Okay, I love Dots; they tie with Red Vines as my all time favorite movie theatre candy.  On second thought, they may even surpass the trusty old Vines because Dots tend to vary the flavor options a bit (you've got your Tropical Dots, your Crows, your Ghost Dots, Valentine's Day Dots, etc.).  But whatever the flavor, they're a great movie candy.  And I love the idea of buying a bulk pack of twelve.  Keep `em at home for movie nights, or even sneak a box into the movie theatre. (Okay, yes - I suppose one should buy the boxes at the cineplex; but dang - have you seen those theatre prices?)<br /><br />With all of that said, I can't give the deal listed here a full five stars.  Why?  The price.  It may not be as ridiculous as some of the food "deals" that I've seen on this site, but the price still isn't anywhere near as low as you can find even at your local Target or Walmart (or even Dollar Tree).  For Dots, you're better off going to one of those stores.

review/summary: Great candy at a great price
review/text: When I found this deal for Dots, with the so-called theatre sized boxes for little more than a dollar, I leaped at the chance, buying two cases.  Dots are a great candy, flavorful and never imperfect.  Most people live far from the major factory and are stuck with 'old' Dots.  The candy is OK indefinitely; my aunt and uncle have had them out in a jar for years.  However, when they are fresh and soft, they are entirely different; entirely better.  The ones I got here were factory soft and fresh, making them great.<br /><br />Dots are the simplest candy imaginable.  If you like them and find them at a great price like this, get them while they last...

review/summary: Large sized cans, sealed for freshness - perfect!
review/text: I use a lot of olive oil in the kitchen - in Italian food, for dipping bread, and for frying. Olive oil contains healthy fats and antioxidants that can help fight heart disease and cancer.  Mantova Extra Virgin Olive Oil comes in a 3-liter can, and is sold in a two-pack with free SuperSaver Shipping.  Because the oil is sealed in a metal can, it stays fresher longer than olive oil sold in plastic containers.<br /><br />It has a light, fresh taste and a clean aroma that enhances every dish.  We especially like it for dipping - I add salt, oregano, garlic and cracked pepper to a dish of the oil, and we dip Italian bread in it.  It's one of our favorite appetizers.<br /><br />Olive oil is also wonderful for your hair and skin.  It absorbs quickly and isn't sticky.  I also add a tablespoon of olive oil to our cat's and dog's food, to improve digestion and make their coats shiny.  I've gotten to the point that I never buy canola, corn or sunflower oil anymore - olive oil is only a little more expensive and is so much better for us.<br /><br />If you're looking for extra virgin olive oil, Mantova is a great brand.  The two large containers will last a long time if kept in a cool, dark place like a pantry.

The mustard containers are very small, but the flavor of them is so full that its not the kind of thing you spread over a ham sandwhich... they are meant for small dipping like the pretzels they come with.  I will surely order this at least once a year. Highly recommended.

review/summary: What a waste
review/text: We tried this product tonight for the first time.  What a disappointment for both my 11 year-old daughter and me.  It's amazing just how bland this coating is.  It also has a disgustifying effect on the chicken.  My daughter rejected it, and rejecting food is something she very rarely does.  Our pet rats did not reject it.<br /><br />This is a product for the crowd who think Hostess products are good.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, I bought two boxes of this destructive product for the price of one.  So now I have that second unused box wasting space in my house.  I was going to leave that box somewhere off-property where it can be found by someone else to use.  But that would be a disservice to the other person.  So in the trash it goes.<br /><br />With even moderately tasty food, when one eats enough of it, one feels fine.  But when one fills up with chicken treated with Shake 'N Bake, one ponders what relief a gastric lavage would bring.  This product is absolute crap.

review/summary: Holy Hades!
review/text: So I purchased this thinking it would be a novelty item. I just wanted to see people choke, cough, spit and wheeze when they tried this. Quite the opposite happened. These became an IMMEDIATE crowd pleaser. The chip itself is as perfect as a kettle chip can get: crunchy, thick with a robust potato flavor and not greasy. The spices. Dear God the spices. It takes a few seconds, but when the habanero kicks in, yeah, you'll "feel alive". The level of heat does not take to your knees. I found myself going for more! Certainly ingesting these does not come without hazards (tear jerking restroom moments), but I guarantee you it is quickly forgotten after that bag stares you in the face when you open the pantry. I'll be ordering more once I'm down to four bags. For the rest of the nation buried under snow, a bag of this will put your body in the Bahamas.

review/summary: The spiciest chips EVER!!!!
review/text: I love eating spicy foods and so I was looking for chips that were really spicy because you can't find it anywhere besides dipping chips in salsa. I have tried all kinds of spicy chips, but this tops it by far. Usually it takes a while of eating the chips to feel that burn on your tongue, but after eating one chip of the Blair's habanero, you instantly get that kick of hotness on your tongue. The chips are nice and crunchy like the kettle cooked chips. I recommend this to any lover of spicy foods. I have already bought this twice on amazon and I will soon have to buy another box because it's just that good.

review/text: I am a hot food junkie and found these chips at a local grocery store.  I got addicted and kept searching for them again and again, but they must have been on a trial run, never to return.  Amazon fortunately had them, but in palette sized orders rather than a couple bags.  Oh well.  This is simply the most nuclear, face napalm, gastro grenading potato chip I have ever had.  If you're a sadistic snack aficionado like me, try these.  A half bag into it, you will be paying the price.

review/summary: Fire Burning
review/text: *Warning* These chips are like eating a raw habanero pepper.<br /><br />This is literally the hottest processed food product I've ever eaten. I use to think what I normally ate was pretty hot, until I tried these. They taste pretty good, but good luck trying to eat a whole bag in one sitting. I can barely get down 10 chips before my nose and eyes are watering and my mouth is on fire. I'd compare their taste, texture, and crunchiness to Tim's Cascade Jalapeno (which I love,) but they're probably around 5 times as hot as those chips. Don't get me wrong, these things are pretty tasty, but I'm still working on polishing off my first bag that I received 3 days ago.<br /><br />I'm probably going to keep some for myself to eat, since they don't go bad for a year from now, but the others I'm probably going to use for pranks on my family and friends. Only takes one chip to set your mouth on fire. =D

review/summary: Outright dangerous
review/text: I love spicy snacks and was looking for something a bit spicier than Flamin Hot Cheetos.  I have several bottles of Blair's hot sauces so I knew that I would definitely not be disappointed with the spice level on these chips.  The first few chips that I put in my mouth, were spicy, but more flavor than I expected.  So I ate a couple more.  Then the heat intensity starts to kick in. Unlike other habanero foods, this one had a bit of a creeper affect rather than hitting you like a freight train from the beginning.  Then my mouth started to burn and the tears started rolling.  God, how I love that feeling.  Sadistic, I know. They really do make you feel alive.  I keep several bags at work so I can have something to get over the afternoon hump around 3 pm.  They do the job well as I get a level of alertness that caffeine just can't deliver.  It also makes me appear like a more sensitive guy since I am crying the whole time.  Eating these chips has also produced a nice side effect for me - I am unbelievably hydrated throughout the day.  My skin has never looked better.  The only warning I would give when eating these chips is that the pepper powder they use is extremely light. So when you pop them in your mouth, you will inevitably get some up your nose via your nasopharynx.  It will make you sniffle like a coke addict from the 80s. A bit annoying but great for clearing up sinuses. Oh yeah, my best advice is that you should really wash your hands thoroughly before using the bathroom - like 2-3 times.  Otherwise a fate that I wouldn't even wish upon my worst enemy will await you. Let's just say I am prone to learning life lessons the hard way. i won't go into details but it involved milk and was something like a scene out of American Pie.

I research and found out u can only GE these via internet not in any store,  which is a bummer but extreme food website and Amazon always have great special.  So I recommended purchaseing a lot so you don't run out.<br />These are a great conversation piece at parties everybody always says same 2 things<br />1.  OMG THESE ARE SO HOT.<br />2.  I can't stop eating because these are so good.<br />Definitely have milk around to help the heat factor.  I now have my boyfriend hooked and a fan.  This last purchase I orders him the 14/5oz bag set.  He is in 7th heaven.  Definitely will last a while cause u can only eat so many cause of the heat but so tastey u wanna keep going back for more.<br />Remember have milk on hand LOL enjoy.

review/text: I rarely do product reviews on Amazon BUT after having the 1st bag I knew I had to say something!<br /><br />These chips are not for the faint. They have a wonderful kettle cooked crunch to them and the bag size is the perfect munching snack to watching a movie.  These are not only going to make a good snack for me (as I really like spicy foods) but will also make the perfect laugh when I let friends try them...<br /><br />These chips have a wonderful flavor and not too much spice (if any at all) when you first chomp into a them, but wait for it, after 5-10 second the burn starts to come usually about the time you reach for your second or third and by then it is too late.<br /><br />The burn lasts for a solid 10-15 minutes after eating a few handfuls and personally made me sweat a good deal as I finished off my first bag while watching a movie.<br /><br />These I would easily buy again and recommend them to ANYONE who wants a good laugh at someone else's expense OR of you really like painfully spicy hot sauce. Although they were a good deal spicier than I expected. If you know Blair's they are know for the very hottest of hot sauces and NOW I think they can also brag they have the hotest snacks!

Everything you love in a chip all rolled in to one.<br /><br />Do not be deceived by the fact that it says chipotle on the bag. This is some concentrated stuff here. Personally I can only eat 2-3 chips per serving. It's that hot.

I have looked for a truly hot chip for some time, and most fall seriously short.  For those not "appreciative" of the heat level of these chips, they are overwhelmed with the hot, and say it covers up the taste.  Not for me!  Actually, I could use them somewhat hotter, but they are not a disappointment.  Good heat, great with beer.

Also they have a nice hint of barbecue chip flavor, and that good crunch of kettle chips.<br />They are enjoyable to eat, and not just for the novelty of eating the hottest chip you can find.<br />I bought the case and shared a few bags with other lovers of hot foods.
