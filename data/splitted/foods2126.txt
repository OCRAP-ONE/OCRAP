review/summary: Best Buy for Strong Coffee
review/text: This coffee along with Timothy's Parisian Nights are the two I found that actually contain 25% more coffee than other K-Cups.  We like strong coffee and this one is the best price purchasing it through Subscribe and Save.  It seems to have changed since we first bought it years ago.  I would recommend Parisian Nights if money isn't a consideration.  I think the flavor is better but this one is good and strong.

review/summary: Bold and Flavorful
review/text: This Rainforest Extra Bold is quite good.  It is very strong but doesn't seem acidy to me.  I've tried a different Extra Bold that left a bitter taste - this leaves a decent taste behind without upsetting my stomach but still giving me a good wake-up kick in the morning.  It is also bold enough that I can't squeeze a second cup from each k-cup that I take with me to work.  While it's not as strong it still retains a good sturdy coffee flavor.

review/summary: Really good dark coffee
review/text: I bought this so I could get an espresso drink out of my Keurig.  The one downside of Keurig's is not being able to make a real espresso drink.  This blend is as close as I've come to a really strong cup of coffee and I've been able to make lattes and mochas out of it.  It's not as strong as a true espresso but for the convenience of a Keurig I think it fills the role nicely.

review/summary: Bold and smooth
review/text: I agree with other review that this is a nice bold coffee but at the same time very smooth without any bitterness.<br />Similar to Americano coffee sold at well known coffee shops that sell for close to $4. This comes out to $.40 a cup! I never buy coffee in the chain stores anymore. The Keurig coffee maker eliminates the need to find a good cup of Joe. I first got a trial of how good this coffee is when I was at a doctors office and they had this coffeemaker for the patients to make themselves a cup from. I soon saw one on a shopping network and ordered it and loved it but it was the mini one so I kept that for my office and bought the nice platinum model that is fantastic. Nice hot coffee and in different size choices. I do not know how the coffee comes out perfectly regardless of the size cup chosen. I think it has to do with the amount of water released during the process. I love the machine and this blend coffee.

review/summary: Trickle-Trickle Little Star
review/text: Timothy's Rainforest Espresso is great-tasting coffee; I only wish I could get a full cup.  When I press the start button the flow of water/coffee starts out great, but after a few seconds it drops off to a mere trickle and never (I mean never) fills the cup.  We don't have that type of problem with other K-Cups so I know it's not the coffee-maker.  Thus, I won't be purchasing this brand of coffee anymore.<br /><br />Despite what others have said about buying in bulk, trying to "trick" the coffee-maker, etc.; I didn't buy a coffee product to play games with.

review/summary: Very poor quality
review/text: The taste of this k-cup is great. It's not as bold as some of the other k-cups I enjoy, but it's the smoothest of all in the "extra bold" category.<br /><br />The problem, and reason for the low rating, is the quality control on these k-cups. I'm not sure if it's because of the 50 pack, or the brand Timothy's, but these K-cups have about a 75% failure rate in my Keurig machine. Coffee and coffee grinds go everywhere because the seal comes undone. I have to try to spoon out the coffee grinds in my cup, and clean up the mess afterwards. No other K-cup I've ever used as done this, so it's pretty frustrating.<br /><br />I probably will not try this 50 pack again, as having 40 of the 50 explode is pretty bad.

review/summary: Nothing "Espresso" or "Extra Bold" about it
review/text: Okay so I bought this based on its name.  Espresso.  Extra Bold.  Rainforest!!  Sounded good. Though there is very little extra bold and espresso about it (and i have no idea what rainforest would taste like).  My Kuerig brewer has 5 size settings. My default is the fourth which fills an average mug (the fifth is their travel mug size).  When I use this K-cup I must use the third size otherwise it is just too weak.  Folgers Lively Columbian is a much better cup of coffee and much better value than this otherwise I stock Jet Fuel for a bolder mug and one kcup can actually handle the travel mug size.  ( Also like Tully's Kona and GM Sumatran Reserve)  But beside the lack of brew strength I find it to have a weird finish to the taste.  I just didn't enjoy the taste but we all have different buds so you may like it.  My gripe lately with these K-cups is that some of them are sooo weak you literally need two to make a good mug of coffee and that is way too expensive for coffee at home.  So far I find "Timothy's" coffees on the weak side- I also bought their Decaf Columbian- what a rip off, brews like weak tea from the start! So weak!

review/summary: Good Basic Coffee, just bold enough to squeeze out a double brew
review/text: I always say, if you want weak coffee, water it down in your own cup, don't brew it that way! That said, my dislike about the Keurig is that you get at most an 8oz cup of coffee - I like my morning mug!  But I love the convenience of this little appliance.<br /><br />I picked up my Keurig at [Warehouse Store] and it included a ton of sample cups.  Out of 72 samples, there was only 1 that I thought made a decently rich strong cup of coffee.  Of course, I couldn't find that particular brand/blend, so began the search, and finally landed on this Timothy's product.<br /><br />So - to the point...These Timothy's Rainforest Extra Bold Espresso Kcups are bold enough that I can run the brewer twice on the same pod and still come out with an acceptable cup of coffee.  With one run through, it is a truly tasty bold cup (but not burned tasting like coffees from certain large chain out of the Northwest...)<br /><br />I'm sure there are bolder blends out there; but for $0.32/cup, this one works very well for me! (I went Subscribe & Save with this order)<br />Enjoy =D

review/summary: My personal favorite
review/text: I first learned of the Keurig system almost ten years ago.  At that time, I worked for one of the largest marketers of the systems in our area.  I had the chance to sample almost every brand and their different brews.  Timothy's traditionally always made some of the best brews for the system.<br /><br />I have left the company, but kept my brewer.  I can still purchase anything I want at cost (if I drive the 30 miles to pick it up).  I choose to use Amazon's subscription for ease of use.  It is only a couple of bucks more than cost, and includes free shipping.  No more trips for coffee, and sure I miss the old mates, but this so worth it.<br /><br />The coffee is smooth and strong.  I prefer a very strong cup of Joe.  I typically make Americanos from my espresso machine (a 3 oz double shot diluted w/ 5 oz water).  That is close to what this tastes like.  I don't know about its acidity, but I can say that it is in line with my palate.  No bitterness (like one famous brand).  No creama, but really, what do you expect.  This is not espresso, it is a strong brew made from Arabica.  Really, just a quick quality cup of coffee.<br /><br />I also order the decaf.  It is just as good

review/summary: Great Coffee Flavor, Bad Quality K-Cups
review/text: This has been my favorite K-Cup coffee for well over 9 months now, so I was very excited to be able to buy it on Amazon in large quantities at a reduced cost.  Unfortunately, while the flavor is still my favorite, I've had terrible luck with the K-Cups themselves.  Every second or third cup I brew leaves loads of coffee grounds in the cup.  I've had this happen on occasion with other K-Cups over the two years I've owned my Keurig, but NEVER to this extent.  I don't know if the foil cap is the cause of the problem or what, but it appears that every time the pin punctures the K-Cup it leaves a much larger than normal hole that causes the grounds to end up in the coffee.  At first I thought maybe it was a problem with my brewer, but I've used 4 other varieties since the problem began and I've had zero issues with those.  Obviously it's a issue with this particular product.

review/summary: Keurig K-Cups Cause Keurig Coffee Maker Problems
review/text: We are on our third Keurig Coffee Maker.  The original model has worked well for three years, although it's internal timer has given out. (We just turn it on and off)  The second and third machines were the B70 Platinum, and worked well for about 9 months, at which point they either refused to pump water through the K-Cup altogether, or "short cupped" us by pumping some of the water back into the reservoir. Keurig replaced the first, and the replacement began to act up in December.<br /><br />After two hours on the phone today with both Keurig and Green Mountain Coffee, their K-Cup division (Timothys, Tullys, Newman's, Caribou, etc.) it turns out that some K-Cups get "domed" because the "coffee is so fresh."  (The dome is apparently caused by gases emitted by the coffee grounds, creating a slight overpressure - bold coffees appear to be most susceptible to this phenomen.)<br /><br />When a "domed" K-cup is placed in the machine in accordance with the manual, however, the upper needle, which includes the water channels, can be clogged by grounds forced up into them by this internal overpressure condition.<br /><br />Keurig claims to have just discovered the problem and to be developing a solution, but in the interim, they advise puncturing the bottom of a "domed" K-Cup first by forcing it down on the lower needle before closing the top.  If the machine is already clogged, their recommended technique is a paper clip to ream out the water channels, then running water (without a K-Cup) into a measuring cup to verify that the various cup settings are producing the correct volume of water.  (None of this is addressed in the manual.)<br /><br />We've been buying the K-Cups from Amazon in bulk because of their good price, but have lately had two boxes of mostly "domed" Timothys Extra Bold Rainforest Expresso, which seem to have caused our difficulty.  (Keurig claims that they've not had any problems with the smaller 24 count boxes which they market directly.)<br /><br />There is a "best used by" date on each K-Cup, and most of our "domed" K-Cups seem to either approaching or beyond their use by date, so "caveat emptor" when buying in volume from Amazon and other quantity purveyors of K-Cups, where the boxes may spend more time in the warehouse than otherwise . . . .

review/summary: It pains me to give a one star review for this...
review/text: I really like the flavor of this coffee.  In fact it is one of my favorite varieties for the Keurig brewer.  It really is bold without being bitter.  Unfortunately, the quality of the K-Cups that this coffee arrived in are unacceptable. Having brewed about 30 cups of this coffee, we have had 9 cups that backed up and overflowed.  About half way through the brewing process, the flow of coffee out the bottom slows down, then stops, then the coffee starts "erupting" out the sides of the K-cup holder.  This machine is located in an office and is used by many people with many different brands/varieties of K-cups.  This is the only kind of K-cup that clogs like this. I really love the flavor, but the lack of quality with regard to the K-cup is unacceptable.

review/text: Coffee itself was good enough but after ordering on the subscribe and save, I just got notification that my next delivery would be shipping soon. The price was raised and I got no other notification of that fact. I think that something should have been sent asking if I'd want to pay the higher price, which of course I don't. At least I'm not sleeping, Amazon, and still have time to cancel. Just a nasty way to do business.

review/summary: Problem with grounds ending up in mug
review/text: I can't recommend this flavor for now because at least one out of five cups had a problem that resulted in grounds in my coffee. I've used this in two machines, one is less than a month old - same outcome. Maybe it's just a bad batch, I'd like to know if other reviewers are having similar problems. I've always bought Timothy's and hope that this is just an anomaly. Two out of five stars because the majority of brews made came out fine. Will update this review if I feel I can recommend this flavor again.

review/summary: Great coffee....BUT
review/text: I prefer a bolder cup of coffee.  This product definitely fits the bill, and we love it!!  However, they advertise that this contains 27% more coffee than the standard Rainforest expresso k-cups.  I believe that this feature is the reason that at least 60% of the cups we brew in our Keurig fails in the brewing cycle. The cycle is interrupted and shuts off and the k-cup overruns with coffee grounds, thus ruining your cup of coffee.  I have reported this to Timothy's but they have not fixed the problem to my knowledge.  Use at your own risk.

review/summary: Glad I read all the reviews!!!!!!!!  That is why I bought it.
review/text: Read several reviews about this coffee.  Let me first say it is coffee and not Espresso.  It has a hint of Espresso flavor.  It is a very dark roast bold flavor which is what I wanted.  Read through all the reviews about the K-Cups blowing out and malfunctioning.  I had this trouble with some other kinds.  The reviewer stated they shook the K-Cup first before using it.  Guess what?  IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!  No blowouts.  Perfect cup every time.  If you want pretty packaging then go to the store and spend more.  Comes in a basic cardboard box filled to the brim with K-Cups.  Opened the box (Which UPS smashed the hell out of) to double check the contents.  All were fine and in fact there were 53 K-Cups instead of 50.  Nice little bonus.<br /><br />I would recommend this coffee to anyone who wants a bold dark roast coffee.

review/text: The flavor was wonderful, but every single K-cup was defective. The coffee would spill out the sides of the machine. I have tried many other brands and flavors of K-cups, and have had zero problems, so the problem was definitely the packaging on these cups. The filter was not installed very well.

review/summary: Smooth Earthy Bold
review/text: I've tried many different bold Keurig coffees.  This is one of the best, it is smooth and strong with a nice finish.  I like Caribou's Mahogany better in this regard, but it is only available from Kuerig and the auto-reorder price for the Rainforest 50 cup box is hard to beat.  For the money this is a very close second.  If you like a stronger bold with just the right amount of kick or bitterness, the Coffee People Organic bold is a great coffee.  Also Emeril's big easy bold is a very strong Parisian blend and worth a try if you like strong coffee.

review/summary: Wow, I'm impressed even though I don't normally like Timothy's coffees
review/text: I picked up a box of this to have around the house for holiday guests. I don't normally like Timothy's coffees, especially their flavored blends because they tend to lack flavor and depth. HOWEVER, this one is amazingly good and far better than I was expecting. Although it has a slightly different flavor than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M2BM5W">Green Mountain Organic Espresso Extra Bold K-cup</a> it was along the same lines in boldness, sweet undertones, and dark roasting. I think if I had the two in front of me that I'd be more likely to opt for Timothy's, it really is that good.<br /><br />The K-cup is really full, so even brewed on the largest cup setting, the coffee comes out rich and wonderful.<br /><br />I also like the no nonsense 50 pack of k-cups. The expiration date was about six months out. If you like GMC Extra Bold coffees, I suspect you'll like this one and it's lower price.

review/text: This is first time Ive gotten K cups that are made so cheap that the GLUE holding the top onto the k cup comes losse from the steam of the machine, and makes coffee grounds pour out and into my coffee and all over my machine.  I Bought 50 Of these and I Cant return them, and I Cant find anywhere to contact the seller , because the seller is AMAZON itself.  Im so upset, because I love my keriug machine, and now its all messed up, taking me over 30 Minutes after each of trying these particular K-cups.  So I Just have to throw them out.  DONT ORDER THESE!  I dont know if its TIMOTHY's MAking them, and they are so cheaply made, or if it's AMAZOn who makes them and uses Timothy;s Name, but either way they will ruin your MACHINE and RUIN your morning cup of Coffee!  This is The first Time its happened with any k-cups, but I will not order Timothys anymore because of it.  If I could return them, and get another batch, would be cool, but they wont let me return!  WHY? I only used about 5 , and 3 Of the 5 RUINED my coffee. I started looking closely at foil overlay and almost everyone, is loose and not sealed securely.  Now I Got 45 Of them to toss Out.  DONT BUY!

review/text: I've tried most k-cup flavors, including all the Caribou, Timothy, and Emeril varieties. This is one of the very few that allows you to get a large cup of strong coffee that doesn't look or taste watered down. The flavor is good; you won't need sweetener. There's also no after taste. It is dark, however, so some added creamer or milk might be preferred.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: coffee backs up
review/text: I have read many reviews on this subject and was having the same problem  Coffee backs up, grouunds in coffee, stops short.  It appears the problem is the way the coffee settles into the pod and obstructs the flow of water through it.  I have found that if I give a gentle shake to the pod, to lossen the coffee inside, it eliminates the problem. Maybe I am just lucky, but I had maybe 20-30 bad pods over six months time. After I started shaking the pods to make sure the coffee was loose and not packed, no more problems. I enjoy this brand very much and should give it five stars.

review/summary: simply delicious!
review/text: This coffee is by far the most flavorful I've found among the k-cups tried; it is just fabulous! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because in the last couple of boxes, we have had several "blow-outs" where the foil has come unglued from the k-cup and the cup needs to be discarded because it is full of grounds. Of course, this raises the price considerably; that combined with the product price increase makes it not so fabulous. Prior to these, we've had mostly good luck with them with only an occasional one here and there.

review/summary: Not Espresso nor Extra Bold
review/text: Been using Keurig K-Cups for quite a while and enjoy a good quality espresso as well as a strong cuppa every day. I like this Brand and give a few flavors a try every now and then, this flavor didn't meet its claims - it is indeed smooth but does not have the 'extra bold' flavor nor does it resemble espresso. I would classify this as mild at best (even with the smallest Keurig pull of 5oz.) I'd return it if I could, I have 45 of these that I can admire unused.  As a comparison, one of my favorite flavors is Green Mountain Extra Bold Sumatran Reserve.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M9ZLEG">Green Mountain Fair Trade Organic Sumatran Reserve Extra Bold (24 K-cups) Keurig</a>

review/text: This is not my favorite k-Cup offering out there, but it's not too bad.  I felt the flavor didn't live up to my expectations of "espresso", it wasn't bold enough for me.  It starts out with a nice flavor, but ends with too much bitterness and not enough boldness.  I drink it black, so I'm sure some cream would soften the bitterness.  I wanted more flavor, something that left me with that flavor on my tongue after a cup similar to the experience with a cup of espresso coffee.  I didn't get that, just a lingering bitterness.

review/summary: It's not really Espresso, but it is good all the same!
review/text: First, let's start with a definition: "Espresso is a concentrated coffee beverage brewed by forcing hot water under pressure through finely ground coffee". Although some chains claim an "espresso roast" for their beans, many different degrees of roasting are used for classic (Italian) espresso drinks. Yes, the Keurig does kind of "force" hot water through, but not anywhere near the pressure of an espresso machine.<br /><br />Now, to this product: I really enjoy Timothy's Rainforest Espresso coffee. I use the smallest cup size setting on my Keurig B70 (5 1/4 oz.) and although there is no crema (the dark reddish-brown foam on the top of an authentic cup of espresso) the taste is rich and bold with just a hint of satisfying and pleasant bitterness. This, along with Newmans Own Organic Special Blend, are my go-to coffees for my Keurig. If you like a strong coffee you might want to give this a try, but I still go to a coffee shop when I am hankering for a real shot of espresso.

review/summary: For my hardcore strong & bold black coffee drinker - this is his favorite!!!!
review/text: My husband likes his coffee strong, bold, smooth and black.  We've had had Keurig coffee brewing machines for the last three years, and have tried many, many bold coffees.  Until we found the Rainforest Espresso (which I find using the espresso name strange for just a cup of self brewed coffee),  he was not in love with his cup of coffee.  The moment I served the very first cup of the Rainforest - his eyes lit up and I could tell he was pleasantly satisfied.  It is the only type I'll buy for him - he won't go back.<br /><br />I don't like my coffee that strong, and I can hardly even breathe in the odor of his just brewed cup - it is far too overpowering!  But to each his own.<br /><br />Do I think this clogs my machine?  I really cannot be sure.  We do the routine maintenance on our Keuring, including cleaning the metal spiked piercer with a toothpick.  Since we've done that, we've had far less problems with the clogging and grounds.  I truly believe that is a Keuring issue, not a Timothy issue....

I know we "committed coffee drinkers" have already compromised ourselves but using the Keurig coffee maker, I find that Tully's has done the best job, so far,in my experience, with producing a fresh tasting cup of coffee.  I still find my favorite to be Tully's French roast, which I buy at Costco because the price is better than on Amazon.  Come on Amazon, try to at least come close to Costco's price!

Try this--you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Good tasting but not really a bold flavor
review/text: After reading many reviews of Rainforest Extra Bold Espresso we decided to give it a try as a stable mate to the Timothy's Midnight Magic and Coffee People Jet Fuel which we love and have  bold rich tastes.<br /><br />We have found this coffee disappointing from a bold standpoint. It tastes watered down on the larger cup setting which we use for the other two coffees and we only find it flavorful as a mid size cup .<br /><br />So if you enjoy a smaller cup of espresso this could be for you. Just don't expect much flavor on the larger cup setting.

review/text: I prefer stronger & bolder coffees.  This coffee is good only on the 5.25 oz(small cup). I have to use 2 of these K-cups for one mug & that to me is a waste because I drink 3-5 cups a day. However, if you just want an expresso shot 1-2x's/day, this coffee will serve its purpose.

review/summary: Bold, rich, dark roast great taste
review/text: I like roast without a burnt flavor yet I like a bold cup of coffe.  This has a great balance between the two.  It is a full rich blend with only a very mild hint of a very mild burnt aftertaste.  Hardly noticeable at all but still there in the background.  However, it does not detract from the full rich flavor of this cup.  If you are looking for a milder cup of coffee I would suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002APWQ0K">Timothy's World Coffee Kona Blend K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>

Now 2 out of my last 3 shipments the whole box was defective and won't brew a whole cup.  It messes up the brewer and causes it to flash descale after every cup.  As soon as I use it with another brand or run it with no k cup, descale goes away.  I figured this out after descaling the brewer 3 times.  I canceled my subscription.
