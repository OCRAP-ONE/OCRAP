review/summary: VERY GOOD! Now make it last longer
review/text: It is very much like eating apple pie without the calories/sugar/fat ( for a few minutes... I recommend trying it.<br />I've tried the Chocolate Chip Mint Ice Cream - and it too was good, but after chewing it for a while the mint starts tasting like any other mint gum.  I tried the Strawberry Shortcake version- and for some reason som sticks tasted better than others, I don't really care for that.<br />SO far the apple pie wins for this brands new line of gum.

It really took away the urge to eat something sweet (which would have equaled hundreds of calories if I would have  eaten some chees cake!)All I needed was a glass of milk to make it seem like the real deal! I'm actually chewing a piece right now...only 5 calories! WOW!

review/summary: Excellent substitute for a real dessert - now find a way to make it last longer!
review/text: John V. Karavitis  I bought a pack of these at Target a couple of days ago, it was an impulse purchase, and quite unlike me.  I haven't chewed gum in years.  But the flavor option (mint ice cream was the other one) was compelling, as was the fact that this gum was sugarless.  (If you go to their website, it contains sorbitol, a sugar alcohol which shouldn't raise insulin levels, along with what appears to be every artificial sweetener available.)  Yes, it tastes JUST EXACTLY LIKE apple pie.  In fact, if you are on a low-carb diet, or just want something to satisfy your sweet tooth to avoid reaching for an after-dinner dessert, this is it.  As another reviewer noted, Wrigley needs to make this "last longer".  That may not be a real possibility, maybe there would be someway to make the gum even smaller, like Chiclets, so that one can chew on two or three in succession, and still stay at the 5 calorie level.  Great product, and I'm looking forward to all the exciting flavor possibilities that Wrigley is willing to take a chance on!  John V Karavitis, John Karavitis, Karavitis

review/text: This gum is amazing!  I am trying to get away from eating so much sugar - but I love desserts!  This gum is a wonderful compromise.  I would not have thought it possible to wrap up the flavor of apple pie into a stick of gum - but they did it and the flavor is outstanding!  I was also surprised at how long the flavor lasts.  Obviously, the strength begins to wane after a while, but I found that if I stopped chewing for about 30 seconds and then started up again, much of the flavor was back and lasted until I was tired of chewing.  Wonderful invention, Wrigley's!  *Please* keep this available from now on - your Dessert Delights gum may just be the answer to my dieting/love of dessert woes!

review/summary: Dessert gum is great!
review/text: A friend suggested this gum to me when I was dieting in place of eating sweets. I wish I could tell you it will help you lose weight, but of course it doesn't promise that. But it is a very nice gum to chew when you are looking for something sweet.  The flavor lasts a longer time than other gums. I'd say it is fairly strong the first half hour of chewing, then still has some flavor even after that, though it is milder.<br />As others have mentioned this apple pie flavor is hard to find for me too. I sometimes find single packs, high-priced, but it is almost impossible to find the multipacks. I sure hope they don't eliminate this flavor or these dessert gums because they are great.<br />I suggest you try the other flavors too: key lime pie, strawberry shortcake, orange creme, etc. I have never seen the rainbow sherbet around here or the root beer float, but I just bought the root beer here on Amazon to try and will write a review after trying it.<br />Oh, and if you are an aunt it is your obligation and duty to always carry gum for your nieces and nephews.

review/text: This is my second try at the dessert gum flavors by Extra. My first try was the strawberry shortcake flavor, which tasted fine but had a weird aftertaste. This flavor is much better in my opinion.<br /><br />This tastes exactly like an apple pie, or as close to it as gum can get. The flavor doesn't last nearly as long as I want it to, but for that initial 1-2 minutes there's a really great burst of flavor. This is pretty much the only reason I took the 1 star off.<br /><br />Overall, I will be buying this flavor again.

review/text: This gum fills your mouth with intensely sweet flavors of apple pie.  It's a huge burst of flavor, but the sweetness subsides within a few minutes, and the flavor becomes noticeably milder as well though it doesn't go away entirely.  If you only want to chew the gum for the amount of time one would normally take to consume a small slice of apple pie, it's fine; but if you want to chew it longer, you may be disappointed at the rapid drop-off of sweetness and flavor.

However, that being said, I love that it postpones, and in many cases, eliminates the urge to go to the fridge for something bad-for-me. I love the flavor of the Mint Chocolate Chip, the Key Lime and, especially, the Orange Cremesicle (or whatever they call it). The others are good, but not my favorites. I have not tried the Apple Pie, but my friend who shares the same taste opinions in foods, says it is a bit tangy and fakey tasting. She says the ones named above are better. -db

review/summary: Wonderful! My favorite green tea, even better than Matcha!
review/text: This is my favorite green tea, and believe me, I have tried so many. Green tea is so good for you. It helps you digest your food, helps raise your metabolism, is just good on so many levels. I have tried many, even from the Lipton line, and most of the other famous/store/specialty tea stores. (I even write about tea in my books. When I say I love tea, I mean it.) Well, this Green Tea with honey is just fabulous. It's got a real, honest-to-goodness honey flavor. Not some artificial flavor, or something pretending to taste like honey. It takes like REAL honey! If you decide to add actual honey to this tea, start small.<br /><br />As to the green tea part of things, it doesn't make my tea water super cloudy like my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B2SVOS">The Republic of Tea, Double Green Matcha, 50-Count</a> does. Now that tea has the strongest green flavor I've tried, and I drink it for the health, not at all for the (dead fish) taste.<br /><br />With <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PHG">Lipton Green Tea, Honey, Tea Bags,1.2 Ounces 20-Count Units (Pack of 6)</a> it's much lighter but still a true green-tea flavor. Personally I go with the decaf most of the day, just not for breakfast.<br /><br />If you like green tea, or honey for that matter, do give this a try. It's smooth, full flavored, I just love it!<br /><br />Sheri Gill

review/summary: Cream of Rice Cereal
review/text: Rice products have always been a "comfort" food for me. As a child I enjoyed Cream of Rice cereal, rice with milk and sugar, and rice pudding. Lately I have not been able to find Cream of Rice cereal in the grocery stores in my area. Not only that but stores around here no longer stock short grain, sticky, rice because they say it doesn't sell. When I was younger you couldn't find long grain rice in the stores.<br /><br />I recommend Cream of Rice cereal to anyone who, like myself, enjoys rice as a comfort food.

review/summary: Mmm...Delicious Nostalgia
review/text: When I was a little kid, I remember my grandmother making me this for breakfast every morning.  Living in the Pacific Northwest, autumn and winter mornings are known to be more than a *little* chilly, so Cream of Rice was oftentimes the go-to option.  I'm a HUGE stickler for texture, so oatmeal and I have always been at odds with one another, and cream of wheat has too much of its own flavor for my sensitive taste buds.  As I grew up, I opted for faster more readily available options for the on-the-go rush that Americans always seem to be in, but after I came home from a hospitalization, I was told to stick to soft, bland foods.<br /><br />My immediate thoughts were recollections of delicious mornings at my grandmother's house!<br /><br />I always make mine with whole milk and no salt, then drizzle in a little bit more milk to cool it down and make it the same consistency my grandmother used to.  I don't typically put in other additives for flavor because I love the standard flavor when cooked with milk.  I also use Cream of Rice as a thickener in cream-based soups as an alternative to flour or corn starch, and use it as a component in my homemade rice pudding, too.  Stores around here still carry it, so that's not really an issue for me, but regardless of its accessibility, I highly recommend the product to anyone!

review/text: Odd that you cannot find it anymore in stores.  Anyhow, I just love this because it reminds me of my childhood and it's just a simple breakfast with versatility - mix in some fresh fruit, or with a dab of butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon (my personal favorite).  It tastes so much better to me than cream of wheat.  I also ordered from Amazon when I saw it there.  I was talking to a friend of mine who's husband was recently diagnosed with colon cancer and I thought this would be something he could easily eat.  Plus, I am sure it's perfect for babies even though I enjoy it so much myself.

review/text: I have been purchasing Cream of Rice from Amozon since January 2011.  I cannot find the cereal in any of our stores locally or around our area.  I am so happy Amazon has given me the oppotuity to buy it from them.  At first I was getting it every 2 months, ran out,. changed it to every month,  have enough to last so have changed it to 3 months.  I have to try to eat gluten free products.  Cream of Rice is very good for my stomach problems.  Amazon agrees to ship whatever time you want their product and are willing to change dates whenever you need to.  Amason is a much better company to deal with than some others when you order over the internet.  Thank you Amazon.<br /><br />Nora E. Schmidt

review/text: Like so many others I enjoyed Cream of Rice as a youngster only to be dismayed at not finding it in stores as an adult. Thanks to Amazon I will soon be enjoying it once again. The baby-specific rice cereals are a poor substitute with their pulverized texture, a substitute that I will no longer find necessary. One thing I noticed on delivery of the product is that Nabisco has removed their trademark from the boxes. I don't know if they are distancing themselves from this delicious product for some reason but I think it would be a mistake. Cream of Rice is a classic that deserves to be on the shelf of every supermarket in the country. This is great stuff and I intend to enjoy every bit of it.

review/text: I wanted to look up cream of rice to see how it is produced and I found this site on Amazon, where they appear to sell this kind of product.  I was surprised since I thought they were only into books and music.  I was further surprised to hear that so many people were having a hard time finding it and that it cost nearly five bucks a box to get it online.  I buy it all the time from Cub and eat nearly a box at a time.  It cost less than three dollars a box here in MN. I adorn the cooked rice with a tablespoon of butter and about a quarter cup of heavy whipping cream and another of white sugar.  I intentionally make it very thick and lumpy so the cream makes it like a thickened stew and the lumps are like dumplings.  People think it sounds awful until they take a taste of mine and they rarely go back to the former slurry they thought they liked until they tried mine.

review/text: When I spent time in N Italy a few years back, several people recommended Lavazza...so I was eager to try these pods when I purchased my new machine.  The flavor is good, decent amount of crema, smooth but rich....  However--and it is a  big however--at least ten percent of the two boxes I purchased were defective.  The pods were not sealed properly and had big gaping holes where the coffee was leaking out...so you also lost the proper pressurization...  I guess if I was going to buy Lavazza again, I would not purchase in this format...

They had been the main reason that I ordered this specific frosting at this time (I wanted something colorful for the birthday) but I tried them and didn't like the taste at all. I ended up coloring the frosting with natural food colors and left the dots off completely. Next time I'll probably order colored Sprinkelz instead, they're also natural, and maybe they'll taste better. But the frosting itself is great.

review/text: We just love these mixes. They are all delicious.  My family loves cupcakes and these make great ones, 24 at at time. It is all I use now. I order them so as not to run out. The flavor and texture is like homemade. The frosting, which I am reviewing,  is fabulous.  I cannot stand the canned frosting...yuk. Do everyone a flavor favor and use real butter only for the frosting. (moderation)  It makes all the difference in the world. If the cake is not sweet enough for you just add a little sugar but for us it is just fine and  with the sweet frosting it is not a sugar overkill. I love it is all organic and tastes this good!  Easy to make too. The sprinkles that come with this are a nice taste/texture addition too and they also are all natural. Try the chocolate cake with vanilla frosting and yellow cake with chocolate frosting...yum!

review/text: The Mint Milano cookies are wonderful. They have a light and crispy texture with a mild mint chocolate taste. The flavor reminds me a lot of the chocolate mint Girl Scout cookies although the texture of the 2 cookies are very different (the girl scout cookie is much denser).<br /><br />Unfortunately the cookies usually arrive with very few intact and several of mine were even broken into multiple pieces. They still taste pretty good though.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts copied from the actual package (July 2011):<br /><br />Serving size 2 cookies (25g/ 0.9oz)<br /><br />Servings per container about 8<br /><br />Calories per serving 130<br /><br />Calories from fat 70<br /><br />Total Fat 7g<br /><br />Saturated Fat 5g<br /><br />Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol less than 5 mg<br /><br />Sodium 65mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate 16g<br /><br />Dietary Fiber less than 1g<br /><br />Sugars 8g<br /><br />Protein 1g<br /><br />Vitamins A and C 0%<br /><br />Calcium 0%<br /><br />Iron 4%<br /><br />FYI, I purchased my cookies during 100 degree weather and except for some of the chocolate melting onto the inner wrapper the cookies were fine (I used 2 day shipping which might make a difference since the cookies weren't in the heat that long).<br /><br />At 15.88 for 4 bags of cookies the price per bag is 3.97 which is 48 cents more than the price printed on the cookie bag (3.49).

review/summary: OK, but not up to normal Milano standards.
review/text: I guess I should've known: I checked out the prices for the various permutations of the Milano brand name and this was the cheapest.  The cookies arrived in fair condition, with some of them broken already.  Slight breakage is okay, since we break them up to eat them anyway.  However, when they are broken to the point of powder, they become useless.  I believe that these were overbaked or the mix failed.  There was a powdery texture to the cookie instead of the smooth surface.  It's a subtle difference but the 'Milano' experience is very specific.  At these prices, they better be perfect.  These cookies weren't.<br /><br />I know Pepperidge Farm products; my parents lived in Norwalk, CT near their factory.  I have shopped at the company store.  What's amazing is that their products are perfectly good at the expiration date or even one year later.  However, in the case of the product above, they were not good right out of the factory and thus they were discounted.

review/summary: Classic Cookies
review/text: All of the flavors I've tried are great; but my favorite are the mint.<br /><br />I was concerned re the shipping issue based on other reviews.  When they arrived, the cookies were packed so tightly into a box filled with canned goods that the outer carton was pushed out of shape right on top of where the cookies were - which carton was pretty battered on that location, as one might expect from an incorrectly packed carton.  Amazon, what is up with your packaging logic?  It's so weird what you do when packing things....<br /><br />Anyway, I figured the whole batch of cookies would be crushed.  To my amazement, only 3 of the cookies were broken (out of a pack of 4 bags).  I think that was a fluke really.  Anyway, otherwise they were fresh etc.  The only other odd thing was that these seemed to be different cookies than what I was used to.  They seemed to be thinner.  I've noticed since moving from the West Coast to the East Coast that a lot of products seem different here in various ways, so I figured it was either that, or maybe I was imagining it; but I don't think so.  Anyway - I actually preferred the thinner ones, as the overall flavor balances were better and the texture was more appealing.<br /><br />So while my shipping story was a success, I can't claim that the product was really properly packaged, and I wouldn't therefore want to leave a review claiming that.

review/text: I bought it for about $11. It's such an affordable price. The per oz price is even competitive with the larger boxes (of non-snack size bags) cheez-its at grocery stores!<br /><br />The white cheddar is my favorite flavor; I think it's sharper than the original cheddar one.<br /><br />My only complaint about this order is that it seems very slightly less fresh than it should be. I had just bought 13.7 oz boxes of the white cheddar and the original at the grocery store shortly before this order arrived. So in comparison, the snack-size bags that I ordered seem slightly less crunchy than the ones I got from the grocery store. But I think if I didn't have the other boxes to compare it to, I wouldn't have even noticed. So I would still recommend this product!

review/text: When i ordered these they were $12 for a box of 36 bags- so that's like 3 bags for $1_ i like to snack- and tend to eat too much if eating from a large bag or box- so i like to get these portion controlled snacks when the price is right. I would prefer a parmesan or swiss over this flavor- the white cheddar is kinda bland compared to the other flavors- it lacks the zest of a sharper of more flavorful cheese.<br />I would not buy this flavor again- but to each their own.

review/summary: might be better than Latini!?
review/text: Last night I have tried out the Bucatini for the first time from Faella - WOW, they were so great!<br /><br />I had Latini Bucatini before, and yes, those were outstanding as well, compared to Delvedere or De Cecco (which you can simply forget, they don't play in the same league...).<br /><br />I made my own (vegetarian) version of a sauce all' amatriciana, using Morningstar Farm's Bacon strips, cut in slices and fried in butter with a fist-sized white onion (cut) and fresh garlic (not minced out of a jar!), rounded up with a good San Marzano tomatoe passata. And what should I say - we were blown away!<br /><br />The sauce is great, and the wonderful Bucatini made the dish perfect. They had just the right consistence, the right thickness, the right taste, the right everything - I fully recommend this Pasta!<br /><br />Can't wait to try the other varieties as well.<br /><br />Oh, and the price is even below the Latini price, imagine!

review/summary: schar products are really good overall
review/text: My 14 yr old son has celiac and finding products a kid likes is difficult.  He likes all the schar products.  I have also found using a corn based spaghetti pasta does better than an all brown rice spagetti.  He says it is "most real".  I rinse it after cooking (all gf pastas do better for somereason if you rinse them after cooking/straining).  With all gf pasta there is a fine line between "al dente-not cooked-and overcooking"  , but I found schar has more time to forgive!

review/text: If you just love spaghetti, and have to have it, cook these noodles in AMPLE water and stir frequently, and all will be well.  Their taste and texture is quite nice as long as they are not over-cooked.  However, if you cook them like wheat pasta, you'll end up with a clumpy, unevenly cooked mess.<br /><br />I prefer the penne and fusilli, for which preparation is really a no-brainer.<br /><br />I cook all of them for the minimum time given on the packet instructions and rinse briefly with cool water.<br /><br />(Guests have not noticed that these are gluten free pastas.)

review/summary: A delightful change after 3 years of spaghetti squash
review/text: After my husband [who is a diabetic as well] was diagnosed as gluten intolerant in 2007 I set out on a quest to find someway to eat spaghetti that had some semblance of real spaghetti and still keep his carb count under control.  I discovered spaghetti squash which was a fascinating, if not terribly tasty choice.  Just this past year I gratefully learned about Schar gluten free spaghetti and once we tried it we never looked back.  Although the carb count went out the window, the taste, visual and oral senses took over and we've been thoroughly enjoying the Schar spaghetti since that time.  I can not tell the difference between 'regular' spaghetti and the Schar pasta.  The spaghetti is great buttered but covered in the tastiness of spaghetti sauce, plus my additions, the Schar spaghetti is wonderful.  My husband thinks he has hit the jackpot as he LOVES spaghetti.<br />As far as the carb count goes we have the Schar on special occasions and do not over load his system with the carbs.  It keeps his spirits high to have something special once in a while.<br />BTW- It takes 11 minutes to cook the spaghetti.

review/text: With over a decade of experience with gluten-free food, I think I've tried every gluten-free noodle on the market. Many turn to paste in the pot or are otherwise inedible.<br /><br />Schar noodles are by far the best we've tried.<br /><br />These spaghetti noodles are as good as the real thing.<br /><br />One caveat, though: Boil the noodles very gently. Even then, you won't end up with many long strands. They do tend to break up. Eating them while twirling probably won't work out for you.<br /><br />But you will like the taste.

review/text: I am surprised by the negative reviews.  This is a great product.<br />As one of the negative reviewers said, you definitely need to use LOTS of water and you cannot make more than one package at a time and it does require stirring.  But like other pastas you must stir it a lot when first placing the pasta in boiling water.  All pastas develop a sticky coating initially and will clump together if not stirred A LOT!!  After the sticky coating is dispersed by the water it does not require any more stirring than regular spaghetti.  Wish I had known this 25 years ago.

review/text: This product cannot be cooked more than 1 package at a time, and even then you will need to watch and stir it lot (be prepared for a workout).  The consistency is like rice not pasta. So the water becomes milky and if you don't cook it correctly (which is difficult if you really want it al dente), it can be very chewy.  The taste does not lend itself to authenticity.  I wish I had not bought it and am stuck with the other packages :(

review/text: I first bought this at Walmart in Mesa, AZ. Came home to Cali and could not find it here. When I found it on Amazon, I was really happy. This pasta tastes just like regular pasta. The one thing that I notice about all gluten free pasta is that they do not reheat well. This one does if it is in a sauce like for lasagna. If you have the noodles cooked and need to reheat for a recipe, just drop them in boiling, salted water with a little oil for 2-3 minutes and it is great!

review/text: I have tried many brands of GF pasta and this one is the only one I've found that tastes just like normal spaghetti with normal pasta texture. I do not understand the negative reviews. While it is made from corn it does NOT taste like corn (or even remotely smell like corn). The really awesome thing besides the taste is that Schar DOES NOT use genetically modified corn...which almost all corn products here in the US now are. Even my husband who has no need to eat GF loves this pasta. I didn't even know about this product until I went in a local health food store and asked the clerk which GF pasta they sell the most of (they sell approx. 5 or 6 different brands) and she said: "hands down we sell more Schar than any other" she said it was the one brand they constantly run out of. It says on the package that it's Europe's #1 selling pasta and I can see why.

review/text: For those of you out there that are new to gluten free foods...such as myself, the pasta experience will be quite disappointing.  Maybe it was just this particular brand...I don't know. Don't get me wrong...I love pasta and I consume it quite regularly. So when I suddenly switched to this new gluten free diet because you hear how much healthier it is, I thought I'll give it a try.<br /><br />First off, expect to cook the spaghetti longer then regular wheat pastas. The water will start to look thick and cakey. I suppose that's normal too. As you cook beware of the odor which I can't describe. The noodles will be very sticky so I advise putting in olive oil in the water but that didn't do the trick as well as I thought either. The noodles do have a heavier consistancy but as for the taste...it was just ok. It made me quite bloated after eating it. Wonder what that was about. Would I eat this again? No.

review/text: There's nothing Plain Jane about the performance of this product. The aroma and flavor are heavenly, mouth-wateringly vanilla-y as soon as I open the bottle. It's a good value. As another reviewer said, you need only 1/4 teaspoon of powder for every 1 teaspoon of liquid extract called for in a recipe. Or, if you're like me and always add more vanilla than the recipe calls for, use as much as a 1/2 teaspoon per teaspoon, and your baked goods will taste decadent!<br /><br />One thing I especially appreciate is the strong vanilla flavor without the alcohol of liquid extracts, which allows me to use the powder in uncooked creations, like smoothies, fruit salad, and as an unexpected accent in salad dressings.

review/summary: Excellent Vanilla Powder
review/text: Husband wanted some vanilla powder to sprinkle on his morning lattes. Searched many stores and couldn't find a local supplier. Once again Amazon was a great source.<br /><br />He likes the flavor and the shaker works well. I like the size of the container (since it wasn't ordered to cook with we had no use for a large container or pound of bulk powder).<br /><br />In response to unhappy reviewer - nowhere does this product claim to be "pure" i.e. 100% vanilla. Two accurate descriptions mention the cane juice and the silica. Yes, cane juice is a form of sugar and therefore the source of the sweetness. Silica is a mineral commonly used as a flow agent for powders. (It is also an ingredient in many other items including glass, fiber optics, cosmetics, and supplements.) It is misleading to insinuate that silica=sand=glass.<br /><br />This is a good product and it is exactly what it claims to be, "a vanilla powder that adds sweetness and enhances flavor." Glad we found it.

review/text: Very tasty, worked perfectly in a cookie recipe and two different muffin batches.  It didnt even occur to me at first that I needed a vanilla extract substitute, but when it did, I'm glad I found this.  Will definitely buy again.
