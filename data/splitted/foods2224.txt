review/summary: Convenient? Not A Chance
review/text: Like other reviewers I found this tea to be very weak. Tea needs to STEEP. And really, how hard is it to open a teabag?? And all that plastic an foil waste from the K-cup! Let the Keurig make you a nice cup of hot water for the teabag and be done with it.

review/summary: Right Box, Wrong Tea
review/text: I really love this tea, it's my favorite. I like the mildly sweet flavor, and it is a medium strength tea, not too weak and not too strong. I haven't tried the caffeinated version yet, but I hope to in the future. Unfortunately I have to rate this 4 stars as one of the boxes I received was filled with English Breakfast Tea instead of Earl Grey. This was probably a packing issue with the manufacturer as the box was correct (Twinings Earl Grey). I received a refund, but it was still inconvenient and I hope it doesn't happen again.

review/summary: Not my favorite k-cup Earl Grey
review/text: I like Earl Grey...at least I THINK I do as I have always enjoyed the Bergamot orange flavor/aroma of it. This product, however, leans too far in the direction of lemon for me...not enough orange (I like the combination of both.) I don't know if it is simply too much Bergamot for my taste, not enough black tea, or the k-cup is the wrong vehicle for this brand. Then again, maybe it IS the way it is supposed to taste and I have just been acclimated to other brands. I don't use sugar or honey, so it isn't that.<br /><br />Either way, I like the Bigelow brand better(or even the Celestial Seasonings which is further toward the orange side, not exactly Earl Grey-y, but still good.) Twinnings is a fine name in teas, but this particular product isn't MY preference.

review/summary: Tea is fine ... K-Cups suck!
review/text: My wife loves this tea. I tried a cup and I like it too, even though I'm a coffee drinker.<br /><br />The problem is, 5 out of every 6 K-Cups we've used have split open and spread the ground-up tea all over the place. It takes the fun out of having this type of coffee/tea maker if you have to clean it after every cup.<br /><br />We've bought these before, from a different source, and didn't have this problem. We're hoping this was just a bad batch. At any rate, if you buy these, be aware that you may have many cleanups in your future.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because the tea itself is so good.

The tea basket is easy to use and the leftover tea comes right out either to put on the counter for later use or to dispose of in the wastebasket.

It reminds me of some of the premium brands in its color, texture, and....this is a bit gross, but the compactness & darker color of what came out of the dogs after they started eating it...!<br /><br />I like it, the dogs are eating it and doing well on it. I will definitely be buying it as their regular dog food from now on. The price is probably better than the other store premium brands because there is no advertising.<br /><br />I recommend it.

review/text: I learned today that this product and the previous bag I bought were recalled due to Salmonella. I just happened to stumble across the article on MSNBC. No notification was sent. Now the household's mysterious stomach flu isn't so mysterious. Also if you don't have your receipt they will only offer a coupon for replacement in 6 weeks.Why would I want another bag?!?

review/summary: nice variety available and multi-use....
review/text: I purchased 3 different "flavors"/varieties of this brand chiefly to use in my Solofil Cup for loose ground coffee in my Keurig K-cups coffee machine.<br />There are times that I like to have a STRONG coffee brewed for things other than consuming as a beverage....such as for making Tiramisu desert, flavoring in a homemade sugar syrup etc..<br />And, there are times I just like to have something different than what comes out of the little K-cups as a beverage for HOT and ICED Coffee alike. This type of item gives me the freedom of  control over that coffee strength.<br /><br />I found these packets convenient and of good quality.<br /><br />The canisters are nice...can reuse them for other things....they have a nice earthy feel/look to them.<br /><br />Yes, I do recommend the EkoJava Single Serve Coffee whether for the Solofil Cup or not.

review/summary: So-so coffee, too much sediment
review/text: I used this product in a Solofill cup on the ten oz setting on a Cuisinart SS700.  The first thing I noticed is that the packet doesn't tear open easily so I had to get the scissors.  A bit annoying.  Second, even though the coffee is sealed in the packet, there is no fresh coffee smell when I tear the packet open.  Third, the amount of coffee included just fits in the solofill cup.<br /><br />The next thing I noticed was that the brewed coffee did not flow as easily as it does with a K-cup so maybe the amount of coffee is actually too much.  It was a thin stream of coffee that threatened to stop flowing but did end up filling the cup,  although with no satisfying bit of foam at the top.<br /><br />Taste: typical restaurant coffee rather than coffeehouse coffee, that is, plain, uninteresting.  As one reviewer mentioned, muddy.  Sediment at the bottom of the cup.  The kind of coffee you swallow mindlessly with the breakfast special at the local greasy spoon.<br /><br />I only paid $7.50 and at this writing you can get Ekojava more cheaply than that, but I don't recommend it.  Splurge for a real k-cup or at least put freshly ground coffee into your Solofill.

review/summary: Very good coffee!
review/text: I have tried this and the French Roast from EkoJava so far. This one makes a delicious cup of coffee! Here is my review:<br /><br />1. It takes longer to brew a cup of coffee using this than a K-Cup. I'm not sure why it's so slow, but still much faster and more convenient than standard whole-pot brewing.<br />2. Yes, there is some clean-up involved. You have to clean out the filter between cups. I have no issues with this. I compost, and coffee grounds are great for compost. (I used to tear open the K-Cups and pour the grounds into the compost anyway.)<br /><br />To me, it is worth it. But it's not 5 stars because I'm not sure what is so "eco" about this EkoJava. Other than the obvious (no plastic cup), there is a still a foil pouch, and I don't see anything about where the coffee comes from. No mention of Fair Trade. Is the Eko thing just because it's a foil pouch instead of plastic cup? I'll take it I guess, but that's not huge win to me.

review/summary: it's OK
review/text: We decided to try these because they were on sale at a very low price. Though many reviews are positive, we weren't all that thrilled with them. It seems there is even just a bit too much in each packet for filling the holder. They aren't as convenient as some of the other reviewers might lead you to believe, and there is some stuff to throw away as well. The container they come in is quite large, so we ended up throwing them into a baggie. The flavor was pretty decent, but using them is really not all that different from using any other ground coffee.

review/text: OK, I am a long time K-cup user. I bought this coffee and the new fangled "Eco-Java" filter to see how it would work in my Keurig brewer.<br />I did not see any previous comments about the high level of sediment this coffee leaves at the bottom of the cup using the coffee brand's filter.<br />I also bought the Honduran coffee packets (same brand) and that coffee did not leave as much sediment as the West Coast Roast.<br />I'll hold out that maybe I got a defective item????<br />Bottom line, if sediment does not bother you, try this coffee.

review/summary: EkoJava ... not really ...
review/text: As an avid Keurig user I looked at the EkoJava offering as an opportunity to be environmentally sensitive and perhaps save a little money. Well cost per cup just isnt there. Loading their plastic holder from the plastic packages they supply is just a pain ... funny thing, the plastic pouches arent recyclable. The whole thing is, frankly, a mess ... I suppose it reduces waste to some degree, but it should be to a great degree for the cost. At minimum go to paper or recyclable pouches. The price point seems to be designed to provide about a 10 cent advantage, which just isnt enough ... especially since you need to drink 120 cups to work off the cost of the reusable container before saving anything ... it might be *IF* it was trully Eco friendly. I'll not be buying any more of these, I can buy a canister of coffee and get the same effect with any of the reloadable cups available and not only be ecologically sensitive but actually save a bundle to boot.

review/summary: WAS!!! convenient with good price
review/text: I purchased a few of these weeks ago at a price of $4.49 for a pack of 25. The french roast is very good. I use the ekobrew cup but, have had residuals left in my cup, I found if you tamp down the coffee after you fill it, it's not quite as bad. This coffee was a convenience with a good price but, I went to purchase more and they have gone from $4.49 to a so-called crossed out retail price, to an on sale price of $11.99 in a little over three weeks...Sale???? Made my last purchase until they get over their greedy period.. I can by a pound of fresh ground coffee my choice of grind and roast, for around $8.00 a pound and get three times as many cups of coffee for $3.99 less... Too bad...

I consider myself a coffee somelier of sorts and have experienced the taste of many coffees, prepared on at least five continents, and I'm telling you this: this Ecobrew West Coast Roast is some of the best coffee I've ever tasted. No, I don't work for Ecobrew but I'm sure glad I found them.  Now I hope they just keep the product reasonably priced. We'll see.

review/summary: Not so good
review/text: I purchased this product to try in the Ekobrew cup I bought to try to off set the cost of the kcups. Where do I start, first off the coffee is absolutely gross it smells like motor oil after its done brewing which takes for ever and tastes nothing like coffee. Just like another reviewer said it is so densely ground that it doesn't allow water to flow through it and there is definitely no fresh coffee small when you open the hard to open packets. I would suggest purchasing a different brand of coffee from your local market before trying these.

review/summary: Taste is fantastic, "single serve" package needs improvement.
review/text: The coffee is great.  Strong flavor, strong aroma. A very welcome taste any part of the day - especially morning/mid-morning. 4.5 stars out of 5 for the coffee itself.<br /><br />These are marketed along with the EkoBrew K-Cup replacement, which is how I have been using them.  The thing is - these "single serve packets" don't fit into the Ekobrew K-cup - there is too much coffee. There is no practical way to "save" the remaining grounds for use another time/day.  I don't drink the same flavor every day, so it would be a few days before I rotate back to this flavor, and then I'd have to open another package to even out the amount - leaving me with another partial package.  Unpractical to say the least.  I bought this to save time and flavor (after exposure to air, the flavor becomes less potent.) and I'm not really saving either.  I spend more time trying to tap out the proper amount of grinds to fit into the EkoBrew, and then the package is open, so the leftovers aren't as rich as the first brew. Package review would be 2 stars out of 5 - the functionality of it is there, but the sizing needs a major improvement to be practical for what it's marketed as.<br /><br />In summary: Taste is great, Package size leaves a lot to be desired.  3.5/5 total for the product - rounded to 4.

review/summary: Sweet
review/text: This pineapple is so sweet.  And it's so convenient to have the individual serving sizes.  I love pineapple so much that if I open a can, I'm likely to eat the whole thing.  Just make sure you tilt the container backwards so the air bubble is where you peel the film open ... and then open it slowly or the juice may squirt out.  The other option is to poke a hole with a knife first and then do the tilting thing (but be careful it doesn't leak out of the hole you made.)

review/text: I bought these recently as a Friday special for a great price.  These came quickly and I have one bag open and the others hidden so I don't eat them all.  These are huge bags and the candy is nice and fresh.  Wish the peanut butter ones would come in bags like these and sold thru Amazon, not another seller who charges shipping.  Thanks for the good sale on these.

review/summary: Good Cold Shipping by Amazon
review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

review/text: I ordered the 4 large bags. I received them in a timely manner and appreciated that they were shipped in a minimal amount of packaging. The four bags were simply shrink wrapped together and put in the box with my other items. I have only opened one bag so far but the M&M's were in great condition. Great price, delicious product, excellent service.<br /><br />Edit (10/01/10)- The price for these is now $35 more than when I bought them the first time. I can buy these for less than $10 a bag at the store. So the price is now closer to ridiculous then great.

I took these as a gift for a friend in Italy who hadn't been able to find them there.  I had to pull one out of my suitcase to get it back under the weight requirements and put it in my carryon, no problems with either.  My friend was delighted when they arrived and began snacking happily away immediately.

review/summary: **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************
review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

It's truly delicious and I would choose this over a non-gluten free cupcake because it tastes better.  Don't taste it when it first comes out of the oven. Wait till it is has cooled and you will the taste fabulous with or without frosting. I have tried other gluten free mixes and when it comes to chocolate, this is by far the best.

review/text: Well, it looks like Dagoba discontinued it's Prima Materia 100% cacaa bar, which was my favorite! Maybe, it was too strong for most people as a straight chocolate bar.<br /><br />However, I was thrilled to find this 100 percent "baking bar"... really it tastes the same as Prima Materia and unlike other baking bars there is no alkali added for processing (according to the packaging), so that means you get all the natural flavonoids and antioxidants in tact.<br /><br />So, for those of you looking for a substitute for Prima Materia... this is it...nice and astringent, strong and complexly flavored. I eat it right from the wrapper, but sometimes grate it over ice cream or in my tea.<br /><br />Will definitely purchase again.

review/summary: smooth, tasty chocolate with no sugar!
review/text: I'm delighted to find this organic 100% chocolate bar at Amazon since my local natural food store does not carry it & for some reason cannot special order for me. I have been eating 100% chocolate for several years now. Although this bar is a little thick for eating out-of-hand, overall it's quite nice & affordable as an every-day chocolate. Not the baking chocolate I remember from my childhood! Smooth, creamy, with a lovely mouth feel & finish. Would recommend to anyone looking to get their chocolate fix without the hazard of sugar. If you are weaning yourself from chocolate candy, I can recommend eating this half-and-half with a nice 75 or 80%  bar and gradually increasing the 100% as your tastebuds adjust. It's worth the effort!

review/text: This food looks and feels to be of good quality.  Also highly rated by [...] ([...]) and they place it in their top tier, so I had confidence going into the purchase.  It has really high quality ingredients such as turkey, chicken, turkey meal, chicken meal, potatoes, and herring meal, without fat in the first four ingredients, which apparently can lead to bloat.  I've been feeding my 60 pound Weimaraner this food for about two months and the bag still isn't gone.  My dog has been gaining weight over that time as well.  We have fed her Timberwolf Organics and Go! Natural Grain Free Endurance Formula before this and those were great as well.  With this food, we don't have to feed her as much, so this food is a very good value, cheaper overall than Timberwolf because of the reduced feeding.  However with this food and unlike the others, her stools have been small, hard, and consistent, which is very nice for me.<br /><br />I purchased from J-B Wholesale Pet Supplies which had very reasonable prices and shipping costs.  I bought three bags and the shipping was the same, so my shipping costs were around $1.50 per bag.  Two downsides were that shipping was slow and I didn't get a tracking number until I called J-B Wholesale.

review/summary: Great for our pup with allergies.
review/text: Our yellow lab has horrible food allergies and breaks out in staph infections within a day of eating something that doesn't agree with him.  He's had these issues since he changed off of his puppy food at about 8 months old. We tried nearly every recommended brand on the market till resorting to cooking for him about 16 months ago.  He's been totally fine on the home cooked food but it's a lot of work and I wanted to try finding a commercial food to supplement his home cooked meals.  So in our new, exhaustive effort to find a dry food we fortunately came across EVO.  It's still a bit early, he's only eaten it for 4 days but normally he would show reactions by now and he doesn't have any infections popping up so I feel great about it.  He does seem hungrier than usual following their feeding chart so that may need a little trial and effort for us but I'm thrilled if this continues to work.

review/text: For the price per kcal for grain free food this product was the best buy out there so I figured i would give it a try.  Then I found out that the infamous P&G purchased the brand so I decided to back away.  Ended up feeding one bag to my 3 year old weimeraner.  He devoured it of course, but there isn't a dogfood brand i've ever tried that he didn't devour.  His stools however became so rock hard that I could see the pain in his face each day as he was passing them.  I then switched to wellness core grain free at a slightly higher $ to kcal ratio but his stools are normal again and I feel comfortable that I won't be the chance victim of P&G's underhanded component tampering and come home to find my dog poisoned by an uncontrolled chinese byproduct they decided to substitute to increase profitability by .001%.
