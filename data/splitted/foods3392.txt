review/summary: Veterinarian review
review/text: I received a free sample of the Liv-a-Littles Healthsome dog biscuits with real chicken. This small biscuit, which you can see visible rolled oats in, prides itself on being oven-baked, with high-quality natural ingredients. Unfortunately, JP - my 11 year old picky pit bull - took it from my hand like a kid forced to swallow an oatmeal vitamin coated with vegetables. He eventually ate it, but it lacked the palability to please my dog.<br /><br />The ingredients include (in order): whole wheat flour, chicken, potato flour, pea flour, chicken liver, rolled oats, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), pumpkin, tomatoes, apples, sweet potatoes, cranberries, split peas, carrots, green beans, green bell pepper, celery, parsley, and ascorbic acid (a preservative - Vitamin C). While it has all the healthy veggies in it that your mom would be proud of, it failed the Lee palatability test. One paw down for palatability. Of course, if you own a Labrador retriever who'll eat anything, he'll like them, but they didn't pass JP's palate.

Well if you get 48 of these at a gas station or vending machine at 50 cents a piece than it cost about $5 less. You think you could get these at a cheaper price since you are buying them in bulk.

review/summary: Like fresh Onion flavor?
review/text: I use a lot of onion powder for seasoning many of my meat dishes.  It adds a certain zest to their flavor that I can't get any other way.  I also like to season my home made french fries with onion powder, a little fresh ground pepper and a little sea salt.<br />  This particular onion powder is one of the best I have found.  The company says it is packed fresh for each order, and I believe them.  You can tell it by the aroma of the product when you receive it.  I also like it because it is granulated and free flowing, much easier to control the right amount when applying it, and it does not cake up in the container when it sits for a while.  It is very economical, much cheaper than those small bottles of other products you get in the grocery store.<br />  In addition to this product, I plan to try several other products from this company.  I develop all of my own original recipes, and I want top quality seasonings and spices.<br /><br />  Trapper Tom<br />  Mahnomen, MN

review/summary: The Spice Of Life!
review/text: Every year I will make around 5gals of spaghetti sauce. After it cools, I'll put it in 1gal freezer bags and freeze it for quick easy meals. Without the Italian seasoning & the onion powder that I purchased, my sauce would be very hum-drum & bland. Checking other web sites I found that by far the best price for the spices is right here. Don't be fooled by other offers for "like" products. The onion powder is granulated not powdered dust. The Italian season is coarse and not bits & pieces of the "leftovers" that other companies package. Don't get me wrong, there are quite a few Spice Companies out there but right here is by far the best offer!<br />Happy Cooking!<br />Cheers!<br />Dave

review/text: I have ordered countless times from this company and I am in the process of placing another order.  I buy different variety of seasoning so I can make my own blend.  I just finished making several bottles of seasoning and rubs and I still have the scent on my hands even after washing my hands.  The seasoning is fresh and six months to a year later, the seasoning still holds the aroma and flavor of each seasoning and spice that I have ordered.  I have ordered this season in which I am reviewing as well as countless other seasoning and I am thoroughly happy with each of my orders.  Order a lot so the shipping balances out to nearly free.

review/text: I was really surprised when I looked online and saw that I only found positive reviews about these things!!!!  Quite frankly, I found the orange flavor weak, and it tasted just like the regular orange flavor, except worse.  I can't tell the difference between these and other orange candies, but they are a bit bitter, and again, the orange flavor is rather weak.  I'm not sure why others wrote positive reviews about them, since I am a bit of a candy nut.  I'm looking forward to reading other reviews.<br />I found these a poor value for the money, and the candy was MEDIOCRE at best.<br />Look elsewhere for orange candy!

Previous attempts were good enough but never approached the sublime nature of the Dancing Deer Chocolate Chunk Brownie. They are moist and chocolatey; the chunks merge into the rest of brownie. I am not a fan of hard chunks of chocolate in soft foods and I really could not detect chunks of chocolate. My affair with Dancing Deer's Caramel Sea Salt Squares is seriously compromised.

review/text: Great ingredients although, chicken should have been 1st rather than chicken broth, the only thing I do not think belongs in it is Canola oil. Canola or rapeseed is not someting a dog would ever find in nature and if it did find rapeseed in nature and eat it, it would poison them. Today's Food industries have convinced the masses that Canola oil is a safe and even better oil than olive or virgin coconut, facts though say otherwise. Until the late 70's it was poisonous until they figured out a way to fix that. I still like it but it could be better.

review/text: We have 3 poodles who needed to change from their low residue diets to something else.  Their liver counts were high and the vet recommend trying Wellness Duck and Sweet Potato.  After making the gradual change (take at least 10 days to completely change to a new dog food.  Start with 1 teaspoon a day for 3 days...then add a bit more until about day 10 when they can have their new food permanently.  If you change to a new food too fast the animal(s) will have (sometimes very severe) vomiting and diarrhea, so be patient and start small and slow).  Our little poodles liver counts are within normal range now and they LOVE this food.  They are excited about their meals now and everyone is happy.  We give it Paws Up.

review/text: After the high reviews on this product, I figured I should try it out... Maybe I had raised my hopes a little too high, because although this is does have a pretty good taste to it, I don't think it deserves quite 5 stars. You can really taste the apple flavor it in (a little sour), so if you like that flavor in your cereal, then you might like this product! I mixed this first with water, until the chia seeds became a goo-like substance - didn't like the taste of that that much. Then I just ate it on its own - that tastes great, actually! Eating it plain by the spoonful is a great snack. I haven't tried it with hemp milk or almond milk quite yet, but that might also be a great combination.

They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. There are 6 servings in every 2.6 ounce bag, with 29 calories in each serving. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />These particular chips are very sweet and taste especially delicious because of the added organic cinnamon. It actually is pretty hard to stop eating them!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Childhood favorite
review/text: Love this stuff!  I grew up in Michigan where it's sold everywhere.  This flavor (ruby red) is my favorite.  It adds an extra bit of tartness beyond that of the original flavor.  Even the diet version is good.  Doesn't taste anything like some of the other diet sodas on the market where the flavor of the aspartame overwhelms everything.  We always have family who still live in Michigan bring us several cases when they come to visit.  The taste of this soda in original flavor is comparable to that of Fresca, but less sweet. This is like Fresca with a healthy splash of ruby red grapefruit juice. A very clean, crisp tasting soda that is perfect for summer cookouts.

review/summary: A bucket of soy sauce.  What needs to be said?
review/text: This is a food-service portion of soy sauce.  The bucket itself is actually rather sturdy and you can probably find uses for it after you've emptied it.  That said, it's a bucket of soy sauce.  Kikkoman is a fine enough brand, and even with my use for marinating, stir frying, sauces, and yes, as a condiment for finished dishes, this is a lot of soy sauce.  The top has a little cap where you can siphon out small quantities without breaking the seal on the lid itself, and supposedly there's a spout or something built into it but I cannot locate this.  Presumably after you've exhausted the top half of your strategic soy sauce reserves you'll switch from using a baster or wine thief to a food-grade tube to extract the precious black fluid.<br /><br />I wouldn't bother buying such a thing at the same time, for even my level of use would have me reaching peak soy sauce sometime in 2019, finally cleaning the dregs in 2023.  If you're looking at all the bottles of soy sauce you go through, you'll finally meet your match here.  And then you'll have a nice bucket to bequeath to your grandkids, maybe they'll be the ones to finally polish it off.

Yes, he dropped the beef jerky stick that was in his mouth and went for this treat instead. The problem? He devoured it in approx 10 minutes, crumbs and all. For the price they are charging for these, I had hoped it would last longer! Other good news is that it did not discolor the carpet although I dont know if it would stain if it took longer to eat and he had to chew on it more. As much as he loves them, he wont be getting them very often because they are way too expensive to buy regularly for 10 minutes of chewing pleasure.

review/summary: Must Have!
review/text: When our local grocery store stopped carrying Dale's Steak Seasoning, we had to resort to having a friend in North Carolina bring cases of it when she came home once a year.  For a brief time it was available at our local Walmart, but even that was short lived.  Dale's Steak Seasoning is a must have in our house.  We give it as gifts but always keep several on hand.<br /><br />The great thing about this steak sauce is that it isn't just for steak.  I add it to white rice, hamburgers, chicken, and even spaghetti sauce.  The flavors are unique.  You can't quite put your finger on it, but a burger just isn't the same without it.  I always give it to my BBQ-happy friends, in the hopes they will use it the next time I come over.<br /><br />The only downside to this product is the sodium, but luckily, there is a reduced sodium version.  All in all, this is a great product and my house is never out of it.  We stockpile it, just in case...

If you are concerned about the ingredients they are listed here.  Not subtle but with some rib eye on the grill it does the trick.

review/summary: Incredible Dales!
review/text: Dales is a staple in the South. I live in the Northern Midwest and was floored by the flavor of this secret sauce. A little like Soy Sauce but better flavor. This is a terriffic marinade, flavor enhancer etc. Lots of recipes available on the web for use in all kinds of ways. I was gifted a bottle and bought a case. It's that good, really.

I have ordered the product direct from the Alabama location, and for the last fifteen years or so have been able to find it in some grocery stores.  I now live in the Harrisburg, PA area and have been unable to find it.  It's a product I don't like being without.<br />I use it for marinating steaks, chicken and other meats.  I use it to saute mushrooms.  I substitute it anytime a recipe calls for soy sauce.<br /><br />I rate this product five stars *****

review/text: I've been using Dale's since we discovered it when living in Alabama (near the Dale's Restaurant). It has always been available in supermarkets in northwest Indiana, so when we moved back in '96, we continued to enjoy it.  Suddenly, a couple months ago, it disappeared from all the markets in our area.  We tried other products, but none compared.  Thank Goodness we found we could order it online.  A burger or a steak on the grill just isn't delectable without Dale's.

review/text: It's been almost 15 years since I was introduced to Dale's marinade, and I still love the product. We mainly use it to marinade chicken before grilling (works great with dark meat: thighs). I've cooked the meat using different methods, but the best results come with grilling. There is a crispy caramelizing that's hard to get with baking or a George Foreman-type of press grill.

review/summary: Makes any meat or vegetable fantastic!
review/text: When I was a kid in Alabama, my dad used Dale's on everything he grilled from fish to wild game. He would tell his friends he could make shoe leather taste good with Dale's sauce. Some 30 years later we both continue to be Dale's sauce fans. For the folks that think it's salty, cut it with applejuice or beer and you'll get the flavor but not the typical saltiness of a soy-based product. Like grilled onions? Put some onions with a little Dale's in some aluminum foil on the grill while you're cooking. Like mushrooms on your steak? Put mushrooms, butter and Dale's in aluminum foil and do the same - awesome! Try grilling asparagus with it - I hated asparagus until I tried it with Dale's! I even make jerky using Dale's to marinate the meat beforehand. "Oh Boy" the cost savings!

It is particularly good on steaks, making them juicy and flavorful.  I am so happy to see it available online here, since it very hard to find in the stores in the northern part of the country.  The Dale's people were kind enough to send me a case before it was available online.  I told them I simply could not stand the thought of not having it again.  This stuff is absolutely delicious !!

I've ordered cases, given bottles to family and friends for father's day and housewarming gifts and found it a welcome friend in the kitchen and patio.  I add a dash to burgers & meatloaf, and a healthy dose to most marinades, or if time is tight, I sprinkle a bit on fresh steaks and chops as they hit the hot grill.  Man, I'm kind of hungry all of a sudden.  Get some Dale's, share it with friends.

review/text: I'm not quite sure why this got 5 stars by so many people, its not bad BUT its VERY salty, Dales says to let it marinade for 20 min or so (not longer) for best results, if I do that it over powers the meat. Ive tried it on burgers and only let it sit for 3 or 4 min, steak for maybe 5 minutes, Chicken for 5 minutes and ALL of them had a STRONG soy/salt taste.<br /><br />I ordered the 6 pack but was on back order so i found it locally for a few bucks so I picked up one bottle, I'm glad I did, I have since canceled my Amazon order. I am going to try different spices and techniques to see if it can be made to be as good as everyone says it is but DAMN!!!! its some potent stuff.

Marinate your steaks....for 30 minutes to an hour on the counter (don't use the fridge, the meat marinates better in room temperature).  Then throw the meat on a propane grill.  Mmmmmmmmmmmm the best steak I have ever had in my life.  I DEFINITELY recommend this product to ANYONE.  I buy it all the time in Florida where I am from, but I am now living in Texas and they don't sell it here.  So that is why I bought it online!  LOVE THIS STUFF!!!

review/text: Short and sweet:<br />My girlfriend sent me a bottle for Christmas. She lives in Alabama. I live in Maine. I'm not a 'health nut' and I love good steak sauce. This is not it !  The stuff tastes like Kikoman on steroids. It is so salty that I couldn't deal with it. The bottle says an avg serving has 1200 MG of salt (sodium). That is more than HALF THE DAILY ALLOWANCE for someone with no heart problems, cholesterol, yadda yadda. This stuff is HEART ATTACK IN A BOTTLE !  It also has a bunch of MSG. I am not concerned because I think the MSG scare is a bunch of hoopla from the moonbat lefties crowd. If you're a moonbat type, be advised.  My main complaint was the flavor. As I said it tastes JUST LIKE SOY SAUCE. Not my first choice to flavor a good steak. I would STRONGLY recommend A1 steak sauce or Worcestershire Sauce over this stuff ANY DAY. Also, McCormick has some EXCELLENT marinades that come dry in an envelope. Just add oil.  Sorry to dump on this stuff, but I am being as honest and objective as I can here.

review/text: I purchased two bags of these Wonderful Pistachios, and both of the bags I received were good.  So, I ordered them again.  The second time I ordered them, in each of the two bags I received, were so many either burned or rotted pistochios...about half of each bag had to be thrown away.  The last straw was when I cracked one that looked only mildly burned and discovered to my horror a WORM!  In addition to the worm was a lot of weird-looking, brown matter.  DISGUSTING!!!!  Needless to say, I found them far less than "wonderful" and will NOT be buyng them again.

review/summary: Wonderfully delicious and nutritious.
review/text: If you have not yet tried Wonderful Pistachios, what are you waiting for?  I used to be a cashew nut guy, but these pistachios changed that.  They are a bit pricier than the average pistachio nut, but believe me they are worth it.  There are very few rancid and hard to crack pistachios compared to other generic brands.  They are perfectly sweet and salty.  Also, there are important health benefits of eating pistachios.  According to Men's Health Magazine, they have been known to lower bad cholesterol (LDL) by an average of 13% with just 2 servings a day.  Of all nuts, Pistachios contain the most phytoserols, which act almost like a drug - they bind cholesterol in the GI tract and block its absorption.  As if these nuts weren't already wonderful enough with just their taste, they are wonderfully nutritious too.  Props to this company as well for wonderful advertising.

review/text: You really can't beat the price I got my 32 ounce bag for. I know at your local grocery they are normally around $5 for 8 ounces, but they do often go on a buy-one-get-one-free sale. If you like to eat these Pistachios regularly though and can't wait for sale this is a great price. The taste is good as well, and I have no complaints in that area. I will say that mine had no worms what-so-ever, and it is strange that such a creature would get into a package. More packaging on Wonderful's part I imagine, but I have know doubt that with my history with Amazon that they would be quick to fix any discrepancies. Overall, I give this five stars as it is one of the best pistachios deals I have seen and they are high quality pistachios as well.

Ate his entire bag before knowing it so I had to buy another bag for him. I was hooked on pistachios but it's so expensive. Unfortunately, I gave these a shot because they were on sale. 25% of these were duds and they don't taste as good as the seasoned ones. You have to bite into the duds to open the shell and that's just a pain. Sometimes paying a little extra is worth it. Will not buy again. Even their shell-less pistachios are bland.

review/summary: Good pistachios, but one bug in the product
review/text: For the most part, these are what you'd want in pistachios. They arrive fresh and tasty, for a little lower price than the local store.<br /><br />I'd estimate about 5-10% of the nuts are not opened, and get trashed. Another 10% get opened with some fingernail prying and pulling pretty hard.<br /><br />They're pretty salty, which isn't ideal, but right where I'd expect a normal salted pistachio, great for some who like salty and too much for others.<br /><br />However, there's one bug in the product - literally. I think two of the last three bage had one nut each where the nut had a bug - work, whatever it was - inside the shell.<br /><br />If you're on the couch munching watching tv, not looking at the nuts you open and eat, it'd be very easy to have eaten it. It's disgusting.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer, and they explained 'they try but it's not practical to avoid'. They're not the only brand - my last bag (and I mean last bag, over a year ago, didn't buy after) had the same thing.

review/summary: Great Product, Horrible Price
review/text: My cats love this stuff, and I've been waiting for it to become available on Amazon.  However, at $50 (plus shipping) for 24 of these things, that's over 2 times the per unit cost that local grocery stores charge and even more than what some other vendors are charging on Amazon.  I bought this direct from Amazon in March 2009 for $16.  What's the deal?

You only need to add water, so good to have in the pantry to make a quick dessert or morning breakfast.<br />the scones are light and the texture is crumbly.  I made them with cinnamon and raisins, next will do blueberries.<br />So easy, and each mix ( there are 4 mixes in the box) makes 8 to 10 scones.<br />Why buy these at 3 to 4 bucks a pop when you can have fresh from the oven with very little effort.<br />5 stars for me!!

review/text: Don't wait in line at the fair for scones, make them at home for a fraction of the price and much better results.  I am not a huge fan of mixes, but this one is worthwhile.  I substitute 1/2 & 1/2, buttermilk or cream for the liquid for a richer flakier scone. Add a tablespoon of sugar and it makes great shortcake too.  I often add things like dried fruit, nuts, poppy seeds or other flavor with great results.  For a quick savory scone I will add in pesto, grated cheese or crumbled bacon.  Fisher scone mix has been a staple in our house for many many years.

review/summary: Great Low Cal Gatorade Replacement
review/text: I've been using the powdered Gatorade mix for a while now for post workout and post wild night on the town recovery for a couple years now.  I haven't ever been able to find the Low Cal Gatorade in a powdered mix so I started looking elsewhere.<br /><br />The Propel Zero has been great! I usually mix up a Gallon at a time to I just put 6 packets / gal.  One packet is usually for 16.7 oz of water. Going by that there's 128oz in a gallon to get a perfect mixture you would want to use around 7.6 packets / Gallon of water.  I haven't had any problem mixing 6 packets / gallon; it's actually a little on the sweet side to me so anything more than 6 packs and it would probably be way to sweet.<br /><br />Using sex at a time leaves you with 6 gallons of goodness which is actually a good bit cheaper than the gatorade mix and less calories too!

review/summary: I really like Propel water
review/text: Propel zero packets<br /><br />I really like Propel water.  I used to keep a couple of bottles in the refrigerator, continuously.  These packets take less room and are cheaper than the bottles.<br />My only problem is with the pre-cut strip at the top of the tube.  When I used it the opening is not wide enough for the powder to come through.  No problem, I just cut the top off the tube with scissors about a quarter inch below the strip.  I needed a heat exhaustion remedy recently.  My brother suggested <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025WGHEE">Gatorade G Series Lemon-Lime (76.5 oz/Makes 9 Gallons)</a>.  I used these instead and bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015C2ZI2">Now Foods Potassium Gluconate Pure Powder, 1-pound</a>to supplement the Propel Zero, it's a lot cheaper.  Propel had everything I needed except for Potassium, problem solved!  I use old 2-liter bottles to mix this in.  Four tubes per two liters seem to work! One tube per 17 fluid ounces<br /><br />I highly recommended Propel Zero for anybody looking for a low calorie good tasting drink!<br /><br />Gunner, July, 2012

We hoped it would be half as decent as people reported, but I must say we were happily surprised at how good these beans actually are. The espresso we brew (using an old-fashioned stove-top espresso maker) has a rich, flavorful aroma and taste. I will not attempt to describe it - you have to try it yourself - other than by saying that this has become our espresso coffee for as long as the beans are available. Oh, and it is a fair trade coffee, which seems to me like be a wonderful way to explain why it is so good!

review/summary: The BEST coffee for you AND the Planet!
review/text: I love coffee! But I love really GOOD coffee...and I found a great coffee bean that is not only excellent tasting, but also environmentally friendly! Caffe Appassionato Organic Shade Grown Espresso Roast Whole Bean Coffee is by far my favorite coffee! I have been buying organic, fair-trade and shade-grown coffee beans for a while, but wanted to find something a little less expensive -  when I found Caffe Appassionato on Amazon, I thought I'd try it since it was only about $20 for 3 - 12oz bags. I have a basic expresso/cappuccino maker and a good bean grinder and made this coffee one morning and was very impressed! These beans produce a very rich, dark and smooth expresso with a strong but not too bitter taste. This coffee really wakes me up in the morning! I love it much more than the expensive top-chain coffee houses and I know that it is also Fair traded, certified organic by OCIA (Organic Crop Improvement Association International) and shade grown to protect migratory bird populations.<br /><br />Why are shade grown coffee beans better for the environment? Well, we all know how popular coffee is to drink, but the beans are mostly grown in tropical, rainforest locations with sensitive eco-habitats. Some newer varieties of coffee require direct sunlight (and chemicals) to grow to optimum production levels, thus requiring trees and other vegetation to be removed from plantations, destroying the natural habitats. But the traditional varieties of coffee plants actually require the canopy of trees to filter sunlight. Since about 1996, the destruction of natural habitats, primarily of migratory birds, has sparked the movement towards going back to shade grown coffee plantations and more sustainable practices. Thankfully, companies such as Caffe Appassionato take pride in providing high quality, sustainably produced, organic coffee and the trend is growing.<br /><br />To get this coffee at a better price than I have seen anywhere don't forget to sign up for subscribe and save to save an additional 15%!!
