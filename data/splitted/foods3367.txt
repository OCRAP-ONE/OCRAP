review/summary: Best yellow curry paste!
review/text: I have just begun my endeavors in making yellow coconut curry and thus have been trying numerous curry powders and pastes. By far this is the best I have tasted and has surpassed the flavors in my favorite Thai restaurants. I purchased just one of these containers and went through it in under a month (constantly making curry). Because of this, I ordered the 3 pack and am pleased. The shelf life is about a year for the containers (after opening refrigerate) so it fit my need. The packaging is interesting because it is in the container is similar as shown (I have added a picture of what it looks like) but the curry is in an internal plastic bag as well. The instructions on the container are good but have some measurements in grams. The only thing I would do differently if fry the paste before adding anything. This really unlocks the flavor of the curry! From my experience I add about the amount of curry desired to a frying pan then add oil until the curry paste stop absorbing it. Let it fry, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes on medium heat (don't burn the paste) until it turns a deeper brown then add coconut milk and other ingredients as desired.

review/summary: YELLOW ,  THE COLOR OF SUNSHINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: This is my first for adventure into yellow curry paste, and I love it.  Even though it is not as hot as some of the other curry's, the level of spice and flavor does not disappoint.  I followed the recipe on the side of the container.  It does use the European scale of measurement that at first was a little intimidating.  I did notice under "nutrition", that it it listed 2 teaspoons is 10 GRAMS.  That means that 50 grams is 10 teaspoons.  There is no law that says you can't use more.  I intend to hit the net for more recipes, plus i have some of my own ideas, HEY,FAKE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.  The flavor profiles in this yellow curry allows you to take an all expenses paid, TRIP THROUGH YOUR OWN IMAGINATION.

review/summary: Loved it !
review/text: I loved this brand of raisins because it has a natural fruit taste. Sun maid raisins is hard and taste like it has sugar with a gritty feel. These are soft and moist. I bake alot with these, but mostly enjoyed by the handfuls out of the box. My grandchildren love them. Will be ordering more. I'm glad I found these on amazon, never heard of this brand.

review/summary: Try it!
review/text: I couldn't disagree more with the negative review this has been given. I thought it was very good! It does have a bit of a different taste, slightly like molasses, I thought; but the peanut flavor is there. I didn't find it to be runny at all. Maybe the earlier reviewer hadn't refrigerated it. (It must be refrigerated after opening as there are no added preservatives.) I have stayed away from PB for years because of the fat content and calories- now I can have it again! (And, no, I don't work for the company, either!) I find it to be very satisfying even without the extra calories and fat. So I would urge others to judge for themselves. If you need to limit your calorie and fat intake you just might want to give this a shot. I'm sure glad I did!

review/summary: Peanut Butter Cups Without the Chocolate
review/text: This is an alternative to peanut butter for people on restricted diets or just plain watching calories.  It is sweeter than peanut butter, much like the peanut butter in Peanut Butter cups.  I found it satisfactory as an ingredient swap for peanut butter.<br />I purchased this right from the company and was pleased with the turnaround time.

review/text: I can't eat this on its own, because I can't get past the fact that it's not real peanut butter. (I also don't like other food substitutes, like soy milk, tofu, etc.) I love peanut butter. But if you eat Better'n Peanut Butter with a lot of jam or jelly, then it tastes pretty much like a normal PB&J. I still prefer the real thing though...but this is OK since I'm trying to cut down on fat content. I just wish it weren't so sweet.

review/summary: Convenient packaging
review/text: Although we make most of our baby's food at home, we like the Plum Organics for meals on the go.  The packaging is great because you don't need a bowl -- you can just squeeze the food directly into a spoon.  The package will reseal and you can use it again since your baby's saliva never contacted the unused food.  My son seems to like this flavor (although he isn't very picky), and the ingredients are simple, so I still know what I'm feeding my baby.

review/text: We have been using these for our son for over a year now. It seems recently that the quality has gone down hill. These feel a bit too watery now. I've tried a few batches from local store to compare if this was a one time thing. Looks like they all are the same watery kind now. I've compared this to other flavors, and seems like this is the only flavor that has this problem. All other flavors are still the same good quality.<br /><br />Manufacturer : Please don't try and fix something that's not broken.

review/text: I love the convenience of this product. And the quality is great.  However the reason it's less expensive than other pouches is that it is thinned out with water.  It's fine, but if my daughter gets ahold of it, it runs everywhere.  I prefer Ella's product over this even though it's a lot more expensive.

review/text: I got this for my 10 month old baby. She doesn't know how to hold the pouch and suck out the food herself so I squeeze some in a spoon and feed her by hand. Sometimes I squeeze a little in her mouth to get her used to eating it that way too. Plus this way there's no bowl for her to grab! She absolutely loves the flavor. Sometimes I squeeze some in a bowl and mix it with yogurt and feed it to her with a spoon. She loves that too. Can't wait to try the other flavors.<br /><br />It's definitely easier to store these in a baby bag once they're open--I haven't had any spills with this, unlike other baby food jars.

review/summary: Our toddler LOVES Plum!
review/text: I could spend a lot of time writing a very glowing review for all the Plum puree products, but I will simply say our 13mo old has been sucking on these things since 7mo and he loves them. Whenever solid food fails, he will always happily eat a Plum puree. We have tried all the flavors, and this is one of his favorites. Great for also mixing into plain yogurt or plain oatmeal for a little flavor. Also great for tossing into the diaper bag for a quick on the go snack. Amazon's great pricing on these makes it a no brainer to stock up.

review/summary: I wanted to love these...
review/text: I make my baby's food and only use organic ingredients.  We buy most of our produce from local farmers so winter selections can get a bit limited.  I decided to try these because the only ingredient is organic peaches and I was SO excited to find them because peaches are one of my absolute favorites and packaged organic ones have been really hard for me to find, so I was even more excited to find them already handily pureed and packaged into baby food.<br /><br />I got them ready for my daughter and immediately noticed that instead of an orange-y color, they were dull and brownish.  My daughter still seemed excited to try them though, but then she made a horrible face and actually shuddered.  I tried a second spoonful in case she just needed a minute to get used to the flavor, but my normally adventurous eater (who begs for things like edamame and feta cheese) refused to take it.  The only other thing she has rejected that way were jarred baby food green beans (but she likes steamed/pureed green beans).  And then I tried it (and wished I had tasted it first to begin with) and they were just awful.  To me they only tasted vaguely like peaches - bland, slightly sour, and even a slight bitter aftertaste.  I've never had any fresh, canned or frozen peaches that have tasted like that before and I'm particularly sorry that I got a case before trying just one.  Ah well, live & learn and come summer I'll be able to feed her the real thing.  The use by date was over a year away and the seal wasn't compromised (and we tried another pouch just to be sure it wasn't a fluke one) so I don't think it was a product freshness issue.

review/summary: Good flavor, big solid leaves
review/text: Have purchased Two Leaves and a Bud tea many times over the years and have to say that the peppermint is, by far, my favorite. The mint is clean and refreshing and the tea is high quality. The tea bags are made of a fine mesh and the leaves are large cut and release very little dust that can ruin the end of a cup. I prefer to drink my tea after steeping for 2-3 minutes (don't like it overly strong myself) and find I can usually get a decent second cup from 1 tea bag. It is one of my favorite peppermint teas though I have knocked off one star for the high price and the fact that the mesh tea bags occasionally rip if you're not careful when pulling the tag off.

review/summary: Bold Flavor
review/text: This is the K-Cup I go to when I want a nice, bold coffee.  Not too strong and not too bitter, this coffee hits the spot! Wonderful on its own, but this is a great dessert coffee as well! Stands up well to the medium Keurig setting and might work on the large setting for those who prefer a little weaker cup.

review/summary: My new fave!
review/text: Have pretty much tried all of the K-cup varieties available since getting our first Keurig machine about a year ago (we now have one in our weekend home as well) and this is my personal favorite - makes a nice bold cup of great-tasting coffee (particularly if you "double brew") that's now my first thing in the morning everyday brew! Might be a bit strong for some but great for those who like their coffee a bit stronger.

review/text: This is simply the best coffee k-cup.  A little known fact about coffee is that the longer it is brewed the more bitter the taste.  To get a mild cup of coffee you should actually use a stronger roast, use less water and add hot water to the completed beverage.  This coffee makes the smoothest and best tasting cup I think I have ever had from a home coffee machine.

review/summary: K-cups are defective
review/text: I have owned a Keurig brewer for over 2 years and have never had a problem with any K-cups. I had previously purchased these K-cups as part of the Subscrible and Save program and had been happy.  The last order I received has been a disaster, either the filter piece is missing from the K-cup or the K-cup is not sealed properly.  Amazon customer service was excellent as usual and replaced the order, but I am having the same problem with the replacement cups.  I know it is not my brewer because I have other K-cups that work just fine.  It is very messy when the coffee grounds either explode all over the place or end up in the cup.  It is extremely aggravating to go through 10+ K-cups to get one cup of coffee.  Again, this is not the fault of Amazon, but rather the manufacturer of these K-cups.  I will be canceling this Subscribe and Save plan.

review/text: I have had a K-cup machine at work for a year or two; and one at home for over a month; I am an addict for strong coffee/ we have a club at work (not k-cup related) and we get PEETS' coffee/ its really bold and rich.<br /><br />I have had most every extra-bold roast for the K-cup machine. In my opinion, the Black tiger is a great tangy bold coffee with enough earthiness too but nicely powerful and flavorful. A great combination. A double dose of this in the travel mug and its heaven. If you are like me and like dark coffee that actually still has flavor... You will really love this one.

review/text: I have only seen one Keurig brewer here in Japan. Don't those little plastic packages generate an awful lot of non-degradable waste? Do we really need more, especially for the sake of saving a few seconds making morning coffee???

review/text: Bought this for my husband, it's his new favorite. He likes a really dark 11 oz. cup of coffee so I always get Extra Bold varieties for him. Some of his other favorites are Green Mountain's Dark Magic, Timothy's Midnight Magic & Rainforest Espresso.

review/summary: This is it!
review/text: If you like your coffee strong this is the K-Cup for you!  I've tried the 'bold' coffees from various manufacturers here on Amazon and this is the one that wins hands down.  It's strong, it has a kick but the flavor is still smooth and subtle.

review/summary: Coffee People pods are the best
review/text: Black Tiger is my favorite coffee pod. First, it is delicious coffee. Second coffee people pods are the only pods I have seen where you get some crema, or the creamy looking froth that high pressure brewing can get. This is the sign of a well brewed cup and something that drip cannot duplicate. I used to mix up my pods but after trying the Black Tiger I have 4-5 boxes and unused pods that will never be used. The other Coffee People pods also get some crema.

review/summary: Just what I was looking for.
review/text: To begin, disregard the low ratings for this item given by other reviewers. 1: they are not reflective of the coffee as a product, and 2: the issue was obviously a market-wide increase in price as I cannot find any site or retailer that sells them for the prices they claim.<br /><br />As far as the coffee, I am very pleased with it. I can be very picky with my coffee and took a gamble by ordering this specifically instead of a variety pack, luckily I was not disappointed. It tastes distinctly of coffee without being harsh, even when there is plenty of cream and sugar. A common problem I have with stronger coffees is an acidic aftertaste that persists unless I eat something or try to wash it down, but  I have not had any issues with this and I am nearly through my first pack.<br /><br />I can't speak for other blends from Coffee People, but I honestly can't see myself wanting to. Black Tiger is absolutely delicious and just what I like in the morning or when I come home from work. Very satisfied.

review/summary: Great Cup of Coffee!
review/text: This is definetly a keeper in my pantry.  I tried the Donut Shop and the Black Tiger and by far everyone prefers Black Tiger. Donut Shop tastes, well like a cup of coffee from a Dinner, or McDonalds. But Black Tiger has a strong taste without any of the bitter undertones.

review/summary: Best K-Cup I have tried...
review/text: The Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast is by far the best K-Cup I have tried.  I have had my Keurig brewer for about a year now and I have bounced around from brand to brand sampling the different coffees to find one that really speaks to me.  The Black Tiger may be that coffee.  I like a strong cup of coffee, but I don't want it to be bitter or taste burned.  The Black Tiger has no bitterness or over-roasted taste to it.  It is very smooth and full bodied.  I have also tried the Timothy's Rainforest Espresso and this coffee is far superior in texture, body, flavor, and strength.  I keep 3-4 different types of K-Cups near my brewer and ever since I bought the Black Tiger it is the only coffee I have drank!

review/summary: Not bad, but we like Timothy's Midnight Magic and Green Mtn Dark Magic better!
review/text: Not bad, but we like Timothy's Midnight Magic and Green Mtn Dark Magic better! Please read my review under Timothy's Midnight Magic for in-depth comparison. Overall, not a bad cup, bitter smell, not as bold as the others listed above. In fact, I prefer the Diedrichs French Roast over it as well.<br /><br />#1 Timothy's Midnight Magic  (see review)<br />#2 Green Mtn Dark Magic  (Target)<br />#3 Diedrichs French Roast<br /><br />A lot of people seem to really love the Black Tiger based on the reviews, I have them sitting on the counter, but once my friends try the Midnight Magic from Timothy's, they never try anything else. Just my limited experience. :)

review/text: I have not tried an Extra Bold Coffee that I did not like. Having said that, I find the Coffee Peoples Black Tiger Extra Bold to be very good. I normally drink this product after dinner. The name is a little intimidating but overall a goood cup of coffee. I like strong fresh coffee, however I find my guest like something milder than Bold coffee.

review/summary: Great Everday Stong Coffee
review/text: I enjoy this flavor of coffee everyday at work.  This was the alternative I chose to Dark Magic, which is also a good brew.  Often many coffee flavors tend to taste different over time, usually more acidic than I would care for.  But this is a good rich, dark coffee that you can order for a long time.

review/text: OK, here's the thing, I love my Keurig coffee maker.  Finding a good deal on K-Cups is another issue alltogether.  Coffee People's Black Tiger Bold is a good value and a great cup of coffee for those who like a strong, rich, dark roast.  Thanks, Amazon.  Now, if you would please get rid of shipping charges on coffee orders of $50 or more, I'd order more often.  Anyway, get this coffee.  You'll love it.

review/summary: Excellent, best of the best!
review/text: After being a Starbucks drinker for the past 20 years at least, the Kcup has won me over, especially Green Mountain coffees and blends like Black Tiger.  None of this coffee is ever bitter or acidic like Starbucks.  It's strong but as it's perfectly measured you never get that "put too much coffee or too little water" feeling.  It was interesting to see a CNBC special on Green Mountain, which also makes the Keurig brewers; they said the makers are sold literally at cost and they make their money off of the coffee.  Starbucks is now selling Kcups...for over a buck each!!  I say drop the Star and save some Bucks!

review/text: Coffee People K-Cup Extra Bold Black Tiger Roast is an exceptionally robust, bold flavor without even approaching bittnerness.  And, it avoids the 'greasy' richness of some other brands, which for me at least, can cause a queasy stomach.  This is my favorite!

review/summary: poor packaging
review/text: I received a 25-count box of Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast that had 3 packets with unsealed tops. In fairness, I don't know if this was the result of poor quality control in production or damage during shipping. My order included a box of Gloria Jeans K-cups which did not have opened tops so I suspect that the tops on the Coffee Peoples cups were not glued properly.<br /><br />One day after voicing my concern, I received a replacement. What great service - I'd give them 5 stars now!
