review/summary: Acquired taste
review/text: I am an avid coffee drinker and have tried many different types of coffee. I had Turkish coffee many times except my friend always ground her own and I liked the flavor of her coffee. I was grinding my own coffee and preferred the taste over this Turkish  coffee. While this coffee is ground to perfection and was not expired ( it actually has another year and a half) as well as packaged in a great canister that easily fits in the refrigerator , My taste buds are not adjusting to the flavor. Mehmet Efendi Turkish Coffee has a very earthy almost topsoil earthy flavor. Not that I've tasted topsoil but the smell of topsoil is how this coffee tastes to me. That's about as good as I can explain it. Like I stated earlier it is an acquired taste and I am in no way stating it is terrible coffee but before you purchase this consider buying your own favorite coffee bean and grinding it to a fine powder. I use the magic bullet to grind my coffee beans and it works great.

review/text: These baby carrots are the real thing, not big carrots whittled down like I see in grocery stores all the time.  They are tasty and bright orange about two inches long and a half inch in diameter.<br /><br />However, I give them only four stars because they are overcooked to the point of being mushy and fall apart when heated to a brief boil.  They are also too soft to use in a hot veggie salad.  That said, Libby's canned veggies, including these carrots, are a terrific online value.

review/summary: Pretty Good Stuff
review/text: I believe that grains are not good for cats and so decided to eliminate dry food from my cat's diet.  In reading the labels of canned cat foods I noticed that most have wheat gluten in them, a substance that is not only from grain but a major allergen for many people and pets.  It's not a healthy or wholesome substance.  After a bit of research I found that with Fancy Feast, if you stick to the "classic" or original recipes (generally of a pate consistency) there is no wheat gluten.  Any recipe that has an extra descriptive such as grilled, flaked, shredded, etc. has the gluten so I'm thinking it must be the gravy that requires wheat gluten.  Anyway, my cat has two issues - she is overweight and has a tendency for diarrhea.  I'm on a mission now to figure out how to deal with both.  I think seafood is the main cause of her diarrhea episodes and I'm betting grains are contributing to her weight problem.  Mainly I'm letting people know by writing this review that this particular collection of Fancy Feast does not have wheat gluten in it.  And even though it does have animal by-products at least they are not right up at the top of the list of ingredients.  I've gone through trying all the expensive specialty foods only to see them summarily rejected one after another and I know my cat likes Fancy Feast so I feel like we have found a happy medium.  Update - since writing this review I have figured out that wheat gluten was causing my cat's messy poops and obesity and seafood was causing the skin eruptions.  I've experimented enough to know this for certain.  So she's eating nothing but chicken, even her treats are freeze dried chicken breast.  the three foods she gets are the Wellness chicken and turkey in pouches, Weruva shredded chicken breast, and Natural Balance chicken and chicken liver.  None have by-products, gluten, or seafood, and none of them smell bad.  My cat is as clean as it gets "back there" and she's trim and silky.  I know she has got to be enjoying her greatly improved condition even more than I am.

review/summary: Great nutrition for a great price!
review/text: I recently had to switch to canned foods because one of my cats was diagnosed with diabetes.  This has the right nutrition for kitties, none of that gluten or ridiculous amounts of byproducts and carbs which cats don't need like you find in dry cat food or poor quality canned foods.  Now both my cats look healthier, and their coats are smoother and shiner, and they shed less!<br /><br />There is nowhere you can find it any cheaper than on Amazon. I've checked at Target, Walmart, Petco, Wegmans, etc, and the cheapest so far is 0.50 per can (when it is on sale at Walmart).  By subscribing to regular deliveries on Amazon, I can get it delivered to my doorstep for 0.48 per can.  It really adds up especially if you have multiple cats!  Thanks Amazon.. I would not be able to feed my kitty without you.  &lt;3<br /><br />Update: By the way, in case this helps anyone.. My kitty went into diabetic remission and does not need insulin anymore after 1.5 months of eating FF. ;)

review/summary: My Cat is Now Insulin Free
review/text: My cat became very ill so I brought him to the vet.  He was diagnosed with diabetes.  He was so sick that we were not sure that he would survive.  I began giving him insulin shots every day twice a day and the vet told me to take him off his dry food immediately.  I was feeding him Blue Wilderness and a few other "High End" dry foods.<br /><br />The doc told me to give him Fancy Feast Classics - Only the ones that were Wheat Gluten free (not all fancy feasts are).  I was a bit surprised that I was being told to feed him food that can be purchased in the grocery store after I had spent years spending a fortune on high end specialty foods.<br /><br />Anyway - to make a long story short, after 4 weeks of diet change, my 13 year old cat is now in remission!  He has not had insulin shots in 3 weeks.<br /><br />I highly recommend any Fancy Feast "Classics" only with NO Wheat Gluton (and try not to give fish more than once per week due to Mercury levels)!<br /><br />I like ordering it online for convenience and I subscribe to it on amazon so that I automatically gets shipped to my house each month.

review/summary: Feast!
review/text: Fancy Feast really has only two ingredients that worry me.  One is the meat by-products, the other is the sodium nitrate.<br /><br />The by products are the fourth and sixth heaviest ingredients by weight- I consider that pretty good considering that instead of by-products, my pets could be eating some useless carbohydrate that could have made the second or third ingredient even in a great cat food.  The sodium nitrate is worrisome since it's been proven to cause seizures in lab animals- but I have picky cats.<br /><br />They wont eat the wellness core, so what is a girl to feed?  I just opt for Fancy Feast.  The price is good, and the ingredients are totally better than any dry food so they're ahead of the herd in that regard.  Plus, the cats eat it like there is absolutely NO TOMORROW.<br /><br />I can get these variety packs locally for a little under 11 dollars so I would shop around and see if you too have a gem of a grocery store, but outside of that, the Amazon Subscribe and Save seems a great option.

review/text: The day I made a mistake and started feeding her you'd think was a Fancy Feast addict and would start jonesing for her Fancy Feast dinner fix.  She knows somehow when it is time and becomes insufferable until I open the can.  Then she starts meowing like crazy as if she were starving her.<br />She has thrived on this stuff.  Her coat is very soft and shiny and she is very frisky for an older cat.  In cat years she is middle aged.<br />I may have to start buying in bulk to save money right now I subscribe to 3 different ones over a three month period but will be adding one soon for variety.  I figured it out and if you subscribe it is cheaper than Sam's club warehouse.

review/summary: SAVED CATS LIFE
review/text: Several years ago(2006) my first ever cat was doing very poorly, very low weight and not eating properly.  She was down to just eating the gravy of packaged cat food.  I went to the pet food store, a national chain, and looked for the Most Expensive cat food.  At that time, Fancy Feast was selling at 74 cents per can which was fairly costly for just 3 oz.  Soon as I opened the can the cat fell in love with this brand.  Our other three cats seem to like it too.  The old cat, 18 years young, has gained the right amount of weight, is healthier and robust AND...BETTER news...the price of the product went DOWN to around 54 cents per 3 oz can.  The old girl and I may see a few more sunrises after all.  I like the subscription and the convenience of it being delivered to my doorstep too. (2012)

review/text: Fed my diabetic cat this food because it was listed on Binky's list which lists nutritional data (not available on the cat, but by calling the manufacturers)for owners of diabetic cats.  He thrived on it.  Regained his normal weight, shined up his dull and falling-out fur, regained his normal gait (I did add methylcobalamin or vitamin B12 to help with the diabetic neuropathy in his back legs in addition to giving insulin twice a day).  Now all the cats love it, and I love the 3 ounce can.  It is amazing how little a hungry cat will actually eat at a time and sometimes my three cats will be "starving" and not even eat 1 ounce each.  Very little waste with the 3 ounce can.  Gluten free was a bonus.  Love the price and the home delivery (Prime for me) is fantastic.

review/text: My cat was diagnosed with feline diabetes and put on insulin injections twice a day. The vet tried to sell us perscription cat food that was very expensive. When I researched it online, TONS of people said that simply feeding their cats Fancy Feast (classic variety) cured their cat's feline diabetes.  Sure enough, after only 1 month on Fancy Feast (plus injections), my cat was able to stop the injections and only continue his special diet of Fancy Feast.  He eats only Fancy Feast now is no longer dependent on the insulin!!! That was easy!

review/text: I have no idea why my cat vomits this food up, maybe it's too fatty - not sure. It also left pink stains on the carpeting.<br /><br />In any case, I switched him over to Nutro canned, Solid Gold and Solstice. He has had no problems since.

review/summary: old kitty chow
review/text: Do you have an elderly kitty who has trouble keeping weight on? For some reason they find this stuff very appetizing, they never get sick of it and the small size means less to throw out when they are done nibbling at it. My vet has said other clients have this experience with their old cats and Fancy Feast. So if you have an old silver bear with early kidney failure or IBD this might not be the best diet for them medically but they will eat it even when other foods don't interest them.

review/summary: Great stuff, price pretty good!
review/text: I normally buy this loaf pack at my local store that starts with a t at pretty close to this same price.  This makes them .50 a can, which is about average for Fancy Feast.  This is the ground variety, in case you're wondering.  Thought I'd let you know since I didn't see that in the listing.  I have one cat that will eat ground, and one that won't.  Usually the males LOVE their meat so they won't touch ground, but the females will.  They particularly love the chicken in this pack, with turkey running a close second.  Beef I only feed them once a week or so - not their favorite but they'll choke it down.  Great buy, love the free shipping too.  Highly recommend!

review/text: My older cat who has always eaten dry food suddenly stopped eating.  I've been trying different brands and styles (slices, chunks, pates) and this seems to be the easiest for her to eat. But the smell in the litter box is enough to drive me out of the house! While this is helping to keep her weight on I have to keep searching for something with more greens and grains, apparently those things can help keep the odor down.

review/summary: Our Six cats eat this voraciously!  It's a real treat for them
review/text: We have six cats that are leaning toward the senior side at 7 years and up.  All of them are ferals and rescues and one in particular is asthmatic and deals with urinary infections.  He is a high strung kitty.  Because of this, we have fed all of our cats the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050JL47E">Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Feline Urinary SO Morsels in Gravy Canned Cat Food 24/3 oz Cans</a> in both the wet and dry forms. This is expensive but also seems to be a little rough on some of their stomachs.  Over the years I have always fed our cats a combination of Wellness <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J8J4UY">Wellness Dry Cat Food for Adult Cats, Indoor Health Recipe, 11-Pound and 8-Ounce Bag</a> and Natural Balance <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CFN2Y">Natural Balance Canned Cat Food, Indoor Formula, 24 x 6 Ounce Pack</a>.  There have been various levels of finicky-ness and various levels of tolerance among out cats with one or another vomiting because something did not agree with them.  I've tried organic and more expensive foods ... but there is always a puker in the bunch or one who will not tolerate it or eat it.<br /><br />So I tried an experiment ... one of our kitties was having a difficult time gaining weight so I decided to try a few cans of Fancy Feast Classic.  Lo and behold ALL 6 cats now LOVE THE STUFF and I have to feed them all 3 times a day along with keeping the Royal Canin Urinary dry food out for them to help with urinary issues.  For me, it was never a cost thing ... I just didn't ever believe that a mainline food like Fancy Feast would have any appeal to our cats and be as gentle on their stomachs as it has been.  I also thought that because it was a cheaper food it would create a very stinky litterbox.  Well, not so.  To my surprise all the cats have loved the stuff and have not struggled with stomach or bowel issues.  The litterbox is no fuller than usual and no smellier.<br /><br />It's a cheap food ... and I've never given our kitties cheap food ... but I am not going to argue with success and the fact that our kitties lick their plates clean and can hold the Fancy Feast down without vomiting.  With six kitties, it seems there is always one that struggles with some type of intolerance.  Not so with this food.  There coats are soft and there eyes are clear.  I call it success.<br /><br />Amen to that.  5 stars.

review/summary: my Mocha likes this esp chicken one
review/text: I have a lovely snowshoe siamese named Mocha and she loves this. she isnt a big eater....as in she likes to eat little bits here and there with all types of food offered to her. I feed about 1/3 a can of this and sometimes mix in fresh cooked meat or fresh green vegetables for her nightly meal. i do want her eating fresh food as i believe any processed food isnt good for anyone--man or animal. Mocha isnt a fan of fresh food, unfortunately...and loves dry cat kibble which isnt the best for cats. :(<br /><br />Anyway, as stinky as this classic fancy feast is, she seems to like it. she will either devour the whole serving i give her or will eat a bit at a time until it's all gone in the AM.  Of all the classic fancy feast flavors, my Mocha loves the chicken one.  i notice she will devour it in one setting and give me 'i want more' look afterwards.  LOL<br /><br />Of all fancy feast foods, these classic types are the 'better' ones if your cat is diabetic (do google search) as this has more protein (13% crude protein) compared to grilled version. I havent tried those tuscany, mediteranean newer ones yet though.<br /><br />i myself do subscribe and save (SS) cause i save so much more this way.  i notice in grocery stores, the sale price for fancy feast is usually around $10 excluding tax. So doing the math, SS saves alot of money.  I also do an online reward program that allows me to get $25 in monthly amazon gift cards for free so really, i get this for free. yay! thanks amazon AND to my fav. rewards program.  =)

review/text: I am not sure how to review cat food.  I myself have never tasted it, not even by accident.  My Vet told me that tarter problems with my cat's teeth would be less with wet food than dry food.  So, with that advice in mind, I signed up for a Amazon subscription and have a box of this Fancy Feast shipped once per month.  It is so cool to come home and find the new monthly delivery of cat food at my front door.  It is truly worry free, trouble free shopping.  Kuddos to Amazon.com for making it easy!!  No regrets.

Most of the flavors have the meat as the first ingredient. Amazon is able to sell at a very nice price. Sometimes .50 per can. You can also sign up for future del. & get even a lower price.

I need to put Forta Flora on his food and the only way it works is to give him Fancy Feast. He has a digestive problem and this is the only way I can correct it. I just call both of my cats and say "Fancy Feast" and they come running. I think my cats are human at times because they seem to understand. This is the first time that I have purchased this product through Amazon, but will continue to do so in the future. It is so convenient to have it delivered to my door and the price is better than I could have purchased it locally!!!

review/summary: One Spoiled Can Spoils the Batch
review/text: Initially my cats loved all three flavors of this Fancy Feast product. Then I got a box that had one badly deformed and bulging can; obviously bacteria were growing in it. I didn't even open it - just threw it away.<br /><br />I called the company to inform them. They asked for the production number from the can and sent me coupons for 4 free cans. Wonderful, as far as it goes, but that entire batch must have been bad because the cats would not touch any of the chicken-flavored cans remaining in the box. So I'm out eight cans, not just the four replaced.<br /><br />These things happen, but I can't afford to throw away money like that, so if it happens again, I will not be buying Fancy Feast. In the meantime, the cats love the beef first, and turkey comes in a close second.

review/text: My cat enjoys all flavors of Fancy Feast except the beef.  He'll sniff it and walk away, preferring instead to hunt for grasshoppers outside.  I'm not sure why he doesn't like the beef as it doesn't smell bad...but cats have that extra sense we lack and I will take his word for it that the beef in this package is not all too tasty.  Maybe the manufacturers should add more grasshopper or mice parts to it!<br /><br />I gave my three dogs their beef.  They thoroughly enjoyed the treat.

I am tryign to get them back on poultry/beef but they are not thrilled.  Even the turkey takes a while to get eaten (unlike the shrimp and fish feast variety which gets gobbled up in seconds).<br /><br />I will be giving these cans to my aunt for her cats and will deal with the loss of money.  Other than that - the price here on Amazon was great and it shipped right on time.  Amazon prime is really great - free 2 day shipping cant be beat!  :)

It's not as common as it takes longer to cook, but it has way more flavor and tastes amazing.

review/summary: absolutely wonderful
review/text: These puddings are wonderful.  I lived in England for 10 years and ate these all the time.  The reviewer who said they were disgusting obviously can't read the item description nor must they have properly prepared the item to eat.  You steam puddings, you bake pies.  Makes a big difference.  I would give these puddings 5 stars everytime.

review/summary: Steak & Kidney Pudding
review/text: Not to be confused with a pie, which has a flaky pastry cover,whereas the pudding has a suet cover. Just get a tin opener and then prize it out onto a plate. Into the microwave for about 2-3 Min's maximum. Then with mashed potatoes, beans and gravy, polish it off.(eat it) Unfortunatly not very popular in America so they are not cheap to purchase, so shop around. If you are really that desperate, try Amazon.co.uk and have a look at the prices.  I have always been a pie and chips guy so I love em!

review/summary: Too much pastry for my taste
review/text: As an American (of direct Scottish decent.), I've long enjoyed Fray Bentos Steak And Kidney Pies. Since rediscovering them through Amazon and their fine vendor Cooking Marvelous I decided to try their pudding. Now I've never been exposed to the pudding variant before so I was very careful to follow the the preparation instructions and boiled the tin in a covered saucepan for 45 minutes. It certainly required more attention than popping a Steak and Kidney Pie into a 450 degree oven for a half an hour or so.  However the cooking process was a success and soon I sat down to dine. I was initially surprised that the entire pudding was surrounded by what seemed to be an immense amount of steamed, soft pastry. Inside was the same tasty steak and gravy that I was accustomed to from the pies, but when all was said and done the pastry got the better of me. I did finish it but later felt as though I had swallowed a football. Overall, I give it a passing recomendation but I will stick to the pies in the future.

The tins should show a DISTINCT difference between the puddings and the pies. Instead the picture only shows the tops of the can.

review/summary: Leave's every other Ranch dressing crying in the dust
review/text: Hands down the best ranch dressing, dip, all around mix out there; BUT, it's only available in the Pacific Northwest. My friend from Seattle turned me onto this stuff when she sent it home with me via my suitcase, "Trust me, this stuff is amazing." One month later I bought a CASE of it off their website at something like $36. These babies were a precious commodity in my household and I waited patiently for my friend to come visit and bring me more of these wonderful little packages in California. I put a package in MY friend's suitcase as she went back to Germany, "Trust me, this stuff is amazing." And so the addiction spreads... Try this, you won't regret it. **I'm not responsible for your ensuing addiction**

review/text: I ordered this product to make waffle cones for my grandchildren but liked them so much I ended up making them mostly for myself.  Product works as advertised and is fairly easy to use.  I have tried both the mix and the recipes.  I prefer the recipes although the mix was good too.  I like the recipe for "Elegant Wafer Cones".  Because of convenience, I use Egg Beaters instead of whole eggs.  I also add Hersey's Chocolate Syrup to add flavor (experiment with quantity for your own taste).

review/summary: Fantastic taste, this is what cones are supposed to be...
review/text: My wife and I have tried a few different kinds of pre-made batter mixes, scratch recipes we have found, and tried fresh cones made at the local ice cream shops. This batter mix is by far the best we have tried.<br /><br />The mix comes in a 3lb box. The nice thing about its packaging is that each pound is packaged separately, so you don't have to worry about storing excess mix in sealable containers. Each pound package makes about 12 cones. We just need a few cones made at a time, so we use half a pound each time.<br /><br />The directions are very simple and clearly explained on the package. You only need two ingredients: mix from the box and water.<br /><br />Customer reviews are very important to me when selecting products to buy, and I am sure they are helpful for you too since you are reading this. I thank you if you clicked that this review was helpful to you.

All you have to do is put the chicken (or whatever) in a bag and shake.  No need to add anything else and bake... it 's a little spicy but it's awesome!

The price of this on here is over $10 more than if you bought it direct from Keurig, not including member discount, which brings it down to $13.13 for the same box on here. With a little more research, you can find a few spots online that are even cheaper than that. Just a helpful FYI for some of you on here. :-)
