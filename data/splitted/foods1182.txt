review/summary: Great choice for those who choose an all wet food diet for their cats
review/text: After a lot of research I decided to switch my cats to an all wet food diet. A website specifically recommended this brand of Fancy Feast as a more economical store brand variety of food because it has fewer fillers and more meat. There are certainly better varieties but the ones I saw on Amazon cost twice as much. When I started my two cats on the all wet food diet, I alternated days of this variety with cheap generic chicken flavored wet food (I believe it was mostly fillers and organ meat). They acted like they were starving on the days when I gave them the lower quality food, I would have to feed them an extra can. They would finish eating and beg for food an hour later. Now that I only use this variety, they are more active and less hungry and generally seem much more content. Soft shiny coats, bright eyes, lots of playing. As an added bonus, one of my cats is very large and heavy and the other is very small and skinny. The heavy cat has lost 4lbs (down to a trim 17lbs for his size) and the skinny little cat has basically maintained her weight. So, good reviews all around!

review/summary: Very Convenient
review/text: These are the flavors that our cat prefers.  Our cat, probably like yours, too, has very evident preferences in her food.  Ours likes Fancy Feast, but only the grilled-style in the seafood-type flavors.  Other brands and other flavors, even Fancy Feast, get ignored by our cat.<br /><br />The shipment of cat food (we bought about $75 worth) arrived quickly and well packaged, part of it in plastic-wrapped cardboard flats of 24 cans, and part of the shipment in 24 can boxes.  The cat food's freshness dates were well out into next year, and the cans were clean and in perfect, undamaged condition.<br /><br />The Amazon price is approximately the same as the price at our local big-box stores, but with Amazon's free shipping (and maybe no sales tax, depending on your state's tax laws), you can't beat the convenience of having cat food delivered directly to your door.

review/text: My cat's not a fussy eater, but she does have a strong preference for Fancy Feast, especially the pate-style varieties. She eats most anything I giver her without complaint, but shows her love of Fancy Feast by showering me with affection for 10 minutes or so every time I serve it.

review/summary: MY CAT LOVES IT N ITS CHEAP! lol
review/text: I did not expect my cat to love it so much, but as soon as it arrived I opened it and my cat smelled it then RAN to the can and could not wait to eat it.<br />They were smaller than expected (did not pay much attention to the size when buying it lol) but it is really good for the price, and the smaller size is actually better cause I do not wasted any of it, one cause my cat loves it so much and two cause there is none left over.<br />This 3 flavor box also helped a lot since my cat gets tired of certain flavors so this is keeping her interested in the food.<br />The best part about it, I have also mixed a little of the dry food with this can of food and she does not mind at all, the flavor and gravy are so good they cover the dry food well to make it really flavorful for her.

review/summary: Not sure yet...
review/text: I've ordered the Fancy Feast Seafood packs several times, and am discovering that one or both of my cats will refuse to eat a can every so often.  No rhyme or reason for it (meaning, it's not a particular flavor they refuse to eat), they just sniff it and walk away.  I haven't had that problem when buying the cans one by one at the local grocery store, or Target, or wherever. Even with a throwaway can now and then, it's still a good deal and I've continued to buy the variety packs.

I have a ton of $1.00 coupons for these boxes but would not use them because if I go to the local stores I would still pay more even with the $1.00 coupon!  I leave them on the cat food shelf in the grocery so keep an eye out for coupnos if you live in central CT!!

review/text: This is Max. I dictated this as I have a hard time with the keyboard.<br />Quite tasty. I do get sick of the same flavor day after day so I do enjoy having the variety. I luv the man in the brown truck that brings these delightful gourmet dinners for me. I do wish the staff lady would open the boxes right away so I can inspect them. She also doesn't keep a very good schedule of serving them to me either.Sometimes she's as much as 5 minutes late!  She also gets confused a lot about which one of the flavors I want. I often have to settle for tuna instead of salmon.<br /><br /> Humans are so hard to train. My only suggestion for the improvement of this food is more gravy......much more gravy....gravy...zzzzzzz.

review/text: I have two furkids. Chiyoko is finicky but will at least try foods, but Pachinko will not eat any canned cat food, except the Fancy Feast Grilled Seafood and the Fancy Feast Medleys Shredded Fare Collection. I have tried almost every canned and pouched cat food available (Friskies, Newmans, Natural Balance, and several other types of Fancy Feast like the gravy lovers), but after one sniff, she will not even try to eat it /cry.  I always come back to the two types I listed above. If you have a finicky cat, perhaps try the grilled seafood variety pack. It may end your frustration as it did mine.

I actually think it's better to buy smaller jars in larger quantities, because the Nutella tends to dry out if used up too slowly.  The listing doesn't state how large the jars are and they do come in various sizes.  Three small jars is better than one large jar.

review/summary: YUMMY and HEALTHY dog treat!
review/text: My 2 medium sized dogs absolutely love these garlic-veggie biscuits!  The treats are nice and solid (not crumbly messy) but are also easy enough to snap in half to make them last longer (a whole one is also fun to stick in their toy Kong and watch them figure out how to get it out).<br /><br />And since these treats have all healthy ingredients (no gluten or by-products or dyes or anything else unhealthy), it's a treat you can feel GOOD about giving your pet.  I haven't tried the honey or bacon-cheddar flavors yet, but definitely will.  My dogs give these 2 paws up! :)<br /><br />Ingredients: rye flour, oat bran, spinach, carrots, broccoli, celery, garlic powder, canola oil, eggs, baking powder.

review/text: My puppy does NOT like these! And well, mom doesn't like them either! The smell of garlic is so overpowering, I tossed them a week ago and I can still smell them! I think if your dog likes strong flavors these are for you, but they give my little guy diarrhea!! I would recommend the same brand in the Peanut Butter and Honey flavor, much gentler on tummies and my puppy can't get enough of them.

review/summary: Good Product!
review/text: Both of my dogs really enjoyed this rawhide alternative bone. My dogs have been eating real rawhide for several years, with seemingly no issues. Recently, one of my dogs had a terrifying near-death experience; choking on a rawhide. After doing some research, I learned that this isn't an uncommon situation, and that rawhides are a known choking hazard. After the incident, I quickly researched different rawhide alternative bones, and theses ones were one of the first we have tried. They have more of a leathery texture, softer and more flexible than a rawhide. However, they are not soft treats that can be chewed up quickly, it still took my dogs some time to eat them, and enjoying them for about 10 minutes. One thing that I really liked about these bones is that they don't get stringy, slimy, and sticky like rawhides do. They get softer with chewing, and then brake off into smaller pieces, unlike rawhides that won't brake off, making the dream bones less of a choking hazard. Another great thing about these bones is that they smell really good, they have parsley and chlorophyl and other good smelling ingredients. They only reason I gave them a 4 star rating and not a 5 star rating is because the first ingredient (the most prevalent) is corn. Corn isn't the greatest thing for pets to consume because its not easy to digest. I avoid corn in pet food at all costs, but because this is a treat- and not a main food staple, I think it is okay. If I could, I would give these bones 4.5 stars. I do recommend these- especially over regular rawhides.

I bought one of the "Farmers Market" from the regular grocery store to make sure my 8 month old liked it, which he did. I bought a case from Amazon, but the consistency was like soup, very runny unlike the one I bought from the store. Heating it up made it worse. Maybe it was a fluke, but the second case from Amazon ordered a few months later had the same problem.

review/text: First off, I'd like to say that this review is for the ALMOND BUTTER NUT BUTTER BALLS (gluten-free, vegan). I noticed that some of the reviews are for the different varieties, but this is the specific one I am doing.<br /><br />First off, they are awesome. They have a great almond flavor that I was surprised at when I first bit into them.<br /><br />Second, they aren't too fattening or calorie-laden, and they have a good little pop of protein without any funky ingredients.<br /><br />Third, they take the edge off hunger! These babies make a great snack between classes or at work or when I'm getting the mid-morning/mid-afternoon/late-evening hunger grumbles.<br /><br />But most importantly, they are vegan and gluten-free without compromising any flavor... which I think I said already so this statement is more for emphasis. I love these things, so glad I randomly decided to pick one up and try it!

review/text: These almond butter balls are a unique and delicious snack, chock-full of almond bits all over the exterior of the "ball." These provide a nice dose of fiber, protein, and healthy monounsaturated fats, which other snacks often lack. Unlike other Betty Lou's balls, this flavor does not contain whey (dairy) protein, so it is suitable for vegans or dairy-allergy sufferers. Also, just as a tip: these are very soft, so I always "smush" (thumb-knead) out the ball until it is a flat square, taking up the entire area of the plastic packaging -- they're much more satisfying to eat (pick at) and last longer that way. A great option when you're sick of "bars." I only wish they were organic (hence the missing star) and that Betty Lou's made more dairy-free balls!

review/summary: Great chocolates.  Problems with shipping
review/text: I bought these chocolates for my son's 1st birthday party and ordered them 3 weeks in advance hoping that they would arrive on time.  The seller called and assured me that they would arrive on time.  The package was sent in 2 separate boxes (one sent priority mail the other sent express mail.  Only one box arrived on time. I only had half of the amount of party favors for my son's party.  This was probably a mistake in shipping by the sender, but nonetheless a problem.<br /><br />The chocolates themselves are wonderful.  They taste great and look awesome.  If you decide to purchase this product, I would suggest you talk to the seller and make sure that the shipping is made on time to arrive for your event.  If you can get some sort of guarantee shipping date that would be great too.

review/text: What everyone who loves these needs to know is that if you have a Trader Joe's in the neighborhood and they don't stock this, or stock it intermittently, they will be quite happy to order a supply for you. That's what one of the helpful crew members at our local TJs told me, and it is definitely true. Now I have enough for a month or two (30 packages, purchased at the TJ price of $.99 each) and when I run out, I can order more.

review/summary: Addictive and delicious!
review/text: This review is going to sound very different from a normal one.<br /><br />First off, I would like to point out that yes, I gave it four stars on purpose.  Please keep that in mind and read this very thoroughly.<br /><br />I hate these snacks.  I hate them because they are so insanely addictive, I find it nearly impossible to "just have one."  Invariably, I end up consuming the entire package grinning like a giddy schoolchild.  Even if I put them away, I will inevitably find myself searching the package out, just so I can have one more.. and then again, and again, until the package is finally empty, and then I am sad.<br /><br />I hate them because of their fun, paper-thin texture, which makes it seem like you've some piece of unique candy, then it turns out to be a delicious, slightly salty, somewhat chewy snack which makes your brain scream 'Oooh, yay, SUSHI!' only for it to suddenly turn nutty in a twist which makes me want to have just one more to experience that fun crinkle of the sheets (for they are super-thin sheets of dried, roasted seaweed), the YAY of incoming sushi, that slightly chewy transformation, and then they dissolve into almost nothingness, leaving you reaching for another one.<br /><br />I hate them because the pack lasts about 45 minutes.  An hour and a half, if I'm demonstrating exceptionally strong willpower for the day.  Possibly longer if I can manage to convince someone *else* to hide them from me.<br /><br />I hate them because said pack gives me 40% of my Vitamin C for the day in less than half an ounce of actual dried seaweed.  And something that tastes so very delicious isn't supposed to be that healthy.  Bacon doesn't give vitamin C.  These snacks do.  That's confusing.  Snacks are supposed to be guilty pleasures, not delightful dietary supplements.<br /><br />I hate them because the only physical store that carries them in my area is Trader Joe's, and I always end up opening the pack after they are closed.  So when the package is empty and I am sad, I must wait until morning to "get my fix" again.<br /><br />I hate them because I ate an entire package while writing this review.  And now it is gone.  And now I am sad.  Thankfully, though, I can get them here and have them delivered to my door.  I might have to order a few of the six packs, though, to last me until the next order I place can arrive.  I'm working out a rationing calendar that I probably won't stick to for more than an hour.<br /><br />And finally, I hate that I don't hate these at all, but am hopelessly and utterly addicted to them.  Seaweed Anonymous, thou art my name.

review/text: Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snack is delicious and a great way to take the edge off of hunger!  This snack is delicately toasted in sesame oil, and come in little wafer thin "slices" of seaweed. The package is definitely something you could take on the go. I am not sure as to how long they keep - not that they will last that long. A great alternative to potato chips and more fattening foods!

review/text: I like this one better than Annie Chun's brand because it is lower in sodium, 50mg instead of 70ml.  The other one is too salty for my taste.  However Annie Chun's brand has a better aroma since it is roasted in sesame oil.  Every time I buy them, 20 at a time, I got a lot of stares from the people in line!  :)  My daughter, who is 4, can eat 2 packs of Trader Joe's brand at a time but she wouldn't eat but 2 sheets from Annie Chun's.

review/summary: Satisfying Salty Sea Snack
review/text: This salty, savory gem is so satisfying.  Packaged in an airtight container, it is as fresh and crisp as the moment it was packed at the factory.  Each package has only 60 calories--and that's for two servings!  The seaweed comes in thin, rectangular sheets of a beautiful shade of green.  As you take a bite, the crisp sheet reminds you of biting into a potato chip or popcorn--crunch and a bit of salt.  Once on your tongue, it begins to dissolve, giving you a more gelatinous texture.  If you enjoy Japanese foods such as sushi, this is for you.<br /><br />What a great, low calorie alternative to take to the movies.  Or, to lunch, to eat at your desk, in the car, at sports events, on the plane.  Easy to handle, small, crunchy, salty, chewy.  M-m-m, just plain yummy.

review/summary: If heaven came in a bag ...
review/text: It would be called Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snack.<br /><br />These dried pieces of seaweed are lightly coated in sesame oil and salt for a crisp, delicious snack. I'd never tried roasted seaweed before but I decided to give them a try. Needless to say, I now consider myself a seaweed addict.<br /><br />Seaweed has many healthy things in it that we most likely don't get from other sources of food we eat. The best thing about this snack is that you can eat the whole bag (and trust me, you will) and it's only 60 calories.<br /><br />You will pay a lot lower price if you buy it in the store rather than from Amazon. Not everyone has a local store to them so at least you have somewhere to buy this yummy treat!

review/text: I've been trying new things I wouldn't ordinarily even think of trying because they're healthy for me. My initial reaction was<br />not so great, but I could deal with eating them because they're good for me.  So days later, had more....okay I could deal with them a little better.<br />Then, days later I realized I was sitting at my computer & just popping them into my mouth & I was REALLY LIKING THEM A LOT.  Only 60 calories for the whole package.  They are flakey, lightly crunchy, & lightly salty in tast.  Sure beats having potato chips.  I went to trader joes & purchased 15 boxes for 99 cents each box just to make sure they're in the house when I get the munchies.<br />Definitely try them & give them a chance...

review/summary: My new favorite low-carb snack! :-9
review/text: If you love sushi, you'll also love these seaweed snacks.  They are my new favorite low-carb snack, and perfect for when I feel like munching on something (like when I'm watching a movie).  I have type 1 diabetes, and have to watch my carb intake.  I consider these snacks to be a "free food" as they do not impact my blood sugar, and I do not need to take any insulin when I eat it.<br /><br /> The ones I ordered did not have a wasabi taste to them, but a nice, pleasant, lightly roasted sesame taste.  They melt in your mouth and are a healthier alternative to chips, nuts, or popcorn when you need a little snack.<br /><br />I don't have a Trader Joe's where I live, so I'm glad I can order these from Amazon.  I will definitely be ordering more! :-)

review/summary: Surprisingly...Awesome!
review/text: I'm no vegetarian, and am certainly not a "granola girl," yet I find these so amazingly tasty! There's just a moderately salty crunch at first, and then they basically "melt in your mouth." The flavor is exactly like the seaweed wrapped around sushi rolls; no "fishy" taste.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I initially decided to try these because (1) they're crazy-low in calories, and (2) I'd heard about how healthy seaweed is. So glad I did! These - remarkably - satisfy my husband's salty-crunchy cravings, so we don't buy any potato chips/tortilla chips/pretzels/popcorn anymore!<br /><br />I really wanted to dock a star for (1) wanting to eat more than are in each package (aka: the package is too small), and (2) because they're pretty pricey compared to other salty-crunchy snacks. But, I just couldn't do it. They are too darn delicious! I would buy these in bulk at Costco if I could!<br /><br />Side note: I haven't done any research on the health benefits of dried v. fresh seaweed. I suspect that fresh has many more vitamins/nutrients, but that's purely my own speculation. If anyone has any info on this...please comment on my review so I can take a look. Thanks!
