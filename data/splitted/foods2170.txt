review/summary: Only flavored coffee my husband likes!
review/text: This coffee has a very strong cherry flavor.  It's the only flavored coffee my husband likes, though he prefers I cut with with 50% regular coffee to tone down the flavoring a bit.  While some people may view this as a negative, it is so refreshing to actually be able to taste the flavor in a flavored coffee.  Too many times I've bought flavored coffee and not been able to taste the flavoring at all!  Other members of my family like it full strength. I am very pleased with it and have purchased my second 3-pack.

review/summary: Pretty decent flavored coffee
review/text: My grandmother loves flavored coffees, especially cherry flavored.<br />The aroma from this bag will fill the entire house! And it's pleasant, not too overpowering.<br /><br />Of course will all flavored coffees- making it too strong can make the flavoring taste bitter (which *can* be a good thing!). I tend to like strong coffee (which is why I don't like flavored).  But I did try this, and I will say that I am keeping one of the bags for myself!  Every now and then something different can be good.<br /><br />Overall the cherry flavoring is pretty smooth and not too overpowering.<br />It would be nice if they used "northern Michigan" cherries to flavor, but who really knows.<br /><br />I gave it a 4, because while it's not something I would drink everyday personally- my grandmother loves it!<br />Plus, it's about the same price as what I can get locally, and tastes about the same. This is a little on the smoother side, though, which is a plus.

review/text: We make our syrup in our family of 7.  Its much cheaper than store bought and now that we're used it to it, we can stand store bought anymore.  We used to use Mapeline, but all the stores in our area stopped carrying it.  This isn't quite as good as mapeline, but its pretty close.  Much cheaper than buying mapeline online and the large bottles will last a long time.

It gives the birds a wonderful flavor. I make Maple Nut Rings for special occasion breakfasts/brunchs which calls for Maple Flavoring. I also like to make my own pancake syrup so I use a lot of Maple Flavoring. It is so convenient to be able to buy these large bottles and always have it on hand.

review/summary: Kinda ok, way overpriced
review/text: Bought this at Kroger for $3.64. $11 from this vendor? WOW.<br /><br />When I got it home, I was anxious to try it. I opened up the jar and ate a big spoonful. Didn't know my face could pucker up that much. This stuff is super salty. On a sandwich, the saltiness gets toned down but I can only tolerate it in moderation. I had to scrape a lot of it off the tomato sandwich. Its better if mixed with regular mayo.<br /><br />About 20 minutes after eating this, my lips got numb from all the salt. Kinda like theater popcorn lip numbness.<br /><br />I like the idea of bacon mayo but I think I will try another product or making my own.<br /><br />=========<br />2/29/12<br />=========<br /><br />Tried this in cole slaw and it was pretty good. Every comment about the cole slaw was positive and the huge bowl went quickly.<br /><br />My opinion of the product has improved but the saltiness is still an issue. We cooked a big batch of french fries and used this as one of the dipping sauces. The salted fries along with the Baconnaise was too salty for 3 out of 4 people.<br /><br />Still looking for an alternative with less salt.<br /><br />=========<br />7/14/12<br />=========<br /><br />Have you ever tried something and at first disliked it but then grew to really like it? That is me with this product. I really like it now. We have used it in everything from potato salad, cole slaw, deviled eggs, pasta salad, homemade salad dressing, a coating for chicken before breading then frying, etc....and it adds a new twist that most everyone seems to like.

review/summary: A bacon lovers dream come true!
review/text: Baconnaise -  I first discovered this treasure when a relative over seas asked for some "ham flavored mayonaise" they heard was available in the U.S.  I sent for this product through Amazon and it has been the  "go to" item for anyone who loves the flavor of bacon but doesn't need all the calories.  It has been a great hit with the men around my home as a pre-game snack with a cracker, a little Baconaise and ham or chicken.  I started giving it out as a little host gift or stocking stuffer at Christmas time.

review/summary: It's good. It's not bacon.
review/text: I first heard of this product while reading an argument over Jack-in-the-Box's new bacon milkshakes.<br /><br />I went to the manufacturer's website to do a little comparison shopping, and they had a tool for searching local stores to see who carries their products. After finding one, I paid a visit and came home with one jar of regular, and one of light.<br /><br />The consistency is of a thick spread, not quite as gelatinous as mayo, and the consistency feels appropriate to the flavor when you eat it. The sauce has very small bits of bacon or bacon-like substance in it. It is not sweet, not particularly salty (5% RDA for one tablespoon), and has a light flavor of smoked bacon. It's pretty high in saturated fat (14% RDA for one tablespoon), but, compared to actually eating bacon, that's pretty good.<br /><br />My first experiment was to try a fried egg sandwich: two slices of whole wheat, egg, Baconnaise. The egg and bread overpowered the sauce. I'll try a Baconnaise-lettuce-tomato sandwich next and post my results, but I suspect this stuff will do best as a dip for crackers or a veggie tray. If you could find a mild-tasting bread, it might also work in place of butter on toast for someone who can't eat bacon but who wants the taste.<br /><br />Experiment 2: substituted Baconnaise for mayo when making tuna salad (plain, just tuna + sauce). This made an EXCELLENT tuna, lettuce & tomato sandwich.<br /><br />Verdict so far: it tastes pretty good, but the only bacon in the world is... bacon!

review/summary: It is a good idea but a poor execution
review/text: I should have looked that the label more closely before purchasing this mayonnaise at my local grocery store.  However, when I saw it sitting there on it's shelf I immediately thought, "Bacon + Mayonnaise = Perfection!"  The big problem is that there is NO bacon in this product (the label even says that this spread is suitable for vegetarians).  Bacon flavor? Kind of.  The smell reminds me of the bacon flavored dog treats that I give to my little hounds and then rush to wash the smell off of my hands.  Not a pleasant association.<br /><br />The mayonnaise itself is a little thick and heavy.  I often make my own using fresh egg yolks, safflower oil, lemon juice and a little white pepper.  This has a very strong Liquid Smoke flavor to it which I find off-putting.  I can't help but wonder, why didn't they just put real bacon in this product?  I would gladly pay more if it was the real thing.  There is a product on the market called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZWV5Z4">Bacon Jam</a> and they get close to 20 bucks for a 7 ounce jar and people can't get enough of it.  If you use quality (i.e. REAL) ingredients people will stand in line to buy your product.  I would recommend that you skip this stuff and make your own, that's what I am going to do from now on.

If you want bacon mayo try taking your favorite mayo and add J and D's bacon salt to it then let it sit for a few minutes and you'll have a good tasting mayo with bacon flavor.

review/text: Let me start by saying that I love salty foods, love love love! But this beats even me, it is poisonously salty!!!! Disgusting and unbearable, even when mixed with regular mayo. Also, instead of bacon I'd say the flavor is closer to anchovies (which are pretty salty themselves). So instead of baconnaise this should be called anchovaise. Gross and overpriced!

I tried it right after opening, and thought OK.. this is not good when it's warm... So.. after a while in the fridge I tried a sandwich with it.. But, not really sure what I was eating I was not tempted to try it again.. So, it stood in the fridge and today I threw it out. It comes across as 'very weird' tasting, instead of being blown away by a Bacon Taste.. Not really I believe. Then I'd rather bake the real stuff, only every now and then ;-)

I bought a package of six cans, and I used them a lot faster than I thought I would.  There were just so many ways to use them, and they flavor and texture are great.  I often dice them and use them as a substitute for potatoes in stews and such for a lower carbohydrate alternative.  I also like them stuffed with scrambled eggs, topped with lowfat shredded cheese and baked.  Yum.  Also, I am not a huge fan of canned artichoke hearts, because I find the brine or whatever annoyingly overpowering.  Not so with the bottoms.  They have a sturdier, yet still buttery quality.  I'm hooked. I am buying more right now.

review/text: I have been using Walden Farms products since the company came to North America and they are a regular part of my shopping list. Their pancake syrup is thick and fantastic. This is so versatile and great on Salmon (maple glazed), chicken, turkey etc, in chili and stews instead of molasses, great in butternut/carrot/pumpkin pureed soups, in milkshakes, on toast (french toast, biscuits, bread puddings, or breakfast bakes, on eggs, pancakes, high-fiber cereal, in puddings, hot and cold cereals, desserts, ice cream souffles,and in steamed milk and hot coffee! This is great on waffles, or to bake with (great for cakes/muffins etc); I love pouring it on top of crumb cakes and letting it soak in. I especially love mixing it into Greek yogurt or cottage cheese. Adding it to pumpkin puree with some cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, and sweetener makes it tastes like pumpkin pie in a bowl, but healthy. Great way to have flavor without the added sugar.

review/text: The consistency of this syrup (as with almost all 0 carb, 0 cal products) is considerably runnier than a normal syrup. If you can get past that, the taste is actually much better than I expected. My husband didn't care for it much because he tried to keep it cold and put it on his pancakes. It wasn't good this way. I recommend leaving the bottle be room temperature, and pouring it over the pancakes right off the stove (or griddle) so that it soaks into the pancakes and warms up a bit.<br /><br />Note: We used Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Baking Mix to make the pancakes according to the recipe on the back of the package. The syrup may taste different with different pancakes.

review/summary: Best Walden Farms Product; Truly Delicious Pancake Syrup
review/text: Best product in the entire Walden Farms line.<br /><br />Tastes better than the light pancake syrup my husband uses from the grocery store (which is 50/calories per Tbsp) and more delicious than any other diet/sugar-free/light syrup I've ever tasted.<br /><br />Doesn't have any weird aftertaste.<br /><br />Consistency is nice and thick...not watery like some light syrups.<br /><br />Comes in either a medium-sized jar or in a six-pack of small, individual-sized packets (which you can take with you if traveling or going to a pancake house for b'fast).<br /><br />I give this product my highest recommendation.

review/summary: I miss the syrup stickiness
review/text: After reading many pro and con reviews, I thought I'd try Walden Farms Pancake Syrup since being diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes recently.  The taste is very mildly "maple" flavored....not bad, but I like more flavor.  It pours somewhat thickly and spread over things well.  I tend to pour more of this product than other low-carb syrups as they still have carbs that will add up fast into the "significant carb count" zone.  I pour more since it's sugar free, calorie free, fat free, and carb free, but if it's that free of anything then it must only be made from water plus lots of chemical stuff.  What I really do miss is regular syrup's sticky texture as you eat it with pancakes, French toast, or whatever.  I may not buy the product again, but it was worth a try.

review/summary: Try these out of the fridge or freezer; yum!
review/text: The hot fudge sundae pop-tarts are the only pop-tarts my son eats. He calls them "birthday cake." They are messy because the filling is like marshmallow fluff, but runnier. I think that's why my son likes these--they aren't as dry because the filling is like the consistency of thin pudding. Sometimes it's too messy for his taste, so I stick it in the fridge or freezer for 10 minutes and the filling freezes and he likes that. It's a great flavor to try. I'm glad I could get the family pack in bulk here for $28.11 with subscribe and save.

review/summary: Take The Cinnamon Matcha Challenge!
review/text: This is the easy way to swallow a teaspoon of cinnamon in 30 seconds or less!  Just use this Cinnamon Matcha instead, and whisk it in hot water.  You'll be gulping it up at record speed!  It is so yummy!<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, I know, that's not the idea behind the cinnamon challenge.  But, I assure you - this is much easier to swallow in 30 seconds, and better for you too.  (Yes, cinnamon is good for you, but it is very questionable, indeed, whether or not its healthy for you to swallow a teaspoon of dry, ground cinnamon.)<br /><br />This is really delicious.  The cinnamon is a spicy-sweet kind of cinnamon, reminiscent of Saigon cinnamon.  Very zesty - it enlivens the palate with its warm, exotic spice.  It makes a really nice combination with the sweet, buttery, vegetal notes of the Matcha.

review/summary: Great for blending!
review/text: I'm a sucker for cinnamon, so of course I had to try the Cinnamon Matcha. It smells so good. Sooooo good. Not like fake cinnamon hearts (which I adore too), but like real cinnamon. I want to slather this matcha on toast...but that would be weird. This is another matcha that inspires me to bake. Matcha snickerdoodles? Don't mind if I do! I need to start actually trying some of these recipe ideas. Like cinnamon matcha cinnamon toast! Or a cinnamon matcha apple pie! Nom nom nom.<br /><br />At first sip, it was delicious. At second sip, it was delicious. At third sip...well, you get the idea. There is something I don't care for about it, a bit of a tangy aftertaste, but that's not enough to keep me from drinking it! I'm excited to see how it will taste when blended with the vanilla. Ooooh, I should see if they have an apple matcha, that would be yummy mixed with this. Or pear! Oh dear, my list of desired matchas is growing longer and longer...<br /><br />But really, I just want to dump a whole mess of sugar into this and make some cinnamon raisin toast. And bake my little heart out! I think this is a matcha I will end up mixing more than making straight, but that's okay. I am seeing a wide world of possibilities coming from this little beauty. Cinnamon and I were good friends before, but I think is safe to say that this tea has pushed us over the edge into best friend territory. Plays well with others, makes me feel better, and encourages me to eat tasty, tasty sweets! I can see this becoming a staple in my cupboard, sitting right next to my beloved vanilla.

review/text: According to the hype on the bag as well as the nutrition information, this whole grain is quite healthy.  I've been eating it for breakfast almost every day for several months, and it seems to get me off to a good start.  Since the millet itself doesn't have much flavor, I fill a large bowl with 95% millet, and 5% granola sprinkled on top (plus some ground flax seed); I then add milk.  I get granola with each bite, and it makes the whole bowl really quite tasty, without being overwhelmingly sweet.<br /><br />It's cheap, healthy and filling.  Just make sure you have plenty of pantry space, as you get twelve large bags with this order.

review/summary: My favorite cereal
review/text: Arrowhead produces several puffed cereals but this is my favorite. First off, it doesn't get soggy. You can take several phone calls or even a shower and come back and find this stuff is still holding up to the milk. And because the kernels are small it's ideal for someone like me with jaw problems. The flavor is similar to popcorn, just milder. Only downside is that occasionally you'll get a bag where they haven't done such a good job of eliminating the hulls...bothersome buggers that have a tendency to cling to your gums etc. I start every day with a bowl.

review/summary: Wow, that's a lot of Millet!
review/text: Um... you get a lot of millet when you purchase this. Despite the size of the box (standard cardboard box size, needlessly double-boxed from Amazon), it was very light. Each bag I'd say is a little smaller in volume than a box of Kleenex, and you get 12. It looks like more than it sounds when you get them! The grains are very light and it's easy to have spills or overpours whether pouring out of the bag or from a secondary container.<br /><br />As for taste and texture, I agree what a reviewer of the Nature's Path version of this cereal said, that they are NOT toasted, just puffed. She put hers on a baking tray and toasted them to make them more crispy, instead of soft. I'm too lazy, and it seems like a possible waste of energy, so I just put up with it. That said, it doesn't really get soggy, either. Just imagine unsweetened puffed rice, only broke into little 3/16-inch balls. It just kind of relents when you crush it with your teeth, think really soft styrofoam (?).<br /><br />Taste-wise, not much taste, but what taste there is, is good. Tastes VERY similar--surprisingly similar--to puffed rice, just smaller... and not rice. Healthier than puffed rice in my strong opinion.<br /><br />It's not substantial enough for me to just eat it straight in milk for breakfast, but that's not what I bought it for. I think I'm like most people who purchase this, in that I bought it to augment other cereals. I add it to my Nature's Path Heritage flakes--which are very hard flakes, too hard, and the Millet being if anything 'too soft', kinda (?) balances that out sometimes. I like to mix different kinds of cereal, and this often gets thrown into the mix.<br /><br />Unlike the big-o box of Nature's Path Heritage flakes I bought, I'm not really sure I'll ever use all of this! Wow. I only bought it from Amazon because I couldn't find it anywhere else. The Heritage flakes have millet in them too, but it looks to be whole or cracked grain, not puffed--and apparently not even turned into millet flour, which is disappointing.<br /><br />As for the hulls, there are some but they haven't caused a problem for me. The hulls are a thin skin, almost the same color (very light brown or yellow), and in small pieces which I rarely if ever notice. I've also noticed that if you keep the cereal in the same vertical orientation, the hulls will, over time, migrate down. So if you're concerned (and you don't need to be), maybe put them in a plastic container, and keep topping off the container, so you're always drawing from the top.<br /><br />In retrospect, I'd like to see a millet-based cereal which is not puffed, and is not just hard pieces of whole millet, but uses ground/milled millet in some kind of creative form, even if it's a flake. Maybe I should start my own company.

However, note that this brand has a LOT of hulls which can spread and float around when you first open the bag. So beware and brush your teeth if you have anywhere special to go after consuming this. They will get stuck in your teeth.<br />You might also want to keep tabs on this product's price which seems to fluctuate significantly. Right now, it is over $31 WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for puffs, especially considering this is not organic.

If you are looking for a good quality, healthy, weight loss-promoting whole grain that you don't need to cook - here it is.  Get it.<br /><br />Because I rely on reviews when shopping online, here a little warning: recently I found out that millet (in any form) can actually contribute to a pancreatic attack, gull bladder inflammation, it is not advisable for people with gastritis and other upper digestive problems.  A relative who has chronic pancreatitis, got very sick and a research revealed, that the culprit was a big millet cereal meal.  Myself, recently diagnosed with gullbladder & stomack problems, also have to cut down on how much millet i have - otherwise a lot of long-lasting pain is guaranteed...<br />Be well!

review/summary: Changed formulas?
review/text: We have four indoor dogs that ever since they were puppies we have fed them science diet. The main reason was because chicken was the first ingredient. Now I have notice since December our dogs have really started shedding. There fur also is not as soft as it used to be. I just thought maybe they were shedding their winter coat. Well I finally remembered to check the ingredients on the bag this week. Boy was I shocked when I read the first ingredient now. It is no longer chicken on my bag. It is ground whole grain corn. Now if I wanted to feed them that I would buy the much cheaper dog food. So check your bags for the ingredients. I will no longer be using Science Diet.

These people hired by the company will RUN YOU IN CIRCLES "standing by their food" yet REFUSES TO ANSWER a single question posed to them.  They have the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE to date.  They even LISTEN IN ON CONVERSATIONS while on hold.<br />I dare you to call them to get a list of TOXINS they test for in the food!<br />They will say they do not have access to the list in their department.<br />Good luck with this brand, I am up to $2500.00 in vet bills.

review/summary: Please avoid!!
review/text: Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your dogs.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  i would recommend going to [...] and compare brands and see what is right for you budget wise.

review/summary: Allergies in a bag.
review/text: Science Diet, like Walmart brand Ol Roy dog food is made up primarily of corn and other known dog allergens. My last dog had so many health problems and allergies as a result of being fed nothing but SD. Now I'm better informed on dog nutrition and only buy 4 or 5 star foods according to dogfoodadvisor.com and practice the rotation diet. Never again will I subject a dog to overpriced, crappy food when you can get the good stuff for the same price or less. Even if you have to pay more for better food it works out cheaper because they'll have fewer health problems.

review/text: I enjoy my hot cocoa (or drinking chocolate) dark and not too sweet. This had the right flavor -- dark, intensely chocolatey and only slightly sweet. But the texture... This comes in the form of very tiny chips, and I could not get those things to melt all the way. I followed the directions precisely and still ended up with a cup of hot chocolate milk with chocolate sludge at the bottom. It has to be stirred before every sip, and even then it's not very smooth.

review/summary: Cold Brew Favorite
review/text: This is some great coffee, better than any flavor of Starbucks or grocery store grind-your-own.  The flavor is smooth and mellow vanilla with hints of caramel.  I like iced coffee, so I cold brew mine, which brings out the smoothness of the flavors even more.<br /><br />The 3-pack price is pretty comparable to buying a single pack of this (or Starbucks) on sale from a grocery store.  Give it a try...I found this about a year ago and have tried 6-8 other brands/flavors since then but always come back to ol' Folgers Vanilla Biscotti.<br /><br />Cold Brew:<br /><br />Mix 2 c. ground coffee with 9 c. water in a pitcher and let it sit on the counter for 10-12 hours.  Strain (I use a coffee filter in a funnel) into another container, and store in the fridge for up to two weeks.  This is a concentrate, so when you pour a glass, mix it with an equal amount of water.<br /><br />If you enjoy iced coffee, please, PLEASE do not hot brew coffee and then cool it down.  It's like looking at a mediocre painting of a mountain range...you sit there looking at it, thinking you're enjoying yourself, with no idea that the actual mountains are at your back.  Turn around and realize what you've been missing: buy this coffee and cold brew it.

review/summary: ADDICTIVE and TREMENDOUS!
review/text: Ok - I do not typically -- and I mean DO NOT -- like flavored coffee.  Usually the sensation is: "Wow - it really sorta DOES taste like (fill in the blank for the flavor)", then has an aweful aftertaste AND WORST - ALWAYS tastes like a CHEMICAL VERSION of the flavor it's supposed to be.  This stuff - I swear tastes a bit like REAL Vanilla beans were just wrung out over your cup and stirred in.<br /><br />We had it as a K-Cup amongst a variety of some 10 flavors.  I kept loving it and just remembered that it was "the one with a blue label".  I was surprised later it was good ol' Folgers.  I FINALLY remembered to tell my wife: "Oh - I keep forgetting to tell you: I LOVE that Folgers K-Cup".  She said: "You and my brother and everybody else!".  We're both rugged guys, as is my best-friend, who was over last night and said: "I gotta interrupt you -- this is REALLY good coffee".  Note: My best friend and I hunt, fish, and we all drive pickup trucks and/or big motorcycles.<br /><br />I thought - I HAVE to write a review for this place.  Hence, here it is.  It's NOT cheap.  But - HOW much value do you place on utterly enjoying a cup of coffee?  How SHORT is life?  And you're only paying (per bag) about 2.5 cups of coffee at Starbucks (which tastes like potting soil anyway).<br /><br />Try it - you'll LOVE it!

review/text: I was looking foward to trying Folger's flavored coffee, as I recently ordered, and was extremelly pleased with, arbuckle's flavored coffees from amazon.<br />The Folger's was a huge disappointment!! While Folger's regular, unflavored coffee is very good, these (both the vanilla biscotti and chocolate truffle) were absolutely awful. I normally drink about 8 cups of coffee daily, yet was unable to drink more than 1/2 of a cup of this swill.<br />Coffees were delivered quickly (that's one star), aroma was good (the second star), but the coffee was extremelly bitter, and had a heavy "burnt" flavor. I did try adjusting the strength, adding sugar, cream, cinnamon, etc, but the taste was simply too harsh for anything to help.<br />I am donating the unopened packages to the food drive in hopes that someone will like it (unlikely, but better than throwing them in the garbage).

review/text: I have enjoyed Postum since drinking it with my grandmother as a small child. Yes I drink it sometimes instead of coffee, esp when I don't want coffee's diuretic effects, but it isn't a replacement for coffee. To rate it on its similarity to coffee is like giving camomile tea 3 stars for its dismal replacement value to Salada tea. Postum is a fullbodied tasty hot drink. It is slightly sweet, having molasses as one of the ingredients, and tastes excellent with bit of milk. As it is an instant beverage, it is fast and portable, easy to take with on a camping trip or to the office with no gear needed to brew it. Very satisfying late at night. Good with chocolate. Can also be put into a cup of hot milk. And unfortunately this month discontinued by its manufacturer, Kraft, after 113 years on the market.

Only Postum (the<br />name was never its biggest selling point) was just perfect for after dinner.  The hot, unique flavor experience I enjoyed  every evening is gone --<br />damn you Kraft Foods!  I wish some other  company would manufacure this wonderful retro product. It was more than a memory, it was almost an<br />addiction, and I sure miss it!!

review/summary: BRING IT BACK!!! PLEEEEEEASE!!!!!!!
review/text: My Mom used to drink Postum and now that I am in my early 40's, I know why.  I can drink regular coffee only once in a while because of the caffeine content.  It gives me that jittery feeling.  And I so remember the taste of Postum.  I think it's even better than decaf!!  So, if Amazon can convince the Kraft Co. (I think it was made by them????) to bring it back into circulation, I would probably be only one in thousands of people who would be absolutely thrilled!

review/summary: What a retro piece of history-great stuff!
review/text: Postum was a grain beverage that was the answer to coffee for people who didn't drink caffeine beverages.  My dad drank postum all the time for breakfast or weekends.  The great thing back in those days (1970s) was that even us kids (5 of us) would drink it with him.  It doesn't have that pungent coffee smell but it was soooo good to us kids.  A little milk and sugar made it look like a creamy cup of coffee, add a bagel and donut-YUMMY!. I drank it up until it was discontinued November of 2007.  What a real retro memory.

review/summary: not so sure...
review/text: I decided to be brave, spend the 20 bucks after shipping and buy an 8 ounce bottle of the new release of Postum from [...]  I still have one unopened bottle of the original postum left in my pantry that I just cant bring myself to open,  so I compared at least the looks against the new one.  The new bottle, first of all is plastic.  Thats fine I have no problem with that,  that shouldn't effect the product. I noticed the color of the mix is a lot darker than the original Postum, almost like it has oil in it or is wet  and less "grain like" in its consistancy, more like  a fine sawdust. After comparing the two bottles side by side the moment of truth was now at hand.  I cracked the seal on the little white paper stuff that covered the top of the bottle.  To my suprise there was almost no smell. I do remember the original postum having a distinct smell when you stick you nose an inch or two from the bottle,  and this hardly had any odor to it.  I took my 1 spoonful of mix and dumped it into a hot cup of water.  It created a ton of foam as it mixed in,  which I dont rember the original doing.  I then poured my  small amount of milk in it, and it turned a very light color.  I added a touch of sugar and prepared for the taste.  the first sip was kind of flat.  I had to ask "did I put way to much milk in,  or not enough mix?"  well,  I finished most of the cup and found myself a little let down.  to me the first cup didnt seem like an exact match to the good old Postum of 2008.  Weak on aroma and a little weak on taste.  I will experiment alittle with the mixture and see if I can improve it,  but I probably won't be buying another bottle.  Were my expectations to high?  Maybe,  but if my memory of Postum is better than the real thing I think Ill stick with just the memory!
