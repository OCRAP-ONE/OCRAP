review/summary: Yuck, Yuck, Yuck
review/text: I really wanted to like this product but sadly, I hated it.<br /><br />The texture was weird. Some pieces were almost "pre-chewed" in texture while others were so tough and full of gristle you couldn't eat them.<br /><br />The smell was just foul. I ordered the Teriyaki flavor and have never smelled anything like this before. It smelled rotten, rancid. The smell clung to your hands.<br /><br />There was a thick grease on each piece. I've never had jerky that was so greasy.<br /><br />I am feeding the strips I didn't eat, that would be almost the whole bag, to my dog. She likes them and hasn't gotten sick, yet.<br /><br />I've never left a harsh review before but this product was so beyond bad I had to be brutally honest. I'm sure there are people who love this product but I am not one of them.

review/summary: The best jerky!
review/text: This is the best jeky I've had. It's so good that I've setup an automatic shipment every two months. I ran into this product in Barstow, CA at a T/A stop. I decided to give it a try since the clerk stated that it was the best jerky she had ever tasted. She was right, it was excellent and made for a delicious snack enroute to Las Vegas. The jerky isn't hard, but not really soft either. Just a nice balance of texture. The heat comes on slow and takes a few pieces to really be felt, but the sweetness of the jerky is just right, so TASTY! Give this jerky a try, it's wonderful that these come in 1lb bags. Anything smaller and I think I would end up eating a bag a day.

review/summary: It was pretty good.
review/text: I gotta say..... I enjoyed this bag of jerky. I ordered the sweet and hot and it was just as good as any other beef jerky brand I have ever had. Was it greasy? Yeah, a bit. Not any more or less than others. It was moist and tender more than greasy. Did it have fat on it? Yeah. A few pieces, but honestly, those taste the best to me. I guess I like all kinds of beef jerky except for the dried out, harder than leather kinds. I don't mind having to chew, but I can't stand the type that is almost too hard to eat. This was not like that. It was moist, tender and juicy with some good flavor. I am getting it again. Might not be the best that is out there, but it is pretty good.

review/text: This is true jerky not the kind that looks stamped or processed. This being said because of the natural variances of beef some pieces are smaller or contain a trace of fat or may be grisly but this is not a common occurrence. I purchase 4 pkgs of this per month and have been for 8 months. In my opinion, this is the best out there for the price. Its consistent in quality and you get 16oz. I have tried all the flavors and my favorites are Hickory, Peppered and BBQ so this review will apply to these flavors.

review/text: The sweet & hot has an excellent balance of spice, if you want something moderately hot but not extreme.  The jerky is ok, not great; it has a higher proportion of fatty pieces than most brands I've tried.  But it's an excellent value with good flavor, so I can't complain too much.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.

review/text: I have to tell you.<br /><br />I'm a contractor working over-seas in Afghanistan. I have been doing this for over 2 years now, and we have stores called "The PX" where we can buy American goodies... right, the beef jerky. They have a huge selection of beef jerky but by the time it gets here 70% of the time its tough and no longer good. But we buy it anyway.<br /><br />I received a care package from a friend full of this "Wild Ride beef jerky" in it and let me tell you, It was soft, tasty delicious, not too salty, not to over flavored, and just plane old amazing! Now I'm addicted! My friends and I can now relax after a hard day of work open a bag and remember the green grass, the mountain air, and the lovely beaches of the old red, white and blue.<br /><br />Sounds to good to be true, but its amazing beef jerky.<br /><br />Thanks Wild Ride.

review/summary: Very tasty, but goes moldy quickly.
review/text: The teriyaki jerky was very flavorful, not too sweet or salty; and pleasantly chewy too, as opposed to the dry/stringy stuff I've tried elsewhere. The price was reasonable. My main problem is that several bags went moldy within weeks. Several other buyers have the same complaint. The first time I thought it came that way and it slipped by me. I checked as the other bags arrived, and saw them quickly turn fuzzy. I realized I'd have to eat it all within a week or two or throw it out once it starts to go bad. It may be moot, since it's been discontinued as of March 2011. I don't mind the additives so much, but would  appreciate if (assuming they bring it back) the stuff could keep a bit longer.

review/text: This jerky was decent.  The softness of the pieces were in general pretty good, a little on the hard time sometimes but overall soft enough to chew comfortably.  They do vary a little bit within the bag so some pieces may be a bit too hard, but usually they don't get too soft.  The Sweet and Hot flavor tasted pretty good; so did the Teriyaki.  I'd recommend both!

review/text: Do not buy Wild Ride Beef Jerky. I purchased two bags of this jerky and they both ended up in the trash. I know Beef Jerky is supposed to be somewhat jerky but Wild Ride takes it to another level. Half the pieces are not edible. Maybe they should advertise this as bubble gum instead of jerky? The taste is OK, average at best. I think the only good thing about this product is the price. It is cheaper than most of the other brands out there. However, if price is what you're going for, go chew on some spare tires that are in the junkyard. What is sad is that rubber tires are probably more chewable than Wild Ridge Beef Jerky. Seriously, don't buy this brand.

review/text: I receiced the order quickly of both the Hickory and the Sweet & Hot.  Have not opened the S&H yet but only the Hickory beef jerky.  The cut is very thick and meaty and not chewy at all.  I think it is too salty plus the fact that the packaging contains a large amount of crumbs (tiny bits of meats) as if they was loaded in the bag to make it one pound.  After mixing some grounded black pepper and sprinkled some sugar, the jerky tastes a lot better.

review/text: i ordered this on a whim because i love jerky, i love bbq, and Pounds of Jerky are usually around 20-25 bucks and I figured 2 bags of this brand of Jerky was a pretty sweet deal. I got barbecue and teriyaki.<br /><br />Taste is great, it was very fresh and flavorful, and the jerky was the perfect tenderness.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. Well, the barbecue. Now the Teriyaki, that's another story. Very bland flavor, tasted like regular beef jerky that was thrown in some teriyaki sauce for a few minutes before packaging, definitely nowhere near the quality of the bbq. Same great tenderness though. I can't wait to try the other flavors. :D

review/text: I ordered this on a lightning deal so I got a great price. This jerky is tender and delicious. I believe it is one of the best I've had. The flavor is bold but not overpowering. It is mildly spicy and of course it's salty. I really enjoyed this product and plan to order it again. If you like jerky and are not worried about where the meat comes from or nitrates as other folks stated then you will probably love this stuff.

review/summary: Great tasting, great portions
review/text: True, it's not the healthiest beef jerky. But it's healthier than most kinds you buy in the store. It taste amazing, much better than Jack's Link's or whatever you find in the store. I bought the 4 bags for 13 dollars. And if it goes on sale again, I'll buy it again and again. However, if I get the hankiering for beef jerky again, this will certainly be the brand I'm after.

review/summary: YUMMO!!!
review/text: This is great jerky! Tender, but still chewy and satisfying (not like shoe leather!); the slightly thicker slice on the meat is great. I really appreciate the salty/sweet taste of the Hickory marinade, with its nice hint of black pepper. I think they got it just right. There is enough spice to satisfy adult taste buds, and I don't think the heat will overwhelm older children, but for the little ones, the Teriyaki flavor is sweeter and less spicy. This is definitely a product the whole family will enjoy. Now, if they would just include a small packet of dental floss in each bag, it would be perfect!

review/summary: Excellent jerky! Great flavor & texture. My South Beach Phase 2 snack of choice!!
review/text: Solid strips of flavorful beef, slightly tenderized with natural papaya enzymes, gives this jerky a nice bite without stressing out your jaw muscles. Pleasant natural smoke and pepper flavor doesn't overwhelm like so many other brands - the beef flavor comes through. Very low fat (0.5 g) and carb (1 g)per 1 oz serving make this jerky my South Beach Phase 2 snack of choice. Great for an on-the-go protein fix. BTW - 1 oz is a substantial portion to snack on!!!

review/summary: Different People, Different Tastes
review/text: I guess there's no accounting for people's tastes. After reading the glowing reviews, I was ready for a taste treat. Not what I got.<br /><br />I've had many different jerkies, and made my own several times. In the old days, jerky was made to keep without refrigeration, and to have a handy food to carry along on the trail. Also to cover the taste of what was probably less than fresh beef.<br /><br />I like a spicy flavor, with just a little bite to it, sometimes a little sweet, sometimes with a teriyaki flavor.<br /><br />This product (at least the original flavor) is none of these things. It tastes like a piece of steak was partially cooked and partially dried with no added spices or flavors. Just a dull piece of meat. Gone also is the leathery texture of the jerky I'm used to. It is slightly chewy, but not the texture of real jerky that takes time to chew and allows you to enjoy it for awhile.<br /><br />So if that bland tasteless type of jerky is your cup of tea, this may be for you. It just doesn't ring my bell.<br /><br />Somewhat of a disappointing purchase.

review/text: There's finely fuzzy white mold all over this stuff, and Amazon's return policy of food: You're SOL.  DISGUSTING!  Looks I've learned that grocery shopping on Amazon is not a particularly good idea.  Since I bought three different 1lb bags of this stuff in different flavors I'm out some cash.  Granted this one was the only one with mold, but the other two were complete inedible as they were made from cartilage scrap cuts - the stuff that either gets thrown away or fed to the pigs.  This flavor probably was, too, but since it has mold on it I'm not about to find out.

I noticed that the "beef" did not come from USA per the package. Makes me wonder what kind of "beef" they are shipping in to dry. Is it old and rotten? Is it even beef? Sure doesn't tast like any beef jerkey I'm used to. Yuck.

review/text: I got the hickory smoked version and it's packed with salt. I know jerky tends to have a high salt content, but this is the first time it has ever bothered me while eating it. It's usually an after effect like being thirsty. I really regret buying this and would much rather go back to Jack Link's X stick which are less nutritious and taste more like meat flavored than real meat.<br /><br />Salty taste aside, the pieces are thick and are of medium toughness (i.e., prepare to use some mouth muscles), which are good. Unfortunately, I sometime run into overly chewy pieces.

review/text: I love my beef jerky and this is the style I like at a great price, especially if subscribed. At $11 for a pound shipped, how can anyone complain? Since preferences differ, I'd class myself as disliking the moist style beef jerky that have become popular in recent years, I would say this is similar jack links, a bit more dehydrated. My favorite used to be a bone dry japanese brand I cant seem to find anymore. It's not quite that dry, and they do tenderize it it in some manner. However, not over processed so you'll some across vein and fat as some reviewer complained of, but it give it a very natural texture. I give it 5 stars although its not perfect in consideration of the absolutely low cost as 4 1/2 isn't an option.

review/summary: Must be your first time trying jerky if you left good review
review/text: Let me say this first:  our family of 6 keeps a high protein, low carb diet, and we eat a lot of jerky each month ( avg 30 lbs).  We have tried a vast majority of jerky out there, and can tell a good jerky from bad.  I have no idea how can anyone leave this jerky a positive, not to mention gleaming review.  Must be the first time trying jerky.  FIRST:  there is NOTHING natural about this jerky.  Few noticed, but their packaging used to say "all natural", but NO MORE, because they know it is not.  Now it says " naturally hickory smoked", or the like.  WHO CARES.  your jerky has so much cr_p in it that naturally smoking it makes no difference.  This jerky is full of salt.  this jerky is packed with MSG - and i mean PACKED!!!  This jerky is quite greasy. NOTE:  Bulk packaging ( 1 lb bags) are a bit better than smaller bags, and meat type in bulk bags is different.  YES&lt; this company has absolutely zero consistency.  If you take 20 chunks out of a bulk bag, you will see that there are 4-5 different kinds of meats there.  some wil be moist and chewy, others will be nothing but rubber, some with thick tendons running through, and some are quite marbled.  Just when you find a piece to your liking - you are back searching for a lucky chunk again.  smaller bags, especially teriyaki is very greasy and has so much coating that you taste all the chemicals way before you get to meat flavor ( if you can call it that).<br /><br />i'd give this jerky a 2 if there was meat consistency, but its a total crap shoot.  you can find LOTS of other - better tasting jerky in the same price range, here on amazon.  even the middle of the road obertos is much better than this stuff.  WILD RIDE JERKY IS A JOKE and IS GROSS.  Buy at your own risk, but know that you are buying a truly chemically processed and preserved jerky - full of MSG and 0ther additives.<br /><br />OH, and those 1 lb cowboy stips bags?  Well,  there was exactly 10 oz of strips in a bag - rest was jerky shavings and bitsNpieces - similar to what oberto sells as bulk packages salad topper shavings of jerky - NO STRIPS!!!  we tried every flavor in their bulk=-packaged variety and this holds true for every single package.

review/summary: Decent taste, cheap meat
review/text: I did not like the taste or texture of Wild Ride Original but decided to give the company one more chance as this flavor was on sale.  While the flavor is better, unfortunately the meat is of such poor quality that it's difficult to recommend.  I uploaded three images as examples of what you will find in a typical bag.  You'll see that about 10-15% of the pieces are marbled in a high amount of fat which is odd because meat was originally smoked not only to add flavor but to get rid of fat so it would last longer.  I'm not sure what's happening here.  Some pieces have hardened grease settling on them, most likely due to the meat being smoked on something similar to a conveyor belt as opposed to hanging in a smoker.  Finally, the pieces that don't have any apparent fat or grease may still contain gristle as another reviewer mentioned.  It's not horrible, but it is of low quality to match its low price.  I wouldn't recommend it to any serious jerky lovers but you can check the at the top of the page and decide for yourself.

review/summary: Moldy meat.
review/text: I bought two bags (original) which were delivered to me on November 16th...<br /><br />The first bag was good. It had soft pieces of jerky mixed with annoying hard pieces of jerky. The meat has a nice fat to meat ratio, you know when you bite down on a fatty piece of meat. However, the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly, some pieces of meat were more salty than others.<br /><br />The taste is quite enjoyable. (I'm known to eat anything... & can acquire taste) If you don't mind fishing out the bad parts...<br /><br />However, my second bag developed some kind of mold. I started on the second bag without knowing that this bag contained a mold ball right in the middle of the bag. About half way through I found the moldy meat. I had read of this occurring in some people's product but I dismissed it as a freak chance.<br /><br />The mold is white, it reminds me of bread fluff. The mold is very bitter. I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten. IMHO.<br /><br />Would I buy this product again?<br /><br />No. a 50% chance of getting moldy meat... Well I don't wanna chance it.

review/summary: No Better Taste, Worse Nutrition Than Local Brands, Higher Price
review/text: It gets one star for the price, fat and salt content and because it's 3.65 oz. rather than the 4 oz. in brands available in local groceries.  The pieces were thick and flat, which is more attractive than the wrinkly stuff.  But the fat content is 13% compared to a more typical 2% and delivers 35 fat calories per 1 oz serving compared to a typical 5 calories from fat in a 1 oz. serving from the three different brands our local Kroger Grocery carries.  All that fat didn't make it more tender or less chewy.  And that fat is displacing protein in a 1 oz serving, so 1 0z. delivers 90 calories instead of 70.  And there was 520 mg salt compared to 470 from the store brands.<br /><br />Unless this just hits your palate in some incredible way, can't understand why anyone would buy this product.

review/summary: It's great for espresso!
review/text: I'm writing this to offset the overly negative review that someone else posted earlier. I've used a variety of methods for mixing coffee (drip-brew and espresso) with flavoring (both syrups and/or flavored creamer) and never liked the result. So now I just don't use flavoring syrups unless I'm adding other ingredients like milk or ice or any of the myriad of barista's secret elements. I use coffee syrups for all kinds of flavored espresso varieties (hot and cold) and White Chocolate flavoring is just another tool to make a semi-exotic (but certainly customized) beverages. It should be safe to assume that if you don't like a White Chocolate drink from a coffee shop, you won't like white chocolate syrup either.<br /><br />Disclaimer - I've used some of Da Vinci's other syrups, but not white chocolate syrup. The local coffee shop sells a different brand, for less than Amazon's shipped price, and it's so easy for me to stop in for more or new flavors. While it is certainly possible that Da Vinci's White Chocolate Syrup is a total failure and doesn't represent 'white chocolate flavor' well, the other scathing review seemed to be based on a limited use of coffee flavorings in general. Your mileage will, of course, vary.

The best part is the flavor-- not overly sweet, no chemical-y aftertaste. It's great to find a product that is both so wholesome and so delicious!

review/summary: Good flavor, but too many "hulls"
review/text: We tried McCanns oatmeal about a year ago, ordering the variety pack. It was delicious and healthy. So I decided to order one of the favorite flavors, Maple & Brown Sugar. It was still delicious and healthy, but I don't remember having so many "hulls" in the oatmeal. I'm assuming these little hard bits are part of the outer layer of the oat, harmless but not really edible. My daughter won't eat it now because of it, so I'm stuck with too much oatmeal. At least it keeps well, but I'd hesitate to order again.

review/text: This oatmeal is great.  I eat it almost every morning.  The brands in the stores I was buying had changed the texture and I did not like them anymore.  I coould not find an oatmeal I liked so I stopped eating oatmeal..... until I found out about McCann's. The cost is the same as in the store and with free shipping from Amazon, I don't lose out at all.

review/text: I eat this oatmeal 4 days a week for breakfast and it lasts until mid-afternoon. I eat 2 portions at a time, with a dash of soy milk and maybe a half a handful of raisins. 1 minute 40 seconds is perfect, but it will differ for each microwave. Definitely high in sugar, but I don't eat much other sugar laden foods otherwise. Goes great with a strong cup of fresh ground joe.

review/text: What more could I want at breakfast?  This oatmeal isn't too sweet, but it doesn't sit in the bowl like a lump of paste, either.  It has body and enough sweetener in it to give it some taste.  With a banana and some cold juice, I have a good breakfast; and my doctor kids me that I can start eating Big Macs any time.  (He can't believe how low my cholesterol is.  I certainly don't attribute the level to this product, but eating sensibly doesn't hurt.)<br /><br />By the way, as a "controlled" epileptic, I appreciate a breakfast food that can be fixed extremely easily.  Basically I just watch the kettle until it steams, then add the water to the cereal and stir.  What a deal!

review/summary: Much better than Quaker Oats
review/text: I purchased this product looking for something of higher quality than what I could find at my local grocery store. This product did not disappoint. For starters, it tasted fresher. This may be due to the fact that each serving is sealed in a foil packet instead of a standard paper one. I also found the flavor came through a lot more than my Quaker oats brand. I could really taste the maple goodness. Finally, I am not sure if these are called something, but when I had Quaker oats, I would often find myself biting into something that was hard, maybe the consistency of heavy paper. So far, I haven't had this issue with McCann's. If you like oatmeal but want something that tastes better than your standard store brands, I recommend this.

The thickness can vary depending on how much water you add, or how long you microwave it.  I tend to prefer it a little thin and creamy as opposed to thick and pasty, and it comes out just fine the way I like it.

review/text: We have been a fan of this brand ever since we discovered it 3 months ago! We eat this every single morning and very happy knowing that we are doing our bodies good by eating healthy and lowering our cholesterol! I have my Dr's appt this coming week and I cant wait to get lab work done and see how much my Cholesterol has lowered because 3 months ago the Dr wanted me to start taking pills to lower it. Instead, I hid the pills in a drawer and started eating this oatmeal every morning and my sister did the same and in just one month when she had eaten this her DR was amazed she dropped her cholesterol by 40 points!!! Great! So, I am hoping that in 3 months mine is going to knock his socks off.lol.I have this oatmeal set up to automatically be shipped to me every 2 months! I might have to change it to once a month,lol, my son likes to eat this even at night sometimes and I have on occasion done the same. Bon appetite!

review/summary: Oatmeal treat for Celiacs
review/text: I have purchased many of McCann's oatmeals.  Both the plain slow cooking variety and the instant flavors. I discovered this brand while reading a Celiac blog somewhere.  As I recall, McCann's does not let anyone into their plants to test for Gluten (they are persnickety) but I tried the product anyway since it was suggested to try oat products from the UK.  In the past 3 years I have never had any issues with the McCann line of oatmeals. The brown sugar flavor is my favorite, I make 2 packets at a time.  The unflavored slow cook kind makes great oatmeal raisin cookies too!!!
