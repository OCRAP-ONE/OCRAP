review/summary: Xyla Xylitol is a great sugar substitute! No after taste - clean & sweet
review/text: I've been using Emerald Forest Xyla Xylitol for over a year. I love this product. It has a clean, sweet taste. There is NO aftertaste whatsoever. (It's fun to taste it "raw", it's cool on the tongue.) I use xylitol in my cookie, brownie, muffin, whipped cream, and other similar type recipes. I have not used it in custards or candies. The recipes I've used xylitol in come out great - the flavor and texture are uncompromised. I most often use xylitol with rapudura sugar in my recipes. I do this because some of my friends are sensitive to xylitol's mild laxative affect. I personally don't react to xylitol in that way, but I do have a couple of friends that experience bloating after eating my brownies that have xylitol substituted for the sugar. So, now I substitute 1/2 xylitol and 1/2 rapudura sugar in my cookie and brownie recipes and my friends don't have any adverse intestinal response. (Yay!)  Also, when eating desserts with xylitol, I don't experience a "sugar headache". I have had no adverse reactions while using this product. It's a fantastic sugar substitute.

review/summary: Xylitol
review/text: I like this product but was disappointed to find that this product has 10 calories per teaspoon when other products I have purchased state they have no calories.  The taste is good without aftertaste, but sugar is only 15 calories per teaspoon, so I am not sure there is much benefit to using it in place of the better tasting dehydrated can juice or other natural sugars.

review/summary: Economical sinus flush!
review/text: I had been using the Grossan Breathe-ease Nasal Moisturizing and Irrigation Solution Kit (Double Pack) daily in an electric sinus flush machine for my chronic sinus problems. I stumbled across a home made recipe for sinus flush and decided to give it a try to save some money. Long story short, this xylitol mixed with pharmaceutical grade neti pot salt (Himalayan Institute brand) along with some baking soda gives me an even better sinus flush mix for MUCH less money. I essentially get 150 ounces of sinus flush mix for less than $60, vs 14 oz for $25 of the pre-mixed product. That's a SERIOUS amount of savings plus my nose likes this mixture better. I found the best ratio for me is: 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp baking soda and 2 tsp xylitol in a quart of water. Hope this helps someone else save money!

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I started using this in my coffee in the morning instead of sugar after my dentist said my teeth were getting bad. It's a little less sweet than sugar, but has less calories and supposedly helps prevent tooth decay. However if you're sensitive to dietary things, start slow and work your way up. I didn't have a problem, but it can cause diarrhea if you're not careful. It's also toxic to animals so make sure to clean well if spilled. I love it and prefer it to sugar in my coffee now! It also comes in a cardboard canister with a plastic lid to keep moisture out. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Zylotol products can cause instestinal problems
review/text: As far as the taste factor goes, it really is a good substitute for table sugar.  It doesn't have the aftertaste of Stevia based (also from a plant) products.  However, it can cause diarreha in some people.  I am on Metformin for very low borderline diabetes, which causes diarreha in about 50% of the people on it.  Well, when I started using this product, I had to cancel appointments and stay home for 24 hours.  It just made matters worse for me.  I believe someone else has commented on the diarreha problems with Zylotol, which I didn't notice before I bought and tried this product.

review/summary: Better than Organic Zero, not as good as Splenda
review/text: I'm still looking out for a decent replacement for Splenda since I can't buy it in the large packages from Amazon anymore.  I was hoping this stuff would do the trick, but I don't like the aftertaste.  It leaves a chemical-like taste that I don't like and can't seem to get used to.  It tastes very similar to the Organic Zero, but isn't quite as nasty.  It has the consistency of sugar and 40% of the calories, so I guess, if you could get used to the flavor, it would be OK.  I drink it in tea and I figure if it changes the taste of the beverage, then it isn't doing it's job.  I just want my cup sweetened not altered to the point where I feel like I'm drinking something else.  It tastes highly artificial.  I'd rather use saccharine than this.

review/summary: Worked for me
review/text: I had a minor mole problem in the front of my yard. I live in a sub development with kids and pets so not wanting to use toxic chemicals or lethal force unless absolutely necessary I gave this a try. I applied a heavy soaking to a 6' perimeter around my property and we have had no activity since, before using this stuff I was seeing new mole hills every few days. It was very easy to apply with the hose and made no mess. I expected an odor but it wasn't noticeable and was completely gone in 10 mins. I have no idea where the mole(s) went but I haven't seen them on my property. This would certainly be my first attempt to remove a future infestation.  My experience was with moles only, I don't know how gophers respond to this stuff.

review/summary: Great creamed coconut; NOT the same as coconut milk
review/text: The folks giving bad reviews on this product don't seem to understand that creamed coconut is not the same as condensed coconut milk. It contains coconut-meat solids and is pulpier/thicker, and will not taste like coconut milk by thinning it out with water.<br />What you get: inside the green box you see in the picture is a plastic-wrapped block of creamed coconut. Unless your house is very warm, it will be rock-hard. I fill a bowl with hot tap water and immerse the entire package, then knead it with my fingers after a few minutes. Repeat a couple of times, then snip the package open and pour/squeeze it out like toothpaste for use in cooking. If you don't use the entire package all at once it will resolidify; that's not because there's anything "wrong" with it, that's just what real coconut cream does.  That's why I love these little packages, as opposed to the 16-oz jars of other brands that they sell at Whole Foods Market.

review/summary: Strong, Flavorful Coconut Cream
review/text: This Coconut Cream has a bit of a grainy texture, which is not bad, as the cream melts easily in the mouth and leaves a strong coconut flavor. You can use it for curry dishes perfectly - just heat up the cream and blend in the spices.<br /><br />Yet, another good idea is to mix it with cacao powder and sweeten it a bit and cool it down in the fridge. You will get a chocolate with an exotic flair.<br /><br />I used to buy Coconut oil but Let's Do Organic Coconut Cream is much better for you. The latter has not only the good, healthy fats but also a lot of fiber, protein, and minerals, which the oil does not have.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they don't offer this cream in bulk or Food Service Size for the moment. As I use a lot, it would be more economical for me. I hope it will be available in bulk size again soon.

review/text: This is the same stuff that I make at home using a food processor and grinding up unsweetened dried coconut.  It takes a long time to do at home, so it is nice to buy it already done (and much cheaper than the Artisana brand).  I call it coconut butter.<br /><br />I heat up a bag in the microwave (after slitting open) and pour into a jar to remix it.  I love to put some on oats or on top of blueberry sauce.  Heck- I even eat it off a spoon.  I love the granular texture, which gives it staying power over just putting coconut oil on something.<br /><br />Since I live in a Northeast climate, I do need to soften it up in the microwave before scooping it out.

If you have digestive issues, give this product a try.<br />The consistency is creamy with bits of coconut in it and has a mild coconut flavor, not very strong but when I used it in a Thai dish, the coconut flavor came out very nicely.

review/summary: Great for IBS, IBD and crohns disease- does NOT contain carageean or guar gum which can inflame intestines
review/text: After suffering from IBD - inflammatory bowel disease for a number if years, I discovered( to my horror ) that the synthetic ingredient  Carrageean and guar gum were a major reason why i had this disorder.  Carrageean and guar gum are known carcinogens and contribute to inflammatory conditions in the intestines.  Read the report in Cornucopia.org.<br /><br />Since eliminating all foods that contained these ingredients, specifically, carrageean, my small intestine and colon have begun to heal.  For years, my doctors thought my inflammation was allergy related or wheat or gluten related - I now suspect it was the synthetic carageean  ingredient. Google the dangers of  Carrageean and you will understand how it inflames your colon and contributes to IBD, IBS, Crohns, UC and colon cancer.  the horrible ingredient is also in some milk and dairy products and pet food.  PLEASE READ all labels before buying products.<br /><br />Anyway, This coconut milk is a bit more challenging to use, yes, BUT it tastes great and you know only coconut is the ingredient so it won't inflame your gut which is more than I can say about the other coconut milks I've researched - most contain that horrible carrageean ingredient I now stay away from.  READ every label.<br /><br />Peace

review/summary: If you love coconut...
review/text: This product is like what is sold under other brand names as coconut butter or coconut manna. As mentioned by others, it comes in a plastic packet inside of the little box. If your kitchen is 76 degrees or warmer, then it will be soft. If your kitchen is cooler, it will be more firm. If you place this product in the refrigerator, it becomes very hard. That is because the coconut oil that is in it becomes solid at lower room temperatures.<br /><br />What is it good for? Personally, I could use this almost daily! You can use it in any way that you might use almond butter or peanut better (just remember it is unsalted). If you are adding it to a smoothy, you may want to add it with some ingredients that are not chilled and get it mixed in before adding frozen fruit or refrigerated items. If it is added to a very cold smoothy then it will likely not mix in. Instead it will be in little chips or chunks. These chips do melt in your mouth, so it is not a bad way to do it, just different than what you might have had before.<br /><br />My favorite way to use it is in cooking. It is a wonderful way to thicken a sauce or stew. Add a couple of tablespoons to the simmering broth and let it continue to simmer. After a minute or two you will see how it has thickened. Others here have said they used this for creamy curry dishes. I also make a cheesy sauce by adding cheddar cheese after the sauce has started to thicken. This is really wonderful with beef or chicken. I find it adds to the depth of flavor.<br /><br />As for how to handle and store this product: In the original packaging it is shelf stable. It is a good idea to soften the packet before opening. Depending on the temperature it has been stored at, the coconut oil may have separated from the rest of the product. Simply place the sealed packet in a bowl of warm tap water for a few minutes then kneed it with your fingers to mix it all together. Once the product is opened, it is still shelf stable. That is because the coconut oil in it is not prone to going rancid. I usually squeeze the product out of the plastic packet into a glass jar with a tight fitting lid and keep it in the cupboard. I have never had this go bad, even if it got lost in the cupboard and I found it months later. It has always stayed fresh.<br /><br />As for the heath benefits of coconut and coconut oil, it is easy to find this information with a search on the internet. Coconut oil is wonderful for you and your heart and your weight control. Coconut fiber is also highly beneficial. This is great stuff! And Let's Do Organic has kept the cost and waste down by offering it in this convenient packaging. I agree with the reviewer who said it would be nice if it were available in a larger size. I would buy 1-2 lbs at a time!

review/summary: Inconsistent quality
review/text: I chose creamed coconut over coconut milk or oil because this is more digestible thanks to having the full spectrum of co-factors. The reason I liked this particular brand was because 1. it was cheap 2. it came on a subscription basis 3. it was easier to use than the ridiculously inaccessible brands that come in jars (whoever thought that cruel form of packaging up for coconut cream should probably be summarily shot).<br /><br />Why am I speaking in the past tense? Because I just got a bad batch and it is awful. I define a "bad batch" as 1. having air in all of the packages 2. having a creepy rubberyness in the texture and 3. making you feel sick when you eat it. The fact that you can't return grocery items only rubs salt in the wound. That being said, it's great stuff when you can get a good batch! Just be sure to enjoy it while you can because the good times won't last.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: I started adding coconut of all different forms to my diet since learning of its health benefits, particularly as a rare source of medium-chain triglycerides and its resistance to oxidation from the heat of cooking. I also thoroughly enjoy the sweet, nutty flavor of coconut. I not only cook with coconut oil, but I add it to foods for its theoretical health benefits as well. For variety, I sometimes will use coconut butter instead. So, when I came across these 7-ounce packets of creamed coconut, and at a lower per-ounce cost, I was expecting to be pleased. Unfortunately, I must say that I dislike this product. First, the health benefits of coconut are found mostly in its oil, so the added coconut meat in this product offers very little nutritionally over the oil. Second, the coconut meat of this product makes it too sandy, producing an unpleasant mouth feel for me. Third and worst of all, this stuff requires too much effort to use. Pouring  the soft, oily product from the plastic pouches is messy. Even worse, when cooled and solidified, it becomes rock-hard. Melting it is just not worth the effort. I'll stick with coconut oil or coconut butter.

review/summary: Excellent product, good way to get caprylic acid
review/text: This is coconut butter, not coconut cream or coconut milk.  It's dried white coconut meat that's been ground to a spreadable consistency, like nut butter.  The fat in coconut solidifies at temps below 76 degrees.  So that's why most people have to warm it up to use it.  I keep it in a sealed plastic baggie and put it a bowl or sink of hot water for a few minutes to make it spreadable.<br />WHY I use it:  Coconut oil contains fatty acids that kill bacteria, viruses and fungus.  I take it to control the fungus that causes yeast infections (candida).  One tablespoon of coconut butter or oil contains one gram of caprylic acid.  That's a lot of tablets OR one tablespoon of coconut butter or oil, which I find easier to take.  It's not only helped control the candida, but I've also noticed my immune system is stronger.  I've used coconut oil for about a year, and my rate of colds/sinus infections has dropped by 80%. The one cold I did catch was much less severe and I recovered in half the time.<br />HOW I use it:  with green curry paste to make Thai dishes, or to make a white sauce with nutmeg for vegetables.  I also use it to make a creamy, sugar-free treat to take the place of the ice cream I gave up (had to give up sugar b/c it feeds candida).  I melt one tablespoon of this product, mix it into an 8 ounce serving of nonfat Greek yogurt, sweeten with your favorite sugar-free sweetener and chill.

review/text: Was shocked at the price, so I had to at least try. Have used coconut oil before so I knew it would be a solid or liquid depending on the temperature. But its exactly what it says it is. It is gritty but i expected that. It goes unnoticed in everything, except eating it straight, which I don't do. I use for baking & smoothies. Would definately recommend & I will buy again.

review/summary: Note: it's a solid that you dilute
review/text: The product comes as a hard and apparently concentrated solid. It's similar to Artisana "coconut butter." Both products are harder than butter at room temperature, so a better description might be "coconut tallow" or "coconut wax" (no offense intended, those are just what it reminds me most of). The package says to add 2 Tbsps of hot water to 1 Tbsp Creamed Coconut and stir briskly until dissolved, which was a surprise, because the product was recommended on a raw forum. Being a high raw omnivore myself I'm also not used to foods that need some heat and processing and have instructions and I figured others might be served by this warning, as I tasted some without first diluting it and that was a horrible experience.<br /><br />I followed the instructions and found it wouldn't dissolve without first breaking up the chunks into tiny bits. You can also melt the whole package contents in a bowl of hot water, as a commenter kindly explained to me. The result was still too thick, drying, and gluey and it needed more water. I added two more tablespoons and it was less bad, but I still didn't care much for it. It has a sawdust-like texture and the gritty bits stuck in my throat and the taste was unpleasant--like coconut that's been heat-dried and stored for months. Not surprisingly, the package says the product is dehydrated.<br /><br />This and the similar Artisana coconut butters are some of the least pleasant foods I've ever tried and I'm puzzled why people like them. If you care to explain why you like it, feel free to comment, because I know some people love it. For those that like this sort of product, I think they might like this one OK, so even though I would give it one star, I compromised and gave it 3. Top quality coconut water, coconut candy bars and coconut sorbet remain my favorite-tasting packaged coconut foods.

review/text: Too grainy and not a distinct coconut flavor. I was expecting a coconut milk consistency for frozen deserts, coffee and soups. Too much oil in this product to use in coffee and too grainy for soups and deserts.  It may be good for baking, but I haven't tried that as yet. I do like the fact that it is condensed and you add water to it, good packaging.

review/summary: sigh.
review/text: i was thoroughly and deeply disappointed with this 'creamed coconut' specifically for one reason:<br /><br />the back of the box says to just combine it with water and 'allow it a minute to soften.'  i just don't understand how they could write this.  i waited for a few long minutes, and it simply softened, by the tiniest bit, around the edges.  the rest, perfectly solid.  so i left it for about four hours, by which time my cake had cooled, and still, it was utterly solid.  depressing.  eventually i pureed it in the food processor... and it even then did not reach the desired consistency, but at least i could pour it over my cake and give it the mild coconut deliciousness i wished for.<br /><br />i would only recommend this product to someone who had absolutely nothing else to use, so please do not buy this if you have another option, like organic cream of coconut.  this only gained two stars from me for being organic.

review/summary: Tolerable Coffee albeit Smells like Hell
review/text: This dry coffee ground stenches of turpentine and vodka, the bag itself smelling of dogfood before it's opened.  The bag sent to me might just be aromatically individuated, but if so it's a stinky individual.  Once brewed, the coffee functions as coffee does and seems low acid for its effect on my stomach.  The pleasant effect of the low acidity might be worth the initial stench; no belly cramps nor aches occur after drinking it.  The horse flies and God Himself stay away from the grounds though, on the basis of its infernal reek.<br /><br />If you don't care how pernicious a stench the coffee grounds have before the coffee's made, this is a fine product indeed -- and it's low acid content, so it is easier on your belly.

review/summary: cost vs caution
review/text: Dog owners beware!  Although most dogs like these treats (and they are a good price for the amount you get), please use caution.  Smokehouse, a chinese exporter, was involved in the massive contaminated treat and food recalls last year.<br /><br />If you can't afford the healthier and safer free range treats (such as lamb ears, kneecaps, tendons, etc), you can instead find some great recipes to make your own dog snacks.  Or buy a Kong and shove some doggie snacks in it, or smear a dab of natural peanut butter in it... it will keep your dog busy and is good brain stimulation.<br /><br />If you absolutely must buy these Smokehouse treats, be sure to CHECK THE CONTAINER FOR BUGS.  The last one I saw had some of the most disgusting gray beetle-looking bugs crawling into and around the treats in the jar. Also, keep your empty container (or at least the label) for a couple months in case your dog does get sick.

review/summary: ****WARNING****
review/text: If you have a "gulper" please be VERY careful with this product!!!  Please supervise your pets with this treat, as the pieces are VERY small and I can see may present a choking hazard or cause internal blockage for some dogs.  I have a 14lb pooch who is a self regulator (ie. wont wolf down her food all at once, but graze here and there.) and have no issues with food or toys; meaning even if she has a nice juicy steak in her mouth, I can easily get it right out of her mouth with not even much of a protest.  She also knows the leave it command, and will drop stuff for me to get away from her.<br /><br />Despite those facts, I am still pretty leery of given her these..."just in case."  But my dog is my baby... so she only gets it when I am right there with her and can supervise, and I make sure she is actually chewing them.<br /><br />The variety is nice, and the smell isnt as bad as some bull's stick, or hooves or whatever on the market.  Also, the ingredients are all natural, which is important to me.<br /><br />However, I worry too much about the pieces being so small....so despite the fact that she likes 'em (she is a very picky eater.) This will probably be the one and only time I will purchase this product.

review/text: My first hint that I might not be re-ordering was the caution on the package to "wash hands with soap and water" after handling the treats. I've never seen that before. Hmm. The things inside the container looked like some kind of circus side-show of the treat world. They smell strange, and look like butcher-store offal.<br /><br />I understand that dog treats come from the discarded parts of animals, but this product makes it very clear that these are nowhere near what we normally think of as "food." There were some bits (unidentifiable) that the dog would not eat, though she would eat most of them. She doesn't seem to be any more enthusiastic about these than any other kind of treat, though.<br /><br />And I don't like carrying a few in my pocket on walks, because some are great big tube-like things and some are tiny stick pieces. And of course then I spend the whole walk wanting to wash my hands. It's just a strange, creepy assortment, and I don't think I'll be getting this product again.

review/summary: My dogs and sister love these things.
review/text: My dogs love these things.  Alas, so does my sister.  I had four of them on the kitchen cabinet when she made one of her unannounced and unwanted visits.  With out asking, she grabbed one, ate it and loved it.  I was tempted to stop her, but let her finish off the other three.  The dogs looked at her rather oddly as they are a bit brighter than she is.  Hmmm, perhaps I could use them to house break her....you know, treats for doing right and all that!  Just a thought.  Anyway, even if you do not have an obnoxious sister, the dogs will live these things anyway.  I think I will wait for the next family gathering to break the news to her.

review/text: My dogs love it, but it looks like the leftovers from other products that they just jumbled together and packaged. I mean, on one hand, it cuts down on waste, but on the other hand, its kind of disappointing when you get the treats and actually see how they are. Not so good for Big Dogs, especially gobblers, since they might choke on the small pieces.

review/text: My dog loves this.  She's a tiny toy fox that's gone through tubs of them already.  Only thing is there seems to be no consistancy in what is in the tub.  I guess they make different sets of batches so sometimes when I order I would get chicken balls in the variety and other times I would get something else instead.  Never the less my dog still loves it.

review/text: This is an absolutely awesome product!  I first ran across it at a local pet shop and my dog went nuts for these assorted treats.  I then couldn't find them at any local pet stores so I had to come to amazon to get them.  I will be ordering these for many years to come as it is my dogs absolute favorite treats (and I have tried them all, trust me).  Very good dollar value too at only $6.99 for a 1 pound tub.  I don't order the 3 lb tub because you get more of a variety in the 1 lb (yeh I know it doesn't sound right, but its what I have noticed).  Try them and you won't be disappointed!

review/text: Beware of this product--I always shop on Amazon and figured why not get my dogs something--well these were cheap and seemed like such a good price for a big supply of treats---and if you are buying dog treats, you know how expensive they can be....well, I don't have 100% proof that the treats did this to my dog, but the week I was giving these to my lab and to my other dog, a maltese, the lab was getting sick throughout the week--throwing up, etc....I don't know if he was not eating them properly--maybe he wasn't chewing them all the way up, but he doesn't always chew up food and doesn't throw it up---I don't know--I hate to blame these treats, but when we stopped giving them to him, he stopped throwing up---so I think something was wrong w/them.....just use caution--a cheap price isn't all that cheap when your dog gets sick and you spend 3x as much on cleaning products to clean up your house!!  My maltese didn't seem to be bothered by them, but then again he really didn't eat but maybe one of them---another sign that something must have been wrong w/them as he eats ANYTHING!!!

review/summary: How Great is this Butter?
review/text: This peanut butter is so good! It goes directly from jar to spoon to mouth. If you're used to eating JIF or Skippy, this will be a different experience. First off, when you first open a jar, you'll have to stir it a little. I find that I only stir it one upon opening, and I don't have to stir it again... until I pop open a new jar. This peanut butter is smooth, creamy, perfectly sweet, and totally delicious. You can really taste the honey!!! And the peanut flavor is so fresh. I made a sandwich for my fiance who has been using Skippy for years. He said that you can't really compare the two. It's like comparing McDonalds to gourmet food. But this tastes more natural and somehow... healthier. I'm doing to keep using this. Maybe I'll bake with it some day. For now, I'm happy to eat it from the jar or if I'm feeling "fancy" I'll make a PB&J sandwich.

review/text: I would give this PB 10 stars if I could.  So far I've tasted Bees Knees, Dark Chocolate Dreams, and White Chocolate Wonderful, and they're all spectacular.  But then, I love PB so much I could eat it every day for the rest of my life, so....<br /><br />If you're the type (and I certainly am) to put 2 tbsp of PB and 1 tbsp of honey on a sandwich, then this actually saves you a significant number of calories.  190 + 60 = 250 calories, but 2 tbsp Bees Knees = 180 calories.  I'm practically rabid when I'm around PB and honey, but I don't miss honey at all when I eat this stuff.  It's probably worth it financially to buy the 6 pack if you love PB and/or have little self control, because this jar will not last as long as you think it will :)  Mine lasted....3 days I think?

review/text: It bothers me that if you search Amazon for Organic Peanut Butter, this shows up at the top of the search results. It is NOT organic. Why do I care? Because peanuts can be a very high pesticide and carcinogenic-laced product; and I eat it every day.<br />I convinced myself that because the product page says "certified kosher, vegan, and is even gluten-free" that it was just an oversight that they didn't include the organic term in the description since it showed up so high in my search results. I bought a 6-pack, and thankfully Amazon refunded my purchase, but it doesn't change the fact that this is still showing up in the 'organic' search results.<br />I realize it's my own fault...but I still feel a bit duped and hoping to help anyone else looking for organic peanut butter.

review/text: We are trying to eliminate preservative and ingredients like high fructose corn syrup.  I decided on this peanut butter.  The ingredients are peanuts, evaporated cane juice, honey, natural honey flavor, palm fruit oil and salt.  There is no HFCS and no hydrogenated oils.  As far as the evaporated cane juice, it is not refined sugar and retains the nutrients (think sugar in the raw).  It does have a little bit gritty of a taste but is wonderful!

review/summary: Too Sweet not a creamy texture
review/text: I bought this at the supermarket since it's more natural than some of the other mainstream brands expecting for it to be tastier, but apparently I like the major brand's creamy smooth peanut butter better.<br /><br />I thought it was personally TOO sweet, and it wasn't smooth and creamy because of all the crunchy little granules of what I can assume is salt since the ingredients did not list sugar.  I do not like those crunches/shatterings of the granules in what is suppose to be a smooth peanut butter - it just messes with my expectations.  Too bad because now I have an almost full jar of uneaten peanut butter

review/text: Beware:  Once you try this peanut butter, you will never go back.  I tell people it's like crack and I'm not kidding :)<br /><br />On a serious note, I blame a coworker for my addiction.  She made me try it on a toasted english muffin, and life changed from that moment on.  I'm a peanut butter fan but never had it with honey, like this.  It's delicious, easy to spread, no oily like those 'other' brands.<br /><br />Not many stores in my area carry it (and I'm just 10 miles north of Boston, it's not like I live in the boonies lol).  There was one store 10 miles from me that had it, so I would drive there to get it.  Then - sob! - suddenly they stopped carrying it!  I tried many other places, my coworker went on a search as well, we couldn't find the crack oooops I mean peanut butter ANYWHERE, which is why I resorted to buying it online.  And thanks Amazon for such a great deal too!<br /><br />I tried the Skippy brand with honey, no comparision to The Bee's Knee's!

review/summary: Tastes Very Good, But...
review/text: I tried this peanut butter for the first time yesterday.  It is very tasty, not too sweet and has a nice honey flavor.  But it isn't very smooth, it has a grainy texture.  I wonder if the honey has crystallized.  I have sensitive teeth, and maybe I got a jar that is overly granular for some reason.  But every bite I took, it felt like I was munching on coarse sugar crystals or sand.  I gather from other reviews that this either is unnoticed by or doesn't bother most people, but for me I found it to be too grainy in an unpleasant way.<br /><br />I really enjoy the taste of this pb, but I wish it was smoother.  I might try another jar in the future to see if it is the same.  I also wish it didn't contain palm oil.  I've been trying to eat less of that, and it seems almost every product today contains it.<br /><br />Update-I tried another jar and it was a lot better.  Not as crystallized.

There's just a little puffed rice in there too, which I also think adds an nice additional texture. But what I like best about these is that when you're eating one you know you're eating a date and walnut bar. There's not such a high proportion of any of the other ingredients that you feel like they begin to compete with the two main ingredients, they simply complement them very well. I try to keep one in my purse for emergencies (although I could happily eat one even if it wasn't an emergency). And finally, they're gluten free which some of my friends appreciate.

review/summary: At least they are fresh this time
review/text: It's a bit of a freshness gamble when purchasing Kind Bars from Amazon.  This time though, this box was satisfactory, as they should always be.

review/summary: Delicious and healthy!
review/text: I love these bars, which aren't carried in most places that sell Kind bars for some reason.  In my opinion, the best of the bunch -- sweet dates, tender walnuts.  They're a great snack.  Yum!

review/summary: The best bar ever invented!!
review/text: First off, the KIND brand is fabulous. These bars in particular though are my ultimate favorite. They are chock full of natural nutrition and oh so decadent tasting. The walnut-date combo is outstanding. Also, Amazon sells them the cheapest I've ever seen.

review/summary: Pricey but Delicious
review/text: My favorite is the Walnut and Date -- even though it's a little pricey at 11 dollars for 8 bars, it is a great, healthy, treat and I will definitely be purchasing again.  I like substituting it for breakfast or a  mid afternoon snack.  Seems to satisfy the hunger for a couple of hours.

review/text: I love KIND bars because they are nutrient dense (no wasted calories), tasty and filling. This variety, with dates, is perfect for mid-morning, with coffee.

review/summary: One of my favorite bars, and I'm particular.
review/text: I've been purchasing these bars for quite awhile either via Amazon or at one of the grocery stores I shop at.  Given their usual price, I always have to convince myself that I could find something less expensive but I know the nutritional quality won't come close to a bar like the KIND Walnut & Date.  I run and do quite a bit of cardiovascular work @ the gym, these bars are always a great calorie dense source of energy for me either the day before as a pre-workout source of energy or post-workout nutritional supplement.  I particularly like the Walnut & Date for the taste but also because it's one of the lower calorie bars the company offers.  Great choice!
