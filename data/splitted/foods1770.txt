review/summary: Coffee Mate is a perfect mate for your coffee!
review/text: I used to use milk in my coffee.  Then lactose intolerance kicked in big time. Coffee Mate to the rescue!  I prefer it to (lactose free) milk and any of the generic brands of nondairy creamers, all of which I have tried and no longer buy.  Use the liquid version of Coffee Mate if you like to chill your coffee down a tad.  I prefer the powder, it keeps the coffee hotter for a little longer.  I turned friends onto Coffee Mate when they used the generic versions of it.  They say and I agree that there is a huge taste difference between Coffee Mate and generic brands.  I also think it tastes better than Creamora

review/text: As coffee creamers go, Coffee Mate is simply the best out there in my book.  Yes, there are cheaper store creamers available, but none provides the richness that Coffee Mate does.  The old adage that you get what you pay for applies...  Having this twelve-pack available through Amazon's subscribe and save program is an excellent value that I'm thrilled to find available.  No sales tax and free shipping makes it that much better of a value.  Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: all right by me !!!
review/text: Coffee-mate makes for an excellent milk or cream substitute for people who want a cup of coffee, cocoa or even tea when they don't have access to a refrigerator to keep milk or cream on hand. Coffee-mate therefore comes in very handy in many workplaces, naturally, but you just might wind up using this instead of milk or cream even if you do have access to a refrigerator with milk or cream in it!<br /><br />Coffee-mate is easy enough to use--just add three or four teaspoons full of it into your cup of coffee, tea or whatever beverage you want.<br /><br />I would use Coffee-mate by the expiration date on the bottom of the plastic container; and the container gives you simple instructions for turning this powdery substance into liquid just in case you want to do that.<br /><br />The nutrition label claims it contains no trans-fats but I notice that it contains partially hydrogenated oils. This may indicate that the trans-fats in Coffee-mate are present but very negligible.<br /><br />Have further questions? Just give them a call or surf on over to their website. They provide you with the website address and a toll free number if you have more questions about vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate.<br /><br />Overall, Coffee-mate provides an excellent, mildly sweet tasting substitute for milk, cream and anything else that contains lactose. You may want to use it to sweeten your coffee, tea or cocoa even if you have access to fresh refrigerated milk that you can use. It's THAT good.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!

review/summary: FANTASTIC TASTE
review/text: Great Product!  Got the Regular Chicory flavor first and liked it so much I ordered this.  It's a little expensive but well worth it.  I sometimes add  teaspoon to my regular coffee and it makes it so rich tasting and adds better coffee depth of flavor to it.  When you store it, you have to put saran wrap on the jar then screw the top on it and it's lasted much longer than the three months recommended

review/summary: Perfect Stocking Stuffer
review/text: I purchased this as a stocking stuffer, and was really curious as to the size of it.  As soon as I opened the package, I busted out laughing.  It's at least the size of my hand, if not larger.  Whoever said this tastes bad must have received a bad one, because this one tastes just like the small version we all know and love.<br /><br />The packaging was perfect, and came wrapped in clear cellophane taped at the the base.  No damage whatsoever in transit - in a sturdy USPS box filled with styrofoam peanuts.  I would be cautious about ordering it during a hot time of year if it has to be left outdoors for any length of time.<br /><br />I'm happy to say this was a hit, and I will definitely purchase it again next holiday season!

review/text: Product was advertised as Porcini Powder.  The product that we received was labelled 'Dried Mushroom Powder.' It looked greyish rather than the richer cinnamon-brown color of porcini powders that I have purchased in the past from another company.  More importantly, tasted/smelled like "watered down" porcini, not 100% porcini.  Looks like a 'bait and switch' to me and we will definitely not order again.

review/text: Very happy with this powder. I sue it when I want to add richness to soups, stocks, stews, whatever. A little bit adds a subtle amount of umami and richness (not necessarily identifiable by most as mushroom flavor), and if you use more the mushroom flavor is more pronounced. It doesn't take much to really enhance whatever you put it in.

Much to my surprise, what was delivered was not "Hazelnut Cream" -- which other reviewers have noted is the best of all flavors -- but just plain "Hazelnut," which tastes like a mix of liquified dirt and bitters.<br /><br />In short, do not expect Hazelnut Cream -- you will be getting "Hazelnut," which tastes horrendous.

review/summary: Amazing Midnight Moon Goat Cheese
review/text: This cheese will have you "hooked" from the first bite.  Expensive - around $25 per pound, but worth every penny.  First sampled this cheese at Whole Foods and bought like 1/4 lb.  Now I buy it by the "pound".  It is amazing to have with a nice dark red wine.  The cheese has a buttery flavor with a slight grainy texture.  Some say this is because of the salt content and some say it is from the aging.  It doesn't matter...I think this is what sets this cheese apart from the others.  I make sure I always have some in the house.  Have to admit (I do not share this one with company - lol).  This is something you will want to hoard just for yourself - enjoy!

I just ate some with plain crackers (wish I had a baguette from Rooster Brother in Ellsworth) and a Ginger Gold apple.  I can see putting shavings of it on top of a salad with some sliced pear.

The outside is not as cakey as a Newton, more substantial but certainly not cookie-ish.  All in all a great snack or dessert.

review/summary: Perfect with a glass of milk!
review/text: Betty Lou's Gluten Free Fruit Bars (Strawberry) have been such an argument saver for us. Our son is 8 years old, diabetic and gluten intolerant. Because he is diabetic (Type 1) he must take his insulin 3 times per day, at fairly regular times each day, or his blood sugars get out of whack. It's sort of a catch 22, though, because in order to take the insulin he must eat- 4 servings of carbs (or 60 grams). These bars a delicious option for times when he just isn't hungry for a full meal. They are not too filling, taste great, and pack 3 servings of carbohydrates (approx 45 grams) each. Add a 10 oz glass of milk and he's got his 4th serving of carbohydrates and a source of protein to keep him going until his next snack or meal time. I feel good knowing they have real fruit filling and are gluten free. He feels like he's getting a little "dessert" for lunch (which is a special treat for him). It's a win for everyone.

review/text: I've been gluten free for over 3 years now and miss certain things: a doughy pizza crust, soft sandwich bread and a newton type cookie.  Doughy pizza dough has eluded me and I've almost found that soft bread (Udi's comes dang close to the bread I remember).<br /><br />Now finally I've found a fruit cookie that reminds me of a Newton (actually more similar to a Nutrigrain Bar but still in the same family).<br /><br />I like the texture of the cookie to this bar.  It doesn't taste gluten free at all!  I also like the amount of fruit filling and the tangy taste.  It's not overly sweet.  I also like that it's fruit sweetened so I feel less guilty eating it.<br /><br />The bar is small, not gonna lie.  But it's also very filling.  I ate the first one thinking I would not be satisified but I was.<br /><br />When I'm in a rush in the morning, I can slam down one of these out the door and feel full until lunchtime.  I'm going to order different flavors and see what I like best.

review/text: My teenage son and I are both GF, and we're always trying whatever new GF products we can find. Some have been terrific, and some...not so much. These bars definitely fall into the latter category. Besides being chewy in an odd, unpleasant way, there was a VERY strong and persistent aftertaste. We tried all three flavors and had similar results with each. I would suggest trying to find them locally to try first (our regional grocery store carries them) before buying a whole box through Amazon.

I wonder why of all the gluten-free flours out there this company chooses barley flour which is not gluten-free?  I did some research on this and found that barley flour does contain gluten.  Surely I am missing something here as to why this product is marketed as gluten-free.  Perhaps the company can explain.  The bars sound really good and I love strawberry.

review/summary: Lame popcorn
review/text: I just told my wife that I was going to review the 4 pounds of popcorn that we bought, and she suggested the following title: "sucky suck suck suck."  That pretty much sums it up.<br /><br />This popcorn doesn't pop well, and when it does, it tastes only half popped.  Compared to Orville Redenbacher, it only pops up to about 1/3 - 1/2 of the volume.

review/summary: Good product, flimsy packaging
review/text: We use air popped popcorn to replace microwave popcorn after finding out that microwave popcorn is loaded with nasty chemicals. We've orded this product before and it came in a plastic jar with a screw top. Since this product was no longer available on Amazon, we ordered the bags. Shipping was very fast but one of the four bags was broken and my popcorn became the "popcorn" used for packaging material. I barely started to open another bag and the plastic came apart, spilling corn in my kitchen.<br /><br />Just beware there is some risk in ordering the popcorn in the plastic bags.

review/summary: Not too bad
review/text: This popcorn pops up evenly and has a good texture when I use it with my air popper.  It's got a nice flavor that isn't overwhelmingly "corny" and leaves very, very few kernels unpopped.  Would give it five stars, but I feel the quality is so similar to other more popular store bought popcorn that I might recommend just buying that since it's going to be much cheaper.

review/summary: Full bodied, strong fruity aroma, excellent Sicilian oil
review/text: Today I tried this oil for the first time, and I am swished away by its wonderful fruitiness. What a great aroma! Unbelievable!<br /><br />I had toasted bread slices which I rubbed with a raw clove of garlic, the toasted bread works like a grater here. I use it very generously, so one clove lasts only for 2 slices in my household. Upon this prepared bread I am putting only the best olive oils.<br /><br />I am changing them, actually. I had started this kind of breakfast some weeks ago, and so far we had used some milder oil from Tuscany. Now it was time to try one of our newly ordered Gustiamo oils, and I went with this one, as their blog post about it and the man behind it had made me already curious.<br /><br />This guy is my kind of guy, I am of a similar mindset and no less cynical than he is. Organic labels have become useless, since every industrial corporation can plaster their garbage products with them nowadays. DOP in Italy is no longer a garantee for outstanding quality. So why bother and run with the masses, why spending much money to get such a useless label on your product? As long as you know your product is outstanding and great, you will be able to convince your customers, with DOP labels or not.<br /><br />His oil is indeed outstanding! Good that I bought 2 bottles of it.<br /><br />Strong flavour, green, tart and fruity at the same time. Could I mention I was reminded of citrus? There are certainly no flavours added, I only felt a hint of citrus in the aroma and the rich full bodied taste. I will definitely re-order this Queen of Sicilian oils!

review/text: Although I adore all of Gustiamo's olive oils, this one takes me back to the olive groves where it is pressed every time I use it in a dish. It's delicate, fruity and extremely pure in taste, as if you were plucking an olive from the tree and sucking the juices out right there and then. It adds elegance to anything - for example I enjoy using it on simple dishes such as tuna carpaccio, sea salt, and capers. Buy and pour over everything for a fresh and original Italian taste!

review/summary: Great Convenience- watch dosage
review/text: This is a great product but I highly recommend using 1/2 vial then waiting an hour or two to consume the second half.  Now I'm only 136 lbs so for a larger person it may not be an issue.  But my body was apparently not able to absorb 40-50g of whey protein at one time.  My body seemed to not be able to absorb all it it efficiently and it resulted in gas and Montezuma showed up!  After using them for a few weeks it got to where I could absorb them better once my body was more used to this type of protein.  Like I said I'm not saying this will be an issue for anyone else.  It could simply be that my body is smaller than average.  I still use them in 2 doses just assuming my body can use the protein more efficiently that way.

review/text: Tetley's is a very old British brand that used to be much more easier to find stateside that it is today. Thankfully we have amazon to fulfill our needs.<br /><br />Tetley's is a nice light, well balanced, "English tea" that I have been pleasantly surprised about. While its no Barry's Gold Blend, its an excellent tea for afternoons (I prefer lighter tea in the afternoon and evening) compared to my breakfast choice of Barry's. If you prefer your tea English instead of Irish (lighter flavor, the Irish prefer very bold and strong tea), this could very easily be your one stop shop for your 'stable black'.

review/summary: No flavor, considering the name and ingredients
review/text: I have had many ginger teas in my life, and the best I would have to say is fresh ginger root ground. Considering this tea is marketed as "ginger peach" and the ingreadients state: : black tea, flavor, ginger root, there is no ginger flavor and the "flavor" in the ingredients does not seem to be peach. The brewing instructions state "one level teaspoon of leaves per 8oz of water". This ratio gave it a watery flavor, and doubling the ratio did not improve flavor. The best way to describe the flavor in "my" opinion is that the tea tastes like my grandma's perfume smells...not the best. I would bet that other teas made by this company don't all taste this way, but this flavor does not meet my expectations for being called a "ginger tea".

I want to note however, that there is a fault in their advertising.  I ordered the Delacre Prestige "Luxury"...Assortment and also the Delacre Prestige "Elegant"...Assortment.  When my package arrived today I received 2 of the "Luxury" Assortments. Upon calling the shipper I was told that there really wasn't any difference in the two, despite the difference in prices?  He went on to give me an explanation I didn't understand as it made no sense.  So if you are looking for two different Assortments to try, keep in mind that "Luxury and Elegant" are the same thing.  Otherwise, ENJOY!<br />Sincerely, Pam

review/summary: Sold by Dishonest Foods
review/text: I keep getting Amazon emails with these coins listed - presumably because I was recently searching for Chocolate Gold Coins to use in my wedding. The problem I have is that the title blatantly states that these coins are "Only $0.09 Each!" which is a blatant lie no matter how you swing it. Let's do the math, currently a bag of 465 coins is listed at about $70.00. Assuming that is the gross cost of the product, $70.00 divided by 465 coins is just a fraction of a cent over $0.15/coin. But wait - the seller also charges a grossly inappropriate $18.95 to ship the coins. This brings the total for the entire bag to $88.95 or a fraction of a cent over $0.19/coin - which is MORE THAN DOUBLE THE PRICE that "Honest Foods" is advertising in the product's title and description.<br /><br />Honest? I think not. I'll buy my coins from someone who doesn't lie to my face.

The company quickly responded and reassured me when I emailed them to make sure the chocolate was safe to eat, after some coins (different brand) had been recalled that had been made in China.

review/text: I just like bread that is natural, gives you something to chew and not bite off a piece sqeeze it between toung and gum and swollow it. The chewing process is so important to the whole digestive procedure. Besides that the bread also has NO preservatives and still stocks very well. My kind of bread, I LOVE IT SO DOES MY FAMILY.<br />(...)

This is an excellent product.  Very tasty, high-quality bread.  It comes in small packets, 4" X 3" X 1-1/2 and thankfully is pre-sliced.  I can certainly recommend that you give it a try.

review/text: If you like dark rye European pumperknickle, this is about as good as you can get for the price. It is much less expensive than comparable supermarket prices.  Made in Germany. Pasteurized in heavy wrap for long life and fresh taste. 3 grams of fiber per piece with 60 calories.  Great with cheese, dips, etc. Great smell and taste.

Try it with smoked salmon and cream cheese or make an avocado and turkey sandwich. Also toasting it for a few minutes will soften it a bit.

I love this small package better cause it fits better in the toaster. I love that it go bad in you do not fridge it.one can see the whole grains and it tastes very good with cheese...salad... guacamole..etc<br /><br />Editing my review....cause i broke 2 teeth cause the stones in the bread. When I broke 1 tooth - ok, natural grains, might one stone sneaked in it...but now I broke second tooth... you know it cost a lot of discomfort and money to fix the tooth...

All the Geeta brands we have tried  - we have tried many - are excellent quality. The condiment matches well with fish, beef, rice, chicken, curry or even on toast. Bon Appetite!

Shipped much quicker from this company than the other ones I ordered from a different company!! Keep a close eye on the jerky type, she loves them but she almost choked on one..so watch them if you give them the jerky type! These sticks go much quicker, but are soft and not as chewy as the jerky type.

review/summary: Milder than most of the bold flavors with a slight  zing of lime citrus flavor!
review/text: These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!

review/summary: Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?
review/text: These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. "BOLD" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure!

review/text: I love these Blue Diamond Almond snacks and I particularly like the bold flavors.  This flavor is very good and the smoky BBQ taste just sets off the flavor of the crunchy almond that it coats.

The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away.<br /><br />This is a very good product and I recommend it to you!

review/text: Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.<br /><br />The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!  Just make sure that you only count our 28 almonds and eat one portion for 170 calories.  It is really hard to do and they taste so darn good!

(Mostly they are the good stuff)  If you want a quick snack that is high in protein and low in sugar and sodium these are pretty good and spicy.<br /><br />While there are other flavors that I like more this one is still very good.  Just remember, they are addictive so you only get one serving!

review/text: I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I've never seen the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor at the local grocery store so when I saw them on Amazon I decided to buy them.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. This is right up there with my favorite flavors. It has just enough heat and jalapeno flavor with just a little bit of smoke. To me, these have almost as much heat as the Habanero flavor. Which isn't a bad thing. I like spicy.<br /><br />I would defiantly recommend these if you like the Bold line of Blue Diamond Almonds.

review/summary: Not habanero-y at all, but still insanely addicting
review/text: The heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help. These are not like that. Only occasionally will you get a little kick. It's actually mostly tangy and tomato-y. The dusting of flavoring on the outside of the nuts will coat your fingers in an orange film.<br /><br />Satisfyingly crunchy and tangy, it's really hard to stop eating these. Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving. High in Vitamin E (35%) and magnesium (20%). This 1 pound bag (x3 bags) is a great deal compared to buying the 6 oz tins at the store, however, when my local Walgreens has buy 1 get 1, the price drops to about $0.35/oz.<br /><br />Blue Diamond makes about 8 other flavors that I know of. My favorites are the Soy Wasabi, Honey Roasted, Smokehouse, Dijon Mustard.

Its a nice balance.<br /><br />I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom.

review/summary: Best flavor and best price of any Blue Diamond almonds!
review/text: The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting. They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering. Compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable.

review/summary: Perfect Treat - Perfect Heat
review/text: I was concerned that these might be too hot, 'Habanero', but the heat is perfect as is the flavor... they are bold, if you like stuff plain--these are not for you... but if you like a robust flavor, a definite must!  Took some to the office and my office is all addicted by these now, you can't eat just one.  From a texture perspective, they are perfectly roasted - not chewy and not powdery, they are crisp.  I'm on a Paleolithic 'Paleo' diet and nuts like these are okay for me to eat - so they make a great treat.  I've gone through 7 bags in 3 months (sharing, of course)... I definitely recommend.

review/summary: INCREDIBLE TASTE
review/text: This is the best product Blue Diamond sells, at least in my book. Spicy bbq flavor, like eating chips, but a much healthier alternative. You will not be sorry for buying these. I order these all the time, great deal on 3 pkg of 1 lb bags. YUM  PS:I am on atkins in the maintenance mode and miss chips, this is the replacement I was looking for: Far less carbs.

review/summary: Highly addictive! Great with beer
review/text: I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!

review/summary: WOW! Smoky With A Nice Slow Burn
review/text: The taste is perfect. Smoky with just enough heat to let you know it is there. These don't have 5 alarm heat if that's what you are looking for. These almonds are perfectly seasoned and very addicting. Great if you are on a ketogenic or low carb diet.

review/summary: Wasabi Lovers Rejoice! These Wasabi SoySauce Blue Diamond Almonds Taste Fantastic!!
review/text: Hello everyone, I just had to write a review for these Wasabi and Soy Sauce flavored Blue Diamond Almonds, because I enjoy them sooooooo much! I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond. The flavor is fantastic, as it is spicy but not so much to bring tears to your eyes. Also, the price of this product is great as well. Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving. Treat yourself to these awesome almonds today!
