review/text: This beef jerky is VERY sweet, like candy sweet. Two of the four packages were very fatty as well. If you like sweet beef jerky, then you will probably like this, if not try another brand. It wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't buy it again either.

review/summary: great protein source for my veggie eater!
review/text: my 6 yr old daughter's diet seriously lacks in the meat dept.  but she goes absolutely NUTSO for this smokehouse beef jerky.  i buy the 10 packs so that she can take them to school with her as a snack.  but the 10 pack never survives an entire week.  i tried to hide a pack last time for myself but she sniffed it out and sure enough it was gone when i went to eat it.  and when i take these up to our camp in the summer?  the kids fight over them - and the adults sit and hope that there's enough left for some of us to split :)  the smokehouse flavor is the BEST (though i'm also a fan of original and teriaki)

review/summary: Nice flavor, much better than other jerky brands we've tried.
review/text: We like a good beef jerky, so after reading all the positive reviews for this beef jerky, We thought we'd give it a try.<br /><br />The pros:<br />+  The flavor is smokey & on the sweet side, which my son & I thought was very good!<br />+  A good mixture of large & small pieces.<br /><br />The cons:<br />-  After a flavor filled beef jerky chew, I ended up with a rubbery, flavorless wad that couldn't be eaten.  This didn't happen every time, but it happened too many times for me.  Oddly, this didn't seem to bother my son, who's a very picky eater?<br /><br />Update:<br />After trying a couple other brands of beef jerky, my son asked me to buy this brand again.  Because of this, I've upgraded this review from 3 stars to 4 stars.  I'd like to give this jerky a higher score, but getting those occasional rubbery pieces makes me think 4 out of 5 is a fair score.

review/summary: Great crust
review/text: I can't argue with the other reviewers if the description truly labeled this as gluten free. But "graham" reflers to flour from wheat, which leads me to think one should have questioned any "gluten free" claim. This "graham" crust is delicious. It works with all of my easy crust pie recipes and has no ingredients I don't want my family to eat. It comes wrapped well and in perfect shape. My local health food store only carries this crust periodically, so I am truly grateful to Amazon for having it available to me when I need it.

review/summary: My Twin Boys Love the Game!
review/text: We have several board games but this is the one that they always want to play all the time. I love the original Clue but I thought this Jr. version would prepare them for that. I think it's doing its job. They are having fun with it and getting the idea of finding out who did what, with what, and at what time. Their dad finds it lame and wants me to get the original CLUE (of course, we're way too big for this game); but I bought it for them, not for us. Our kids are enjoying it and we are bonding as a family (with their little sister trying to grab the pieces). Now I know that they understand and are interested in the concept of "WHODUNNIT" kind of game, we are ready to move on to the next CLUE. Thanks.

review/summary: Deceptive labeling
review/text: These pickles are pickled in acetic acid even though the label in English reads brine in large print implying that they are pickled in brine. The can's small print (which is NOT visible in the picture) does report the truth. The use of brine instead of vinegar as a pickling agent results in a tremendous difference in taste. I'm stuck with 12 cans of pickles in vinegar (acetic acid). Vinegar pickles I can get anywhere, and besides I hate the taste of vinegar pickles.I bought these on the strength of the large printed brine on the can. Do NOT buy this brand if you want brined pickles. As vinegar pickles go these are no worse than others of their type.

review/summary: Square shaped pieces of meat not agreeable with all cats!
review/text: I purchased 'Natural Balance 3-Ounce Platefuls Indoor Mackerel and Sardine Formula in Gravy Entree for Cats', but no where was it advertised that the food comes in large square shaped pieces of meat.  I don't know if all their cat food varieties comes in this large square shape or not, but my cats prefer to eat ground meat or meat that comes as a 'pate'.  The Squares of mackerel & sardines are very big and all my cats do is to lick out all the gravy and leave behind most of these squares of food. When you purchase fancy feast cat food, they pretty much tell you what the form of the food is like inside of the can.  So does 9-lives, but unfortunately, 'Natural Balance' did not say this at all.  I recall purchasing mackerel by 'Merrick' as they put in their food actual pieces of 'mackerel' as they come off the fish itself just as 'Petite Cuisine' has flakes of fish in them also.  This my cat loves! But this is not the case with Natural Balance.  It's like the consistency of the meat that you eat when you're eating a 'Gyro'.  I guess my cats are too lazy to chew them, and so I'm stuck with them, as I purchased a case of 24.  I have 3 cats that are indoor cats and one cat that I feed only outdoors because he's feral.<br />Not even my feral cat and his buddy will eat it.  They too just lick out the gravy!<br />Natural Balance is not sold in my neighborhood.  If they were I would have tried out a packet first.  I'm sure that they are a very healthy food, and this food also has a few bits of vegetables in them which my cat did eat since the vegetables appear very small in size.  I was so sure that they were going to be a hit! I'm afraid that I'm a bit disappointed.

review/text: My kitty eats all the flavors of Natural Balance Platefulls on rotation, and loves all of them equally. He gets dry food in the morning, and a pouch for dinner every night. His coat is GORGEOUSLY soft and shiny, and these pouches don't give him nasty gas or rowdy bad breath like some other canned/pouch foods. When I first opened a pouch, I saw that it had peas and carrots in it, and I figured those would be left behind in the bowl. Cats just...don't eat vegetables. To my surprise, the bowl was licked clean! And after 3 months, he still licks the bowl clean every night!

I can't identify the taste, but it ties for the worst tea I have ever tasted.  I find it odd since other reviewers have commented on how good it is with a real good mango flavor.  I don't know if I'm willing to try this again.  Others who have tasted it agree with my opinion and are unwilling to drink any more of it.

review/summary: incredible. Able to replace NSAID with this supplement
review/text: I could not recommend this product more highly. I have a 12 year old german shepherd who suffers with arthritis. Our vet had prescribed Meloxicam, an NSAID. However, that category of drugs carries significant risks (ulcer formation as well as kidney or liver damage or failure). In my companion's case, it caused an ulcer even though I gave him Pepcid before each dose of Meloxicam.<br /><br />A store owner recommended this product, and within less than one week, there was so much improvement I was able to completely discontinue the NSAID, and my dog is now even better than he was when he was on the NSAID medication.<br /><br />Please note though that this is not the best concentration for large breed dogs. I learned that Liquid Health's 'L-5000' is designed for large dogs and is more highly concentrated. It too, is extremely effective.<br /><br />I strongly urge the use of this supplement before resorting to medications that can cause serious to fatal internal damage.<br /><br />My dog also finds it palatable, and I have not had any trouble feeding it to him, I just mix it in with his kibbles twice daily.

Had him x-rayed and could find nothing wrong they put him on anti-flamitories and after a few days he stop limping then maybe 3 weeks to a month later i would see him limping again. Not that often but he would limp occasionally. First time i tried this stuff i payed way to much for it at a pet store now i buy it online for almost half the price. I haven't seen him limp since he's been on the stuff. He did how ever hurt his leg again playing really rough outside. I could tell the way he was walking and not puttin wieght on it that he had injured it again. It didn't bother him near ass bad though. Before the end of the day he wasn't limping any more. I can really tell this stuff works. I've tried lot and lots of supplements, especially glucosamibne and chondroitin sumpplements the "K9 Liquid Health" by far works faster and better than any i've ever used with my dogs.

review/text: I have an 11 year old husky mix who started having problems jumping and some difficulty walking. He was on a strong pain killer for over a year and it did ok for the first six months or so, but then it started to loss it's effectiveness. I started to give him Glucosimine Chondroitin tablets and that help a lot. However, giving it to him myself was hard and I didn't always place it just right in his throat so he could shallow it comfortably (2 large tablets a day). I then began to look for something in a liquid form and I found this product and it has turned my boy into a puppy again. It's easy on him and myself and the results are far better than I could have ever hoped for! I have a "save and subscribe" shipment coming every month now.

After a few days he perked up and is moving around MUCH better.....this has been a lot more effective than powdered glucosamine....made a real difference!

review/summary: I noticed improvement!
review/text: I'm very happy with this product -- I give it to all of my dogs, but especially my Golden, who has arthritis.  It's easy to dispense and a great price. She gets it twice a day and after about two weeks of use, I noticed that she gets up easier and seems to be able to walk easier. I've also switched to organic dog food (Wellness) and have added Fish Oil to my dogs food.  All that combined seems to have made a difference in all my animals.  Yes, its more $$, but worth it to keep the fur kids happy and healthy.<br /><br />Update:  My Golden is doing wonderfully.  She even comes to the door to get me when I come home now, with a toy in her mouth.  She never did much but lay around before.  She's also on lo-cal kibble...she was 130 pounds and is now 117 pounds. I would never stop giving this to her -- much better than steroids.<br /><br />2/25/12  Still using this and it's the best I've tried.  I did try BellyRubs brand.  Found it to be too thick.  I'm sticking with this one...my dogs liked both, but K-9 is easier to use.  Not as messy.

review/text: My dog can get nit picky with what he eats and this passed the test! He sniffed at it the first time but since then can't wait to get it poured on his food. He's a 10 year old lab mix and this seems to perk him up and get him moving better. It's really hard to say for certain how they feel exactly but his activity levels are up since beginning using it a month ago.

review/summary: Love This Stuff
review/text: We have two pugs, a nine year old and a four year old.  Both have arthritis on their back legs.  Our vet recommended glucosamine with MSM.  I tried the chewable tablets and that was a bust.  Both dogs hated them.  Then I did an Amazon search and discovered this liquid formula.  The dogs LOVE it.  Along with the ease of use, neither dog has had any trouble with their legs since I started using this product.  If you have an arthritic pet, you should give Liquid Health K-9 a try.  I don't think you will be disappointed.

review/text: I have been using this product for approximately 6 months and there is a definite change in my dogs.  Both of my dogs are older (9 and 11) so I wanted something to keep them feeling good and active.  My youngest has arthitis and this has helped to move around easier and he has more energy! I think this is one of the best hip and joint formulas I have tried. I would definitely recommend it.

review/text: The product has a build in chamber that you can fill up simply by squeezing the bottle. There are also markings on the side to let you know how much so you can pour out exactly what is needed. BUT the problem is the container is not see through, nor can you see it while putting it up against the light. I even tried using a marker to mark the outside....still no luck. I'm basically stuck using a measuring utensil of my own. Smart idea....stupid execution. :(

review/summary: Good product
review/text: My dog loves the taste of the liquid health formula, which is the most important thing right up front.  I've gotten supplements for her before which she refused to eat.  Not only that, but after being on this product for a couple of weeks, my dog has better mobility in her hind legs.  My only complaint is that you can't see through the automatic portion filling side.  You have to put it under a light and look down into it.  That's why I only gave it four stars.  Once opened it has to be refrigerated, but my dog doesn't mind that it is cold on her food.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: This stuff is amazing. My sweet almost 13 year old Chow Lab mix (60lbs) has really bad hips/arthritis. She was using it for about a year and the difference between using it and not using it was/is huge. Within the first week I could see i major improvement in the way she could stand up, I started ordering this by the gallon so we would never run out. The vet even mentioned a difference when she came in to get her arthritis RX Meds. She was running outside, chasing the neighbors cats, jumping back up on the couch to sleep etc, Just overall great improvements. Something changed in her appetite and she wont eat her food when i put this on so i have moved on to million dollar glucosamine treats but they aren't as awesome as k-9 heath.  I hope my dog changes her mind and will move back to the liquid health and even if she doesn't i would still always always recommend this.

review/summary: Excellent price for a high-quality product that even picky dogs enjoy
review/text: I have two dogs:  an 11.5 pound shih-tzu terrier (aka the pickiest eater ever) and a 61 pound pit bull mix (aka garbage can).  A few months ago, I took them on a long hike and noticed that my pit bull was limping a little.  I immediately freaked out and spent the next few hours researching glucosamine for dogs.  My requirements were that the product was made in the USA, was in liquid form so there's a shot that picky eater would actually ingest it, and that the it contained glucosamine HCL vs. sulfate as the former is supposed to be absorb more quickly and provider greater benefit.  I also didn't want to pay an astronomical price.  This liquid lasts me about a month given to my dogs twice per day.  I find the packaging a bit odd as I see why they want to make it "easier" to pour out liquid, but frankly, it makes a giant crusty mess.  Instead, I use a sterilized soap dispenser, dump this in, and add two pumps to my big girl's food and one pump to my little guy...who, by the way, actually eats it with no problem (hallelujah).

About the second day of using Liquid Health, my miniature pinscher  was able-bodied and had no hiccups in standing or running around. His back legs used to shake on walks, but now they rarely shake and only for a second or two.<br /><br />Very glad I bought this, and will buy it again when this batch is used up.

review/summary: This makes a visible difference in my dogs motion!!!!
review/text: My dog is a rescue dog she was beaten almost to death before a kind person found her and took her to the shelter. A by product of that abuse was an injury in her knee that is the equivalent of a torn ACL in a human. Surgery saved her leg, but she favors it and is stiff due to arthritis in the knee joint. K9 glucosamine suggests 2tsp 2times a day for her weight, I started her on 3 tsp 2 times a day, wow! She does not limp or act like she is in pain at all! This result happened within 2 days of starting. I tried to cut down to the suggested dosage, then she limped a little. switched back to 3tsp 2 times a day and she is back to running around with no noticeable limp at all! This product is now a staple in our house, it is fantastic.

review/summary: Good Product Easy to Use
review/text: We own 3 Cairn terriers. The older dogs are ages 13 and 14 and both are now taking Liquid Health K-9 but the 8 year old is not. I'm a minimalist when it comes to dietary supplements. If a dog has a balanced diet, exercise, fresh water and plenty of love supplements should not be necessary. However, I believe older dogs do benefit from Glucosamine. I like Liquid Health K-9 because, it's economical, generally easy to use (I use a measuring spoon) and the liquid form of Glucosamine is easily digestible. Most importantly it seems to work. Both dogs move more fluidly and various signs of arthritic pain are gone since they went on Glucosamine. The only slight inconvenience is that the product needs to be refrigerated once open and shaken before use.  In our case it's not much of an inconvenience but for some the need to refrigerate may be a problem. Prior to using this product we used a tablet form of Glucosamine. Tablets are easier for travel.  As always, Amazon price was great and delivery fast. Love Amazon!!!

review/text: Don't know how to rate this. Product was not designed for kitty cats. The dose is definitely for a dog, a bigger dog. I prefer something stronger so the dose can be smaller. I ordered Syn-Flex for my kitty. Smaller dose for a smaller beast. Don't know if this was effective because I could not use it more than once without a major revolt from kitty. She also did not like the taste. Guess the title "K-9" was a clue.

review/text: While the packaging leaves a little to be desired (they attempted to make measuring an easy process but failed) this works great and my dog doesn't have any issues with the taste.  She gets salmon oil and this on top of her dog food.  She went from limping and being stiff on getting up, to running around playing more, getting on the furniture again, wasn't able to get on the bed and now she can.  She's doing great! You can't tell she ever had any problems!  I would like to see this have a pump style dispenser like the salmon oil has.  I keep both in the fridge door and the salmon oil I can just hold up the food dish and squirt the correct number of pumps for her size.

He has had problems with his front and back legs where he would stop playing b/c of the soreness, he would also need some help in and out of the car. Now he'll play and play, he even can jump into the back of our wagon on his own (which is pretty good since he's only about a 1' 1/2 tall). It is also very easy to distribute, we've had no problems putting it in his food. If your companion has arthritis pain, I would definitely give this a try, of course consult with your vet first.

review/text: I have two dogs, both about 65 lbs. each.  I just moved into an upstairs apartment & thought they could use a little joint support now that they're seniors... one is 8, the other 9.  Within a few days of adding this supplement to their food, they were bounding up and down the stairs like little freight trains.  My 8 year old (who had been showing signs of joint stiffness.. getting up slowly, hesitant to jump down off the bed, etc.) is like a puppy again!!  I was in awe of how quickly it worked... and sure enough, when I began to run out and stopped giving it to them, they began to move more slowly & Parker (the 8 year old with signs of arthritis) was back to moving like a senior dog.  I started giving it to them again just a couple days ago & they're already starting to show signs of improvement again.  VERY impressed with the results!!  Will definitely be buying more and keeping plenty in stock!!! :)

I received a trial size of this product from the hippie dog store in town. Hoo boy - she's been licking her plate clean. Too soon to tell how it might benefit her ancient joints, but I'm definitely going to order more if for no other reason than to get her to eat!

Me being a freaked out doggy parent started researching online and came across this product. I decided to give it a try and see if it would help.<br /><br />Talking about what an amazing product! My dog is back to normal activities and is zipping through the house :) I just mix the formula in his food and he is good to go. This is fabulous because he usually thinks I'm trying to poison him when I give him medicine and it becomes a terrible struggle. He takes this with no problems, my dog is a shih tzu mix by the way if that helps.<br /><br />Definitely worth a try if your baby is struggling.

review/summary: Amazing product!
review/text: My elderly, mixed-breed dog used to limp more often than not after running in the yard. Different legs seemed to hurt her at different times. There were a few times where she held up one leg for almost a week and limped around on 3 legs. Since we bought this product, she no longer limps...ever! She runs and jumps like a much younger dog. I can not say enough about how much we love this product. It has dramatically improved our dog's quality of life! She is happy and pain free because of this product.

review/summary: Give your dog a chance to live a better life.
review/text: My 11 year old lab has been having hip problems for awhile now and I have heard alot of good reviews on liquid glucosamine and was excited to try it. Unfortunetly finding where to get it was the problem I called vet after vet and store after store with no luck. Then I hit up the net and decided on amazon. It was somewhat reasonably priced and the shipping and handling was free. I have seen progress with the product and the dispension is very simple once you figure it out. I plan on sticking with it for as long as it works. Pryer to this I had been giving my dog human glucosamine pills but was very unsatisfied with those results or should I say lack of. You do have to be realistic though and realize that you can't expect miracles progress is progress though.

review/summary: K-9 Liquid Glucosamine
review/text: We have two smaller 'rescure' dogs.  One has problems with his hind leg 'knees'.  We were told that he might end up with arthritis.  He's having cold laser treatments, etc.  Our Vet mentioned that treating him with Glucosamine might help to ease any arthritic problems in the future.  We have both dogs on this every morning mixed into their wet food and THEY LOVE IT!  One morning we forgot to use it and neither dog was all that interested in their food.  We added it and they turned, once again, into chow hounds.  THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think we'll be ordering this on a regular basis.

review/text: Bought this for my little 15 year old Pekingnese with leg problems.  After just 3 weeks he is again able to go for longer walks and has even gone up and done to the second floor.  I use glucosamine MSM myself and thought when Fred was having problems why not try something for dogs.<br /><br />This is just the best.  If your pets are having leg issues  I would give this a try.  So much better than pills to try to get them to take.  I simply add to his food 2 x a day.  Must be flavorless...Fred is a bit picky and never even balk at this.  Good luck...give it a try...great stuff!

review/summary: My dog feels 2 years younger with this!
review/text: We call this product the Elixir of Life for our dog.  We have a golden retriever, and he started showing signs of hip problems when he was about 6 or 7.  Although he doesn't have dysplasia as is common with the breed, arthritis is also very common among the retriever breeds.  We walk a mile or more with him every day and are very good about keeping him at the proper weight, but these basic steps weren't enough to prevent or control the arthritis in his hips.  He has been using this product regularly since he was roughly 8 ( he's a rescue dog and former stray so we're really just guessing on his age).  At that point, he started really having a hard time on the stairs, and would sometimes yelp when getting up in the morning.  After his first bottle of k-9 Liquid Health, he was going up the stairs just fine, like he did when he was younger.  No more morning pain, either.  Two years later, it is catching up with him, and I am seeing some hip discomfort, but it is still better than he was 2 years ago without this medication.  I just can't say enough good things about a supplement that makes my dog comfortable and able to enjoy himself again.  BTW, the Amazon price is about 50% less than our local pet store.

review/summary: Wonder Drug!
review/text: I began giving this to my 10 year old lab two weeks ago after noticing the sudden onset of weakness in his back legs. Along with this came a drop in his energy which I attributed to old age setting in.<br />After two weeks of giving him this stuff twice daily I've noticed:<br /><br />1. Considerable strengthening of his back legs<br />2. Significantlly increased energy<br />3. His coat is better than it's been in years<br /><br />And there's been an unexpected benefit: his persistent eye infection has completely gone away. No more runny nose. No more eye discharge. No more droppy eyes. All had been treated by my vet with antibotics on two separate occasions only to have the symptoms return withing weeks.<br /><br />I don't know which ingredient is responsible for the improvement but it's well worth the $20 I paid for this. This is a terrific product!

review/text: Let me start by saying I am a lover of Rottweilers. My 6 year old female Rott (Obi) weighs about 83 lbs, she started walking with a limp about a year ago, the limp slowly progressed to not running or jumping and severe difficulties sitting and rising again. I went through all my options, including surgery,  until my husband found out about this product. Obi has been taking K9 Glucosamine for a little over 2 months and is doing surprisingly better. She is not limping anymore and she is running and getting up and down with no problem. I am very pleased with the results Obi has experienced! She is the active dog I am used to seeing. P.S. If the dog starts vomiting, give her a little medicine at a time so they can get used to it.

He was sore to the point that he couldn't even get up off the floor and he was like this for about 4 or 5 months straight.  The vet prescribed anti-inflammatories however never really knew what was wrong with him after x-rays and numerous blood tests.  I thought I would try this product after reading the many positive reviews on it.  Angus is a new dog!  After being on this product for about a month, we noticed significant change in him.  He is running around like a puppy and just loving life again.  I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone!  I'm so happy to see him happy again!

review/summary: Old Dog Does Better
review/text: My old dog is close to ten years old and like many big dogs, he suffers from back-end arthritis.  I give him the glucosamine each evening in his food.  His teeth are somewhat worn down, so water plus the Liquid Health softens his dry dog food so it can be eaten quickly.  He did not turn up his nose from the very first time, so it has no medicine taste apparently.<br />He gets up from a resting position, not as fast as he might have years ago, but he does not whimper or show signs of pain.  It is a good product and works for my Beau.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00178TEW4">K-9 Glucosamine MSM - Improve the condition of animals suffering from joint ailments,32 oz,(Health Herbs)</a>

I use it in conjuction with DGP daily and the results have been absolutely astounding.  This has redefined the life of one of my precious rescue dogs; she is 10 and had previous injuries and she was miserable and cranky all the time, until I started her on this regiment.  Now she runs around me and plays like a youngster, and she knows that I'm doing something to help her because she practically tells me so!  I also give it to my 5 year old that had a broken leg sometime prior to my adopting him, and now has joint limitations, and he is much more at ease with this!!

I bought them as a preview for a gift and was hugely disappointed to see how they were shipped - they were in a bag and were put into a larger box so that when the post office handled the box, the product got knocked around and at least one third of the product was broken apart. I phoned Amazon immediately to report this and they gave me credit for the purchase. That's a nice gesture but my hope is they will tell the seller to protect the product by shrink wrapping it tightly so the almonds don't break apart. A purchaser needs confidence when ordering a gift - confidence that the product has a good chance of arriving intact. Flavor of the almonds are great.

review/text: I have been drinking Barry's gold blend for years. Make it in a small teapot(1 to 2 person teapot -- Japanese teapots are the best and with a removable strainer to easily throw out the leaves).  Wouldn't think of using tea bags (made of tea leaf dust NOT real tea leaves). My oldest son who is working in Singapore now asked me to send a couple of packs because it's hard to start the day without it.  Barry's is never bitter -- but it is strong and has depth.  Love it, can't start the day without it. I always drink with non-fat milk.

review/summary: Dogs love them, but they are MADE IN CHINA!
review/text: My dogs love these. But when I looked on the package to see where they came from, I had to pull off a sticker on the back, and in very small print it say made in china.  Very disapointing, to say the least, especially when they were clearly trying to hide that fact.

review/summary: Free Range Dog Chews
review/text: Free Range Chicken Wrapped Beef Liver is a big HIT in this family!  I have a very finiky Cocker, who also has all the food allergies a dog can get, but these are natural and won't hurt her. But the best is yet to come- SHE LOVE'S THEM! That's all I need to keep getting them for her.  So go ahead, take a chance, these are a winner!

review/summary: All-time Favorite
review/text: I have 2 Yorkies and a Maltese. These chicken breast wraps (with liver especially) are their favorite. Since these are over an inch long, I slice each piece into about 5 bite-size pieces so I get a lot more from one bag. My kids will sit, lay down, crawl and do whatever it takes to have this treat. If you want full attention from them, just wave the bag!

review/summary: My Dogs Love It
review/text: All three of my dogs love these chicken breasts wrapped with liver, but the little one, a chihuahua mix, who turns his nose at all foods and treats will actually eat these treats. The fact that they have no additives and are from free range animals makes me feel better about this being his only meal some days.
