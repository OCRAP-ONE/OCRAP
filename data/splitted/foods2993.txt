review/summary: Great product
review/text: This pet food mat is a heavier, thicker material than I expected, which is good!  It doesn't slip around and the edges are high enough to catch stray food/water.  Bowls do slip around on top of it, so if you want the top to be non-slip, pick something else or get bowls with a rubber bottom.  Otherwise, I love it!  I've only had it a few days, but I imagine it will be simple to clean as well when the time comes.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Cat Food Mat
review/text: The mat works very well in keeping the cat's food and water contained. The lip is a good height and the mat doesn't slide.  No more messy floors because my cat thinks her water dish is a swimming pool.  The only fault, as another customer has mentioned, is that the mat I received is bright blue instead of the beige color that is shown.

review/summary: safety concern
review/text: This container was delivered about an hour ago in a cardboard box with other food items. So far no problem, but after taking this 24 oz container out of the box I noticed it had no tight plastic wrapping around it that could protect it from tampering.<br />After opening the cover i noticed there was a round paper right under the cover that is supposed to be glued completely around the top of the container. This paper was only glued half way around the container.... in other words, there is the possibility of tampering with this product. I cannot trust it, so even though the parmesan cheese smells good i would rather not take chances on that one.

review/text: My green cup arrived (They sent 2) and when I opened the box, I thought... what a joke.  It was two pieces, a green cup with a cover that snapped on top.  It came with a pod so I popped the pod into the cup, put on the cover and inserted in my Keurig. To my surprise the coffee was great. It has no moving parts and seems so simple but really works.  My only complaint is the pod they provided (Brioni's) I can't find on Amazon or anywhere else.

review/text: Well, I was at the neighborhood grocery store with my little boy (3) and we were going past the candy isle. Any of you with kids knows what that means. The question is not whether you'll get some candy, but what kind of candy are you going to get? Well, I don't like to feed the guy sugar, so I found these Ice Breakers Frost (wintercool) mints which are sugar free. He could hardly wait until we got out of the store to have one and I had one with him. Mmmmmm. These things are really good. Brisk and refreshing. Nice tasting. Long lasting. He loves them. Now he's carrying his little box around as a prize and I give him another every once in a while. I might have another myself too.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Got these to put in my automatic dispenser (instead of candy) at work. These satisfy sudden, pre-break hunger nicely, and I like that they're a significant source of protein which stabilizes blood sugar. The color mix is  visually enticing and decorative in the clear dispenser, and they taste great. In fact, they've been declared "wonderful" by everyone in my office. The Wasabi taste is addictive, and these are just lightly dusted/coated. Perfect.<br /><br />Also, the seller (American Spice Co) got them here incredibly quickly, long before the projected date.  I'm greatly impressed. The only way they could have gotten here quicker is to ship them BEFORE I ordered.  This is an item that I will order again and again.

review/summary: So far this is the ONLY product that satisfies my craving for bread
review/text: FIRST -- Let me tell you that I am the type of person who -- while not fat, does need to be aware of weight issues and watch calories.  A woman reaches an age where even a former skinnywinny has to do that.  And I am a former skinnywinny who used to eat the entire bread basket and ask for more at a restaurant before the meal even arrived. I love bread. . . all kinds of bread.  And I hate having to limit how much I eat of it these days. So, three cheers (or 30) to Wegman's food for producing the only product I've ever found to satisfy my craving for bread -- and for ONLY 16 calories per slice . . .er, per "popcake."  I've tried Ak-Mok, flat bread, pita bread, Ry-Krisp, home-baked, wheat thins, salt-rising, oat bread, seven-grain, organic, beer bread, sour dough, high-fiber/low fat bread, Trader Joe's mini-muffins, the 45-calorie slices one of the bakeries puts out, hi-fiber low-cal white tortillas (which aren't horrible) . . . but this stuff ACTUALLY DOES quench my bread cravings with minimum calories and maximum satisfaction.  Forget those puffed rice cakes! Yeeccchhh! Like eating styrofoam.  Plus, they crumble all over the place.  But these are heaven.  I cannot get enough. Or, rather, I CAN get enough to satisfy me so that I do not have to stuff my face on actual bread. Maybe it's the shape. They're about the size of a tortilla, only puffy. Texture is similar to the rice cakes, except for the "mouthfeel," (I understand this is a technical term that professional food tasters use, ha ha!). These feel a little "slick" in your mouth, which is so much better than rice cakes and, somehow, they are not as dry. They're a little "glossy" on the tongue, not "matte" and flat.<br /><br />You can cut them in half and put sandwich spread on them, such as tuna fish, or diet mayo, cucumber, and thin slices of lunch meat or roast beef, or ham and mustard.  Then cover them with the other half and you have a sandwich! With only 16 calories of bread!  Or, you can even eat peanut butter and jelly.  IT's easy to spread them with tub/bin-style margarines or butter substitutes... Or, even whipped butter if you want to pig out.  Or, eat them with a thin trail of honey drizzled over them.<br />However you use bread, you can use these (except for French toast -- I'm sure that would NOT work.)  I have not put them into the toaster yet, but I might try it on low at some point. (They might shrivel or burn fast . . .I don't know.  But my instincts tell me they'd be okay on the "low" setting, and just get brown and even tastier. I love to put soft boiled eggs on them with salt substitute and pepper, though I boil the eggs until the yolk has thickened a little and isn't really too runny anymore because if you put really wet things on these, the liquid WILL bleed through and drop on your blouse or something.  I would NOT put pickle relish on them (too wet), or tomatoes (unless I covered the "popcake" with a layer of mayo, butter, or a big, wide lettuce leaf).  I did eat them with a pretty runny egg once and the egg dripped out through a soaked crack in the popcake.<br /><br />I think the thing I love most about them is that, while they are mostly AIR, they actually TASTE like yeasty bread.  And they are really crisp.<br />I can eat a whole one during the afternoon -- either along with shaved carrots and Laughing Cow lite cheese, or with a piece of low-fat, or no-fat cheese and cucumber and mustard or lite mayo.  It's flavor, plus texture...  I suppose if I sprayed them with butter spray, and sprinkled them with that yellow "popcorn salt" that you can buy in some grocery stores, I could sneak about 7 of them into the theater in my purse and be very happy guzzling them down and pigging out on them for about 112 calories.  That would get me through a movie... ha, ha.  I could have my "popcake" and eat it too!  Normally I do not go on and rave about products.  And I realize it's a matter of personal taste.  Some people might find them a bit styrofoamy due to their airy texture.  But I am so grateful to have found a substitute for bread that actually has that "bready" taste, something that I can use for sandwiches (which I love) and still feel satisfied, that I am celebrating the crispy texture rather than complaining about missing that yielding, semi-moist texture and fragrance of fresh-baked bread. I feel like I've just gone to Marshall's and bought a Ralph Lauren Black Label Evening Gown that fits great and looks like dynamite for only $10.99.  If you have to buy $30 worth of these, or 10 of them, to qualify to purchase them online, I believe you will not regret getting so many UNLESS THEY GET STALE DURING SHIPPING.  I would not know about that.  I got mine at Whole Foods in Massachusetts.  Not sure if they're available on the West Coast -- I've not ever seen them there.  And never at a standard grocery store like Ralph's, Von's, Safeway, Market Basket, Albertson's, or other chains.  Just Whole Foods, though some of the other artisan-style foodstores might -- just might -- carry them.  You might check the actual Coco foods site by doing a search engine search.  Anyway, I think this is one of the best diet aids EVER! Hope this helps.  And no, I do not work for the company or have any relatives working for them.  I usually am a bit critical of products.

review/summary: My kids (and I) LOVE these!
review/text: I LOVE this product.  My 12 month old and 3 year old can't get enough of them.  I used to buy the Baby Mum-Mums, because it was a choke-free snack that kept babies and toddlers busy and happy, but I always had serious qualms about the fact that they were made in china.  After passing these by in the store forever, I finally picked up the Coco pop cakes at Whole Foods one day and realized it was PERFECT.  It totally melts in baby's mouth, just like the mum-mums, so a great non-chokable snack for anywhere.  My baby loves crunching on it, it makes him so happy and keeps him occupied.  And since they are light and airy, I don't worry that I'm filling my kids up on too many crackers.  Its also very neat.  Don't know why these aren't marketed more towards kids/babies, they'd make a gold mine if they did.<br /><br />Note - I haven't actually purchased these from Amazon yet, only at Whole Foods.  But we go through them so fast at our house (not only do the kids love it, but the adults do too for all types of light snacks), but I plan to buy them from here so that I can get them in bulk.

review/summary: all right by me !!!
review/text: Trident White makes a terrific "cool rush" flavored sugarless gum. The sugar free gum is healthier for your teeth; and the gum makes your breath fresh in an instant. The thin cardboard package is easy to carry because it is so small; and inside the thin cardboard package the pieces of gum are wrapped individually in tiny plastic pockets that are easy to open. The package states that the gum whitens teeth but I cannot comment on that. Always remember to brush your teeth--this gum isn't a substitute for that!<br /><br />A single piece of gum has absolutely no sugar; it has only a measly five calories--hooray! Trident White uses sorbitol and aspartame to sweeten the gum. There is no fat in this gum either.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some people won't be able to chew this gum because of certain ingredients that may disagree with them. This gum contains a milk derived ingredient; and it also contains phenylalanine. In addition, use this gum before any expiration date printed on the back of the thin cardboard container. Don't chew stale gum!<br /><br />Have further questions? No problem--the manufacturers give you both a toll free number and a website. The website goes into detail about how this gum helps to whiten your teeth.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great gum that comes packaged in an easy to carry container. This gum makes your breath fresh; and it's a very tasty gum that you won't want to spit out after a mere five minutes. The twelve-pack is economical, too.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Variable quality, but when you get a well-done pack, it's great!
review/text: I've been buying these for hubby's lunch and our snacks since last year. I'm a cheese addict, and though I can't have as much as I did in my fatter days (yeah, I gotta watch the calories), I still love cheese for a snack.<br /><br />These have a nice crispness/crunch. Very flavorful with the "everything" spicing. (If you like Everything Bagels, this is like that, no bread, for us gluten free folks).<br /><br />My problem with these is consistency. Sometimes, I get a batch that's really overdone, burnt. And the taste of the toppings "burnt" is not good. Those batches I have to toss in the trash. BUT...when it's good, it's REALLY good.<br /><br />I hope they have their caloric stuff sorted out. I found that the info on servings did not match-up with what was in the container (ie, it said 6 servings per pack, with 3 crisps per serving). Well, when there are 11 or 12 (varies) crisps in a container, that's nowhere near 18, which would be 6 servings. So, I don't know if the caloric info is correct, but the servings on the packages I have are off.<br /><br />I do enjoy these, and I recommend them for folks who can tolerate cheese as a snack. A fun crisp and flavorful snack, if sometimes inconsistent in quality control and wacky in package info. :D<br /><br />I do prefer the plain ones, though. I haven't had a bad batch of those yet, and I've bought at least 2 dozen packs so far. (I haven't used amazon yet, but have used Netrition, with no problem.)<br /><br />Enjoy...

review/summary: My dogs love this!
review/text: What can a person say about a dog treat. They are all the same, right? Wrong. I have tried so many treats on the market that I can't remember half of them any longer. I like the Old Mother Hubbard Meaties treats for dogs...chicken flavor. First of all the size is perfect to use in training your dog. So many of the training treats out there are just too small or too large. These treats are the perfect size. I usually get the chicken flavor but with the extra chicken added. It comes in Lamb and Liver flavor too. When I yell to my dogs that I have a 'special treat for you' they come running, which is what I want. They even know where I keep it and poke it with their noses while they wait impatiently for me to open the bag. I make them sit before I give it to them. They love the flavor of the extra chicken treats and never turn it down. I like it because of the size and my use in training with the dogs. I usually buy them 10 bags at a time because I go through them so fast. It's one of my favorite things to reach for with the dogs. The price has continued to go up on this product but so has it for other dog treats as well. I also like the fact that Old Mother Hubbard uses only a good quality of things in their products.

review/text: I can't say how good it is because I never tried them myself, but both of my dogs love it! It's one of the few ways I can get them to come on back home when they are out in the back yard. I just yell that I have their chicken treats and they come running. I go through them very quickly as I use them for treats all the time. They are just great for training, small, yet bite sized where they feel like they are eating something. The taste must be good to get my two dogs to do things they don't like to do. I buy them all the time. Old Mother Hubbard makes quality dog food and treats and I recommend this to all my friends that own dogs.

And for dipping, nothing beats Fritos Scoopers (not available here, alas) into a bowl of Lay's Creamy Ranch Dip (also, alas, not available here).<br /><br />So bring on the playoffs; usher in the buzzer beaters; welcome the wild card.

review/summary: java podz
review/text: We own the Senseo coffee maker and were using the Senseo coffee pods.  I was so excited to find the Javapodz flavored coffee.  However, they tell you that you only need to use one pod for an 8oz cup, unlike the Senseo coffee where you use 2 pods for an 8 oz cup.  After drinking the Senseo, I found the Javapods to be a bit weaker coffee flavor, especially after I add half and half.<br /><br />My remedy to this was to use one Senseo mild pod and one flavored javapod and make a 12 oz cup, by using the 2 cup button and then directly after without changing pods I used the 1 cup button.  This works wonderfully for me as I get the stronger coffee taste with the wonderful flavor that Javapodz offers.  It makes a super iced coffee as well!<br /><br />The packaging is great.  Each pod is foil wrapped so they stay fresh for a long time.

review/summary: not quite enough coffee per pod for advertised 8oz brew
review/text: the main issue with these pods would be that there's not quite enough coffe in one pod for the advertised 8oz brew of coffee.  they expect you to make an 8 oz brew with their single pod as opposed to 2 Senseo pods, which end up having significantly more coffee to brew from than their only slight larger single pod.  the result is very watery coffee--well, almost tasteless.  to remedy this, instead of placing their single pod into the 1pod holder, place 2 pods into the 2pod holder for an 8oz brew which makes a more tolerabe coffee in terms of strength.<br /><br />the next problem is taste.  this is all preference but i find the taste decent at best.  it's lacking in flavor and body.  perhaps a bit bitter too.<br /><br />lastly, the packaging is embarrasing (if not hugely questionable).  the inidividual pods came in very scratched, generic packaging.  meanwhile all 15 pods were packaged together in not some proper javapodz logo-ed box but...a ZIPLOC bag!  (which actually would be forgiveable if the inidividual pod wrappings didn't look so worn, cheap, and almost fake.)  I was hoping to try their other flavors but now I'm highly reluctant to.<br /><br />The pods by Gourmet Cafe, another coffee pod stocked at amazon, I tried previously were quite good.  Those are good to try if you're disappointed with these Javapodz.

All other brands have some form of corn that causes fatigue and concentration problems.  My first order was a week ago, me and my sons are finished with 8 cartoons already.  We race to the refrigerator like its a dessert.<br />  I have fibromyalgia, there are so many foods and drinks I can not eat or drink.  This multi-grain rice milk is my work-out nutrition drink. I can't drink any other health drinks, sports drinks, protein drinks, pops or cool-aids. My plans are to use multi-grain rice milk to make ice-cream and use in cooking recipes because I can't eat any ice-cream or sherbet products either. Please give others a chance to try.  This product is a winner!

review/text: I first tried this brand at Whole Foods who is no longer carrying it anymore and I'm not quite sure why. I requested them to put it back on the shelves even though it makes more sense to buy in bulk. Still need to run out on an emergency basis every once in a while :)<br /><br />Anyway this ricemilk is by far hands down the best ever! I've tried numberous brands and this stuff rocks. There is no chalky taste to it and doesn't leave any funky after taste either. The chocolate ricemilk is to die for. Yum....and whole grains! Only downfall is once you've opened it, it's best to use with in a week otherwise it gets pretty thick and nasty.

review/text: Can't we just say 48 frog legs instead of "24 pair"?  Do the left and right legs taste differently?  I was a connoisseur of frog legs for several years until one fateful day at an authentic Chinese restaurant.  I was delighted to see a placard for frogs' legs on the buffet sneeze shield until I discovered that the legs were prepared attached at the crotch.  Being a fan of the dish, I placed several on my plate and returned to my table.  I immediately used my knife to separate the legs and attempted to enjoy my entree.  The legs were prepared exquisitely; however, I could not enjoy them as I kept imagining going down on an amphibian.  Since that day in 1999, I have forsaken all exotic foods of the oriental variety.  This includes:<br /><br />1. frogs-legs attached at the crotch<br />2. fish served with head and eyeballs displayed<br />3. whole baby octopi<br />4. anything with tentacles<br />5. shrimp with heads<br />6. deviled eggs<br />7. jello

review/summary: Rawhide Chicken Bones...
review/text: I certainly respect another reviewer's opinion about the bones falling apart into "a million pieces."  However, I have ordered these bones about eight times and all-in-all, I am happy.  I gave it a four-star rating because I typically am very conservative when rating items.  My dog is a large Yellow Lab, about 100 pounds.  Ideally, these bones are a little too small for him, but they are a good deal.  I wish that they were a little bit bigger.  However, if you have a dog of approximately 35-70 pounds, then they might be fine.  My dog does eat them quickly (within ten minutes), but he seems to enjoy them.  There seems to be about 20 per bag, but I will have to check this more closely when I receive my next shipment.<br /><br />I am very aware of what I eat and what my dog eats.  So I was very careful when giving him the first bone.  I gave him one and waited a few days before giving him a second, just to see how he reacted.  Everything was fine, and continues to be fine.<br /><br />One thing that I don't like, but will probably not bother most people, is that they are packed in a very thick type of plastic bag; very durable, but it scares the heck out of me because I don't like plastic touching food, due to potential chemicals that can be released, especially during shipping when they might be subjected to very warm temperatures in planes or trucks.  So I take all of the bones out as soon as I receive them and put them in a big cardboard box that I am able to seal up.<br /><br />In summary, I am happy with these bones because my dog never reacted negatively or got sick and they seem to be of acceptable quality.  One final note, if you order the beef-flavored bones, which are dark brown in color, please note that when my dog starts getting them wet from his mouth, that they heavily stained my light tan carpet.  So I stick with these chicken-flavored, or the peanut-butter flavored.

review/text: I am a intermediate school teacher.  Our class dissected grass frogs.  Afterwards, I 'treated' them to fried frog legs!  The order was delivered on time, packaged well, and the kids...after some hesitation...LOVED THEM!!!!

review/text: Greetings:<br /><br />I blew off your first request for a review....however, will respond to your second request & trust that you will never print it....am not interested in casting any bad light on the vendor nor do I want any retaliation from same....with that said, suffice it to merely say that I was most disappointed in what I received for what I paid....the actual weight of the frog legs was @ 3 1/2 #s & they were small (I went to Wal-Mart & bought a diet scale to weigh them)....my total cost was @ $65.00 & divided by the #'s was costing me @ $18.57 a pound....imagine my surprise when I discovered the next week that I could buy JUMBO frog legs for @ $3.99 a pound locally....in fact, just purchased 10 #s yesterday for @ $40.00....want to see the receipt?  I'll send it to you....<br /><br />Bottom line, it has opened my eyes to NOT think that ordering anything online is going to be cheaper than buying locally....from here on, will always exhaust all local vendors for anything I want before resorting to online....that's a reversal from the way I used to shop....suffice it to say, I will NEVER order frog legs from you folks again, & short of the great deal you offer on Colman's Mustard, will check locally on everything from here on....thanks for the lesson learned!  Have a Nice day....tfg

review/summary: redundancy
review/text: Can't we just say 48 frog legs instead of "24 pair"?  Do the left and right legs taste differently?  I was a connoisseur of frog legs for several years until one fateful day at an authentic Chinese restaurant.  I was delighted to see a placard for frogs' legs on the buffet sneeze shield until I discovered that the legs were prepared attached at the crotch.  Being a fan of the dish, I placed several on my plate and returned to my table.  I immediately used my knife to separate the legs and attempted to enjoy my entree.  The legs were prepared exquisitely; however, I could not enjoy them as I kept imagining going down on an amphibian.  Since that day in 1999, I have forsaken all exotic foods of the oriental variety.  This includes:<br /><br />1. frogs-legs attached at the crotch<br />2. fish served with head and eyeballs displayed<br />3. whole baby octopi<br />4. anything with tentacles<br />5. shrimp with heads<br />6. deviled eggs<br />7. jello

review/summary: Great Bone!
review/text: I got my Jack Russell puppy started on Glucosamine bones several months ago and she loves them!  I was buying them at the local pet store for the same price and they only had one knot while these have two and last longer for the same price!  Best of all, I don't have to leave the house to go to the pet store!  My puppy is now 8-months old and one of these bones will last her about 1.5 to 2 weeks and she chews on it constantly.  I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: not a bone for aggressive chewers
review/text: I have a pitbull boxer mix who will chew on anything and everything. It's been a struggle to find anything that lasts more than  a day or two. This bone was no exception--Charlie had it finished in a day. Also, it was smaller than I expected. I would not recommend this bone for a dog that likes to chew. I gave it three stars, however, but he seemed to enjoy the taste of it. Otherwise, I'd like my money back. =(

review/text: I have a MAJOR chewer. So far, this bone is lasting longer than bones of the same size I've purchased before. Also, she hasn't choked at all, which is amazing, because she always finds some way to try and shove a giant piece of rawhide down her throat. **panic time** I was suspicious of the "safety" knot claim, but so far, so good. She has only managed to get little, safe-sized pieces. I will be purchasing again.

I had to take each one away after a few hours, wait several days and give it back to her to finish up in a few more hours.  It also gave her gas.  I do have an aggressive chewer which is why I tried these rather expensive rawhides.  I will not purchase again.

review/text: I recently discovered this cereal and wow, do I love it! It tastes great; it fills me up; and this will be the cereal I now eat most frequently!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* It is organic and there are no genetically engineered ingredients.<br /><br />* I like knowing that it is relatively healthy for me. It has a lot of whole grain in each serving.<br /><br />* As of this time the price here is less than what I pay at my neighborhood supermarket.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* It also contains a fair amount of sugar--in fact, it has more sugar than a well-known brand of sugar coated corn flake cereal! That's a disappointment.<br /><br />* It is a bit expensive if you consider that you only get 17 ounces in each box.<br /><br />Overall, despite a drawback or two this remains an excellent, comparatively healthy and delicious cereal. I recommend it.

I certainly liked the raisins, but remember thinking, if this stuff was good for me, why did I feel so heavy after eating it? That's why I like this variety. Beyond the health and environmental benefits of organic raising, this stuff tastes good and leaves me energized after eating. A breakfast of this stuff with orange juice, and I feel ready to take on the world.

review/summary: Great taste, but lots of sugar
review/text: One of the best cereals I've had. Great taste and not overly sweet (until you get a cluster of 5 raisins). However there's 16g of sugar per serving (mostly from the raisins I'm guessing), which is quite high. Even something like Fruity pebbles which is a pretty unhealthy kid's cereal only has 12g. Even though raisins have their benefits, sugar is sugar. I tend to pick out some of the raisins, there's a lot in there. My other go-to cereal is Honey bunches of oats, and that only has 8g of sugar.

review/summary: My dogs love this!
review/text: What can a person say about a dog treat. They are all the same, right? Wrong. I have tried so many treats on the market that I can't remember half of them any longer. I like the Old Mother Hubbard Meaties treats for dogs...chicken flavor. First of all the size is perfect to use in training your dog. So many of the training treats out there are just too small or too large. These treats are the perfect size. I usually get the chicken flavor but with the extra chicken added. It comes in Lamb and Liver flavor too. When I yell to my dogs that I have a 'special treat for you' they come running, which is what I want. They even know where I keep it and poke it with their noses while they wait impatiently for me to open the bag. I make them sit before I give it to them. They love the flavor of the extra chicken treats and never turn it down. I like it because of the size and my use in training with the dogs. I usually buy them 10 bags at a time because I go through them so fast. It's one of my favorite things to reach for with the dogs. The price has continued to go up on this product but so has it for other dog treats as well. I also like the fact that Old Mother Hubbard uses only a good quality of things in their products.

It's one of the few ways I can get them to come on back home when they are out in the back yard. I just yell that I have their chicken treats and they come running. I go through them very quickly as I use them for treats all the time. They are just great for training, small, yet bite sized where they feel like they are eating something. The taste must be good to get my two dogs to do things they don't like to do. I buy them all the time. Old Mother Hubbard makes quality dog food and treats and I recommend this to all my friends that own dogs.

review/text: I was introduced to rice seasoning by a Japanese friend and I've enjoyed every one of the eight or so seasonings I've tasted. I found Kimchi Furikae recently at a local Asian store thought I'd try it, so glad I did it's the best I've tasted so far! In fact everyone who's tried it loves it, especially the kids. Unlike the others, this one has a light crunch, it's a tiny bit spicy (chili & wasabi...but it doesn't seem to bother my 13 & 8 yr old's or our neighbors 6 yr old), it slightly sweet too..why the kids must like it. The entire thing was gone in a week! Love it & would order her if the shipping wasn't $5.95. Going today to pick up a few from the Asian store for $3.59. Just sprinkle over rice but best if you form balls out of sticky rice & sprinkle on top like my friend from Japan show me. Enjoy!

review/summary: Excellent Cappuccino/Coffee Mix!!
review/text: This is my first experience with Caffe D'Vita; and I'm so glad I chose this as my first flavor!!  From the reviews, and the picture it sounded very appealing so I took the plunge and ordered!  The great thing about this is that it's not overly sweet (if you have a sweet-tooth and are used sugary coffee drinks, you may have to add some).  It's also 99% caffeine free, so if you want a jolt, simply add it to your normal caffeinated coffee.  I think it's just right the way it is, so I don't need to add extra sugar, or caffeine.<br /><br />  I've only tried it in hot water (adding more than 3 tsp.- since I had more than 6 oz. of water).  It has a slight hint of coconut flavor (hence the "Hawaiian" aspect of it), which added a nice richness to it!  And as a previous reviewer said, it does have a prominent coffee flavor- which is very pleasing!  If you're really desiring more of a specific "flavor" (like Irish Cream, etc.) then maybe some of the other mixes will be more pleasing to your palate.  ..I'm not sure if I'll order some of the other ones, being that this one hits the spot; but I'm sure when I run out- I'll order this again!!

review/summary: If you add sugar it taste excellent!
review/text: It tastes very bitter once you mix it with hot water.  I think it has a lot of raw bitter dark chocolate in it. If you add bunch more sugar it tastes great.

review/summary: Great coconut flavor...
review/text: If you love coconut, you will love this!  Plus it is 0 trans fats, no hydrogenated oils, no cholesterol, and gluten free.  While it may have some artificial stuff in it, at 60 calories, that is less than any fancy Starbucks drink...and costs a lot less.

review/summary: Great gluten free flour!
review/text: I have been gluten free for 3+ years, and have tried many substitutions for regular wheat flour. None measure up to this mix. I have mixed my own using Bette Hagman's recipes, and I've used Bob's, Arrowhead Mills, and Pamela's multipurpose blends...this is the only one that produces the feel (aka, 'crumb') of 'normal' foods. I have found that I do not like the taste of bean flour, and this Authentic Foods blend is free of bean. I have a buttermilk pancake recipe that I use this in; they come out so delicious that even if I could eat wheat, I would keep making them with this flour. Love this stuff, and I love not having to keep 10 bags of individual flours in my fridge. I won't be without it!

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Flour Ever!
review/text: I am not new to this product and I must say it's great!  I have celiac disease and it's super for anything you use regular flour for.  Toll House chocolate chip cookies (recipe on back of bag) are probably my favorite--they taste just like they were made with real flour.  Delivery was prompt and accurate. Anyone gluten free will agree using this flour beats mixing your own!

review/summary: Best Gluten free flour you'll ever find!!
review/text: My daughter has been living with Celiac's disease for 3 years now, and we have wasted more money on all the different kinds of flour's available.  Some were so so in taste, but the Multi Blend Gluten Free flour by Authentic Foods, stands far and above ALL the others out there!  It looks, smells, and tastes just like regular flour! It might cost a little more, but for all those of you out with a gluten intolerance of some kind, you won't disappointed in this purchase.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112CND8">Multi Blend Gluten-Free Flour</a>

review/summary: amazing flour
review/text: I have spent an unbelievable amount of time and money experimenting with gluten free flours and mixes...this flour is by far the best!  I use it cup for cup replacement for chocolate chip cookies, pancakes, banana bread, etc.  Thank you for making my gluten free child's life better! I just wish Amazon would start offering it with the free super saver option, or in bulk.

review/summary: Very Good Flour
review/text: This is a very good basic flour that can be used in recipes to substitute for wheat flour. It is based on what is called the "Wendy Wark" recipe. For those who don't want to go mixing up a lot of different flours this is a good choice. I tried it and then went out and made the mix myself. However, doing this required going to three different stores for flours. As I was setting up a gluten-free pantry I didn't mind but for those who want less hassle buying the mix is a good way to go. I use it for scones and quick breads.
