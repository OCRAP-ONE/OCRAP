review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: Kitchens of India have created a wonderfully simple and tasty curry dish.  The best part of it is that all you add is water and the chicken or turkey.<br />  It has a great flavor and is perfect for those leftover days when you don't know what to make.

review/summary: Tasty but way too salty!
review/text: I purchased this when it was a lightning deal last week.  I love Indian food and was excited to try this.  It's tasty and easy to prepare.  However, it is very salty!  The label says there are 480mg of sodium in 1/4 of the package (which translates to 20% of the recommended daily value).  The next time I make this I'll have to add more than the 1 cup of water that's in the instructions.  I also ended up adding about 1/2 cup of yogurt to take down the heat of the spices.  I don't normally have a problem with spicy foods, but I felt this curry was more on the hot side despite what other reviewers said.

review/summary: Excellent for an "instant" (sort of) curry paste
review/text: For a product in this category -- near-instant curry paste -- this is an outstanding product. It won't beat good recipes made with love and attention from scratch, but it is really excellent otherwise.<br /><br />The butter chicken is easy to make. Just mix this paste in with butter, water and chicken. Actually I don't use water, I use milk for a slightly thicker, creamier version. My wife actually prefers that I use sour cream instead of water or milk to make it even creamier and thicker. So there is room for some variation with this.<br /><br />I have never used the microwave recipe, just the stovetop recipe. I don't think I'd trust the microwave in terms of actually cooking the chicken all the way through. But that's just me. Call me conservative.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but don't be afraid to experiment a bit to get the flavor you want from it.

review/summary: Fire the chef and outsource dinner to Kitchens of India
review/text: How can you miss with a delicious Indian dinner that only takes about 5 minutes to prep - which is mainly just cutting 2 chicken breasts into bite-sized morsels? Paired with my favorite Indian fast veggie side dish of frozen peas sauteed in cumin seeds and ginger powder along with basmati rice, this tasty treat had even my fussy kids requesting seconds. A dab of plain yogurt was all it took to soothe my little one's fried tongue. Tandoori chicken had been the spiciest food he had previously tried. Now they all want me to fire the chef and outsource dinner to Kitchens of India!<br /><br />This reviewer, who has been to India four times but had never previously opened a packet of curry paste in her life, was extremely pleased with the taste and simplicity of this product. Over 90% of reviewers have given it a four or five star rating, an exceedingly high rating for any item, which is what got me to try it in the first place. Most of those in the minority thought it too salty, an opinion which I do not share, and a defect that is very easy to remedy (e.g., by adding chopped tomato).

review/summary: Great Sub for Maple Syrup
review/text: I have a 14 year old son whom I just got custody of and I have been trying to curb the processed sugar intake ... the vice he would not let go of was cheap maple syrup. I tried everything - the pure organic and he hated everything ... until this. I highly recommend this as it gives him the flavor he wants with just the right amount of sweetness and I can rest easy knowing he isn't putting processed sugars into his system.

review/summary: WOW.... Real Maple flavor with low glycemic index
review/text: I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of the Maple Flavored Agave Nectar.  I wasn't disappointed. This is an outstanding product for anybody who is trying to limit sugars but wants "real" flavor- and not some second-rate product in the "disease" aisle.  This stands up to a premium quality maple syrup without the risk of blood sugar spikes.  I can see this easily becoming the only 'maple syrup' I ever buy.  I can't wait to try the blueberry and raspberry flavors for sweetening fruits :)  I already use the 'light' agave nectar in baking with outstanding results.  GREAT product.... can't recommend enough.  I will mix with about 2 teaspoons of melted butter for the flavor of the "lady-shaped bottle" brand.  But I think this will be even better. It's great just tasting a dab on my finger !!!

review/text: My husband and I are very health conscious, for ourselves and our 3 yr old toddler. Instead of the usual syrups with high fructose syrups, we had been looking for alternatives that aren't too high on the sugar (its 50 gms of sugar for real maple syrup as opposed to only 15g with Madhava Agave nectar). We really like this product, and definitely recommend it..

review/summary: I LOVE THIS GUM
review/text: I have been chewing Peelu gum for many years and I really love it. The quality of the gum has always been consistently good when I buy it at Whole Foods and Mrs. Greens. I bought some online, not from an Amazon dealer, and the quality was not as good. So I can highly recommend this product when purchased from Whole Foods and Mrs. Greens. I love the peppermint and the spearmint flavors and the cinnamon is nice too. I really like that it doesn't have aspartame/nutrisweet (and all it's other names like phenylketuronics) as that gives me headaches. I also like that I can buy it in bottles of 100 or 300. It is a good product.

review/summary: If taste matters then skip this product
review/text: I'm an avid gum chewing person who has been trying to switch over to natural sugar free gum.  Initially I purchased this product due to the price being cheaper than it's main competitor spry.  What a mistake that was.  Actually this product is no cheaper after you spend 4.99 on shipping and also count in the additional time you have to wait for the product (4 -5 days) to be delivered.  The product tastes great initially but after about 5 minutes of chewing it tastes like crap. It leaves a very nasty after taste in your mouth. I'm forcing myself to chew it so I don't feel like I've wasted my money but it's not worth it.  The Spry gum tastes soooooo much better and it lasts.  Also I've tasted the variety of Spry flavors and they are all good.  So my final recommendation is to save your money on this product if taste matters. If it doesn't matter and cleaning you teeth is the key issue then go right ahead and torture yourself.

review/summary: Save your money
review/text: This gum is not worth the money.  There are far better Xylitol products out there for sale.  This gum's taste lasts less than one minute before it is spent and tastes like an old shoe.  Additionally, about the time that the flavor goes bad the gum turns to mush and does not even resemble gum at all.<br /><br />Most Xylitol gums that I have tried to not last that long but this one by far is the quickest to go south.<br /><br />I have had much better luck with others, you probably will as well.

Below that it says "PRODUCT OF CHINA OR TURKEY'. Just thought it would be worth while to note though. I bought it for 1/10 of this price. Let's see here... The sticker says 5.96. They don't taste exceptionally good. I would only use them for cooking. Not worth the purchase as $6 (or $60)can get me a whole canister(s) of "Deluxe" mixed nuts from a name brand. Perhaps I should sell mine as "used". I only ate 2 nuts out of it so far and would easily settle for $20 :)

I do, and was really pleased to find a provider who could deliver the chocolate-flavored only. The candy arrived quickly, which is good, b/c this is Florida and sugar melts in the heat. The tootsie pops arrived in a fully packed, gallon size, unmarked ziploc bag -- this surprised me at first, but the pops are the real deal, not fakes. My guess is that the candy mafia buys bunches and bunches of regular bags of tootsie pops, then separates them by color (or maybe they have an inside connection:-)). Frankly, I'm thrilled someone is willing to do the work for me! I will definitely order from them again.

review/summary: Every bit as good, if not better, than conventional chocolate chips
review/text: I tried these chocolate chips after hearing rave reviews about them from vegan and gluten-free bloggers that I respect.  I can understand why they've gotten so much hype.  They taste every bit as good as chocolate chips that do contain dairy (and in my opinion even better) plus they can be enjoyed by people who cannot have dairy or gluten.  They were also picked as a best chocolate chip by America's Test Kitchen.  After going up against seven other brands (including many popular and premium brands) they were the winner, which reinforces their quality for me.<br /><br />The ingredients are as follows:<br /><br />Evaporated cane juice, unsweetened chocolate cocoa butter, roasted soy flour, soy lecithin (an emulsifier), pure vanilla extract.<br /><br />Overall, these are awesome chocolate chips.  If I had done a blind taste test I would have never known that they were vegan.  They are a litle more expensive than conventional brands, but still in line with premium brands which given they are delicious as well as dairy and gluten free, is worth it for me.

review/text: I must admit, I didn't know what to expect.... I ordered the 24- sample pack to try them all.  I had high hopes for this flavor, but from the first sip, I couldn't stand to finish it.  To me, it tasted like grass and dirt.  I eat fresh cucumbers and they really don't have a ton of taste, so I'm thinking the majority of the flavor is probably from the lemongrass.  If the taste of lemongrass is appealing to you, you might like this.  I prefer the Lychee Watermelon and Apple Pear.

But as a baker, it's been really tough to come up with something GF that has the mouth feel and flavor of either home baked or store bought bread and muffin products. Udi's products have solved that issue. The bread tastes like real bread, and doesn't break when you make a sandwich or bite into it. The muffins are so good that you wouldn't guess they are gluten free (they actually have crumbs!)--particularly if you've been trying other gluten free products out there. I highly recommend Udi's products!

review/text: If you are gluten free, the search for bread and pizza, and maybe bagels, is a real quest.<br /><br />After eating Ener-G for a couple of years, I tried Udi's at my local Trader Joes.  I started with the hamburger buns (fantastic) and then tried the hotdog buns (fantastic and a great substitute to make garlic bread.  Udi's bagels are just round pieces of bread - not really a chewy bagel and reminds me of the Lender's frozen bagels.  But this white bread...wow.  Toast it up, put butter on it and you are back to the pre-gluten free mindset.  Was so good I had 4 pieces of toast in a row!  Kind of has the big nooks and crannies like Thomas' english muffins but has a really good bread flavor.<br /><br />By far the closest thing to real bread.  Now to find good take out pizza...

review/text: I'm fairly new to the gluten-free world as I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease only a few months ago. I have tried several gluten-free sandwich breads, and Udi's is the best I've tried. It looks, smells, and feels like an upscale version of regular sandwich bread. The flavor is great, and the bread is soft and yummy right out of the bag. Toasting it makes the flavor even better, and the bread also makes great french toast. If you are in the market for a gluten-free bread that is delicious right out of the bag, this one is for you. It is about $3.99 a loaf at the local Lowes Foods store (in the frozen food section), and it stays fresh for a couple of weeks once it's thawed.

Unlike other reviewers I disagree that this bread is all that great from an absolute view point, it's only quite good compared to other GF breads.<br /><br />I like the taste of the bread in a relative sense, it is a bit flavorless but toasting brings out more of the flavor. I find this bread to be quite good when toasted, buttered, and eaten with a savory soup.<br /><br />The one thing I really dislike is that when toasted it becomes somewhat dry and brittle and the crust becomes rather hard. Toasting the bread on setting "3" of "5" turns the bread into a dried out brick. The bread is very easy to over cook in this manner. Straight out of the bag it's not a very soft bread but it's not hard either. If a regular bread had this texture I'd say it was getting just a bit stale.<br /><br />Considering the lack of quality GF bread products, Udi's is probably the #1 pre made GF bread, especially in terms of being able to find it easily at a variety of stores.

review/summary: Great bread
review/text: I've only used this bread toasted, but I thought it was great.  I stored it in the freezer until I popped it in the toaster; I think you can also store it on your counter if you want to use it for sandwiches.  It was soft and yummy...no aftertaste.  Honestly, you could have told me it came from a bakery and I would have believed you.  I've had some GF breads before and made several loaves; I think this could make very good garlic bread too!  My hubby thought it was good too and he's not GF.  I'll be buying this again; I did not buy this bread from here, but at my local grocery store.  But I thought I needed to write a review because I look at Amazon reviews before I buy stuff.

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: I've ordered as many different gluten free breads as there are available. Let's face it, most of them suck and the only reason we buy them is because we have little choice in the matter. BUT ... this product surpassed my highest expectations! The slices aren't tiny ( think ener-g), the didn't crumble upon a touch and when toasted ( I wasn't brave enough to try it untoasted) it tasted ... well ... like bread! I bought a case since I live in the country and I'm already placing my next order. If you need to eat gluten free and miss bread, give this one a try.

review/text: Loaves sell in my local grocery store for just under $4/package. This is great toasting bread, and makes wonderful grilled sandwiches. It's less great straight out of the bag, but that's true of pretty much all gluten-free bread. The slices are thick but small, as is the whole loaf. My one complaint would be (similar to other Udi's products) that the size of the slices can vary significantly from package to package, and sometimes there are giant air bubbles baked into the bread that renders several slices useless for certain types of applications. Still, it's a good product and if you're not making your own bread, this is a solid choice.

review/summary: Great taste; less filling:)
review/text: This bread has a beautiful color, crumb (texture) and taste. But we will not buy the case anymore as the slices are small, like the little cocktail loaves you can buy at the deli (not GF bread) for tea sandwiches. It should not be called "sandwich bread" as that is deceptive. As mentioned, you have to use 4 slices to make two sandwiches just to eat a regular lunch size meal, and then the price is outrageous, even by GF standards.<br /><br />We have been gluten free for 16 years, so we are used to expensive GF foods in tiny packages. The problem here is that it isn't really a "sandwich" which is what most people want to put in their lunchbag. Also, that means a lot more crust, which no one likes.<br /><br />So just be warned, that a case will not go far, but overall the bread is good if you have a young child who is just learning to eat GF becuase it tastes "normal."

review/summary: Only gluten free bread my 8 year old likes and will eat!
review/text: My 8 year old was recently diagnosed with Celiacs and, after purchasing numerous GF breads and bread mixes to try, this is the only GF bread he likes and will eat.  It is the most child-friendly GF bread we have found by far.  I just wish the loaf and slices were "regular" size and not "play food size" like another reviewer aptly stated.  Not only is it super expensive when you look at the price compared to the small size of the loaf but the size of a two-slice sandwich is ridiculously small almost to the point of being comical.  That being said, the best thing about Udi's is that it is "shelf stable" and can be stored on the counter and doesn't have to be/stay frozen as freezing GF breads (which most grocery stores do) seems to contribute to their hard texture and tendency to be crumbly when thawed.

If you have purchased books on celiac disease and eating gluten free, well then you may have come across a suggested supplier of baked goods ([...]).  Millet and Flax bread, and best of all real tasting bagels (I order the cinnamon raisin millet and flax bagels).  Udi products are far superior to those of Glutino (save your money).

review/text: I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease, and so I naturally began looking for food substitutes. I tried several different kinds of bread before my colleague told me I absolutely HAD to try Udi's bread. So off I went to whole foods to spend nearly $8 on a loaf of bread. I was so excited to try it, but I was extremely let down. First, the pieces of bread are roughly the size of children's plastic play food. They are ridiculously tiny! Second, the slices, even after they are heated/thawed, have the feel and taste of styrofoam. It's  very bland (in my opinion) and the texture is just revolting. I am dying for a squishy piece of bread that is large enough for an actual sandwich. I will absolutely keep searching though, because I believe there has got to be something better out there.

I used to give her those chews a few times a week throughout her entire life, then one day when she was 15 years old she got real sick right after I had given her one of those chicken chews, and she was lethargic.  I took her to the vet and they said she had developed Kidney Failure.  That was the beginning of the end for her.  The results were from the Hartz chicken chew that I had given her...and it was Melamine Poisoning.  In back of the Hartz package it says, "Made in China."  If you are reading this, you may want to read the following website from the FDA:<br />[...]<br />Chiquita died from Kidney Failure, and all it took was one Hartz chicken chew that had Melamine to destroy her kidneys...and it came from China.

review/summary: My cats liked it the first day, but now they don't
review/text: My cats seemed to like this food the first day, but now they avoid it. I like the ingredients which supply a good amount of protein and no grains like corn or rice which are species-inappropriate for cats who are obligate carnivores. We've had cats that we feed only premium cat foods and they still ended up eventually with diabetes or kidney disease.  I can't help but wonder if it was all the corn and grains that are in commercial cat foods that caused this.  Or maybe after a cat lives to be 16 or 17 years old they are likely to have these problems anyway?  This food is made in the USA and the ingredients look like a good balance for our cats, at least from what I've been able to understand after much research.  I like that the pellet size is quite small because we have a few older cats that don't have many teeth and even those that do have all their teeth tend to swallow a lot of dry foods whole.  I wish they liked it.<br /><br />Here is a list of the ingredients:<br />Turkey Meal, Chicken Meal, Pea Protein, Chicken Fat (preserved with mixed Tocopherols, a source of Vitamin E), Peas, Potatoes, Dried Egg Product, Herring Meal, Salmon Meal, Ground Flaxseed, Pea Fiber, Natural Flavor, Sweet Potatoes, Whitefish Meal, Blueberry Fiber, Cranberry Fiber, Choline Chloride, Apples, Blueberries, Carrots, Spinach, Cranberries, Canola Oil (preserved with mixed Tocopherols, a source of Vitamin E), Taurine, DL-Methionine, L-Lysine, Potassium Chloride, Calcium Sulfate, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Zinc Sulfate, Ferrous Sulfate, Niacin, Folic Acid, Biotin, Manganese Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Calcium Pantothenate, Thiamine Mononitrate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Riboflavin Supplement, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (source of Vitamin C), Zinc Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite, Cobalt Carbonate, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Yucca Schidgera Extract, Rosemary Extract, Dried Lactobacillus Plantarum Fermentation Product, Dried Enterococus Faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Casei Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophilus Fermentation Product.

review/summary: Canola oil is bad
review/text: This is a very condensed version:  Canola oil was originally pushed by the farming industry to fatten up pigs, but it quickly made them sick/killed them.  So much money and effort had been invested in producing canola oil that lobbyists then tried to push to market this stuff as "health food" for humans.  It's just as bad for humans as it is for pigs.  I'd assume then that it is equally bad for cats.<br /><br />Also, while it might seem like fish is a good thing for cats, I recently had a cat quickly develop kidney disease after I started feeding him a lot of salmon thinking I was doing a good thing.  In trying to find ways to help him to recover, I came across some vague but interesting information suggesting a correlation between lots of fish in the diet and kidney disease in cats ....<br /><br />I'll leave it up to you to research these points if you are concerned about them.<br /><br />I, for one, am very frustrated in trying to find decent pet foods and the b.s in marketing.  I especially get frustrated when something is marketed as a "natural diet" for cats, but the ingredients list things like sweet potatoes and berries.  While I know that cats might naturally consume partially digested plants via consumption of their plant-eating prey, I doubt they are getting very much.  Note that cats are designed to consume things like mice and birds.  Many birds eat meat, and mice like meat as well (we are mostly talking insects and scavenging here).  Even if a cat ate a mouse that happened to have eaten plants, the amount in the mouse's digestive tract would be so minute as to be essentially meaningless.  It's ridiculous to market products with the idea that a cat's natural prey would every day be stuffed on foods like sweet potatoes and blueberries.  Cats do eat grass, and we can of course solve this issue by giving our cats grass.<br /><br />I would cook exclusively for my cats, but they like having some dry kibble on hand; hence my dilemma....

A relative of mine purchased this for me a few months ago (in fact I still have it and I'm almost done with it) and when I asked them how much it was, they said $15. It's priced $25 here. "Mixed nuts," 40oz, clear plastic jar with blue plastic top, from Kirkland-same as in the picture. Anyway, on my very fixed income, I need something more economical and the price at $25 or even $15 is a little too steep. If you can well-afford it, purchase it, if you can't, I'd definitely try to shop around.

review/summary: Stale nuts
review/text: Recieved my order today, opened the Kirkland container and was immediately dissappointed when I ate the 1st nut.  It was stale and dry.  Tried a few others and found them to be dry and stale too.  I asked my wife to sample them, and she tried the cashews (only nut she likes).  Her opinion was that they were OK.  I asked if she would serve them to friends and family and she said she would.  Our tastes do not usually conflict like that.  I was going to return them for refund, but I guess I will keep them.  I will not be ordering from Kirkland in the future.  Every nut I have ever bought from Walmart has been of better quality and flavor.  The price of the Kirkland nuts (60.625 cents an ounce) is high, specially after I factor in my perceived impression of quality.<br />High quality good tasting nuts are a treat in our household.  Walmart is just a few miles down the road...

review/summary: Yum great chicken!!
review/text: I was quite surprised when I received these chicken breasts, wow were they ever so good. The best thing I liked about these chicken breasts even though they were frozen solid when they arrived, when you cooked them, they did not lose their flavor at all. I loved the taste and the size of each breast, how easily they heated through,however, I really loved the taste.
