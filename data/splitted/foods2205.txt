review/summary: Quite hard crystals not as good as others
review/text: I got this and "Course Gray Sea Salt" from Brittany both from Amazon. The crystals in this salt tend to be very hard and hence are more like little stones than anything else and also do not impart as much flavor as you eat them added to your meal.<br /><br />I have not tried grinding them up. The other salt was not as hard crystals and added a lot of good flavor to the meals I added it to (sprinkling a little on top).<br /><br />I will not get this again. I will get the other again.<br /><br />It will last you forever unless you are a salt junky looking for high blood pressure, as this amount of salt is a HUGE amount of salt in you want to stay healthy. Just a tiny bit with each meal is plenty, and that is the problem here! The tiny bit doesn't impart much flavor or texture. The Brittany did.

review/summary: Fantastic -- But ...
review/text: This is fantastic stuff. It's my favorite of all the flavors Fabrique D&eacute;lices makes.  But honestly, I walk three blocks and buy it for just under $6 at Gourmet & More on Gough Street in San Francisco.  I can't understand the price or paying the shipping.  I'd buy a terrine or use a loaf pan and make it myself rather than pay these kinds of prices.  There's a whole classic text on making terrines and pates at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080942925X">Terrines, Pates & Galantines (The Good Cook Techniques & Recipes Series)</a> and you can watch Julia Child do it on The French Chef.  It's as easy as making meatloaf.<br /><br />Beyond that I'd go to the Fabrique D&eacute;lices web site and see if you can buy it locally in your area.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Wrong item shipped
review/text: Diffefent type of Manuka honey was shipped. The item picture shown on the amazon page is with green cap and manuka flower illustration on white gackground, and clearly said "100% raw certified."<br /><br />What I was received was totally different package. With blue cap and with no "raw" statement at all. This was the same product I saw the same one at my nearby health store and I've been avoiding to buy it since I was not sure if it was really raw.<br /><br />I felt like I was cheated.

review/summary: CONTAINER SECURITY SEAL BROKEN
review/text: Concisely, when I received the Manuka honey in the mail, I was dissapointed to find the security seal broken; that is, when I unscrewed the lid of the jar, the white plastic disk merely fell off, no tamper seal. My choices remained three-fold: (1) Use a different retailer and trash my $40 honey jar, (2) Risk my life and consume thusly, and or (3) Send it back or trash the item. Sadly, the retailer either: (1) Sent the item as received [and no tamper seal exists], (2) the retailer pulled the old "switch-aroo", and or (3) the retailer diluted and or contaminated my food product. Finally, in the event I receive a sealed container from said seller, I shall update my response accordingly; find a different retailer.

review/summary: Excellent honey
review/text: I ordered this honey under the Subscription program in which Amazon will ship you the product at the schedule you set. This gave me fifteen percent discount which helped to bring the price down to palatable level (no pun intended).<br /><br />The Jar I got from Amazon does indicate it is 100% raw and 20+ rating. It does not indicate if it was certified by a recognized organization in New Zealand. UMF certification is done by an independent organization and nowhere in the jar is that indicated. I would feel much better if this was done and it would have merited a 5 star.<br /><br />I did have a teaspoon to taste it and it is very pleasant taste, the color is lighter and creamier than the previous Manuka Honey I had. The last one I got was certified to be UMF 10+ and had darker color and deeper taste.<br /><br />This jar indicates the 20+ was an indication of Peroxide activity. I did not know that Manuka honey had peroxide activity and that explains the disinfection nature of the honey!<br /><br />Overall for the price I paid for it is a very good honey and will find out whether it does do what it is supposed to do when I get a wound or a sore spot and will report it here accordingly.

review/summary: LABEL IS MISLEADING
review/text: I purchased this honey believing the the Bio-Active 20+ rating was equal to a UMF registered rating.  After further research I realized I did not get what I thought I was ordering.  Guess that was my fault by not researching more than I did before ordering.  The taste is good and I will use it for other than medicinal purposes - but feel I paid way too much for what I received.  For those who don't know, the label must include the UMF� 12-16+ rating to be true New Zealand tested honey.

review/summary: Wasn't the best topical usage
review/text: I've done a ton of research on Manuka Honey and know all about the UMF ratings, which is why i bought this product.<br /><br />My sons suffer from extreme cases of eczema all over his body and I've tried pretty much every type of medical cream, ointment and steriod medicine. nothing works or only works for a very short time until the scars and patches come back in full force and every doctor constantly shakes their heads and offers pity because they see how bad it is and they can't give me any other meds that will work. i didnt need their pity, i needed a cure. So i've turned to holistic medicines to help my boys and heal their skin. There is no known cure yet for eczema, but I figure if I can help relieve the itching and stop the scratching as well as heal the skin at the same time, well that's as close a cure as i can get and that's good enough for me. the honey has very high antiseptic properties, supposedly even higher than the generic hydrogen peroxide bottles you buy at the store, so when i would wrap up my son's scars with a gauge and the honey he would scream and holler in such pain and agony because it burns and stings him. this went on all but 2 times for two weeks straight. it killed me inside to do this, but i really needed to see if this stuff worked since i read its also used on burned victims in hospitals and seriously scarred people. i dont know if the honey worked but the pain and itching didnt stop and the healing never happened because it did nothing for the scratching.<br /><br />Im not giving this product a bad review, but i personally didnt find a satisfied use for this. perhaps it would need to be combined with something else, but as far as using it as a stand alone product it didnt work. so my search goes on to find a cure. I'm going to try and combine the honey with other things and see if that works.

review/summary: Not sure if I got a bad batch, or if the tea is just MEANT to be this watery and heavy on the anise flavor!
review/text: Being a lover of good, spicy, full-flavored Chai, I was SO eager to try Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's Chai tea capsules for my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SH6UQ4">CBTL Kaldi S04 Single Cup Brewer, Blue/Silver</a>! Well, I tried my first cup today, and am sorry to say that it's my least favorite cup of Chai ever.<br /><br />My tea brewed up very weak, looking more like dirty dishwater, and smelling like licorice with the slightest hint of cinnamon. I really couldn't tell if there were any black tea leaves that'd even been brewed. The description on the front of the boxes states that these capsules, in decreasing order of ingredients, contain black tea, cinnamon, anise star, anise seed, black pepper, ginger root, and licorice root. For me, having mixed up my own Chai tea spice blend to add to my standard cup of Chai or black tea, the above ingredient list has very few spices that I'm used to tasting/seeing in a traditional Indian cup of Chai. Where are the cloves, nutmeg, and cardamom that are standard in traditional Chai, as further defined in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764135775">The New Food Lover's Companion</a> (one of my ever-updated, all time favorite Foodie go-to guides)? Not here. Instead, those more standard, and more palatable, spices are absent, having apparently been replaced with the more European anise seed and star anise. It also doesn't help that the black tea that's listed first is absent in the flavor profile here.<br /><br />I wonder if proper, long brewing and long steeping of a good cup of tea is just not do-able with the CBTL Kaldi brewer, considering how quickly the heated water is forced through the capsule. Either way, since I've now got 35 more of these capsules that I DON'T enjoy the flavor from, I suppose I can just keep them on hand and hope that I have some guests over that REALLY like the taste of licorice in their tea. Because I really don't, and that's all that I tasted here. Oh well...

review/summary: Chai needs to be pumped up a bit
review/text: I love my CBTL and the rest of the tea choices in their inventory, but I have to say I was very disappointed in the Chai offering. The flavor is faintly there and with the addition of water for brew the spices become fainter. I don't mind the anise; I've had Chai locally that included anise in the chai spice infusion. There just needs to be more spice presence; it needs to be stronger so when water is added the taste comes through. I hope CBTL reformulates their brand of Chai<br /><br />Edited to add, I didn't realize the Chai should be brewed as a long espresso until recently. Makes it a whole lot better ; ) So I'll add a few more stars

review/summary: Tastes like black licorice, not chai!
review/text: I have to agree with the other reviewer - these chai tea capsules are awful. I love chai tea, but this smells and tastes like liquid black licorice. The lack of actual chai tea flavor & the fact that I hate black licorice makes these pods a big disappointment. I've tried adding the CBTL french vanilla powder to a cup of this tea along with some milk to create a chai tea latte. Although doing that helps cover up the licorice flavor & makes the chai tea drinkable, it still doesn't taste very good. I'll stick with my Oregon Chai Tea Latte powder mix for making an instant chai tea latte.<br /><br />Another con - these pods (actually, all of the tea pods) leave tons of grounds in the bottom of the coffee mug when they are brewed.<br /><br />I realize the Kaldi was only recently launched, but I hope The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf plans on introducing more pod flavors in the future (an Earl Grey and a jasmine green tea flavor would be nice, along with hot chocolate pods).

review/text: I don't drink a lot of straight tea but I'm a fan of the Chai Tea Latte.  Using this capsule plus the CBTL vanilla powder (and of course, milk) makes a great latte!  My only complaint is that the cost does add up quickly since you need both the tea and the powder to make their chai latte.  But it's a nice indulgence when you want it.  And a great alternative for non-coffee drinking guests!  Can't say enough good things about the CBTL capsule system.

review/text: This review refers to: Newman's Own Cafe Almond Biscotti(2 pack of 10 oz.)<br /><br />Newman's Own Organics brand has teamed up with Green Mountain Coffee for a great cup of coffee that is certified organic and fair trade at a reasonable price(comparatively).and makes for a good deal all around.<br /><br />The Almond Biscotti flavored brews up with a wonderful aroma. The coffee is made with organic Arabica and Organic Almond Flavor. The flavoring is just enough to give a nice added little treat for coffee lovers without over-powering the great taste or smoothness of the coffee.<br /><br />Certified Organic means the coffee is grown without chemicals; better for the environment; better for coffee lovers. You only get the taste of naturalness.<br />Fair Trade means the farmers get a fair price and are better able to take care of the land they use to grow the coffee.<br />You get delicious and naturally grown coffee.<br />Newman's Own is known for the donations to charitable causes - Its a Win-Win-Win cup o'coffee!<br /><br />Also - at this time the deal for the two pack is excellent compared with other brands that are organic and fair trade (even the Newman's Own is higher in most supermarkets.)And personally I think it makes a way better cup of coffee than the "designer label" brands.<br /><br />Wake up and smell the Almond Biscotti and...enjoy.....Laurie<br /><br />P.S. - Coffee arrived well packaged and pretty fast.

review/summary: Unexpectedly sweet
review/text: I've really been slacking lately on reading product labels before purchasing new things, so when I grabbed a chip out of the bag and discovered it was sweet, I hadn't been expecting it. But sure enough, right there on the ingredients list is "evaporated cane juice". They're by no means a cookie-like chip, but I wouldn't call them savory by any definition of the word. That said, these really complemented some fire roasted red salsa I had on hand, and I also think these would be really great to eat with fruit salsa (that fruit-only, dessert kind of salsa that can be made with strawberries, kiwi, etc.). There aren't really any store-bought chips out there that work well with that. I took off a star because I personally like the Food Should Taste Good ones better because they taste more natural. The sweetness of these does build a bit if you're eating them on their own, which is probably due to the apparent sugar sprinkling they have.

review/summary: Good alternative from RTF
review/text: My daughter was BF exclusively until about 5.5 months. She was supplemented with Enfamil at the hospital because of low birth weight. She was painfully gassy the first three months of her life, so I was a little nervous about her transition to formula. Tried the powder version and she hated it, so I tried the RTF since that is what they used at the hospital. She loved it! In the beginning I mixed half-n-half of the Enfamil Premium Infant with the Gentlease, then slowly transitioned her to the Infant version completely. However, the 32 oz. RTF cans were getting expensive, so I thought maybe the liquid concentrate would be a nice alternative and maybe she won't notice the difference? Well, she didn't notice. I tasted it and it tastes the same as the RTF. (Yes! I tasted it. I taste it each time I make a batch to make sure the formula isn't bad.) I'm hoping that I can eventually transition her to powder when she's a bit older, but if not, then this concentrate works fine.<br /><br />As for performance, it doesn't cause any gas issues for my daughter and she seems to digest it fine. Truthfully, I don't think the Gentlease was any easier on her digestive system than the regular Infant Premium (may be due to her being older and her digestive system maturing), but I didn't want to take any chances since she was VERY (VERY, VERY) fussy during her gassy days. She still has her daily BM (no different than when she was BF) and I like that this formula contains prebiotics for easy digestibility. It last for up to 48 hours in the fridge in an airtight container and you mix equal parts concentrate to water. On a side note, the formula bought (2/2012) from Amazon had a long expiration date (12/2012), which was nice since I bought some from another vendor and it had an exp date of June 2012 (which meant it had been sitting on the shelf for a bit).

review/text: ****<br />I really enjoy this white tea from Tazo. It's a subtle and gentle white tea with subdued flavor, which is how I like my white tea. The apricot flavoring is pretty strong, but apricot is appealing to me, so I don't mind. The vanilla is noticeable as well, but secondary to the apricot. There is nothing not to like in this tea; my only criticism (and the reason for only four stars) is that I can tell that it is "flavored" instead of having real ingredients. Still, it's a fine tea, and one of Tazo's better teas at that.<br /><br />Friends of mine who aren't as fussy as I am about their tea really love it---it's different and enjoyable!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/text: Our 5 month old Puppy loves this food.  We use the kibble as treats for training as well.  From all of the research I've done, this is a very healthy option, and in just a few weeks her coat is silky and she stopped shedding hair altogether.<br /><br />She tried Vennison this morning and loves that as well.  Next up is Salmon.

review/summary: Discontinued, I found a (decent) substitute
review/text: I was very sad when I found out this was discontinued, it's my favorite popcorn! After much trial and error I found a way to replicate the flavor pretty well. Take a bag of the powdered cheese sauce mix out of a box of Annie's macaroni and cheese and mix it with around 6 Tbsp oil and stir. Pour over hot popcorn and voila! I have tried a few other brands besides Annie's but they haven't worked out as well. Kraft was the worst, they must put thickening agents in their powered cheese because when I mixed it with oil got REALLY thick and gross. I put it on the popcorn anyway, and it made it taste slimy. I've only tried this with Annie's cheddar and white cheddar flavors, but I think it would taste good with others. I put this mixture on the cheddar cheese popcorn Orville made to replace the cheddar cheese pour over. It requires a teeny bit more effort, but it's worth it if you REALLLLLY loved the cheddar cheese pour over. I hope this helps!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQ6KTM">Annie's Homegrown Totally Natural Shells & Real Aged Cheddar Mac & Cheese, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Not up to "POUR OVER CHEDDAR"
review/text: I have had an Amazon Subscription for Orville Redenbacher Pour Over Cheddar popcorn for a very long time because I really enjoyed it; when I was notified it would no longer be available, I ordered the Cheddar Cheese Microwave Popcorn that was recommended, but was fairly disappointed by it.  It lacks the texture and also the essential flavour of the other, so I will not be renewing my subscribe and save.  This product is powdery and rather dry, but flavourful enough; but it isn't quite what I'm looking for.

review/text: Well I'm disgusted with Orville Redenbacker for canceling the pour over cheddar popcorn as with all the other reviewers maybe the pour on's were to expensive and people wanted more for there money so they bought the regular instead. I have seen in Sam's wholesale were you can buy liquid butter if you want to pour on your popcorn for better taste because after you eat one of the pour overs you just cant go back to the cheaper styles. I wonder why they don't do the same for cheese? If any body knows were I can find it let me know!

review/text: I am not sure on what planet this would be considered cheddar flavored popcorn, but I can assure you it's not on the planet Earth.

No one in my family enjoyed it and after popping one bag, the rest are headed for their final resting place in some garbage dump somewhere.<br /><br />Cherise Everhard, October 2010

review/text: I work in a rather fun office environment and I always get a little bit of a kick when I make this popcorn.  You see the smell is just horrible (think dirty feet).  But I love the expressions I get from my co-workers when I pop this in the microwave at work.  They immediately start complaining that they feel light headed and will then usually crack a door open to air the smell out.  Why do I keep eating this stuff?  Because my parents keep mailing it to me in gift baskets (I live overseas).  I don't have the heart to tell them this popcorn is disgusting.  I add Cheddar Cheese flavoring to this popcorn that comes in a little shaker, it makes the popcorn taste a little better.

I'll guarantee you though, if you're old enough to remember doing it this way...you'll be better off and much happier with the finished product than you will be with the O.R. cheddar flavoured microwave pop corn.<br /><br />I fully intend to contact O.R. and request they refund me my money!  The last time I was this disappointed in a microwave pop corn (no matter the brand) was when I accidentally left it in the mic too long and scorched it really bad.<br /><br />DON'T BUY THIS FLAVOUR!!  You've been duly warned. Only reason I gave this product one star is because the process won't let me give it ZERO stars!

review/summary: Just as horrible as everyone else says it is...
review/text: I was beside myself with excitement to find this popcorn at the local Stop & Shop!  Brought it home, and gleefully took a pic to send to a popcorn-loving friend in the UK to make him jealous.  Turned out the joke was on me, as this snack was beyond disappointing.  My first inkling that I was not going to taste anything as remotely delicious as Smartfood was when I caught a whiff as I hovered over the microwave.  I thought it might be a combination of nasty leftover smells and chemical cleaning fluids, but no... it was the popcorn.  I sniffed in vain for any hint of cheddar aroma, alas, 'twas not to be.  I opened the bag and out poured a cascade of product the color of cautionary traffic cones... I knew disillusionment was close at hand.<br /><br />NO cheesy flavor.  Barely even buttery.  Saltier than usual.  Just awful.  I'm not sure I want to eat the other two bags.  Even if I closed my eyes to the fetid fluorescence, my tongue and nose wouldn't let me pretend it's just plain buttery popcorn.<br /><br />Another brand used to make a pretty good cheesy popcorn (maybe Pop Secret?  Act II?), but it was discontinued for some bizarre reason.  It CAN be done, but Orville fell flat on his face with this.  Wish I had seen all these other reviews before I wasted the money.

review/text: I'm always looking for quick, healthy, easy to make snacks for work. I love microwave popcorn and various cheeses therefore you can easily imagine my excitement upon discovering Orville Reddenbacher's "New Flavor" Cheddar Cheese popcorn at the grocery store. After trying not one but all three bags over the past week, I have never been so sickeningly disappointed. I thought maybe the first bag was "stale or bad" so I tried the 2nd and 3rd with the same results. It doesn't even taste like popcorn, let alone cheese. I tried a light sprinkle of salt but that made it worse.  It tasted nasty.<br /><br />From now on I'm only buying generic popcorn from Kroger, Marsh, or Aldis and adding my own seasoning.

Zero cheddar flavoring at all in this, seriously, I threw away my bag after a bowl. The rest of the bags are going in the trash too...

Won't be buying again for this reason.<br /><br />It doesn't taste that bad, but the artificial cheddar flavoring has a characteristic aroma that reminds me of a musty textbook from school (to my nose, that is).<br /><br />IMO Smart Balance is the best choice, especially with their patented blend. Any microwave popcorn isn't suitable for those in need of watching his/her sodium, as they are all high. Just that Smart Balance has the best buttery taste to me.<br /><br />That said, you should take my advice and try it at home--even those where I work don't like the smell of buttery popcorn in the morning.<br /><br />One last note--why don't they have natural flavoring? Common sense--dairy would spoil and make you very sick. Enough said.

review/summary: My bassett hound LOVES his food now...
review/text: Canidae has definetly proven to be a tasty, balanced source of food for my dog.<br /><br />Initially i had started my new pup on IAMS because of its popularity - but after reading the ingredient list and hearing the the IAMS corporation had just been sold (therefore not keeping the quality of their product) I decided I needed to provide my hound with a heathier source of nutrition.<br /><br />I volunteer at the local Human Society Shelter and a friend of mine there suggested that I try "Canidae". At first I was hesitant because of the cost - but when i read the nutrition facts and saw REAL, all natural ingredients, i felt confident enough that the price was worth it.<br /><br />Before i started feeding my bassett Canidae he would only eat once a day (placing a full bowl of food down for him in the early morning on my way to work...he would wait until late at night to eat AFTER I had my dinner and slowly munch on a couple bits here and there). The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food.<br /><br />Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime. Occasionally I will cook up some frozen vegetables with an egg and mix it in his food for a little variety, but I havent had to do that in a while.<br /><br />If you love your dog and care about his/her nutrition, I suggest giving Canidae a try.

review/summary: Good price for a highly rated dog food
review/text: I feed three large dogs and one small dog with this dog food.  I've used it about three months.  Formerly I used a well-known brand that I assumed was good since it was well-known and readily available at stores everywhere.  I decided to change when I did some internet research showing my old brand was considered to have inferior ingredients.  I have to say that I have seen good reviews on the ingredients of this dog food, but I cannot say I notice anything in particular about my dogs since changing other than they seem to enjoy it more and seem to be satisfied with less of it.  Perhaps one dog who has skin problems is better, but I can't swear the dog food is the cause.  So, relying almost entirely on internet proclamation of quality, I give this a hearty recommendation.  And, the price is competitive to lesser rated dog foods.  And it comes directly to your door.

review/text: I bought the chicken meal and rice formula because I suspected my 8 year old Lab mix might have a food allergy related to corn or soy. Well, she does not. However I did learn a lot about dog food in the process. According to [...]  Canidae rates four stars whereas as everything on the shelf at my local Wal-Mart rates only one star. I was considering Blue Buffalo and other brands but they were $15 or higher in cost.<br />  I saved money buying Canidae and received dog food with the highest quality ingredients! I highly recommend it.<br />  One thing I must note. Some dog owners have reported reactions to changing to this brand. Although Canidae gives detailed instructions on their website on how to transition your dog to new dog food, they do not give these instructions on the bag. I strongly advise you to visit their website.

review/summary: Great choice for the active young dog!
review/text: I'm the owner of a year and a half old beagle boy.  He's the love of my life and when I got him from our local rescue they emphasized how important a proper diet of a premium dog food is.  I'm not one to be sucked into the belief that if it costs more, it's better.  That said, in terms of dog food, it's important to find a food made of fresh ingredients with no corn byproducts.<br /><br />My little guy eats a bowl of this per day and he has cured the constipation problem he was having before we switched foods.  He seems to really like the taste and to make it a little easier on his teeth, I add water to it to soften it.  That seems to do the trick since the kibbles are decent sized and might be a bit much for a smaller dog to take on.<br /><br />What's also nice about this is ordering through Amazon Prime and getting the heavy bag shipped for free to my door with two-day shipping.  This is by far the most reasonable price I've come across for a top-brand dog food.  Try a smaller bag to see if your pup takes to it and go from there.

review/text: I ordered this after reading a ton of awesome reviews and in hopes that it may hope with my dog, Kitty, a 65 pound, 2 year-old pit bull's recent issues with her skin. It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough. By word of mouth at work alone, I've converted over ten people since switching at the beginning of the year (2011).

review/text: I would have spent the big bucks to order top-rated Blue Buffalo, but was shocked to learn that there was a recent wholesale recall of Blue Buffalo products. Canadae is much more inexpensive and just as nutritious. My dogs love it! They seem much healthier since I've switched to this brand. The folks that sell this are wonderful. Canadae was shipped to me free of charge (Amazon Prime.) It was carefully packaged: no rips, tears, or leaks. I highly recommend.

review/text: We could not be happier with this food, we have two labs who had problems with their old food Nutra. Male would have diarrhea at least once a month and the female would have to be watched to make sure she would eat her food. We switched to this after a vet recommended a grain free formula to one of our friends labs who was having problems with his coat. After researching different food brands we decided to not purchase the science diet brand the vet recommend and we went ahead and ordered canidae salmon and potatoes. All the problems stopped as soon as we switched. Our male has no more accidents in the house and the female runs to her food when it is time to eat. They both have more energy and their coats look amazing. Great food and we recommend it to all of our friends and family for their pets. Our dogs health is worth the extra 20 dollars over the pet store brands of dog food.

review/summary: best food out there
review/text: Hands down, this brand, or Blue Buffalo, are the best dog food out there, providing your pet doesn't need a special hypoallergenic brand of food because of illness or allergies.  Canidae use all natural, human grade ingredients in their foods.  My 3 pit bulls smash a bowl of this stuff and love it.  I recently switched my Blue pittie to the single grain formula however, because of persistent rashes she has been having lately (haven't been able to determine if it's all outdoor environmental and/or caused by a food allergy?)  She seems to do better on the single grain.  Nevertheless, I've been feeding my dogs this brand for over 4 years and am a very happy and loyal customer.  Even with the skyrocketing prices of grains and other foods, the price hasn't wavered in 4 years.  Not bad.  If you're feeding your dog trash like Science Diet or Eukanuba, switch over to this and you won't be disappointed.  Worth every penny.

review/summary: Cost effective & so far a good alternative
review/text: We have a 52lb Basset/Beagle/who knows. For the past few years Boing has eaten a grain free + low gluten dehydrated food. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QF363W">Honest Kitchen Force, Grain-Free Dehydrated Raw Dog Food w/ Chicken, 10 Pound Box</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QW022C">Honest Kitchen Keen, Low-Gluten Dehydrated Raw Dog Food w/ Turkey, 10 Pound Box</a>  But with finances compromised had to find a cheaper option & having completed extensive research decided to give Canidae a try. So far it's 50% HK & 50% Canidae while transitioning to the new food  & in the next two weeks he will be entirely on Canidae. I will update this review after a month to see if his wonderfully shiny coat remains like that & if he remains "gas" free. If so it will be a great find & tremendous saving. Unlike other dogs Boing did not experience the change of formula & so has not had the unfortunate stomach upsets. Another real plus was getting free shipping which helped with the overall cost. Due to health issues I have to be extremely careful of what he eats & as yet I have not seen any ill effects. Have given him the chicken grain free, this flavor & have 2 more to try. He isn't a finicky eater which helps. More in a month or so - hope this helps anyone looking for a decent alternative to the usual big name dog foods.

review/summary: Great Food for high energy dog with digestive problems!
review/text: At 40 per cent high quality protein, this is great food for a young, healthy, very active dog. It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea. That's why the Canidae seems so miraculous.

review/summary: Food for my picky puppy
review/text: I am feeding her this currently while mixing it with the Innova (which is very expensive and hard to find) that her breeder is feeding her. I love that the price is slightly less than other premium, holistic foods and I can get it shipped to me on Prime 2 day shipping.  It's also for all life stages, so I like that if this continues to work for her, I won't need to switch to a different food as she gets older.<br /><br />The ingredients in the food are great, and I especially like that there are pro-biotics.  Because the nutrients are so concentrated, I know that one of these 35 pound bags is going to last me a very long time with one growing puppy. At the same time, I had a difficult time getting her to eat the food (I guess it just didn't smell appealing to her).  I have had to mix it with a little pureed pumpkin and a tablespoon of the Canidae canned food of the same variety to make it a bit more appealing. At the same time, this could just have to do with my picky Lhasa-Shih's taste buds and not the food.  I know that several people who use the premium food are thrilled at the small amount of stool.  Personally, my puppy has still had larger stools at least twice a day (some of this could be from the Innova which she is being weaned off of).  Lhasa's are known for having sensitivities to allergens, and I love that this food is so gentle on her stomach.<br /><br />Mostly, I love that this is carried by Amazon and it can get to my house so quickly and easily. It is hard enough for me to pick up a 35 pound bag of dog food while I'm putting it in a plastic bin (let alone carrying home from the store as I live in a metropolitan area where I take public transit).  Great service and good product.

review/summary: Dog developed GI problems
review/text: Our 6-year old Vizsla has been eating Canidae for 3 years. A month ago we switched flavors from Bison to Sea Salmon.  We gradually transitioned the change even though it was the same company.  Within four weeks on the new flavor he developed a set of distressing systems including soft, mucus covered stools, horrible gas,low energy, staggering walk, excessive drooling, licking and constant neck extending (difficulty swallowing).  A vet visit confirmed these as diet related.  We put him on a chicken/rice diet and his symptoms stopped after just two days.  Doing research to decide whether to switch back to bison or go with another company, I found a great deal of  information about other pet owners having issues with all flavors of food from Canidae. Consumer Affairs reports a pending class action suit.  We have decided to switch to another company.

review/text: My two Rhodesian Ridgebacks and one Labrador Retriever are no pushovers.<br /><br />Even other varieties of highly regarded Canidae food have left them looking up at me over lightly rearranged bowls of food with that 'Why have you turned against us again?' look.<br /><br />But whenever I bring home the thirty-pound bags of Canidae Chicken Meal and Rice, the dogsters nose hungrily around the car before I can even get the stuff out of the trunk. I've long since settled on Canidae (for its reputation as nutritious and high-quality) and on the Chicken Meal and Rice (for the predictability factor with my threesome).<br /><br />Things just got better, however, when I realized that my Amazon Prime membership allows me to order a thirty-bound bag for second-day delivery at no cost (in fact, it usually arrives the next day) at a price lower than what I was paying locally.<br /><br />This has allowed me to move to a just-in-time delivery service, which cuts down on the storage needs and may be attractive for other owners of multiple and/or large dogs.

review/text: I've been feeding my dog (75 pound Golden mix, about 5 years old) Canidae for 3-4 days now, and she absolutely loves it! She's always been a picky eater, often ignoring food in her bowl, but she laps this up as soon as I put it in.  I've been mixing it with her old food to ease her into the transition.  For the first two days I did 75% old food, 25% Canidae.  Today I've done half and half.  No tummy problems.  If anything she seems to have more energy.  The only thing is that now I have to really police how much food I give her, whereas with her old food I knew she would only eat it if she were hungry. But I'm happy she's happy! I'm also happy to have found a food that seems to be much better quality, and for a price that's within my tight budget.

review/text: My Boxer have tried various dog foods. He started with Nutro as a puppy but after a year, he started not liking his food so we switched to Science Diet. After much research, found that Science Diet did not use the quality products... so we switched to Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Adult Dog food. My dog loved the food but realized he had allergies to one of the ingredients. So we changed to Canidae and he loves this and has no allergies.<br /><br />When My husband and I researched good quality dog food, we found a lot of great quality dog food and most of them were pretty pricy but we found Canidae and Chicken Soup to be the best quality for a good price. I would recommend Canidae Lamb Meal and Brown Rice to any dog owners. My dog has been on it for about 6 months now and its been great!

review/text: Our Rhodesian Ridgebacks were on this food some years back and we moved, thus losing access to it at the new location. I am very glad to see Amazon carrying Canidae and that it's available using the Prime Membership! We have fed many, many dogs the Canidae when we we were fostering rescue dogs (an average of 3 new dogs a month for years) and it was the only food NONE of them ever had any trouble eating & digesting. Our own pack has a couple of members with soy allergies, so I'm careful about what we feed. They have been back on the Canidae for a few months now with no drama at all. The switch from their old food back to the Canidae was easy and stress free and all 6 dogs scarf it down like it was prime rib. (or you know...a squirrel) Even my father's Chihuahua likes it and that little diva used to think she could only eat human food! I have been able to cut back by a half cup on the daily ration for our largest dog as he was putting extra weight on with his previous amount from the old food. Everyone's coat is soft and shiny, they all have loads of energy and are generally in excellent overall health - that doesn't happen with the grocery store bargain foods. Again, I am VERY VERY glad to see the big bags of Canidae available from Amazon!!

review/summary: canidae dry dog food
review/text: My dog got horrible diarrhea from it.<br />We mixed it with her old food for about a week and after that gave her just the Canidea food.<br />Too bad, it seemed like a good brand though.

review/summary: I ordered this for the benefit of my allergy dog.
review/text: It just came in, and to my disappointment, it contains barley...which she is allergic to.  That is NOT on the ingredient list, so beware.  Fortunately my other dog can eat this.<br /><br />Amazon, please keep the ingredients up to date!

review/summary: Beware new formula!
review/text: Canidae has changed the formula of their ALS recipes.  Many, many dogs have become ill after eating the new formula.  The web is full of complaints from dog owners whose dogs are experiencing the same awful symptoms (Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, hot spots and even seizures).  Do your homework before buying this product.  The company changed the formula without notifying the public.  Would give zero stars if possible.

review/summary: Look at the ingredients after chicken meal!
review/text: I've heard this is a good food, but was shocked to see after chicken meal so many grains. I did not feed this to my dog. I'd rather pay more money for better quality food. All those fillers are unneeded. I expect such a highly regarded company to have better ingredients. I always look for by products but didn't think to even bother to check the next 4 ingredients. Highly disappointed.

review/summary: New formula (Aug, 2008) is no good
review/text: This has given my young dog persistent loose stools. My older dog also had problems with loose stools on the adult formula, which was immediately rectified by a change to Innova. See the large number of serious complaints on the web about the new formulation before buying.

review/summary: My dog lost too much weight on this food.
review/text: I have a two and a half year old female Boxer that has allergies to most commercial dog foods, so I keep her on a diet free of wheat, soy, and animal by-products.  Canidae seemed to fit the criteria and was available at my local pet store (whereas, the brand I was feeding, Evo, had to be ordered), so I wanted to try it.  I've been feeding my dog three and a half cups of Canidae dry dog food daily (divided between two feedings) for about five weeks, and she has lost a significant amount of weight on this diet.  She is a very active dog that has always been lean, but she is now too skinny. I will be switching back to Evo and would not recommend Canidae.

review/summary: Problem Dog Food
review/text: I purchased Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula for my two Cocker Spaniels (Cavalier King Charles and American breed).  After about two weeks, the problems began.  Diarrhea, some vomiting and general malaise.  Further feeding resulted in more problems.  We had fed them Blue Buffalo and Eukanuba in the past but had never experienced these kind of problems. We returned to Eukahuba and both pets have returned to normal. I'm unsure what ingredients caused the problem but I will never use this product again and recommend caution before feeding your dog this food!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGZ2L2">Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula, 30-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: Country Roast is a Great Coffee
review/text: I was a Folgers Classic user before I tried the Country Roast and there is no comparison between the two.  Folgers Country Roast Coffee is the best Coffee I have ever used. It has a great aroma and a taste that is out of this world. This is the only coffee that I will drink from now on.

review/summary: The best instant coffee
review/text: I love this coffee.  The inulin that is added to the mix makes it a very filling beverage and takes my appetite away for the whole morning.  The coffee is an instant mix with milk and the powder should be poured over very hot water to get it thoroughly dissolved.  I have been buying it for over two years and I drink it every morning.  I usually find it at some selected Asian markets.  Not every store has it and I'm delighted to know that now I will be able to order it through Amazon.

review/summary: Wonderful, Unusual Candy
review/text: My kids, and I, love this candy. The Indian restaurant we go to once a month or so keeps a bowl of it at the host stand, and it's all I can do to keep my kids from filling their pockets and making little pigs of themselves over it. The owner of the Indian restaurant said this was his favorite candy growing up. It's crunchy and tastes like honey and sesame.

review/summary: Seller of this item sends you cheap knock-off! BEWARE
review/text: Candy Express sent me cheap no-name knock-offs of the actual Joyva brand which is the brand I wanted. This no-name (no logo on package) stuff they sent doesn't taste as good either. I'm VERY disappointed, I will be reporting them to Amazon for ripping me off as this is false advertising. BEWARE do NOT deal with Candy Express. I will have to buy them locally I guess.

review/summary: love the crunchy, sweet seame seed candy! (purchased thru Amazon)
review/text: Both my husband & I love this item!!  I introduced him to this candy/food item about 1 year ago.  He does not much care for what I call "foreign" or "ethnic" food having grown up in the mid-west, with mid-western parents whose mother cooked standard "meat and potatoes" meals.  I have tried to introduce him to middle-eastern, chinese, and all kinds of other foods.  I think I snuck this in for him, he is now about addicted to it!!  Initallly, I had ordered the largest amount I could find (in bulk) and together we have now finished it all.  So, of course, I had to get more!  We are making a good start on this next batch from Amazon. It is just as good as the first batch I had purchased, and for this one, I didn't have to pay shipping!  Yaay!

review/summary: Fantastic "candy"
review/text: Tasty & addictive!  I remember as a child, my mother used to bring these treats home from the health food store in the late 70's/early 80's. I loved them then, and still do.  My children now love them, too.  Although technically a "candy," these sesame-packed treats aren't that bad.  At least real sugar and corn syrup are used with honey, as opposed to High Fructose Corn Syrup, which is the "bad" type of corn syrup.<br /><br />We are making our own sesame & honey pasteli now, so that we can be sure of the ingredients.  They cost more, due to the local, small-batch honey and Lyle's Golden Syrup we prefer, but it is worth it. I think these Joyva sesame honey crunch wafers are the next best thing to homemade.  My shipment came in a plastic bag, weighed the 3lbs I purchased, and were individually-wrapped with Joyva brand wrappers.

review/summary: My friends jokingly call this "Miracle Tea"
review/text: I discovered this tea in a little cafe in Costa Del Sol, Spain. It was a particularly cloudy night and I was not properly dressed for the occasion (as the weather was deceptively hot during the day). As I began to feel worse and worse and watch the snot drip down my nose, my group went into a cafe and I asked for chamomile tea...but they didn't have it. Instead, they gave me the closest thing to it - tila tea.<br /><br />In just one sip of this tea (with only sugar added and nothing else), I felt all of the mucus clear out of me. Apparently linden flowers are particularly good at doing this and a few other remedies.<br /><br />For such a cheap price (shipping of course is a little high because it has to be exported from Spain, so buy two boxes to make yourself feel better [and to save money]), I highly recommend this product. Never had an issue with the vendor either.

review/summary: Strongest Tilia tea
review/text: This, Tila / Lindenflower tea is the strongest I have tried.<br /><br />The content gets this gooey effect when it's wet i.e. there is no way to suck it dry after infusion, but you're not supposed to do that anyways :-)<br /><br />Otherwise it has the medicinal properties I was looking for. It is great before going to sleep.
