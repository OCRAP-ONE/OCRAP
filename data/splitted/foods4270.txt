review/summary: YUM!
review/text: Your nostrils will flare at the aroma of this tea from the opening of its envelope to the last drop of tea from your cup. Amazingly fresh-tasting (and smelling) mint tea. This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!

review/summary: Great Green Tea!
review/text: I drink a ton of green tea and recently purchased this from Amazon.  I like to try new green teas every once and a while, but I think I found my new "everyday" green tea.  I was looking for an organic green tea without all the caffeine (since I drink it so much) and believe this is probably the best green tea I have ever consumed.  FYI: I only drink this green tea cold and use 5 or 6 bags to make a gallon.  Buy this green tea with confidence if you like to make a pitcher and drink it over a couple days.

review/summary: Natural, Mild, Subtle Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/text: I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it.

review/summary: Bitter Green Tea
review/text: First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit "add to cart" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought "oh, boy" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The "burnt" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . .

review/summary: This tastes like CINNAMON OIL, not a traditional chai blend
review/text: Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed.

review/text: I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a "burnt" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away.

review/summary: This is a staple at my house
review/text: I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of "tea time," where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic "bite" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the "subscribe & save" option, this is an especially good deal.

review/text: I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment.

review/summary: Excellent Mellow Tea, Hot or Cold
review/text: This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet.

review/summary: Lovely Green Tea
review/text: I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil.

review/summary: My Favorite Tea
review/text: I have been drinking this tea blend for over a year and never grow tired of it.  Love the blended flavor and the oil of bergamot.  Being organic and fair trade certified is also a plus. To those of you who have tasted earl grey black and green teas separately and are curious about the mix--I would say the black tea flavor predominates, but the result is an extremely satisfying tea blend.

review/summary: The BEST green tea.
review/text: THIS is my morning addiction--not coffee.  I've been drinking green tea for years, and I've tried many brands.  I keep coming back to this one though.  One mark of its quality is that the brewed tea is actually *green*.  If your green tea looks brown, then the tea has oxidized and it is of much lower quality.

review/summary: My 'everyday' tea. :c)
review/text: I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)

review/summary: Time for Tea!
review/text: I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too.

review/summary: Better than Bigelow's Earl Gray Green
review/text: I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good.

If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!

review/text: This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste "green" (ie: doesn't have that fresh "grassy" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again.

review/summary: Cuppa Green
review/text: Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are "watered down" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market.

Tom Yum soup portions<br />2.5 cups water<br />10 med. uncooked shrimp (optional for flavor and protein)<br />1 tsp of fish sauce (optional but added for more authentic flavor)<br />1-2 tsp lemon or lime juice (fresh or bottled)<br />1 tbsp coarsly chopped cilantro<br />1 sm. can of mushrooms (better to use canned as it is already soft and cooked)<br /><br />Heat pot on med. right before boiling point, drop shrimp, T.M. paste, fish sauce, lemon juice, mushrooms, noodles, and packet of dried veggies in pot. On med. low, cook for 5 min. Right before turning off heat drop in cilantro. Pour and enjoy.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good
review/text: I tried both the Tom Yum and the Kim Chee soups and they both are so good!  The Tom Yum is a bit pungent (whatever is in the salt has quite a smell to it) but it mixes in beautifully.  I could see the flavoring might not be for everyone, though.<br /><br />I've found that rinsing the noodles as per instructions does very little.  I can separate them out just as well with my fingers.  I've also found microwaving is not required.  You can get a nice soup by heating it ramen style.  Simply pour hot water in and let sit for about 5 minutes.  This works great for me as in the office I have hot water closer to my desk than the microwave, so if I'm busy I can quickly grab a spot to eat.

I have found that if you break the noodles into about 4 parts and crumble them up then heat it up in the microwave, you can skip soaking the noodles first and draining them.

review/summary: mixed feelings
review/text: I thought this soup tasted good. I liked the taste and although it's a little complicated to prepare, overall I felt it was flavorful and filling. I feel that the packaging is a bit deceptive though. You are supposed to soak the noodles for a moment then drain, then add two different packets - one with a concentrated flavor sauce and the other with dried veggies and other flavorings. Add more water, cover and cook in microwave for about 1 min. On the surface this is a one serving, biodegradable bowl... BUT the packaging says there are 2 servings per bowl... so the 730 grams of sodium is really 1460 for one meal. tsk, tsk tsk. I think they should have either made the bowl or the serving smaller OR made the label read it as one serving with the true amount of sodium you'll get when you eat this for a meal. I tried separating it in to halves... it's not that easy, and besides.... where would you store the other half?  I guess you could just make the whole thing and throw away the other half, but seems like a waste. I think I won't any more for those reasons, but I might change my mind.IT was quite convenient and tasty dispite it all. decisions, decisions.

review/summary: Good start for your own soup
review/text: First, this product serves as a quick and easy starter to make your own Tom Yum. By this I mean the dehydrated vegetables, spice pack and noodles are a good start, but if you add chicken or tofu or other protein you'll have a more satisfactory meal. It is nicely spicy on it's own for people who like moderately spiced foods.<br /><br />The base flavor is excellent. I spice it up even further by adding a bit of chili paste, rice vinegar and low sodium soy sauce. Speaking of sodium, there's too much in this product to begin, so watch that if you have sodium issues.<br /><br />I wish - when manufacturer's packaged a product like this - they would understand that this is not a "2-serving meal". This is a one-serving meal. The calories come from the noodles, so I use half the packaged noodles and add my own protein and eat the whole thing. In other words, if you only eat half (which is ridiculous for an adult) then you're getting what Annie Chun's calls a "serving". If you eat the entire bowl, you are getting two servings.<br /><br />Long story short...great taste, easy to prepare but too much sodium for a meal.

review/summary: Tom Thumb the Piper's Son is not Tom Yum
review/text: (ASIN: B000E18CVE)  Most of Annie Chun's other meals are cooked in hot water which is drained off. Her "Tom Yum Soup Noodle Bowl" is not.  It offers six ounces, which is not nearly enough for me.  If you are going to live dangerously...<br />I recall reading the reviews of others who felt that one Chun food or another is not as good as restaurants offer.  Perhaps this is one of those, but it has enough character to stand on its own, and Tom Yum doesn't even have to steal a pig for that to occur.<br />This soup bowl comes with a cube of soup base, which I soak and heat first.  Then I add the softened noodles and squeeze out the contents of a flavoring packet, which is quite strong on its own and needs to be incorporated into that which is rapidly becoming soup.  I stir, cover and heat it all for two minutes (I like my soup to have a hot temperature, too.) You could add more shitake mushrooms, a few of which are already hydrated from within the cube.<br />Chop some green onions or scallions, to enhance flavor and color.  At the last, I add perhaps two Tbl. Hunts Tomato Sauce, garlic and onion flavor, and the same amount of Splenda brown sugar, to cut and sweeten the soup just a bit without ending up with a cloying mess.  Blend it all together.

review/text: To preface, I have never had Tom Yum soup before so I cannot compare to others, fresh or otherwise. So take this as a review from someone who just wanted to try it.<br />I ordered this because it was on sale and was healthier than many packaged meals.<br />I tried one tonight and added about a dozen small, frozen shrimp. Next time I will also add some frozen veggies as those dehydrated veggies that are included are really not "wonderful." I didn't think the preparation was overly difficult and with the frozen shrimp thrown in I did microwave for an additional 30 secs (2 min total).<br />I thought it was quite flavorful and had just a bit of a kick you could feel after finishing. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and plan to use them as meals for work. I do not believe I would pay full price, however.

review/text: This is THE perfect sugar-substitute!  In fact, in the book, HOW THE RICH STAY THIN, the author, (a New York City Park Avenue MD), states the following little rhyme:<br /><br />  "First we were pink<br />  Then we were blue.....<br />  Now we're yellow, through and through!"<br /><br />Splenda is that rare item made BETTER by a bit of (semi) genetic engineering.  Don't be afraid though - no other product is combined with sugar to make Splenda Granulated.  As mentioned in "How Splenda Is Made", above, hydrogen atoms are removed from the sugar molecule, and replced by<br />Chloride atoms.  This process takes away 99% (or is that 100%?) of the caloric value of the sugar!  :  )  And what they say is TRUE:  It's made from Sugar, so it TASTES like sugar!<br /><br />Although it is msore expensive to buy SPLENDA Granulated, (in bags), it may well be worth it, if you have diabetes.  I have noticed that the carry-with-you PACKET version of SPLENDA, contains DEXTROSE.....another form of sugar.  That, (I believe), is why SPLENDA in packets is a "free food" for diabetics, for up to four packets......only.  (Any food ingredient ending in "...ose" is a<br />sugar.)  "Sucralose" is the name given to "SPLENDA'S" semi-genetically-engineered sugar.....so of course it is one of the ingredients, in both forms of SPLENDA -- ending, of course, in -OSE.  But DEXTROSE appears as an ingredient ONLY in the packet form of SPLENDA.  It's NOT in the bag form!<br /><br />When I mentioned all this to a SPLENDA represntative, she said it was definitely OK to use the bagged form for sweetening drinks, as well as for baking.  But that the bagged form will FIZZ, slightly, when put into drinks.  This is normal....but somewhat of a shock if you're not prepared for it.  So -- be prepared!<br /><br />As it is so much more expensive to use the bagged , (baking) SPLENDA granuals for sweetening drinks, than the "carry-with you" packets, (and since I was somehow able to lose 40 pounds -- due in no small part to my use of SPLENDA! --and so (horray!), lose my incipient, "Type 3" diabetes), I find I can use both kinds of SPLENDA, with no ill-effects.  I find I buy one 700 packet SPLENDA, to every 3 or 4 large packages of granulated, bagged SPLENDA, that I buy.<br /><br />Recently, (in the 400 PACKET container), the people at SPLENDA have come up with some cute, clever little sayings that uplift the mood, and often bring a smile to one's lips.  Examples:  "It's better to have sprinkled and lost than never to have sprinkled at all". "Have A Sprinkle And A Smile."  "One small yellow packet for man, one giant smile for mankind."  "Let Your Creative Sprinkles Flow",<br /><br />The people who make SPLENDA are both genuises, (finding a way to replace hydrogen atoms with chloride atoms), and creative, (see clever sayings, above.)  Maybe not the same people -- but they all work for the same company.  My mounth curves up, (in a smile!) to them!  : )

First approved for use in Canada in 1991 and later on in the US in 1998.<br /><br />Splenda is multiple times sweeter than the previous sugar substitutes.  Unlike saccharin, Splenda does not have a metallic aftertaste.<br /><br />Another advantage is that Splenda is stable under heat and can be used for baking.

review/summary: Splenda granular sweetener
review/text: I love this product.  In the morning I have half cup of grape nuts with about a cup of frozen wild blueberries from Costco, and milk.  I sprinkle Splenda on top.  It is delicious, healthy and refreshing.  I also use the Splenda to sweeten a bowl of fresh strawberries.  No guilt!

review/summary: Best replacement for sugar in your cooking or baking to reduce you calories!
review/text: My wife and I always try to reduce our calories and especially the grams of sugar.  This product is wonderful as it tastes like sugar and it is reasonable in price.  We use it on our cereal, homemade pies, strawberries and other fruits.  It makes fantastic lemonade and you cannot even tell it is not sugared.  Since both my wife and I are type 2 diabetics this product helps us control our sugar and still get the sense of eating something sweet.<br /><br />One cup of Splenda� has 678 less calories than a cup of sugar.  There are also a lot of available recipes on the Splenda� web site for good lower calorie snacks and deserts.<br /><br />This is an ideal product for those who need to reduce their calories and sugar intake.  I recommend it!

review/summary: Tastes better than sugar!  Impressive!
review/text: I bought this last week for the first time - I was trying to lessen the sugar out of my kids everyday diets.  They can't even tell the difference and I have very picky kids that won't eat anything.  Today they had strawberries with spendla granulated sugar and couldn't tell the difference.  I was very leary of this, since I can't stand the smells & tastes of some artificial sweeteners.  I am permanentally throwing out all of the sugar in my house and just keeping Splenda Granulated Sugar, Splenda Brown Sugar, and Splenda packets... I am going to learn to cook with Splenda, since it's better for the whole family.  I drink a lot of tea and this tastes a lot better in my tea than regular sugar did and no calories!  I am definitely going to be carrying a baggy of this in my purse when I go to restraunts, work, & school events.  This is a fantastic alternative.  I'm impressed.

review/summary: good for those who use a lot of splenda
review/text: Big resealable bag. It's good for those who use a lot of splenda. Even if you don't use a lot, nothing but humans will eat it, so not to worry about it spoiling quickly.

review/summary: Great Diabetic Friendly Sweetener! Highly Recommended!
review/text: "Splenda" is one of my favorite things ever! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for sweet tasting snacks and drinks that will not effect my blood sugar levels. Splenda makes it possible for us to have sweet baked goods, sweet ice tea and coffee again since I don't like "Nutra-Sweet" or "Sweet and Low"<br /><br />Like most diet products it is not perfect and Splenda does not taste quite as good as regular sugar, but it is as close as we have found. It is really very satisfying and has no calories as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
