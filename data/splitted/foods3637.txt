review/summary: not much flavor
review/text: Like many other people who have posted reviews of Ethical Coffee Company's capsules that are compatible with Nespresso brewers, I was excited to be offered an alternative to Nespresso's own capsules.  I have already written reviews of the Espresso and Decaf capsules from ECC, and I intend to write a review for their Indiad'oro variety as well.<br /><br />As to this Cremoso variety, I have to say that I preferred it to the Espresso variety at first because it seemed more interesting even though it was a bit less strong, but after having consumed about 25 capsules I must say that the Cremoso flavor is quite underwhelming.  It doesn't taste bad, but it simply doesn't have much flavor at all.  Even at the current, significantly reduced price -- exactly half the price of most Nespresso capsules available direct from the Nespresso club, I don't think I would order the Cremoso variety again.  It's just WAY too mild for my liking.

review/summary: Too weak, especially the Cremosa
review/text: I use Nespresso Roma, and my wife uses Nespresso Ristretto.  We bought Cremosa and Espressivo as possible substitutes, because lower per-capsule price, free shipping with my Amazon Prime, and I don't have to use the Outpresso to recycle.  But we don't like the coffee. Others may prefer it, I'm sure, but its not for us. Too weak,  and we don't like the flavor.  The Cremosa is especially watery versus Nespresso.  I'm cheap and maybe not as picky  so I will use them up over time, but after trying both Cremosa and Espressivo, my wife will have none of it.  One of life's little pleasures especially for her is good coffee, and these are no substitute.

review/summary: I really wanted to like this!
review/text: We bought a citiz nespresso maker and hate being slaves to the nespresso coffee cartel and liked the idea of Eco friendly pods. This seemed like the answer to our prayers. Sadly not. I've tried two styles of this brand now (cremoso and espressivo) and neither one of them is strong at all!  The flavor is nice, but who cares if you have to put four shots into one coffee? I thought it would be more economical than Nestl&eacute;/Nespresso, but it's not, because I end up havig to use more capsules. Also, there is no indicator on Amazon as to how strong the coffee is, so it's kind of a blind stab. Cremoso was weak to me and espressivo (which i believe is the strongest) was a bit better, but neither did the trick. I REALLY wanted to like them.  I guess it's back to the coffee duck for me, unless they develop a stronger roast :(<br /><br />I'm willing to give it another shot if the come up with a new roast that actually has the power to wake me up!

review/text: First off, the pods jam in my (brand new!) Nespresso Pixie.  Its easy enough to clear the jam, but they should work without a screwdriver. Secondly, the coffee isn't very good.<br /><br />As much as a like a lower priced option, I have to suggest you stick with the authentic Nespresso pods.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: When I bought these they worked out to about half the price of Nespresso pods.  I thought it was a great deal until I tasted the first shot.  This particular variety at least is VERY weak.  I ended up using two pods per shot and it still isn't as strong nor full flavored like genuine Nespresso pods (even something mild like a 3 or 4 intensity).<br />My wife said they tasted like plastic and wouldn't even drink them. Also I had some trouble with them jamming in the machine, but learned to just eject them immediately after it was done.  This was with a Pixie machine.  In short, don't waste your money.

review/text: I have tried the Cremoso and the Espressivo and love them both.  Great for a quick pick me up in the morning and early afternoon - the taste is perfect for me.  Im not one to love extremely bitter espresso's and this has just the right amount of humph!  Another great thing i do with them when it is hot out (and where I from, it gets extremely hot) is pour the espresso in a glass with some almond milk and lots of ice. So refreshing!<br />Bonus is that the capsules are biodegradable - one should always go that route when deciding what to buy.

review/summary: Not good.
review/text: I purchased this product a couple of weeks ago. I was trying to find a product that would work on my Nespresso C-100 Essenza machine but at a more affordable price than the Nespresso capsules. Ethical coffee capsules seemed to be the right product. I soon encountered several issues. First, it was difficult to close the lid of the machine with the capsules inside. Secondly, the coffee that came out was watered down and tasted quite bad. On close examination of the capsules after  using them, I noticed that the machine only superficially perforated the capsule, which would explain why the coffee was so watered down. Thus, I decided to make small holes on the capsules prior to inserting them into the machine. That did help, but the coffee quality was still bad. Even if the coffee was great, I really should not have to place holes on the capsules prior to inserting them into the machine in order for the water to go through it freely!! These Ethical coffee capsules either ARE compatible with Nespresso machines or THEY ARE NOT!  Based on my experience, I must say that these ARE NOT compatible with Nespresso makers. Conclusion: spend a little more money and purchase the Nespresso capsules for your machine. They are worth the extra money. Nespresso capsules work beautifully and the coffee is great. Thanks!

review/summary: Resist Temptation!
review/text: Bottom line, these taste like cheap hotel coffee. Your least favorite Nespresso capsule variety is 100X better tasting than these capsules. Taste is what matters, ECC capsules are awful.<br /><br />This goes for Cremoso, Indiad'oro, Espressivo - unfortunately, I bought all three types. Hardly a difference between them, but I listed them in awful to undrinkable order.<br /><br />However, if that's not enough of a reason to avoid, consider these;<br /><br />-they're difficult to insert in Nespresso machines<br />-they're difficult to remove from Nespresso machines<br />-they frequently blister during brewing, thus "brewing" coffee from the side of the capsules<br />-they are stale right out of the package (though the expiration date reads otherwise)<br />-all ten per box are not quite vacuum-sealed in plastic, hence opening the plastic hastens further spoilage<br />-they are only a dime less than real Nespresso capsules!!!<br /><br />I actually threw away unused capsules, they were that bad. They are not worth free. Quite weak for a company started by a former Nespresso executive. Perhaps they have a serious quality control issue in the U.S.?

review/summary: Good coffee but even better company
review/text: Let me start out by answering the question: Is this the best coffee? No. Nespresso still tates better. They after all are, created the system, have the research, and know what makes the ideal capsule.<br /><br />Will you notice a difference with a shot of pure espresso? Yes, BUT:<br />Will you notice a difference in your cappuccino, latte, or other coffee drink? No.<br /><br />Will you feel better about supporting a company with far better business practices than Nestle, a company with nontoxic, biodegradable compost-able capsules (Nespresso capsules may be aluminum and recyclable but there are still plastics and glues that are not eco friendly in those capsules), and yet are still less expensive by far? Of course! What do you think?<br /><br />If you're worried that the capsule ruin your machine? Absolutely not. They give this guarantee on their website:<br />"Our experience has shown us that the Nespresso Club* may try to make you believe that our capsules damage your machine.<br />This is simply untrue. Our capsules are slightly more resistant.** This has no effect on your machine.<br />As proof, we promise to replace your machine should any problem be caused by one of our capsules as part of the machine's routine use."<br /><br />After doing research I also discovered that the former CEO of Nespresso runs this company, so they clearly know their competition.<br /><br />Bottom line: i will keep ordering these capsules for quick shots, and morning cappucinos and coffee drinks, but I am still searching for something as good as the original nespresso branded ristretto and espresso capsules (as a frame of reference,  my two favorites would be the purple capsule aka the arpeggio and burgundy capsule aka the decaffeinato intenso).<br /><br />Hopefully the other flavors of this brand will make the cut because i love what they do.

review/text: I bought all five of the different types of Ethical coffee capsules made for Nespresso machines.  Unfortunately,<br /><br />1. Coffee flavor-marginal-not great<br />2. Quantity of Coffee-less in capsule than in Nespresso capsule<br />3. We have a brand new Nespresso Pixie. These capsules continue to get jammed in the machine and we have to reach in, struggle with the capsule to pry it loose before we can make another coffee.<br />4. Since 10 capsules are packaged in one plastic sleeve, the moment we open the sleeve, air comes into contact with the remaining capsules minimizing their freshness.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the espresso coffee is not worth the lower cost to purchase these capsules.

review/summary: What a treat!
review/text: My office recently bought a DeLonghi Espresso machine, along with many varieties of espresso capsules to try out.  I was very excited as my love (and pickiness) of coffee and espresso has gone back many years since my first trip to France.  My definite favorite is the Cremoso from Ethical Coffee Company.  My mid-afternoon treat has quickly become a Cremoso double latte.  The aroma and the taste are wonderful, and it is the perfect pick-me-up to get through the rest of my day.  I have ordered a box of Cremoso to have at my desk as my own personal "stash".  My co-workers like several of the other varieties of Ethical Coffee, but my hands-down favorite is Cremoso.  An added bonus is that Ethical Coffee Company (the name says it all, doesn't it?) makes their capsules envinronmentally-friendly and biodegradable. I have been concerned about the millions of plastic capsules that are mounting up in our landfills. I will always support a company that combines great quality with integrity, and Ethical Coffee Company seems to be the only company in the coffee genre that does.

review/summary: These green capsules work flawless on my Delonghi machine and are tasty!
review/text: I bought these pods along with the Delonghi Latissima 720 machine and they work flawless. They did fit the machine and are perfectly ejected after use.<br />It seems that some Amazon customers are giving bad reviews for this product because it is cheaper and it's not Nespresso, which is not the point.<br />Firstly, these capsules are green and compostable. They cannot be a "copy" of Nespresso pods that are in aluminum, which is highly polluting. ECC capsules would be a "copy" if they were made in aluminum too!<br />Secondly, the ECC capsules are not that cheap, there is only a difference of 10 cents between Nespresso and ECC: I am not sure that people that bought a Nespresso machine and used to drink Nespresso pods are interested in a bargain of 10 cents because if they wanted to make real savings, they should have used ground coffee and stovetop espresso makers!!!<br /><br />As a result,<br /><br />THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR YOU IF:<br />* you already have your favorite Nespresso "grand crus",<br />* you like the look of the aluminum capsules,<br />* you love George Clooney Nespresso commercials and keep saying "What else?" each time you drink a Nespresso coffee,<br />* you have the feeling to buy something luxurious each time you go to Nespresso club and you like it,<br />* you don't care about the planet.<br /><br />THIS PRODUCT IS FOR YOU IF:<br />* you don't have a favorite Nespresso "grand crus", and you like espressos in general,<br />* you are not convinced by the recycling Nespresso thing because they did not try really hard to increase 5% of the total current recycled capsules(1),<br />* you think that ECC capsules is the answer to the Nespresso question "What else?",<br />* you like the idea of doing REALLY something to reduce the amount of polluting materials in your daily waste and think that recycling aluminum is not enough,<br />* you don't care about the Nespresso club.<br /><br />(1) If Nespresso/Nestle did care that much about recycling, they would have entice their customers by giving them coupons for empty capsules brought back (as for the recycle of glass for example).<br /><br />Another thing, I saw a lot of reviews saying that these green pods do not work on Citiz or Nespresso branded machines. I am not even surprised. Nestle made everything he could to prevent the Ethical coffee Company to sell their products, but ECC found success in Europe since 2010. If this product was not working and was responsible for breaking machines, we should know it! As a consequence, I am not a conspiracy person but I would not be suprised that some of the bad reviews could come from Nestle itself. We are in an espresso-capsule-war, so this is business!<br /><br />P.S. 1 : I am not working for the Ethical Coffee Company and they don't give me any money for rating their products. I am just a green costumer concerned about his carbon footprint.<br />P.S. 2 : The espresso taste is good! I used to drink espressos and ristrettos from semi automatic professional machines at work, but I did not want to do all the process by myself, so espresso capsule process is the perfect alternative for me! I am not a Nespresso aficionado so I am just talking about espresso here.<br />P.S. 3 : You have to firmly lower the level of your machine with these capsules. FIRMLY. The first time I tried, I was afraid time to break my Delonghi super expensive machine, but it's ok. It's seems to be due to the biodegradable capsule material that is less hard than aluminum (obvious).<br />P.S. 4 : It would be nice if the Ethical Coffee Company could put all theirs different products in a single degustation box, in this way you could choose your favorite flavors and only buy them. Because if you do not like the taste you are stuck with 49 capsules... it's a bit rude!<br />P.S. 5 : It would be great (and logical) if the ECC capsules were really ethical: organic and/or fair trade certified.<br /><br />>>April, 25th 2012<br />After drinking ECC capsules for more than 2 months now, my conclusion is that -- at comparable intensities and blends -- the espresso tastes of both Nespresso and ECC capsules are good, and the differences between Nespresso and ECC are subtle. Since some capsules are compostable while other pollute like hell, I will stick with these green capsules because I hope soon to turn them (coffee+capsules) in compost for my palm trees.<br /><br />>>May, 2nd 2012<br />I've just started to compost the ECC capsules, I am very excited! The capsules should break down in 6 months according to the standard EN#13432.<br />I will let you know how quick they turn into compost! :)<br /><br />Go green!

review/summary: Too expensive for second-rate nespresso capsules
review/text: You know, I was the person who recommended these capsules on the deal sites when they were half the price they are now. At $25, this is a COMPLETE rip-off. Basically you get like a 10% savings for a far inferior product to Nespresso's own capsules. Yes, these are biodegradable but you can bring Nespresso capsules in to have them recycled too. And ANY flavor of Nespresso tastes better than these; Cremoso is a very weak. I would only really use it for lattes, and of course you would need at least two shots to taste anything resembling espresso.<br /><br />I do not work for Nespresso. I wanted to get this out of the way because I myself was suspicious about the poor reviews of this product at first. As mentioned I recommended this product on sites like Fatwallet when it was half the price because some of us are broke and can't afford the far superior Nespresso capsules.<br /><br />I am really pissed off because I wasted my time, directing thousands of consumers to the Ethical capsules, assuming that the capsules were going to continue to be sold at a price that would save people money. Why in the world would a company launch an inferior product at no savings to the consumer? Nespresso capsules produce great tasting coffee, and Nespresso's capsules are sealed until they are used, unlike Ethical's capsules; once you break open Ethical's bag of ten, you pretty much have to use the capsules right away. BTW, these take a long time to decompose in a composter so be sure you cover them for months if you do decide to waste your money on these. Finally, while the capsules do work in my Essenza, it's a very tight fit and lately the Essenza lever kind of pops up at the end of the extraction. My Essenza was two weeks old when I started using these. I will amend this review if the company decides to do what is right, that is not gouge consumers.

review/summary: Not life changing but not bad...
review/text: I was a little surprised by some of the really harsh reviews I've seen so far as well as some of the claims they don't fit the nespresso machine. I have the Delonghi Latissima (the older one, not the new square one released last year) and while it takes a little bit more force to close the door, compatibility has not been a problem. It's hard for me to imagine it fits one machine and not the others...<br />As for the coffee, it's OK- doesn't compete with that amazing vanilla seasonal variation nespresso released this past year, but it's not as bad as the cherry variation either. Its definitely not as strong as the Ristretto or the Appreggio but has much more flavor then the cosi and some other the other weaker blends. I would most compare it to one of the new Lungo blends taken as a short pour instead of the lung pour.<br />I have found them adequate to make my daily cappuccinos and honestly worth saving 30% per capsule vs nespresso. I will buy more!

review/summary: Good base to build from
review/text: I have had and ordered this product many times, in fact I have 5 on the shelf right now. Yes, the sauce is really excellent considering how much sugar is in regular pizza sauce.<br />The crust. I actually don't mind the crust, it gets nice and crispy, and YES it is very hearty due to high levels of fiber needed to counter the carb count. If you are a true low carb eater and looking to have a base to work from this is it. The benefit of low carb is I can add, bacon, italian sausage, pepperoni, etc on top. Those ingredients out way the high fiber crust.<br />Find a lower carb crust and sauce than this stuff and I will look for it. It's not out there. Not to be negative towards the negative review, but I feel many people go into eating a low carb pizza with a mindset that it will taste exactly like a regular pizza, come on, really?<br />This is the best low carb pizza solution I have ever found. Period.

review/summary: worst pizza crust ever
review/text: The sauce was good. The pizza crust was absolutely horrible. Both took one bite and had to spit it out. Low carb doesn't mean food has to taste horrible. The people who designed the crust should be fired and new cook hired to create a crust that is at least edible.

review/text: I give it two stars for recieving my order on time. I compare the size of the package to a bag of Oreos. I was disappointed in the taste of the mochi had a doughy very soft texture and a flower after taste, being that I am use to eating mochi like the ones at Tuttimelon and Pinkberry. If you are considering mini mochi that is compare to Pinkberry I would consider shopping at nutsonline.com Omg the best so far I have bought! I tried to get a refund at Boba tea Direct but when they responed the totally ignored the fact and didnt even mention the refund policy, which I thought was rude! Open the bag of mochi and let it sit for awhile it taste a bit better. I won't be ordering this product again. Customer service was very bad.

review/summary: Not authentic tasting, disappointing...
review/text: I went on a search for mini mochi after getting hooked on them from my local Yolo's.  They have them as a yogurt topping choice and they ARE authentic in taste and texture.  I was a bit worried that when I bought these "Mochi" (3 - 2 pound bags!!!) that it wouldn't have that authentic mochi taste.  My fears were realized when I popped them into my mouth and tasted...sweetened flour.  Ok it's not THAT bad if you aren't accustomed to real mochi.  I'll still eat them and and still use them as toppings at home, but I'm a bit disappointed in these and will not buy them again.

review/summary: Love these snacks!
review/text: I had tried these before from the local Whole Foods and was excited to get them in bulk for a better price and with more flavor selections. Out of all the freeze dried fruit companies, I like Funky Monkey the best (and Trader Joe's brand). They are crunchy, flavorful, and a good portion size for a small snack. I keep them in my desk at work for when I don't have time to shop for fresh fruit, and want something that fills the craving for a crunchy snack. They fit easily on the weight watchers plan. The pineapple and mango are my favorite for straight up and the bananas I like best mixed with oatmeal or yogurt. Very happy with this purchase!

review/summary: Great with oatmeal
review/text: As a stand-alone snack these can be a little weird, they taste good but stick to your teeth. But I have found a delicious use for them - I put them in my plain oatmeal (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M09BQQ">Quaker Instant Oatmeal Regular, 11.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>)(made with milk not water), and cook the oatmeal - delicious! It's great to put some in, cook the oatmeal, and then add the rest so you get some of the crunchiness. It is even more delicious to pair them with complementary oatmeals - like Applemon with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M09AKS">Quaker Instant Oatmeal Apple Cinnamon, Lower Sugar, 10.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>, Bananamon with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001688DDQ">Quaker Weight Control Banana Bread Instant Oatmeal 12.6 Oz - 6 Unit Pack</a>. They are a great, healthy way to add flavor.

The snacks are good and the amount in each package are perfect, not to much and not to little. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I really wish the bags were resealable and they are not. This is annoying if you can't eat it all or don't want to finish it all. What I didn't finish got sticky and spilled all over the inside of my bag :(.<br /><br />Product is great!

I have only had dried fruit a few times (I'm not a fan of fruit really) so I was a little worried whether I would like the flavor or not. Thankfully they included the Bananamon flavor in my sample kit because I loved it! The combination of bananas and cinnamon is so yummy! My children, on the other hand, enjoyed all of the flavors, even the stronger ones like pineapple. They completely devoured the Funky Monkey Snacks--and I have no problem with that because it's 100% real fruit!

[*sigh ...*] again ...<br /><br />here's the nuker instructions from the amazon page re-formatted for readability ...<br />*****<br />Microwave:<br />1. - In a two-quart microwave-safe bowl, cook 1 lb precut (diced) sausage, chicken or shrimp 3-5 minutes on High or until cooked.<br />2. - Stir in 2 1/2 cups water and Zatarain's Jambalaya Pasta Dinner Mix. Blend Thoroughly.<br />(When using shrimp, reduce by 1/4 cup and add the shrimp after the first 10 minutes of cooking. Zatarain's Jambalaya Pasta Dinner Mix tastes great even when prepared without meat or seafood.)<br />3. - Microwave uncovered on High 15 to 17 minutes. Stir occasionally.<br />4. - Let stand for 5 minutes. Sauce will thicken as it stands. Stir before serving.<br /><br />Caution: Cook time may vary depending on the power of the microwave oven.<br />*****<br /><br />it works out fairly well.

review/text: These are freeze dried blackberries and just what I was looking for so I could use them in cereal.<br /><br />They are large, so I use kitchen scissors to easily cut each berry into 2 or 3 pieces.<br /><br />The ratio of fruit to seeds can be particularly low in dried blackberries and while these have noticeable seeds, the ratio of fruit to seed is good.<br /><br />All dried blackberries seem to have an aromatic floral, slightly spicy taste that is not so familiar in fresh blackberries.  While the aroma is there, the effect on taste is relatively mild in these blackberries.<br /><br />They are tart and have a very good flavor.<br /><br />If you are looking for freeze dried blackberries for use in cereal these are great.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I have since tried the Just Tomatoes brand of freeze dried blackberries, sold as Just Blackberries.  The Just Blackberries brand are a little smaller and a couple of notches sweeter than the Harmony House.  They have a little less floral spicy aroma.<br /><br />For use in cereal, the Just Blackberries brand is my current favorite, just barely edging out Harmony House.<br /><br />It's really a matter of taste, if you want large and tart, then Harmony House is the way to go.<br /><br />If you want medium sized and sweet, then Just Blackberries is the way to go.

review/text: If you like the little round candies called SMARTIES, then you'll love these! Ricochet Fruit Punch Mints remind me of SMARTIES from their similar shape, texture, and flavor (but these are better tasting in my opinion). The big advantage of Ricochet mints is that these candies don't use any sugar, so they don't contribute to tooth decay. Instead, they use a naturally occurring sugar alcohol called Xylitol, which tastes refreshingly cool and bacteria have a hard time extracting energy from. I can eat a pile of these after brushing my teeth at night and my teeth still feel smooth and squeaky clean the next morning.

review/summary: Packaging almost impossible to get into...
review/text: I don't really like to write negative reviews, but I rely upon the reviews of others when I'm assessing items for purchase, so here's a summary of my experience with this product. While the flavor of this oil is okay (not nearly as great as I would have hoped based upon some of the Melina's reviews), the excruciatingly difficult and nonsensical packaging is enough to keep me from ever buying this again. Each individual bottle is quite small and then the narrow neck is covered with some kind of wax or foil cover that has no easy means of getting in--and as the top portion is so narrow that the only way to do it was to cut into it with a sharp blade, it would have been easy to cut myself. I finally was able to cut off tiny bits of the overwrap (which seemed to be a bit sick possibly with some minor oil leakage--perhaps from one of the other bottles) after about 10 minutes only to be confronted with a teeny, tiny cork jammed well into a narrow neck of the bottle with no gripper area or way to get the cork out. I tried two different wine openers with one almost pushing the cork all the way in... I was able to salvage it but then the cork was damaged so that attempting to close the oil bottle in any fashion that would preserve the rest of the oil is now impossible. I'm going to need to decant it into something else to keep it protected. The flavor--after the battle to get into the package was over, I'd have to say the flavor was good but certainly not outstanding. The battle wasn't really worth it--especially for the price.

I purchased the Taster's Choice version previously <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Q3UQHE">Nescafe Taster's Choice Mild Original Mix 24/20pc - PMO, 8.5-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> via Amazon. It's just the Amazon availability is very hit or miss. This Classic Mix tastes similar to a mild Cafe con Leche or Cappuccino<br /><br />I just received my order and am now drinking my second cup ....mmm... mild coffee light with cream and sugar. Brings back memories of stopping by my old favorite East Coast Diner on the way to work in the pre-Starbucks era. This product imported from Korea is absolutely splendid AND you cannot beat the price which is also pre-Starbucks...100 cups of coffee with cream and sugar for ELEVEN BUCKS and no wasted pots of coffee either! You just need hot water and you're good to go. :-)

I add a cup of freeze dried potato cubes and a half cup of mixed veggies at the start, along with a bit of parsley and some celery salt. Then it's into the slow cooker on medium for about 4 hours.<br /><br />I reserve one portion for todays meal and freeze the rest in a number of 3 cup storage bowls. Yum!

review/text: First of all, when I took the cap off, there was a clump of goo stuck in the nozzle.  I don't know if this is just settlement from the bottle being in storage a while, or what, but it was pretty unappealing to look at.  Then, when we tested the oil, the jalapeno was extremely faint.  You really had to be looking for it (er, smelling for it, or tasting for it).  Basically this seems like an olive oil that somebody waved some jalapenos in front of.  We probably won't be using it.

review/summary: My Favorite Tea in its Class
review/text: There are three broad categories of herbal tea that I rely on throughout the Fall, Winter, and early Spring:<br /><br />1) Citrus and lemongrass<br />2) Rose hips and hibiscus<br />3) Chamomile<br /><br />For me, Tazo has held first place in each of these categories for the last several years. This is no small feat - I'm cutthroat when it comes to my tea collection! Passion is an absolutely fantastic tea, eking out a slim lead over Harney and Sons Peach fruit tea (mainly a rose hips and hibiscus blend) because it is cheaper, easier to find locally, has a bagged version, and is more-or-less just as tasty.<br /><br />For those of you who have never tried it, you will find it is robust and tart. I happen to love tart, fruity herbal teas and this is the first one that I reach for whenever I feel a cold coming on and I want a heavy dose of bioflavonoids to go with my Vitamin C tablet. It's so strong that I often only steep it for 45 seconds, and then I use the teabag again for a subsequent cup with a fresh bag of something else, like Wild Sweet Orange. Just a tip ;)<br /><br />One reviewer felt misled by the name. There is a category of "medicinal" herbal teas and some of them claim to help people experiencing problems with their libido, etc and I guess this reviewer felt that the name "Passion" should be reserved for such a tea. This is not that type of tea, so look elsewhere if that's what you need.<br /><br />If you like tart, fruity teas, however, I heartily recommend it.

review/text: So, going through Starbucks one day, not wanting a coffee, I came across their "Passion Shaken Tea." I plunked down my money, and found the best drink I've had in a long time.<br /><br />This tea has a flavor that I can't quite place, but don't care--it's so good that I'm actually giving up some of my soda addiction.<br /><br />If you like fresh, tangy flavors, this tea is for you.

review/summary: Fine Tea with Hibiscus Flowers
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet.<br /><br />The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as "berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense". Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, juicy, red fruits".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.<br />****

review/summary: The only tea I drink!
review/text: This tea rocks my world.<br />Never in my life have I enjoyed any type of tea.<br />It's too watery. It's funky tasting.<br />You have to add butt loads of sugar or honey just to choke it down to be polite.<br /><br />One day not long ago, a friend of mine convinced me to try Tazo Passion Herbal tea. I have to say I was hesitant, but to be a good friend, I gave in.<br /><br />One sip was all it took and I was pleasantly surprised and forever converted. I didn't have to add any sugary substance to make it tolerable. The flavor is strong enough that it doesn't taste watery. (Please note that the full leaf is not as strong as the filter bags.)<br /><br />It lists hibiscus, lemongrass, rose hips, mango & passion fruit flavors as ingredients. Since I enjoy things on the fruity side, this was perfect. Tazo's site gives this description for it's taste, "Berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, and earthy dense."<br /><br />This is now my drink of choice whenever I feel like something besides water. I've used it to soothe sore throats and bad days. It's good on rainy days, snowy days, and if you can stand the heat, sunny days. I haven't tried it iced yet, but I'm sure that'll be a treat!

review/summary: Cold or hot, Passion tea hits the spot!
review/text: This fruity, herbal tea tastes delicious hot or cold. It is tart, and I like to add sweetener or sugar to mine. I don't care for honey with this one. In the summer you can use it to make the Passion lemonade, mix it with a lemon-lime soda for a fruit punch-like flavor & fizz, or just pour it over ice by itself. In cold weather, serve it hot for a flavor that's just as exquisite. There are a couple of drawbacks-- one is that it's hard to find in stores, and when you do, you won't get as good a price as you do on Amazon. The other is that when people see the rich reddish/pink color and smell the fruity aroma, they'll be slipping your teabags into their pockets for themselves. I've been brewing it by the pitcher to drink cold this summer and have cut way back on soda as a result. If you don't drink it that often, the bags are individually sealed, so you won't have to worry about them going bad. This is my favorite herbal tea and I bet it will be yours too!

review/summary: Spa Quality Herbal Tea
review/text: This is one of my favorite herbal teas.  It has a delightful flavor both hot and iced.<br />Previous reviewers have indicated they find the flavor very strong - there are two easy solutions for this.  Brew it with a greater quantity of water or reduce the seeping time, both amount to the same thing pretty much.  I'll typically get the equivalent of 3x 8oz glasses per tea bag.<br />I went to a fancy spa last year for Mother's Day as a treat for my mom.  She raved about the excellent herbal iced tea they had in the serenity room.  I agreed with her, and found the taste very familiar.  Sure enough, I saw them brewing it using the Tazo Passion.  So when I want to do an at home pampering day, I'll pop one of these in to brew and voila! Instant relaxation.

I had him go back grab the right kind and stock up. The cost at the grocery store was $7ish dollars and the price per box is $4.67 at the time of my review with free super saver shipping.

review/summary: slightly tart bold herbal fantastic tasting iced tea
review/text: Normally I hate yucky flowery herbs like hibiscus and rosehips in my tea (such as Celestial Seasonings Tea) but one day while at Starbuck's, I was sweating, heated and tired in hot weather and wanted an iced drink but not coffee and since I'm really a tea drinker, I tried their Tazo iced teas and they tasted SOOOOO good and invigorating with just the purrrrfect balance of just enough herbs but still letting your senses know it was still TEA and the fragrance/taste comes out boldly!! The heated tea is nicely turned immediately, boldly, vividly, red in color. I don't need to add much sweetener even as it's tart but its tartness gives it more taste.<br /><br />The only drawbacks are its high price (compared to other teas which is why I'm always waiting for a sale on them) and having to wait to heat the water and waiting to cool it down in the refrigerator (or quickly in the freezer).  It's true as another reviewer said that it's very strong in taste after just leaving it in hot water for a few seconds so the longer you leave it in, the stronger and bitter or more tart it becomes and you could really be frugal and only need a tea bag for a half gallon to a gallon of water.  Adding ice helps dilute the taste as well as cool the tea down fast and cold, but I like my iced tea strong so i can taste its full flavor, so I try never to add ice.<br /><br />It's a delight as an everyday iced tea as well as a great gift for a friend.

review/text: I'm a coffee drinker. Like day in, day out coffee for me please. But I'm terribly picky about coffee and when I'm not drinking coffee I prefer non-caffeinated drinks.<br />This is my favorite herbal infusion. I drink it straight up and hot. It's a very fragrant infusion with a heavy floral taste and scent which may not be to everyone's liking. It's tart verging on sour. I prefer bolder flavors, and this suits very well.<br />My daughter also loves this one occasionally with honey, and it's the only non-fruity infusion she'll drink with any regularity.<br />The color of it is gorgeous, the scent is heavily floral, the taste is floral/tart/citrus.<br />Individually wrapped, I usually keep a bag or two in my purse for when we are some place that offers hot water but no teas that we like.

review/summary: Its spice is good hot or cold, with or without sweetening
review/text: One of the one-star reviews is from someone who apparently believes any product that has teh word "passion" in its title should be an aphrodisiac. "Passion," good man, can refer to non-sexual things, including fervent appreciation for taste. (By the way, "The Passion of the Christ" is not a porno.)<br /><br />Tazo Passion tea is a splendid alternative to regular black tea or sugary drinks; its spice keeps things interesting enough that you don't need sugar, although on a hot day, nothing beats a tall iced glass of Passion with a touch of simple syrup. It's tasty, with hints of berry, and caffeine-free! Also, it works really well for sun tea, something I haven't been able to match with another love, China Mist loose tea. Even the magenta color is a pleasure.<br /><br />The other one-star reviews suggests that the teabags are too powerful! In my book, that means the product is a great value, much better than a tea that requires two or more bags per cup. For a half-gallon of sun tea, six bags is adequate.<br /><br />Amazon has a great price for the tea, especially in the six-pack, because a lot of groceries do not carry it (if there's a Starbucks in your supermarket, the market will not have Passion), and Starbucks is much pricier (and a six-pack is not available).

review/text: You can drink this tea hot or cold.<br /><br />This tea has a very strong flavor to it.<br /><br />I didn't know this, but starbucks sells this too. If you don't mind spending 3-5 bucks, you can try it yourself.<br /><br />This is the real thing. If you have trouble finding this brand/flavor at your local super market, you may consider buying here.

review/text: Tazo Teas are the finest of the herbal teas available.  The brands generally available in the supermarket pale by comparison.  The rich flavor is delightful;  Passion is by far my favorite.  What a delight to find it at Amazon by the case at a very good price and with free shipping - so easy and I didn't have to trek around to the one or two stores that carry Tazo hoping they have Passion in stock.

review/summary: Yeah it's strong, but that's a good thing
review/text: I like herbal tea in the evening.  It doesn't have to be a minty chamomile, just something tasty.  I like that with tea, I can control the strength and sweetness.<br /><br />I like to brew my tea in large mugs, but with most teas, that means two bags.  The fact I can brew about a pint with one bag makes this not only tasty, but economical compared to other evening favorites.<br /><br />Recently tried icing it, using two bags in about 12 ounces of water with three packets of Splenda, which was then poured into a 30 oz. tumbler full of ice cubes.  Delicious.<br /><br />I go to my local restaurant supply store (Cash & Carry) for my Tazo teas because their everyday price is better than the local supermarkets (and Amazon), but since tea is about the only thing I buy there, once I factor in gas and time, Amazon's free delivery makes their price competitive.

review/summary: Joy in a cup!
review/text: My niece Debbie, who works at Starbucks at Casino Windsor, introduced me to this and what a joy!  The flavor is very full bodied and layered--quite tart though (I don't sweeten), so be warned.  Not like anything else on the market that I've tasted before.  One of those teas you want to curl up with in your easy chair under a quilt, a good book in hand--ah!

review/summary: My absolute favorite tea
review/text: I LOVE this tea! It is by far my favorite of any other. Personally, i love the way it tastes all by itself. No honey or lemon needed. I haven't tried it iced because i am so hooked it on warm anyway!<br />I have been trying to drink more tea and was getting bored of the regualr green tea with lemon bit... So i picked up the assoprted Tazo tea pack and discovered this baby.<br />I pretty much ignored all the other flavors in the box!<br />This is a tea i could drink every day... If i didn't run out of it so quick!

review/summary: my favorite iced tea
review/text: This is my favorite iced tea.  I drink it at Starbucks always and now at home and from home constantly.<br /><br />I prefer to use the bigger iced tea bags.  The tea comes out fine but I need to use 10 bags for my size pitcher (which I then add cold water to - like Starbucks does) and it's a pain to open the 10 little tea envelopes.

review/summary: Fruity and healthy
review/text: With all the new research showing teas are better for you than water, I love having this slightly spicy/fruity herbal as an option in the afternoon.  I always try to drink some hibiscus tea a day because it has been shown to lower blood pressure and this is one of my favorites.<br /><br />It taste good warm, but even better cold.  There is no bitterness, because of balance between spicy and fruity flavors.

review/summary: TOO EXPENSIVE
review/text: Personally, I love this passion tea and drink a couple of cups a day so I go through a lot of tea. I started looking around to find a more affordable source of the tea and thought Amazon would be just the place. Not true!<br />I can get the same box of tea, 20 count, for under $4.00 a box where this is about $6.00 a box. Not a good deal!

review/summary: Not as Good as The Peaches/Pineapples but BPA Free
review/text: I buy the Native Forest peaches, pineapples, and these pears. The pears are probably my least favorite of the three (I rated the other two 5 stars here on amazon) but they're still pretty good. Not as flavor packed as the peaches and pineapples, but still enjoyable.<br /><br />BPA issue -- I emailed Edward and Son's (company that makes Native Forest brand) to find out about the BPA issue after reading a bunch of negative reviews about these cans being BPA lined. The answer is that some Native Forest cans are "cans specified to be BPA free" according to the Edward and Son's rep. The peaches, pineapples, and pears I bought were on the list I received in the email, so I continued to buy them with confidence. The asparagus and baby corn I bought were not on the list, so I stopped purchasing them.<br /><br />As I did with the peaches and pineapples reviews, I'll include the list of Native Forest brand BPA free cans I was given in the comments below. But overall, these are my least favorite of the 3 Native Forest canned fruits I buy, still pretty good though.

review/summary: They are good, but overpriced.
review/text: These were a little out of my price range but I got them anyway.  I will not be buying them again until I am much more prosperous!  They taste like pears, they're organic, and they will last a long time in storage.  I probably should say that I'm not too picky when it comes to fruit, as it's all good and sweet really.  They were certainly not soft pears, but I didn't mind at all.

review/summary: Dented cans, tinny taste
review/text: I bought a case of both the Native Forest Orgainc Asian Pears and their Peaches. As others have noted, nearly all the cans were significantly dented. The fruit had a tinny taste (not uncommon in canned vegetables, but less expected in organic produce.)  I do not intend to purchase again.

review/summary: Igredients list is not complete in this listing
review/text: Just received these and have not and will not taste them because they contain CITRIC ACID. For those who have a sensitivity to this ingredient it is important to know these contain it before you purchase it. Also that Citric Acid is made from Corn (possibly GMO, since these are from China) and Aspergillus Niger (A fermented fungus combo)and is basically a mold extract and certainly not derived from citrus.<br />The Peaches made by this same company however, do not have citric acid in them and are tasty and very sweet.

review/summary: Can they really be considered organic?
review/text: These are fairly tasty, but they are "organic" pears from CHINA and the cans are lined in BPA (a known endocrine disruptor). If you're familiar with organic certifications, you may have heard that China is well known for selling non-organic foods as organic. The Chinese have become masters at fooling certifying organizations. It is really hard to trust any certifications(organic, fair trade, etc.) from China so I don't trust these. Solana Gold and Columbia Gorge both sell organic canned pears grown in the USA and certified by Oregon Tilth. Amazon Fresh sells Solana Gold for $2.99 a can!

Yet I highly recommend this product and hope you enjoy it!
