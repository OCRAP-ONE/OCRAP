review/summary: Hide the box and it'll fool the kids
review/text: Kraft Mac and Cheese Veggie Pasta boasts a half serving of vegetables per serving of mac and cheese.  They accomplish this sneaky feat by incorporating cauliflower into the macaroni.  While I do have opinions on the long-term benefits of disguising vegetables into kids' food as opposed to feeding them actual vegetables, I will put my concerns aside in an effort to objectively review this product.  (Besides, mac and cheese is a highly processed food anyway, which leads to a whole other debate).<br /><br />Without comparing ingredient lists (which I prefer not to look at for this type of food), it appears that the characteristic cheese sauce pouch has been unaltered.  The orange, salty yet creamy taste that I loved as a child and as an adult is intact.  The only issue I had with the veggie version is the macaroni texture.  The traditional Kraft macaroni is forgiving as far as cooking times - I have overcooked and undercooked the macaroni over the years with acceptable results.  However, though I followed the cooking time guidelines and tasted the noodles frequently, the overall texture was somewhat mushy compared to the traditional recipe.<br /><br />In order to get a whole serving of vegetables, one would have to eat the whole box of mac and cheese (which is something I have certainly done).  Clearly this product is not satisfy the "Strive for 5 fruits and vegetables a day" criteria for healthy eating, but I suppose that it is better than nothing.  Because lets face it - Kraft Mac and Cheese is good, and people old and young are going to eat it anyway, so why not have half a serving of cauliflower at the same time?

review/text: Like Speghetti-o's offers a whole day's worth of veggies in each srving, so now does Kraft Cheese a Mac!<br /><br />There really isn't a distinct taste change in the product.  Still has that classic Kraft Mac & cheese!  So, if you are looking to get a veggie source into your kid's system, this is a great product to do it with!

review/summary: Just like the original!
review/text: Gone are the days when moms make kids sit at the dinner table until they finish their broccoli- companies are finding all sorts of crazy ways to sneak servings of vegetables into foods that kids love. I'm amazed it took this long for Kraft to jump on the bandwagon!<br /><br />In one cup of Kraft's Veggie Mac & Cheese, there's a half cup of veggies! How awesome is that?! Thanks to the Amazon Vine Program, I had the opportunity to taste the new Kraft Veggie Mac. I definitely couldn't tell the difference, and I've been eating original Kraft Mac & Cheese for a long time! My only hope is that they'll eventually make the shapes (e.g. Cars and Spongebob) with the veggie mac, because I prefer the shapes over the tube-like pasta (it's a consistency thing- no, I'm not that hung up on cartoons).<br /><br />Your kid will never know they're eating veggies while they eat their dinner- there's no difference in taste, color, or consistency! Kraft should start cranking this option out for Easy Mac too- then lots of college students would get more vegetables in their diet as well!

review/summary: Kraft Macaroni & Cheese
review/text: This was an item sent to me through the VINE program. The original offer stated 12 boxes, however when received there was only one box, thus my review is limited to one serving of the macaroni. According to the box this is a VEGGIE PASTA with "1/2 serving of vegeatbles". The word used  in "vegetables". However the ingredients on the box indicates there is only cauliflower in the pasta. I have reviewed every speck of writing on the box and do not find any other vegetable being used.  On the back side of the box is written, "there are veggies in here. lots of other vegetables come right at you with their overt vegetableness". (By the way, this is a word I am unable to locate in the dictionary.) I am under the impression that the total ingredients should be listed on the box and apparently they are not. Now for the taste test. This is limited to one serving and I frankly could not tell any difference in the macaroni and cheese. Thus we took one of the regular boxes from our pantry and cooked it to see if we could tell the difference and once again we do not see any difference between the two.If one is to expect a significance difference between the two, it did not come across to us.

review/summary: Mac & Cheese
review/text: What can I say - it tastes like pre packaged mac & cheese in a box. No better, no worse. The selling point of this is that it is a way to get your little ones to have more veggies in their diet. If they like packaged mac & cheese, they will never know that you snuck a portion of veggies into their meal. As far as buying it because it's sooooo good, this isn't the holy grail. All in all it's as good as any other name brand m&c on the market but made with veggies for (hopefully) a higher nutritional value, which is surely a positive in a product not generally known for it's healthfulness.

review/text: I just made this mac & cheese and all I can say is.....seriously?? Veggie pasta?? No way!! My daughter and I ate this and we couldn't tell the difference between this one and the regular one. I keep several boxes of the "regular" one in the pantry. My daughter likes it as a snack after school and our grandson always asks Mimi to fix it for him! If this "veggie" pasta mac & cheese comes to my store shelf, I will definitely buy it! Why not slip some veggies in when and where you can!! I really was expecting it to have a different taste so I was very pleased when I tasted it. Go ahead, try some. You won't know the difference and you certainly won't be able to taste the veggies!!

review/summary: Surprisingly just fine!
review/text: We switched a long time ago to only eating 100% whole grain pasta, so we haven't eaten Kraft in a long time, but I was intrigued by the veggie claim, 1/2 serving of veggies.  Now, I could not find on the box if that was per serving or if that was per box.  The pasta gets veggie serving from cauliflower, and it was just fine tasting, no one would ever know.  The cheese was of course lust like any other Kraft mac n cheese.  So, if you are just looking for a way to sneak in more veggies into your diet, then switch from your regular mac n cheese to this, you'll never know the difference.  I will add that the pasta is best when cooked for the shorter recommended cooking time.

review/summary: BLAND
review/text: I am generally a fan of mac and cheese, though I typically go for the sharp cheddar variety.  I don't have a big problem eating my veggies, but if I can get a little extra in while enjoying some mac and cheese I figured it might be worth it.  Oh my goodness, but this was the most bland dish I have tasted in quite some time!  The noodles seemed a little more soft than those to which I am accustomed, and there was just no real taste at all to the sauce.  After a couple of bites, I spent some quality time in front of my spice rack and finally came away with something I was willing to eat.<br /><br />So if you are on a soft, bland diet and you need to get in more veggies then I guess I could recommend this.  But if you are able just stick with your usual mac and cheese and add a salad.  You will get more veggies and your taste buds will thank you.

review/summary: A Good Alternative
review/text: The Kraft Veggie Pasta variety of Macaroni and Cheese is virtually indistinguishable, I thought, from their regular version. If you're a big fan of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, or if your kids are, you can buy the Veggie version, and still have the same Macaroni and Cheese that you love. I'm a big fan of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, and I found this to be delicious.<br /><br />Is it actually "healthier?" I'm undecided on that. The main "veggie" ingredient is powdered cauliflower, and that ingredient is fairly low on the list of ingredients, so, I have to wonder how much "veggie" you're actually getting. Still, some "veggie" is better than none, I suppose. And if this is virtually all your kid eats (and I know some kids like that), at least you can feel confident that you're giving them a slightly more healthy alternative.

review/text: I'm good at making mac & cheese.  But this?  I could tell it would be a sub-par meal while the pasta was still in the pot.  It's just... OFF.  It smelled odd, tasted odd, even after a couple of my usual enhancers- honey-mustard sauce on part, real bacon bits in another.  I finished, but mostly because I don't waste food.  I won't be buying this again.<br /><br />Maybe if your kid has a cold and can't smell and taste things very well, they might tolerate it.

It does have a 1/2 serving of vegitables per cup which, is not really a lot when you think about it, but not much other nutritional value. If your kids won't eat any veggies, then this is probobly a good product for you.  I think I will stick to the other brank I like and add some chopped up veggies instead.

review/text: As a mom, I am always looking for a way to increase nutritional value of the meals I serve. The Vegi Kraft Macaroni and Cheese tastes just like the original, and looks just like the original product, so it was a simple switch. My kids didn't notice any difference, nor did I enlighten them until the meal was complete. They were surprised to learn the mac and cheese was Vegi, and not the normal blue box I have been serving for years.<br /><br />Beware, though, of the size difference.Instead of the normal 7.25 oz, this product is 5.5 oz, which increases cost per serving. All in all, a successful product!<br /><br />**EDITED TO ADD: 11/13/11 - Since posting this review, Kraft Veggie Pasta Mac and Cheese has become a staple in our home. We are really enjoying this delicious product!

review/summary: Not as Much Extra Nutrition as It Touts - But it Tastes the Same
review/text: If I had to choose between the Original Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, and this new Vegi Original, I would have to stick with the good old Original Blue Box.  The veggie version of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese tastes pretty much the same, includes a few minor additions to nutrition, including 15% Vitamin C, an additional 5% in iron, and 2g more dietary fiber...but is this worth the missing 2 oz of cheesy goodness and the higher price tag?  Not really, in my opinion.  When reading the ingredients, it seems like the big addition is cauliflower (which is actually fairly low in the ingredients list).<br /><br />If you're really itching to add more veggie in your kid's diet without them knowing, this is an okay start.  Otherwise, it's not really a significant enough difference to adding veggies in your kids' diet.  I give this 3 stars for tasting relatively the same, but subtract 2 knowing that it's really all a gimmick.

review/summary: Not convinced
review/text: There are now several varieties in the popular Kraft Macaroni and Cheese line.  This is a relatively expensive (per ounce) variety.  The selling point is that it is a healthy option, as the pasta incorporates reconstituted cauliflower.  Like the other varieties, it produces a tasty snack.<br /><br />Macaroni and Cheese (or just 'Macaroni Cheese', as the British say) is actually very easy to make.  You just boil the macaroni until it is soft and there is little water remaining, then add grated cheese, margarine or butter, and a little milk.  Stir it until the mixture has melted and is coating the pasta, and serve.  Black pepper tops it off nicely.  Using these packets is only slightly more convenient and a lot more expensive, plus you are getting heavily processed ingredients.  I'm not convinced that including some dried cauliflower in the pasta really makes it a healthy option.<br /><br />Actually, cauliflower goes very well with Macaroni and Cheese.  Try adding a few florets into the macaroni when you boil it.  Then, whether you add your own sauce ingredients or use these packaged versions, you really will be getting a tastier, more nutritious meal.

review/summary: Tastes the same as regular Kraft.  Be aware of smaller size though.
review/text: This Kraft Mac and Cheese is trying to stand out in the marketplace by using cauliflower pasta.  Don't worry if you dislike cauliflower- this tastes the same as standard Mac and Cheese pasta.  You do cook it for a minute less than the regular product.<br /><br />While you may be interested in buying this in order to get the vegetable serving, keep in mind you are paying about the same price for a smaller box (5.5 oz vs 7.25 oz).  The silver lining in this is that the calories in an entire prepared box are much lower in this veggie version (750 vs 1200 calories).<br /><br />This product may be useful for sneaking veggies into a kid's diet.  But the veggie amount is low, so you are better off adding fresh vegetables to a regular box of Kraft Mac and Cheese.

review/summary: Slightly weird taste, minor nutritional improvment
review/text: The veggie involved here is dried cauliflower replacing some of the wheat starch in the noodles.  It smells like cauliflower when boiling.  It has a very mild cauliflower taste.<br /><br />In exchange for a slightly unusual taste, the "veggie" version of Kraft gives you:<br />Vitamin C 15% daily value (vs. 1% in the regular version)<br />Dietary Fiber 3 grams (vs. 1.5 in the regular stuff)<br /><br />Those were the only notable differences.  An extra 1.5 grams of fiber doesn't seem like a lot, but that's 12% DV instead of 6%.  For other nutrients, such differences matter a lot less.  The veggie version has 1 gram less fat, but that's only 11 calories worth of fat shaved from a food which is already fairly low in fat, and the total calories end up being the same anyway.  There are some 1% differences in some other vitamins, which doesn't matter.<br /><br />Getting back to the taste...<br />Even though there is only a small cauliflower influence on the taste, I found that it somehow did detract from enjoyment.  Blue-box Mac&Cheese has a very mild cheese flavor, which works OK when the noodles are normal.  But the very slight added cauliflower taste kind of masks the cheese.<br /><br />If you have kids demanding it 3 times per week, a little extra fiber and vitamin C might be a good idea.  But if this is your guilty pleasure food or just a backup plan for rare occasions, I would stick with the normal stuff.<br /><br />If you want to experiment with healthier noodles, there are several brands of dry pasta with omega 3 fats and added fiber.  They do tend to have a wheaty flavor, but on the other hand they don't have that weird cauliflower taste.

review/summary: A thinly-veiled gimmick
review/text: This "veggie" pasta purports to sneak in a serving of vegetables and as well have less fat and calories than the original Mac 'n Cheese. It's easy to have less when you change from a 7.5 ounce to a 5.5 ounce portion, which I first noticed when I poured the pasta into the water. It's a lot less than a normal box, even though the box is roughly the same size.<br /><br />After cooking, the pasta smells vaguely of cauliflower, the vegetable that makes it "veggie". Of any vegetable to choose, why that one? What nutritional advantage does it have in its processed forms? Even then, does it really matter what you choose when the chief ingredients are butter, milk, and cheese?<br /><br />The taste is fine, but nothing special. It's not quite the original.

review/summary: What's not to like about Kraft Mac and Cheese?
review/text: Ok, I will admit that when I saw Vegi -- I expected more than ONE Veggie to be in the mix-- it turns out that the pasta is made with Cauliflower. I was a bit hesitant, but fired up the stove, set the pot a-boiling and made the pasta -- the kitchen smelled mildly and pleasantly like Cauliflower. ADd the cheese, milk (in my case unsweetend Soy Milk) butter (in my case olive oil), mixed everyhing as per instructions,and -- well..<br /><br />I suppose this serves two or three people, but I ate the WHOLE pot in two closely spaced sittings. Ummm! It was creamy and WONDERFUL!! The cauliflower gave the pasta a tangy-sweet taste. On the second sitting (which took place about 5 minutes after the first sitting) I added Little Baby Peas to the mix, because I LOVE to add Little Baby Peas to my Mac and Cheese -- and then I scarfed it all up.<br /><br />This is a wonderful new product -- I would also suggest that Kraft consider another version, using carrots -- orange Mac and Cheese with Orange cheese -- and even -- Spinach maybe!<br /><br />I will buy this product again - it is really a great new twist on Kraft's "usual" (which I also love) Mac and Cheese.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised!
review/text: My son absolutely loves Kraft's Macaroni and Cheese but, like a lot of moms, I have mixed feelings about feeding it to him. For one thing, that day-glo orange color scares me... and yet that's one of the things he loves best about it. I've tried other mac & cheese products -- and making it from scratch -- but if it's not that vivid orange, he's just not as happy! Two of my other reservations involve the sodium level, and the stuff's ultimate nutritional void.<br /><br />So, enter Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Vegi Original. Using cauliflower in both the pasta and the sauce, Kraft has managed to accomplish the very same thing I'd been doing (sneaking in veggies), so I do feel better about this version. The bright orange color is there, so my son was happy, too. I hadn't told him I was trying anything new, but judging by the way he wolfed down his meal this tastes the exact same. Of course, that still leaves my sodium concern, and with 28% of the daily allowance in a prepared single serving, there's still quite a bit of salt in here.<br /><br />That said, my husband -- who does NOT like mac & cheese OR cauliflower -- also polished off his plate. In 14 years of marriage, I've never seen him do that. So whatever Kraft's up to, it's good and I'm glad not to have to make two separate dinners anymore!<br /><br />To sum up:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1. A good dose of cauliflower in both the pasta and sauce.<br />2. Same easy to follow instructions as the regular stuff.<br />3. No noticeable change in taste or texture, despite the cauliflower addition.<br />4. One less vegetable serving I have to sneak into a meal.<br />5. Same neon orange color as your kids are used to.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. Still using 'enriched' flour rather than whole grain.<br />2. Still pretty high in sodium (28% daily allowance per serving).<br />3. Still that same neon orange color your kids are used to.

review/text: Leave it to a company like Kraft to come up with a great idea on how to increase the vegetable intake of both children and adults around the world while enjoying the same great tasting American staple. After tasting this new Cheese Vegi Original product, I can honestly say that I cannot tell the difference between these noodles and the original noodles that aren't mixed with vegetables. Sure, kids probably shouldn't be eating a ton of mac'n'cheese in the first place, but I think Kraft is due a pat on the back for making an effort to increase the nutritional value of their already delicious product.

review/summary: Hidden veggies not a bad idea, but not going to get you out of eating vegetables!
review/text: I am someone who mixes pureed cauliflower into my garlic mashed potatoes so I was excited to try this new Veggie Pasta & Cheese from Kraft.  The box is 5.5 ounces so slightly smaller than the regular kind, but the serving size is the same per ounce as the original (70 grams),although the box says there are only two servings in the this box.  I am not sure how many servings are in a regular box.  The stats are pretty much the same as regular except for this has 05.g less saturated fat and 2 grams  more in fiber.<br /><br />In each 1 cup serving there is 1/4 cup worth of veggies (in the form of powdered cauliflower.)  One serving of veggies is 1/2 cup so this will definitely not replace all of your, or your child's, veggie requirements for the day.  You would have to eat the whole box yourself to get just ONE serving of vegetables!  There are lower calorie was to get a serving of veggies!!<br /><br />Now, what you REALLY want to know is does it TASTE good?  Well, yes it does!  It actually tastes no different from the regular.  My son was none the wiser to his regular box being replaced with this Veggie version.  While you are cooking it, you can smell the cauliflower but it is not terribly bad.  Once you mix the cheese packet, butter and milk you can't smell it anymore.<br /><br />So do I recommend it?  Yes.  1/2 serving of veggies is better than none, and since the taste seems virtually the same how can you go wrong.

review/text: This veggie version of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Dinner made with cauliflower noodles tastes EXACTLY like the old favorite.  Each cup provides one-half serving of vegetables.<br /><br />The nutritional values are almost the same as the original dinner with  slightly more iron, Vitamin C, and a little less cholesterol.<br /><br />That good old, tangy cheese flavor I've loved since childhood is still there and no one will know it's got a vegetable in it.  Delicious!

review/summary: Very Very Cheesey
review/text: If you're looking for a different take on the classic Kraft mac n cheese you'll probably love this. For me it was a little too much cheese so the 2nd box I backed it off a bit - but that's probably just me I like the taste of pasta and cheese not just cheese with some chunks of noodle as a garnish.

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: I got this macaroni and cheese for my husband, since I can't stand the stuff. He says it's not bad. It was easy to prepare, took about ten minutes to cook, including boiling the water. He says you can't taste a difference between this stuff and the regular kind, despite the claims of vegetable servings in it. It did smell like vegetables when it was cooking, not in a bad way, but you really can't taste it at all.<br /><br />Overall, my husband gives this product four out of five stars. It tastes good, is fairly easy to make, and contains invisible vegetables. Perfect for kids (or hubbies!) who won't eat their veggies!

review/summary: smart menu choice
review/text: If you remember the old commercial where a restaurant switches Folgers for their regular brew and no-one realizes; now we can switch the old mac and cheese out for a new improved extra veggie version. The reason why?....the kids didn't notice. Simple as that - we live in a household where the grown-ups have a sophisticated palate whereas the children prefer more 'junkfood' fare. Whole wheat spaghetti and ground turkey rather than beef notwithstanding, this latest addition to the healthy choice for kids crusade (Thanks Michele Obama!) is a winner simply because it does not stand out. Congratulations Kraft!

review/summary: My kids couldn't tell the difference
review/text: I told my kids we were trying "new" mac & cheese that was healthier for them. I asked them to tell me what they thought and to be honest. Both of my kids said they could NOT tell the difference between the veggie mac and "regular" mac and cheese. Even my brother (who loves Kraft Mac & Cheese and was VERY leary of trying *veggie* pasta) liked it. Myself, I'm not a big mac & cheese eater but it tasted the same to me as the regular stuff. Luckily I'm not a mom who has to sneak veggies into the diet of my kids (they like veggies) but I'm always looking for ways to make boxed food (which I very rarely use), more healthy. Thanks Kraft

review/summary: Mac and cheese vegi original
review/text: Really, you can not taste the difference between this and the regular Kraft mac and cheese. I had my husband and kids (ages 15, 11 and 9) try this and they couldn't tell the difference either. The noodles are made from cauliflower and so I was expecting it to taste a bit like cauliflower with cheese sauce. Nope. You can't tell. This would be a good and sneaky way to add more veg and fiber into yours or your kids diet.

review/summary: Mac an' cheese = mac an' cheeese
review/text: Well mac and cheese, basically is just that.  A fun filled load of "filling" "pasta and chemicals that our kids loved and now our granddaughter also loves it.  The veggie pasta is a little lighter in texture than the traditional macaroni, and taste the same.  However, the cheese sauce has a strong sugary, almost honey-like undertone that takes away from any 'cheesy' taste - which is minimal.  I recognize this is for kids..  Let them have it.

review/text: My kids get mac n cheese every once in awhile with dinner and I loved the idea of a 'healthier' version without making it from scratch myself.  It's just nice to have an easy meal once in awhile.  I could tell it smelled slightly different while cooking as well as the taste was just a little different than the normal kraft mac n cheese.  However, my kids weren't fazed and ate their normal amount.  I'd buy this again if the price was comparable to the regular flavor.  Otherwise, I'd just add my own veggies to it.

review/text: So it's made out of cauliflower rather than white flour and while it should be healthier................it's macaroni and cheese.  It is not what I would consider to be a healthy food.  The kids liked it and they couldn't tell the difference from the original.  So short of the packaging and the claims I think this is a good product and tastes fairly similar to the original.

review/summary: Tastes great to me!
review/text: Kraft Mac and Cheese has always been my go-to quick mac and cheese. Though there may be some subtle taste difference between this and the regular, I can't taste it and neither could my husband. There is only 1/2 serving of veggies per cup, but getting an extra half serving of veggies in your mac and cheese isn't such a bad deal, really (and if you mix in some peas or green beans, then you've got yourself a bit of a meal). (I think the real question here is if we should wonder if the federal regulations for saying something has a serving of vegetables/fruit have become too lax lately.)<br /><br />I'd definitely buy it again. I'm currently pregnant, so any place I can sneak in an extra vegetable serving (especially since so many normal foods don't appeal to me now) is good. And while I don't think this is the way to get your kids to eat their veggies, again it's not a bad way to get some extra in there.

review/text: This product compares perfectly with traditional Kraft macaroni and cheese in a box with cheese dust that reconstitutes with liquid.  For that product, it is okay--Kraft has always made the best version.  However, it certainly does not taste as good as the Kraft pasta products that use cheese sauce packed in a foil pouch.

review/text: If you (or your kids or grandkids) like the taste of the REGULAR mac-n-cheese, then they will probably like this one too.  My kids didn't even notice a difference.  It looked and tasted the same as the regular mac-n-cheese.  If, however, you or your kids are not a fan of Kraft Mac-n-Cheese, then you aren't going to like this one either because it is essentially the same.

review/summary: Kid likes it.
review/text: Macaroni and cheese will probably never be a "health food", but it doesn't hurt to compromise and serve it up as a side or even as an entr&eacute;e sometimes.  But if you can make it a little more nutritionally balanced and still get the kids to eat it that would be good right?<br /><br />That's where this product comes in.  It is basically Kraft Macaroni and Cheese with "enriched cauliflower pasta product".  So is it "more nutritious" than regular mac & cheese?  And will the kids eat it?<br /><br />Nutritionally I'll compare this product to Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Whole Grain original flavor.<br /><br />  WG VP<br />Total Fat 3.5g 3.5g<br />Cholesterol 15mg 10mg<br />Fiber  5g 3g<br />Protein  8g 10g<br />Vitamin A 15% 15%<br />Vitamin C 0% 15%<br />Calcium  15% 15%<br />Iron  10% 15%<br /><br />As you can see, total fat is the same for the new product but cholesterol is 33% lower.  Fiber is also lower, but that's no doubt due to the fact that I'm using Whole Grain as a baseline.  VP isn't relatively low, WG is relatively high.  We can also see that Vitamin C goes from 0 to 15%, and iron is increased by 50% relative to Whole Grain.<br /><br />As for taste, reviewers agreed that it was "as good as" Whole Wheat.  Importantly, my incredibly picky 8-year-old boy who loves mac & cheese said that he would eat it again, even after I told him what was in it.<br /><br />In summary, the product offers some attractive nutritional benefits and my kids will eat it.  That's a win-win and we'll be buying more.

review/text: I really like Kraft Mac & Cheese - have since I was a kid. It's a comfort food and no, I don't care about carb counting etc when I'm craving mac & cheese. I like this "vegi" version of Kraft Mac & Cheese. It tastes like the original, apparently the only difference is the noodles - the cheese flavor packet is the same. One difference I did notice is that the noodles seem to cook a couple of minutes faster than the original, though that could also be the result of some new cooking pots. I would buy this version if the original was out of stock at our local grocery store - though I don't see any reason to pay extra for the "vegi" labeling.

review/summary: CAULIFLOWER PASTA!?
review/text: As the pasta cooked, I read the box to see what makes this "smmmile, it's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R8L71W">veggie pasta & cheese</a>."  Cauliflower pasta? I'd never heard of such a thing. What a good idea!  (The dinner, on the whole, has two grams fewer of carbohydrates, at 47g carbohydrate, 7g sugar. I was hoping that this would be a good alternative for a diabetic friend, but it won't be.)<br /><br />My only deviation from the recipe on the box was using 1% milk.  I didn't doctor it with extra ingredients or by adding vegetables, because I wanted to taste what it tasted like on its own.<br /><br />It tasted like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, the stuff that my mom occasionally fed us when we were kids.  The pasta was soft but not mushy. The cheese concoction tastes the same as the standard.<br /><br />Not as good as my friend Meem's homemade - it's not even the same category - but DEFINITELY better than adequate as a comfort food from one's childhood.<br /><br />The other member of my household agreed on all points, including, since "sneaking" vegetables in our household was never an issue, that this would taste even yummier with fresh broccoli or cauliflower in it.<br /><br />More Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, please?

review/summary: Mac and cheese is as mac and cheese does
review/text: The purpose of this product appears to be to convince parents that the only way to get children to eat vegetables is to disguise them as macaroni. Hence the noodly portion of this product is 50 percent cauliflower. Whether there are actual health benefits to ingesting heavily processed cauliflower as versus heavily processed wheat, in combination with heavily processed cheese-like topping, is not mine to say. (Kids I know who are exposed early and often to real vegetables seem to like them in their unprocessed state, and I'm sure that fresh veggies from a local farm are FAR healthier than any variant of laboratory rat food.)<br /><br />But that said, there is room in the world for mac and cheese, and this product tastes like mac and cheese. There is a slight cauliflower aroma during the boiling of pasta phase, but the cheese-like topping combined with butter and milk completely eliminates any possible confusion with actual cauliflower.<br /><br />As an employee of mine once observed, "It's better than runnin' a nail in your foot."

review/summary: Tastes great, and a better choice than regular white pasta
review/text: While the first ingredient of this product is enriched wheat flour, cauliflower is not far behind. I myself have used pureed cauliflower as a "stealth ingredient" in meals, such as in mashed potatoes, a-la Jessica Seinfeld's cookbook.  It's a great add-in, as it provides quality nutrients and fiber with minimal changes in taste.  I have found though, that if you add too much of this vegetable, it does become noticeable.  And while I don't mind this myself, my kids notice and don't care for it.<br /><br />So I was very excited when I discovered this product.  And when I made it as part of our dinner tonight, I was eager to see how it turned out.  Would it be worthy of the Kraft Blue Box?<br /><br />While straining the pasta after cooking, I could detect the scent of cauliflower, but it wasn't intense.  The product cooked up the same as usual with no sign of any difference.<br /><br />The taste was just fine.  My husband and I noticed a slight difference in taste, but we liked it.  My six-year old made no comment whatsoever, and we didn't tell him about the new ingredients.<br /><br />The current price on Amazon puts this product at about $1.66 per box before shipping.  I usually pay less than a dollar for generic mac-n-cheese, but I've been buying it less and less in recent years because of the less healthy white pasta.  So while this product is a bit more expensive, I love the cauliflower feature.  I'll probably keep an eye out for online promotions or grocery store coupons, but I'd love to buy it in the future.

review/summary: Kids like it better but overall comparsion to regular is a bust
review/text: Before preparing this, I compared the nutrition labels of the Kraft Veggie (made from Cauliflower based pasta) to a box of original mac & cheese.  Except for a higher percentage of iron and the inclusion of vitamin C, the veggie pasta wasn't significantly different than the original version.  It also had more fat, cholesterol and I believe calories than the oritingal version. The cheese powder seems to be the exact same in both...which is really where the health improvements probably need to be made.  So, if you're choosing this over the original because it's "healthier", you may want to think again.<br /><br />If you're buying it due to an allergy issue...then this might be a better choice.<br /><br />My kids did prefer the taste of the veggie pasta over the original version.  They will eat both though so I predict future purchases will be based on which version is less expensive between these two and the whole wheat variety.  I already know my kids get enough vitamin C and iron each day.<br /><br />I'm giving it four stars because they liked the taste.<br />I'm not giving it a fifth star because the inclusion of "veggie" on the label leads others to believe it's healthier than it really is.

review/summary: Disappointment
review/text: This was a disappointing "macaroni and cheese" product.  Sure, it sneaks in some nutritional value, but face it--you can add regular veggies like broccoli or cauliflower to regular macaroni and cheese with far more cheese flavor.  This didn't deliver Kraft's signature cheesy flavor or a significant amount of vegetables to the diet.<br /><br />My recommendation is to just stick to the regular mac & cheese products and have your veggies with it--it's going to be a lot better for you.  This wasn't a great dish, and far from a successful one.<br /><br />Economically speaking, it has fewer servings in the box to deliver that half serving of vegetables, and by the time that half serving is shrunk even further by eating less of the entire box...there's not enough vegetables to matter.

Enter Golden Valley Natural: This stuff tastes better than I remember. The texture is just as I remember, the flavor is BETTER and it's just as thin. No sweet tasting jerky here, just great flavor that isn't too overwhelming and just perfect for a snack. This is coming from a person who is: 1) Super particular 2) Not easily impressed 3) Looking for this stuff for close to 10 years (so it better be as good if not better).

At least some of the proceeds support The Prince of Wale's Charitable Foundation. I ate these cookie/biscuits plain; the package suggests that being both savory and sweet they would also be good with cheese.<br /><br />I used Amazon's Add-on program when I made my order.

No, not at all, you must try this for yourself!<br /><br />These little tomatoes are best used as a simple (simple!) companion for outstanding pasta (for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M5DBJW">Bucatini By Pastificio Faella From Gragnano</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002CTP5M">Maccheroni by Martelli, Toscana</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00362E4HO">Latini Spaghetti Chitarra 1.1lb</a>) by just sweating 2 or 3 cloves of fresh garlic in evo oil, than adding these tomatoes with a pinch of salt on MILD heat and gently heat them up, then add to prepared pasta. You can add a good pesto or fresh basil to taste, if you like. The experience will be otherwordly!<br /><br />I had tried them first in 2009, that is how I know the price difference. At that time the small jar (520g) was 22.50$, and I found that a bit steap. But now they offer 2 sizes, and now you get a kilo (1000g) for 25.50, respective the small jar for 14.00$. Now I have tested the product again, because I was suspicious about that. Would that be a lesser quality, now with the lower price? No, not at all, it is really the same great item. Maybe the higher price had to with a lesser harvest back then? I have no idea, but I love love love these tomatoes.<br /><br />I have seen videos on youtube about fancy restaurants in New York City putting them on their fancy pizza. I can't travel there, but I can get the ingredients delivered to my kitchen!

Of course I used butter, not margarine, which no doubt enhanced the flavor.

review/summary: Decent sardines
review/text: This is the "cheap" version of the Crown Prince sardines, renamed "Ocean Prince".  Shipping arrived without any issues, no damage to the cans. Cans are kinda hard to open, compared to some other brands.  I immediately noticed that the oil tasted inferior to the olive oil used in their premium versions (this version uses soybean oil).  The sardines were acceptable quality, certainly not on par with their premium line, but certainly not bad.  The tasteless oil didnt help.  Sardines were packed in tight.  I would give the Sardines 3 Stars, if not for the fact that you get a great deal: 24 cans!  So 4 stars..barely.  I would've paid a little more to get better quality sardines in better oil.

review/summary: Five-Stars Quality, One Star Value.
review/text: UPDATED 5/28/12:<br />I see the price of these has gone up more than 50%, although I believe the earlier price was in error, so I will not be buying these in the future. It seems that buying 24 cans in warehouse packaging should be a better deal than this is offering to us. In addition my last two shipments were a bit less fish and more oil than the first ones. For those reasons I have dropped my earlier rating of 5 to 3 stars.<br /><br />Incidentally, I never received a response from the company as to why the front of the can says 120gm and the box says 95gm.<br />========================<br /><br />In the words of that wonderful Tina Turner classic- "Simply the Best."<br /><br />These are excellent in almost every way. Only the can itself could be improved.  I will admit that the container can be quite a challenge.  While it pops open easily, peeling the top gets progressively more difficult as you proceed.  It is nearly impossible to remove the lid entirely- and truly impossible to do so without ejecting  a bit of the oil from the can.  According to the packaging and can imprints, the sardines are caught wild and canned in Morocco. I think the containers might be made from abandoned WW II German tanks.<br /><br />That said, it is well worth the struggle.  Every can of the original 24 was fully packed with 4 fairly large, tan in color sardines: skinless (there were perhaps three sardines in the 24  cans with the slightest trace of skin remaining) and absolutely no bone. The taste and texture are excellent.  I have never had any particular thrill from olive oil, so the fact that these are in soy oil (and filled to the brim) was no problem for me to say the least.  Lightly salted (for sardines). You will almost surely be consuming 100% of the can content.<br /><br />This might not be the first choice of the top-tier of gourmet consumers (I am not one), but I can not imagine any sardine lover, nor many non-lovers, not being extremely pleased with this product.<br /><br />This is truly a 5-star selection.<br /><br />Note that while the front of the box says: "Net Wt. 4.25 OZ (120g)"<br />the Nutrition Facts on the back of the box show it as 95g  which is 3.35 OZ<br />===================<br />From the packaging:<br />Serving size 1 can (95g) Servings per container 1<br />Amount per serving: (% = % Daily Value)<br />Calories 220 Calories from Fat 130<br />Total Fat 14g (21%)<br /> Saturated Fat 3g (17%)<br /> Trans Fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 35mg (12%)<br />Sodium 360mg (15%)<br />Total Carbohydrate 0g<br />Protein 24g (48%)<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 6%<br />Iron 10%<br />Contains 2g of Omega-3 Fatty Acids per serving<br />Ingredients: Sardines, Soy Bean Oil, Salt<br />==================

And there they were and cheaper than I had been paying all those years.  Thank you Amazon!!  I bought a case right away since we eat these all the time for snacks or light lunches.  Great product.  Can't go wrong with boneless and skinless.  Excellent on a Townhouse cracker.

review/text: The product itself is awesome. I had been eating a can everyday, Sun-Fri for over three years (a case has 24, so 4week x 6days).<br /><br />I started the subscription to Amazon Jan of 2011 in order to save money. The price had always been 24.50, except July 12, 2011 where it was only 23.15.<br /><br />In May 2012 I went on Amazon to see when my next shipment was scheduled to ship. At that time it was still 24.50. Less than 7 days later I went on Amazon to get an early shipment and to my shock the price had almost doubled!!!<br /><br />I can understand the price going up a couple cents, even a couple dollars - but going up 15.28 overnight, for a 24.50 item, is insane!<br /><br />Needless to say, I haven't ordered any since!

review/text: I spent the first 10 years of my life on an island, where seafood is a staple, so I am a big sardine lover. I really love these, especially at the price and free shipping. I have eaten the boneless & skinless by Crown Prince and Season in olive oil, which I have at home now while I wait for these to become available, and I really can't tell that much of a difference in quality and taste. Of course, I always drain the oil before I make my sandwich, so that might make a difference, but all I taste is the great flavour and texture of sardines. They are tightly packed (you really get your money's worth), easy to open (in my opinion), and I would choose these over what some people consider "premium" sardines any day.

The frosting was very difficult to spread, even after warming the spatula.  I eventually had to keep adding more hot water.  Toppings (chocolate shavings, sprinkles) had to be forcefully pressed into the frosting.  I would definitely make the cupcakes again, but would use my own frosting.  All-in-all, if you're not worried about presentation, whip these up...so delish!

review/summary: Worst boxed cake mix EVER
review/text: I went on the internet to see if the white chocolate cupcake mix with raspberry frosting by Dean Jacobs had been recalled because it reeked when I opened the package of cake mix.  The suggested sites based on my search lead me to check out reviews on Amazon.  Thinking that the smell might somehow improve after baking the cupcakes, I proceeded to mix and bake them according to the directions.  The odor is a whiskey or other alcohol odor and they taste like a concoction of chemicals.  I will stick with doctoring up a Duncan Hines cake mix in the future.  DO NOT waste your money on this product!  It actually deserves NO stars.

Now days lot's of tea companies add "flavoring" to tea to make it fruity or nutty or what have you, this one is PURE! It's kind of pricey, but work every penny.<br /><br />You can find this tea in many local European and Russian deli stores, and usually goes for around $6-8 for 250 grams. But be careful there seems to be a look a like tea with similar name and label, it comes in a "soft" paper package, while this one comes in "hard" cardboard like package. The two teas are completely different and the other one does add flavoring to it, I'm not saying it's bad, just different.

review/text: I am slightly confused by the two previous reviews of this tea, which state that it is not flavoured.  I was introduced to this tea by two friends from St. Petersburg who gave me an open box during the course of a visit.  This is not simply a black tea, it is a spiced tea similar to Earl Grey.  The paradox is that I am nto an Earl Grey lover - my tea preferences tend more towards Assam or Lapsang Souchong.  However for me this rea gets that extra taste just right.  It's very pricy for me to order this for delivery to the UK, but I do that, so take that as a concrete indication of my appreciation.  If you like Earl Grey, try this.

This is an excellent mix that can be made into a one-dish meal by adding 2 or 3 pouches of mix and the recommended amount of water to a pound of cooked ground beef and a can of tomatoes.  Then the leftovers can be stuffed into bell peppers for stewed peppers another night.

review/summary: NOT AN ASSORTMENT - Buyer beware!
review/text: I purchased this item for party favors for my twins 5 year old birthday party.  I was seriously disappointed with the contents, as I expected a Pixar assortment since that is what the title states.<br /><br />Here is what I received<br /><br />4 Captain Jack Sparrow<br />2 Davy Jones<br />3 Mike (from Monsters, Inc)<br />1 Bruce the shark from Finding Nemo<br />2 Iridessa (one of the Tinkerbelle fairies)<br /><br />What a terrible assortment!  Only 4 out of 12 are actually Pixar, as advertised.  Half are Pirates of the Carribean (which is not Pixar!)  Way too many duplicates and minor characters!  Guess I will be headed to the store today to buy some Pez dispensers, as not many appropriate selections for girls. Buyer beware!!

review/summary: Mmmm. Delicious Sprees
review/text: Sprees were my favorite childhood candy and it's very rare that I can find them anywhere in public. So I went nuts and ordered a box and ate two rolls. They're not the cheap Sprees that I've had before that didn't have the hard shell but the ones that are really hard candy.<br /><br />Needless to say that the temptation is too great to entire the entire box and I'll probably require dental work to repair the damage the yummy goodness has done to my teeth. But it'll be worth it.

review/summary: Great Candy!
review/text: These are great candies. However, they vary depending on where they are made. The ones manufactured in the USA (I don't know if they still are) are different from those made in Mexico (which I think Amazon sells).<br /><br />The USA product is made with the ingredients listed in the product description. These are quite hard.<br /><br />The "Product of Mexico" version does not include sugar as a *listed* ingredient and these tend to be more "crumbly" than the USA version with sugar listed in the ingredients.<br /><br />Still love these - regardless of where they are manufactured!

review/summary: Oatmeal Raisin Cookies of Joy
review/text: Frankly, I don't care if food is organic, or non-organic, or natural, or whatever. I like food that tastes good. And while I recognize that cookies aren't really "food", in the sense that they're a desert -- and certainly not something you turn to if you're looking for your basic nutrition, I find these particular cookies to be totally AWESOME. I like my oatmeal raisin cookies soft, and that's what these are. Soft, sweet, chewy, superb. I wouldn't mind if they were a smidgeon cheaper, but I would imagine making them organic adds to the cost -- so I blame you danged hippies with your granola-crunchy desire for kumbaya soul harmony when it comes to the sticker shock. Still, they're good enough they're worth it. They'll probably negatively impact my waistline, but as I'm not a believer in reincarnation, I figure I got one shot at existence. May as well take the time to stop and gorge on the cookies.<br /><br />The delicious, delicious cookies.

review/summary: If you want an old-fashioned, homemade taste in your cookies, Country Choice oatmeal raisin might be your cookie of choice ...
review/text: If you want a cookie that has that homemade, old-fashioned taste, Country Choice organic oatmeal raisin cookies will fit the bill.  They are rather pricey, but you do get what you pay for.  These cookies are individually wrapped and that makes it handy to put them in a lunchbox, backpack, or any portable bag.  They are quite soft so you can't expect them to be in one piece if you pack them with solid items like an apple.<br /><br />These cookies are small at just under 3" in diameter, so don't expect you are getting a box of giant sized cookies.  They are great for people who are trying to watch what they eat or are perfect for small hands.  I'll list the ingredients below for people who have special dietary needs or allergies.  All the nutritional facts for this product are on the company website.<br /><br />NOTE:  These cookies do contain egg, soy and coconut ingredients and are "Manufactured on shared equipment with milk, wheat, peanut and other tree nut containing products."<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Organic Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Organic Sugar, Organic Raisins, Organic Cane Syrup, Water, Organic Whole Grain Oat Flour, Organic High Oleic Sunflower and/or Safflower Oil, Organic Brown Rice Flour, Organic Honey, Organic Coconut, Organic Whole Eggs, Leavening (Baking Soda, Monocalcium Phosphate), Corn Starch, Sea Salt, Organic Vanilla Extract, Soy Lecithin, Guar Gum, Organic Cinnamon

review/summary: One of my favorite cookies
review/text: A cookie a day (or 2, depending on serving size) is one of my few indulgences. I discovered the Country Choice line at my local Wegman's originally. Their prices are good, but I think Amazon has them beat for the Oatmeal Raisin cookies.<br /><br />These cookies are individually wrapped. One cookie is a serving, at about 100 cals.<br /><br />I like that the cookie is soft, and the raisins are soft and still moist.<br /><br />I really like that the ingredients are organic.<br /><br />They're good tasting to me, not too sweet, not too anything. Just right.<br /><br />Along with their Vanilla Wafers, and Trader Joes' Almond Windmill cookies (and lately, their Southern Style Pecan cookies), these are definitely in my Top 5 Cookie list.<br /><br />Give them a try by buying a single box locally ... then come back and get the mega pack from Amazon.

review/text: These are the best organic oatmeal cookies I've been able to find.  I've been getting Mrs. Denson's for years, but they have raisins, without which I can do, and they're very good when they're not too crisp.  But I just saw these at Amazon, and decided to take a chance and give them a try.  I'm delighted with them.  They really are soft, not crunchy, they don't have any raisins, and they're packaged in individual sealed packets.  I've got a new standard cookie!

review/summary: Worst. Cookies. EVER.  *****review for Double Fudge Brownie flavor*****
review/text: I actually feel awful giving a bad review to a product manufactured by a company that might be a small, independent operation, but... dang, these are bad.  I checked the label before purchasing them b/c while I am all for the idea of organic, I did not want some crazy gluten-free, vegan, tasteless, saw dust biscuit.  These were neither gluten-free nor vegan, passing the test with real ingredients like whole eggs, flour and real chocolate.  I figured I was in for a treat.  WRONG.  Unfortunately, they are dry (even though they're "soft baked"), and flavorless.  They have that very specific, cardboard, non-flavor that you get with weirdo hippie-food.  (Nothing against weirdo hippies - they're great - it's just that sometimes their packaged food sucks.)<br /><br />Bottom line... if I'm going to indulge, I'd rather eat crappy cookies filed with unpronounceable sludge from some evil multinational.  Truth is, sometimes hydrogenated & high-fructose tastes better.<br /><br />P.S.  Despite the large photo on the large box, the cookies are quite small.  About 30% smaller than pictured.  Not cool.

review/text: I really like this cookie. First of all, there is nothing in the cookie that I don't feel comfortable eating. The majority of the ingredients are organic. The taste is sweet, but not overly done. I have the oatmeal chocolate chip and it really fits the bill as a good snack. At 100 calories - its just right.<br />Now, this isn't a meal replacement - it is kind of small so it won't fill you up. But the taste is really good and you can feel good eating it.  Not as sweet as many oatmeal cookies that you find, but you can definitely taste oatmeal and chocolate! I have these on SS. I think they are a good deal for the quality of the ingredients.<br /><br />Ingredient list:<br />Organic whole rolled oats, organic sugar, organic dark chocolate chips, water, organic high oleic sunflower oil, organic honey, organic brown rice flour, organic whole eggs, leavening, organic corn starch, sea salt, organic vanilla extract, guar gum, soy lecithin, organic cinnamon.<br /><br />100 calories<br />4 g fat<br />15 g carbohydrate<br />1 g fiber<br />8 g sugar<br />1 g protein

review/summary: BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES
review/text: In my opinion, these chocolate chip cookies are, by far, the best-tasting cookies I've ever eaten!  They're the only cookies I buy. I really like the soft texture of the cookies, the oatmeal flavor, and the melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness of the plentiful chocolate chips.  In addition, they're made with organic products and they are relatively low in calories (100 for a 23 gram cookie) and saturated fats (only 1 gram per cookie).  My suggestion is to try just one and see if you can resist having another  { : > )

review/summary: WORST PINE NUTS
review/text: I purchased these nuts based on prior reviews and because they seemed like a good value for my money. Boy, was I wrong!! The nuts were very small with black areas, not all like the picture. They were also tasteless. I would be ashamed to put these nuts into a salad or other dish where they can be seen. And I am sure they would ruin the taste of pesto. The old saying true: you get what you pay for. These nuts are cheap and lousy.

review/summary: Quick Delivery
review/text: These nuts arrived promptly and packaged well.  Their taste isn't the same as the pine nuts I've purchased from Costco or from other stores.  I don't know if I would purchase them again because their taste was subdued in stuffing, cookies and salads even after toasting them in the oven for a little while.  They are also longer and thinner in shape than the pine nuts I am used to using.  Nonetheless, they worked in a pinch when I wasn't able to find them in my area.
