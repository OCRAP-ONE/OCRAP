review/summary: Outstanding Instant Noodles
review/text: Best Ramen noodles I ever ate - I will be eating plenty of these as they are only 200 calories per package and make for an excellent snack.  I like dropping a jumbo egg (additional 80 calories with good protein) in for a poached egg effect as it gets close to the 3 minute boiling finish.  I will look forward to trying other Indomie flavors and products in the future.

review/summary: My favorite quick meal
review/text: These things are tasty. Flavorful but not too salty, a hint of spicy but not tongue-torching, moist but not oily. Of course they're easy to make, like any instant noodle product. One thing that's different from your run-of-the-mill pack of ramen is that these aren't soup noodles, so you'll need to pull out your colander to drain the noodles after they've cooked.<br /><br />My favorite way to make these into a heartier meal (1 pack probably won't fill up some big tummies) is pan-frying some cubes of tofu and seasoning with garlic and soy sauce. Top your noodles with the tofu and you've got a great lunch or dinner!<br /><br />I was pleased to see that these actually AREN'T terrible for you. A few highlights: (for 1 package/serving)<br />Calories: 210<br />Fat: 8g (12%)<br />Trans fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 400mg (17%)<br />Carbs: 30g (4%)<br />Protein: 4g (8%)<br /><br />Go for it! These delicious noodles are great by themselves but are also versatile - use your imagination :)

review/summary: Product recall issued in Taiwan
review/text: There is a Chinese article from Taiwan (found in yahoo-Hong Kong) that issued a product recall for all Indomie Noodles.  The test result from Taiwanese authorities shows that the product contained excess amount of preservatives. Although damage to human may not be immediate but prolonged consumption could lead to kidney disease.<br /><br />I, myself, used to love this product but I have reduced the consumption of all Instant Noodles from once a day to once every 3 to 4 months.  Best to stay away from these processed food especially one with a recall.<br /><br />([...])

review/text: This year I have gone back to using Mrs Wages mixes. They are fast and easy to use. I always recommend Mrs. Wages to all new canners. It's a great way to build your confidence in canning. And its a great way to get your canning done if you need to get it done fast. And this Salsa mix still lets you add your own touch to make it just a little hotter or a little different. Yet still get it done fast!

review/text: I was tired of buying small jars of mustard seed at the store at $4-$5 dollars each, this product is maybe 1/10 the price for an equivalent amount. While I like the price, the first of 3 bags I opened didn't seem very fresh. I made a balsamic mustard with it and it was good, but not quite as good as previous batches with McCormick mustard. I'll make a decision on whether or not to purchase this product again after I open bags 2 and 3.

review/summary: Fresher than the store's version
review/text: I have purchased Wakame from a well-known largely organic food store.  When I received this shipment from Amazon I was pleasantly surprised how fresh the seaweed was.  I didn't know it should NOT be dry and brittle (store purchase) and accepted it as a quality of dried seaweed.<br /><br />It is much easier to cut strips for homemade seaweed salad and much less expensive.  Overall, an excellent buy at nearly $2 per pkg cheaper.<br /><br />Update March 10, 2011*****<br /><br />I find if you cut it along the short way (width) before hydrating, instead of trying to cut it in long strips, it is almost the quality size that you can get from a restaurant when using Cuisanart kitchen shears.<br /><br />If you can, read/purchase a book called Seaweed- Nature's Secret to Balancing Your Metabolism, Fighting Disease, and Revitalizing Body & Soul By Valerie Gennari Cooksley, RN.  It is awesome!  You'll find yourself eating a greater variety of the greens.

review/text: I buy this product regularly and have it stocked on all times.  I'm a huge fan of Eden Foods, especially since it's a company that appears to have integrity regarding their products.  Anyways, this seaweed is great for soups (for adding another depth of flavor), or even to make seaweed salad, with a little vinegar, honey, soy sauce and minced garlic.  I soak the seaweed first and make sure to rinse the seaweed several times.  Then blanch it for about a minute, and then drain the water.  Then cut it up, and mix it with the above ingredients for a yummy side salad!

review/text: This is a really good product.  While it is only 4 ounces, it is actually about a quart of freeze dried shallots.  I have long used fresh shallots extensively in cooking, and these are an excellent replacementwhen "fresh" is not required (such as salads, etc).  They save all the work of peeling and chopping fresh shallots for cooking.  The product, while fairly costly (as are fresh shallots), is a real time saver, and worth every penny of the cost.  Freeze dried is much better than just plain dried.  I use freeze dried herbs whenever I can find them, as they more exactly replace fresh products.  If you use shallots, you will love this product.

review/summary: Tea is great, whats up with the price?
review/text: This tea is amazing I bought it on here when it was 22$ for the 24-pack and set up a once a month subscription. Now it says 60$ for a 24pack..who would pay that when its 99cents per can at the corner store. I will be cancelling my subscription and be watching the price more closely now. The tea is insanely good though just beware the price, it seems to fluctuate a lot. Only reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 is the changing price.

When you buy a can at walgreens its 99 cents, this price is $2.50 per can, that is just dumb!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />When I originally wrote this review the price was crazy, now its great, so I encourage you to buy this delicious razzleberry tea, its low calorie and tastes fantastic!

However I was disapponted to learn it really isn't all natural even though the can has statements that lead you to beleive it is. My teenage son noticed that it contains sucralose (i.e splenda).

Being I was getting a package of 10 bags, I was hoping the expiration date was far out and it was (June 2010) so am very happy.

review/summary: Excellent treat for pilling
review/text: My cat takes two types of heart medication; one is a small pill and the other is made up of divided granules from a human-sized capsule. I am always on the lookout for soft, pliable treats in which to insert her meds. Until I had picked up a bag of these treats, I had been using Whisker Lickins Tender Moments treats. However, those can get dried out by the time you get to the last half to third of the bag, rendering them useless for the pills. These are very soft, and while they're more expensive than other low-end brands, they stay fairly soft, even down to the last one. They're also much less expensive than Pill Pockets and can be bought in more retail outlets. The extra benefit of helping with hairballs is yet another plus!

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: I have tried every hairball remedy out there and this is definitely the best.  Why?  Because the cats will eat them with no problem.  It was always a battle to get any of the other remedies in the cats, half of it ended up on me or the fur or the floor.  The remedy is no good if you can't get it in the cat.  LOL!<br /><br />But every cat I have owned/own loves these "treats."  I do a maintenance feed once a week and when the shedding gets bad I do it every day for three days.  Even better, it gets great results.  No more surprise globs on the floor, no more hacking sounds in the middle of the night.  LOL!<br /><br /> I hardly ever give these 'Wow' reviews but this product deserves it!<br /><br />Also the price is about the same as the box stores but they don't always have them in stock so this is great too.

review/text: Our cat has medium lenght hair and like most cats grooms often. I started to notice that she was hacking a little & wasn't using the litter box as often,(#2)so i looked up online and it said she may have hairballs. There are a lot of black nasty pastes out there but its difficult to dose a cat with them. I only feed my cat Friskies so i went to the website and saw the hairball remedy treats. I couldnt find them at my local stores so i ordered them from amazon. My cat loves the taste and within a few days she was back to her old self. With this pack of 10 i should be well stocked for a while.

review/summary: Our carpets are saved!!
review/text: These things REALLY work!  I bought these based on all the positive reviews as a desperate attempt to find something that would stop our female tabby from throwing up 2-3 times a day, every time she ate.  I've been giving both our cats 3 a day (less than the "treament" amount but more than the "maintenance" amount), and in the past month, the tabby has thrown up maybe 2 or 3 times total.  Our boy cat, who had hairballs more rarely (maybe one every other week), hasn't had a single one since they started getting these.  And they absolutely LOVE them!  They're moist and chewy, and I've been able to train them both to sit up on their back feet on command for these treats.  I hadn't held out much hope for these since we'd already tried Petromalt and had switched them to expensive hairball formula cat food, but I was definitely surprised at how well they work.  Go for Subscribe & Save to save some money -- a box of 10 packs every 6 months is just about perfect, and if you wind up with too many, you can always skip or delay a shipment.

review/text: These are like candy for our cat, who goes crazy when she hears the bag rustle (or anything that sounds like it).  If you want to give your cats treats, they will probably love these.  They are also soft enough to wrap around a pill, so if you need to give your cat medicine they are a great option.  However, I only give 4 stars because I doubt the nutritional value of treats in general and I'm concerned with the almost addicting quality of these.

review/summary: Great Treats!
review/text: These treats are amazing.  I moved into a new condo with new carpet and I think my cat was licking herself constantly to get the carpet fibers off.  As a result, she was having hairballs at least three to four times a week.  Brand new carpet and hairballs are not the best combination!  I tried these treats after reading all the great reviews on here.  At first, I gave her at least six everyday and they slowly started to work.  After she went a couple days without a hairball, I started to give her four every other day.  They continue to work.  These are more expensive than other treats, but they are totally worth it if your cat has issues with hairballs.  My cat won't eat these as a treat, but I just put them in with her food and she eats them right away.  AWESOME product.

review/summary: Low fat, vegetarian, non-fried alternative to ramen, but a bit bland
review/text: There are 3 flavors in the annie chun "ramen house" lineup, and I recently tried this one, and the "soy ginger" flavor. The "ramen house" lineup includes a packet of pre-cooked noodles that are non-fried and low fat. They come soft unlike the hard brick that usually comes with ramen. There is also a liquid soup packet. This particular flavor I found to be somewhat bland. The noodles are cooked perfectly and are a good consistency. The soup is not spicy at all. If you added some tofu, vegetables, scallions, etc you can make a more filling meal out of it. I added some soy sauce and it improved the taste considerably.<br /><br />My recommendation is to go with the MUCH better (but not vegetarian) soy ginger flavor: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LL7C3M">Annie Chun's Soy Ginger, 4.9-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a> It has a much richer and better taste. However, if you are strictly vegetarian, this is still a decent alternative to regular ramen noodles. Another vegetarian option I find to be tastier then this is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E123IM">Annie Chun's Udon Soup Noodle Bowl, 5.3-Ounce Bowls (Pack of 6)</a>. It is also vegetarian, includes a few vegetables, a bowl to cook everything in, and is my favorite.<br /><br />If you aren't vegetarian, id try the other flavors first, but this flavor is still decent, especially when other ingredients are added. A little hot sauce would probably liven it up quite a bit. It also has a very reasonable amount of sodium compared to similar products. Its shelf stable and easy to make with either boiling water or a microwave. I pay about $1.50/ea in my local grocery - the amazon vendors often hike up the price where its not worth buying online.<br /><br />If you are looking for other vegetarian/vegan soup options similar to ramen, another brand to look for is "Thai Kitchen" and "Simply Asia". They offer some excellent rice noodle bowls and soups that are also gluten free as well: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZWDR2">Thai Kitchen Noodle Bowl, Roasted Garlic, 2.4-Ounce Unit (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />NOODLES: WATER, WHEAT FLOUR, TAPIOCA STARCH, SALT, WHEAT GLUTEN, LACTIC ACID, ACETIC ACID, RIBOFLAVIN (VITAMIN B2), SOUP BASE: ONION (ONION, WATER, CITRIC ACID), ORGANIC MUSHROOM BASE (ORGANIC MUSHROOMS, SALT, ORGANIC CANE SUGAR, ORGANIC MALTODEXTRIN, NATURAL FLAVORS, ORGANIC ONION*, ORGANIC SOYBEAN OIL, ORGANIC GARLIC*), ROASTED CABBAGE POWDER (CHINESE CABBAGE EXTRACT, MALTODEXTRIN, SUGAR, CORN OIL), WATER, CORN STARCH, MIREPOIX (MALTODEXTRIN, ONION, SALT, SUGAR, YEAST EXTRACT, CORN SALAD OIL, CARROT, CELERY, SPICES, RED WINE), GINGER (GINGER, WATER, CITRIC ACID), SALT, YEAST EXTRACT, GARLIC (GARLIC, CITRIC ACID), BLACK PEPPER, NATURAL FLAVORING (NATURAL FLAVORING, MALTODEXTRIN), WHITE PEPPER. *DEHYDRATED<br /><br />PRODUCT MANUFACTURED IN A FACILITY THAT USES, SOY, MILK, PEANUTS, TREE NUTS, EGGS, FISH AND SHELLFISH.

However, there is a distinctly playdough smell when you open the package of noodles, and as for the the flavor after cooking, well ... might have cooked real playdough and ate that instead. distinct vinegar taste to added flavor packet. All in all, i would prefer 10 cent top ramen over this.

review/summary: Annie Chun's Spring Vegetable Ramen
review/text: I stopped eating meat and dairy 8 months ago and really missed my ramen noodles. I have always kept the old trusty "ramen bricks" on hand for my kids or for just a quick lunch but they all consist of some animal product so i could no longer eat them. Then I discovered these. I was so excited when I saw on the label that they were Vegan. I was not disappointed either. They are really good. I had to add a little salt I will admit but I really expected to have to. I have discovered that anything labeled Vegan for some reason needs salt added. I have no idea why. But I really liked them. I will surely be buying more of these.

review/summary: Edible, I guess...
review/text: I like plenty of products from Annie Chun. They're usually a nice alternative to instant ramen...<br />I did not enjoy this, ok? It was bland and what wasn't bland was sour in a vinegary unpleasant way.Despite being called spring vegetable flavor, there were no vegetables to re-hydrate.<br />I got this at the grocery store and would not get it again.<br />Stickin to ramen and Nissin Chow mein, although I'm looking into nissin udon and some more authentic yakisoba (NOT maruchan).<br />I really like the annie chun's sticky rice, though. perfect for those days in college when you just need rice.

review/summary: bland and boring
review/text: I purchased a bag of this soup at my local grocery store and was so disappointed in its flavor; it had none.  Despite emptying a flavor packet into the broth, I might have just as well left the water with nothing added at all.<br /><br />While vegetarian, this product is not worth it. In addition to lacking taste, it is somewhat time consuming because it isn't a one-step process to get to the final product.  The directions tell the user to soak the noodles in hot water, drain the noodles, add room temperature water and then heat the product in the microwave.<br /><br />If you want some flavorful ramen, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFLTDM">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Miso Ramen, 1.9-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FC75X8">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Ramen Chicken Soup with Noodles, 1.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> and/or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017U24KG">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Chinese Noodle Soup,Lower Sodium, 1.4-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a>.  Their soups have some flavor and don't require the soaking of noodles and subsequent refilling of water.<br /><br />I'm so glad I did not buy these in bulk - definitely pick one up from the store before purchasing a good number of these.

review/text: Ramen is one of those items I like to keep on hand. After becoming vegan, I was hard pressed to find a ramen I could eat. Then I found this ramen at Whole Foods and decided it was so good, I had to buy it by the case!<br /><br />My favorite way to enjoy this ramen is to prepare as directed, but add miso, seaweed and sesame oil. DEEElicious!<br /><br />Also try Annie Chun's "ginger soy" flavor. It's pretty tasty too.

review/text: The Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Cookie Bar was not what I expected at all. It has a crispy outside, and blueberry filling on the inside.

review/summary: Lite cookie snack
review/text: I received this "Quaker STILA", which is advertized as a "crispy oat cookie bar with fruit filling"; in my case, with a `blueberry' filling.  I received this `bar' just about the time of its expiration date.  It had a distinct `crunchiness' about its shell that contained the grape filling, which meet its advertized "crispy" bar touting.  The `crunchiness' really did not distract from the product, as it wasn't `hard' from the sense that one had to force a bit through it - just a little more crunchy that what I was expecting.  But, as it was at its expiration date, it did seem to be a little `drier' and  `off taste' to me.  The shell had a nice cinnamon dusting on it that `kicked up' the enjoyment of eating the bar.  I also enjoyed the grape filling - it's consistency was sort of like a Fig Nutin.  The box touts that there are "100 calories Per Bar"  and "0g Trans Fat" -- which appears to be an appeal to the health-conscious or diet-minded eater.  Having had nothing for dinner the night before, one bar and a glass of milk quenched my immediate hunger pains on an early Sunday morning.  As I need a fuller breakfast, I need perhaps two of these to get me through the morning until lunch.  As, I don't see these cookie-bars as a replacement for my current bowl of cereal in the morning, I don't see myself in occasionally purchasing more of this product.

review/summary: Finally...moist done right!
review/text: I love cereal bars, I really, really do.  But the Nutrigrain, which has been the staple for the world, is just too most.  Special K's Cereal crisps are okay, but a little too crisp.  Where's the middle ground?  Right here.  These Oat Cookies are the perfect blend of crisp, oaty, and moist to satisfy the most discerning connosieur.  What I loved the most, though, is that the blueberry flavor is not overpowering.  Obviously there's some artificiality to it, but the blueberry is not too much, nor too little.  Makes a great snack or lunch compliment.

My husband could have taken it or left it, and I liked the flavor but the texture I am still not sure about, it was a little too crunchy I think, but I'd eat them again I am just not sure I'd spend my money on these instead of buying something else that we prefer and is more well received be everyone the same in out house.  I was also disappointed that the box arrived in a bubble envelope and was quite crushed, the bars were all broken inside to some degree.

review/text: These Stilia bars are wonderful. They taste great, are only 100 calories and my whole family loved them - especially the rabbits. They're quite filling and the juxtoposition of a crunchy outside with a jam-like inside made for an excellent snack. The only downside is that we haven't been able to find these in our local supermarkets. I will say that these are extremely fragile and that sometimes you'll end up with some broken bars before you even open the wrapper. Doesn't make them taste any less awesome though!

review/text: I've eaten Nutri-Grain bars on and off for a while, usually because I'm lazy and don't like to cook in the morning.  These are a little better than the Nutri-Grain bars if only because they're crunchy.  The chewiness of the Nutri-Grain bars makes them seem even more bland than they usually are, whereas with the Stila bars the crunchiness livens it up a little, making it almost seem like you're eating a pastry instead of something good for you.  So as long as it's competitively priced I'd recommend it.<br /><br />That is all.

review/summary: Lighter Alternative to a Pop Tart
review/text: At 100 calories, The Crispy Oat Cookie Bar is good for a snack. They are small-a little more than half the size of a toaster pastry--but tasty. The crust is crunchier than a Pop Tart, more cookie like, with a sprinkling of oatmeal. The filling is just like a toaster pastry, which makes them very yummy. They were gone pretty quickly in my house. These are ideal for portion control snacking, just throw one in your lunch bag. However, they wouldn't make a good breakfast for anyone other than a toddler, since they are rather small to fill you up.

review/summary: Mediocre taste and nutrition stats.
review/text: I enjoy eating breakfast bars when I'm in a rush and want something light.  Unfortunately, this Quaker Stila Bar did not live up to my expectations.  The center is blueberry flavored, but I did not get a strong blueberry flavor (it instead had a purely artificial flavor).  I didn't care for the texture either (if you want something crispy, I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317HLQA">Special K Fruit Crisps, Blueberry, 10-Count Bars (Pack of 6)</a>).<br /><br />The nutrition does not make up for the mediocre taste.  It's only 100 calories per bar, which isn't bad at all, but there are only 2 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber.  From my breakfast bar, I'd prefer a bar with more fiber and/or protein, to ensure I don't get hungry quickly.

review/summary: Good if you like cereal bars and crunchy things
review/text: This is similar to the common fruit-filled cereal bars you find in the grocery stores, the difference being instead of the bar being soft, it's crunchy. The fruit filling is sandwiched between two cracker-like halves. That's the main selling point: the crunch. Taste-wise it's exactly like the soft cereal bars--I didn't notice a difference.<br /><br />The downside to being crunchy is it is more prone to making crumbs, although I never had a problem with large pieces of cracker falling off, as the filling helps keep it all stuck together.

review/summary: A Delicious and Interesting addition to the snack bar world
review/text: These bars are crunchy and not soft like many others which is their key differentiating factor.  The crumble apart approach seemed to give this a more substantial feel than other bars as I crunched through them.  Nice flavor in that they are not too sweet, but sweet enough.  I love the fact that they are simple and straightforward with 100 calories.  You can eat these relatively guilt free and they were excellent for me when going out the door in the morning to get something in my stomach on the way to work and eat while driving.  A really nice addition to the sometimes bland snack bar world.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Fruity and Low Calorie
review/text: I am a big fan of cereal bars and use them as a snack or meal supplements all the time. Most of them are a nutritious and tasty alternative to the more caloric snacks and candy bars, and I genuinely enjoy their taste. These blueberry cookie bars are no exception. Overall I like their taste, although they are not my favorites. The outer cookie layer is a bit too dry for my liking, while the fruity part is a bit too mushy. The overall texture of this bar is similar to the untoasted pop-tart. One thing that I like about these bars is that they are very low calorie and nutritious - only 100 calories, 1.5 g fats and 0.5 g saturated fat. So if eating (relatively) healthily is one of your primary concerns then these cookie bars have a lot going for them.

review/summary: Eating one right now
review/text: Quaker blueberry stila-good for a snack or breakfast.  I received this product and I was impressed with the packaging-a cute box that is a slanted rectangle.  The product is obviously packaged for women, who think neat product packages are great and thus more marketable.  The lack of calories also makes it a product likely to appeal to women-per bar, it is only 100 calories.<br /><br />Taste is another matter.  The product states it is naturally and artificially flavored.  The oat cookie bar is utterly tasteless-the only thing that saves this bar is the fact that it has blueberry filling in it.  In order to save calories however, there really is not enough blueberry filling to mask the tastelessness of the oat bar.  The blueberry filling also tastes artificial, and like the filling of a blueberry poptart rather than a "health" bar, that has 0 trans fat.<br /><br />Overall, if possible I would give this 3.5 stars, due to the low calorie and the low sugar content of the food.  However this is not a product I would buy-when I try to be healthy, I eat plan yogurt or plan oatmeal.  I think the purpose of this bar is the convenience of it-you can just open it anywhere and eat, such as at your office or in your car.  For me though I think I will prepare breakfast food from now on, as I simply do not find breakfast bars satisfying.

review/text: This snack is somewhere between a fig newton (filling on the inside), a granola bar (crunchy and easy to carry) and a cookie (sweeter than most granola bars). I received one box and used them as an afternoon snack.<br /><br />the pros: One hundred calories. Fairly tasty. Portable. Better tasting than a lot of other 'low calorie' snacks.<br /><br />the cons: Some artificial flavorings. Fairly heavily processed. Mostly carbs, which is a concern for me.<br /><br />I'll probably stick with protein or Zone Diet bars as an afternoon snack going forward. The Quaker Stila bars are tastier but the others I mentioned are better for my overall nutritional needs.

They come individually wrapped and I like to throw a couple into my purse for sudden hunger pangs after my gym workout.<br /><br />They are made with real blueberries and have none of the artificial taste some other snack products can have.

I also try to avoid palm oil, another unhealthy ingredient in these. I will throw an apple in my purse for a snack from now on.

review/summary: High Fructose Corn Syrup - and other problems
review/text: I trusted the Quaker Oats Company to bring me a wholesome, safe snack. So as soon as I received the box of "Stila, crispy oat cookie bar with fruit filling" I pulled out a blueberry cookie bar and devoured it. It had a nice ratio of crunch to sweet filling and I thought it would be a good snack to keep on hand. It wasn't until a few minutes later, when I started to feel really bad, that I actually read the box in greater detail.<br /><br />The first item listed in the blueberry filling was high fructose corn syrup - not blueberries. Additionally, there was modified corn starch, sorbitol, palm oil, and a host of not very healthy ingredients. Further down the list (after canola oil and wheat gluten,) I found another listing of high fructose corn syrup - stuff so bad, they don't allow it to be sold in other civilized countries, like Germany.<br /><br />With ingredients this bad, I wondered how even the USA would allow it to be marketed. Then I noticed it was made in Mexico - distributed by Quaker in the USA. The ultimate two-time corporate sellout - make it with cheap poisonous ingredients and pay (cheaply, no doubt) for it to be made in another country. Shame on you, Quaker Oats Company!

review/summary: Crispy Tasty low cal pastry bar!
review/text: I first tried these because they were on special at less than a dollar for a box of 6 with on pkg coupon. I chose the apple cinnamon. At first i was unsure if i liked them or not but after i got past the fact that they are not the over the top sugary sweet granola type bar that hurts your teeth from all the sugar i liked them more and more. A week later i decided to search them out and try a different flavor. I found them and they were still very reasonably priced even though not on sale. About half the price of a similar sized box of granola bars or other breakfast or cereal bars. I bought both blueberry and strawberry.  I love the blueberry. I agree with the reviews comparing it to an adult pop tart.  To those who find this a negative comment, many of us still love pop tarts but don't eat them because of the high calorie count. Numerous other comments claimed they were 'tasteless and bland' and they would rather eat plain oatmeal or plain yogurt!  What is more tasteless and bland than plain oatmeal or plain yogurt???  Several other comments recommended just eating a real pop tart but only eat half, or to only eat part of a granola bar for the same calories...seriously???  How many of you out there that have weight problems can honestly eat half of anything and save the rest for later?? If we could, we wouldn't be overweight.  Most of us have trouble stopping at one bar!  If you would rather eat an apple or carrot sticks why even try these? On the other hand if you are watching your calories and need a sweet treat to keep you out of the cookie jar or vending machine at work, these are an excellent option if you prefer a lightly sweet crispy treat. If at first they don't seem sweet enough, give them another chance.  Once you get used to not having the overpowering sweetness of granola bars you will love these!<br />Oh, one more comment on the manufacturing of these bars in Mexico. Consider that maybe these bars were originally produced for customers in Mexico and their popularity prompted Quaker to try them out in the US? Many popular products now consumed in the US originally were produced and sold soley in other countries and when their popularity grew, they eventually found their way to the US.  Swiss chocolates, Mexican salsas, French pastries, Italian pasta & sauces etc.<br />To sum it all up, these are very tasty, crispy, low cal snack bars. Very reasonably priced at about 1/2 the cost for a similar size pkg of other bars. (compare to kelloggs special k pastry bars. You get 2 for the same amt of calories but they are super thin and not as crunchy or hearty as Stila bars) Overall 4 enthusiastic stars!  I would give 5 stars if they had more flavors and stevia based sweeteners instead of hf corn syrup and sugar.

review/text: Have you ever gotten a jelly filled donut only to discover after biting into it that all the jelly got squished out somewhere along the way? That's hat Stila bars taste like. Except there's no doughy, sugary outside to enjoy. Just brittle, grainy, stale cracker that needs to be washed down with a quart of milk because it takes days to get the metallic aftertaste of artificial sweetner out of your mouth. There's some kind of fruit paste clotted on the bottom of the thing, but you can't taste it over the sugar-free pop-tart "oat" bar surrounding it. Bleh. Can I have a diet, caffeine free, low-sugar, non-flavored rice cake instead?

review/summary: Good concept, but where is the filling?
review/text: Stila is a toasted crunchy cookie type bar with rolled oaks sprinkled on the top. I really like it because of the crunch factor, and also because it is not overly sweet. However, the first ingredient is the filling and high fructose corn syrup. There are also several artificial ingredients, including blue dye.  It has somewhat of a biscuit flavor, which I like. I would have given Stila four stars except for the fact that Quaker really skimped on the filling, leaving it very dry and lacking in blueberry flavor. In fact Stila's "blueberry" flavor is barely detectable.  The word "filling" in my mind has a connotation of being a significant component like a turnover or pie filling.  Stila's so called "filling" does not qualify.  Still I like Stila mainly for the texture and even thought it lacks the "wow factor" I may try it again sometime. Quaker don't be so stingy with the "filling," and what the heck does Stila mean anyway?

The cracker part was okay, a little flakie perhaps but its flavor wasn't too bad.  The blueberry filling was very tasty so that to us over road the cracker part. Not bad at 100 cal for one, because one seems to quanch the urge to nibble.  We liked them. I'm sure we will purchase them.

review/summary: Not that good...
review/text: When trying these my wife and I both came the consensus that this is basically a pre-toasted pop tart, but about half the size.<br /><br />We don't have anything against pop-tarts (we quite like a few flavors), but were we to want a pop-tart, we would've just gotten them.<br /><br />Definitely not impressed with the taste, texture, or value of these cookie bars.

review/summary: Eh
review/text: This cookie bar is okay - if you prefer your healthy snacks on the sweet side.<br /><br />The outside is cruncy and crumbly (eat over a plate) and doesn't taste too bad.  The inside is a creamy blueberry concoction that reminded me of eating a cold, blueberry Pop-Tart. Which is not something I would recommend.<br /><br />It appears to only be 100 calories with a carb count of 18. There are better options than this one out there.

review/summary: Stick with fruit or another healthy snack
review/text: I liked the blueberry flavor of these cracker bars, but the cracker itself is somewhat bland and way too crumbly.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good taste like a mini Pop Tart<br />Only 100 calories<br />Zero transfats<br />Convenient size<br /><br />Cons:<br />Expensive packaging that is wasteful<br />Too expensive for what you get<br />Made in Mexico...sad for Quaker<br />Too much sugar (first filling ingredient is high fructose corn syrup)<br />Too many chemicals and additives<br />Crumbling, dry cracker is messy

review/summary: A good company making a bad product
review/text: I was ready to give these bars a middling review based on taste, until I read the ingredients.  That was the end for me, but I'll come back to that later.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that the crust around the fruit filling resembles a pop tart.  Not my idea of a quality product I'd want to imitate.  The crust is dry with not much flavor except sweetness.  The filling is even more disappointing  - also dry, thin and not really tasting of blueberry at all, but also sweet.  So, OK, the flavor is mediocre at best.  But, if you want a portable sweet snack, I thought these bars might be acceptable in limited quantity.<br /><br />But then I looked at the ingredients and it was all over.  What are the FIRST TWO ingredients?  high fructose corn syrup and sugar.  Well, that accounts for the sweetness without much other flavor.<br /><br />So the bottom line is:  Poor flavor and hazardous to your health.  It doesn't get much worse than that.<br /><br />Zero stars if I could, but, in Amazon's system, one star is what I give.

review/summary: nice texture but flavor and ingredients seem like graduating from pop-tarts
review/text: A pleasingly crisp exterior conceals a thin layer of oversweet filling.  The ingredients list explains why: High Fructose corn syrup shows up twice, as does regular sugar and brown sugar.  The taste/texture combo made me think of an adult version of pop-tarts.<br /><br />I'm a fan of natural foods (and minimalism in processed foods), so the long list of artificial ingredients in these bars is major turn-off.  Considering HFCS's reputation, why not use regular corn syrup?  FDC Red #40, why?? And there's a laundry list of preservatives as well.  Especially off-putting considering that the marketing and packaging both seem to trumpet the food's wholesomeness.<br /><br />Portability might be a plus, except the GF commented on how the bar crumbled as she ate it in the car, leaving crumbs all over her lap.  Why not a thicker layer of natural fruit preserves (much like Stonewall Kitchens preserves are made of all natural ingredients), to make this actually fruity and wholesome?<br /><br />Recommended for coaxing people off pop-tarts, but those of you who already enjoy "adult" food will not be impressed.  I won't repeat.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: These bars are quite tasty and a little crumbly. If you factor in the weight to calorie ratio, they are about the same,(ratio wise),to Nature Valley bars. The Amazon or Quaker description says 5.5 ozs. However each bar is only 0.91 ozs. The whole package of 6 weigh 5.5 oz. But I did give them 4 stars on taste because of my particular fondness for anything blueberry. One would have to check pricing per ounce with other brands for the value conscious.

review/text: Wow, these went fast in my household. Everybody loved them. They are quite delicious and their crispy/chewy textures really make for a nicely sized snack. I think we have a new favorite snack bar. Everyone can't wait to try some other flavors.<br /><br />If you like fruit filled bars, then you aught to really try these. They are really good.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: These Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Bars are delicious.  The perfect cross between a cookie and your traditional nutri grain style granola bar, they are a great snack.  We have been watching our diets recently, and these seem to be a better choice than many other granola bars--with only 100 calories (about 30 less than what we normally eat) and they don't seem any less filling.

review/summary: Surprisingly tasty, and crunchy
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised at how these 100 calorie bars tasted.  I've tried a lot of whole grain cardboard tasting health snacks, and these are some of the first that had good taste, and low calories, while not making me feel I was eating something mixed with sawdust.<br /><br />The berry filling is fine -no complaints, but what really sets this apart is the crunch you get when biting into it.<br /><br />I'm tired of eating oat bars that are soft, or that have to have 300 calories of chocolate or sugar to get you to eat it.  This bar has neither, but still tastes pretty good.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Nice portable snack
review/text: These bars arrived on not only my one day off, but a day I planned on spending at the beach. Perfect way to really give these a trial by fire and see how they performed in a high calorie burning day. We were gone all day: hiking, swimming, sunning and playing frisbee; by 3:00 p.m. the box was empty! LOL I read in other reviews that people were disappointed that the "filling" wasn't "filling" or "filled" to the level they thought it should be. When my family ate these, we throught they were like Fig Newtons, where you have a very cooked jam sandwiched between two crunchy layers, NOT a Hostess Fruit Pie, which is what I think some reviewers wanted. For an "On the Go" snack, these held up beautifully. The temps that day were 98 degrees, 112 degrees on the actual sand. They didn't melt or stick and eaten with a thermo cup of fresh lemonade, they were filling, tasty and delightful. Are they a 400 calorie blueberry muffin with streusal topping? Heck no! They're a portion and calorie controlled snack meant to take the edge off of your hunger so you don't go mental at Dunkin Donuts. ~snort~  All in all, my family enjoyed them and wondered what other flavours would be available to buy.<br /><br />**And as other's have asked: "What the heck is a Stila????" I know there's a good pun in there somewhere. ;)

review/summary: Crunchier, Bigger Fig Newton's
review/text: When I first saw these I was expecting them to taste and feel like a bunch of Fig Newton's together and smooched down.  The Quaker Stila Cookie Bars turned out to be a bit crunchier than I expected somewhere in-between a Fig Newton and a cracker, but much closer than the cracker.  Since it is crunchy, you are going to have a few crumbs, but the blueberry center does make this a decent snack.

review/summary: Good taste but dry and hard
review/text: I know they're supposed to be cookie bars, but even hard cookies are a bit easier to chew than these are. Also, the fact that they are hard and very dry does not make them cookies. They taste good and the filling kind of reminds me of that in Pop Tarts, except that these don't hurt my stomach like Pop Tarts do. They're sweet but it isn't over the top. A little moisture would make these bars much more agreeable.
