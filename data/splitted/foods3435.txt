review/summary: Love Dr. McDougall products
review/text: This is one of my favorite Dr. McDougall products.  I love that the soup is loaded with noodles, has a mild flavor and is a breeze to make for lunch.  Like most of this line, the soup cup's contents are dry and the user must add water and the flavor packet and pop the cup in the microwave for several minutes.  I generally think the company suggests too much water for the products and that is no exception for the miso soup.  I always place less water than recommended in the soup cup in order to produce a slightly thicker broth that is more concentrated in flavor.  The miso soup may have too much sodium for some but calorie wise, this cannot be beat.  With a little garden salad on the side, the user gets a very satisfying lunch.  One annoying aspect of McDougall products is that all the "big cups" are two servings.  The contents, however, really seem equivalent to one serving. Just be sure to double the calories if you keep a calorie log or are trying to keep an accurate picture of your sodium intake.<br />'

review/summary: Decent product
review/text: Not bad...just a little bland and not much in the cup.  I add some more "stuff" to it and use it as a base.  I realize that's not the point of an instant soup, but if you're prepping it at home and have time to add some more items to it, it's fantastic!  I add some additional wakame seaweed, fresh tofu, brewer's yeast, a pinch of sea salt and black pepper.  I'm sure shitake mushrooms would be great too, but I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />I'm a much bigger fan of the Vegan Curry with Brown & Wild Rice Pilaf, perfect as is, no additional ingredients required and HIGHLY addictive! :)<br /><br />BTW, AVOID the Vegan Black Bean & Lime Soup at all costs.  It's absolutely disgusting: hard to mix, smells like BO, and tastes bland.

review/summary: contains mystery ingredients
review/text: I keep coming back to this brand because it is "almost" healthy.  I just can't get past the 2 questionable ingredients: yeast extract & natural flavors. These are 2 ingredients that almost always contain MSG.  If they didn't, why would they be in there with such odd names. Why wouldn't it just say flour or carrots?  When I make soup at home I never add anything called natural flavors, and wouldn't know where to get yeast extract.  These are unnecessary ingredients that I am guessing are not so natural and are probably flavor enhancers.  I wouldn't care so much, but MSG in any form gives me a headache. If the ingredients read "MSG" or "Monosodium Glutamate" many customers would avoid the product. Hence the need to be covert.  Google MSG and read how many ingredients (additives) actually contain MSG. Very frustrating.

review/text: I was very disappointed in this.  The noodles had the flavor of cardboard..absolutely no "miso" soup taste at all and I love miso soup.  It did have lots of chunks and good things so it looked appealing but no taste.  I even checked the date for freshness but that was fine.  Unfortunately I don't recommend this one.

review/text: I love this soup! I keep it in my trunk, in my desk at work, and in my cabinet at home. Anytime I don't feel like cooking I just pop one in the microwave. It's good food. As long as you follow the directions, make sure the water is hot enough if using a weak microwave, and make sure to let it sit as long as the directions say, it's hard to screw it up. My picky nephew will eat one of these before he'll eat most snack foods too.

review/summary: Love it
review/text: There are a lot of mixed reviews for this soup, but I'm pretty much in love with it. The flavor is unlike any other miso soup I have had and the noodles are perfect. I like to eat this slowly and savor every bite and sip of the broth. Much less salt and fat than traditional "cup-o-noodle"-type products, but with much more flavor. Some people like it, some don't, but considering how much I love it I think it's worth the $2 to try for yourself.<br /><br />edit: Cook it in a nonstick pan with a bag of frozen vegetables until the water steams out for a creamy noodle meal.

review/summary: Too shroomy
review/text: I like the noodles themselves, and as has been written here before, they're relatively plentiful for this sort of product.  The killer for me is that the broth is fairly well pervaded with mushroom taste, which is a real turn-off, and IMHO anomalous for a product describe as miso-flavored.  I'm fortunate that a certain local Japanese place offers fish-free miso soup, but we also make it at home (or use the Miso-cup instant).  For noodle cups, I'll stick with the chicken-flavor variety.<br /><br />Others have written complaining of salt and that the flavor doesn't knock their socks off.  I submit that this is the what you get in the dehydrated instant soup cup arena.  Tasty volatiles by nature aren't going to be captured in a dry broth powder, so there's only so good any product like this is going to be. If there wasn't a fair amount of salt added, it wouldn't taste like much at all -- this is true of anyone's soup cups.<br /><br />The tradeoff is that these are inexpensive, extremely lightweight, and last indefinitely on the shelf.  I use them for late night snacks, and especially when I crew sail races -- the boat owner generally has various processed food items to offer, but they're nearly always laden with animal products.  I can throw a couple of these in my bag and when hot water is available, have something warm to put in my stomach when I'd be otherwise limited to chips or such.  The value of this is not to be underestimated when it's 45 degrees and raining with 20 knot winds.

review/summary: Experiment
review/text: I have tried several Dr. McDougall's Vegan soups with three different microwaves.  The time needed in each has been quite different - from needing less (to avoid boiling over) to needing more.  The soup should to be very hot but not hot enough to boil over.  I believe many complaints of "chewy" pasta/noodles/veggies is probably from unwillingness to experiment with cooking and standing times.

review/summary: Tasty. But.....
review/text: Good:<br />+ Nice noodles while being low-fat.<br />+ Keeps a long time, handy to have in the office (especially if you have an electric kettle)<br />+ Tasty without being as salty and fat-filled as the competition.<br /><br />Not so Good:<br />+ The labeling (at least as of 8/2012) is that a cup is TWO SERVINGS!  Wonder how they got a filling meal to be just 90 calories? They cut it in half.  If you live in a world where there is someone special in your life who will split a cup of soup with you, good for you.  But that just ain't working for most people.  I would rather they stuck with realistic labeling and called this a 180 calorie lunch.  This is the reason I gave this meal 4 stars rather than 5.<br />+ The miso-ness (misosity?) of this soup is not as strong as I would expect.  It's much more subtle than you'd get at a Japanese restaurant.  However - IT'S A DRIED CUP OF SOUP, so what did I expect?<br /><br />Summary:<br />Overall, something that you will find comforting as a backup lunch if you are stuck at your desk, that won't make you fall off your diet too badly.

review/summary: Tastes awful AND is high in sodium
review/text: I agree with some reviewers that this is bland and tasteless, but I'd go as far as to say it tastes weird. I'm a huge fan of miso, and this didn't have any miso taste to it. My cup also had 2 tiny pieces of seaweed, 1 TINY mushy piece of what I'm guessing was supposed to be tofu, and no mushrooms.<br /><br />I also read the nutrition facts and it had a LOT of sodium, which is shocking since it tasted so bland. Moreover, it said 1 of these 1.9 ounce cups is 2 servings. That's preposterous. How could 1 oz. of anything (even with the addition of bland broth) count as a serving? I think they only made it into 2 servings because otherwise, 1 of these cups would probably be 50+% of your daily sodium allowance? I threw my cup away, so I can't check it, but believe me, it had a shocking amount of sodium for gross, bland noodles.

review/text: I have ordered and eaten many McDougal foods. I have had great luck losing weight with his products and when I had to lose 20 pounds I ordered the foods I used to like and lost the 20 in one month. This Miso "soup" was one of the most awful, horrendous and disgusting foods I've ever ordered from this company or any company!! I'm so mad because they do not allow returns of food items even though 5 of them are un-opened. I tried over and over again to microwave this product but the noodles will not cook correctly. Over and over again they continue to stay stiff and distasteful. I will give credit when credit is due and tell you that many of his foods are good. I don't understand why this is so bad. The best foods he has are his oatmeal breakfasts and some of the rice combos. I can't say often enough how disappointed I am with this particular cup of mush! Don't waste your money on this. Noodles my a*#. What were they thinking???

I let it stay for 20 mins and then take it. It has mushrooms, so some vegan people even avoid it. Otherwise tastes good. The pouch inside can be hard to tear open if you are not familiar where exactly to open it. Overall I give a 5 star rating and recommend it for occasional uses.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I've been a McDougall customer since 2004, and I've tried almost all of the food cups.  They are excellent for those who want a vegan, mostly-organic alternative, and of course one pays extra for the convenience and vegan/organic ingredients.<br /><br />The Miso-Ramen soup is good.  When one opens the cup and removes the flavor packet, there's a hockey-puck-shaped packet of noodles.  That's the way it's supposed to look; letting them seep in hot water as per directions will expand them normally.  One gets a full cup of noodles as a result.  The taste is good and somewhat true to Miso.  The food is best eaten as is; this isn't a cup that works well poured over pasta, rice, or a baked potato.

review/summary: Bland, weird ramen
review/text: I've tried several of Dr. McDougall's products and typically find them tasty. This miso noodle soup however, is pretty nasty. The noodles are ramen, but not GOOD ramen. They are thin, flat, and have a strange aftertaste and texture. The flavor of the soup itself isn't miso, but a bland approximation of it. It tastes more like a watered down salty broth. There isn't much wakame, and a few more tiny chucks of tasteless tofu. This has been sitting in my cupboard for months and will continue to sit there until I run out of absolutely everything else. I'd give it away, but I don't want the recipient to be mad at me when they taste this stuff.

review/summary: Pleasant mild broth, nice ingredients,  but the noodles lack something
review/text: I used to have miso soup all the time, until I developed a seafood allergy (of serious dimensions, as in trips to the ER). Since being diagnosed (twice, yeah, two trips to the ER for separate dining out incidents), I was told strictly to avoid fish/shellfish. So, no more restaurant miso soup for me, as it generally  made with fish stock.<br /><br />This is how I get my miso soup fix. The broth is lovely (if not exactly the flavor of authentic restaurant Japanese miso soup), that mild, gentle flavor, the strips of seaweed also mild. This soup has tiny bits of soy protein (nice addition) and has some mushroom (which is why the broth is so nice, I think) and, of course, green onions.<br /><br />However, one star off for the noodles. I found the serving of noodles generous in ratio to broth, but I didn't find the texture or flavor satisfying.  Usual store-bought ramen, I guess, has a lot more fat than this very low-fat soup, and fat affects texture/flavor. So, if you're used to the cheap supermarket ramen--which, I'll admit, I do like-- this will not be the same.<br /><br />But I'd buy it again for the broth, and leave out the noodles or break the serving down to a smaller portion.<br /><br />For those of you used to vegan/low-fat ramen, this should not be a problem. I just am spoiled with fattier ramen soups.<br /><br />Lots of plusses, though--organic noodles, simple ingredients, lowfat, easy to fix (I pour in boiling water and in a couple of minutes, done), microwaveable (for the brown-bagging contingent).<br /><br />Another useful product from Dr. McD that won't break your caloric bank at 180 cals per container and which offers only 1 gram of fat. Other nutritional facts per container: 680 grams of sodium, 2 grams of fiber, 36 grams of carbs, 8 grams of protein.<br /><br />I hope Dr. McD makes a vegan miso without noodles in the future, simply adding more tofu, green onions, and dehydrated mushrooms to punch it up. I'd prolly give that one 5 stars. :)

review/summary: I love this walnut oil
review/text: I love this walnut oil. I've tried two other brands of French walnut oil, and of the three, this one is my favorite. It's very aromatic, very nutty, and very clean and fresh tasting. No off notes in its smell or taste (unlike some other walnut oils I've tried). It does NOT have a strong roasted flavor, and I prefer this type of walnut oil.<br /><br />I strongly recommend it in vinaigrettes, either as the only oil, or half-and-half with a good extra virgin olive oil. It is wonderful with sherry vinegar. I also use it when making a miso-walnut pesto.

review/summary: Disappointing, low quality
review/text: I bought 3 bottles of this oil after reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews for it. Sadly, I was not impressed with the quality of the product. Upon opening one bottle, my nose was assaulted by a strange fishy odor, not quite what I was expecting. It smelled as if I had opened a container of tuna fish salad. Now, I'm open to subjective dissonance, and that it very well could be just my own nose that was picking up these funny smells off of the oil. So I proceeded to experiment with it in the manner I had planned... I made mayonnaise.<br />Some people will tell you making mayo at home is tricky, and that it doesn't always work well... I've *always* had success, however... Before now.<br />This oil produced my very first batch of failed/separated mayo. I've made mayo countless times with other brands of walnut oil, always successfully. This oil, I feel (on conclusion of 3 batches of mayo/different eggs) is odd, off smelling, and tastes not quite rancid, but somehow funky none the less.<br />Yes, it is a good deal. Yes, it arrived promptly. But I found this oil to be substandard, unpleasant, and incapable of holding an emulsion. For my purposes, I won't be purchasing this product again.

review/summary: consistently fine
review/text: I like walnut oil more with time and now I use it for most meals. It's great with rice and  sweet dishes. This oil is a source of omega-3 which allegedly is good for health and I've experienced no negative reactions to it and I'm sensitive to many foods. I used to buy the La Tourangelle brand, but some of their cans were bitter whereas the Le Moulin de Marie brand is consistently mild in my experience.

review/text: We were skeptical that any packaged cookie mix could deliver moist and delicious cookies but Betty Crocker's Molasses Cookie Mix proved us wrong. Quick to make, about 10 minutes mixing and placing on the cookie sheet, and the aroma is fantastic. Just the right combination of chewy texture and exterior crispness, nice color and flavor! Easy enough for kids to help with the project, so this mix is a great rainy day kitchen project!

I think most people prefer cherry so I can understand why they would put more of that in each box. The cotton candy flavor are really awesome as well. A few usually come broken but that is also understandable as it is being shipped. I just open the broken ones and put them into a bowl. just as yummy! Even if 6 or 7 come broken it's better then buying lollipops form the store that are not as good, and I never see the charms brand sold in any of the stores I have checked. Ten bucks for 48 lollipops you can beat it. Totally worth it.

review/summary: Christmas Tradition for Baking
review/text: Each holiday season I purchase Wilton's Snowflake Sprinkle Mix -- it has become a family tradition. When I am particularly hurried the sprinkle adds a festive touch to plain bake goods like cupcakes, sheet cakes and of course, cookies. I like the mix because it is a bit different than the usual plain colored sugars and multi-colored sprinkles yet the design is clear and easy to identify. Other specialty sprinkles are sometimes too complex to create in such a small size and the result is muddled -- what are those little brown things -- gingerbread men?<br /><br />In past seasons I have included the Snowflake Sprinkle Mix in my Thanksgiving gifts to friends and family who bake to mark the approach of Christmas.

review/summary: Not only saves $$$ ... It's tasty, terrific, healthy and easy!
review/text: We're suffering a heat wave, and it was a sweltering 103 degrees here yesterday. Since my air conditioner went out and the repairman couldn't come until Monday, my daughter Allie decided to get me out of the heat ... a drive to see some friends, followed by a nice dinner in a cool, relaxing restaurant.<br /><br />The ac in her car felt like Heaven, so after I got comfortable, I reached for my water bottle.  When I did, Allie handed me this tiny packet (resembled an elongated version of those packets of salt in fast-food places), instructing me to pour it into my water. She knew I liked Crystal Light lemonade, so thought I would like this too. My bottle held 16.9 ounces of water and since I had already drunk half, it was perfect for eight ounces of this delicious drink. I tapped the powder into the water, swirled the bottle to mix it well, then took a sample sip. I liked it so well, I gulped with gusto.<br /><br />I've always appreciated the health benefits of green tea and the flavor of mangos, so it was a no-brainer that I'd like this tasty beverage. How well my daughter knows me!<br /><br />Allie nodded when I told her I had never seen these tiny packets, since the lemonade had come in small tubs that made an entire pitcher, and she laughed when I raved over the convenience and ease of use, marveling at the genius of the manufacturer.<br /><br />When I came on-line to order this viitamin-enhanced green tea peach mango mixture and the lemonade for the kids, I did some quick math, realizing that when mixed with filtered tap water, the price per eight ounces is thirty-two and one-quarter cents a bottle. I prefer the 16-oz. bottles, so I use two of these packets, which figures to be sixty-four and a-half cents. ... Much cheaper than soda--and decidedly tastier and healthier!<br /><br />I ordered this mixture for myself and lemonade flavor for my grandchildren. Johnny doesn't like water too much, so hogs every bottle of soda that we buy. I plan to give him his own supply to take to school because they fit so easily into his pocket and are so easy to mix on the run.<br /><br />One final tip Allie passed on: Some of her friends simply add a half- or fourth-packet, preferring a milder refreshing.  Sounds good to me!  Thanks, Allie ... not only for treating me to dinner but for introducing me to a healthy new taste treat, one that I can mix on the go!<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />author of: Millennium Babe: The Prophecy

review/summary: Great taste, but not worth the $$
review/text: I love most of Crystal Light's flavors, and the new Green Teas are among them.  They taste different from many of the powdered mixes out there - those usually have funny aftertastes, while the Crystal Light versions have a nice hint of fruit and lack the chemical flavor.<br /><br />My complaint is that these "convenient" packets are rather expensive, but some of the flavors are only available in these little guys.  This 6-pack of boxes with 14 packets (each packet makes 16.9 oz, which is 7.4 quarts) costs the same as a 6-pack of those tubes with 5 tubs in them - those tubes make 10 quarts each.  So the packets have 25% less drink mix for the same cost - you pay an extra 25% for the "convenience".<br /><br />Wish the flavors were available in a variety of sizes, or that the packets didn't cost so much more than the tubs.  For now, I'll stick with the flavors I can find in the 2-quart tubs and fill my water bottles with Crystal Light at home.

review/summary: This stuff is REALLY good!
review/text: I am an avid soda and coffee drinker who has decided that it's time to cut down on all the caffeine, but who really hates drinking plain water.  I've always 'tolerated' Crystal Light, but never drank it often because it was very tart and left a really bad aftertaste.<br /><br />Enter this product - I *love* it, and it has prompted me to drink a LOT less soda.  It doesn't have the wicked aftertaste that some of the other non-tea Crystal Light drinks has, and it's far cheaper than soda and a lot 'better' for you.  If you are not a fan of drinking water but know that you should drink more, this is a great product. That it's portable is also huge, as you can get a refillable water bottle (like a Nalgene or similar product) and reuse it.  With all of the packaging and plastic required for bottled water and plastic drink cups, it really does make a difference to just have a tiny disposable packet vs. a whole bottle, both to your cupboards and to the environment.<br /><br />I haven't tried any of the other flavors, but really love the Mango Peach.  Buying it on Amazon and in this quantity is also about half the cost you'd pay in the grocery store, and while I was initially worried about the large quantity of packets, I've had no trouble going through them fairly quickly.

review/text: I've been trying to drink more green tea as a healthier yet still caffeinated alternative to coffee. But, I'm not overly fond of the bitter taste of most green teas - especially when cold. And as the summer months approach I don't want to be slurping on hot tea.  So having read the reviews I bought these as I love fruity cold drinks.  These do have a lovely fruity flavour.  However, I can see that it may be too sweet for those who were still looking for a green tea taste to balance the sweetness. I can barely taste the green tea and it's usually in the aftertaste not while I'm drinking. Even though I like the flavour I think if I drank more than 1 bottle a day it would probably even be too sweet for me.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Methi is Hindi for fenugreek, the seeds of which are used as a spice and the leaves of which are used as an herb. Fenugreek is rarely, if ever, used in Western cooking, but is common in Indian, African, and Middle Eastern cuisine. Fenugreek leaves give this dish a distinct and delicious aroma and flavor. It's rich, hearty, and just hot enough to keep your pallet craving more. One of my new favorite MTR meals.<br /><br />I'm a fan of almost every MTR product I've tried, but this variety was not available in my local grocery, so I bought a whole 10 pack and I'm glad I did, because I don't mind having these in my pantry for a rainy day. And with an expiration date almost two years down the road, I don't have to worry about them going bad or losing quality (not that they'll last that long). And there's nothing to do other than open the package and heat it up, or submerse the foil package in boiling water and eat right out of the pouch. If you can boil water or use a microwave, you have food! Great for camping, too.<br /><br />You can't beat the price, either. They come out to slightly less than my local store sells them for (which was already a great deal). If you love Indian food and love convenience, give these a try.

review/text: The alu methi is really good. It's pretty hot, and my SO loves the spice level; it's about 20 percent too hot for me, so I like it with lots of basmati rice, chutney, raita and naan. I like all the MTR foods that we've tried, with the exception of the pongal. (It's just too bland and rather a strange consistency.) We really like the palak paneer and the bisibele bath, and it's nice to have two or three of them with rice for a very complete meal.

review/summary: Not very Pad Thai-ish but still tasty, and better than most rameny things like this
review/text: Got these just for those times when total laziness overtakes the hungry man. Doesn't taste much like PT but does taste good, especially with a pinch of cayenne added. Recently in our month of 100-degree days (nice "Spring"!), I've been making this, then putting it into the freezer for 20 minutes or so. Nice cold noodle soup!<br /><br />The key to all of these add boiling water things is to use your own china cup/mug, and then cover it with a plate for ten minutes. Makes everything taste muuuch better than wax paper, count on it! And make sure to mix it very well at the start, then cover.<br /><br />I would like to see more organic ingredients in this, but all in all, a very handy and quick snack with some nutritional value, and no animules harmed in the making thereof. Our dog likes that...but then she thinks all animals deserve respect and love. Crazy creature, right?

review/text: I was underwhelmed by this soup. I purchased it based on reviews I had read in the book "21-Day Weight Loss," with hopes that it would be a tasty and quick vegan lunch on days when my time is limited. I found it to be very salty and not tasty whatsoever. I forced myself to eat about half of one of the cups and threw the rest away. Now I'm left with five more cups that I will most likely be donating somewhere. It's possible that Pad Thai is the only gross one of Dr. McDougal's soups, but I don't think I will be taking my chances with any of the other flavors offered.

You'll get better flavor and a more filling meal with the cheapest imitation ramen noodle product.

review/text: This is a nice quick and easy soup. There is a lot of good thai flavor (i.e. you get a yummy cilantro taste). Some people might not like the 580mg sodium in the whole cup, but I don't expect miracles with convenience food. It is quite filling and the noodles, even though they are rice noodles, do not get clumpy or sticky like this type tends to do. Very easy to pop in my purse and take to work. I make it just like the package directions say, add a touch more water after it is done soaking a few minutes and it comes out perfect.<br />I took a star away because I feel that there is only one decent lunch sized serving instead of two that the package claims. I don't like when manufacturers do that. The way this soup is packaged, it seems obvious to me that you will make it and eat it in one sitting.

review/text: I'm not sure what part of this is supposed to be pad thai - the noodles are short and chewy and the flavor pack tastes mainly of salt. I know this is an instant product but I was expecting something that was vaguely close to Pad Thai rather than a bowl of hot water without much flavor. Although this is tagged as vegan, I suspect it's not very healthy since I felt like drinking a gallon of water after eating this.

Well, if you've eaten pad thai in many different places you realize that there are lots of ways your typical restaurant pad thai will taste.  If you're lucky enough to live on the west coast, it'll be much better than your pad thai in the midwest, generally speaking.  Therefore this soup does resemble some pad thai's I have eaten, but it's not sweet, just mildly spicy.  Delicious!

review/text: I cannot recommend Dr. McDougall's Pad Thai Noodle Soup. If it doesn't look like pad thai or taste like pad thai, it's probably a good idea to call it something besides pad thai. A few broken rice noodles in the bottom of a cup of dehydrated broth does not a pad thai make.<br /><br />I had this for lunch today, and the other kids pointed and laughed at me. Thai people walked past my table, frowning and shaking their heads. Soup technicians from the Department of Soup issued my lunch a cease-and-desist order. President Obama stopped by my table, gave me a stern look, and said, "Mark, I thought we had made more progress than this. Forget the debt ceiling. We need to do something about this concoction, which is neither pad thai, nor soup, but an unsatisfying amalgamation of the two."

review/text: I love Pad Thai.  I order it frequently at Thai restaurants, I buy a frozen version at Trader Joe's, and I have bought make-at-home boxed mixes.  I love them all.  I was really excited to see a shelf stable version I could take to work and have for a quick lunch on a busy day.  I've had other Dr. McDougall's soups before and thought most of them were fine, but I was very disappointed by this one.  That there was too much sauce is excusable because it is, after all, called a soup.  That the noodles weren't right is excusable because you are reconstituting them in a few minutes by adding boiling water.  But the flavor is NOT AT ALL like Pad Thai, and for the life of me I can't figure out why they hung that label on this product.  Pad Thai should be slightly sweet with maybe a hint of peanut.  This tastes like the same salty faux meat flavors found in several of their other soups plus a slight sour taste.  This isn't inedible - but if you were expecting anything resembling Pad Thai you will be disappointed.

I am stunned that something that's healthy and vegan can taste this good.  It's also very filling.<br /><br />It's easy to make: open the lid, then open the spice packet inside and pour that over the noodles, pour in boiling water to top, stir.

review/summary: Contains MSG!! (free glutamic acid)
review/text: I thought this was supposed to be the "healthy" soup option, but it's just come to my attention when shopping for some other soup brands that the ingredient "natural flavors" this soup contains, is a cover word for the main ingredient in MSG which is responsible for causing unhealthy effects: free glutamic acid. The food industry uses words like these because they don't want you to know the truth about the unhealthy ingredients in the food, as they would get less buyers. I know I wouldn't have bought this if I knew. This is where I read about it:  [...]<br />(Get rid of the spaces to paste in browser)<br /><br />Besides this, I really think it is a delicious and comforting flavor, which is why I have bought this many times... it is too bad I can't conscientiously get it again knowing about this "natural flavors" labeling scam.<br /><br />However it is fair to say that this is sort of the lesser evil as far as instant soups go. For example the other gluten free soup I was thinking of getting was Thai Kitchen Curry Rice Noodle soup:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Thai-Kitchen-Bangkok-Instant-1-60-Ounce/dp/B000GZSI7G/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_img_1<br />and it had FOUR glutamic acid ingredients (Natural Flavor, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, disodium inosinate, and disodium guanylate). This is why I give this one 4 stars. The point is that we should not fool ourselves into thinking this product is healthy. It should definitely be avoided!

review/summary: A Great Side Dish
review/text: This stuff is really good and does taste authentic. ( I've been to Thailand )<br />It's very easy to make but I have found it's better to let is stand after heating for a few minutes longer then the directions tell ya to. I usually let it sit for about fifteen minutes before eating. This goes really well with a sandwich.<br /><br />Enjoy

review/summary: A lot of promise, no delivery
review/text: I decided to try the Pad Thai since I'd tasted some of the other flavors. It wasn't good. The noodles were fine, but the broth was gritty and definitely not up to snuff. The fresh flavor advertised is not so fresh and definitely not flavorful. I'd give this one a pass until they change the recipe.

review/summary: Soups hit the spot especially when you are in a hurry...
review/text: These soups are so convenient to cook especially when you are in a hurry.  The flavor packet is delicious, the noodles warm up to a nice soft texture; not soggy at all.

review/summary: Very tasty and more healthy choice
review/text: I am not a thai expert, but I have had Thai food before.  While this is not what you would get in an authentic Thai restaurant, it certainly is very, very good.  My noodles were not all broken into little pieces, and to be honest, if you are eating this on the go, who wants long noodles and a messy meal?  This is fresh tasting, not laden down with MSG.  I would not consider it overly spicy.  My 8 yr old daughter ate it and said it was just a little bit spicy.  It's a very tasty and healthy option for a quick meal.

review/summary: It's good for what it is
review/text: Not sure how some people here are expecting gourmet out of a soup in a cup. It's made out of rice noodles and meant to be fairly healthy. It is quick and decent tasting snack or meal for the workplace. If you have a coffee Bunn machine in the office, you can just get some water from the spigot and let it sit for 5 mins.<br /><br />It's not spicy but something in it definitely makes me sweat a bit every time I eat it.<br /><br />Ignore the negative reviews. Some people obviously don't get that this is meant to be healthy and MSG free. People will complain about everything. If you want a gourmet soup, don't buy soup in a cup. That's ridiculous.

review/summary: Good
review/text: No cup-o-noodles is going to be a nutritional powerhouse, but this one is good for what it is.  It tastes good, has some protein and fiber, not bad on sodium, and is 200 calories.  It's not like pad thai from a good takeout place, but it's also far better both in flavor and nutrition than the average noodle cup and the price here is reasonable.

review/summary: Inferior to other flavors
review/text: It stinks having to adhere to a gluten-free diet.  Granted, a good majority of companies these days are selling an amazingly delicious and varied selection of gluten-free foods.  It is still difficult at times to find foods that are not only 'safe' to eat, but also tasty.  I purchased the Pad Thai Noodle Soup cups as well as the Spring Onion Noodle Soup cups from Dr. McDougall's Right Foods about a month ago and brought both flavors of noodle cups to work.  Let's just say that when I open my drawer to grab my lunch for the day, I am let down when I am left with only the Pad Thai flavored cups.  The flavor isn't repulsive or anything, it is just 'okay'.  It doesn't help that I am always comparing and contrasting the two flavors, as if it were to stand on its own, the Pad Thai flavor wouldn't receive super low marks.  Overall, I would suggest that individuals looking for a delicious and filling gluten-free meal purchase the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017U08SQ">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Spring Onion Noodle Soup, 1.9-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a>.  It is around the same price, and tastes absolutely heavenly.  I admittedly still feel badly for being harsh on a gluten-free product... at least items such as these are accessible and reasonably priced for those suffering from gluten-related ailments.

review/summary: Pad Thai Flavor Alright
review/text: I cooked this soup according to the package directions and the Pad Thai noodles were still very undercooked.  I added 3 minutes to the cooking time, and the noodles were better.  The taste of the soup is alright, but nothing too great.  It has some sort of unidentifiable cubes on top (maybe tofu?), about half a cup of noodles, some carrots, and a few pieces of corn.  Overall, I wish there were a few more ingredients or maybe a little more noodles.  I also would have preferred it to be slightly spicier.  So far, I prefer the tortilla flavor of Dr. McDougall's.
