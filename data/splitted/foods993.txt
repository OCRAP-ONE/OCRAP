review/summary: My all-time favorite bagel-chips.
review/text: I've tried a few varieties of Bagel chips, and by far, this is my favorite.  Most bagel chips use mini-bagels, cut horizontally.  You can tell because of the hole in the center.  Bagels are typically seasoned on the outside, sliced, then baked as chips.  If you get a chip that is close to the exterior of the bagel chances are good that you will get the seasoning (usually too much).  If you get an interior chip you will likely get too little seasoning (if any).  Some brands season the chips after they are cooked as well, which almost guarantees that you'll get far too much seasoning.<br /><br />Stacy's starts with regular, whole bagels; the same high-quality bagels that you will find on a supermarket or baker's sehlf.  Because these are sliced vertically, you get round chips that are all seasoned correctly on the outside ring.  Each chip is round and perfect for dipping or spreading.  I love regular bagels toasted with cream cheese, which is also good with Stacy's bagel chips.  However, these are good enough to warrant more creativity.  Try them with hummus, salsa, melted cheese--use your imagination.<br /><br />Yes, this is the same Stacy's that makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KGW2BY">Stacy's Pita Chips</a>.  All of Stacy's products are very high quality.  If you are a fan of everything bagels, you will love these.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZ2AZ0">Simply Naked Bagel Chips</a> are similar to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KGW2BY">Simply Naked Pita Chips</a>--simple, and delicious with dip. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QZ3XKG">Everything Bagel Chips</a> are standard everything bagels, covered on the outside with seeds, onion, and garlic.  These are my favorite out of all the Stacy's bagel offerings.  If you like a bit of seasoning and don't like all of the extras, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P8FUXA">Toasted Garlic Bagel Chips</a> (I like these, but I miss the extras of the everything chips).

review/summary: Ass Kickin' Popcorn
review/text: There are supposed to be 3 flavors (barbecue, kettle corn, and habanero) of popcorn in each muslin bag.  I ordered this popcorn mainly for the barbecue and habanero flavors, not for the kettle corn that has a salty/sweet flavor.  The reason for the 2 star review is that after opening and popping the entire contents of two of the muslin bags, I found that even though two individual bags were marked as barbecue, it tasted like the kettle corn flavor.  I think the bags were miss-marked and resulted in 4 of 6 individual bags of popcorn being the kettle corn flavor.  ICK!!!  I guess if you like kettle corn popcorn you might like this item, but don't expect to get anything resembling barbecue flavor.<br /><br />I did like the habanero flavor, it was very spicy, seemed fresh and virtually every kernel popped. Since one only gets 6 individual bags of the habanero flavor, this purchase wasn't worth the price to me.

review/summary: Truly Gluten Free Corn Grits
review/text: I have a daughter who is extremely sensitive to gluten.  She describes it as swallowing glass and the damage it does takes weeks to heal.<br /><br />Tired of rice, she began eating Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Oatmeal for breakfassst, only to become ill.  She's since found out that some with gluten sensitivities can also become sensitive to oatmeal.  She was so bummed and asked me what could grain could she eat for breakfast?  Besides rice?<br /><br />Being Southern, I knew she liked grits with her eggs.  And I also suggested that she could make polenta and coat her fish with it when frying.  Also, I suggested she could make corn muffins out of grits.<br /><br />She checked with her local GF chapter and asked about Bob's Red Mill GF Grits.  They are on the 'approved' list, so I bought her some from Amazon.  She is one happy camper.  She has food that she loves and that doesn't make her sick.  Go Bob's!!  :)

review/summary: The choice of fundraiser BBQs everywhere!
review/text: Cornell Chicken marinade was developed more than 50 years ago at Cornell University to help chicken producers in NY State sell more chicken. The logic seemed to be that making chicken taste more delicious would entice people to eat more of them. Seems like a great idea to me. The professor who developed the recipe approached the task with scientific precision - the instructions he produced include measurements for marinating just a few up through several hundred chickens as well as plans to build your own BBQ pit. Pretty incredible.<br /><br />This is the recipe used by fire departments, political organizations, and schools throughout Central New York for their fundraisers. I didn't know it was called Cornell Chicken until after I graduated from Cornell, but when I saw the label and tried it out at home I knew I'd identified the familiar taste from many, many BBQs growing up. The bottled marinade is available at local grocery stores throughout Central New York, which is where I've bought most of mine.<br /><br />The base is primarily vinegar, oil, poultry seasoning, egg, salt, and pepper. I generally clean up some boneless chicken breasts, place them in a ziplock bag, then pour in enough marinade to fully coat the mean. I generally put it back in the refrigerator for at least a few hours, though I've done as little as an hour on the counter or as much as 24 hours in the refrigerator. The intensity of the flavor varies with time, naturally, but I have not found 24 hours to be over seasoned. If I've marinaded for less time I generally baste the chicken with a little more marinade while its grilling.<br /><br />I love the subtle flavor and the extra bit of moisture retained in the chicken. While its similar to just marinating chicken in Italian dressing, I think the flavor from this sauce is far better.

I have had sugar free products containing Sugar Alcohol in the past, so I did not expect this product to effect me the way that it did.  The taste is great but the side effects are terrible.  About two hours after eating the recommended serving size I began having severe stomach cramps, as if I had taken a laxative.  Not too long after the cramps began I had to literally run to the restroom.  I thought that one trip to the restroom would have sufficed and proceeded to go to the gym...BIG MISTAKE!!!  Let's just say I had several trips to the restroom following my (what I thought was) a harmless snack.  This product is really not worth trying to satisfy your sweet tooth.

review/summary: Major gas problems after eating
review/text: We love the strawberry Twizzlers and buy them quite a lot.  I was so excited to see the sugar free ones at Walmart.  We bought it and they tasted pretty good (were expensive though).  A short time later we started with gas and running to the bathroom.  It's been 24 hours now and we're still having the gas and believe me it's major gas...you sure don't want to be away from home.<br /><br />I would not recommend this candy to anyone.

review/summary: Great if your about to have a Colonoscopy the next day!
review/text: Ordered this item as I am a diabetic.  Decent tasting but absolutely indigestible. Caused major gastrointestinal distress.  Found hidden behind the fold a very subtle understated advisory that some individuals may experience a "laxative" effect.  Excuse me but this was way beyond "laxative" and lasted more than 18 hours!  This could replace the pre-colonoscopy medicine Miralax. Wait I might be on to something here! At least the the pre-op procedure would taste good.  I subsequently went back to the site and looked at the customer reviews and learned I am not alone in this experience.  Amazon needs to clearly advise customers of this potential in their product description.  Until they do I would hope they refund people who buy it  If you decide to try it after reading this, have a book and a roll handy and don't leave home.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I have made the mistake of eating too much of a sugar free product a few times. It is probably one of the worst feelings you will ever experience. I bought these at the store and was skeptical about these because I LOVE twizzlers. These are a great sugar free alternative. They are not as chewy and don't have as much flavor but you still get the original twizzler satisfaction. I ate about 5 of them and had no gastrointestinal problems at all. I know a lot of people complained about gas and such but just don't eat an entire bag at once and you should be fine.

review/summary: Be Careful Here
review/text: These have a good smell and a not so great flavor, at first. They are oddly addictive. I am use to Maltitol and its effects on the digestive track. These I must say, caught me a bit off guard. My 16 year old daughter ate almost a pack and she was ill for 2 days. (Im sure she wont appreciate me sharing this)She had severe stomach cramps and unstoppable diarrhea. I did not have any terribly bad symptoms. But I did have a bit of bloating.<br /><br />My other concern with this product is that the net carbs in one serving (6 pieces) is 11 grams. That is extremely high especially if you are diabetic or following a low-carb diet. Reference point: 1/2 of a Hershey bar is 10.5 net carbs. I think I would prefer the Hershey bar.

review/summary: Buyer beware of horrible laxative effect. Do not feed to your kids.
review/text: I was happy to find these in my local weis supermarket as I had never seen a sugar free option for the twizzlers and they are my favorite snack. I am very strict about eating the indicated serving size. I loved the taste, noticed no difference between these and the regular strawberry twizzlers made with sugar. One hour later I regretted eating these as I got horrible rumblings in my intestines and spent a few hours going to the bathroom with very bad diarrhea. This was like taking pure laxatives. Do not get this as it is not good for your health. You're better off getting the ones with sugar and just eating half the serving size of you want twizzlers.

review/text: This item is very similar to the regular version. You will need to limit yourself to 3-6 pieces; this will keep you from having the gas pains. This candy had very little affect on my blood sugar. Buying the 12 pack and signing up for automatic 6 month delivery, made the price just about as cheap as Walmart. I don't live near a Walmart and this item is always hard to find, so I was glad to find this deal. My shipment was fresh.

review/summary: Awful, just awful
review/text: I tried this stuff and I don't recommend it at all. I ate three or four pieces and a few hours later it started. The gurgling, the gas then the flow of diarrhea. It lasted a few days and before it subsided, I ended up in the ER with an IV and abdominal pain so bad I couldn't sleep. I received an ultrasound and a CT scan to see what was going on. A month later, I'm still dealing with pain and looking at more intrusive tests to figure out exactly what this stuff did to me.<br />IMO, candy should not need a warning label that includes the risk of hospitalization.<br /><br />Please stay away from anything containing the Maltitol and Sorbitol sugar substitutes.

review/summary: Turned kitty into a vegetarian!
review/text: Our cat loves this grass!  As soon as we put it down for her, she goes right to it and starts munching away.  In fact, she likes the grass so much, the first time we let her eat it, we had to take the pot away before she ate all of it in one sitting (since then, she has started to show some restraint).<br /><br />We've also found that she doesn't beg for food as much if we let her eat some grass; she has even skipped meals after eating it. If weight control is an issue for your cat, this might be a substitute for food when kitty is begging.<br /><br />I was worried that it might upset her stomach but it's been several days and she hasn't had any adverse reactions.<br /><br />The seeds were very easy to grow. They sprouted within just a few days and grow very quickly.  We were a little stingy with how many seeds we planted, so the grass is a little sparse; next time we will plant more seeds.

review/summary: Can't beat this for convenience if you have teens
review/text: I'm embarrassed a bit by how much of this we use since pizza sauce is so easy to make. I have some pretty serious back issues though and can't always cook for my family the way I'd like to.<br />This is just a wonderful thing if you have kids. My children are teens now, and they use this in ramen, omelets, sandwiches and burgers. It's a bit high sodium, but for lunches on weekends I don't mind it. The flavor is not sweet like some pizza and spaghetti sauces can be and the herbs they use to season it work very well. It's an absolutely consistent product.<br />If you're worried about the sodium, after the bottle is partly empty, pour in some plain tomato sauce and shake it up well.<br />My daughter's favorite omelets are made with this, pepperoni, mozzarella cheese and tomatoes. My son loves the same thing but adds mushrooms to his.

review/summary: The Right Product For Fussy Puppies
review/text: I purchased Purina One after a recommendation from my Vet. My 15 week old miniature longhaired dachshund was not eating enough and she suggested I switch her food from The Purina Puppy Chow that the breeder had been feeding her to Purina One because it is a better formula. She advised that I make a gradual switch by mixing in some of the Purina One with the Purina Puppy Chow because puppy's digestive systems are sensitive. My dog immediately liked Purina One and I haven't had a problem with getting her to eat since.

review/summary: Ingredient to avoid, Animal Digest!
review/text: I recently bought a 7-week-old collie puppy for my granddaughter. Joy, the puppy was taken from her mother at 2 weeks along with 9 siblings because the mother was not producing enough milk. It was the mother's first litter. The pups were hand fed a formula and were a bit small and frail for their ages though their price was not. At any rate the breeder had them on Pedigree puppy food when we purchased her and though their is nothing wrong with the brand I wanted something better for her due to her early weaning. Our 2-year-old Labradoodle is fed "Castor & Pollux" which really improved her coat and stamina etc. when we switched from another brand so I bought Puppy food in the same brand. However our Vet told us that she was unfamiliar with the brand, and that she wouldn't feed it to her. Instead she recommended "Purina One Smart Blend Puppy Formula". I of course ordered a bag and stated mixing it with the Pedigree to switch Joy over slowly so as not to upset her digestive system. She has now had Diarrhea for 4 days, her stool sample shows no abnormalities and after taking her to the vet she is being treated with medicine. On reading the list of ingredients on the bag of Purina I saw it contained something called "ANIMAL DIGEST". I thought "what in the world could that be?" On searching the Internet low and behold I discovered this web site.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />which the following came from<br /><br />"Since the pet food recalls I'd like to believe we've all grown a little more aware of what we're feeding our beloved pets. In this blog I'd like to call your attention to an ingredient that is so common in many lower quality foods and dog treats. Animal Digest is often included in many commercial treats and bottom of the barrel dog foods. Be prepared to be grossed out when I explain to you what this product really is! According to AAFCO (The term AAFCO stands for the Association of American Feed Control Officials; they provide regulatory guidelines for the manufacturing of pet foods) standards, Animal Digest is<br /><br />"Animal Digest - material which results from chemical and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of clean and un-decomposed animal tissue. The animal tissues used shall be exclusive of hair, horns, teeth, hooves and feathers, except in such trace amounts as might occur unavoidably in good factory practice and shall be suitable for animal feed."<br /><br />Yuck!<br /><br />Another expert has described Animal Digest as "a cooked-down broth which can be made from unspecified parts of unspecified animals." The animals can be collected from almost any source. There is no control set in place over quality or contamination. Any kind of animal can be included: "4-D animals" (dead, diseased, disabled, or dying before slaughter), goats, pigs, sheep, horses, rats, euthanized at animal shelters, restaurant and supermarket waste, road kill, etc.<br />That is about as gross as it gets.<br /><br />Please read your bags carefully and choose treats with ingredients that you can pronounce and understand."<br /><br />After reading this I tossed the Purina in the trash and opened the bag of Castor & Pollux. Once again an intelligent, Professional, trained person just accepted the word of an authoritative institution i.e. the "AAFCO" as FACT and has no doubt along with untold numbers of others in her profession recommended it to her clients to put in their pets bodies.<br /><br />This is perhaps the microcosm to the macrocosm that is today's America. We-the-People have just taken the word of all our institutions and so called leaders unquestioningly. Look where it has gotten us! I may not be able to change that unfortunate fact of human nature but I can change Joy's nutritional intake and have despite the increased cost. Sometimes you do get what you pay for. I highly recommend Amazon.com but do your dogs a favor and buy the Castor & Pollux for them or some other quality brand instead of one containing "Animal Digest"

review/summary: Does wonders for Puppy!
review/text: I recently got myself a husky puppy and I had her on Pedigree puppy food and she didn't like it at all, she just sniffed it and left it alone. I was worried because she had two vet appointments and between those two appointments (one month apart) she only gained 5 pounds.<br /><br />Seeing as how she only gained 5 pounds, I decided to switch her dog food. After looking at all the puppy food at my local grocery store, i bought a bag of this food. As soon as i opened the bag when i got home, she jumped on me to get to the food. She really loves it, and never turns it down. This is great because now i don't need to buy treats to train her, i use the dog food! So far she has learned how to stay, lie down, speak and currently learning how to roll over.<br /><br />At her next appointment (again, a month apart) my puppy doubled in weight! She gained 16 pounds and this food has also improved her coat. It's soft and really shiny. This food also cut back on her constant chewing, I'm guessing the hard kibbles and the soft pieces of meat calmed her itching gums.<br /><br />This food is great, if you're hesitant to buy the food, get a small bag and try it out. This will help your puppy's growth and give them a shiny coat that people envy, I've had numerous people ask me what i feed her and they all can't believe that her coat is so shiny and soft especially since she is blowing out her fluffier and thicker winter coat.<br /><br />Pick this puppy food, your pet will thank you

review/text: Chocolate Metromint water is our favorite.  I actually prefer it to not be refrigerated, which means it is a winner in lunches.  I don't have to worry about keeping it refrigerated.  The taste is light - just a hint of chocolate and mint.  Unlike some mint beverages, the mint is not overwhelming, but refreshes!  It has a natural flavoring and doesn't require sugar to bolster the flavor.  It's healthier than soda.  I can't think of a better way to get my daily water requirement. The only problem I have with it is that I can't keep enough of it in the house!

review/text: I LOVE this brand of gluten free products. They have some fantastic items and, although this product has a wonderful taste and crunch--the crunch is it's downfall. I had a case delivered to my home and every package was broken. Not one stick made it. It was more like croutons. Too bad. I was really needing bread "sticks" for my diet and due to the broken pieces, it made it difficult to calculate calorie intake. Won't buy this product online again.
