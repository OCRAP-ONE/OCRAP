review/summary: Amazingly light & Delicately sweet
review/text: The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.com for about $1.40 per box, I was so exstatic!  I could eat an entire box without feeling full of sugar or guilt.  Perfect with tea as I am not a coffee fan.  There are several reviews that I have read that were complaining about the number of boxes they received (12)- it says right in the product title how many boxes come in the order!  Do people really not read anymore then turn around and have the gall to give a bad review just because out of pure stupidity they failed to read what they were actually ordering?  I am appaled by some people's idiocy until I remind myself that I live in the United States.  Besides, why would anyone complain at $1.40 per box?  I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone, I would give 10 stars if I could.  Oh, and be glad they come in shipments of 12 boxes, they will be gone before you know it!  Thank you, Amazon!

review/summary: The Best Cookies!
review/text: My husband and I have been buying these cookies locally for years because we love them so much; they are far better than the milk chocolate version (but then, we love DARK chocolate!). In the past couple of years, our local grocer has stopped carrying them, we would request them, they would get them for a few months, and then they would stop carrying them again. I am so glad to see that I can get them via amazon.com! These are wonderful cookies with warm milk, cold milk, or a little Scotch . . . mmmmmmm!

The whole wheat version of these are particularly superb with a subtly greater flavor than the original and a lovely, slightly more crumbly and grainy texture. It has been a wonderful discovery.

review/summary: Great cookies--don't buy in the summer
review/text: These are positively the most delicious cookies ever--smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.  However, when we received them--albeit in the Texas summer--they were fused together in the packaging. They are now not only less attractive, but also hard to eat.  So I would not recommend ordering these in the summer with the way they are packaged by Amazon.

review/summary: YUM- like a perfect Rice Crispy
review/text: If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!

review/summary: Great- and good Sell By date
review/text: I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once.

review/text: This very crispy sugar wafer is perfect with ice cream, or with coffee or tea.  It's got a lovely burnt marshmallow flavor.  I really like these- they seem to harmonize with anything.  I'm allergic to GMo cornstarch, so it is hard for me to find cookies I can eat.  This one is lovely, and it's safe for me to eat.

review/summary: Absolutely Wonderful!
review/text: These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast. Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children.

review/text: If you've had these cookies already - no one needs to sell them to you. I would just recommend that you keep them in the freezer. That way they're sort of hidden from you (and others) but for some reason freezing them brings out the taste and consistency of the chocolate. Try it!

review/text: I don't know what Bahlsen was thinking over the last several months, but I looked high and low for these cookies in supermarkets and specialty stores...none were to be found. Then, after checking with Amazon (and its tracking mechanisms), Voila! I ordered a whole case and that should satisfy our deep appreciation of these cookies... a perfect blend of high quality dark chocolate and a crisp, thin "chocolate vehicle"--i.e., cookie.

review/summary: Good with coffee
review/text: These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.

I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad.

review/text: EDITED to reflect new order; original order from 2011 was 3/5 stars, this new order gets 5/5.<br />---------------------------<br /><br />New review:<br /><br />I re-ordered these oysters a couple months ago. I'd give that new experience more than the perfection, 5/5 if I could.<br /><br />There were some issues with that newer box that came to me. I reached out to Charleston Seafood about it; the issue was more than resolved to my satisfaction. Oysters were delicious, packed securely, and it was a great time to eat!<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Original review:<br /><br />On a 5 star scale, I figure:<br />1 = terrible<br />2 = not good<br />3 = neutral<br />4 = great<br />5 = amazing<br /><br />If I could, I'd rate my overall experience a 3.5 / 5, but, decided to default down to 3 and not up to 4. Here's why:<br /><br />POSITIVES first. Ordered on a Thursday, and received Friday, the next day, even though I paid for two day shipping and not overnight. Package was labeled 'Saturday Delivery,' but UPS must have been ahead of schedule. It was great for me to receive one day early but I can't credit that to seller.<br /><br />Oysters were packed very securely in a foam cooler, with a nice, handwritten 'thank you' written on the invoice, with instructions on how to handle / store / prepare miscellaneous shellfish included.<br /><br />Most importantly, most oysters were of a fairly substantial size, ALL oysters were still good and were very fresh and tasty.<br /><br />NEGATIVES second. Oysters were sold by weight and not count. I received 56 pieces; at the current sale price, this comes to $1.16 per oyster, which is about 16 cents more per piece than I would pay if I would buy just one Grade A oyster at my local fish monger, who sells oysters for 99 cents each.  Unfortunately, these oysters are B, C, or even D grade oysters; they are NOT of the visual quality you would receive in a restaurant and are probably a good bit 'uglier' than you would buy at your local fish market. Most are either: barnacle encrusted; have deformed shells; have grown into broken shells of other oysters (a franken-oyster of sorts, which weighs a substantial amount but is still only one edible oyster); etc . . . Further, my package contained a decent number of mismatched broken shells; that is, broken halves that did not have their other broken half in the same box. Lastly, the oysters arrive filthy, much more so than you would find at your local fish market or grocery store.<br /><br />OVERALL IMPRESSIONS. The oysters were delicious, and packaged securely. They were fresh, which is really important. However, they are grade B or below oysters; these sell for MUCH LESS than restaurant quality oysters do (I've seen B grade sell for $20 or less for similar sized bushels). It really perturbs me that I had to pay by weight and a decent amount of weight was taken by broken shells, a decent number of franken-oysters which comprised of maybe 4 full shell halves but only 1 edible oyster, and silt / filth / mud.<br /><br /> However, I do realize a substantial amount of my purchase price went to the 2 day shipping cost. I get that. Ultimately, ordering oysters in this manner is a novelty, much like ordering lobsters by mail from Maine and spending much more than retail. But, here, the premium for getting them delivered to your door is not too high; chances are you won't be able to purchase B grade oysters near you, so you won't be able to take advantage of their much lower price point.<br /><br />For the cost, I will probably purchase these again; it was enjoyable to receive and prepare these oysters, and all were fresh, which is of the utmost importance.

As a big fan of oysters I was looking forward to trying a different variety then the ones we get in the west.  I found them tasty and well worth the purchase.  Sizes shipped were consistent and no disappointment.  Will purchase again.

review/text: Oysters came quickly (to Kansas) and very well packed. I ate several raw and did notice a little more silt than I would like but overall not bad. There were upwards of 50 nice size oysters with only 2 dead ones when we cooked them 2 days later. Free super saving shipping was unbeatable. Next time I'm ready to relive my childhood of living in florida and having oysters cooked over an open flame, this is my place!

review/summary: I'm in oyster heaven!
review/text: I was recently in Charleston and loved the oysters so decided to order via Amazon. These are not the same type that I had so didn't know what to expect especially with the little info you get via the product description but am very happy!<br />Got order in less than 2 days very well packed with tons of ice packs. Took me longer to open the carton than it did to shuck an oyster and enjoy it. I rec'd 75 huge osters! 1 doa. Some were as big as my hand! You do need to do alot of cleaning. These are fresh out of the ocean as is. Do what I did and buy a good scrubber and a shucking kit. I ate the 1st 2 raw as I had never eaten they raw before and they were very good. I then steamed some and overall very good though of course not as good as going to Charleston and eating them just harvested.<br />You just can't beat the free shipping and when I went to the same seafood website they wanted $125 just for the shipping.<br />So expect a foam cooler filled with yummy oysters and enjoy! I wish the seller would provide more pics, a much better description and some instructions. I would if I were the seller. These are not shucked as stated in the description. They are live intact and well worth it. TY

review/text: This is an exceptional value. The oysters were ordered as an X-mass gift for my father. They arrived on time and in good condition (ice packs frozen). The oysters were not clumped together and were clean.  Yes, there was some silt, but that is to be expected. Those expecting perfectly clean oysters should go to an oyster bar. I asked my father to rate the oysters and he said they were "great".

review/text: Due to the oil spill, we were unable to locate fresh oysters locally.  The oysters were a good value.  They arrived in a very timley manner.  When they say bulk, raw oysters....they mean it!  Although I feel they could have been picked a little better.  It appeared as if they just shoveled them out of the sand and shipped them.  They were definately worth it though.  A few were dead, but that is expected.  The live ones were delicious! and recieved extra, I'm sure to account for the ones to die in transit.  Will definately order again.

review/summary: Do Not Buy These Oysters
review/text: I bought these for my brother last year and he LOVED them and asked for them again this Christmas.  They arrived today and there were no single oysters in the entire box.  There was a big clump that were all grown together and were impossible to try and open most were empty, but some have an oyster on either the one grown to the bottom or to the side - they were impossible to open.  I am beyond disappointed and am humiliated at the gift given my brother.  Last year's batch was wonderful - this year - beyond awful.<br /><br />Definitely won't order and make the mistake again.  Seriously, how do you send people oysters to someone when they are not singularly in the box?  I am so disappointed.  If he hadn't spent hours getting out the few he did, I would have told him to send them back.  So awful!!!!!!!

review/summary: Questionable value
review/text: I purchased this item based on a customer review indicating they received approx. 100 oysters. My 20 pound box contained 56 oysters. At $59.00 and free shipping, 100 oysters is a great deal. At 56 pieces, regardless of size, my per piece cost went out the window and suddenly, this is not a good deal. Suggest you buy oysters on a "count" rather than weight basis. I now realize this is the only time I bought oysters this way. I've bought gulf oysters at 100 count per box and 150 count per box. Locally, I buy Pacific oysters at $.67 per piece. These are from Washington state and Vancouver, B.C.. That is a per piece, retail price. Select and bag yourself at a local fish market. Also, the shipment contained no "Harvest Tag". I believe this is a federal requirement. In the event you become ill, the source of the oysters can be traced. Won't buy again.

review/summary: Awesome for a midwestern family who loves oysters!!!!
review/text: I normally don't write reviews, but we were SO happy with this product and service!  After reading some of the other reviews, I was nervous about what we were going to receive.  However, we were VERY happy with the size and quantity of the oysters and they were extremely delicious!!!  We received 85 oysters and I think only one was "iffy" on whether it was dead or not.  Living in the midwest, we don't have a lot of options for "fresh" oysters, so the price and quick service were perfect for us!!!  Even the cleaning and shucking was kind of fun since it's not something we get to do very often!  We will definitely be ordering again!!!  My only advice is that the company does not ship over the weekend, so I ordered on a Friday night and did not receive until the following Wednesday.  Not a big deal, but not something that I realized until after I ordered!

review/text: These oysters come covered with mud and sand and barnacles but they tasted like I scooped them out of the sea myself.  My husband and I ate 18 each on the night they arrived and two days later I fried up the remainder with some Panko bread crumbs.  They were unbelievably delicious both ways. They are not the pretty little ones you get at restaurants.  They are butt ugly but fresh and tender as can be.  My friends can't believe I buy oysters on Amazon.  Wonderful.

review/summary: Honestly
review/text: They arrived before expected, which was not an inconvenience luckily as I was home to receive the product!<br /><br />I read and re-read all the reviews on here about the oysters and decided to take a chance. I am glad I did!<br /><br />They arrived wonderfully packed with ice packs, of course you have to eat them the same day as soon as possible. I never intended these oysters to be eaten raw half shell. I tried one, and it was not up to par freshness wise (DUH) and they were always intended for the grill. As I was hosing them down in the backyard on my patio with a garden hose and attachment, I thought once again of the complaints people had that they are full of silt.<br /><br />Well, nothing worth doing is ever easy. So I lovingly sprayed each one, giving them a once over, and it gave me the chance to pick out ones that were open and toss the meat into my vegetable garden as fertilizer. Out of the stack, only 4 or 5 were bad overall (from sniff test) If you work for your food, it tastes better. Regardless, the oysters did not arrive any more clumped than at a restaurant, nor were they absolutely covered in silt the way they are just as they are fished out of the Charleston bay. If you are expecting them to be grocery store clean, you by all means pay grocery store price. Some of them had gorgeous shells and the barnacles were shaved off. Thank you so much!<br /><br />Now the sad part, I did find that the oysters lacked any kind of noisette. I didn't overcook them on the roaster, even when I had the two raw, it failed to excite me the way blue point or kumamoto does. They were also cleaned to the point that all saltiness in the brine were non-existent. I had to toss some fleur de sel over each one to bring back some sort of saltiness.<br /><br />There was a point where I was shucking the roasted oysters and was smelling some really ripe ones. I thought there would be a really nasty oyster in there that I had missed, giving out this foul garbage pail odor. It turned out, in fact, to be my 23 month old son, walking past me with a stinky diaper. I had to laugh!!!<br /><br />So as a recap, I would buy from them again when I have another oyster roast, I wouldn't get these for eating raw, I love the prompt delivery, and the product arrived in excellent condition!!!

review/text: These were the dirtiest, filthiest, silt-ridden oysters I have ever bought in my life. Even after scrubbing, it was almost impossible to open the oysters without getting silt inside. So many of the oysters were stuck together, and they were so barnacle encrusted it made shucking VERY difficult. I spoke to the owner Ron before ordering, and since he had been so nice on the phone, I called him to tell him of my experience and he offered to make amends when I told him that I wanted to buy some shucked oysters. But instead of $20 with free shipping, Amazon's price is now $25 plus $22 shipping. Wow!<br /><br />Buy oysters at your local fish market or supermarket where you can pick out your own. I would never buy from this vendor again.

All the flakes were gone (when I shampooed him with regular dog shampoo, the flakes remained).  The shampoo has a fresh smell, not some flowery scent that would seem most unnatural for a dog.  His fur is nice and soft.  I'm pleased with my choice, and I'll be using for as long as my dog needs it.

review/summary: A pleasant hot sauce
review/text: For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Valentina Salsa Picante Mexican Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others.  It has a good flavor and is neither too hot nor too mild.  This is a product that I can recommend.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: I copied this from a post I wrote on my blog a while back. I only changed the price to XX.<br /><br />This has become my preferred hot sauce. I had never heard of the brand before but saw it on the shelf at WalMart maybe a year ago and bought a small bottle to try. I really like it so it is now what I use mostly as hot sauce, several times a day usually. It comes in regular and extra hot. I have tried both and prefer the extra hot, although it is not that hot. It is about right for me. I go through a bottle or 2 a month.<br /><br />Ingredients: Water, Chili Peppers, Vinegar, Salt, Spices, 0.1% sodium benzoate as a preservative.<br /><br />As an added bonus, the 1 liter bottles are &lt;$XX. Made in Mexico. it comes in a smaller bottle as well, but I get the 1 liter size. I have one at work and one at home.

I bought a jar for my husband for Hanukkah (yes, there will be Valentina flavored latkes this year). We cannot find it where we live and are grateful it is on Amazon. The shipping was super fast and the bottle was wrapped very well to prevent breaking. Thank you.

review/summary: Too much vinegar in this variety. The "extra hot" version (look for a black background on the label) is much better
review/text: Warning: there is a significant differences between the regular Valentina reviewed here (a yellow background on the label) and the "extra hot" version (black background on the label).<br /><br />The regular variety of Valentina hot sauce is heavily laden with vinegar. Yet, if you like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce, you might really like this one. It tastes very much like Frank's hot sauce or even the original Tabasco hot sauce (once diluted). Unless you like a heavy dose of vinegar, this variety is Not Recommended. But keep in mind that a lot of vinegar is what many Americans are used to and may actually prefer.<br /><br />The "extra hot" version is much better balanced in my view.  The vinegar is in the background and while this variety is a tiny bit hotter - it is far from being "extra hot".<br /><br />To tell the two versions apart - keep in mind that the regular variety has a light yellow background on the label while the so-called "extra hot" version has a black background on the label. In very small type, on the "extra hot" variety, you will see the words "extra hot" but that is easy to miss. Use the label background to tell the two versions apart.<br /><br />Make no mistake, the two versions of this sauce are worlds apart. The regular version has a heavy vinegar taste and the hotter version, which is not much hotter, is far better balanced in my view. See my review of the "extra hot" variety for more comments.

review/text: These are my favorite type of Jelly Bellies. I had been eyeing this product for some time. After a few glasses of wine, I decided that this was a must buy because its price per pound was much lower than a single pound of this flavor. The price is still pretty high, but it is about the same price as buying 5 single pounds. I have been snacking on these for a few months. They are still around, and I still love them.<br /><br />The product arrived in a cardboard box with the jelly beans directly in the box. No plastic bag or anything, just the shipping box filled with jelly beans. I am not a huge germaphobe, but would have preferred a better container than the shipping box. This was the only reason why I docked it a star.

We switched our two Cattle dog mixes to Hi-Tek from Blue Buffalo after it made our 9-year-old gassy. This food is all natural and made in America (even the packaging is made in the USA) and I can get a huge bag of Hi-Tek for $20 less than other natural brands in the pet store with Amazon's free shipping. When I forgot to order more food and had to get another natural brand at the pet store, my dog turned her nose up at it and waited until we got the Hi-Tek in the mail (the next day) to eat!<br /><br />I don't know what I would've done without Hi-Tek! Natural food on a budget.

review/summary: Drastic cost increases!
review/text: My 4 stars is for the original price!!! I bought a 35# bag of Hi-Tek Naturals Lamb Meal for Less Active and Large Breeds in 10/6/12 for $36.80. Only a week later it is OVER DOUBLE this price ($76.34 on 10/11/12)?? It is a good dog food, but for $36! It is not worth over 75 dollars! I hope they get such a decrease in revenue that they revert to their original price.<br /><br />As for this food itself, I do like Hi-Tek brand and have tried multiple foods. My dog likes all of them fine, and her stools are smaller, less frequent, less smelly. The fat content of this Less active formulation is 12% as opposed to the normal 16% ( Hi-tek chicken meal with sweet potato is my comparison, $47.38 for 30# on 10/6/12, $45.99 for 30# 7/7/2012). However, the protein is decreased from the normal food - this one is 21% and normal food is 32%. I believe this is a reflection in the decrease of the quality of ingredients. The first five ingredients in the Less active formulation are: Lamb meal, pearled barley, white rice, brown rice, whole milo (another grain) followed by pork meal and some vitamins. Seems to me, a smart person would just buy the regular food and add some rice! The first five ingredients of the regular formulation are: Chicken meal, sweet potato, peas, pork meal, egg followed by duck meal, salmon meal, and a bunch of fruits and vitamins.<br /><br />Bottom line: love Hi-tek, kinda upset about the price changes, this food is not worth a penny over the original formulation even though you get 5# more. In this food they just cut protein sources and fruits and added more "filler" like rice.

review/summary: Tastes good, but not like Banana Chocolate Chip
review/text: Having made some banana bread last week, I was expecting this bar to have a similar taste, with a bit of chocolate added.  Wrong!  The box says this includes 1/2 serving of veggies based on the pumpkin it contains, and I would say that there may be more pumpkin taste than banana. The 1/2 serving of fruit comes from apples and bananas, and the apple content seems to exceed the banana as well, since the first ingredient is apple puree.<br /><br />So what DOES it taste like?  I'd say it is a dense, spicey bar with a bit of gingerbread taste going on.  The chocolate is barely detectable.  Once I get over the fact that the name does not fit, the bar is flavorful enough.  Plan to drink something with it, as it feels a bit dry.

review/summary: My new favorite snack bar
review/text: I buy so many different snack bars for my family and never know which one will taste the best, not be so small you need to eat 2, and have the most healthy ingredients without a bunch of processed junk we try to avoid.  I may have just found it!  These bars are big enough, very tasty and filling and are healthy! I plan on trying every flavor.  I can feel good about offering these to my family and knowing they aren't just eating a glorified candy bar.<br /><br />**UPDATE** I now have tried all the flavors of these bars - and now these are the only bars I buy, my kids think they are a little dry - but I love them.  Would recommend for anyone who wants a healthier alternative to the "bars" out there on the market.

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: Well, though some others don't like...I happen to love them.  Apparently I am not the only one, since every store in my area keeps selling out of them the day they re-stock.  Delicious!

review/summary: If you like chocolate & bananas, this is for you!
review/text: I love chocolate. Everyday as a kid my mom call and ask what candy bar I wanted that  day. She would pick it up at the snack shop at work before heading home. My day was not complete without chocolate. Of course, as a kid I played sports, ran around, and had a super high metabolism. Now as an adult i sit at a desk all day and occasionally make it to the gym. But i still love chocolate and in my quest for a healthy eating life style these bars fit in great. I think they taste very good. And they are 3 points plus if you are doing weight watchers.

review/summary: Satisfying Snack
review/text: I haven't done a review in a while, but after seeing multiple 1/5 star reviews I felt compelled to give my objective opinion. First of all, I'll provide some background. I am a large proponent of "all-natural" foods based upon real ingredients, rather than ones sourced directly from a chemical lab. If you are accustomed to eating other natural/healthy snack bars such as Nature's Path, Pure Bar, LaraBar, etc. you will appreciate Kashi's flavor profile. It is not overly sweet. It is also not a glorified candy bar disguised as a healthy snack; there are only 9 grams of sugar per serving. Instead, one is treated to an accurate description of a soft yet chewy bar that has a satisfying baked oat crunch. In addition, flavor notes of real banana are present with an occasional chocolate chip folded in for good measure. Buy a pack from your supermarket on sale, it's a cheap and satisfying snack with coffee or tea. I recently paid $2.99 for a box on sale at Publix (Winter Park, FL).<br /><br />-Joe

review/summary: worst tasting bar i've ever ingested...
review/text: I've tried almost all of kashi brand granola bars and cereal bars so I was excited to give this one a try. It has the most sugar out of all the kashi bars so i thought it must be delicious...WRONG. I couldn't even eat half of this bar...so disgusting. Going to throw the rest of them away or something.

review/summary: Gross
review/text: Blehhhhhhh. I am 100% all for natural and organic food, and I've had some GREAT all natural snack bars, but this is gross. It's really thick and dense, gross flavor of banana, reminds me of really old burnt banana bread only less flavorful and without cinnamon or sugar or anything good. Even the chocolate chips don't save this bar.

review/summary: Banana Chocolate Chip Bars that taste like Fig Newtons
review/text: If you are a person who is used to eating healthy products, and especially Kashi products, you may very much enjoy this snack bar. But if you are looking for a snack bar that tastes like banana and chocolate chips, the name of this variety of snack bar, you may be (like me) quite disappointed.<br /><br />I have had Kashi cereals and energy bars and the past and have enjoyed them (some more than others), so I was shocked when I opened my first "Banana Chocolate Chip Chewy Snack Bar" to find that it had zero banana flavor and not much chocolate flavor either. There ARE chips in it that look like they might be chocolate chips, but even when I plucked one out and ate it by itself, I could just BARELY identify it as tasting chocolate-like (i.e., it tasted like carob or some other fake chocolate, even though "semi sweet chocolate" is indeed in the ingredient list)...and certainly, among the sweet taste of a base that tastes like Fig Newtons, the chips have little chance of standing out.<br /><br />I admire Kashi as a company, but I was truly disappointed and angry to have something marketed as banana chocolate chip that tasted like neither. One part of the marketing that IS correct is that it IS chewy. It has a soft chewy texture and there are some crunchy bits in there that I can't identify. Looking at the ingredient list, it could be oats or another of the "Kashi seven whole grains."<br /><br />The description for this product included the words "Yummy banana bread taste with dark chocolate chips, just like homemade." Uh...NOT! I found the sweetness cloying, likely a result of using evaporated cane sugar, fruit purees (apple and banana), and dried pumpkin as sweeteners vs. sugar. The weirdest thing to me is that it tastes so much like Fig Newtons but has no figs in it (which makes me now want to read the ingredient list for Fig Newtons). For the record, I love Fig Newtons...but not all the time...and not when billed as chocolate.<br /><br />Basic Nutrition Facts PER 40g bar:<br /><br />Calories  140<br />Total Fat  3g<br />Sat Fat  0.5g (no trans fat)<br />Cholesterol 0<br />Sodium  125mg<br />Total Carb  25g (not for you low carbers!)<br />Fiber  4g<br />Sugars  9g<br />Protein  3g<br />Includes small amounts of Vitamin A and the minerals Iron and Calcium. The list of ingredients is about 2 inches long on the side of the box.<br /><br />The box includes 5 1.4 ounce bars and claims that these bars provide 1/2 serving of fruit and 1/2 serving of veggie.  I was only able to eat 1 1/2 bars in order to write this review. I will be giving the rest of the box to a friend. They don't contain enough protein to be effective as a protein bar and are definitely not satisfying enough TO ME to be used as a sweet snack.<br /><br />Not recommended unless you:<br />1. Are already accustomed to the cloying sweetness/aftertaste of evaporated cane sugar or are already eating very healthy;<br />2. Are looking for a healthy snack bar and don't mind the taste;<br />3. Are looking for a snack bar for your kids that is better for them than a candy bar or a high fat snack bar; or<br />4. Don't mind that the product doesn't taste like bananas or chocolate.
