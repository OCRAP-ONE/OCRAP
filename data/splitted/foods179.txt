review/summary: Tasty source of protein
review/text: I didn't order these snack sticks from Amazon, but decided to give my review anyway. I'm required to get 60 grams of protein per day, so I have to be resourceful. I thought I'd try these sticks based on the many positive reviews. At first I was reluctant to eat them because of them being made from ostrich, but I couldn't taste anything different in them. They are delicious! They remind me of Slim Jim's but a lot better. They're not greasy and they're thicker. They are a bit difficult to chew, so be careful about that. Also, they're very filling. I could only eat half a stick at a time. I highly recommend this low-cal, high protein snack.

review/summary: Not too thrilled
review/text: I had some quinoa pasta at a relative's house and loved it. I eat kamut-spelt bread because of allergies. So I thought this combo for pasta would be good, especially since most quinoa seems to come with corn. The pasta is twisted very tight, making it thick, so it takes much longer to boil. I tried it in an alfreda sauce dish and didn't like it. :^( I much prefer spelt noodles or even rice, which are lighter weight. These things are heavy. Maybe if they are used differently? I don't know what to do with them, since Amazon sells them in bulk.

review/text: I had received this as a gift and had never heard of this brand before, but my friends have always had excellent taste, so we gave it a try.  We made most of the batch for a family breakfast on Father's Day.  Everyone raved how good the pancakes were!, where did we get the mix?, what's the name of it?, and so on.  The blueberries in the mix are small blueberries, but they really had a lot of flavor--they weren't little tiny blue flecks like in some mixes.  The flavor was fantastic all around, and everyone really enjoyed them!  I will definitely be getting everyone a few of these for Christmas!

I've never had a problem with him being hurt by the treats. They are dried fish, and dryer than fish jerky is. I'd say the bags that I've gotten are crunchy, about as crunchy as dry food. Again though, I haven't had any problems with my cat hurting his mouth or tongue on them, he chews them right up and begs for more. I must say though that the herring steaks are his favorite.

review/summary: Good Enough to Make Me Order More!
review/text: Finally! A delicious coffee has been created that doesn't send my stomach for a ride on the acid roller coaster. I am able to enjoy several cups of this wonderfully aromatic coffee without any trouble - a first for me. It was such a hit with me that I ended up ordering the Mocha Java flavor. Not exactly the best Mocha Java ever, but definitely easy on the digestive tract. Add a bit of French Vanilla creamer and you are set! Price-wise, you are definitely paying for good quality coffee so it makes the slightly higher price tag worth it. My order of Whole Bean (2.5lbs) was just over $20.00. (Shipping is free with Prime). It will last you a good while - even if you are a heavy coffee drinker like I am. I wish I would have stayed with the smooth flavor french roast, but you live and learn. Please note - I drink my coffee straight black. I made the Puroast Low Acid Coffee with 1TBS of ground coffee per cup. Yep, I like it strong. My husband has severe acid reflux and was able to enjoy a cup of coffee without any trouble. He didn't try more than one regular cup (about 6ozs) for fear that he would have problems later. Generally coffee causes gas pain, burping, etc. with him so he avoids it.

I've read some of the other reviews and it seems some like the flavor, some don't. Personally, I like coffee a little on the bitter side. I'm not one of these mocha java with whipped cream type of guys. So keep that in mind. You pretty much need to do your own taste test, but to me it tasted like a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: I was really disappointed
review/text: First, I have to confess-I LIKE coffee! However, there are times it simply doesn't like me. That's why I was excited to try the Puroast Low-Acid Coffee-French Roast. Finally, maybe I would find a less-acid-y coffee that tasted like coffee without the side effects. Unfortunately, this one wasnt it. When I set it to brew, I was waiting for that pungent aroma of coffee to waft through the kitchen. I waited. I waited. Finally, a small hint of coffee aroma. OK, so if I couldn't have coffee aroma, I'd settle for coffee flavor. Unfortunately, I was again disappointed. If this were put to the blindfold taste-test, one would be hard-pressed to identify it as coffee. It had an odd, almost chemical taste that wasn't exactly pleasant. I thought it might 'grow' on me-and even forced myself to drink a second cup. It didn't grow on me, sorry to say, although I didn't feel any acid after-effects like I often do with regular coffee. Puroast upheld the low-acid portion of the bargain admirably . . I just wish they'd have upheld the coffee part as well. I wont be buying this as a coffee substitute; I'll either deal with the acid-and have both the taste and smell of coffee-or do without.

I got this for her since she likes dark roasts, but doesn't like the problems associated with them. After two cups, she found that the coffee wasn't bitter and was very smooth for a dark roast. No heartburn at all. The overall flavor wasn't bad, but it wasn't something that she would be drawn to in the future. Might try other flavors though.

review/summary: So-So taste to low acid coffee
review/text: The taste of this brew is somewhere in between low end Folgers and a high end gourmet brew with great flavor.  It's not as bad as cheap, commercial coffee but still has a slight hint of that 7-11/gas station/Folgers like taste.  I noticed a difference in the acid level, it tastes almost lighter, or cleaner which is a big bonus, especially for people with stomach issues (and everyone eating a western diet tends to have high acidity).  But I would not purchase this product again due to the taste.  It wasn't "high end" tasting enough for me, however I am used to drinking organic gourmet coffee.  If you drink commercial, cheaper coffee I think you would be satisfied with this taste and pleased with the low acid element.

review/summary: Tastes like mild everyday coffee
review/text: This coffee tastes pretty good. I find that coffee sometimes hurts my stomach, and this low acid version didn't give me that usual burning feeling after drinking it that I get from my usual brand. I think there is some flavor trade-off; it tastes a little weaker and lacks some character of some bigger name coffees. However I think if coffee bothers you though, this is a really good product.

review/summary: Seems to be less acid, not my favorite taste
review/text: This was good for pre-ground coffee. Being French roast it did have that characteristic stronger flavor. I'm not the biggest fan of that roast to start with, so take that into consideration. If you like it, chances are you'll like this product. My biggest attraction was the low acid. I couldn't tell for sure as it only made a couple of cups but I didn't have any excess acid reaction to the coffee. Not that I usually do, but occasionally I can experience some symptoms. None in this case. Not really a scientific study, but it is what it is. Very conveniently packaged. Try it.

review/summary: Low Acid, Low Taste
review/text: I got this as a gift for my girlfriend's mother who had mentioned getting heart burn from coffee - even though she loves coffee.  I thought this might make a reasonable fix to the situation.  After trying though she seemed to be a little less worried with the heart burn and little more concerned with the taste.  She didn't have heartburn, but she also didn't drink very much either - due to taste.  She thought it tasted a little stale and bland.  Maybe it was just a bad batch, but seems the process to limit the acid also limits the flavor.  Too bad, I had hoped this was going to be a big winner.

review/summary: It is definitely coffee
review/text: I was concerned that the beneficial features of this particular brew were going to give it a distinctively different flavor. I was imagining something like a dark tea. This, however, was not the case. I found the flavor to be pleasant. Not as rich as the same flavor from other popular brands, but pleasant.<br /><br />If I were a more serious sufferer of acid reflux, I certainly believe that the small sacrifice in flavor would be worth it. For me, personally, I will probably stick with my regulars.

That being said, I work at a firm where they order Starbucks' French and Breakfast blends, but I order in my own instant NesCafe Clasico. I ordered Puroast's this time, but it tastes the same as the bitter ones, seems a bit acidic for being "Low Acid," and leaves a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />I actually had to mix it in with some creamers (Coffeemate's French and regular). To me, it's as though I were drinking Starbucks' versions, so I see no difference.

review/summary: Not Starbucks but not bad
review/text: Sometimes coffee bothers me being too acidic, this one did seem to bother me less then most. I only had one small sample to try and it's difficult to give a solid opinion on just a 2 cup trial. Right off though It lacked the full body of Starbucks House Blend or Italian Roast that I love but it's still pretty darn good coffee and I liked it better the more I drank it. If you have acid issues this may be worth a try. It is high in caffeine apparently because I felt a bit more wired then usual after drinking it so don't mistake low acid for low octane this still packs a punch! I would like to try this again, it's pretty good stuff.

review/summary: Low Acid-Weak Taste
review/text: I ordered this coffee for my daughter to try. She's a second year med student and has had some Gerd and Lerp problems. Coffee was something that she's always liked but had to give up because of acid reflux. Although the Amazon Vine offer clearly said that they would send ten 3 ounce bags, only one bag was delivered. I emailed back and asked them to send the correct order.  Lo and behold, they once again sent one bag. I contacted them one more time to explain that there must be a coding problem in their system but this time I wasn't favored with a response. In the hundreds of orders that I've processed through Amazon over the years, this is the first time that Amazon has made a shipping mistake and not cleared it up.<br /><br />So both my daughter and I tried a cup. Neither one of us had any acid reaction -- but neither one of us would have ordered it again based on the taste. We both like a stronger and bolder cup of coffee and this one was weak with some sort of strange after-taste. Not exactly our cup of tea. Keep trying though, a lot of people with acid reflux are looking for a great cup of coffee.

Tasted & smelled bitter, flat & slightly weak.<br /><br />Doesn't taste like any French roast I've ever had. Needs more work in the taste area.<br /><br />Comes in a single-use foil pouch for coffee maker or French press.<br /><br />The science may be there & it didn't bother my stomach, but it didn't taste the best either.<br /><br />I'd rather get a great coffee & take an antacid with it to get the great taste. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but like a nice cup of great coffee every once in a while.<br /><br />Might be OK for every-day coffee drinkers that buy regular, bulk coffee brands, but not for me.

review/summary: Not bad if you need a low-acid coffee
review/text: I think Puroast does a pretty good job with low-acid coffee. Low-acid coffee is a very small market and there are very few coffee roasters who are willing to make a low-acid coffee. In Los Angeles, Puroast and Trader Joe's Low Acid French Roast are the only brands I have ever come across in my travels.<br /><br />I gave Puroast four stars because it does not come in whole bean form. I personally prefer fresh-ground coffee and think the pre-ground versions so not stay fresh for as long. I think the flavor, which is pretty good, would be much improved with whole beans. But for those who need a low-acid coffee, and don't mind that it is pre-ground, Puroast is a good choice... especially considering how few choices there are.

I won't say I missed it here, but the flavor didn't wow me, and lactose, alcohol, and smoking all seem to give me the "fiery urp," the acid in coffee not so much. It wasn't bad tasting, mind you, and if you love coffee but get heartburn from high acidity, it's probably worth a shot. Not my cup of tea though!

review/summary: Still Needs Work
review/text: Okay, I'll admit it.... I am a coffee snob.  I have loved coffee since I was old enough to steal a sip from my parents' cup at the breakfast table... and that was too many years ago for me to tell you here.  That said, I will tell you that this coffee is weak and lacks flavor, no matter how strongly it is brewed.  I tried several pots and was not satisfied with even one of them.  I love a dark roasted, full flavored coffee and have tried many French Roasts, which this is 'supposed' to be.  It was dull and flatter than any generic decaf and truly unappealing to me.  I would rather have one cup of 'good' coffee than pots of mediocre brew.<br /><br />This is a coffee that left me feeling as if I had drank a coffee substitute and not even a good one at that.  If you are looking for low acid coffee, try a good Ethiopian or one of the many naturally less acidic coffees out there and pass this one by.  It left me totally lacking in coffee satisfaction.  The aroma was wonderful in the pot, but the taste was of the 'brown water' variety.  It needs work in my opinion.

review/summary: Unimpressive
review/text: While I certainly prefer a fresh-roasted whole-bean coffee, burr-ground, and seasoned before brewing, I am inclined to drink a cup of coffee no matter the source or preparation.  My general preference runs to darker roasts, taken black.  I prepared the Puroast in a Technivorm Moccamaster, though I did back down to a bit less than the full three ounces against 10 cups of filtered water.<br /><br />The result was disappointing.  The brew was strong enough, and certainly presented a low-acidity.  That said, the flavor is fairly flat, with almost a chemical or plastic undertone.  There is no complexity to the brew, where even a run-of-the-mill Folgers offers some flavor signature.<br /><br />For someone who cannot tolerate the acid in a typical cup, it is coffee.  For anyone else, there are better-tasting alternatives for less money.

review/summary: Does the trick for me!
review/text: I just tried this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and from first impressions the coffee is very nice and the low acid nature helps with the sour-y aftertaste that I generally experience when drinking black coffee.<br /><br />I tried the coffee several different ways; black , with cream & sugar, and even with condensed milk.  The coffee was made in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System</a> with the my Solofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Red k-cup filter that allows me to use the coffee of my choice.  In all instances I filled the my k-cup to the brim of the filler pod and gently tapped but not tamping the grounds.  the water temperature is set to the max (which i believe is about 208� F) and made the largest serving available.  This is how I usually drink my coffee in the morning whether in a my k-cup or using the disposable kcups so its the best for me to judge the difference.<br /><br />Even in the largest serving, the coffee is still plenty bold and has great aroma and body.  I generally avoid drinking black coffee because of that acidic aftertaste that I don't particularly like.  That is the reason that I generally use both cream and sugar.  With this low acid blend, I can definitely drink this black if that's what I'm in the mood for.

review/summary: So, I am trying out the coffee on the espresso machine
review/text: I dont have a drip coffee machine so I am putting this into the espresso machine for 2 shots. Tastes about same. I guess it's good for stomach? But don't we use milk to sooth the stomach anyways? cream? and sugar. I guess this means we are going to let go of our sugar and creme that we are so used to from strong coffee taste? Less coffee is answer I suppose. This is great idea for low acid coffee but I just add water on half the amount of regular coffee and add normal amount of creme or sugar and milk and add water to the regular coffee's half portion to make it diluted. That helped so far. You are also supposed to drink this with coffee cake or something to help pass it. Not straight without anything in it unless you love that. I suppose you dont like to put any creme or milk in it then, it would make sense. This didn't make sense to me even while trying it. It just wasn't tasting right for me to drink it without any other sugar and creme I am used to drinking with. So I would say I wouldn't try it again without my condiments. But, I would definitely recommend to my mother who drinks straight black coffee. But she stopped drinking suggesting coffee is bad even weak coffee. She gets these ideas from her friends. She said it was good until last year and she's 60 years old. Now she says all coffee is evil. Dad still drinks black straight coffee from drip coffee machine (they are Koreans as I am). All their friends all drink straight black coffee without milk because they are all lactose intolerant. My younger brother is too. I guess this coffee is for those who has lactose intolerant condition and also loves to drink straight black coffee. Where coffee like this is served? Church. All dad's friends are also going to Roman Catholic Church. That's where it'd be best served. They brew like 5 gallons of these stuff every day. Straight black. Just wasn't for me but it's great idea for my parents who lives 1400 miles away so I couldnt just have them try it.

review/text: This is a really great coffee that doesn't upset my stomach, unlike many robust coffees. The aroma is fantastic and fills the house with that wonderful coffee smell all coffee addicts love first thing in the morning. The flavor is rich, but not over the top or so heavy you have to put a lot of milk to dilute it. My husband loves a really heavy coffee flavor, but I find it overwhelming if it's too thick, so it was nice to have a rich/robust bean that got along with my taste buds. I plan to look for the whole beans in this brand so I can have that lovely thick aroma permeate my kitchen! This particular rich aroma reminded me of my grandmother's house (a fond memory). This low acid coffee is definitely for the coffee drinker who loves a rich, heavy smell but needs something that's easy on the stomach. Perfect blend!

review/summary: Smells stale, tastes weak, looks like tea more than coffee
review/text: The moment I opened the bag I did not smell the wonderful smell of coffee, as I sniffed close to the opening I finally smelled the coffee and it smelled stale.  When I brewed my first cup, the odor still remained stale with the addition of smelling like the second brew from used grounds.  This really affected my reaction and taste to the coffee.  The smell of coffee is appetizing and enhances the taste, but since I already had an issue with the smell, the coffee ended up tasting weak and stale.  The process of removing most of the acid must affect the taste and smell as well as color because it took away the best parts of coffee, the appetizing smell, the rich slight bitter taste, and the dark, smoky caramel color.  I decided to use the rest of the grounds as an odor neutralizer, but even that was not as effective, it did not neutralize other smells like regular acidic coffee.  I guess I will stick to regular coffee, truthfully instant coffee smells and tastes better than this low acid coffee.

review/summary: Hollow
review/text: As someone who suffers from stomach problems exacerbated (if not caused) by drinking far too much coffee, I had high hopes for this product. Unfortunately, during the two days in which Puroast replaced my usual brew, I noticed no significant changes to my physical or mental states nor any respite from my ailments.<br /><br />So it strikes out as a medicine, but how is it as a beverage? The answer is, at best, nothing special.<br /><br />While billed as a "dark French roast", the fine grind of the coffee was more suggestive of espresso, and for best results one should not make espresso in a standard automatic drip coffee pot. The coffee had an acrid aroma and initial taste, which quickly gave way to an empty and hollow flavor, such as one might get when drinking the melted ice from what was once an iced coffee or making instant coffee with cold water. In fairness, my wife liked it more, but she regularly dilutes the coffee that I make... why pay for gourmet when you could just add water?

review/summary: Really nice, delivers on low acid promise
review/text: We got a single pot sample of this coffee and enjoyed it very much. I get heartburn quite frequently and often feel that coffee is one of the causes, so it's nice to have this as an option. The sample was pre0ground and we usually grind to brew, so I look forward trying a whole bean version in the future.

review/summary: Tasty Cup o' Joe
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this item - something that was low acid. I found it flavorful and satisfying. If I hadn't been told it was a low acid coffee, I never would have known. I normally drink Eight o' Clock coffee. I was just as happy with this brand. I would definitely drink it again. I tried having a second cup with breakfast. I also had a cup in the afternoon on another day. Normally I don't drink coffee after breakfast time because of stomach issues. It usually bothers my stomach later in the day. However, I was actually able to tolerate it quite well when I used this type of coffee. I wouldn't drink it daily in the afternoon, but it's nice to know that if I ever need a little burst of energy to get through the day, I can brew a cup of this coffee and not worry about getting an upset stomach. Therefore, I definitely recommend giving this coffee a try.

review/summary: Delightfully Surprising & Smooth
review/text: While I don't normally go for dark roasted coffees, the Puroast Low Acid French Roast coffee was astonishingly appealing. The lack of bitterness and bite actually enhanced the rich nutty flavor. I sampled this product both with cream and without cream and found both methods quite enjoyable. I generally get a stomach cramp within a few moments of drinking coffee, but it was conspicuously absent when drinking this brand. I can only conclude that the low acid is the reason for the change. Additionally the low acid nature of the beverage made it more smooth on the palate.<br /><br />The price of the coffee may deter many coffee drinkers, but for those with a sensitivity to acid and a refined taste for quality coffee the price is worth the added benefits. In comparison, Starbucks French Roast is offered in a 36 ounce package of ground coffee for slightly more than Puroast is offering their 40 ounce package of whole beans.<br /><br />Keep in mind that Puroast also offers a variety of other flavors including half caff and decaf flavors. Additionally Puroast offers a membership program that reduces the price when the consumer agrees to have the product placed on a regular shipping schedule. When drinking coffee is a regular part of your life, auto shipments seem like a good idea and low acid even more so.

review/summary: If I had to.... I would drink this for sure.....
review/text: I received this product from the Amazon Vine Program.<br /><br />I love coffee, but I cannot drink too much and am sensitive to the amount of acid in coffee.  I decided to try Puroast to see what this brand is all about.  I have had low acid coffee in the past but they don't taste good AT ALL!<br /><br />Here is what I like:<br /><br />1) Taste? It doesn't suck.  Its not regular coffee, but if I had to drink it because of health reasons... I could.<br />2) Smell?  Smells just like regular coffee.  And isn't that why we drink coffee too?<br />3) Price.  About the same as what I already pay, no problem there.  Note: I do drink good, pricy coffee.<br /><br />If you have health issues and need to drink low acid coffee, this is pretty good. No, its not regular coffee, but if you are looking to buy a low acid coffee, AND you are looking for a coffee with good taste.  This was good.  I liked it.  Its definitely worth your try!!

review/summary: Tastes great!
review/text: I have suffered from heartburn for years and never thought that it might be due to the coffee I drink so I was very excited to give this a try.  I loved the taste of the coffee and my heartburn might have been a tad bit better, but it wasn't significant.  I guess it is possible that my heartburn is due to something other than the coffee I drink.  I would still recommend this product though because it is very good coffee.

review/summary: Not bad if you have acid issues
review/text: i don't have much in the way of acid issues with coffee, but at times when i'm binge-ing on coffee i sometimes get that burning in my gut.  Is this a better way to feed my addiction?<br /><br />if i'm a pragmatist, it seems like it's easier on my body.  i didn't have any issues drinking this.<br />if i'm in an "i love the smell and taste of coffee mood", this isn't my choice.  the smell of coffee before brewing is less than wonderful.  in fact, i would say it's distasteful.  it didn't make me want to brew a cup.  Nevertheless, I brewed a cup to check it out and was pleasantly surprised by the taste.  it brews a pretty mellow, smooth cup of coffee.  It's not incredibly flavorful, no subtle hints of this or that, but it's many steps above folgers or other cheapie coffees.<br /><br />In sum, it's not as good as premium coffees,but if you miss the taste because of acid issues, this is a good option.

review/summary: Strange Brew Well Received
review/text: While I am not a coffee drinker, I got this for a relative who is.  That relative is a coffee hound and loved it!  The relative went on to describe the coffee as having a "rich, earthy flavor" that was "very exotic" and distinct.  An added advantage is that it is low acid.<br /><br />I smilingly think of Eric Clapton & Cream's classic "Strange Brew" when I think of this coffee.

review/summary: A Decent Alternative!
review/text: I used to have the worst heartburn when I drank coffee. I know how bad it can be when you are craving the brew but don't want heartburn, acid reflux or stomach irritation problems. This Puroast Low Acid Coffee is a wonderful alternative to other the other coffees out there. The taste is smooth and is far from bitter. I would recommend making it just a bit stronger but mainly that's because how I like my coffee. You could also add your own extra flavoring, to each their own. I think it works good as a base coffee. If you are looking to still have a cup of coffee without sacrificing your health give this one a try!

review/summary: sticking with Zantac
review/text: The Vine program sends you a sample of this product that makes one pot of coffee, so perhaps the "low acid" benefits become more apparent with repeat use.  But as Missus 1rude remarked, "I'm sticking with Zantac".<br /><br />The coffee produced by the Puroast grounds somehow managed to be both bitter and flat - for reference, I typically find Starbucks coffees to be bitter and Maxwell House ones to be flat.  If you're a heartburn sufferer and a coffee lover, it might be worth trying the Puroast to see if you find it more palatable than we did.  But it wasn't for us.

I happen to like bold, bitter, and even light coffees - all depending on my mood.<br /><br />Having siad that, this coffee is delicious even for those who don't need the claimed beenfits.  I am drinking it as I type this, and my wife is about to try her first cup.  She's more sensitive to because she has reflux and heartburn.  According to her, she couldn't notice the differences yet.  But she also reported that it was smooth and mellow, and went down very easily.

review/summary: Pretty darned good
review/text: I love full-bodied, dark-roast coffee, but many of the typical low-acid and decaf coffees have a bland, chemical taste to them.  Not the Puroast.  While it doesn't have all the complexities of my favorite beans, it has a full taste with a bit of the tartness I associate with dark roast and none of the chemical taste of other low-acid coffees. If you enjoy coffee but have difficulty with the acid, then you may enjoy the Puroast.

review/summary: If You Really, Really Need the Low Acid, Then This is Pretty Good
review/text: If you are expecting the x-bold, smokey, gourmet flavor of a Starbucks or Seattle's Best, you may be reaching for a miracle that isn't there. I grew up in the 60s with a younger brother who needed to use sacchrine on everything because of his diabetes. Sacchrine is absolutely no sugar substitute. Anyone who has used it knows.<br /><br />The Puroast Low Acid is really not a bad alternative if you need a low acid blend because of acid reflux, sensitive stomachs, etc. Was it weaker than what we're used to? Certainly. Is it bolder than, say, Folgers medium roast. I would say that it is. Though milder than most bold roasts (that's a dead giveaway in opening the pouch. But that is probably because of its finer grind than even the mild and medium roasts with a coarser mill. The finer the grind, the lower the aroma retention. Yet, because it is a finer grind, the taste is much bolder than the smell would give away.<br /><br />This is also a smoother tasting French roast than I was expecting (possibly because of its fine grind), but it was a very pleasant taste.<br /><br />The cost and the flavor may be inconsequential to those who do really need a low acid coffee. For that reason, it was hard for me to rate using the star system because I am a coffee lover without a low acid need. Perhaps someone with a low acid need finds that this coffee is superb and would otherwise give it four or five stars.  If you are a regular coffee drinker, any flavor that isn't cultivated in what you are used to will make others, especially weaker blends seem more inferior than they probably are in reality. When I was in Asia, there were times when I would go weeks without a cup of coffee, and after that, the mildest of blends tasted oh so good to me.<br /><br />Although I was unable to try it in an espresso machine, the finer grind lends itself to espresso; and that may be something you might want to try with this blend to kick the flavor up another bold notch or two.<br /><br />Another possible idea is to use this blend in a French Press (yes, although I know the finer grind isn't typically conducive to the Press; perhaps a filter may be used).<br /><br />If you suffer from acid reflux, sensitive stomach, etc., this may be very worth the try for you.<br /><br />If you don't need the low acid beverage, stick with your standard brands.

review/summary: Pretty good, but nothing special
review/text: Taste in coffee is subjective.  In fact, it's so subjective that it may well be meaningless to discuss it.<br /><br />Nevertheless, my judgement of this coffee is that it's pretty good, but it's really nothing special.  I thought the taste was on the same level as Seattle's Best, Tully's, or Starbucks bagged ground coffee.  It was better than lower-tier bagged ground coffee, but not outstanding.  This is pretty pricey coffee, too.  I can't judge the low acid aspect of the brew, because I generally don't have trouble with acid in coffee.<br /><br />In my admittedly subjective view, this coffee at this price just isn't any better than a three-star buy.

review/summary: OK, but needs to be cheaper!
review/text: My husband loves French Roast and does have trouble with acid after drinking coffee. This would be a great benefit to him but the cost would prevent us from buying it.<br /><br />The flavor was still too strong for me but then I like really light coffees. I tried it first without creamer and didn't like the taste. I added 1/3 cup of water as I usually do for any coffee and some sugar free French Vanilla Creamer. Then it was fine for me.<br /><br />I think we would buy it if it was sold at a cheaper price. Kudos for the company for making low acid coffee though.

This coffee tasted good but not great and it did not have the wonderful smell of good fresh coffee.  But it did not upset my stomach.  The taste was not bad but there was a bit of plastic undertones in there.  It was almost good enough to buy more of but I'm not sure if I will.  I like being able to drink real coffee without regrets but the flavor, it isn't quite good enough.

review/text: ....but on the plus side, no heartburn as I sometimes get when drinking coffee.  I made this 3 ounces (1 packet) to a full pot of water in my 12 cup drip coffeemaker, maybe that was the reason for the weakness. I was expecting it to be stronger since "dark" was in the flavor name. Nice aroma and no bitterness, but unless my heartburn issues get worse in the future, I will stick to my regular mocha/espresso drinks and my CBTL machine.

review/summary: Good... if you need it
review/text: While I like my coffee strong, I am slightly susceptible to acidic coffee - just not enough to have to seek out alternatives. If you are to that point, I would recommend this coffee as a good alternative, but if you are not quite to that point, this is not a substitute for great coffee. It's good enough to compete with the pre-ground mass-market coffees but doesn't match up to the more premium beans. It has a mild, nuttier flavor than I'm used to, and a hint of aftertaste comparable to a diet beverage.<br /><br />What confuses me is that the description claims this is a good choice for decaf drinkers looking for a more robust flavor. I'm not sure I agree with that, but what confuses me is: is this decaf or not? I didn't think so, but this claim makes it vague.<br /><br />20 minute later update: oops, definitely caffeinated... gotta run!

review/text: This is not a bad alternative for sensitive stomachs or for people who are overwhelmed by the acidity of coffee in general, but like the effects.  I wouldn't say that it has a robust taste, so if you're like me and like a good punch of taste first thing in the morning, this is definitely not going to hit the spot.  It advertises a more robust flavor than decaffeinated coffee, but it still doesn't compete in the flavor department with the the bolder flavors now avaialble. Like decaf, it contains a lot of sludge when you hit the bottom of the cup, but it's not strong.  The taste overall is like the weakest coffee blend you could find, so if you enjoy real french roast, this isn't even close.

review/text: At first I thought this coffee would be strong because it's French Roast.  However, it's extremely mild.  It has a nutty aroma when the packet is first opened.  The first sip has a mild nutty flavor, which goes away with each additional sip.<br /><br />I like drinking my coffee black, but can only do so with really good coffee that's not too strong.  Most coffees, I need to add non-fat milk to.  So, I first tried this coffee black.  Although it's very mild, and I didn't need milk to buffer the bitterness, I found it lacking in body.  With the next cup I added hot milk and it tasted much better.  It really needed the extra omph of the milk, even though it was non-fat.<br /><br />I didn't notice any heartburn afterwards, which is good.  But, I wasn't excited to drink it again.

review/summary: Good but lacks a punch
review/text: I had to give up real coffee a few years ago because I have had GERD for the past 10 years that definitely flared up whenever I drank a cup of coffee.  I had to stay away from Dark Roast, Gourmet and even Decaf because of the acidity level in regular coffee.  I missed coffee!  Missed the smell of it, missed the warmth of it and quite frankly nothing else really perked me up better than a cup of old fashioned Joe.  So, when I saw the chance to review Puroast's low acid coffee (French Roast) I was intriqued.  I opened the bag and immediately the yummy french roast aroma wafted up into my nose and filled the room!  Ok...so you had me at first sniff.  Let's see what it takes like before I get excited further.  As I was scooping it into the coffee filter I noticed that the grind is pretty fine.  Almost powdery like.  I found that interesting.  I also was wondering why THEIR coffee was low acid...what was the difference in the overall process?  So, I went to their website and found this:<br /><br />Brew coffee's acid content and bitterness is greatly dependent upon the roast degree, type of roaster, and brewing method. As shown in the table below Puroast� coffee chemistry is unique and different from all of its competitors because Puroast� has a patented slow roasting method known as conduction roasting; which uses renewable fuel and exposes the coffee beans to a lower temperature for a longer period of time. This process is significantly different from the convection roasting method used by other coffee companies that employs a natural gas heated process. This roasting process is also called flash roasting because the coffee beans are exposed to high temperatures for a short time period.<br /><br />These people have done their research!  Check out their website: [...] and see for yourselves.  I was glad to see the process did not include any funky chemicals (like in the decaf process of other coffee manufacturers).<br /><br />I decided to forego my antacid the morning I tried this coffee to see if my GERD would act up.  I even had the nerve to try the coffee black which I never dared before.  It was delicious and I had no symptoms of heartburn or reflux all day.  I tried it the next morning and again drank it black (without any antacid prevention) and I noticed a little bit of heartburn but thought maybe it was because I was trying too much too consistently for my delicate system.  So, I skipped a couple of days and tried again, this time with some skim milk added.  I was fine.  I think the low acid really is helpful but I don't know if people who have really severe heartburn or GERD can drink it daily but it is nice to know that I can keep it in the house and enjoy a cup of coffee with company now and then.

review/summary: Rich Taste, Weak Aroma
review/text: Using a coffee scoop to measure, one 3 oz. packet brewed an 8 cup pot of coffee.  One thing I noticed immediately, while measuring, was the lack of strong aroma. (You know, that lovely smell that wafts up from good strong coffee.)<br /><br />I stuck my nose into the packet, and over the pot when it finished brewing, and still, not much aroma. Same thing in the cup I poured. (Taken with one sugar, a little half-and-half.)<br /><br />So I was pleasantly surprised that my first cup had a nice, rich flavor. It was very smooth, with no bitterness. But...there was an unusual sort of "aftertaste", that I really couldn't identify.  So I waited about fifteen minutes, and fixed my second cup. The rich taste had faded some by this time, but that aftertaste was still there.<br /><br />I think if this coffee is brewed and consumed quickly, the taste is rich enough to be satisfying, and the aftertaste may not be something everyone notices.  However, the quick fade of flavor, and the lack of aroma equals four stars.

review/summary: Based upon my wife's feedback
review/text: I am giving this 5 stars based upon my wife's feedback (I would have given it 4 stars on my own). I am not a huge fan of French Roast (dark seems redundant based upon my experience with other French Roasts &lt;g>). I do like dark roasts, but French Roast tends to be a little too strong for my tastes, however, my wife loved the flavor.<br /><br />The selling point seems to be the low acid, I cannot say one way or the other as to the effect on heartburn, even though I do occasionally get heartburn, it usually isn't associated with coffee drinking coffee, so the fact that I did not experience it after drinking 2-3 cups of this coffee is not conclusive regarding lower acid.<br /><br />Bottom line, for those that love a really rich, strong flavored coffee that may or may not reduce you incidence of heartburn associated with coffee drinking, this seems like a possible choice, certainly worth a try if you have actually stopped drinking coffee due to heartburn.

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: I can't drink coffee, because I have painful bladder syndrome so I was rather excited to be offered this reduced acid version.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the scent. Perhaps because I haven't drunk any coffee in years, I was pleased by the scent. It smelled like the coffee I remembered and had a pleasing scent. Brewing was easy. I just brewed it through a strainer, added hot water and voila!<br /><br />My first taste, did not necessarily excite me. It *did* have a slight Folgers coffee kind of taste. However, my second and third tastes made me realize how much I liked the stuff. Now I'm hooked. It does taste enough like the real stuff to make me want to buy more.<br /><br />I can give this coffee product, two thumbs up, but if you are an IC suffer, you might try the decaf blend. This blend still is caffeine and might upset your bladder.

review/summary: Best low acid coffee
review/text: As I have gotten older my tolerance for acid seems to be lessening. Sometimes I just can't tolerate coffee, but I love it, and the darker the better.  I tried other brands of low acid coffee but found them weak and tasteless.  This Puroast coffee is the best! Very smooth, with a great deep flavor.  Worked well in my Keurig also.  Absolutely no bitterness and no acidic issues. I recommend trying it if you are having issues.<br /><br />I will be buying this again.

review/summary: Low acid, low flavor
review/text: I'm such a coffee snob that I source from specific farmers in Ethiopia. I say this so that people will understand I don't drink grocery store coffee.<br /><br />This Puroast low acid stuff? Flavorless. No body. No "coffee-ness" to it. It tasted like vaguely coffee-flavored water. It's caffeinated, so it's got that going for it. I'd rather take 50 Tums and drink good coffee though.

review/summary: Solution in Search of a Problem
review/text: unless you have heartburn, acid reflux, or mild stomach irritation that is directly attributable to coffee.  I have heartburn and acid reflux, currently treated by OTC acid reducers, and while I've found that certain foods and beverages seem to increase my symptoms, coffee doesn't appear to be one of them, especially since I experience my worst symptoms at night but only drink coffee in the morning (for the caffeine).  (Perhaps this product would make more sense in the decaffeinated version: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JQXB66">Puroast Low Acid Coffee Natural Decaf Dark French Roast Grind Drip Grind, 0.75-Pound Bags (Pack of 2)</a> or the half decaffeinated version: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JQR7FM">Puroast Low Acid Coffee Half Caff Dark French Roast Grind Drip Grind, 12 oz Bags (Pack of 2)</a>.)<br /><br />My single 3 oz sample bag (purchasers will receive 10 bags) arrived only partially sealed, a rather surprising lapse in packaging that one hopes is uncommon.  Nevertheless, there remained enough coffee to produce several cups.  Taste and aroma seemed fine to me; in fact I detected no difference from regular gourmet coffees, but for the reasons stated above I also detected no change in my symptoms.<br /><br />In sum I think this a specialized product truly suitable only for noticeably acid symptomatic coffee lovers (you know who you are), and I would encourage them to give it a try and see if it helps (and still tastes worth drinking).  Puroast Low Acid Coffee is available in many different flavors, roasts, and blends, many different bag sizes, and many different grinds plus whole bean; to see what is available just click on the Puroast Low Acid Coffee "Author" Button above, or search Amazon using that name.

review/summary: Tastes good, but kicks off my reflux
review/text: The taste is decent.  Not good, but not really horrible.  If it didn't kick off my reflux, I could live with it.  But, unfortunately, it does, so I can't, so the taste is irrelevant.  I appreciate them trying!  Maybe a dark french roast isn't the best flavor for a low-acid coffee drink though?<br /><br />I'm rating this three stars because I think someone with less severe reflux might be okay with it.

review/summary: Great Taste with NO Heartburn
review/text: This coffee has quite a bit of flavor and punch to it, I love that its strong and flavorful (basically tastes just like the other coffee I drink). But finally I can have my cup of coffee without needing to remember to take a pill or suffering afterwards because of my heartburn. Highly recommended for those of you who get acid reflux and still want to enjoy your daily cup of coffee.

review/summary: Kind of meh.
review/text: I'm a long-time coffee drinker.  I don't suffer from chronic stomach acidity, so I can't attest to it's effect on tender stomachs.  What I CAN do is attest to the smoothness and flavor, which weren't anything to write home about.  It did seem to lack acidity, so I suppose those with tender stomachs could drink this with little worry.  The question is, should they bother with this?  I don't think so.  Stick to tea or do without.  The taste doesn't justify the bother to make it low acid.

review/summary: Not so good.
review/text: This is the worst tasting cups of coffee I've had in quite some time. I've had generic instant decaff coffee that tastes better. I don't know if it's their roasting technique, the quality of the beans themselves or the de acicification process, but it leaves you with a very bland tasting cup o'Joe. I was hoping I'd finally found a way to have caffeine again but I guess I'l have to stick with the decaff.

review/summary: Excellent low acid coffee
review/text: Puroast  Low Acid Coffee in French Roast is excellent.  It brews well and there is no loss of taste with it being low acid.  It<br />still tastes like full bodied French Roast and has a delicious smooth taste and nice color.  I have been disappointed in other low acid coffees but this met all my expectations for a full bodied cup of coffee without the acid stomach upset.

review/text: I like my coffee good and strong. I'll pay more for the good stuff. I got a sample of this for my husband.  We both tried it. The flavor is not so great, in my opinion.  My husband said it was ok.  He didn't mention that he felt better after drinking this coffee compared with other coffee.  I'm giving it a couple of stars for the possibility that it would help people that find coffee too acidic. I don' think we will try this again.

review/summary: Pretty good, not very robust
review/text: It didn't cause any stomach upset, but was pretty good. It's not as robust as one might like, and the aroma was not very strong either, but I would not go so far as to call it bland or anything. If you have a need for a low acid coffee I would say it might be a viable coffee option. I used the whole package to make one pot-- that quantity was about right for me.

review/summary: Works As Advertised
review/text: As a rabid, unrepentant coffee-drinker, I had to try this product.  Although I love the flavor and texture of French roast coffee, it's acidity tends to wreak havoc once inside of me.  Given my (minimum) two-cup a day habit, coffee can be tough going, to say the least.<br /><br />The Puroast brand delivered on the caffeine, but I found the flavor to be a bit bland, both straight and with cream.  I generally like my French roast to be strong, sharp and over-powering (so as to awaken me with a jolt and keep me fully hyped up), but the flip-side of this is typically very high acid content with the usual medical complaints.  To achieve that same full sensory experience, I had to use a bit more of it- about 1.5 times the usual amount of grounds that I brew of typical French roast in order to achieve a similar 'kick' from the coffee.<br /><br />In passing, I also like to spice up my coffee with either 1) a little cinnamon and Kahlua (usually during winter) or 2) one part twenty-year aged rum, minimum two parts Grand Marnier, chasing both with a strong batch of French roast filled to the rim of the mug (a kind of after-dinner dessert on the weekends for me).  I tried the latter recipe with and without a touch of cream, and while typically the coffee tends to eclipse the flavor of the alcohol mix, with Puroast both the aroma and taste of the aged rum and the Gran Marnier came through right nice as my ever-so-sensible British friends are fond of saying.  I also found that for best results with the combo of aged rum and Grand Marnier, Nestle's Coffee Mate French Vanilla product provided the best results, which featured a smooth, even finish combined with a creaminess that was, well, positively orgasmic!<br /><br />In sum, this product is an adequate and satisfying entry to the coffee space, and I highly recommend it to those who literally cannot 'stomach' their coffee.
