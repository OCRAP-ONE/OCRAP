review/summary: Good coffee however...
review/text: I shop at my military commissary and purchased this coffee during Christmas and loved it.  I paid $9.99 for one large bag.  I was wanting to buy more however the commissary ran out therefore I purchased it from Amazon.  I paid more but I did not care because I was looking forward to drinking this amazing coffee.  When it arrived I noticed the beans were darker than I recalled but figured it was my imagination, made a pot and was very disappointed, it did not taste as good as I remembered, still ok but no wow factor.  I  spoke with the manager of the commissary and asked if they could order more and they did.  When I saw it at the commissary I purchased a bag and compared the beans to the ones I purchased off Amazon, the beans WERE darker and had a shine to them, not the same as the bag I purchased from the commissary.  I made a pot and the coffee was excellent.  I don't get it, same company however it was better from the commissary and cost me $9.99 a bag.

review/summary: Hot diggity this is good coffee.
review/text: Purchased at Costco.  I've been trying all sorts of coffee, all sorts of brewing methods, call it a quest. (Dunkin'Donuts brand coffee is so sour to me I need a donut's sweetness to offset!  Life is too short for that sort of thing.  Starbucks is a dang bitter cup...probably best as espresso.  Trader Joe's 100% Kona tastes like it was filtered through a dirt shirt!) Lately I've been using either french press or melitta paper pour-over.  Either way, San Francisco Bay by the Rogers Family Co. is some very, very good coffee.  It is a good french roast, chocolaty, low acidity and sugar/cream seems to mess up the wonderfully subtle flavor dance so I just drink it straight.  I've found very few competitors to this brand, especially in a bulk bag!

review/summary: Fabulous coffee, ridiculous price
review/text: Our local Costcos stopped carrying this brand. I went online to try to find some. Ouch! Now $48 for 4 pounds. Guess we will do without. If price is no issue and you want excellent coffee, this is one of the best we have tried. It has a wonderful richness, smooth, non-bitter, all around excellent coffee. If I had to pay $12 a pound for coffee, I guess this is the one I would choose. But for now, I'll keep looking.

review/text: I & my husband really like this coffee. Multi-use either with the espresso machine or drip maker depending on the grindyou make. Only thing is the price offered by this vendor is a rip-off. Get it at COSTCO or get your local grocer to carry it. We highly recommend this coffee and it is well worth the effort to obtain it.<br /><br />Amazon isn't able to process my lower price findings.

review/text: Butterscotch (butter rum) lifesavers are hard to find in the stores (the individually wrapped ones), so I buy a case of these every so often for my elderly mother.  She likes to put a few in her purse and enjoys eating a few a day.  Because they are individually wrapped as well as sealed in the larger bag, they have a long shelf life.  I wish more stores would carry this flavor so I would not have to pay the shipping costs.  But it is for my mom.  What can I say?  :)

review/text: I forgot how good these tasted! I love butterscotch, but these Butter Rum candies are simply delish. I actually got them since I'm trying to stop smoking, and it helps to curb my cravings while giving my mouth something to do. It also keeps me from having to binge during the insane moment, and even shoves back my already-problematic sweet tooth. Compared to a candy bar, bowl of ice cream, or whatever else, I'll take the 60 calories of these per serving (4 pieces). Heck, one or two does the trick. The price is also great, considering how much a roll can cost on its own at the store compared to how much you get in a box with this purchase.

I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: Little Bitz for your Little Ones
review/text: I picked up these when the local pet store stopped carrying the thin bone shaped Little Bitz chicken and rawhide chews. The Beefeaters Little Bitz Small Round Chips are circular wafers of rawhide backing with a hard dried meaty topping. I was reluctant about getting these because they are about 1/4 of an inch thick though they don't seem to be more than an inch in diameter, and well I wasn't sure if it would be too big for my teacup's bite. My picky pooch seems to do ok with them though sometimes the cracking sounds she makes scares her but she cant get enough of these. I prefer the similar product by Beefeaters that are thinner less chunky. These are great for smaller breeds. But be warned they give my dog terrible gas. Only recommend these if you really love your fur babies and won't mind the smell.

review/summary: Healthy Vegan Smoothie Mix
review/text: I was looking for a vegan powder to add to smoothies. This looked interesting because the bag says "Add 1/2 - 1 cup water and mix", which seems simple enough. This mix is not good with just water (too thin), use unsweetened soy, almond, or coconut milk. It is too sweet to use with regular sweetened soy milk. I highly recommend the blender bottle, which is sold on Amazon, if you don't have a protein drink shaker. It's easy to add the mix, liquid, and just shake it up and go.<br /><br />This mix is really good in smoothies, to make a breakfast meal replacement before working out or just to start the day. Add water, a little bit of fresh fruit (1/2 mango, banana, or strawberries, work great), optional yogurt (fresh or frozen) and a few ice cubes and blend. It turns into a foamy and delicious tropical smoothie that is high protein, low fat, low sugar (only fructose), with lots of fiber. It's also very filling and will keep you full until lunch.<br /><br />The only downside is that it is expensive. The bag only makes 12 servings. It might be best to alternate this smoothie mix with a cheaper protein mix, if you use it daily.

review/summary: Best vegan protein shake out there.
review/text: I've been hearing mixed reviews about the vega shakes. The WFHO reviews have particularly scared me a bit because I have read that the shakes can be a bit gritty and over powered with stevia. I heard these shakes were different so I decided to give in and try the Vega brand. I was really pleasantly surprised. Initially when I opened the package I saw it was green and smelled a little nutty/bland which didn't scare me but I thought it'd taste like hemp. I blended it with 8 oz of unsweetened almond milk and a few ice cubes. It was really good. Definitely a tropical smoothie. Adding liquid completely transformed it. It wasn't gritty at all. It kind of reminded me of a starburst chew. I wouldn't say this is something I would want on it's own as a go to comfort food, but I could definitely do this for my morning breakfast. Out of all of the vegan/vegetarian/raw food shakes that I have tried (I've tried a lot and have wasted a LOT of money), this is by far the best tasting one. I've heard great things about the vanilla and chocolate mixes also so I'll be trying those next.

review/text: I am a vegetarian, but I strive to be as vegan as possible everyday, but thus far that has proved to be way more difficult than just being vegetarian...for me at least.<br />I was really nervous to try this due to the taste some of these shakes can have. Let's face it: They are usually disgusting. Some people can handle it NO PROBLEM. Others struggle with getting it down. Some of the healthiest things to eat or drink or not always the tastiest. LOL<br /><br />Let me just start by saying that this smoothie doesn't even SMELL bad.<br />It holds true to its Tropical Citrus title & it really smells amazing.<br />I mixed 2 tablespoons with 1 cup of Silk Vanilla Almond milk & just used the spoon to mix it up.<br />It was DELICIOUS. I could not believe it.<br />It was a little bit chunky, but very small chunks. I swirled it as I went & even the small chunks I drank didn't taste bad or gritty. Just dissolved in my mouth. I think I will invest in a thermos type thing to shake it in for next time, but it isn't necessary.<br />I will be using this probably once a day, preferably in the morning, just as a drink, not a meal replacement.<br /><br />If you are skeptical, just give it a try! It really is SO delicious. & it is truly a great addition to a healthy diet! PLUS VEGAN! AND 65% RAW!

review/text: I like all the Vega smoothie mixes. I do buy all their shakes and their oil. I love healthy food so I do not mind the green, spirallina and suppliment taste that some of these products have. If you can't handle the strong taste of these you may still like all the smoothies because they are mild in the supliment flavor department. I drink mine with water or put some into a fruit and greens smoothie. It is raw, vegan and has all the good for you "extras" that you now wont have to take a pill for. And a good tip is if you find your smoothie too watery... just reduce whatever liquid you used.

I don't find the product gritty and it dissolves pretty quickly in water.  However, it does settle some, so I have to swirl it while I drink, but it's no biggie! We drink the mix straight: we like it with just water and sometimes ice. The flavor is delicious, just a little bit sweet, but not too much.  It's perfect before and/or after a workout, or whenever I need a pick-me-up.

review/summary: Not too bad, a little gritty
review/text: First glance at the ingredients and I wasn't able to find fruit in the ingredients (at least, the fruit displayed on the front of the package). The powder itself is green, and looks more like a vegetable powder than something "tropical" (it doesn't smell tropical either). However, once mixed with water...it tastes like a fruit drink, which is surprising. It's not too off-putting, and is a nice change from the regular vanilla or chocolate protein powder I get in the mornings and post-workout. My only real complaint is that it is a little gritty - no matter how much I shake, there's still a little bit of grit at the bottom of my blender bottle.

review/text: I love this mix. The flavor is very good. It's mixes well in the glass shaker bottle I use.<br />Sometimes I add a little chopped fruit and shake with water. Take the lid off and eat the fruit.So far I have only used water. It tastes mildly tropical and it's sweet enough for me with no after taste. I plan to try with juice or skim milk but am happy with it using just water. Too bad it's so expensive I can only use it for a treat. If the price was better I'd drink more. It does have green flecks in it as I can see them through the glass shaker. Not a problem as it feels good having something healthy to drink and start the day. I do have to say one grandson did not like it but he is used to sweet smoothies from a blender. I love this drink!

review/summary: for Great Iced Tea!
review/text: Great iced tea and good hot tea, too! I use 5 bags in 1 quart hot water, let steep until cool, then add another quart of cool water. Makes a great refreshing iced tea - easy to drink and not too strong. Best of all, no caffeine so I don't get that buzz when I drink it in the evening. Only downside is that the price increases every time I buy it...

review/summary: Make Shaken Ice Tea Lemonade at Home
review/text: Starbucks serves Shaken Ice Tea Lemonade made with Tazo Passion Tea and I developed a fondness for the tea but not the four dollar price tag. I figured out how to make it at home and bought the tea in bulk here at amazon for a very good price. For those interested in doing this at home, this is how I did it for a half gallon.<br /><br />Half Gallon Pitcher<br />5 Tazo Passion Tea Bags<br />3/4 Cup Sugar<br />Juice of 1 to 2 Lemons<br />Boiling Water<br />Cold Water<br /><br />Place 5 Tazo Tea Bags and sugar in half gallon pitcher. Add boiling water and fill pitcher 2/3rds to 3/4ers full. Allow to steep for an hour. Remove tea bags and juice lemons, adding lemon juice to taste in pitcher. Fill pitcher with cold water or ice cubes. Voila - a great refresher all year round.<br /><br />Tazo teas are generally wonderful, but the bright cheery red and fruity, citrus taste of the passion is really wonderful. Enjoy this lovely tea today. Caffeine free and tasty and I am a black tea lover so to rave about an herbal tea means it is truly exceptional.

review/summary: Pretty darn good hot and great iced!
review/text: Tazo Teas is a relative newcomer to the tea market, having been founded in 1994 by Steve Smith. But, what Tazo lacks in history it makes up for in pure inventiveness!<br /><br />Among Tazo's many blends is Passion, a bold and flavorful mixture of hibiscus flowers, other tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass, and red poppy. Brew it up, and you are rewarded with a bright red infusion, that has a tart and exciting taste.<br /><br />Now, this tea is definitely not for everyone. As you can tell from the ingredients, this tea is strong and decidedly on the tart side. When drunk hot, you probably will want to sweeten it with honey or moderate it with milk, or possibly both. But, when made into an iced tea, Passion really comes into its own - decidedly refreshing and thirst-quenching. Just what you need for a hot summer day!<br /><br />So, overall I would say that this is a pretty darn good hot tea, and a great iced tea. Buy some today!

review/summary: Great tasting iced tea
review/text: Tazo's "Passion" iced tea has definitely turned me into a fan of hibiscus iced tea.  I have been using the Takeya 64 oz iced tea maker with one bag of Passion to make this iced tea and find the tea to be refreshing and healthy.  In my brew there is enough tart and just enough sweet and I've been drinking it almost every day since I got the tea and tea maker.  In fact, I was a bit worried I'd like it too much and get sick of it fast, so I picked up a box of Celestial's "Wild Berry Zinger" (first ingredient is hibiscus) for some variety and was pretty disappointed -- it tastes like a watered-down diet fruit punch drink.  Passion, on the other hand, is almost like the Mexican drink Jamaica (also made from hibiscus), except less sweet of course, and actually tastes like a real tea unlike Celestial's Zinger.<br /><br />How I brew the Passion:<br />-Fill Takeya 64 ounce iced tea maker almost to the top with filtered water.<br />-Add 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice (or up to one lemon).<br />-Add three tablespoons of Erythritol sweetener.<br />-Add one bag of Passion iced tea to infuser and let cold brew overnight.

review/summary: slightly tart bold herbal fantastic tasting iced tea
review/text: Normally I hate yucky flowery herbs like hibiscus and rosehips in my tea (such as Celestial Seasonings Tea) but one day while at Starbuck's, I was sweating, heated and tired in hot weather and wanted an iced drink but not coffee and since I'm really a tea drinker, I tried their Tazo iced teas and they tasted SOOOOO good and invigorating with just the purrrrfect balance of just enough herbs but still letting your senses know it was still TEA and the fragrance/taste comes out boldly!! The heated tea is nicely turned immediately, boldly, vividly, red in color. I don't need to add much sweetener even as it's tart but its tartness gives it more taste.<br /><br />The only drawbacks are its high price (compared to other teas which is why I'm always waiting for a sale on them) and having to wait to heat the water and waiting to cool it down in the refrigerator (or quickly in the freezer).  It's true as another reviewer said that it's very strong in taste after just leaving it in hot water for a few seconds so the longer you leave it in, the stronger and bitter or more tart it becomes and you could really be frugal and only need a tea bag for a half gallon to a gallon of water.  Adding ice helps dilute the taste as well as cool the tea down fast and cold, but I like my iced tea strong so i can taste its full flavor, so I try never to add ice.<br /><br />It's a delight as an everyday iced tea as well as a great gift for a friend.

Don't leave it in the water too long, or else it will get a slightly bitter taste.

review/text: Up until about 2 months ago, I was able to get the glass and PET plastic red VOSS bottles at the local grocery. I'm glad I found this online. For me, the taste was very clean, crisp, and clear. I don't like water in the first place and many of the other bottled waters taste like minerals to me. Voss was very refreshing and seemed to be "tasteless" and odorless. I like it ice cold, straight from the bottle. I highly recommend it. I'll only drink this or Dasani when possible. I tend to prefer San Pellegrino over all other sparkling waters as well. I have been fortunate enough to have never had issues with delivery and/or broken bottles.

review/summary: Basic but good
review/text: Planters does does a good take on the basic trail mix.  The fruit is pretty fresh and great tasting unlike a few other name brands I've had before that have a semi-stale taste/texture. Definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good snack and in nice broken down individual packets.

review/summary: Was Best trail-mix & Healthly breakfast food after morning excerise
review/text: This was 5 stars but now that Amazon has decided not to carry and that the seller on Amazon has doubled the price, I am lowering the overall score to 2 stars. I could see a 20% increase, but 100% gee. Anyway, I now order this from Staples.com at $25 less than current Amazon seller. If price becomes more reasonable. I'd buy thru Amazon's seller. But I must now change from 5 stars back to two stars, as this new pricing does not allow the product to get 5 stars from the current seller as priced.<br /><br />The technical and health value of my review below still applies.<br /><br />I enjoy Planters Trail Mix, Fruit & Nut, 2-Ounce Bags along with my bottle of cold water at least 4 early mornings every week. I order this specific trail mix and provide these individual servings to my other workout buddies as well (great to have friends jog/walk together, insuring no excuses to sleep in).  Other buddies provide the water.<br /><br />We've all naturally lost excess weight over the last 2 years with our made-up program. This trail-mix has been a part of the equation of success with our healthful breakfast and exercise. This product's combo of dried fruit, including Papaya, Raisins, Banana Chips, Pineapple, Cranberries, along with mixed nuts makes this the best tasting and good-for-us trail-mix after our workouts. Eating so well, after these pre-sunrise workouts puts me in the right frame of mind for the rest of the day and has helped me stay focused and eat well at lunch and dinner. I sometimes eat one of these as an afternoon snack too.<br /><br />One small warning: Under Amazon subscribe and save, I do have to often order this version of trail mix at least 20 days in advance before running out of my supply as this trail-mix must be popular to other Amazon consumers as well, as this specific product is often backordered on Amazon. Bottom line, I've tried many trail mixes and this is the brand+mix that is the best combining a great mixture of dried  fruit along with mixed nuts.

review/text: We switched to this dog food after our 12 yr old mixed breed dog started losing weight and developed severe dermatitis, itching, scratching and shedding! For 12 yrs, we had been giving her a name brand dry product we purchased at local pet stores.  She is a completely different dog these days!  She has gained back all her weight, is happy, and does not itch,scratch or shed.  I HIGHLY recommend this dog food!  It is made of natural, good ingredients.

The chicken flavor is also much enjoyed.  We, the owners, appreciate that our Callie is kept busy with a chew bone that is healthy, apparently delicious, and long lasting.  The Health Bone packaged was shipped with another treat product and well packaged.  Both arrived two days after I placed the order.

review/summary: My Dogs Love Them!
review/text: When it comes to chews my corgis are picky.  That's probably because they get a lot of raw meaty bones.  I was hesitant to try these, but the ingredient list sold me.  Turns out that both my boys love them!  And, the medium Health Bone is the perfect size for a corgi.<br /><br />The ingredients of Health Bone are superior to the other manufactured chews I've looked into.  They haven't caused any stomach upsets.  And, the dogs think they're terrific.  The only downside to Health Bones is the price.  But, I'm willing to pay a little more for for a high quality chew made in the U.S.

Although, within the timeframe of intial purchase, they are some of the best tasting on the market with no weird aftertaste.

review/summary: Good Flavors. Very Chewy.
review/text: My latest candies from a nearby store which sells British imports is Rowntrees Fruit Gums in an 8-sweets roll. They're good but I didn't like them nearly as much as Rowntrees Fruit Pastilles. The Fruit Gums are mildly flavored, but quite delicious. They're very chewy and stick to you teeth rather badly. Be sure to brush if it's before bedtime and be careful not to pull any fillings. My impression is that the flavor becomes more intense as you continue to chew and I find it most flavorful to chew two of the same flavor at the same time. Or, mix your flavors if you prefer. It's your dime. It's a nice candy, second only to the Fruit Pastilles from Rowntree.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Kids love it, but poorly packaged.
review/text: I bought this candy for an upcoming Lego themed birthday party for my 4 and 6 yr old sons.  I gave each of my 5 kids a few pieces to play with last night, and they love that they can build with candy and they think it tastes great (I do not agree, but I don't think the taste is really important here!) Based on that alone, I could have given 5 stars, except that a great number of pieces were broken as a result of poor packaging by Bayside Candy.  The 5.5 lbs of candy arrived in two sealed plastic bags inside a USPS Priority Mail envelope (the paper type).  The envelope was squished and ripped in several places, resulting in a substantial amount of broken candy.  Fortunately, I don't think the kids will care, but it's disappointing nonetheless.

review/summary: Helps prevent drymouth
review/text: I participate in CrossFit, where our workouts are often done "for time".  I also take a diuretic as prescribed by my physician, which often gives me a raging case of drymouth during my workout.  Having to pause during my workout to get a sip of water was really adding to time it took me to complete the workouts.  It was also interfering with the intensity of the workouts.  When I discovered this gum, I thought I'd give it a try since the concept reminded me of the old Gator Gum from when I was a kid.  This gum has been a lifesaver for me when it comes workout time.  I just pop a piece about the time the trainer says "3-2-1-Go!", and it keeps me from having to stop what I'm doing to down some water.  (It really seems to do a better job of keeping my mouth hydrated than that sip of water did anyway.)  All the flavors are acceptable, as well, which is nice.  The only down side I have found is that the flavor doesn't last very long.  I usually combat that by sticking an extra piece in my pocket or near my workout area so I can pop another piece during workouts that take more than 15-20 minutes.  Overall, I would highly recommend this product.
