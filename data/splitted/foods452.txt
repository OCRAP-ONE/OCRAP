review/summary: My favorite vanilla
review/text: Molina vanilla has always been my favorite. It has such a robust flavor that it makes everything taste better. I used to be able to buy it in Mexico, but living in the northeast makes that a little difficult. I was so excited to find this 12-pack for a great price!

This product's blend of real vanilla and vanillin tastes great and saves us a bundle, especially this 12 pack.  It's going to last us a few years.  I recommend it highly.

review/text: I have been using Molina Vanilla for a number of years as I used to live near the Mexican border and would go to Mexico in person to purchase it.  We have found through experience it far exceeds that which one can purchase in the grocery store and much less expensive.  Great in all cooking and especially in home made ice cream!

review/summary: Only one I buy now
review/text: I have a pancake junkie in my house and this, by FAR, is the absolute best mix available on the market.  It's just so very light, just like cake flour when you use it.  The only one i've found that's better is the Pioneer brand and that's only sold in the South.  Being a Northerner, I just have to suffer through but this brand is a very close second.  It's SO easy just to make one pancake too - just 1/2 cup of this and a 1/4 cup of water and it's in the pan!  Great for busy school mornings, especially with chocolate chips.  I also add an egg into the mix to give it more protein so the kids can make it to lunch without starving.  Great, great product, LOVE it! Highly recommend!

review/text: This like all Krusteaz products is simply outstanding, which can't be said for most "add water only" mixes. It is particularly well suited for a really large family or a vacation cottage not continually used. Kids actually prefer this to time consuming scratch 'cakes, although adding a few fresh berries, a little corn or oatmeal is popular, too. Only poor packing that resulted in minor spillage prevents a five star review.

review/text: I always buy Krusteaz Pancake Mix from our local warehouse store.  Let me tell you, ten pounds is *a lot* of pancakes.  My kids love the flavor, and I like it because it's so quick and easy.  What could be quicker than "just add water"?  Mix until the batter is slightly lumpy, just a few strokes, then cook.  The pancakes come up nice and fluffy.  We always keep a bag of this around the house for those mornings when I want to feel like I'm cooking -- but not.

The reduced price is better than any I can acquire from any store (except when on sale). The packaging is great because I can stack the unopened boxes in the pantry. I can also use the opened box as storage with easy access to the packs. I use this as a "gravy" for my dogs' hard food so do not use a full pack each time. The box allows me to sit the opened pack in the box to prevent spills.

It took a little longer than i was expecting, they still arrived in the shipping window. The drinks were packaged safe and secure and arrived without any problems. If i need more, i'll be coming to these guys for it.

review/summary: Monster Absolutely Zero
review/text: I conducted a taste test of six different brands of energy drinks and this one tasted the best.  I had tried one of them a long time ago and it had a strange taste I couldn't get used to despite what the kids at work told me.  This one tasted OK and was the only one that gave me the boost I wanted at the time. They are kind of expensive so I plan to use them sparingly.

review/summary: Best Energy Drink Around!
review/text: After I did some research on Americans' diet & diabetes and what not (my expanding pant size), I decided to reduce my carbs.  Which sadly meant cutting out my favorite energy drinks Monster & Rockstar.  Both brands have had low carb (diet) versions for a while, but they use artificial sweetners I'm not comfortable with & that, in my opinion, don't taste very good.<br /><br />Then along came Monster Absolutely Zero, sweetened with Erythritol, and I'm back in.<br /><br />I wish Monster would just make a non-enery drink with this sweetener & their flavor combinations, so that I could enjoy it later in the day, but at least I'm not chugging down 54 carbs per can in the regular stuff.<br /><br />I did mention that the taste is great right?  Yeah, that's a good thing.  Give it a try!

review/summary: Versatile Chipotle Sauce
review/text: Having lived more than two decades in Los Angeles....with endless access to a variety of Mexican (and other) cuisines that use smoked Jalapeno chilis (i.e., chipotle), this sauce is a great find.  Some of the ways we've used it so far (and love it):  mixed 50/50 with mayonnaise yields the "Subway chipotle sauce" good for sandwiches, mixed 50/50 with Italian dressing makes a deliciously different salad dressing, as a marinade for pulled pork...makes excellent Carnitas, alone on grilled chicken breast,  in burritos and tacos with ground beef or roast beef, etc.  Have not tried it on seafood or fish (and probably won't; it would overpower those).  If you enjoy the flavor of chipotle, but want to save the time needed to make chipotle sauce from scratch, you'll enjoy this condiment.

review/summary: YES, we found an easy way to make Subway's Chipotle Sauce
review/text: We searched all over the internet trying to find Subway's Chipotle sauce.  We were not interested in the various recipes we came across, too much time, effort, etc.  Then we found "Monkey's Monkey Farm" review, here, that stated if you mixed this sauce with an equal amount of mayo--you'd get Subway's Chipotle sauce.<br /><br />Well, my son absolutely LOVES subway's Sauce and wants their subs all the time, despite us making subs at home, all because Subway's tastes better due to the danged sauce.  So, even though I felt $21.00 was a lot of money for condiments, I bit the bullet and bought this sauce.<br /><br />I followed monkey's instructions, 50/50--and YIPPEEE, it tastes identical! If you are looking for Subway's Chipotle sauce, this is it!  Thanks Monkey!

review/text: First off, this is not glorified mustard, it is spicy chipotle sauce, someone i think didnt like the price so they had to cry about something.<br />But, Mixed with good mayo, it does taste like Subways sauce, I mixed mine with regular Hellmann's, at a 1 1/2 tablespoon Hellmann's to 1 tablespoon Chipotle sauce, it was just the taste i was looking for, if you have a stronger tasting mayo or like it fairly spicey, mix it 50/50.<br />The sauce was well worth the price and mixing it with mayo for sanwiches or burgers, the bottles will last a pretty good while.<br />OH, try it on porkchops, it adds a nice kick to pork.

review/summary: Subway substitute? Not quite.
review/text: I bought this after reading other reviewer's comments about mixing it with mayo to imitate Subway's Southwest sauce. Kind of an expensive gamble as far as condiments go, but it would have paid off if the mixture was close enough. Unfortunately it wasn't. I love Subway's chipotle sauce, but I'm sad to say that this is NOT it -- no matter how much mayo you mix it with, it still tastes just a bit like spicy vomit.<br /><br />Two stars only because I feel bad faulting the product based on someone else's recommended use for it. I'm sure there's a better use for it, and at least now I have two and a half bottles left over to experiment with, though I'm not looking forward to it. Just don't buy it expecting Subway sauce or you may be as disappointed as I was.

review/text: I have a small collection of finishing salts that I use for different things. This one is my favorite for things like salad and desserts. It's gorgeous with large crystal shapes that are very thin, some are just flakes, but other pieces are like shallow hollow pyramids. The flavor is mild and they have a nice snap which adds a textural interest to chocolates and candies.<br /><br />For more robust flavors, I prefer stronger flavored salts like smoked or Peruvian pink salts.

Can be used as the perfect breakfast bar or afternoon snack.  Delicious!

review/summary: Excellent taste and texture shame about the deceptive packaging
review/text: First I have to say I purchased these from a specialist store and not Amazon but I will be placing a Subscription order for them soon. The product was moist with an almost fruit cake texture which was perfect for me. The flavours where bold and I was excited to tell everyone I know about how good it is. On the downside, the packaging was very deceptive. I know it tells me the weight but when the wrapper is 50% wider and 50% longer than the bar it is really misleading. 'Pamela's' I would expect you to trim some of that waste so I do not feel so stupid and so guilty for the extra wrapper.

I dont say there were old, or bad. But do you know what I mean?<br />A fresh bear, is soft, feels almost wet..yumm..these were, a bit dry on the outside not as soft and just not as yumm.<br />But still enjoyable.<br /><br />Unfortunately I went trough only half the pack, then I found out that I am Diabetic...not a fault of the Gummi bears.

The bears were crammed together at one end of the packaging and very warm, so I popped the unopened bag into the fridge for a while.  When they had cooled, I opened the bag -- it's not a resealable bag -- and divided the bears into 5 ziplocs, eating the ones that fell onto the counter for, ummmm, health and safety reasons.  Hopefully, this will keep them fresh a long while.

review/summary: Lasted Me a Month
review/text: I have to admit, when I buy bulk food, I tend to go through it quite quickly.  Yes, even if it's candy.  It took me about 4 weeks to finish this bag.  Make sure to find a suitable container to put them in before opening, because they can get hard when exposed to air.  As my grandma would say, "Don't eat too many because they will give you tummy ache!"  Boy was she right...

review/summary: Hands down the BEST gummy bears!
review/text: I purchased these gummy bears about a year ago, as a gift for my daughter in law.  I took them out of the packaging and put them in a festive glass candy jar and gave them to her for Christmas.  The jar was big, but there was still more than half the bag left, so I was able to make two more gift jars!  I did sample the candy as well, and they were super fresh and delicious as always.  Haribo makes the best gummies, hands down.

review/summary: Best Gummy Bears EVER!
review/text: I first had these gummy bears in 1983. They were not available for purchase in the US at the time.  When they finally were, I have had many of my friends and family try them out and the all love them as much as I do.  They are the ones in the gold bag.  They chew a lot longer that others, because of their firmness. If you want to try a smaller quantity first, stop at your local WAL-MART and get a bag.  I think that you will agree with me, they are the BEST! ;)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVOSE4">Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears, 5-Pound Bag</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVT042">Haribo Gummi Candy, Original Gold-Bears, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Yummy Gummi :-)
review/text: I see some reviewers complaining of receiving hard Gummi Bears but mine we excellent; moist, juicy, chewy, and delicious! Better than a lot I've bought in stores. I'll definitely buy these again! The expiration date was over a year from the day they arrived, so they're not stale, either, as some have posted. If I remember correctly, these were made in Turkey, but I don't know that it really makes any difference. They tasted exactly the same as every other Gummi I've had before, except fresher.

review/summary: Haribo Gummi Bears - Review
review/text: I've ordered this package several times now and i've got to say - it's a good value!  A few things to know<br />1) It's a lot of product!  You might think you could eat all these yourself...you'd be mistaken, it's a TON of gummi bears!<br />2) Flavor - overall most of them have a nice flavor, not too powerful or sweet so your teeth hurt but just enough to be able to guess what color you picked without looking!<br />3) They make a great office treat!  I keep them in my office and my employees come in whenever they want and help themselves...it's a great invite!<br />4) I use the bag they come in to store them and roll it tightly up when i'm done to lock in the flavor!<br /><br />The only thing I would make you aware of is that the freshness does not quite live up to the standard.  About half of the time the gummi's taste is off (not as strong each time), with the texture being slightly harder (though not like a rock or hard candy) just not the same soft feeling they should be.  To compare it to a situation for example, say you walked into an office and they had a little bowl of these on the counter - it would be like grabbing one of those and you could tell it sat out for a couple days...not bad, still chewy but you could sort of "tell it wasn't fresh" - that's the only bother sometimes.<br /><br />For the above reasons, that's what I gave it 4 stars...1 star off just because the 1 in 3 bags that aren't as fresh as i'd want.  Good flavor, great value - enjoy!<br />I hope this helps!

They were still good but they had to be cut with a knife.

review/text: This really might be the best deal on Amazon, period. If you like Haribo Gummi Bears, there is no better deal to be found. They were perfectly fresh, and well, perfect. The only slight problem is that it's extremely dangerous knowing that you can get 5 lbs of Gold Bears for under $15...<br /><br />FYI, I accidentally learned that leaving these in the box, on the dryer when you wash clothes makes your whole house smell like Gold-Bears... which is AWESOME.

review/text: Well I placed my SECOND order for this bag a couple days ago. I first ordered them back in December for a Christmas present. I wanted to get something that would WOW him. We both absolutely LOVE Haribo Gummi bears. We buy them frequently. I knew he would be amazed at the size of the bag.<br /><br />They were soft, and very fresh! I put them around our apartment in various dishes. We love having them to snack on, considering we are both full time students, and part time workers. We are always on the go. Being able to grab a hand full and run is nice.<br /><br />They came in a box that was about 2 times the size of the bag. Like I said, very fresh, super tasty!<br /><br />Thank you Haribo!

The Haribo brand has an awesome quality and flavor to them that is uncomparable to all the other gummi bear brands I have had....I love that I can order a 5lb bag and have it delivered to my door!  It is a better deal than buying them at the store.  When certain stores have them on sale for 99 cents I usually stock up but now I don't have to!

review/text: WOW. That's what I said when this huge bag of Haribo gummy bears landed on my porch. I was slightly afraid that it would arrive at my home in one huge globby mess, but lo and behold, it got here just fine. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the bears weren't sticking to each other very much at all--as soon as I brought them into the house, the first thing i did was transfer them to tupperware containers (and put a batch in the freezer for frozen gummy bear treats), they lasted me a good 3 weeks! I was the only person to eat them, so if you have a family then I'd imagine they'd go a lot more quickly. All in all a great buy! And if you know you love these (but really, who doesn't?) then it just makes more sense to buy them in bulk this way. 5 stars!
