review/summary: Great idea, mediocre execution
review/text: I like really hot stuff, and Dave's "Insanity Sauce" is one of my favorites, although just a little beyond my maximum "hot!" I really hoped that this product would give me the ability to have one source of heat on the table that could serve all tastes, from mild to "way hot." Unfortunately, this well designed product lacks much "oomph" at the high end of the scale. In fact, the hottest spice available is only as hot as the regular Tabasco Sauce, if even that.<br /><br />If this could be boosted so that the hottest setting gave something that hot pepper fans would consider to be at the edge, it would be fantastic. As it is, I'm thinking of returning the three bottles for a refund. Sorry, Dave.

review/text: These were to be our 5th, 6th, and 7th bottles of this. We're addicted. It's great to be able to adjust the heat of the spray.<br />December 2010 REVISION: All three bottles we received from Amazon this time are defective! One would not spray at all, the other two worked for a short period of time and then stopped working. The company claims they have never had complaints from anyone else; they replaced one bottle but then said I should just get a refund from Amazon. I offered to send the (full) defective bottles back to them, but they are not interested.<br /><br />January 2012 REVISION: Amazon replaced these, and the new batch works fine. We love this sauce!

review/summary: Quick, Easy, Delish Rice Porridge
review/text: This is a wonderful rice topping and it has all the same toppings normally used in "ochazukemono" -- a kind of rice porridge.  Ochazukemono, to steal a line from Ratatouille, is a peasant dish. It is commonly eaten as a snack in Japanese homes.  Ochazukemono is simply rice with dried salmon flakes and dried seaweed covered with a tea cup of green tea.  While this dish is surprisingly simple, it remains one of my most enduring "souvenirs" from Japan.  I love this furikake because I can sprinkle it over rice, add a tea cup of green tea and have a quick, nutritious and (I think) delicious snack.

review/text: I was afraid it was going to taste like what I'd imagine fish food smells like, but I decided to take a chance since it's salmon. It didn't taste fishy to me... and it was delicious!!! I don't know the exact type of rice we eat, but we always get ours from an Asian grocery store in Charlotte. Add this (amount is based on your taste) to 1/2-1 cup of hot, steamed rice and compress it into a shape of your choice to get a tasty treat in less than 2 minutes (if the rice has been made already). I'm looking forward to adding this to chao ga (Vietnamese chicken porridge) in the future. My mother is contacting our favorite store in Charlotte to ask them to stock up on this kind of furikake. It's that good.

review/text: I've just tried this seasoning this morning and it tastes super good. I actually went back to my room to cook more white rice just to eat with it, a little soy sauce (very little), few drops of sesame oil and a little bit of chili sauce (sriracha). It was one of the best meal I've ever eaten. The aroma of the seasoning when it hits the hot white rice makes my room feel very cozy.

review/summary: not bad but...
review/text: i bought a jar of this about a year ago and i still have most of it. it's not bad but, well, it's really fishy and i just can't get past the unnerving resemblance to fish food. i like lots of other furikake flavors (especially wasabi) but this one just doesn't do it for me. it's alright when eaten very soon after putting it on rice or couscous but the texture/flavor of it after sitting for a few hours is quite unappetizing. i now understand why people buy those little conatiners that let you take a portion to sprinkle on right before eating.<br /> maybe i'll try the tea/soup thing charlotte ann hu mentioned. that actually sounds pretty tasty and the flavor of the tea might help cut the fishiness. as for the price and vendor, the price is very reasonable and it arrived fairly quickly and in excellent condition.

Peanut is used in some Chinese dishes if sesame paste is not available but it isn't as good as sesame. There's also no way to know how much is sesame and how much is peanut. At $11 a jar there's no excuse for the peanut. Also there is another source for this product @ $5.99, a saving of $5.

review/text: We at Polar strive for the highest standards with customer satisfaction and appreciate any and all feedback about our products or service. Recently, we have seen the public focus directed negatively at highly processed oils in manufactured foods.<br /><br />After great research with our suppliers, I'm happy to confirm that our "vegetable oil" is neither soybean oil nor cottonseed oil. In fact, our suppliers pride themselves in using only rapeseed oil. This ingredient is FDA approved and a great source for the healthy Omega-3 and -6 fatty acids.<br />At this time, I'd like to direct anyone interested to a helpful article penned by the Independent/UK about this widely used but unheralded ingredient:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />P.S. Personally, I love to grab these for a quick and healthy protein boost when I don't have time to cook a full meal. Just one pot of rice and some steamed veggies - grab a can of herrings or kippers and voila, dinner is served!

The only problem is that the hot tomato sauce is not spicy at all! However paired with any spicy noodle soup and an egg and it makes a great meal.

review/text: I bought these after buying the mustard sauce kippers.  I figured that the mustard were good what could go wrong.  At the worst I would have bunch of cans of tomato covered fish and I can always just heat them up, put some ketchup on them and have a fish sandwich. Polar got another recipe right. These things are pretty good. The sauce has just enough spicy zip to make them have creole flavor without toasting you tastebuds. (I still think I might try the fish sandwich idea, they are that good!) I will buy them again.  The fish is firm with just the right amount of smoky flavor.

review/text: Very good for snack or lunch. I do not think the sauce is hot - perhaps little spicy but not like your regular hot sauce.<br />The only negative I have with these is not the herring but the can - trying to open it without sauce splashing all over is little tricky - the can is filled with the sauce to the rim.<br />But like I said, it is nice and healthy snack or lunch and overall, I do recommend it - I will buy them again.

They are actually packaged in Germany and marketed by Polar.  When I found them on Amazon at such a great price I immediately ordered them.  Regrettably they arrived dented and had burst open in transit and the smell was terrible.  Amazon quickly sent me a new shipment to replace the damaged ones so lets hope they arrive in better shape this time.  Kudos to Amazon for quickly replacing and that's why  I love Amazon!

review/summary: Taste OK; not hot; contains "vegetable oil".
review/text: I tried these after I tried the same brand in mustard (see my review of those in my list of reviews). First, you have to have no illusions as to how hot this thing is: not hot at all. Mildly spicy, that's all. I liked the taste of these kippers (just as I liked the mustarded ones). One warning though: ingredients include "vegetable oil". Google on this expression to find out why it's not good food (a "vegetable oil" most likely is some or combination of highly processed soybean oil, or cottonseed oil, or something similar -- these, nutritionally, are bad for you. Cotton isn't even a food crop, so you can imagine what you end up eating, it's completely unregulated). Well, at least this product does not contain gluten, so it's marginally less unheathful than the mustard version.<br /><br />The taste is quite all right though. Despite this, it will not become a staple in this household (due to "vegetable oil"). The best option remains the no-frills unflavoured version that contains more fish and nothing but water and salt in addition. I'll stick to those.<br /><br />------------<br />03/01/2012: In response to commenter "Mister No" who wrote:<br />> Vegetable oil is not ok for you and artificial flavoring<br />> and paprika sauce instead of tomato sauce is ok for you?<br />Yes. I'm unaware of any harmfulness of guar gum (modified starch feels more ominous, but again, I've never read of anything evil about it). What about paprika sauce? Paprika is pepper. What's wrong with pepper? Or was it paprika sauce instead of tomato sauce? Now, that would seem like a taste preference... paprika, in this product, is probably to supply the "hotness", not to replace tomato. Anyway... Some commenters leave mysterious comments... (Perhaps Mister No could elaborate?)

Really great delivery time and such, they just need to box them up and charge for delivery.<br /><br />We would not have had any issues again, I might order from them again if they could assure me that they would be shipped in a safer manner.

Keeps his coat soft and the low calorie really does work. After feeding him crap food full of fillers (pedigree, purina, etc) I switched to this about a year ago and it has been a nice slow and steady drop in weight for the cat. He absolutly loves this stuff, he is ussually standing at the bowl waiting for me in the morning all excited! Now that he has thinned down I will be transitioning to the indoor cat food.<br /><br />The best part is you can save a few bucks on amazon or if you need it in a pinch Petco always has it, but its ussually a few bucks more.

review/text: This food works out to be the best dry food for my overweight senior cat. I was trying grain-free foods for a while and he just gained a lot of weight and became constipated. Mixing it with this food helps reduce those problems. My cats do well on it and seem to like the taste of it, too. The small round kibble size is convenient for treat balls and automatic feeders. I feed them wet food twice daily, and then leave portions of the dry food mix out while I'm at work or sleeping so they have something to snack on. I would not recommend feeding exclusively dry food, but if you do feed some then this one seems like a good choice to try.

review/summary: Buy this cat food, great quality, reasonable price!!!
review/text: This is an excellent high quality cat food at a reasonable price.  While it is double the price of your average store cat food like 9 lives, it truly saves you money in the end.  I have noticed over 3 months of use that my cats are eating less as they are more satisfied now and getting the nutrients they need.  I purchase cat food literally half as often so in the end am spending the same as if buying a poorer quality food. Also believe it or not, there is far less in the litter boxes now (no doubt due to less processed junk to eliminate and eating less quantity)so in the end I'm saving on litter as well.  The best part is there is a notable difference in my cats health.  All have shinier, softer coats and my 5 year old boy jack seems to be suffering less with allergies and his sensitive stomach.  Definitly a wonderful buy and a great product!!!  Shipped fast.

review/summary: Adding water solves a problem for one cat
review/text: We have two cats. One cat eats normally and the second tends to overeat. I started using this product when both were under a year old and have continued as they are growing older. I have large feeders that allow the cats to freely eat or drink water.<br /><br />Recently the "over-eater" was at the vet and was found to have abnormal blood tests indicating a possible kidney problem. The vet suggested giving her more water and starting her on a kidney diet. I decided to try another idea before we went to the more expensive special formula. I put out a dish of water and added a handful of this cat food to the water. Our "over-eater" went right to the dish, sniffed and then began lapping the water. The second cat came over to investigate, waited until the food had absorbed the water, and began eating the moist food. Both cats seem to favor the moistened food but will often add the dry food to their diet. One month after starting this routine our "over-eater had normal kidney function tests.<br /><br />I have gradually added more water to the bowl, looking for the best mix so the food stays moist and the bowl has food in it for half a day. I now clean and refill it twice a day.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0020LNABS">Natural Balance Dry Cat Food, Reduced Calorie Formula, 15 Pound Bag</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0020LNABS">Natural Balance Dry Cat Food, Reduced Calorie Formula, 15 Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: Not sure, but the cats like it
review/text: I have no idea if this stuff is working. I purchased it because I have 2 cats that share an automatic feeder. That's probably my first mistake (of many). Small cat is spot on for her ideal weight, so I bought this food for The Fatty. Small Cat has maintained her weight despite the reduced calorie formula, but I do think that The Fatty looks a bit more trim and doesn't hang *quite* as low to the ground. The trade off, however, is that Fatty Face is now constantly underfoot, yelling at me to feed him and Small Cat will literally take food off your plate when you're not looking. They're always trying to break into the food closet and both of them get into the garbage if there's ANYTHING edible in there. They don't look like they're starving, but I feel like I'm now the proud owner of two raccoons.<br /><br />If you have the determination to ration your cat to less calories, then I would recommend this food. Seems easy on the stomach, neither of my cats turned their nose up at it, it's well priced for its quality, and FatFace Cat might be losing weight.<br /><br />I just hope you have garbage cans with lids.

review/summary: My cat loves it just as much as the non-reduced calorie version!
review/text: After trying various wet and dry cat foods for my then 6, now 7 year old cat, I finally tried the regular version of Natural Balance Cat food. He liked it more than anything else that I tried and so I stuck with that until I noticed that he still had a bit of a gut.<br /><br />I initially bought a small bag of the reduced calorie formula because I was worried he wouldn't like it. That disappeared as soon as I gave him a bowl of the reduced calorie formula. He munched on it like it was the regular formula.<br /><br />Since then, I buy the big 15 pound bags about every three months or so. I use an automatic feeder so that he can eat whether or not I am able to get out of bed that day. Even though he has access to a month's supply via the automatic feeder, he doesn't have the gut he used to. He's still a BIG cat, but not that much overweight, which is much better for his health.

review/summary: Matt likes it very much
review/text: Granted, Matt is now 21 pounds and needs to lose weight (maybe 4 or 5 pounds according to the vet) because he will eat just about anything, but he really likes this cat food.  We have to measure his food and can never leave any out for him because he will eat all day if left to his own devices.  No, he does not get any people food.  He did love Natural Balance from the start, and we have never bought this particular brand before.  Matt is 12 years old, so he is considered a senior, just like me.  I do not like doing this, but because he is so particular about his litter box, I have to scoop it every day (otherwise, the consequences are not pretty).  So, before starting him on Natural Balance, I noticed that his stools had become pretty loose over the last couple of months.  That immediately changed with the Natural Balance; everything is more solid, plus he is a little more regular than he was, although older cats do not always go number 2 every day.  Anyway, he is happy, and so am I.  I will revisit this review once time has elapsed in order to report on whether this product has helped Matt to lose weight.

review/summary: Great product - really works
review/text: My cat was eating the regular Natural Balance Ultra Premium formula until I realized there was a reduced calorie formula. She was overweight at the time, and she lost a pound after eating this food regularly for about 2.5 months. She was then switched to a half dry/half wet diet to increase her hydration, and she now also eats this same formula but in the wet food. She wakes me up every morning for her dry breakfast before my alarm goes off. She loves this stuff, and it makes her coat soft and shiny on top of her weight loss! I would definitely recommend this product to others. (The only downside I've noticed is that the small kibbles are small enough that she just swallows them whole most of the time, and if they were bigger, they'd help clean her teeth as she bites them--then I wouldn't have to brush her teeth!)

review/summary: 5 year old cat likes this stuff
review/text: I have been feeding my 5 year old indoor cat this cat food for a year now.  At first he was picky about the change in food and didn't eat as much.  I am now thinking that he just didn't need as much and that he was satisfied faster (it could be possible).  At any rate, my cat's weight was a concern a year ago and I was limiting his access to food.  Switching to this low calorie brand I have gone back to leaving food constantly available and he is actually at a better weight than he was a year ago.  I am very happy about this as it makes feeding him so much easier.  I have a very happy cat and that is important to me.  The only downside about this formula is that I live in a smaller urban apartment and when my cat uses the litter box it can stink quite strongly ... it can prompt me to ventilate the apartment with a window fan.  Though, my cat is healthy and his coat is as soft as when he was a kitten.  Over all, he's happy and so am I.

review/summary: Cats like it
review/text: All 5 cats prefer Purina One Chicken if given the choice. But, this food goes over quite well if there is no Purina in sight. So Purina is now given only a couple of pieces at a time for a special "treat" until it is exhausted...and I won't buy anymore.<br /><br />Natural Balance Reduced has about 1/3 less calories than Purina. I'm hoping it reduces my 1 little chubby and my one giant old mama before she comes down with diabetes or heart disease or...  Only time will tell. If it works, I'll come back and give it 5 stars.<br /><br />I do very much like the fact that the first ingredient is chicken and not corn meal like the RD which the vet gave me...amazing. The vet's RD had about 40% less calories, but cats did not like it, even when desperate. All they did was follow me around and moan. They know that corn meal is not chicken.<br /><br />March 2012 update: changed to 5 stars since big mama is slowly losing weight. 22 lbs down to 19 in about 6 mos. is good going.<br /><br />Found another good brand for supplements: Petnaturals (amazon does not carry it). I use their Hip & Joint for my old arthritic baby & she loves it. Attracting flavor ingredient: Chicken liver. But it's only a supplement (few tabs) for arthritis with the main stuff being Chondroitin, Glucosamine, just like we take. Also gonna try their Herpes support (she was born with it). Zoe is 14 yrs old, and HAS slowly been losing weight on the NB lite...the "slowly" is very important. Too fast and they get fatty liver which will kill 'em. Very happy with this stuff. Her coat is nice (long-hair tangly as usual) but she tries to wash again and her eyes are bright. A little pricey, but worth it.

So now I have to mix the reduced with the Indoor.  They still seem to pick at the Indoor and leave the reduced calorie in their bowls.  Man, cats can be so picky.

review/text: As a proud pet parent of a six-pound Yorkie, I try to provide her with the healthiest possible food and treats - preferably products that are made in the United States, given the recent issues with pet food and toys made in China and other countries.<br /><br />The little one LOVES these Z-Bones (Apple Crisp is her favorite, though she also enjoys the Cherry flavor) and they're the perfect size for her to chew on. They usually provide her with 20 minutes of quality chew time, and are GREAT for improving her breath. They're easy for her to digest, as well.<br /><br />One word of caution, which applies with ANY dog treats or bones: supervise your pet! When they get to the end of these things, that little piece is just big enough to get lodged in their throat if you're not watching them!<br /><br />Overall: a great, healthy product made in the U.S.! Your dog won't be disappointed!

When I went to the online store I was redirected to Amazon to complete my purchase. But when they arrived a week later they were so hard I couldn't even bite into them. Yuck! I couldn't send them back because they are a food item. If you like soft licorice - then don't buy these ones!

review/summary: Make sure it's sweetened with Splenda ... :)
review/text: This is the ONLY sugar free syrup that my husband and I can tolerate eating. It actually tastes pretty good. We believe the key to this is that this syrup is sweetened with Splenda. My husband still preferes the Mrs. Butterworth extra butter and Aunt Jemima butter rich, but will still choose this Maple Grove Farms butter flavor if he's watching his calories on that particular week. Is this the best flavored syrup in the world to eat? No. My first choice would be home-made syrup like my dad used to make when we were kids ... but we believe that Maple Grove Farms' Sugar Free Butter Flavor sweetened with Splenda is the best tasting sugar free syrup out there. We also can't figure out if Amazon's price is listed for an individual bottle (which we believe it is, but is over twice what we pay locally) or if the price is for a case of syrup (which we think would make it too much of a price savings). So, since it isn't listed as a case, we will unfortunately continue to try to find it locally for normal prices. It's always out of stock recently on our shopping day, which has lead us here in the first place during our search for syrup. I guess next time it's in stock downtown, we'll buy a case while we're there. Or perhaps I'll try the family recipe with Splenda and see what happens after the smoke clears. :)

review/summary: A Delicious Curry But Poor Quality Paneer...
review/text: Having started to fall in love again with India food, my mother surprised me by purchasing this 5 pack of MTR Paneer Tikka Masala. Chicken Tikka Masala happens to be my favorite so it seemed like having it with Paneer was going to be a treat. That was not the case however. While the packages of this pre-made curry were very good, and I personally would order it again, I also found the packaging and product very misleading.<br /><br />To start, we'll go over some positives. Each package of Paneer Tikka Masala contained ample amount of gravy and paneer. In terms of flavor, the gravy was delicious and has some spice to it. It went well with both Basmati rice and Brown rice. Despite a 3 serving rating, I found each package made 2 comfortable servings that would satisfy a hungry appetite. Overall I would say the best part of the product is the gravy. It is delicious!<br /><br />However, there are some problems here that I should warn you about. The package lists this as a MILD spice but it is more like Medium/hot spice. I enjoy spicy food so this didn't bother me, but in my book this clearly isn't even close to MILD spice. While the gravy portion is absolutely DELICIOUS, the Paneer is sub-par at best. It tasted fairly flavorless and was chewy, no where even close to restaurant quality, in fact they tasted almost like heavily processed flavorless-cheese. Another problem I have is well, where is the "Tikka?". Not only does this "not" look like Tikka Masala but it doesn't taste like it at all. It has a very heavy "Onion" flavor to it rather than smokey tomato flavor, which is probably why they call this a "spicy onion gravy". If the package is MILD why then call it Spicy Onion? The product doesn't even come close to what is on the box. The box shows authentic white Paneer with a tikka masala gravy. What the packages really contain are Greyish-cubes they pass off as Paneer, and a onion soup colored gravy. Very misleading and not even in the same ballpark as Tikka Masala.<br /><br />I know I'm being harsh but the product is a little misleading. It really isn't a Tikka Masala like most are used to, but a Spicy Onion curry w/ low grade Paneer. Despite all these oddities, the gravy still is outstanding! Almost addictive I'd say! For the price you do get a delicious meal for 2 with each package that takes under 2 minutes to make. I still would recommend a purchase, and I would personally buy this myself it really is that good! Just understand that instead of an smokey tomato/onion gravy, you actually end up with a Spicy Onion gravy. If you do not like spicy food I would avoid this, however if you are a big fan of Indian Curry, and don't mind some spice, you can't go wrong. Just don't expect much from the Paneer or very much Tikka flavor.<br /><br />** Each Packet makes 3 servings ** (I found it really made more like 2 comfortable portions)<br />Calories: 180 per serving (540 total)<br />Fat: 9g (27g total)<br />Cholesterol: 24mg (72mg total)<br />Sodium: 400mg (1200mg total)<br />Carbs: 18g (54g total)<br />Fiber: 1g (3g total) / Sugar: 1g (3g total)<br />Protein: 8g ( 24g total )<br />Vitamin A: 2% per serving / C: 4% per serving / Calcium: 6% per serving / Iron: 2% per serving

review/summary: Would buy again
review/text: For "instant" food, the quality of the sauce is pleasantly surprising.  It's spicier than I would expect (the box says "mild"), but it is not overwhelming and has lots of flavor.  The pieces of paneer are smaller than what is shown on the box, and not as good as what you would get in a restaurant.  I don't know how this brand holds up to the other instant brands, so I can't make that kind of comparison.  It was tasty enough for me to want to try other MTR dishes in the future.  Overall, it's a very tasty quick dish--I used the microwave method instead of boiling the pouch in water.

review/summary: Good Flavor, Excessive Gravy
review/text: This straightforward side has rich, bold flavor, with firm cubed paneer (pressed cottage cheese) in thick gravy.  The taste grabs and holds your attention so that, though it's a side dish, it doesn't cower meekly by the entr&eacute;e.  Though this is a vegetarian (not vegan) dish, the intense gravy gives the firm paneer a beef-like texture and flavor.  It stands well beside any Indian, and many Western, main dishes.<br /><br />One simple warning: this dish produces plenty of gravy, but far less paneer than the package photo suggests.  You should serve this dish with rice, bread, or another simple starch to absorb the excess; otherwise, you'll have a plate of gravy and nothing to eat with it.  I find it mixes well with basmati rice, though I imagine it would also blend with onion kulcha or other Indian bread.

review/summary: Tastes great, but be careful when you nuke it
review/text: Tasty, very convenient, especially if you don't live near an Indian restaurant (closest one to me is just over an hour's drive away) This packet is way easier and cheaper than takeout. Easy to microwave, but cover it very well, it likes to splatter. I do a paper towel *and* a paper plate on top of the bowl. Trust me, it's messy if you don't. You'll probably want some rice or naan to go with it, as there is a lot of sauce compared to paneer. Also, if you're concerned about portions, you'll want to know that the packet is more than one official serving, but it is so good that I usually have it all for one meal. Sounds like a lot of details, and a bit more prep than some nuke and go meals but it so worth it. Yum.

review/summary: Great coffee at a good price
review/text: I was used to drinking a regional brand coffee that turns out was very bitter and acidy. I do love dunking donuts coffee, but at a cost of over $1 an ounce thats a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I started looking for a "fair traded" coffee and I ran across screaming monkey brand. It couldn't have turned out any better, once I figured out the proper amount to use for 4 cups, it was so smooth and tasty. Also, there are no jittery coming down symptoms when the caffeine weares off. It doesn't make me pee right away like the cheap coffee's (which I avoid drinking at all cost) and its a total pleasure drinking. I will also note the distinctly different aroma when you open the bag, its not what you'd expect to smell, not in a bad way at all, its just a little different, and once you brew up a proper pot, soo good.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: If you like strong, flavorful coffee - this is your brand. We purchase the whole beans, as opposed to the ground product, but it makes no difference in the taste. Great stuff and good service.

review/summary: Luscious caesar dressing
review/text: Lately, I haven't been able to find this salad dressing mix in the stores.  So, I ordered 2 boxes of the Simply Organic Classic Caesar Dressing from Amazon.  Using safflower mayonnaise and organic milk or half-and-half, I get raves from my dinner partner whenever serving this on salad.

review/summary: Great morning cup..
review/text: I have been drinking this for months now, I truly notice a difference when I skip a day. I helps me concentrate and relax. I also love the taste, so if you like regular diner coffee (I am not a Starbucks fan) that is not bitter with many health benefits then this coffee is for you!

review/summary: G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung!! This is a great German ale!
review/text: Hailing from Kelheim, Germany,  this 8.2% ABV wheat doppelbock ale has been one of my favorites for nearly a decade.  Semi-opaque with a medium brown color, this German ambrosia has a full bodied Bavarian flavor that quickly permeates the senses.  Out of all of the wonderful beer offerings from Germany, Aventius continues to be my favorite.  Oddly, however, it's really only existed on the marginal fringe (at least in MPLS) of the German beer universe.  Maybe this is a good thing; I would hate to see this ale ruined by some soulless entity like InBev.<br /><br />If you like German beer, please try this one.
