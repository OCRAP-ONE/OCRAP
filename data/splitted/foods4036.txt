Actually ordered the set just for the vanilla bean(which I haven't even used yet..lol) and I am about to order another set because I am out of the extract and the sugar.  Vanilla flavor is very intense and comes through beautifully in baked goods. I would recommed this product to anyone!  My only complaint is that is $1.00 more this time....lol...it's well worth the extra dollar though.

review/summary: Great Balanced Choice for Dog Nutrition
review/text: When we adopted our dog six months ago, we went to both the local big box pet store and the boutique store in our neighborhood to read the ingredient labels of every bag of dog food. We knew we had to make an informed choice up front since it is so hard to change your dog's diet, especially when she is in that nervous phase between shelter life and home life. We found that the Pinnacle brand had the greatest balance of nutrition and edibility (i.e. actual food ingredients that would be easy to digest). Our dog loves it so far, it keeps well in our storage bin and all around it is nice to feed our dog something that we know is giving a solid nutritional foundation every day.<br /><br />As a side note, this food is also a great size to use for training and to put inside chew toys. We found that some of the kibble size of some of the other brands were a little too big for this sort of use.

review/summary: A dog food my dogs actually like :-)
review/text: I made the mistake of feeding my dogs a lot of people food over the years.  I wanted to get them back on crunchy food to clean their teeth, and to make sure they are getting balanced nutrition.  The problem is that they now turn their noses at even many of the better dog foods.  I got a sample of this dog food to try, and they will even eat it like dog treats.  Your mileage may vary, so it is best to try with a smaller bag to make sure that your dogs actually like it.  However, it is worth a try!

review/summary: Great treats!
review/text: My husband picked up a bag of these when we found out our dog had some serious allergies and tummy issues. The fellow selling them at his shop said these would be great. He was right! When I first saw the bag, and the little tiny treats, I thought they couldn't possibly be that much of a treat for our 90 pound dog used to big rawhides and bones. He went NUTS over these things! And, because they are small, the bag lasted a very long time. I am very impressed and will probably only buy this brand of treats for my dog from here on out! They are low in proteins, which our dog needs for his stomach problems, and they are chewy, so very easy for him to digest. And, apparently, they are ridiculously tasty from the way he flies across the room now whenever he hears the bag crinkle. :-)

review/text: I made my first deep fried turkey last night.  I generally use a pepper rub when I make turkey, but the oil would have washed it off, so I used Tony Chachere's Style Butter Marinade and was dazzled by the results!  Everyone agreed it was the best turkey they had ever had.  I highly recommend giving this product a try.<br /><br />Please note--this is a butter marinade, not a spicy Cajun marinade.  It's wonderful, but if you are looking for the heat, you may want to look at other alternatives.  This was smooth and, as the name suggests, very buttery.

He had been fed good quality foods all his life but started developing dry skin, hot spots, etc.  While we tried many things, including vet prescribed medications and other premium foods, nothing did anything more than treat the symptoms.  A few weeks after starting with "Blue" his coat and skin are beautiful again and he is no longer suffering from itchy skin.<br /><br />I am not prone to "rate inflation"; this truly earned its 5 Stars.

review/summary: The Best Food for My Dog
review/text: If you love your dog like family and want the best food for him, I recommend Blue Buffalo.  The first ingredient in my dog's food should be meat, not corn.  How many wild dogs do you see roaming in corn fields eating that stuff?  Cheaper brands would dry out my dog's skin and make it flakey.  I feel good about feeding Blue Buffalo to my Chihuahua because it is all natural and the pieces are small enough for a toy dog to chew, yet a larger dog could eat it as well.  I got the senior recipe because he is 12 years old and my vet told me that an older dog needs less fat and protien due to being less active and having aging kidneys.  Plus, the price on Amazon is way cheaper than the local pet store.

review/summary: Great for sensitive stomachs!
review/text: I switched my to 13 year old Westies to this food around one year ago. They have very sensitive stomachs and they tolerate this food well. The only problem is that they spit the little "Life Source Bits" all over the floor and they only eat the larger kibble. One way around this is to moisten the food , which they love so much they overeat and then vomit! When the food is dry they eat just what they need- and they have never had a weight problem or any major health issues in their lives so I don't want to mess with that ! Overall, great food, just a drag to have to vacuum the little bits that they spit.

review/text: An outstanding tea with lots of flavor.  None of those special/weird flavors that most teas have these days. Just a good strong tea flavor.  The Orange Pekoe refers to the size of the leaves that were plucked and not any flavor or color.  The bags are round with no string which suits me fine since I brew most of my tea in the coffee pot...<br /><br />A tip...  fill the coffee maker with water, 10-12 cups.  Place 5-6 tea bags in the empty pot and switch on.. leave for around 20 minutes. You will then have a full pot of lovely tea.. and unlike coffee, you can keep the pot switch on for some time and it will not `burn'.

review/text: I was a Lipton die hard Ice tea drinker until I tried a sample of Tetley Tea round tea bags in my Ice Tea, now I'm addicted to the smooth,smooth flavor. That's they ony way I can explain it. It has a Great taste and it feels so Smooth going down.  I've  even turned a lot of my family and friends into Tetley Tea lovers too.<br /><br />Just try it once and see if you don't agree.  I won't drink anything else and if I can't find it at the stores in town I'll buy it from Amazon on line. I don't ever want to be with out.<br /><br /> Tku,<br /><br />~~Trish~~

review/summary: Took me by surprise
review/text: I've kept away from American tea brands ever since discovering Twinings many years ago. There was no comparison. Twinings English Breakfast was my usual daily fare ... until I gave Tetley British Blend a go, as the Brits might say. Now I can't get enough of the stuff. This blend at this strength is an absolute winner. You might even call it a tiny little tea-leaf revelation. Keep it coming, Tetley! You've more than won me.

review/summary: Lemon and Licorice
review/text: "It may drive your cat crazy. But if you use it, it will probably have just the opposite effect on you. Catnip is a calming, safe, and mild sedative." ~ pg. 36 of God's Healing Herbs by Dennis Ellingson<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings has a few wellness teas for soothing your soul. Tension Tamer Extra has a lemony herbal flavor. Peppermint, cinnamon, lemongrass, lemon flavor, ginger root, licorice, vitamin C, B6, B12, Eleuthero, Chamomile, Tilia estrella, lemon verbena, catnip and roasted chicory make this earthy and lemony with calming power.<br /><br />Licorice is believed to have stress reducing properties and lemongrass makes this a lemony herb tea. Eleuthero, also known as "Siberian Ginseng" is a stress reliever but can also help improve concentration. This tea is not for children or for anyone with heart problems or high blood pressure.<br /><br />Tension Tamer Extra seems to have two effects, first it calms you down emotionally and then it wakes you up intellectually. This tea might be good to drink in the evening if you want to feel peaceful, but you are not quite ready to fall asleep. I find it clears my head and helps me to focus.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: This is a very unusual tea with a combination of flavors that I've never heard of before (peppermint, cinnamon, ginger, chamomile, lemongrass, licorice and more).  It smells divine and it tastes great.  I drink it everyday after work and through the evening.  It has added b vitamins to help with stress, and the ingrediants are also good for digestion (I originally bought this to help with digestive problems).  This tea becomes very addictive due to its unique flavor and smell.  My husband doesn't drink tea, but he loves the smell when I brew it.

review/text: I've always been prone to terrible headaches and frequently result to taking drugs of some sort to alleviate the pain. While I was in grad school a friend recommended that I try Tension Tamer tea. I was skeptical but like tea and decided to try it.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by its efficacy and have been drinking it for the past several years. I don't typically enjoy herbal teas and I don't really care for the flavor of this one (the chamomile is quite strong), however I don't drink it for the flavor, I drink it because most often it will reduce or eliminate my headache.

review/text: I really like this tea. I usually go for Sleepytime tea, but this one is a good change. It's flavor is a lot less subtle than Sleepytime's, but it's still relaxing without making me sleepy. It's very good for drinking while working on homework. I've also made iced tea with it using my iced tea maker. I used 10 bags, 1 qt of water, 1 qt of ice, and set it to "strong" (because it's herbal tea and needs more steeping time than black tea would need). It made a very refreshing tea that I can drink at night because there's no caffeine, which makes me happy.

review/summary: One of my favorite teas!
review/text: I initially bought this when I was going through some whacked out 'stress' and now I just buy it for the flavor. This really is so yummers with a bit of raw honey. The aroma is heavenly too! The ginger/citrus flavor is very comforting.<br /><br />From Celestial Seasoning's website:<br /><br />About the Tea<br />A traditional ginger tea with a tranquil twist from chamomile, eleuthero and B-vitamins.<br />100% Natural<br />This product contains all-natural herbs and flavors, and no artificial colors or preservatives.<br /><br />Ingredients: Eleuthero, peppermint, cinnamon, ginger, chamomile, West Indian lemongrass, licorice, catnip, tilia flowers, natural lemon flavor with other natural flavors (contains soy lecithin), hops and Vitamins B6 and B12.<br />------<br /><br />A little fascinating tidbits about "eleuthero" I found on the net:<br /><br />The constituents in eleuthero that have been most studied are the eleutherosides. Seven primary eleutherosides have been identified, with most of the research attention focusing on eleutherosides B and E. Eleuthero also contains complex polysaccharides (complex sugar molecules). These constituents may play a critical role in eleuthero's ability to support immune function.<br /><br />Eleuthero is an "adaptogen" (an agent that helps the body adapt to stress). It is thought to help support adrenal gland function when the body is challenged by stress.<br /><br />Eleuthero has been shown to enhance mental acuity and physical endurance without the letdown that comes with caffeinated products. Research has shown that eleuthero improves the use of oxygen by the exercising muscle. This means that a person is able to maintain aerobic exercise longer and recover from workouts more quickly. Preliminary research from Russia indicates it may be effective for this purpose. Other trials have been inconclusive or have shown no beneficial effect.<br /><br />Eleuthero may also support the body by helping the liver detoxify harmful toxins. It has shown a protective action in animal studies against chemicals such as ethanol, sodium barbital, tetanus toxoid, and chemotherapeutic agents. According to a test tube study eleuthero also helps protect the body during radiation exposure. Preliminary research in Russia has suggested that eleuthero may help alleviate side effects and help the bone marrow recover more quickly in people undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer.<br /><br />Eleuthero has been shown to be effective as a treatment for the common cold when combined with andrographis in a formula sometimes referred to as Kan Jang. Preliminary evidence also suggests that eleuthero may prove valuable in the long-term management of various diseases of the immune system, including HIV infection and chronic fatigue syndrome. Healthy people taking 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of tincture three times daily have been shown to have increased numbers of the immune cells (T4 lymphocytes) that have been found to decrease during HIV-infection and AIDS. Further human clinical trials are needed to confirm that eleuthero may be helpful for this disease.<br />How to Use It<br /><br />Dried, powdered root and rhizomes, 2 to 3 grams per day, are commonly used. Alternatively, 300 to 400 mg per day of concentrated solid extract standardized on eleutherosides B and E can be used, as can alcohol-based extracts, 8 to 10 ml in two to three divided dosages. Kan Jang is a formula combining an andrographis extract with an eleuthero extract providing 2 to 2.4 mg eleutherosides daily. Historically, eleuthero is taken continuously for six to eight weeks, followed by a one- to two-week break before resuming.<br /><br />Kinda cool, eh? :)

I opened the bx and the cats started sniffing the air and acting really interested in my tea (I had no idea there was catnip in it yet!). The tea itself is very tasty. Ginger and lemons with a peppermint twist. Quite good with a little bit of honey mixed in. I have been drinking it before bed every night since. I love it.

review/summary: Lovely non-fruity herbal tea.
review/text: This is one of my absolute favourite herbal tea blends, and I'm glad to be able to buy it in Australia. You can REALLY taste the catnip in this one and I have to have it in an airtight sealed container or my cat will get right into it.<br /><br />I don't really smell or taste cinnamon or giner personally, the siberian ginseng (Eleuthero) overwhelms most of the other flavours you'd expect this to taste of (lemon, ginger, cinnamon) and instead I find the aroma very grassy with slight lemon smell and the taste mostly chamomile and catnip.<br /><br />Overall I find this a lot nicer (read: less fruity/cloying) than most other blends on the market. I drink this sweetened with Stevia.

Don't want to return it and it's not so bad that I want to just toss it all away, but the flavor of this tea, which I think is really what helps relaxes you, just doesn't do it for me.

review/text: I have been dealing with stress every now and then. I went grocery shopping today looking for a new flavored tea to try and I came across Tension Tamer. I thought I would give this tea a shot since I really need something to help with my stress.. and it had some flavors in it that I love (lemon and peppermint)<br />When I got home I decided to make a cup right away since I had a pretty stressful day.. As soon as I poured hot water on the tea bag and took a whiff of the scented steam, it had a nice very soothing lemony scent! When I took the first sip I was amazed! I slowly with each sip started to become relaxed, it's incredible! This tea sure is a Tension Tamer! Although I don't taste peppermint, or licorice.. (maybe I'm brewing it wrong?) But this tea is fantastic I must say! Highly recommend it to people that suffer with stress and love lemon chamomile flavored teas! Tastes Great with honey in it too! :) Although I don't recommend this to cat owners since it has catnip in this tea, your cats may go crazy lol

review/summary: Tea is good, order fulfilment was not
review/text: This was my 5th or 6th order of the 6-box pack of Tension Tamer. Never had a problem with a single order until today. Advertised as 6 boxes of 20 bags each. WELL! Not only is the price today about $2 less than what I was charged two days ago -  I received only 5 out of 6 boxes? Hmmmm. Hoping Amazon Customer Service comes through with a shipment of that extra box of tea that I paid for. If not, Amazon will be losing a good, regular customer. As for the tea itself, it does not relieve "tension" (a Shiatsu massage will). It does, however, appear to promote relaxation and impart a sense of calm with every sip. You'll get over the slightly stinky smell in a few cups. The taste will grow on you.<br /><br />UPDATE (one day later): Amazon has notified me that they have shipped a free box of tea! Now THAT is good customer service. Thanks, Amazon! I'll be sticking around! :-)

review/summary: Would be better without the peppermint
review/text: Chaomomille tea is always my drink of choice at the end of the day because of its calming effects that last well into the night and next day.  While at the grocery store, I saw the tension tamer and thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />I use 3 tea bags in the pot, so after one cup of the tea I am pretty much super relaxed and through for the night.  The tea tastes alright, but the combination with the peppermint makes it taste funny.  Fortunately, I don't drink calming teas for the taste so it doesn't bother me.  Also, I use Splenda in the tea after it is through boiling so it tastes bearable.

review/summary: Lemon Fresh Pine Sol
review/text: This tea tastes like Lemon Fresh Pine Sol.  Or at least, it smells like Lemon Fresh Pine Sol, and it tastes the way it smells.  I guess I can't actually say it tastes like Pine Sol since I've never actually drank Pine Sol.  I gave it one star for tasting like an industrial grade cleaning solution, and one more since it deserves credit for not burning my throat the way I assume true cleaning solvents would.  On the plus side, though, it has catnip in it so if you have hyper cats, it might relax them.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: Well, I guess I should have read the description better, but I didn't see the warning about the color of these 'oozing eyes' being only on the plastic bag that each piece is in.  The candy itself is a plain white marshmallow.  They taste pretty disgusting, too.  The combination of them not looking anything remotely like an eye (even in the plastic bag you have to know that they are meant to be eyes) and tasting bad makes this a pretty useless candy for halloween.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I love almost all Campbell's creamed soups and this is no exception.  It is loaded with asparagus bits and actually  tastes like asparagus.  The salt content is still ridiculously high so I have to limit the salt content in my foods for the rest of the day.  I don't use this particular soup in cassaroles or on veges or even chicken like I do with all the other creamed soup types because this is just so delicious on its own.  I've tried many other brands of Asparagus soups and none can compare to this one so far.  If you can tolerate the high salt content, I highly recommend you give this variety of creamed soup a try.

review/summary: Thanks Amazon
review/text: My 87 year old mother loves this soup, too-she has 1/2 can everyday for lunch. Recently supermarkets in our area stopped carrying it-I find it hard to believe it was due to lack of sales. Decided to see if I could purchase thru Amazon-luckily they have a nice package deal & I set up for the subscription every month (which works out price-wise to what I was paying in store). My sister called Campbells directly & they told her of a supermarket which was still carrying it but was about 25 miles away!! Thanks for coming to our rescue, Amazon. I'll be getting my first shipment soon.

review/summary: A good basic for quick meals or as an ingredient
review/text: This is one of those classic canned products that is handy to keep in the pantry either for a quick easy meal on its own (and great when you're sick), or as an ingredient to make sauces or other things.  It is tasty by itself, or with additions such as other vegetables, meats, etc.<br /><br />I actually have a question though and hope someone might know:  How many servings of vegetables does this product have (either per serving, or for the full can)?<br /><br />I found one unclear reference on a website that markets this product in catering sized batches, but all it said was 1/2 cup of the soup, followed list-style by two phrases:  (1) under 250 calories; and (2) serving of vegetables.  I took that to mean that one serving of the prepared soup provides one serving of vegetables.  Does that sound about right?  The soup doesn't seem to contain quite that many chunks of asparagus to me; but maybe there is some pureed into the mix.<br /><br />Anyway - it's good!

review/text: I eat this as it is with a piece of bread. But my favorite use is as a base for more soup. I like to add a small amount of water & some milk & set this aside. Then I add cooked potatoes & asparagus & other veggies to the base and heat thruogh. I serve with a sandwich or salad or a piece of crusty bread & a small salad. Delicious! But it all starts with the canned soup. Great!

review/summary: Delicious, but dangerous.
review/text: I bought these because I saw a friend eating them the other day, and I remembered how much I loved them.  They are absolutely delicious.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*They are individually wrapped, so they stay fresh for longer.<br />*The bag is resealable also, so they don't spill all over the place when the cats start knocking it over (which they will).<br />*2lbs is a ton of these, so you'll certainly satisfy your sweet tooth.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*2lbs is a ton of these.  Eat them all and you WILL be sick.<br />*All the little wrappers generate a lot of trash.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Besides the fact that they are tasty, they remind me of someone very special, and whenever I start to miss her, they make me happy.  They get a star for that alone. :)

review/summary: High quality candy
review/text: These are made by Jelly Belly and have the same high quality ingredients as their jelly beans and are very nicely flavored with real fruit juices and purees. There are no artificial flavors and no harsh aftertastes, just the satisfying flavor of real fruit. The consistency is also spot-on, they are soft and not overly sticky like a lot of fruit slice type candy. I would describe them as having a more soft and jelly like consistency then Jelly Belly brand jelly beans.<br /><br />The 2 pound bag I ordered from Amazon was as fresh as could be and there was an equal mix of lime, lemon, grapefruit, and raspberry, but not a lot of orange. I'm sure the mix differs with each batch and my lack of orange isn't a big enough deal to give this great candy any less than 5 stars.

I assumed this lime other's said was missing would be green so I was so sad when I got my bag of candy and there was no white gems in it :( Why oh why did you take the Lime away?

review/text: These are probably the closest you can get to eating a candy that tastes like real fruit. I don't know why the Sunkist Fruit Gems were taken off the open market. My grand kids love these. They would rather have a couple of these then cookies or ice cream. The only problem is that they go fast & the only way I can get more is to order them on line. I sure don't mind paying for them I just don't like the fact that I have to pay for shipping. If the candy company would put them back on the open market we could get them whenever we wanted & not have to wait for them to be shipped to us. Over all these are really a great tasting candy & it only takes a couple to satisfy that sugar craving. Gigi <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PA1AVG">Sunkist Fruit Gems 2 Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: A Little Pricey But For Myself Feel It's Worth It
review/text: Like many other reviewers have written this candy has been difficult to get from stores as most no longer carry the candy which is real inconvenient,  but now I can get as much as I want here and with fast delivery(Amazon Prime) it makes it very convenient for myself now  though I wish the price was a little lower though.  The candies are a true joy though if you're still uncertain I'd advise buying a smaller bag first to try out and then decide on if you want to upgrade to the larger bags.  While the container bag has a zip lock to keep from spilling and keep the candy fresh each candy is individually wrapped as well so regardless if you keep the container bag zipped or not the candy will still stay fresh.
