review/text: I bought this for my Maltese and Schnauzer, and they both love it. I wish it came in a smaller size, though. It's a little on the large size for the Maltese. Don't get me wrong. He loves it and eats all of it, but it would be nice to have the option of a smaller size. That's the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five.

review/text: Love these little shells.  They are perfect for my toddler.  We have no problems with the texture or with them crumbling, as I read in another review.  I am no longer able to find them locally, and have taken to ordering them on Amazon rather than switch to something else. As with much of the whole grain pasta I use, I have taken to adding a bit of olive oil to the cooking water to prevent sticking once they are drained.  Have not really found sticking to be a problem with these shells, though, even without the oil.  They're great!

review/summary: Pop Rocks Dips Blue Raspberry
review/text: Almost 30 years after I first heard ridiculous stories about Pop Rocks, I still think they're some of the coolest candy ever.  Pop Rocks didn't kill Mikey.  Mixing Pop Rocks and soda won't lead to exploding child, although s/he might burp something wicked (but burping's kind of fun when you're young enough to be amused by it.  Or if you're male).<br /><br />Pop Rocks aren't about the flavors, much.  As long as they taste like sugar - and they still do - that's good enough, because Pop Rocks are all about the pop - and they still do that, too.  One attraction is surely opening your mouth wide, with food inside (!), so you and your friends can listen to the noise unhindered.  Close your mouth and get the full impact, because you can actually feel the popping.<br /><br />Some things, the small amusements in life, never change, although 1983 began a bleak period in the lives of Pop Rocks fans when they disappeared from store shelves.  1985 brought them back as "Action Candy", but we all knew.  It's been good to have them back under their proper name, because no childhood can possibly be complete until you've had your friends listen to your mouth.<br /><br />Blue Raspberry's not a bad flavor, but the "Dips" part is a little deceptive, if you take the package at face value.  The sucker looks huge, and it isn't.  It's thinner than you think, and way smaller than the picture on the packaging suggests.  Not that a seven year old is going to complain or even notice.  The only negative is that, like many fun foods (junk foods, snack foods), the packaging is mostly empty.  Still, worth the price for the trip back in time and the chance to freak your own little one out!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

Cooking with olive oil is healthy, and these flavored oils make it easy to add variety to a meal - just put freshly cut veggies into a microwave-safe bowl, drizzle with one of the oils, and microwave a few minutes to have a healthy and delicious meal.  They also make great gifts - consider taking this in lieu of a bottle of wine the next time you are invited to a friend's home for dinner.

review/text: My wife & I try to eat healthy chip snacks but most of them are relatively expensive.  We switched over to making our own popcorn for an economical alternative... and this particular brand is top notch.  Pops super even and very little burned even if cooked well done, even if large amounts cooked at once.  We cook ours in a 3 gallon stainless All-Clad pan over gas heat and it's always wonderful.  Weve been through several bags so far and yet to have an issue.  We use sunflower seed oil, and as it just starts to pop we add tblsp butter & tblsp ghee... shake and pop a bit... bout half popped salt a little... when done wipe the condensation from inside the lid, salt a little, cover & let cool, fill up 2 gallon ziplock & start over.  Perfect cheap snack<br /><br />GREAT STUFF!!

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I'm a self-professed popcorn junkie, and am pretty much addicted to the stuff.  Over the years, I've tried a lot of different popcorn; from microwave popcorn, to air-popped.  A little over a year ago, I happened across the "Wabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper" here on Amazon.  Very cool gadget, let me tell ya!  Since then, I've been on a quest for the perfect popcorn to compliment the Whirley Pop.  As I get older, I'm beginning to appreciate the more "natural" popcorn varieties, and I suppose that's what attracted me to the Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Popcorn.<br /><br />I'm no "organic" food expert.  I just wanted some good tasting popcorn.  And, I feel like that's what I got.  Using the Whirley Pop, with a very small amount of oil, I've had great results.  I was concerned by some of the reviews stating they were seeing a substantial number of unpopped kernels.  This hasn't been my experience to-date.  I'd say the pop-rate is on par or better than any other variety of corn I've tried.<br /><br />As for taste, it tastes like what you'd think "plain" popcorn should taste like.  Light, fluffy, and very good.  I think, perhaps, a lot of folks associate "natural" popcorn with air-popped popcorn, and I don't know that that's a fair comparison.  Air-popped popcorn has always tasted sort of...rubbery, to me.  Using the Whirly-pop, you still get that great popcorn "CRUNCH", but without the extra fat, salt, and who know's what is added to microwave popcorns.<br /><br />Perhaps that's the beauty of Arrowhead Mills popcorn.  All natural out of the box.  The sky is the limit when it comes to "fancying" it up.  Want butter, and salt?  No problem!  Prefer your popcorn plain?  Easy as pie.  The point is, you are in total control of what, if anything, is added to your popcorn.  As someone who likes to occasionally indulge in some *real* butter on my popcorn, this is a nice change of pace as compared to the sickly "butter" that many big-name manufactures use.<br /><br />Give this stuff a try.  For the money, I think it's a good, healthy choice.

review/text: We have been using an air popper for quite awhile, and have found it hard to find popcorn that doesn't just fall into the bowl without first popping.  This popcorn never fails to pop, and you get a very large bowl of it (we used to only get a few handfuls with the store bought brands).  If you love popcorn without all the calories, this is the stuff to get!

review/summary: Organic!
review/text: We prefer organic popcorn and this is by far the best we have found.  Like other reviewers, we have had a problem with bags opening during shipment, and have talked to Customer Service about it.  Our last order came in better packaging and all six bags were intact.<br /><br />There is some inconsistency in quality, but we have never had a truly bad batch.  All of the bags were within "best by" dates, so can only guess as to the reason.<br /><br />We've popped this popcorn in several different types of poppers:<br /><br />Microwave, using a Presto microwave popper (with the somewhat hard-to-get concentrators).  Pops up very well but does leave quite a few unpopped.  Let those settle to the bottom of the bowl and enjoy the rest.  Do need to be careful near the end of the batch - dentists love unpopped popcorn.<br /><br />Stovetop, using a WhirlyPop.  Pops very well in the aluminum ones.  Only problems have been with the Whirlypop and a tendency for popped kernels to get stuck under the stiring rod and burn.<br /><br />In an electric popper (another Presto, but the West Bend should work fine too).  Excellent results here - almost all pop and taste great.  Must confess to using a little more oil than the manufacturer recommends.<br /><br />In summary, this is a very good organic popcorn.  It is as good or better than the other organic popcorns we've tried (better than most) and quite reasonably priced with the subscription.

review/summary: Popcorn as it should be- free of Frankenfood and pops nicely
review/text: I recently learned about GMOs- genetically modified organisms, which is a technical way of saying food with added genes from bacteria or a virus or who knows what! And corn, from my research, is almost 95% guaranteed to be GMO unless you buy certified organic. Even then, it's possible for crops to become contaminated which is scary!<br /><br />I have been using Arrowhead Mills products since the late 1980s (and did not know until now that they were purchased by Hain) but this product was new to me. I was pleasantly surprised at how much better it is than the standard fare. When popped in a hot air popper:<br /><br />1) The kernels are large, fluffy, crunchy<br />2) They didn't explode all over my kitchen floor like the others I've tried<br />3) Out of two ounces of kernels I had only a few unpopped kernels.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied and highly recommend this popcorn for good eating and peace of mind if you want to avoid GMOs.

review/text: This is a really good popcorn at an excellent price.<br /><br />Organic, which is a great big plus for me, and bears the USDA seal, so it is also GMO free. Doesn't pop as large as some, but there are very few un-popped kernels.<br /><br />The only negative at all for me is that the taste is slightly bland.<br /><br />Well worth a try. I'll be buying more.

review/text: I used this for the first time last night.  The order arrived quickly.  I popped 2 cups of raw kernels on a popper that is a metal pot you put on a stove, with a crank that you need to turn while it is popping.  Did it with corn oil.  it was for a party at church, once a month with jiffy pop brand in the past with the same popper and same proportion of corn and oil.<br /><br />1.  Lots cheaper than grocery store price, and it was delivered quickly.<br /><br />2. taste was judged to be as good or better.<br /><br />3. more bulk and less waste than with Jiffy pop brand.

review/summary: Great, fresh popcorn!
review/text: I've purchased single bags of Arrowhead Mills popcorn for years. But, with respect to freshness, I was concerned about purchasing from Amazon after reading some of the reviews here, particularly in quantity.<br /><br />I checked the expiry date immediately upon receipt--the six bags had dates for March of next year, which was acceptable to me--and made a quick batch. It produced large, fluffy popcorn, which immediately disappeared!<br /><br />Highly recommended if you can consume a bag in approximately a week to ten days. After that, like most popping corn exposed to air, this brand tends to produced a lesser volume of popcorn.

review/summary: Organic Popcorn
review/text: This is the second time I have ordered this popcorm from Amazon and my wife and I really love it. As you may know, corn in general is LOADED with pesticides.<br />In addition, Monsanto is destroying the world with their GMO products which makes their corn resistant to the pesticide (also made by Monsanto) called Round-up. So once their corn is planted, it can be drenched in Round-up to kill the weeds and the corn still grows. I don't want to be consuming Round-up when I eat.  Nice huh? Sorry for the sidetrack.  Just sayin.  My point is, it was critical for me that the popcorn be organic for me to even eat any corn period.  This popcorn is not only delicious, it is at an outstanding price of less than $1.45 a pound.  With this purchase, you get 10.5 pounds of popcorn.  I couldn't find a cheaper organic popcorn than this one.  If somebody does, please contact me.  Once last thing, use Organic Coconut Oil if you want an extra healthy treat.  Coconut oil handles the high heat necessary in making popcorn and is also extremely healthy for you. Tastes great. Don't even need butter.

review/summary: Taste is fine, but only 50% pops
review/text: Taste is typical of popcorn, but when the kernels pop in my air popper, they are so forceful that they push unpopped kernels out the chute. In the end of popping, about 50% of unpopped kernels have gone unpopped. This makes this popcorn twice as expensive. My local co-op organic popcorn pops so nice and is a good price (just far from my house), I am regretting ordering this product in bulk. Bad mistake :(  I will take the drive into town and get the co=ops popcorn over this brand in the future...

review/text: I just tried this popcorn in my hot air popper. I put in the same half cup amount that I do with my regular popcorn but the Arrowhead Mills popcorn popped bigger and fuller so much so that it overflowed the bowl. There were only 5 unpopped kernels in the batch and no large pieces of hull to get stuck between your teeth. It's good enough to eat plain but if you add a little salt and melted butter you have perfection. A superior product. I will order again.

review/summary: Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Popcorn is crisp, light and very tasty!
review/text: This Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Popcorn is a great buy and is top-of-the-line, terrific popcorn! I love it. Plus..... it is ORGANIC!<br /><br />The instructions said that, if it doesn't pop very well, put it in the refrigerator for a couple of days in order to add moister to the kernels. So..... I figured, what the heck, and I put a bag of popcorn into the refrig. I don't know how much it helped, or didn't help, but the results were great!<br /><br />It is so tasty that I often eat it without salting it, or without adding butter or any other flavoring. It is that good!<br /><br />Update: May 3, 2012; I've ordered this organic popping popcorn time after time and each time it has been top quality. Pops full, tasty and crisp. The recent negative comments do make me a little cautious, but I am ordering it again today. Hopefully, when I get it, it will be the same high quality, tasty popcorn that I am used to getting.<br /><br />Update: May 8, 2012; Got the popcorn yesterday. Same great popcorn! Pops fluffy and crispy. At the end of popping, there are a few unpopped kernels. So, I empty the popped popcorn and then put the popper back in the microwave and pop the remaining kernels for another 45 seconds, which just about pops all the remaining kernels.

review/summary: Excellent popcorn!
review/text: I was hesitant about ordering this product based on some ho-hum reviews, but I am so pleased that I did!<br /><br />Finally, I am able to make some microwave popcorn without all the fat and salt, and with assurances that it is USDA Certified Organic!  I used about a teaspoon of coconut oil with about 1/2 cup of popcorn, and made it in the plastic microwave popper sold here on Amazon.  Just that 1/2 cup made a gigantic bowl of popcorn that was probably twice the amount you get in the typical microwave bags.  It makes you realize with a slap in the face how much you've been paying for so long, to get so little!  Doing it this way takes only about two minutes longer than the convenient bags, but you get twice as much at a very small fraction of the price!!<br /><br />Honestly, I am not wild about the coconut oil on the popcorn.  I will probably continue to use it, because of the health benefits of coconut oil, and maybe I'll get used to it in a short time.  If not, I'll consider using nothing or perhaps canola oil or light olive oil.  I just don't know if I can get used to that slightly coconut-y flavor on the popcorn.  And it does add a slight oily-ness too, that I'm not crazy about.  I like my popcorn dry and unsalted, or sometimes with just a tiny bit of sea salt.  If I find, as some have stated in reviews, that a little oil is necessary to get good pops, then perhaps I will spring for a jar of ghee in my local healthfood store. (For those who aren't familiar with ghee, it is clarified butter... they skim off the solids once the butter is melted.  It has a higher smoke point and is loaded with fat!  It is also pretty expensive, although you could make it yourself at home.)  At least the slight oily-ness would have a buttery flavor instead of one that really doesn't complement the popcorn, in my opinion.  I'm sure you could make an entire bowl of popcorn with about 1/8 of a teaspoon of ghee, so the high price and high fat content might be worth the taste.<br /><br />There were some unpopped kernels in the bottom of the bowl, but honestly not that many.  There weren't any "half-popped" ~ which I find yummy but they're probably not good for my digestive tract anyway, so I won't miss them.  If you compared the number of unpopped kernels in my bowl to what you'd find in two bags of commercial microwave popcorn, it would probably be about the same.  So I have nothing to complain about.<br /><br />The popcorn was yummy, and now that I have a truly organic, salt free, low fat snack that's full of fiber, I will be eating popcorn a lot more often.  I have stocked up on it, and when it's gone I'll stock up again.  I'd better be sure to also stock up on dental floss, otherwise my dentist might not be too happy with me at my next cleaning appointment.<br /><br />Thumbs up!!!<br />(Slight warning on the plastic microwave bowl though... it gets EXTREMELY hot and stays hot for a while after you take it out of the microwave!  Use potholders to hold it, or you'll burn your hands like I did... I expected it to have cooled down a bit, but no...)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W4UP">Nordic Ware 60120 Microwaver Popcorn Popper 12 Cup</a><br /><br />Addition January 2012:  I just ordered my second half dozen batch.  I finally figured out the perfect way to make this popcorn, and it has become a staple snack.  I keep the coconut in the fridge, and use a knife to shave off a few pieces to pop a bowl.  Perfect combo is 1/3 cup corn and a few shavings of oil... perfect bowl of popped corn!  The teaspoon I was using in the beginning was too much... that was why my batch was oily and too "coconutty" at first.  Just a few shavings is plenty to pop it, and gives it just a very slight coconut taste (which is delicious).

review/text: I eat popcorn almost every day.  I was disappointed in this one.  It wasn't out of date, as the code date is a year away, but the kernels were tough and had a lot of solid bits in them.  I use a Whirley Pop popper.  2/3 of a cup of good quality unpopped kernels will usually fill it up.  That didn't happen with the Arrowhead.<br /><br />Pop Secret has generally been good for me in the moderate priced range.  For only a bit more per pound than the Arrowhead, I've had good results from Bob's Red Mill Corn Popcorn White, 27-Ounce (Pack of 4).  I'll be going back to Bob's and try to remember not to order Arrowhead in the future when I'm trying to save money.

review/summary: Yum, no GMO's
review/text: I have subscribed to automatic delivery every three months after going through the first order in record popcorn eating time.  I abhor the smell of microwave popcorn since the popcorn production plants were forced (rightfully so) to change their butter flavor formula after an ingredient was found responsible for health problems in popcorn plant workers.  That all unfolded in the 2000's and presumably micro-popcorn is safe, but eeyew!, what a stink.  So back to old fashioned popping on the stove top.  Since the jarred popcorn at the grocery store are ridiculously priced and are not organic, I needed a fix.<br /><br />  This popcorn has flavor and  pop's great (so far. . .I believe other reviewers who have had problems with freshness.  Sooner or later, someone gets the junk from the bottom of the tank or back of the truck).  I've had to learn how to make this (much higher heat than I would have thought, and don't skimp too much on the oil because of the fat), but I've got it down now.  Oh, and I also learned how to make it in the micro using lunch size paper bags. I squirt a quick spray of oil canola  in the bag, put in about a 1/4 cup corn kernels, roll the edge about three times and cook it on high for about three minutes.  I don't have children in the house but it's got to be safer than letting make it on a burner, especially when you're not watching. The yield isn't as high as on the stove top, but my built-in microwave oven surprisingly lacks some wattage.  I no longer have an electric popcorn maker, since I'm burned out on one use appliances cluttering up the kitchen,  At the rate I go through popcorn, I may give in, but I hate washing the darn things.  Oh, heck, who enjoys washing almost anything, it's just what has to be done.

review/text: I was so excited to be getting organic popcorn, because I want to get away from GMO foods.  This popcorn is horrible, though.  We pop it in an air popper, and over half of the kernels are hard, and only partially or not popped.  My husband didn't know that I had bought a new kind of popcorn, and as he was eating it said "What is wrong with this popcorn!  It's horrible!"<br /><br />I agree.  I will definitely buy something different next time.

review/text: The organic popcorn itself is great, however, as I've gotten to the bottom of my bags of popcorn, I realized I was actually sent a bag that had been opened and they decided to ship me the bag of popcorn, with the kernels that fell out, placed inside another plastic bag, simply taped back up. This is completely unacceptable, being an edible item. I paid for new, sealed popcorn kernels, not opened, tampered with kernels. Extremely disappointed in Amazon for this. WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN and has me now leery of all other products I order.

review/text: This popcorn doesn't pop well. If I add 2x to 3x the oil and a lot of extra popcorn to the pan I get a full pot. Even then it takes forever to start popping and leaves a bunch of burnt kernels. As soon as I use up this order I'm switching back to the organic brand from my local co-op. It costs a little more but that's made up for with everything actually popping.

review/summary: Addictively good, but that's the problem...
review/text: Worthy of 2 stars because, quite honestly, this is probably the "best tasting" con queso dip I've tried among any supermarket brands out there.<br /><br />Not worthy of more because I recently decided to read the label and was shocked to find WHY it's so "great tasting" and incredibly addictive at that, sure it doesn't have "MSG" in the list of ingredients, but it DOES have "Maltodextrin", "Modified Corn Starch", "Spices", "Natural Flavor", all of which are controversial, Maltodextrin commonly creates free glutamates, Modified Corn Starch is pretty much used exclusively for that purpose ("modified" by processing to free the glutamates), and of course "Spices" and "Natural Flavor" are most commonly known as just another way of labeling MSG without having to actually put "MSG" on the label.<br /><br />Shame on any food maker that loads up foods with heavy amounts of free glutamates, poisoning us all with addictive neurotoxins just to turn a profit.<br /><br />Further shame on any food maker that does so and then has the cojones to dare say "No MSG" as part of marketing that product.<br /><br />And honestly, I can't understand for the life of me why this comes from On The Border, makers of one of the only good Salsa's on the market that actually DOESN'T contain any of these controversial ingredients! How about creating a spin-off of this product with all the neurotoxic free glutamates removed from the mix so people who care about their health and mental well-being can enjoy one of the best tasting con queso's on the market, without worrying about any adverse side effects?

review/summary: Good snack, but Amazon packaging is too much!
review/text: A huge brown box, heavily sealed with plastic tape, just came.  I carved off the tape.  Inside, I found air pillows and a smaller but still quite large package that had been labeled "Ready to Ship" after shrink wrapping.  Under the shrink wrap there were two smaller boxes that had zip perforations to make them easy to open, but these had been taped over with the strong plastic tape so I had to hack in with my scissors.  Inside each I found six cardboard boxes of the rice snax.  Opening one of these boxes, I found a sealed foil pouch.  Fortunately, that was not hard to open.  The crackers are oniony and tasty, and I am happy to find a way to get the gluten-free stuff I need at a volume price, but now I have all this cardboard to put into recycling.  A single cardboard box to hold 12 pouches inside would have been fine.  Amazon, you can help save the planet by reducing all this packaging.  I repeat - the crackers are crispy and good, and will get me through the holidays in style, but so much packaging!

review/text: These crackers taste good.  They are smaller and thinner than I thought they'd be, but my kids like them.  They do have a strong onion and garlic flavor, so be prepared for that.  One thing I was disappointing in was the yeast extract ingredient.  It makes the crackers have the stronger salty onion garlic flavor, but it falls under the food additive list similar to MSG (monosodium glutamate).  I'm trying to keep my kids away from certain food additives, but now I have 12 boxes of these crackers to go through.  I let them eat them once in a while.

review/summary: Another terrible dog food hits the market
review/text: Just because your dog likes it doesn't mean it is good for you. I love In and Out burger but I know better then to make a regular diet of it.<br /><br />Meat by products is high on the ingredient list and is a terrible ingredient. If a manufacturer had nothing to hide, they would list the specific animal that makes up the meat content. Plus, the meat is marked "by-products", which is throwaway parts unusable for anything else and of the lowest quality in nutrients. Wheat, corn, and soy are also part of the ingredient list and among the worst offenders when it comes to allergies in dogs. They are among the most difficult things for dogs to digest. Please do yourself and your dog a favor by feeding them a higher quality product. Review the ingredient list and doing a little research on ingredients will go a long way towards a longer and healther life for your dog.

review/summary: amazing cat food
review/text: I work with a 501(c)3 non-profit cat rescue (fostering sick cats until they are well enough to go to forever homes).  I recently took in a kitty that someone had locked in their basement without food or water and left to die.  You could see every bone in her body.  While she was totally starving, convincing her to eat, or move, or drink, or clean herself was difficult.  I tried a variety of cat foods, but the only thing I could get her to eat was really expensive tuna from whole foods.  Then I tried Tiki Cat.  She loves it.  And I love it because it has the nutrition she needs (which plain tuna doesn't).  It is on the pricey side, but it is worth it for nutritious food that will save this kitties life.  I just ordered a 72-pack on Amazon - because buying it one can at a time at my local cat food store was getting pricey.

It seems to be a great product--prepared healthily, and the food speaks for itself--even smells good to a human.  The variety is brilliant--something for every kitty's palate, and good nourishment for those poor, unfortunate mewers who suffer from gastric upset/other problems.  It does seem to help with that, and there is not nearly so much hurling on the Tiki food.  Amazon gives a great deal on the 72-pack, with free shipping.  If that stays, then I will be ordering regularly.  Lucky cats who get to have this food!  But they all deserve the best from us humans.

It almost feels like crack cocaine should be listed as one of the ingredients. I do think that some of the recipes in this assortment are more successful than others -- sardine cutlets smell so good, I am tempted to deprive the cat of them and eat the big sardine pieces myself instead. But rice recipes and ahi tuna -- not so much. I get the medley to give the cat some variety in his diet, but I can't say he loves all of them equally and sardine recipes seem to be the most popular with him.

review/summary: My Cat Loves This!
review/text: I was kind of hesitant to buy this based on the reviews, but I needed a cat food to give my baby variety.  She is odd. One day she likes kibble, the next day she wants wet.  I had been using the Life's Abundance and she loves that kibble, but she has a love/hate relationship with their wet food.  I think the texture of the food is too dense for her to eat.  She licks it more than gobbles and sometimes she cleans the bowl and other times she leaves it to rot.<br /><br />With this she likes every flavor and cleans the bowl all the time.  I only wish they would make something that had beef/chicken or liver to make sure she gets a well rounded diet.  Her doctor recommended that I start giving her more meat/meat based diet.<br /><br />But otherwise I think this is a good food if her appetite is any indication.

review/summary: these cookies take the cake!
review/text: I just love these cookies - the texture is somewhere between a sugar cookie and shortbread but with a nice buttery note that is unlike either of the others. The best I could describe the flavor is sort of like pound cake, but in crisp cookie form. Perfect with tea, coffee, milk or even just by themselves. These are great to give as gifts during the holidays too; I've never met anyone young or old that didn't like them. They are well packaged with the little muffin liners so rarely a broken one and they keep for a really long time. The tin seals nice and tight and is reusable.<br /><br />My favorites are the ones topped with the sparkling sugar and it's a good thing there are four tins here because then I don't have to feel guilty about keeping all of the sugar-topped ones from *one* box for myself :)
