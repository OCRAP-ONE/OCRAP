review/summary: The Best Cleansing Tea I've Ever Had
review/text: I've used this brand for years. If you're feeling clogged up or ate a massive meal have a few sips of this tea.  If you're new to it make sure you're home because it can work a little too well if you know what I mean.  Just be careful the first couple of times using it and try little sips.  You'll see a result by morning or earlier if you follow it with lots of water.

review/text: This reminded me how much I enjoy Indian pickle.  It was basically good pickle.<br />Problems:<br />* it seemed a bit stale<br />* it was fairly pricey<br />But it did remind me that I really like Indian pickle, and told me that I could get it on the internet, so I poked around a bit and found a place (ishopindia.com) in another suburb of Chicago which was closer (Skokie; I live in Oak Park) so instead of it coming from Texas, it came from Skokie (less than an hour's drive away).  That solved the staleness problem.  Their prices seemed to be about 2/3 of Amazon's prices.  I thank Amazon for reminding me that I should look.

review/text: We drink this coconut water every day in our house. It's become somewhat of an obsession. We used to have a subscription to the 12 pack of vitacoco and when that ran out we tried this instead. I like it better. It tastes cleaner though I can't describe what's different about it, I just feel better after drinking this than drinking the vitacoco. Coconut water in general has an odd taste to it but it's still really sweet and feels SO refreshing when you drink it. If I'm really hungry I drink this between meals and it's kind of like a protein shake or energy drink. It settles my stomach and gives me a fantastic burst of energy!

review/text: -- If you buy this from Amazon, you'll be disappointed at the shipping.  My box of 12 came in one cardboard box, with the 12 container-boxes loosely in a plastic bag.  One was smashed, so leaking into the bag, two were dented, and one was coming open from the bottom due to the puddle of leaking water in the bag. I opened the bag, and it smelled awful from the rancid, leaking water. If Amazon wants to continue selling the 12-pack-33oz, it needs to package the shipping better. [NOTE, however, I was able to Live-Chat with Amazon and get a refund, even though the item is a "non-returnable grocery item".]<br />-- AND, review of the drink:  The drink itself is SUPERIOR to the taste of Vita-Coca("good") or Zico(too sweet), so as a drink, the O.N.E, really IS like drinking from a real coconut out in the tropics.  I am going back to the individual single-serve containers of O.N.E., shipped from Amazon.<br />-- AND, In a second comparison, the multi-pack of Vita-Coca-33oz comes SUPERBLY packaged in the shipping box from Amazon (as EACH 33oz container is invidually protected in a cardboard sleeve).<br />-- Hope that helps (and, Thank you Amazon for letting me have a refund on the damaged box, but it will be more helpful if you can protect the boxes better for shipping it to us).

review/summary: All-around refreshment.
review/text: As I ordered a 12 pack of O.N.E. Coconut Water, I remember thinking "Twelve? What on earth am I going to do with 12 of them?".  An easy way to get potassium was what I was looking for, but when I took my first sip I was hooked!  Not only is this loaded with the potassium I needed for my nightly leg cramps, it has a mild, pleasant flavor. Talk about refreshing; I can't wait for summer now!  There is an instant cooling sensation, a pleasant, smooth mouth-feel, and a thirst quenching ability you wish a soda had.  I've tried other brands, but they come across as "raw" or harsh; for me O.N.E. is the V.S.O.P. of coconut waters (to me, that means the best).  My shipment arrived earlier than expected and was in perfect shape.  If you want electrolytes in a delicious, healthy form, this is your stuff. As far as my hesitancy on ordering a twelve pack... there'll be an order for another twelve pack arriving soon!

review/summary: ONE Coconut Water - Love / Hate Relationship
review/text: My wife really loves O.N.E Coconut Water.  I thought via auto ship would be a great way not to have to go to the store every other day to get some.  I ordered 6 cases of 12 ea.  The first problem occurred when case number one was sent back as undeliverable.  I guess a San Diego address would be undeliverable in Kentucky.  Of the 5 remaining cases all of which did arrive but in not great condition.  All the cases were still sealed but 1 had 2 of the 33.8 ounce boxes split open and there were 3 other boxes in other cases that were stale (really had a rancid smell).  Therefore I cancelled the auto ship and have gone back to picking this up in the local supermarket.  Works out better, just more time consuming and heavier.  It would have been nice knowing that the cases were in fact pretty flimsy.  My wife still loves the product.

review/text: First off, I didn't purchase this product through Amazon, but at a local grocery store, so my review only reflects the product itself, not Amazon in any way.  I bought this last week never having tried coconut water before, but I heard good things.  The taste of it was almost like the smell of lawn clippings that had been damp and out in the sun for a long time.  Tasted off and had a faint mold smell to it.  I didn't know if it was supposed to taste like that or not as I never tried it before, but paying as much as I did I felt obligated to finish it off.  I've been ill for about a week after drinking it.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or the cause of it.  I did email customer service at O.N.E. the day I drank it asking if it was supposed to taste like that or if I got a bad batch, and they still haven't replied to me.

review/summary: The best, but not in price
review/text: I've tried several brands and this is true to the taste of fresh coconut water, though slightly more dilute.  The "wholesale" price here doesn't make much sense to me.  It's about $5.75 per liter in an 12 pack.  I get it for $4.99 at Publix.  The only disadvantage is that they only have maybe 4 or 5 at a time, but I'm one of few buying it and I sweep the shelves of it (LOL).<br />  I'm 37 weeks pregnant and this helps decrease the swelling in my legs and keeps me well hydrated.  I don't experience any leg cramps like I did during my first pregnancy.  I think the potassium makes a huge difference.  And with a tendency towards gestational diabetes, the low sugar content vs. other sports drinks is a huge advantage.  They should market this directly to pregnant women with diabetes (with no renal issues).

review/text: I love this product. I wanted something healthy and good tasting that didn't have added sugar or chemical sweeteners as an alternate to water. This is it. I like this coconut water better than others I have tried. It isn't as sweet as the Amy & Brian brand, which I prefer. I do not use sugar so I found this brand to be the best. The taste has also been consistent since starting my use of this in April. I have purchased four cases since June 2012. It also has a lot of health benefits.

review/summary: I HATE coconut BUT
review/text: This was not bad at all. I had a bad experience with VitaCoco acai and pomegranate and it was horrible!!! It had that strong coconut flavor that I do not like. I had already bought this so I was nervous to try it. I was surprised when it barely tasted like coconut. It doesn't have that typical strong coconut taste. I usually stay away from anything coconut. Candy, food, beverages, etc. For some reason it gets me sick. But I wanted to try this, because I heard coconut water is good for you. I already tried the mango, pineapple, and pink guava flavors. They are delicious. Pink guava is my favorite. O.N.E. brand is my favorite. As long as I don't really taste that strong coconut flavor, then I will keep drinking this.

review/summary: Sweet and natural tasting
review/text: I have tried three brands of coconut water and this is my favorite.  It is sweet, but naturally so.  Unfortunately the price is a bit high for me.  If it becomes available as a subscription and/or the price lowers, I will switch back to it.  I tried Zico and found it to be a bit sour and bitter for my taste.  I am using Roland cans now.  It is not as healthy as it has sugar and water added, but I love the coconut bits and the taste is good and the price is right.

review/summary: HORRIBLE TASTING, Unnaturally Formed Chip
review/text: I bought these for my vegan father who LOVES the curry kale chips by Rhythm Superfoods (my 22 month old daughter, husband and I also like them)!<br /><br />Thought I would give him a new kale chip flavor--BBQ--as part of his Christmas gift. Although a different brand than we typically eat, they sounded good. First, I was disappointed to see these chips are not kale in its natural curly form but pressed into round, dog-snack-looking discs. Luckily I tried them before giving them. I spit it right out! Was it just me? My husband also tried one and couldn't finish even one chip.<br /><br />I have a pack of 4 that cannot be returned... what a waste of food and money!

review/summary: I Still Like It Despite The Problems.....
review/text: As another reviewer noted when you heat this product in the microwave, you MUST keep an eye on it.  It tips; it pops and eventually spills all over.  However, if you keep an eye on this product, stirring it every 20-30 seconds of the 2-3 minute heating period, you can avoid the spilling and tipping, ect.  Also the noodles do puddle at the bottom once you complete the soup but I usually keep a spoon nearby so I can at least finish the soup and not waste it.  Simple fact of gravity I guess but even stiring frequently can't seem to prevent this from occurring.<br /><br />Despite these problems, I give this product 5 stars.  I do this because it is more a convenience than a nuisance.  With lower sodium than the regular type of soup (this product is still 730mg of sodium, 30% of the recommended daily value) and an easy to go container make it a good to go snack.  Comparing the price per each on Amazon vs. a local store finds it much cheaper here on Amazon.  I recommend this product but ask you head my suggestions to avoid the problems that appear to affect others too.

review/summary: Pasty noodle mash at the end of serving
review/text: Every time I heated this particular soup in any microwave, the container made a popping sound and popped up off the turning tray, fell over, and spilled out. If you can catch it before it spills over completely, you will find when eating that the noodles all gravitate to the bottom and you are left with a very untasty, pasty noodle mash at the end of the serving.

review/summary: Forever Fruit is my forever favorite
review/text: After trying different citrusy flavors of gum (including Orbit Citrus Mint, Orbit Sangria Fresca, Orbit Fabulous Frutini, Extra Fruit Sensations Island Cooler, Trident Tropical Twist, and Stride Always Mandarin), I have concluded that Stride Forever Fruit takes the crown.<br /><br />There is a real burst of flavor (and natural-tasting sweetness) as you pop a piece in your mouth, and although it doesn't last "forever," it definitely holds its own against each of the flavors mentioned above.<br /><br />Feel free to conduct your own taste test to find your own favorite, but I suggest you take my suggestion to try Stride Forever Fruit.

review/summary: Good Fruity Gum
review/text: This is a good gum to chew if you are looking to switch from sugared to sugarless gum. It's sweet, and doesn't have a strong aspartame taste, for being sugar-free. It doesn't last 'forever' like the commercials and 'Forever Fruit' name would lead you to believe, but the flavor lasts longer than a lot of sugarless gums, and it has a nice kick of flavor when you first bite in. Everyone in my family likes this flavor of Stride.<br /><br />Don't confuse this with the darker-but-similar-colored-packaging 'Mandarin' flavor.

review/summary: If you have a brown thumb . . .
review/text: . . . like me, you can still enjoy the delicate beauty of bonsai. Carefully preserved, these are real bonsai preserved in suspended animation. They need no feeding, pruning, watering or plant care, merely cosmetic care. For those of us who don't have the time, patience or skill to cultivate plants, these make a nice surrogate, and they make nice gifts, too. Preserved bonsai can reach into the hundreds of dollars. This one is double-trunked, reasonably priced, and very attractive.

review/summary: Bonsai Packaging
review/text: We have purchased two trees and both were gifts.  The first tree was thoroughly packaged with some type of foam insulation totally surrounding the tree. Impressive. Excellent condition!  The second tree came with no insulation but with a cord attaching the tree to the bottom of the box.  A couple of small limbs were broken off.  It is much better packaging with the foam insulation.<br /><br />The gift was "assumed" by the recipiant to be artificial (fake), which in this case was not a good thing.  The gift tree was actually preserved.  It would create a much better packaging if the tree came with a certificate stating the type - live, preserved or artificial.<br /><br />Love the trees!  They made excellent gifts.

review/summary: Nice product with minor flaws
review/text: Been looking for a nice preserved Bonsai for a friend who can kill grass and this seemed like a great solution.  Shipping took a little longer than I expected, but I guess I am spoiled with Prime.  Packaging was interesting with the bowl 'cemented' into the box with spray foam.  Definitely held the piece solidly, but I almost damaged it getting it loose.  Be prepared to literally cut it out of its packaging.  A pain, but manageable.<br /><br />The piece itself was fairly well done, definitely not as good as the one in the illustration, but still a nice piece.  I will probably do some light trimming to give it a little more character before presenting to my friend.  The bowl and stone are nicely matched and the tuft of moss is a nice touch.

review/text: This makes for a great centerpiece on a dining room/coffee table as well as a great conversation piece!  I have to convince friends that this isn't a real live Bonsai tree when they see it.  It's very convincing, which is to be expected considering that this is just a real tree that's been preserved.<br /><br />My tree doesn't have the look of the picture, and the branches are much more bushy/wild, but it still looks fantastic.  I could always trim it if I wanted to make it more sparse but I like it how it is.  The moss is a nice touch, and the pebbles look great and are glued in so they won't fall out.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase!

review/summary: Fondarific Fondant
review/text: I bought this fondant to use with young teen girls who had no experience with fondant.  We used gel colors to make several different colors, and the gel colors worked beautifully with this fondant.  We didn't need the expensive cake decorator colors to get gorgeous results.  The other thing I liked was this fondant was not hard to work with.  If you can work with playdoh, then you can work with this fondant.  AND it tasted good, too!  I have tasted other fondants and it looks pretty, but you peel it off before you eat your cake.  With this fondant you will actually want to eat it as well as look at it.  This is a good choice for cooks who like their creations to look and taste good.

review/summary: Not as good as I initially thought
review/text: Love this stuff, very easy to work with and reasonably priced if you can manage to buy it through Amazon with thier subscribe and save program, otherwise it is pretty expensive and you are better off making your own MMF. The Wilton stuff is like rubber and hard to roll out thin enough. I had no trouble with this. It also was not too sticky which was the problem I ran into when I used the Duff product from Michaels. So far this is the best fondant I have used. It really doesn't dry out so if you want your pieces to stiffen up quickly or become completely hard you will need to mix in gumtex, tylose or gumpaste to accomplish that. I love the taste of this fondant too, I don't usually like fondant icings but this one is really good! The white is truely white too, not cream or antique at all so you can easily mix in other colors to tint the color you want.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/6/12<br />Lowering my stars from 5 to 3...<br />My first few batches of Fondarific were great, easy to work with, good taste, nice consistency etc. I use alot of fondant and have pretty much used every brand out there plus made my own. I was totally sold on Fondarific until my last couple of orders. I didn't feel like dying fondant so I purchased the colored Fondarific for the first time(Pink and Red) so I'm not sure if that was the problem but they were REALLY soft. Like another reviewer I ended spending an extra 3 hours or so to cover my cake and decorate it because I had to keep putting the stuff in the freezer and it tore and bubbled all over the place. It was ridiculous like working with melting taffy. I live in Washington state and it was October so humidity was definitely not the problem. My last batch of white was workable but also stickier than usual so pieces kept sticking to the mat (even with cornstarch or shortening). So far both batches of black that I purchased were great and didn't have these issues. I have to agree with other reviewers here that the consistancy is lacking with this product. If you get a good batch it is the BEST stuff out there but you have to cross your fingers and hope luck is with you. I may give them one more shot since my first few orders of white were perfect but I will probably also make some marshmellow fondant just in case they aren't up to snuff.

review/summary: Tastes great but that's about it.
review/text: This fondant tastes good but does not work well for decorating cupcakes. It's very soft and the more you mix in color, the softer it becomes. I added powdered sugar to help make it not stick to my mat, cookie cutters and tools, but it was a constant battle. My major complaint with this fondant is that it doesn't harden. I made decorations 3 days in advance (which I've done in the past using Wilton fondant) and they weren't drying. The morning I needed them, they were so soft that even picking them up distorted the shape. I ended up having to place a high powered fan in front of them while I went to work for 8 hours, only to come home to semi-dry decorations. Because I have a ton left over, I'm going to try and mix gum paste with it to see if that helps with the stickiness and drying time. I do not recommend this product if you're trying to create flowers, stars or any type of decoration that requires tools and drying time. Needless to say, I will not be buying this product again.

It takes color very nicely, I use Wilton's gel colors, and is very easy to work with. It's a little hard when you take it out of the container, but I just pop it in the microwave for 10seconds and it becomes soft enough for me to work with.<br />This fondant tastes soooo good! Like cotton candy. Delicious!!<br />I made a 3 tier birthday cake using this stuff and I still have some fondant left over.<br />My tiers were 10", 8" and 6". The first two tiers were 4" tall and the 6" tier was 8" tall. I also used this for decorations.<br />Everyone at the party loved it!

review/summary: I really wanted to like this fondant!
review/text: I did a lot of research on this fondant and really wanted to like it however it just didn't work for me. When it arrived it was hard as a rock, but there is a card inside that indicates about 30-50 seconds in the microwave will make it easier to work with. This really did work well. It made it much more pliable and easier to work with. The fondant took color real well and rolled out nicely. It does say "no shortening or powdered sugar needed" that's pretty false. If you're coloring it you do need some while needing otherwise it will stick to your hands and your work surface. I DEFINITELY needed powdered sugar while rolling it out. Otherwise it stuck to the silicon mat I use. Also, after coloring and putting it in the microwave it definitely needed some time in the refrigerator before it could be rolled again and placed on the cake. Otherwise it was far too gooey.<br /><br />Finally, the moment of truth arrived, laying the rolled out fondant on the cake. It was much more difficult to work with than I imagined. It's very picky on the thickness. Too thick it's impossible to lay flat, too thin and it would stretch and get holes. I will say it did get some 'elephant skin' during application I was able to smooth it out using a smoothing tool and the final product looked fine. Perhaps I was a little bit rusty, I used to teach a Wilton cake decorating class and have taught fondant decorating for many years but haven't done a cake in the past 5-6 years. I just never remember the wilton brand, which tastes horrible, ever being this hard to work with.<br /><br />The flavor was fine on it's own, but as most fondants, it's incredibly sweet..incredibly. Despite the improved flavor people were still pealing it off the cake and eating the cake and frosting.<br /><br />In the end the cake looked wonderful and people were pleased but not sure I'll be using this brand again.

review/summary: Best Fondant
review/text: I purchased this fondant for a wedding cake that I was making.  I have tried numerous brands and even made my own fondant.  This Fondarific fondant is easy to work with.  I am an amateur baker and will purchase this product again.

review/summary: Generally a good product, but quality is NOT consistent
review/text: I have ordered many tubs of fondarific in many colors, and generally don't have many problems. If you are looking for a fondant to sculpt figurines out of, this is not the fondant for you. It is, however, the best tasting fondant you will find, guaranteed. It does not dry out which is lovely for covering cakes, but is the reason sculpting is impossible.<br /><br />This last time I ordered a five pound bucket in wedding white, it was horrible. It was so soft it was almost gooey. I had my AC at 65 degrees, placed it in the freezer for awhile, and it was still stretchy and soft as if I had been kneading it forever. I even added some gumpaste and a ton of tylose to try to stiffen it a little, to no avail.<br /><br />I was in a bind and had no time to get or make more fondant, so my cake took 3 times as long as it would have, and it looked horrible. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />I guess I just got a bad batch this time. I would suggest that you order ahead of time and check it first so you don't get stuck like I did.

review/summary: Easy breezy!
review/text: I used this fondant to create dice to add to cupcakes for a Bunko for the Cure fundraiser.  They came out awesome and were a huge hit!  The fondant color was bright white and worked great with the Wilton food markers (for the dots on the dice).  This fondant is so incredibly easy to work with and it tasted delicious.  Even the non-fondant lovers in the crowd (including me) loved the taste! I look forward to using this product again....and again....and again!

review/summary: This is the first review I have ever written...
review/text: ...so you know I am serious. I would give it a 0, were it an option. I love Amazon - they have never let me down, so I am hoping they come through for me when I file a claim with them.<br /><br />The product was rock hard, so I followed the enclosed instructions and heated it even less than the recommended time in the microwave. It kneaded easily enough and smelled/ tasted good. When it came to rolling, I could tell immediately that this was going to be a challenge. Sure enough, it tore all over the place. Redo. I used cornstarch, the way I was taught, and it still stuck to every surface as if it were too warm or wet, yet cracked as if it were too dry. Nothing made it cooperate, so I lowered my standards and draped it anyway. Durring the two-foot trip from the rolling surface to the cake, it ripped in several places and the application to the cake ended in absolute disaster. No, I did not roll it too thin. Yes, I used cornstarch (even though the packaging specifically claims it is unnecessary.) It sucks. The end.

review/summary: Gummy mess
review/text: This product was so easy to work with.  On 6/23/12 I made a little over 100 flowers for wedding cupcakes, the following day I did the same using a different color of Satin Ice. The flowers of both fondants were firm, I stored them in an air tight container. On 7/2/12 I opened the container of flower made with the Fondarific and they were soft.  The flowers made from Satin Ice were perfect. I left the container of Fondarific flowers open over night to see if they would harden up again, they turned out "gummy", you know, like chewed gum, which is probably less sticky than this mess.  I am so dissappointed in this product.  Fortunately I made my flowers early, I have time to purchase Satin Ice and make 100 more flowers.  I do not recommend this product.

review/summary: Very Dissapointing
review/text: I was very dissapointed with this fondant. I decided to try it for the first time, and that was a mistake. They claim that the fondant can be rolled out thinner then most brands, so you can use less to decorate more. That is not true. Even just rolling it out to 1/8in it tends to tear. Once I finally got it on the cake to cover, it is very hard to smooth it around the cake. It is very sticky, the fondant smoother does not glide smoothly over it. All in all I will never buy this brand again, I am going to stick with Wilton.

review/summary: Old batch?
review/text: Fondarific usually has glowing reviews... everyone on the cake forums seems to love it.  My batch was either old or just crap.  Very disappointing.  Will go back to making marshmallow fondant.... cheaper and WAY easier to work with.  Also bought the black but didn't open it because the white was such crap.  Had to use it because I ran out of time to make MMF for the cake I was making... DUE TO THE FACT THAT I PRE-PURCHASED fondant to use.<br /><br />I love working with Fondant, and thought that maybe I'd use something easier this time, but it wasn't.  Good luck with this.<br /><br />Taste however, was quite good.

review/summary: Checked off my bucket list
review/text: When I first heard of Kopi Luwak coffee I was horrified, but then the idea grew on me and I decided I really wanted to try it, so on my bucket list it went.  To purchase this same package directly from the producer is nearly twice the price.  There's not really 16 servings per package, maybe half that.  It is pretty amazing coffee and I'm thrilled I tried it.  Remember when shopping for Kopi Luak coffe make sure you're getting 100% civit coffee and not a blend which can have as little at 1 or 2% Kopi Luwak coffee.  Check out realkopiluwak.com for info on how civit coffee is produced and how to brew the perfect cup.

review/summary: Another item off the "bucket list"
review/text: After doing a TON of research and reading about Civet coffee- I finally broke down and purchased this for my birthday, just to give it a shot. At first, I was not impressed- thinking that I just overpaid for some upgraded Folgers- but then I figured it out. The secret to this coffee is making it in smaller batches- At first I was making 4-5 cups at a time in my small coffee pot- then I cut that back to a two cup using approx. 3 tablespoons of freshly ground coffee- It was AMAZING!!! The depth and natural sweetness of this coffee were unbelievable. Definitely something worth trying at least once- I for one will be looking forward to the next time I can justify purchasing this special occasion coffee...

review/text: I thought that I should post a review in response to bad cat.  We ordered off the same batch for the same holiday reasons and had no illl effects.  The coffee was great.  There was no tart aftertaste no matter how strong you brew it.  The only reason that I gave it only four stars is that I would personally of liked a litter darker roast.  I just wanted to say that we drank off the same lot as bad cat, in the same year, Christmas Eve and Christmas, with zero headaches or ill tidings.  It just might have been something else.

review/summary: Good beans, OK price
review/text: If you want 100% Kopi Luwak, this is a good method to acquire some in a relatively cheap manner. It's not as good as some of the stuff I've had, but it's definitely in that special class that Kopi Luwak belongs in. I've served this for guest, given it as gifts, and enjoyed it on special occasions. I've made it in French press, drip, and in one special instance Espresso!<br /><br />To truly enjoy it, use about 8 grams of beans per 7 ounces of hot water used to brew. This is the appropriate ratios. Serve black, no cream or sugar as this will ruin your treat. This bean isn't for everyone, but don't worry! It's not an acquired taste, its just a different taste :-)<br /><br />Product arrived fast thank to prime, fresh as I wanted, and the beans tasted just like they do when I buy them locally from Rao's Bakery here in TX (same beans same company).

I wanted this product to make their rub. When it arrived..quickly I may add..you could smell the powerful scent through the package. It was wonderful..strong aroma,color and flavor..This is the perfect product in a perfect size. I once found a small bottle in a specialty store and paid almost 8 dollars for 4oz...I'm not sure how many ounces is in this 6 inch bottle, but it is way more than 4oz.. I also got a great deal on the shipping..I paid 7.95 for the first item and the rest was shipped free...can't beat that! I love this product!!!

Hence: Barbecue.

Anyway, again there was no effect with lemons, chili sauce, etc. Our daughter also had no discernible change in her taste of foods.<br /><br />Happily for me, the company is going to refund me for the other three packages.

review/text: Not much to say, other than the product solicitation is all hype! I carefully followed the directions on the packaging of the "mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets" and the results were about as miraculous as one of those potato chips baring the face of Mary Magdelene! Sorry "Believers of Miracles"... this is one that won't make "The Tonight Show"!

review/summary: Notification of Cancelled order 2 weeks after order was placed
review/text: I was excited about these and had organized a whole event for my fiancee's birthday around these tablets.<br />Placed an order well in advance, namely 3 weeks in advance.<br /><br />After two weeks of waiting, I received a notification that my order was being cancelled for some mysterious as yet to be determined problem. The email attempted to spread the blame between Amazon, its supplier and some mysterious unknown factor, ultimately taking no real responsibility for the blunder.<br /><br />Color me frustrated and confused because while they said they are stopping all orders for the time being, their company website still shows the product in stock and ready for orders.<br /><br />This to say the least was very disappointing and more so because the company's response was very wishy washy and lame. In my experience, when a company screws up (mind you it wasn't just my order, it was a whole slew of orders that got cancelled)<br />they should own up and take responsibility thereby showing some integrity, rather than mutter some indecipherable mumbo jumbo that does nothing to explain nor solve the customers problem.

review/text: I'm jealous of whoever thought of this, but the actual product turns out to be pretty unimpressive. It turns out, if you eat half a fruit roll-up, then eat asparagus, the aspragus tastes differently than you might expect.  There. That's all you need to know.  DON'T buy this product, just buy some Gushers next time you're at Wal-Mart.  2 star review because I like Gushers.

review/summary: Did next to nothing like it says it will.....
review/text: I dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing.  I added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter, but it didnt make them taste good.....It makes really sour things slightly sweeter....but NO MIRACLE.

review/summary: Ehhhhhh
review/text: Well I bought these to have a "Food Tripping Party" with my wife. I had a spread before us of lemons, limes, strawberries, blackberries, oranges, and grapefruit. We both started with half a pill each as per the reviews here. I then took a bite of a lemon. I guess is was sweeter but not by much, though I was able to eat it. It was like a sweet + tart food which I guess is because of the acid in the fruit. I then ate another half of pill because the instructions that came with the pills stated to take a full one. I tried again. It made the lemons bearable but not super sweet. You would not be able to eat an entire be happy. I went onto the other fruits and the same thing. You could still taste the tart with a sweet aftertaste. My wife said this, "Well it makes it so you can eat lemons, but who wants to sit around eating lemons all day?" I'm disappointed BUT the price was cheap enough and it was a fun thing to do with my wife. I'll pawn these off on friends and see what they say. To all the people who threw parties and raved and raved about how everyone loved them, my guess is that they didn't want you to feel bad.

review/text: It didn't work for me.  Maybe its because I couldn't get past letting the whole tablet dissolve because to me the tablet tasted like vomit.

review/summary: Yep, it works!
review/text: This product definitely works.<br />I was not aware that i was supposed to break the tablet in half. After eating a whole tablet, I ate a lemon. It was WAY WAY too sweet!<br />I waited 2 hours for the product to wear off so i could eat regular food.<br />I tried a 1/2 tablet the next day. I added some lemon to a glass of water. To me, it tasted like lemonade with 5 packets of splenda. It didn't taste like regular sugar. Which i guess is good. The sweet taste was just different.<br />I also ate cottage cheese, it tasted like cottage cheese with sweetener in it.<br />The product works immediately by the way. No waiting for this to work.<br /><br />I think this product will last me a while.<br />The day after this review I took a tiny nibble of the leftover 1/2 tablet.I made another glass of lemon water and the lemonade was perfect for me. Not overly sweet, tasted like a lemon drop ;p<br />Your mileage may vary with this product.<br /><br />I've heard that other brands taste a bit better than this one.<br />I just ordered a pack from another company. I will report back.<br /><br />I have a HUGE sweet tooth and I'm trying to lose some weight. I'm hoping these tablets will help me with that :)
