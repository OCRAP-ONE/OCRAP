review/summary: Flat Out Yum
review/text: There pretty much aren't any bad things to say about this tea.  I love it and drink it every morning, black with no milk or sugar.  It was a very "round", robust flavor that is invigorating and deep.<br /><br />I've found the best way to brew it is to pour the water in with the bag, let it sit for 3-5 minutes, take out the bag and let it cool for around another five minutes if you have the time.  That extra cooling time is pretty important for all Mighty Leaf teas or you miss a lof of flavor otherwise.<br /><br />It'd be nice if it was cheaper, since it costs more than anything else I've had, but it's one of those splurges I allow myself in life.  Give it a try.  If you like breakfast teas, you won't be sorry.

review/text: This is, as all Ahmad teas are, a strong, flavorful tea.  The vanilla flavor isn't overwhelming, as one reviewer asserted.  If you don't like the taste of vanilla though, you probably shouldn't buy something called "Vanilla Tea".  So, to those of you looking for a high-end, wonderfully flavored vanilla tea, this should fit the bill.  Lastly, I have steeped 3 unflavored, "black" teabags with one vanilla teabag when I wanted a more subtle flavor. A seasoned tea drinker should experiment.  Enjoy.

review/text: I'm a tea lover and as much as I like super fancy blends, sometimes plain black tea is the most  soothing and simply satisfying.  This tea is a simple and delicious treat with some smooth creamy vanilla and if anything its even more comforting and luxurious than any of my favorite black teas. The taste is so natural and subtly sweet that it feels extra special and can really be drank at any time of the day instead of plain tea.<br /><br />Im really looking forwards to trying all of the flavors Ahmad carries, and at these great prices I see no obstacles on my tea tasting journey!<br /><br />Each bag is packaged beautifully in foil and the box can stand straight up, facing forward with this removable slit at the bottom for easy dispensing.<br /><br />Lovely and tasty, simply great tea.

review/summary: Ahmad Vanilla Black Tea
review/text: Ahmad vanilla black tea has a smooth taste.  I found that I missed it when I went back to regular tea blends.  I didn't think I would like the vanilla flavor since I tend not to like the cinnamon teas, fruity teas, etc.  Perhaps the vanilla makes the tea less bitter.  I drink it black.  Being in tea bags rather than loose tea makes it easier to have at work.  This is one of those "try it, you'll like it" things.

review/text: If you want a plain Vanilla Black tea this is it!  Something so simple is so hard to find.  There are many teas that state they are Vanilla teas but once you purchase the teas you discover it will have a "hint" of some other flavor which totally throws it all off.  The aroma of the Ahmed Vanilla Black tea is Orgasmic!  The taste is wonderful.  No hint of peppermint, or anything else like other teas, just Vanilla and black.  Exactly how I want it.

review/text: This tea is making it's rounds with my group of friends. I tried it at a baby shower and soon the mom-to-be and I had were drinking it. It's got a great flavor. Often flavored teas have an odd taste. Fake, maybe waxy, definitely not natural. Not Ahmad Tea. It smells great, tastes great. It tastes like black tea with a hint of vanilla. To me, vanilla is not a strong flavor, more of a strong smell so I love that I smell the vanilla strongly but taste it subtly. I'm typically a loose-leaf tea drinker, and tea is my caffeinated beverage of choice, so a bagged tea has to be pretty special for me to buy it. I think this tea is. I look forward to trying some more Ahmad Tea flavors.

review/text: Personally, I love this tea, but I am more addicted to black tea than most humans.<br />This is a very decent Indian Tea. It may not be the best you ever tasted, but it is quite good as an everyday tea. It reminds me a bit of Lipton Gold loose tea (which I used to get from an Indian foods shop). It is not particularly complex (a slight maltiness, with orange overtones, but not much more beyond "tasting like tea").<br />It is a very full-bodied orange-pekoe type tea, with a slight astringency ("briskness"). Be careful not to steep it for too long. As long as that precaution is taken, this will satisfy the cravings for black tea oomph, if enough leaves are used.

review/text: I have a fairly finnicky cat with special needs.  He's been on a "high-end" cat food all his life (8 yrs.) - including switching him to the company's special diet for cats with urinary issues after his DVM suggested that following a problem last year.  I started reading more and more about proper nutrition for cats and realized I was not feeding my little guy what he needed.  I switched to Merrick and my finnicky eater has become a glutton.  He loves it!!  No hairball prizes!  His coat feels like satin, and he has the energy of a year-old kitten!<br /><br />When I showed the contents of the can to my husband (retired DVM), he was impressed by the ingredients list, which is meats and veggies - not fillers!  Surprisingly, Merrick's is less expensive than the food I've been using! Win-win!

review/text: This is a wonderful Kenyan coffee!  But to get the full benefit you need to be forewarned that to enjoy this coffee to the fullest you will have to use more ground beans per pot than you are used to with other beans.  The reason, is that these beans are very delicate and light - they don't have the oil content of say Columbian or Guatemalan beans - so you most likely will have to increase the amount of grind per pot of coffee by about a third or you will miss the full flavor and delicate balance of this wonderful gourmet roast.<br /><br />Once you get the measurements right - this coffee will most-likely become your favorite.  It sure became my favorite - to the exclusion of all others!

review/summary: Reviewers are joking, right?
review/text: I hope you guys are joking with these 5 star reviews.  I bought this based on the reviews and it was the stalest, most bitter whole bean coffee I've ever used.  One of the canisters was open on arrival but there was literally no difference between the aromas of the sealed cans and the open can.  What does that say about the freshness of the sealed cans?  You can seal it tight as a drum but if the coffee sat around and got stale before it was canned then all the vacuum in the world won't help it.  Then I couldn't get that stale aroma/flavor out of my grinder without thoroughly cleaning it.  I don't know what you guys are used to drinking but this isn't worth 1/4 of the price regardless of how much it costs.  If you think this is 5 stars then check out RONA, which Amazon carries.  Their Jamaican Blue Mountain Peaberry is without peer.  Compare their Kenya AA Superior Peaberry to this swill and you will know what premium coffee is supposed to taste like.  This is a perfect example of gettting what you pay for.

review/text: I normally chew peppermint gum, but Stride 2.0 Spearmint gum is a pleasure.  It has a bold but not overpowering flavor.  That flavor also lasts quite a while.  I do wish the pieces were a little bigger though, I often chew two at once because they are a bit small.<br /><br />One thing I didn't expect when I tried to pull the first piece out of the box is that it was stuck.  Stuck!?  I had to give it a pretty good little tug to get it out.  I soon realized that each piece was glued to the box - not really all that tough to get out, but stuck there none-the-less.  So I started thinking a little too much about why sticks of gum would be glued in place requiring the customer to really have to pull to get it it out, and it hit me!  What if I drop the box?  If the pieces of gum weren't attached to the box they would scatter all over the place.  The same goes if the box were to open in a pocket, bag, or purse.  This little bit of foresight and thinking really earned my admiration!<br /><br />Nice!<br /><br />5 stars (5+ if the pieces were just a little bigger!

review/text: I was looking for an easy, high fiber meal for my husband and I when I found this soup mix.  It takes just 12 minutes to cook (once the water boils) and is so amazing tasty!  I add a handful of ham chunks at the end and a tablespoon of olive oil - it makes two large, dinner-size bowls of soup for us.  Smells amazing - we eat every bite!

review/text: I first bought these for backpacking on Cascade and Olympic mountain trails, but found I use them as often in the home!  This is a rich, flavorful soup that's as easy to make as boiling water. I tend to buy them in bulk because I give as many to friends as I use for myself.  I've used other Alessi products with equal satisfaction.

review/summary: The real French Maille mustard
review/text: The Maille mustard available in the USA is produced in Canada and not the same recipe as the original French type.  I recently visited the Maille Boutique at place de la Madeleine in Paris to find out why their French products are now not avilable in the USA.  I was told that several years ago the US Government imposed a 200 percent import tax on any mustard produced in France.  I assume some lobby of US mustard producers induced Congress to impose this duty.<br />So the Maille name was formed as a Canadian company, not associated with Maille of France, so that the mustard can be imported into the USA from Canada without this import duty since it was now being produced in Canada without the original Maille famous recipes. The taste of the Canadian produced Maille is not as good as the Maille mustards from France.  So thank you to Congress for your interference in commerce from the great mustards from France.  I did bring some various Maille mustards back with me from France but packed up in my checked luggage as customs will not allow you to bring them in carry on luggage.

review/summary: WARNING, WARNING, WARNING ! NO LONGER MILD !
review/text: I have been a huge fan of Maille Dijon Mustard for years -- it was the ONLY brand I'd buy, even though it was not cheap.  Well, I replaced my last bottle with another, which appeared to be the same label, size, product, and said "Maille Dijon Originale" on the label.  What I didn't notice was the word "Hot", in small letters, sideways, on the right hand edge of the label.  It blew my sinuses out!!!<br /><br />I am not a fan of hot mustard, and this product was inedible to me.  I mostly use the mustard mixed 50/50 with good apricot jam (no HFCS) as a marinade for pork tenderloin, with part being reduced to half for a nice sauce for the meat.  This product is now useless to make that recipe.<br /><br />I have searched EVERY local market, and every one of them carries Maille, and every jar says "Hot" on the edge of the label.  If you are looking for a mild Dijon mustard for a specific recipe, this product is to be avoided!  Such a shame, such a shame . . .

review/text: Maile from France is simply the best Dijon mustard available in the U.S.<br /><br />Yes, it is expensive, and too expensive on Amazon.  See if it's available at a Cost Plus or World Market.  It's sold at these markets in S. California for about $4.99 for a 13.4-ounce jar.  It's available but more expensive at supermarkets.<br /><br />But, it's worth the World Market price because it's excellent, and smaller amounts than other brands will suffice.

Not only is it 80% organic but the refreshing subtle taste of lemon grass with powerful antioxidant ingredient like grapeseed extract (protect cells from free radical damage and also promotes healthy circulation) should make one incorporate tea drinking in one's daily life. Other health benefits of green tea are for symptoms like headaches, body aches and pains, digestion, depression, immune enhancement, detoxification, as an energizer, and to prolong life. The only side effect is insomnia and I'm suffering from it but I know my immune system is thanking me for 6 cups of green tea each day!

Not sure if it's actually anti-aging...that's a pretty bold claim...but it's nice! Mildly caffeinated so it gives me some energy without making me wired. And it's good plain or with milk or even milk and sugar, if you want to make it more like a dessert.

review/summary: Perfect Everyday Green Tea
review/text: *****<br />What a wonderful tea this is! Herb-y tasting in a good way, and slightly sweet (from the licorice root) with lemongrass overtones and jasmine reminisces. This Green Tea Super Anti-Oxidant from Yogi Tea is one of my favorite teas. It has everything to make it a perfect everyday green tea. It is made from Organic Lemongrass, Organic Green Tea Leaf, Organic Licorice Root, Jasmine Green Tea Leaf, Organic Alfalfa Leaf, Organic Burdock Root, Organic Dandelion Root, Grapeseed Extract, Irish Moss Powder, and Emblic Fruit (Amla) Extract.<br /><br />Green Tea Super Anti-Oxidant comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />According to Yogi Tea, this tea is 80% organic and is intended combat the damage of free radicals in the body that accelerate aging. It contains 21mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee).<br /><br />Yogi Green Tea Super Anti-Oxidant makes me glad every day that I stopped drinking coffee and switched to teas---it's that good! If you've only tried commercial brands like Stash and Celestial Seasoning, and you think you don't like tea because they taste fake and full of strong flavorings, then you owe it to yourself to give this tea a try. If you enjoy Stash and Celestial Seasonings, love their strong flavors, and disagree with me, you may not like this tea as it is subtle and a very different tea-drinking experience. You'll know what type of tea drinker you are!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Very good but not the best Yogi green tea flavor
review/text: I have really been into Yogi tea and trying them all! I have all the green teas and after a month of testing them I conclude that Rejuvenation tastes the best. It has a natural peach and lemon flavor that is very natural and mild. Most say the Simply Green tastes the best but to me it was far too boring. I got used to all the special herbs and natural flavors and the Simply Green had none added. I do not like the artificial flavors at all, nor do I like the artificial sweet taste added by too much stevia leaf.<br /><br />The Super Anti-Oxidant variety of tea tastes good except for the licorice. The licorice is okay in the bedtime and calming teas, but does not taste right in green tea. Other then the licorice it does have a very good lemon flavor that is soothing and mild. The Kombucha tea is also great which has a berry taste, that is good and natural passion fruit and plum, but I prefer the lemon flavor in my green tea. The Slim Life tea is also very good but it does have a blueberry flavor in it, but it is worlds better then the Fasting tea, which tastes the worst of all the Yogi teas. I just love the Yogi tea positive messages don't you? At first I just bought these teas for the messages then I learned to love the tea as well! Rejuvenation is my favorite green tea and Peach Detox and Redbush Chai are my favorite flavored teas and make exceptionally good iced tea as well! The flavors, however, are very close and it took me quite a while to figure out which green tea I prefered the best. This one is good if you like licorice in your green tea that is.<br /><br />Wise quotes from Yogi Tea by Yogi Bhajan<br /><br />"The universe is the stage on which you dance, guided by your heart."<br /><br />"The purpose of life is to enjoy every moment."<br /><br />"Delight the world with compassion, kindness and grace."<br /><br />"Laugh because that is your purpose in life."<br /><br />Happiness is every human beings birthright."<br /><br />"Be happy so long as breath is in you."<br /><br />"Real happiness lies in that which never comes nor goes, but simply is."<br /><br />"Travel light, live light, spread the light, be the light."<br /><br />"Your greatness is not what you have, it's what you give."<br /><br />"Practice kindness, mercy and forgiveness."<br /><br />"Bliss cannot be disturbed by gain or loss."<br /><br />"Compassion has no limit.

review/text: So, I've Never been a tea drinker until one day I was getting sick and decided to buy some Oregeno herbs from the market. As I walked past the tea aisle I figured they must have some tea that's immune system boosting or something. Well, I found a yogi tea that did just that. But that's not the point. The point is that after proceeding to buy 8 different Yogi Tea flavors I decided to try this super antioxidant green tea.<br /><br />I bought one 16 packet box of the stuff , and 3 days later, a few hundred searches later (on the health benefits of green tea) I ordered this 6 pack from Amazon.<br /><br />I am a college student who didn't used to like waking up early and sitting through 2 hour Computer Science lectures, but this s*** gets me through the day. And with hot-water available through-ought the day in any of several cafes you will never see me without a cup of tea.<br /><br />This super-antioxidant green tea is definitely on my list of top 3 favorites, along with yogi tea detox and immune support. I encourage everyone to google "green tea health benefits" and decide for yourself if you want to give it a try, if not with yogi, then perhaps some other (maybe loose leaf) brand.<br /><br />-take care, stay healthy.

The sweetness is no where near as powerful as the Egyptian licorice tea, but it is still there.  This sweetness is very similar to a very mild artificial sweetness seen in sugar free drinks.  If you are looking for a slightly sweet aftertaste, then this tea is certainly for you!

review/text: I'll admit it:  I am a heavy drinker.  Of tea.  Lots and lots of tea.

Beyond the powerful antioxidant action, tea leaves contain a powerful amino acid called L-theanine, good for the soul--Google it to learn more.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy the taste of this tea (I sweeten mine with a packet of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E3OE">SweetLeaf All Natural Zero Calories SteviaPlus, 100 Packets, 3.5 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> ) & highly recommend it--it has a wonderful, full flavor and no bitterness (tip:  don't bring your water to the boiling point & don't steep for more than 3 to 3-1/2 minutes.  If you get your water too hot, you'll ruin the taste of ANY green tea!).

review/text: this is a nice smooth green tea. actually, I have tried many flavors of Yogi tea, and they are all lovely. bedtime tea really does put me gently off to sleep. egyptian licorice has a nice little bite to it, and the women's formulas help with hormonal issues. I have not found a bad flavor. : )

review/summary: It grew on me!
review/text: The first time I drank this tea, I hated it.  I left it in my tea cabinet and never touched it again.  I drink about 10 cups of green tea a day, and recently, I went to a salon where they were serving free green tea.  I had to take some.  The tea was incredible, and it turns out that it was the exact same tea that I had shunned the first time I tried it.<br /><br />Yes, it has a distinct aftertaste.  It doesn't taste like green tea, in my opinion.  After you swallow it, an incredible taste bursts out and coats your entire throat.  It's truly delicious.  I don't know what herb is contributing to the aftertaste, but I can tell you that I've been drinking this all day and I wish there was an identical loose leaf version.<br /><br />With other teas, I start to feel sick if I drink too much.  This is the only flavor of Yogi tea I've ever tried, and I'm thrilled that I can drink cup after cup without feeling sick.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />If you don't like it the first time around, give it another shot.  Don't brew the tea at too hot of a temperature -- if the water is boiling, it's too hot.  I brew it at drinking temperature and I dip the bag a few times in the water.  Mmmmmm.

review/text: Love this tea.  It's my coffee alternative.  Tastes great hot or cold.  Packed with antioxidants.  I'll make a thermos full of it in the winter and drink it all morning.  In the summer, I'll make a half thermos full with 5 or more tea bags, let it sit for 20 minutes, then poor over ice and store in fridge for a great ice tea.

review/text: I come from India and i have a taste for different Teas. Yogi Green Tea Antioxidants is the smoothest of them all. You might cringe at first because of an after taste(due to the amla-gooseberry extract) but after that you'll cherish the flavor. We got a pack of 6 from Amazon and we are already into the 3rd box in less than 2 weeks.

review/summary: Green Tea Super Antioxidant
review/text: This review is for the Green Tea Super Antioxidant. I can see many of the flavors are being reviewed under one product here.<br /><br />I enjoy tea but have always had a hard time making it part of a healthy routine. This tea has made me enjoy it so much that I now have my daily tea without fail.<br /><br />It has flowery notes like that from an Orange blossom for me this flavor is addicting along with the lemongrass. I just love how<br />the other herbs they add to the blend make it so much more flavorful than you average green tea. This method of blending<br />has been proven by science to be the most effective against both treating and preventing cancer as well. If you look up Cancer under TEDtalks website or youtube channel you can find video lectures on this subject. In short blending tea varieties as well as herbal blends have more of a health effect than a single tea variety or single plant variety.<br /><br />I have since branched into a few other flavors of Yogi teas... This one is my go to favorite but I enjoy the others too especially for variety.<br /><br />My mother is now loving this green tea as well I got her a 1 year supply of the green tea and Vanilla spice for Mothers Day. She loves<br />them both.

review/summary: not a fan of licorice, yogi tea has an amazon no return policy
review/text: I'm not a fan of licorice and it turns out this tea has it.  After trying one, the ingredient was undeniably there.  May not be a lot, but enough that I can actually taste it.  Should have checked the actual ingredients section because it's on there.  The product summary or product description didn't have it included however.  Moral of the story is: check the ingredients section before you buy any of these Yogi special green tea blend teas. If you don't like it, you're going to get stuck with a whole lot of boxes that you can't return.  Here is the message I found on the page where you would normally do amazon.com returns:<br /><br />"This item is not eligible for return. Please see our Returns Policy for more information. If you require further assistance, please use the Contact Us button on the Help pages. "<br /><br />It's not that bad of a tea though, and that's why I'm giving it 4 stars (even though it's more like a 3.5).

review/summary: Everyone Has Different Tastes
review/text: After reading some of the recent bad reviews, I had to throw my opinion in here.  And no, I'm not an employee of Yogi as one reviewer suggested, just a normal everyday tea drinker (4-7 cups per day).<br /><br />Yogi Super Antioxidant has become my first cup of tea every morning, and I love the taste, it is very well-balanced.  If someone is used to drinking milder regular store brands like Lipton, Bigelow, Tazo, Twinings, etc, I can't imagine there are too many teas made by Yogi, Stash, Organic India, Guayaki...that you would like.  Everyone has different tastes, and not all teas will be appealing to everyone. Most of my family can't stand Yogi Teas, but drink Lipton every day.<br /><br />It is possible some people got a bad box of tea, this has happened to me before.  And trust me, you know when you get a bad box, you think someone put powdered alum in your tea bag!

review/summary: A great pick-me-up and helps me feel rejuvenated!
review/text: I love the Yogi brand range of tea and this is one of my favorites. This green tea has a strong lemongrass scent and flavor which makes it really refreshing and a great pick-me-up. I drink a cup daily and it makes me feel rejuvenated and energized. The tea contains grapeseed and amla extract which are natural antioxidants, so drinking this also has detoxifying benefits. The herbs contained in this tea are mostly organic, i.e. organic lemongrass, organic green tea leaf, organic licorice root, jasmine green tea leaf, organic alfalfa leaf, organic burdock root, organic dandelion root, and irish moss powder. There is a small amount of caffeine in this tea, about 21 mg which is still way less than the amount of caffeine found in regular coffee. I love it!

review/text: I am new to the whole green tea craze. I started drinking it about 2 months ago when I started a "skin" focused diet. I bought this tea since it has extra antioxidants in it but to be honest the taste is a bit odd to me. I believe the lemongrass overpowers the taste of the tea. Just an FYI in case you are not too keen on the taste of lemongrass. I prefer Numi green tea w. toasted rice simply because I think the true green tea taste shines through more. I also noticed that this tea does give me more of a caffeine kick than the numi tea. Not a bad tea just not what I expected.

review/text: I wanted to eliminate coffee from my day because I was getting an upset stomach.  I had ordered some free samples directly from Yogi tea and was amazed at how good the tea tasted with very little sweetener.<br />I signed up for auto shipment and am so glad that I did.  This tea tastes incredibly good hot, not so hot, cooler.  I add a bit of honey (since I am a sweet lover) but my husband doesn't even add that.  It also smells incredibly good.<br />This change is the only recent change that I have made to my day and I can feel the benefits already.  I feel peppier and just over-all better.<br />I plan on drinking this tea forever.  I love it.  It is by far the best tasting tea that I have ever had and would highly recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: Yogi Tea is for Me!
review/text: This product was my first foray into green tea.  I like Yogi Tea because the "green" in it is moderate, and does not cause me to think I'm drinking grass or moss!  Yogi green tea is not decaffeinated, so drinking large quantities of it can give you the shakes, as I discovered after my 4th hot cup and 5th large glass over ice one day!! I was looking for a substitute for plain water.  I cannot tell whether the super anti-oxidant formulation does anything for me, but I will take the experts' word for it and continue to drink it... in moderation!

review/summary: Not your typical green tea - from an avid green tea drinker
review/text: I was looking through Amazon's selection of green teas and came upon this treasure. When I first tasted it, I was somewhat upset that it did not really taste like green tea. The taste of lemon grass and herbs seemed to overpower any hint of green tea, which was pretty upsetting... at first. I proceeded to finish the cup while continuing to read whatever I was reading, and then it hit me. After I finished my first cup, I found myself wanting more. Yes, after several sips, yes I was able to start tasting the green tea, but more than that, I was left with this new found sensation in my mouth that I just could not explain. The best way I could explain it was, and this may sound silly, but it was as if little fairies were dancing around in my throat. You have to try it to know what I'm talking about. Are all Yogi teas like this? The tea is wonderfully soothing and energizing at the same time. Try it out! You will get used to the taste and begin to actually fall in love with it. Plus, this tea is full of free radical fighting antioxidants.<br /><br />It's good and good for you!

Unfortunately, they all taste exactly the same -- like licorice. If you like licorice flavor, you'll like this tea. If you're looking for something that actually tastes like lemon and ginger, look elsewhere.

review/text: I am a daily herbal tea drinker. I prefer green teas, but also love red bush teas. I used to drink fruit teas and even longer ago, I drank black teas before going caffine-free. I never thought I would not like a tea. Well, this is the first one that makes me cringe and I wish to never drink it again. Unfortunately, I bought 6 boxes here at amazon with many individually wrapped bags, and I don't want to throw my money away, so I will drink all 6 boxes (I did leave one at a family member's house, just to be rid of a whole box). I bought one box of the Yogi Blueberry Slim tea at the store (one box only to test it first) and it's quite good. As the title of my review states, this tea tastes like perfumed soap, so I can't recommend this super anti-oxidant flavor. I do love the little tags attached to the bags carrying wise sayings :)

Stay away, it tastes as if you are licking the bottom of a tree stump in a mossy overgrown forest and then swallowing a mouthful of bark.  These 5 and 4 star ratings are very suspect and I believe they are generated by employees of Yogi corporation.

review/summary: Yogi Rejuvenation tea is better
review/text: I've tried many of the Yogi teas, and I really don't like the taste of this one.  I recommend the Rejuvination tea - it is a green tea that also fights free radicals and aging, but it has a much smoother taste.

review/summary: Tea that isn't tea and that's really hard to drink
review/text: I bought Yogi tea after reading all the good reviews it got on Amazon. Boy, was I disappointed!<br />It's very very hard to drink. I forced it down my throat and it took a lot from me<br />to hold it down. I had the puke sensation for a long time after drinking it. Now I know,<br />why it works for weightloss. After drinking this, you don't feel like eating or drinking anything. I also noticed that this tea has all kinds of (organic) ingredients, only<br />that it is missing is Tea! Go figure!<br /><br />So far I've used 3 tea bags, the rest is going to my trash bin. What a waste of money.

review/summary: YUMMY TEA
review/text: This is a great tea on its own, but I discovered it's even better when you brew it along with a tea bag of black tea together.....

review/summary: Great topper for all sorts of goodies
review/text: This item is harder to find in local stores, although one store does carry it that is not as close to me as I would like and it runs a bit more $$$.<br /><br />This is better heated. Cold, it smells of cocoa powder. Heated, it is yummy. Just heat on a lower power for longer, to be glass-safe, eh? I find that what they recommend never even begins to melt any fudge/chocolate topping jar. Heating on a power of 2 or 3 for about the same amount of minutes does the trick for my micro. Disclaimer: micros vary blah etc et al. So test yours to see what works best for it.

review/summary: Perfect for adding flavor to dry food. Our little dog loves this stuff
review/text: I don't know a lot about dogs but I thought they ate anything. The dachshund we had growing up would eat banana peels if you left them out. We rescued a Maltese (5 years ago now) and while he is healthy, he eats when he's hungry and leaves the rest.  He's never like doggy treats, bones etc. and prefers human food/meat to anything for dogs. Since I've read dry food is best for dogs we feed him dry but again, he eats when hungry but doesn't lick his chops. Cesar is the best dog food I've found to add to the dry for taste. We get at least 4 feedings from one container, which make it pretty cheap. We simply mix a spoonful into the dry food for flavor and he's got the best of both worlds. If I could find a dry food tasty enough to be served solo, I would buy it but he eats such a small amount of food I don't mind making it tasty.

review/summary: Dog lickin good
review/text: Our westies love the Caesar Canine Cuisine foods, they seem to prefer the pates to the sauced varieties, but they eat all of them.  I like to give them a big variety of flavors and Caesar's food comes in so many wonderful flavors.  They like this one pretty well, but it isn't one of their favorites.
