review/text: Product was shipped a little slow, also ordered the coffee maker @ the same time--which arrived 5 days  before the coffee did.<br />Product did not taste as good as our previous brand (Maxwell house/Hazelnut) or I would nave given a higher rating.<br />I will try another flavor, since this is a good value @ 21.00 for 50 K-cups.

review/summary: Good flavor, albeit a bit weak
review/text: I have had my Keurig for about half a year now.  I have found that many of the k-cups offered make coffee that is a little too weak.  Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is a little weak, but I know that going in when buying the coffee.  This is a good backup economical backup "cup" for me, and guests that don't like strong coffee.

review/text: After reading over the reviews for several different coffee brands and flavors, I decided to go with Gloria Jeans Hazelnut and I am so pleased that I did. The price is far less then what I was paying at the stores. The flavor is excellent, the boxing and individual k-cups arrived in perfect condition,(I had read that some did not). I am going to set up for the automatic renewal. What more can I say, it works great for me. Thanks again amazon!!

review/text: I purchased this due to the great reviews which usually does me well.  However, compared to other flavored K-cups (i.e. Timothy's German Chocolate Cake), this lacks flavor & sweet notes and tastes burnt.  I would not order this coffee again, and will likely stay away from Gloria Jean's in general.

review/text: I prefer light/flavored coffee, and these coffee cups hit the spot on cold winter mornings. This is the second time I've purchased coffee with frustration-free packaging, and I like the convenience, but there apparently had been a coffee cup that had broken apart during transport, so there was/is coffee all over the cups and the inside of the packaging, so it's been a little messy. The first time I ordered coffee in frustration-free packaging, no such problem occurred, so I think it's just a fluke. I wish more flavored coffee cups came packaged this way--I'd probably buy more if they did.

review/summary: Seems to be the most popular flavored coffee for my family and guests
review/text: I have given over 10 Keurig coffee makers as gifts (I have 6 children and a lot of friends) and I always send variety packs of K-cups with the brewer (beside the one that comes with it).  Of all of the flavored coffees the Hazelnut blends are overwhelming the favorite.  After some trail and error we settled on Gloria Jean's as having the best flavor and richness.  I would suggest making an 8 oz. cup or smaller, especially if you are adding cream to it.<br /><br />I really like Amazon's Frustration-Free packaging.  My favorite K-Cup (I added the product link to it below) also comes in this kind of box and I love it.  I just rip the top off and stick and whole thing in my cabinet. K-Cups produce enough trash as it is so it nice to have fewer boxes when ordering them from Amazon.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]

review/text: The new frustration free packaging for k-cups is terrific! Thank you AMAZON.COM.  Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is one of our favorites for flavored coffee. Second only to their Butter Toffee. However, if you are wanting a bold wake-me-up, this is not going to please you. It's a pretty mild blend. When will someone make a really bold flavored coffee? Surely it is possible. I am a big fan of Emeril's Big Easy for my morning brew but later in the day or after dinner, Gloria Jean's Hazlenut is perfect.

review/text: I see that some reviewers also noted very weak coffee with these, yet some rave about it. I've only tried one box of the GJ's Hazelnut (won't be ordering more). We've bought other Gloria Jean's which are good, such as the Butter Toffee. So, it may be a quality control issue and you may or may not have good luck w/ Hazelnut. I cannot even detect Hazelnut flavor by taste nor a good hazelnut fragrance as this brews (unusual with flavored coffee k-cups). I've tried various sizes - even the small cup setting doesn't produce a flavorful coffee.

review/summary: Well, You Can't Beat the Price!
review/text: Gloria Jean's is the cheap-o brand for the Keurig machine, and it shows.  They've got the honesty to say (on their regular 24-pod box) "with the subtle taste of hazelnut."  Boy, IS it subtle!  Not only is the flavoring weak, but the coffee itself isn't strong at the lowest (6 oz) setting and forget the 8 oz level; you might just as well be reusing pods.<br /><br />When we first got the Keurig, we got it with a selection of Green Mountain coffees.  I thought these were first-class but kind of pricey - you can get Gloria Jean's around here for about $.36 a pod.  This saves a fair amount if you go through 6-8 pods a day, but for the difference in quality, I just don't think it's worth worrying about.  If you have to have your coffee fix so you can get out the door, keep a couple boxes of Gloria Jean's around in case you run out of the good stuff, but don't use it regularly, or you'll find yourself giving up on your Keurig machine!

review/summary: Am I drinking the same blend as the 5-star reviewers?
review/text: I don't know how what I tried could be considered the same as what all the rave reviews are coming in for.<br /><br />When we got our new Keurig brewer for Christmas it came with a sample pack of 12 different coffees.  We were excited for the opportunity to try different blends before purchasing an entire (pricey) box of any one flavor.<br /><br />To preface: I enjoy flavored coffees.  French vanilla, mocha, hazelnut... Pretty much any variety available.  I was really excited to try Gloria Jean's Hazelnut since it was one of the few flavored options in the sample pack.  I typically enjoy smooth medium roasts and I can't stand bitter coffee with a pungent aftertaste.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this brew is without-a-doubt undrinkable.  So bitter and thick.  I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend.  It smelled burnt as soon as it was brewed.  We brewed an 8 ounce cup since typically flavored coffees tend to be weaker so we assumed brewing the smaller size cup would allow us to enjoy to most flavor.  The coffee was dark in appearance and both my boyfriend and I tried it befor dumping it out in the sink because the taste was so foul.<br /><br />Aside from its burnt flavor and bitter aftertaste, it's also worth mentioning that I couldn't detect any hazelnut notes at all.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />I'd never tried a Gloria Jean brand coffee before and now I'm nervous to try another.  I might attempt the Butter Toffee flavor if I can find it in a small pack.  But I'll avoid hazelnut from now on.

review/summary: subscription order
review/text: I have no issue with the product, which I actually love. However, for some reason, Amazon, or whoever is responsible for the shipping, decided to change the method for my last shipment. So, instead of receiving the product within 2 two days via UPS, they started using USPS snail mail, which took forever. I use the "subscription" service for a reason - so that I can count on the timely delivery of coffee and not run out. So, adding 5-6 days to the shipping time caused us to run out and have to make a trip to the store. Not cool. If delivery continues to be inconsistent, then there is no value to ordering this way, and I will go elsewhere.

review/summary: count them!!
review/text: NICE COFFEE, BUT....<br /><br />i like Gloria Jean coffee.  great flavor, not bitter at all.  some people think they are not strong enough, but i think they're perfect.  way better than the bitter stuff you get at starbucks!<br /><br />i ordered this through a promotion and combined it with a subscription and saved a ton of money (paid less than $15 for the box).  just got the package yesterday and i do like the packaging... but because it didn't look like the factory packaging that i usually get, i decided to count the number of k-cups.  THERE WERE ONLY 49!!<br /><br />i called and left a message with DIEDRICH (the name and number were on the box) but i haven't heard from them yet.<br /><br />if they shorted every customer 1 k-cup (yes, i know it's not much, but it's really the principle!), think of how much they'd be saving!  and just how many customers would actually go and count their k-cups before starting to use them?  i normally don't.<br /><br />anyway, i recommend the coffee, but i also recommend you counting them upon receipt.

I thought it may have been a fluke so I tried 2 more times...both times with the same result.<br />To make sure it wasn't my Keurig I tried a different brand of coffee that I had at home and it worked fine, no coffee grinds at all.<br /><br />I don't know what happened, but this lot of GJ Hazelnut is NOT GOOD!!!

review/summary: Great Aroma & Taste, One of My Favorite K-Cups
review/text: If you like other flavored k-cup coffees, you will probably like this one.  This is one of my favorite k-cups.  I think it is a perfect balance of a lightly flavored coffee and superb aroma.  It has a very pleasant hazlenut aroma when it brews (stronger than some other flavors) and tastes like a great coffee with a light hazelnut taste.  This seems more like a medium roast than a light roast if you compare to other flavored coffees and I feel like it has a very nice coffee taste above all else.  I like medium coffees, so I think this one is great.  It isn't like drinking a shot of hazlenut flavoring or like drinking a strong starbucks coffee.  It is just a harmonious light flavor to a good medium coffee.<br /><br />Like other flavored coffees, you should only brew this on the normal default coffee cup size (6oz) on the Keurig brewer or you will water it down if you use the mug size or larger.

review/summary: Great tasting coffee
review/text: Coffee drinkers have very individual tastes, but for my wife and me this is the best tasting hazelnut coffee that we have ordered. It has a nice aroma, distinctive hazelnut taste that is not too weak or too strong, and a very smooth taste (not bitter at all). This is a great coffee to start your day or to enjoy with some cake or pie for dessert.<br /><br />When I ordered the 50 count pack, I didn't realize that the K cups came loose in a big box. That is not a convenient way for me to store them, so next time I will probably order two 24 count boxes that I can stack up in my closet along with the other K cup flavors that I have.<br /><br />The current price on Amazon of $29.99 is about the same as on various internet sites, but as a Prime member I don't pay shipping (as you have to do on the internet sites unless you spend a certain amount that is much more than the cost of this product), so for me it is a good deal.

review/summary: Keurig Hazelnut K-Cups
review/text: Following my recent divorce my ex-wife got custody of the Mr. Coffee machine.  It made no sense for me to get a coffee maker since I drink perhaps one cup of coffee a day at breakfast.  Then a friend introduced me to the Keurig coffee maker.  Very convenient for a single guy, it makes one cup at a time.  And it is very efficient.  The secret is the single serving "K-Cups" which are inserted into the machine.  They come in a huge variety of flavors and the Hazelnut is my personal favorite.  Amazon.com makes it very convenient to order large quantities in a single shipment and they are prompt and reliable in the shipping.  I enjoyed the entire experience of buying and drinking them.  By the way, I also got an assortment of coffee flavors as well as two different kinds of tea (Japanese Green and English Breakfast) and cocoa (which is my daughter's personal favorite).

The coffee is a good strong flavor with enough punch for the casual coffee drinker. I don't want my coffee to taste like unleaded and this fits the bill. The price is unmatched and the packaging is great since I'm not concerned with how it gets to me. I will note that the cups are loose packed and I've noticed 1 in the 10 or so cups I've brewed so far had grounds in the coffee. I'm using a B60 and this makes a good cup in all the different size settings. Amazon please continue to push this packaging/price point to other K-cup vendors. It really makes it an affordable luxury.

How many people leave them in the box anyway? I always unload the cups in to my own storage boxes and coffee caddy.<br />The Hazelnut flavor is one of our favorites.

It's the same Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cup as a regular retail pack, so there is no worries about it being anything else, lower quality or not so perfect k-cup designs. The only difference with this than any other pack/size is that you get 50 in this one cardboard box, so either place it in a k-cup holder rack, or leave it in the box.<br /><br />as for the product itself, its like a mild coffee. if you like your coffee LIGHT AND SWEET, once you add a bit much of cream/milk/hal&half...you taste it more than the coffee itself. The smell is great though when you make the cup...it fills the room with a rich hazelnut aroma.<br /><br />if you like BOLD BOLD BOLD BOLD, go with EXTRA BOLD coffee people k-cups.

My 18 year old daughter who is just starting to drink coffee and was not allowed to have cafeinne at all growing up, loves it. She is at the Sure I like coffee if I can add half a cup of cream and 6 teaspoons of sugar stage of drinking coffee. She does not have to add nearly that aount to this coffee and she really likes it. She is in college and this coffee has become her study buddy. I would say it has a good flavor to it, but if you like a stronger coffee than this is not for you. If you like coffee as long as it does not taste like coffee, then I highly recommend this one. I do like it. It just does not have that coffee taste and does not really get me going. This is a super light blend in my opinion and I do not like super strong coffee. I am picky about flavored coffee and this one just does not taste like coffee to me.

I highly recommend buying these K-Cups from Amazon!

review/summary: Upset with Amazon
review/text: I have a standing order with Amazon for some time now where a case of K cups is shipped to me each and every month at a discounted price.  Amazon has raised their pricing without informing of they're doing so and shipped the case without my approval at the newer higher pricing.  To me, this is bad business and taking advantage of the dedicated consumer.<br /><br />The coffee itself is more than wondeful.

review/summary: If you like grounds in your coffee
review/text: then buy Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cups.  Of the pack of 50 that came in the case, about 20 of them "leaked" grounds into the coffee.  Was only able to identify it before drinking if I put the cream in my mug first.  Otherwise, in black coffee we got our "bonus" unexpectedly.  Never again.

review/text: My wife and I really love the flavor and have been ordering them from Amazon for quite some time. I can't give the coffee a bad review, love it but the description does say 50 k-cups. After reading another review about counting the k-cups, that's just what I did. Opened the package and counted and low and behold there was 48 not 50. Counted three times just to be sure.<br /><br />Mistakes happen and I get that, but I will continue counting with the next few shipments just to be sure.

review/text: I purchased a couple of boxes of this on sale for $3.00 from Kmart. I've been a big fan of the hazelnut coffee at Panera Bread, this tastes even better and I get to make it at home! It's tastes so much better than coffee with hazelnut flavor added. It tastes great with oatmeal, plain bagel, or just to drink while writing an Amazon review. It's yummy and easy to drink, I'm glad I don't have a Keurig with a water tank or else I'd drink to much.
