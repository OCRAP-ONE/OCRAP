review/summary: Forget the Taco Flavored Doritos
review/text: I have to echo Christine's comments. Growing up, Taco Flavored Doritos were my second favorite snack (Hot Fries!). The "retro" chips Lays is pandering now aren't one bit like the original, and they really should be ashamed of themselves for thinking of bringing them back and then giving us something that is not the original.<br /><br />A few years ago, I found the Mexi-Snax Pico de Gallo chips in a local store. I bought it on a whim, and boy am I glad I did. I was in HEAVEN on the first bite! This is very close to what the original Taco Doritos were like. My only complaint is that they are not 100% consistent--sometimes you'll get a batch that doesn't appear to be well-seasoned. Otherwise, it's a fantastic product, and I just hope that the Mexi-Snax company doesn't do something stupid like alter the formula to try to "improve" it or drop it altogether.

review/summary: Quick and apparently yummy toy
review/text: If it lasted, it would be a good chew.  It's a little smelly but compared to a chew-hoof it's Chanel.  Puppy took it from my hand and went straight to work, and it lasted about 20 minutes.  He's a bigger chewer now but at the time he was not the most ferocious, and it would last maybe 8 minutes now.  No mess on the floor - little nibbled bits that stick to your socks - like you get with real bones.  No loose stool either, but there were some FUNKY smells going on in his vicinity a few hours after each bone.<br /><br />For a more durable chew without the stinkies, try an antler.  I'll post a review on those if I can find them in my order history.<br /><br />Based on the dogs I've owned, this would be great for a Sheltie, spaniel, bichon or other small- to midsize- puppy that isn't a serious chewer but needs a job to do to keep him out of trouble.

review/summary: Num num bacon num num
review/text: I bought these bones for my adult dog and a couple of young teething puppies I was fostering.  My adult dog was able to devour these things in no time (I eventually got him the larger sized bones so it would at least last him a good minute instead of seconds).  The puppies loved to chew on these things and were determined to eat them as fast as they could.  When one puppy managed to finish, she would go after her sister's if she still had some left.  These things actually smell good enough that you might almost want to eat one.  haha  They don't last too long but they are a good treat for a dog, especially one who is teething.  They still don't last more than 5 minutes but if you want to spoil your dog, this is a good way to do it.

review/summary: I Love These Say My Dogs
review/text: I bought these during Amazon's 4/3 promotion.  I have two golden retrievers who are spoiled badly and I am constantly looking for healthy treats for them.  These are perfect because I can open one package and have one bone for each dog.  They love these and sit waiting for them.  They are not soft but not like rawhide so when they chew on them, it helps clean their teeth.  There are enough vitamins and flavor to keep them interested until the whole bone is gone.  I would definitely buy again.

review/summary: Dog loved it, until his first bowel movement.
review/text: I am a big fan of treats that are digestable.  I purchased this product thinking it would be safe to feed my dog.  I left the treat for my dog on my way out the door for work, when I arrived home 4 hours later the treat was fully gone and the poor dog could not control his bowel movements and had diarrhea.<br /><br />This diarreha lasted for 2 days, and was so bad that I had to take a trip to the vet which ended up being one of the most expensive trips I've made there yet to have him tested for various illnesses.<br /><br />I didn't attribute the diarrhea to the product at first, but a week later I again gave my dog this bone treat and a few hours after eating the bone the diarrhea started back up again.<br /><br />I'm unsure what exactly about this product is "healthy", and would argue against it being "edible".  Sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it won't require surgery to remove.  But you'll spend 2-3 days dealing with uncontrolable doggy bowel movements, and excessive dehydration.  And if your not quick enough to realize it's this treat causing your problems you'll spend a few hundred bucks at the vets office like I did.<br /><br />And don't get me started on how quickly these things can get eaten....<br /><br />From now on I'll stick with bully sticks.

review/summary: does the job
review/text: For the price, it would be nice if these bones lasted longer, but they do their job so I'm not complaining. I spoke to someone at a pet supply store who recommended these as an alternative to rawhide chews, and he said they're fully digestible, while being good for dogs' teeth and gums. My dog (a 30lb beagle/coonhound) LOVES the bacon flavor, and it keeps him occupied for a little while (probably about a half hour). At this rate, these are a little more expensive than rawhides, and serve the same function, but are safer for your dog, since they are more easily digestible than rawhide. Ultimately, these bones are a pretty nice treat for my dog, but I'll also be looking for some longer-lasting chews to keep him occupied for longer periods.

My two Pom's love them and it is their morning treat.  They won't let forget to give them to them as they make sure they stare me down till I do. lol  They can be eaten without any worry of anything happening to them as they don't contain plastic or any other foreign material. Unless I find a bad review or hear that there is a recall on these, hope there isn't, I will continue to buy these Edibles.  My boys like the bacon flavor the best out of all the different flavors offered.  Amazon also offers a really good price on these.

review/text: My dog is being treated for a condition that requires me to reduce her exercise level to almost nothing.  I'm desperately trying to find treats that will keep her quiet and aren't rawhide.  The vet told me I shouldn't give me dog rawhide on a daily basis, so I decided to try these edible Nylabones.<br /><br />My dog loved how these tasted, but she finished them in a matter of minutes.  The description calls these "edible chews," so I was expecting these bones to keep my dog occupied.  I wouldn't call these bones "chewy" either.  They seem to be slightly tougher than a Milkbone, but just as dry.  I have been a fan of Nylabone products for as long as I can remember.  I raised all my puppies with Nylabones, but these edible Nylabones don't last long enough.<br /><br />On the plus side, my dog did enjoy these treats and they didn't give her an upset stomach (she has a pretty tough stomach though).

May not be the healthiest, as one reviewer said, but seems to make my dogs limited life happier.  Not to mention, most real bacon is loaded with salt, chemicals, and saturated fat...not too healthy either!

review/summary: Read the fine print
review/text: We bought the multi-pack that comes with the standard non-edible nylabones. After 3 minutes of our puppy chewing on this "edible" bone, we got concerned that he had bitten off a chunk of it. To our relief, the bone is technically "edible", but the fine print says for puppies 6 months and older. To me, that's a little misleading. I'd consider a puppy under 6 months old.<br /><br />Our dog passed the 1-inch chunk he'd eaten, but it was his first soft stool in the 6 weeks we've had him. The rest of the bone found its way into the garbage. Nylabone should reconsider selling a multi-pack of these bones mixed with the non-edible style. We were ultra-concerned when handing him a bone that he managed to eat assuming it was the same as the others.<br /><br />My advice, steer clear of these "healthy" edible Nylabones.

review/text: My puppy absolutely loves these! I just wish they lasted longer or came in a bigger pack that was more cost effective - it becomes quite expensive to keep them stocked for him.

review/summary: Very disappointing if you have previously used the plastic Nylabones.
review/text: My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, "natural," flavored bones and thought.... "SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great.

review/summary: My favorite candy - Fresh
review/text: Bit-O-Honey is my favorite candy. The box of 12 packages is perfect to pull out a single, sealed bag once in a while. I ordered one box on two different occasions to keep around. Surprisingly each candy is fresh. I actually thought Bit-O-Honey were supposed to be difficult to chew until I received these. If you like Bit-O-Honey, then both value and freshness will be delivered -- and free of charge when you spend $25.00 or more through Amazon.com. One thing I've found is that several friends love Bit-O-Honey, so they might make good gifts or to share.

review/text: This Bit-O-Honey was the freshest I've ever had in my entire life! The candy was so soft, and I really enjoyed that the candy was in 4 oz. packages. The candy will stay fresher in individual packages. You get between 15 - 20 pieces of candy per package, which is a fair amount, as I only eat 2 or 3 pieces at one time.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to all my family and friends! :)

review/summary: Great snack for a low carb diet - only 80 Cal.
review/text: I am fat, but I'm currently trying to change that. Not being a body builder I wondered if this product was for me, and I was very happy with the results. I keep these with me on days that I can't prepare a meal or when I am tired of my diet food and want something that has a little more hearty flavor. Caveat is: just like turkey-jerky, if you didn't know you were eating ostrich you might think that it tastes a bit different. Keep in mind that ostrich tastes more like chicken than beef.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Compact (will fit in cargo pocket)<br />Tasty<br />Fairly low salt<br />Semi-Moist (good or bad depending on your taste)<br />80 calories<br />Great for diets<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Hard to open sometimes<br />A bit large to fit in pocket (won't fit in standard pants pocket)<br />Co-workers think you are weird to eat Ostrich<br />A little expensive<br /><br />So, with all that said, I keep a box of these in my cupboard at all times just in case I need a snack and I don't want to go off-diet. Buy a box and see what you think.

review/summary: Tasty source of protein
review/text: I didn't order these snack sticks from Amazon, but decided to give my review anyway. I'm required to get 60 grams of protein per day, so I have to be resourceful. I thought I'd try these sticks based on the many positive reviews. At first I was reluctant to eat them because of them being made from ostrich, but I couldn't taste anything different in them. They are delicious! They remind me of Slim Jim's but a lot better. They're not greasy and they're thicker. They are a bit difficult to chew, so be careful about that. Also, they're very filling. I could only eat half a stick at a time. I highly recommend this low-cal, high protein snack.

review/text: I love their Orange flavor coffee, but am very disappointed with the Maple Crunch.  When I opened the bag to transfer the coffee into smaller bags, the smell was almost overpowering.  You have to use lined bags made for coffee if you want to control the smell.  Unfortunately, even with the strong smell, the coffee is amost totally lacking in flavor.  It is also very weak.  I normally grind and brew 7 scoops of coffee.  With this brand, I have gone to 8 and will try 9 next time to see if I can get a decent cup of coffee.  Stick with the Orange or try another brand.

review/text: I used to live on the Hopi reservation. Blue Corn is a big part of their diet.<br />I was hoping this would be like it. It does have the flavor of the blue corn I remember, but the texture is different.<br />The Hopi did a fine grind, like flour, so I was unable to make some of the things I used to make out of it. This texture is rather course and did make good bread.<br />Very excellent quality and you get a lot for what you pay. Next time I am going to go for the fine grind though. I do recommend this as top quality for a more course grind.

review/summary: Not for syrup!
review/text: This may be premature, as I haven't used it for baking, but it definitely has some burnt/beefy tones to it when used to make syrup. We just made three batches of nearly identical syrup...Valrhona, Pernigotti, and Hershey Special Dark. Mix was 1c sugar, 0.5c water, 0.5c cocoa, 1/3 tsp vanilla (the way we make up syrup in our house). The Hershey's was actually just what was left in an older tin, but I figured it would add a baseline (I'm generally not a fan). All three were prepared from a common simple syrup base, and all were whisked the same amount of time and brought to the same temp before taking off the heat.<br /><br />The Hershey's was fine, better than a bottle, but not as good as our usual Bensdorp ( from King Arthur Flour). Pernigotti was the favorite of all three of us, by a good margin.  There were no strident or bitter flavors, and was as close to a dense, liquid chocolate flavor as we've tasted.  The Valrhona was so bad, I'm not sure I'd even use it in milk or on ice cream. Maybe it bakes better?

review/summary: These cookies are just what I was looking for!
review/text: I will first say that I love cookies! However, my downfall with a regular package of cookies is that the package doesn't last very long. I am very into portion control so I was looking for a good snack that would fit this bill. I happen to like fudge striped cookies and when I saw they came in 36 2 ounce bags, I figured that I would try them. They were amazing! One bag satisfied my craving and since there are 36 bags they last a long time. Plus, they are a bargain for the price. I intend to buy more when my supply is gone.

review/summary: GREAT portion-controlled snacks
review/text: EDIT- PRICE DOUBLED in a few months_ these used to sell for $12-$15 a box a few months ago---what's the deal???<br />---------------<br /><br />These cookies are good. They come in a big box and inside there are 36 bags of cookies that are 2 ounces each_that's 4 1/2 pounds of cookies. So that's less than $3 a pound_ these cookies cost $3 for a 12 ounce bag at the store_ so this way is actually less expensive if you're paying the $12 ish that i did. Plus it's easy to control how much you eat. 1 bag is 2 ounces. If i had a regular package of cookies i would probably eat more.<br />Really well packaged- i'm starting my 2nd box and almost zero broken cookies. I did buy again. i will buy again. so i say buy them for yourself too.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I just received these from amazon a few minutes ago and they arrived in perfect condition. The expiration date is not until Oct,5th 2011. I think that is great, you have a long time to eat them & hand them out to your friends family & kids. Also the current price $8.36 is also great. Because these run around $7.50 at Wal-Mart. & the price difference is not that big of a gap under a dollar.

review/summary: Great red bush tea
review/text: I first tried rooibos while in South Africa and fell in love with it. I saw this and thought that since it's organic, I would give it a try. Most red bush teas (aka rooibos) found in the US are either mixed with something (like vanilla) or are incredibly expensive. This is pure rooibos and it tastes that way. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think that it takes quite a while of steeping the tea before it is ready (more than what I tried in South Africa), but since it's organic I just plan ahead. Some drink it with milk and sugar, but I like it with a touch of honey; this one tastes great with both.

review/text: The best part is that it's both organic and free trade.  My batch  didn't have the lovely Jasmine flavor that others have had.  An important bit of advice:  For some reason the usual rice-cooker ratio of about 1 1/2-2 cups water per 1 cup rice didn't hold.  One to one was definitely the right ratio (again, according to the batch I received).

This dish is amazing by itself, or i would recommend accompanying with Vegetable Pulao or you can make your own Rice. I usually serve with Tempe or Tofu. Among the MTR Products i recommend this one, Shahi Paneer Masala, Pav Bhaji, Vegetable Pulao........... actually you know what, i recomment ALL MTR products, the sincerely unique Indian taste surpasses in authenticity compared to Tasty Bite products!<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I was very apprehensive to purchase this product. In the past I found that all the rice based Ready to Eat Indian food (several brands) had either strange aftertastes and/or didn't taste the way they were supposed to. But not this one! I was so delighted with the authentic taste. Vegetables, rice and beans cooked in a spicy sauce. Add some potato chips for a crunchy side accompaniment.<br />If you find this dish a little too thick or too strong, I suggest mixing some cooked white rice. An excellent and tasty purchase.

review/summary: Good Stuff!
review/text: I've eaten my through the majority of ten packages in the last several days.  I find that I seem to like it more each time!  The taste is moderately spicy and quite complex.  This is not a dish I could duplicate easily (if at all) from scratch ingredients.<br /><br />I microwave it in a bowl for 90 seconds, being sure to cover the bowl since this stuff tends to "pop" and splatter a lot.  Mixing in a few spoonfuls of water before cooking seems to make it more enjoyable and bring out the tomato flavor.<br /><br />The package suggests that it serves two but that's assuming it's served with something else.  I find myself wanting something else to go with it, perhaps something sweeter or less spicy, when I eat a package all by itself.

review/summary: Good alternative to fresh
review/text: Having lived in CA I was dismayed to find the produce in the DC area less than appealing, particularly the citrus. So on a whim, I purchased these cans and was very pleasantly surprised. This is not quite like a fresh grapefruit but it's extremely refreshing and MUCH better than the "fruit" that can be found in many local groceries. Because I prefer a less sweet i.e. more natural tasting product, I left a can in the fridge overnight. The next day I drained off the syrup and dumped the fruit into a bowl filled with water to chill for a few hours . The result was really quite wonderful. The fruit retains just the right sweetness from its initial bath while the water in the bowl takes on a mellow fruit flavor that is delicious and fragrant. Again, I would recommend the rinse but it's a personal preference. The syrup is not cloyingly sweet but I do think that the water bath/soak produces a more refreshing final product.

review/text: Roland does a great job canning fruits (not cooked vegetables though) and this grapefruit mix is no exception.....it's delicious!  It's packed in light syrup that tastes like its the juices from the grapefruit themselves.  I only occasionally found a seed or piece of the white inner rind....the rest was pure, clean, ready to eat delicious grapefruits.  Plus, the fruit tastes like it's really fresh and picked and canned at the peak of ripeness.  I love just eating these grapefruits right out of the can for an afternoon snack.  They are sweet like the red grapefruits always are even though there are white one included in the cans too.  These make great low calorie deserts or snacks.  If you like fruits, you'll like these cans of grapefruits....give them a try!
