review/summary: Lovely variety of sea veggies
review/text: I really liked these sea vegetables (I use them in home-made miso soup). The price is a bit high (I'd feel better with a $5-$7 reduction in the price), but the quality is great. I love the fact that these are 6 different species included, to provide different vitamins and minerals. Unfortunately though, the various species are not included in equal proportions, so some flavors overpower others.

review/summary: Truly great coffee.
review/text: This is a truly great coffee w/a strong chocolate aroma, but little to no chocolate flavor. Probably overlooked by most because it is Vietnamese. Just think about how long the French occupied Vietnam and you can only begin to understand how great this coffee is.

review/summary: Tasty Coffee!
review/text: This coffee is absolutely fantastic.  Yes - it's true that it's not the whole beans waiting to be ground, and I usually grind my own, but the flavor is truly amazing.<br />It has notes of chocolate and spice.  It is rich and so so tasty. I'm quite honestly a coffee snob and a bit of a foodie.<br />Of course if you like folgers, this isn't going to work for you... move along lol.<br /><br />I've been running it in my espresso / cappuccino machine.<br />Just make sure to pack it extra hard so that it flows properly.<br />Add some raw sugar and a little half and half cream.<br />You then have an incredible tasting coffee.<br /><br />I liked this so much after my first box, that I ordered 3 more boxes.<br />Each box comes with 2 mini bags in it that have co2 reducers.

review/summary: great coffee, but not the flavor Im looking for for ca phe sua da
review/text: Im not a coffee connoisseur at all and cant tell the difference between harbucks or mcdowels, but I do know the taste of ca phe sua da in socal and have been casually engaged in finding the right blend.  The oft recommended, Cafe du Monde, is definitely not the flavor.  Im not sure what chicory is, but its a funny tasting coffee, fairly mild, and no matter how long I try to filter it to get it stronger/darker, the coffee just isnt the right amount of blackness.  So I turned to Trung Nguyen, and based on recommendations from internet, friends, and the website itself, this is one of (if not the) most popular blend.  Its got a great flavor full of nuttiness and sure presses better than du Monde (almost no grounds at bottom of cup), but its still not the ca phe sua da Im used to.  For one, the color is a definite brown, not black and it isnt strong.  Ill give the Creative #1 a try which says its a dark and strong robusta coffee (no blend), compared to this which is a blend of nearly everything.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a great tasting coffee full of complex flavors that are beyond what I can describe, give this a try... you wont be disappointed to the least.  But, if you are looking for that really strong, jet black coffee that can strip paint off a car and wake up dirt, and that when mixed with condensed milk turns into a rich golden-brown concoction that is ca phe sua da, then you need to look elsewhere (like that Creative #1... possibly).

review/text: Trung Nguyen Gourmet Blend does not disappoint. It's the closest I've found to the blend of Trung Nguyen that is sold locally in Vietnam.<br />Do yourself a favor and buy some now. That, and a can of good sweetened condensed milk. Brew it the traditional way, and you be in coffee heaven just like I am now!<br /><br />The only disappointing side to this review is the cost of this particular blend is not always easy to find, and the price is continually increasing.

review/summary: BEST COFFEE EVER!!
review/text: I am an avid coffee drinker as I have tried different blends from different country. This little-known Trung Nguyen blend is definitely the BEST coffee ever! Forget about black coffee from hipsters-filled Starbucks and those so-called gourmet blends from D&D. Black coffee is supposed to be bold, rich in taste, and refreshing! Most coffee that you have tried are bland, sour, and SOUR. If you want the taste of real coffee, you've got to try this.<br />Protip: Asian supermarkets in Socal have these boxes for only $6/each. Also, buy a Vietnamese coffee filter because it's the best when it comes to extracting the goods from coffee.

review/summary: Not a fan of the cocoa taste
review/text: I would consider this strong coffee, but what is also strong is the smell and taste of cocoa.  I would even say that this is very similar to the flavored coffee ("cocoa or chocolate" flavored) I have tried in the past and not a regular blend coffee at all.  As such, I cannot recommend this coffee at all.

review/text: I am an adult and I still love this cereal. It is a great deal, but ONLY from the Amazon.com seller. It is currently sold out from amazon and some other sellers have it for much higher prices, which are not worth buying. But overall, I cannot say enough good things about this cereal. When I was younger, I used to eat a whole bowl of just the marshmallows because I loved them so much. Now, I eat the cereal the way it was intended, and I love it so much. Highly recommend. :-)

review/summary: Prices change here alot, sometimes good deal, sometimes bad deal
review/text: Of course, I like this cereal, it's like frosted cheerios with marshmallows, but I wanted to review the internet buying option. Most food products, especially candy, is a rip-off from most Amazon sellers. However, the cereal is usually cheap. I think the 11.5oz was about $2.60 at Wal-Mart, but I paid  only $6.86 for the 1 package of 3 boxes here on Amazon, so that is about $2.29 for each box. That was a good deal, but now the page says $15 for 3 boxes, which is $5 a box. That is a rip for the 11.5oz box; you can get a 16oz box for only about $3.00 at Wal-Mart. So you have to watch the prices to see if it's cheaper or not.<br /><br />I was worried about the cereal not being fresh, but it is. My Lucky Charms were the new ones with the new marshmallows in them; currently it's the different colors of shooting stars. My boxes from Amazon have the same expiration date as the Frosted Flakes I bought at Wal-Mart, so that's a good thing. They taste good too (just in case there is other problems that could be wrong with them).<br /><br />So overall, check the prices to see if it is worth it, the prices change both in the store and online, alot (mostly they change online, though). I bought from here like a month ago, but wouldn't buy them this second, probably would, again, in the future, though.

review/summary: Best Hot Pepper Sauce EVER!!
review/text: My household was going through 2 - 3 regular 5 oz bottles per month since discovering the best pepper sauce ever and were delighted to find this one gallon jug.  Even with the coupons I got in the paper and online this is a major money saver!  With a small funnel is easy to pour into the small Tabasco bottle.  We eat it on nearly anything and everything...latino foods, burgers, pizza, eggs (hard boiled, scrambled, fried, pickled), grilled cheese sandwiches, baked or grilled chicken, wings, steak, pork chops, and so on.<br /><br />Just like another reviewer I had never really been a huge fan on Tabasco.  My husband regularly used the original, and I liked the milder green on latino foods, but then I tried the new chipotle flavor and want to put it on everything.  It is SO YUMMY.  My mouth is watering just writing this review.  Mmmmm...<br /><br />P.S.  I ordered mine from Tabasco's website vs. Amazon.  The shipping was $5 cheaper on their site, plus I found a $5 off promo code online :)

review/summary: The Best...
review/text: I am a fan of spices... No one has what Tabasco has. The healthiest out there. Only 30 mg of salt per spoon. Others not only cannot compete with Tabasco's taste but they have 200 plus mg of salt in each spoon. That is ridiculous amount of salt. Do not need to refrigerate the Tabasco bottle for one year at all so you can leave it outside at room temperature.  I have been using Tabasco for 40 years all over the world. I add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNS55A">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red Gallon</a> to all my dishes since it is the spiciest of all. It is not thick like the Chipotle but it is very unique test when I am making dishes that have many different ingredients since it mixes well. I add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNZRKQ">TABASCO brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> to the tortilla pizza that I make with cheese and herring since this is heavier and tastier but not as spicy as the original red or green. I add the green <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNQV2Y">TABASCO brand Green Jalapeno Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> with anything that I make with eggs including the egg sandwich in between tortillas since this is the best with eggs. I love beans and lintels so after cooking those I add serrano chilli pepper deeped in Italian vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, eggplant and the Habanero <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HO0F1Q">TABASCO brand Habanero Sauce - Gallon</a> and I can tell you that becomes real hot. I place the mix in between hot tortilla with avocados for consumption. Now that does not mean that I am limited with these food selections since many times I may mix all those Tabascos together. Regardless, I have never been disappointed since it is truly delicious, spicy, hot without all the garbage and additives that it is out there in other brands without the taste. I have a very healthy diet and I consume healthy food without additives. Thanks and Double bravo to Tabasco.

review/summary: Rip Off, Gross
review/text: I purchased these in lieu of the V8 Fusions since they sell for $2.08 per can on Amazon Marketplace (approx double the price Safeway sells them for).  First of all, they only contain 10% juice and the first ingredient after water is High Fructose Corn Syrup.  They essentially sold me Soda with a V8 label on it!  If I wanted to buy pop, I'd get a 24 pack for $8 not $30! Honestly, if you want juice, go to your local grocery store.  These are terrible for you, over priced and they taste horrible.  I would've sent them back but I figured I'd give it a try.  Now im out $30.  This left a bad taste in my mouth in more ways than one.  Oh!  I should also mention that these did not arrive in a 'weather-resistant tote' but rather were delivered to me in the original packaging.  The plastic was loose and a can fell out when I carried it in.  Not using Amazon marketplace again!

review/text: This is the food my vet recommends.  It is produced about 40 or 50 miles away from where I live, and they source only local ingredients, nothing comes from China.  So it is a food I feel very comfortable with, I know that this company cares about my pet's health and takes it seriously.  And it is very reasonably priced at one of my local pet food stores.  Now, there are those who would point to the oats and vegetables and declare it unacceptable.  But my cat never throws up or has diarrhea with Eagle Pack.  He seems to do best on the Lamb variety and the Duck variety.  The Turkey one gave him slightly softer stools for some reason.  I think the price and quality make us both happy, for now.  I'd love to feed him the optimal diet (probably raw) but I still have some reservations about it that I would have to come to terms with, so for now, we're sticking with this.

review/summary: where's the Beef? It's "NOT" like the picture on the can!
review/text: And where's the vegetable's while your at it? The last 3 or 4 cans of this that I've had has only had 5 or 6 little bits of beef in them. This last one was mostly carrots. It should have been called "Carrots in Beef Broth" Soup. It only had 6 pieces of meat and 5 or 6 little chunks of potato with about 20 pieces of carrots. I usually dump a handful of frozen sweet corn or peas in it and a handful of instant rice to help fill it out. But this time I was out of frozen veggies so I got to see just what ISN'T in the soup. Like there's more stuff missing than in it. Once I finish off the cans that I have left I sure ain't going to waist any more of my money on it.<br /><br />I scanned and uploaded the ingredients on the label from one of the smaller microwavable cans of the same Chunky Beef Soup. What I have got OUT of the can sure ain't like the picture ON the can!

review/text: This is by far the best coffee I've ever had. If you don't want to be addicted to a particular brand/flavor, then do not try this. Otherwise, you will be hooked. I have also tried their cinnamon blend, which I did not care for as much (seemed to be too strong of a cinnamon flavor, and I love cinnamon). Check out prices at their website first though, as they may be cheaper there.

review/text: The listing of this item is a bit unclear. It is a six pack, which means it comes as six boxes, each with 8 packages of cereal for a total of 48 packages.<br /><br />The cereal is of fine quality. When my wife tasted a sample, she immediately said "I could eat this every day." Which is why I bought it. As for myself, I think it's a bit bland, but I have a sweet tooth.

review/summary: Only oatmeal we like -- no other will do
review/text: I grew up "doctoring" my mother's oatmeal with massive amounts of brown sugar. Then breakfast hot cereal makers started adding sweeteners, which at first, seemed OK, but as I grew less needy of the morning sugar fix, they all seemed too sweet. This is a perfect blend of taste and fiber for both my husband and I, who buy it two boxes at a time and always seem to run out. Great for traveling, camping, or using as a "safe food" after a bout with the flu or stomach problems.

review/summary: healthy, lightly sweet instant oatmeal
review/text: I enjoy many of the Kashi brand items, so I thought I would give this one a try. The flavor is light and not too sweet, which I didn't mind. But I noticed two things that put me off a bit: 1) orange bits, like tiny pieces of carrot, and 2) grittiness. I know Kashi adds healthy extras to their products, but the texture was not something I was used to.

review/text: Very very good oatmeal. I bought this because I couldn't find the Apple cinnamon Kashi at my local store and thought maybe this would taste good even though it doesn't have anything in it (Amazon says it has raisins in the description, no it doesn't.). Anyways this oatmeal is very good, it's not overly sweet at all like Quakers oatmeal, but it's still sweet and not bland. I add my OWN raisins to this to get some extra texture in there and it works out great. It's way better than the apple cinnamon kind.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This is roughly a two month supply of breakfast for a single person who eats oatmeal every morning...at a pretty decent price for prepackaged cereal.  Use subscribe and save, and it's even less expensive!<br /><br />We've found that this tastes better than most other flavored oatmeal out there: most are too sickeningly sweet, and have an artifical taste to them.  The Kashi brand is not too sweet, and cooks easily in the microwave.  (I tend to use a little bit less water than recommended.)  Personally I don't find any oatmeal all that filling, but my wife does.<br /><br />Also, she recommends oatmeal to any nursing mother and claims that it will increase breastmilk supply.<br /><br />The green tea is a neat idea, since it's supposed to be "healthy," but we really don't notice it: we don't notice any green tea taste, nor do we notice any caffeine effect.  I'll bet it's 99% marketing anyway.  They probably wave a green tea bag over the box as it's going out the factory or something.<br /><br />Hope you enjoyed my review!

I like the quality--when I compare ingredients on this package to other quick oatmeal products, this brand has better quality ingredients. It is also vitamin fortified, which many other oatmeals are not. It would be even better if it had just a little less sugar--12 gr is kind of a lot, 2-1/2 teaspoons.

review/summary: This oatmeal is horrible!!!
review/text: Review is for the apple cinnamon variety, but I am sure that many ingredients are the same -<br /><br />I bought this oatmeal to eat at work, thinking it would be healthier than the typical Quakers oatmeal.  I immediately noticed that it wasn't as sweet, but then I noticed that it was giving me headaches and making me jittery too.  I thought - well, it's probably because my body is expecting sugar, and isn't getting enough from this brand.<br /><br />Today I took a few spoonfuls and it was so awful again - I decided to read the ingredients list.  I get a bad reaction to sweeteners, but I thought - the box said all natural, there can't be artificial sweeteners in this ... Little did I know there are two decaffeinated teas in the ingredients (decaf has 30% of the caffeine of regular tea) that's what was probably causing my jittery feelings, and there is plenty of garbage artifical ingredients in here including guar gum and "Activin grape seed extract" - what???  I am guessing that some of the sweeters that I am quasi-allergic to are in here as well.<br /><br />Basically this product is misleading, tastes gross, and can probably cause bad reactions in many people that don't react well to the loads of caffeine and lots of other artificial ingredients listed in the ingredients list.  I can't believe that so many people rated it well - maybe they are related to the owners of the brand.

review/summary: The best Turkish tea we could find in the US
review/text: When we visited Turkey last Xmas, we drank straight or honey-sweetened Turkish tea along with delicious baklava several times a day to make up for the cold. My boys fell in love with Turkish tea there. Back home, we tried to find some good Turkish tea. I ordered several kinds. After doing thorough testing (!!) we decided that this was the best tea among the 4 kinds we sampled!<br /><br />The taste: very clean and pure. A light, well pitched, fragrant component. A hint of sweetness in the background.<br /><br />We brew it in a cast iron Japanese tea kettle, pour boiling water in it, then dilute it in the glass or mug to the concentration we want. Purists beware: we often sweeten it with honey, and I typically add a drop of lemon:-)

review/text: I have been drinking this tea for years and I am happy with the exquisite taste that comes from naturally grown Black Sea region tea. No pesticides/chemicals have been used in growing this tea, it is pure, it is natural, it is rich in taste and above all it is healthy.<br /><br />It is produced by CAYKUR (Rize,Black Sea Region,Turkey), Turkey's government enterprise for tea-processing.<br /><br />Caykur's Altinbas is usually priced higher than other Caykur brands.<br /><br />It is loose tea so you need to have a set of two teapots, one at the bottom for boiling water and one at the top for brewing tea.

review/summary: Prices for Turkish Teas on Amazon.com are too high !!!
review/text: I think I can call myself a good Turkish Tea drinker. If you are not familiar with any of these teas, choose the cheapest one, which is the Yellow box (Turist) in general. It will give you 80-90% the same taste. The pink/red box (Filiz) is supposed to be the next better one, while it is the most favorite choice for many Turkish tea lowers. The red box (Cay Cicegi) is presented as better and stronger than Filiz, and the black box (Altinbas) is best among these four tea types. However, the prices on Amazon.com are at least double of what you can find at your local ethnic food stores. See if you can find any local stores if possible. Once you find a local merchant, you will find more choices to buy with tea, like Turkish delight, baklava, halva, Turkish cookies, white (feta) cheese, black/green olives, sudjook, and much more. If you come accross Turkish from brands other than Caykur, try to choose Caykur brand.

review/summary: Clear, beautiful tea--some hints on brewing
review/text: This is the same Turkish tea you can drink in kebab establishments in Europe. It's typically served in tiny, tulip-shaped glasses on small saucers. On a cold day, it's really warming, and it's even refreshing in summer.<br /><br />This tea is brewed in a two-part teapot, typically stainless steel with a big pitcher below for hot water and a smaller teapot on top for brewing a strong infusion of the tea. You set the teapot on top of the hot water to brew, then use the hot water to dilute the tea to desired strength. This is similar to the way Russian tea is brewed in a samovar.<br /><br />One thing about this tea; there is a lot of tea leaf dust in the package. To avoid a sort of off flavor contributed by the dust, it's easy to wash the leaves before brewing. I put the tea into a tea strainer, pour hot water over the leaves and discard the water. The leaves go into the pot for brewing. This really improves the flavor. It's not unusual to "wash" tea leaves; in China, tea is often made by throwing off the first water infusion and quickly re-infusing the wet leaves.<br /><br />The flavor of this tea is more like Russian or China black tea--less snappy and tannic than Assam or Darjeeling.

review/summary: Outstanding snack at less than Walmart! Made in USA!
review/text: I bought some Good Sense sunflower nuts at Walmart and really liked them. They were 1.68. I was glad to find them on Amazon in a 12 pack for 16.98. Not only was it like getting 2 free when you buy a dozen, free 2 day shipping on Amazon Prime; our "local" Walmart store is 40 miles away. If you don't have Prime, it's well worth it for us.<br /><br />The quality of these sunflower kernels is outstanding! Fresh,a bit sweet touch of salt not coated like some honey roasted peanuts tend to be. Very refreshing and a healthy addition to your diet.<br /><br />These are produced in New Hope, MN. Right in the heart of the Midwest. I'm sure from farm fields around the area. Great to see a health snack made right here from local sources.<br /><br />Give these a try. I'm sure you will enjoy them as much as my bride and I.<br /><br />Update: The price has gone up from 16.98/12 and found they are selling for 1.00 at Menard's up here in the midwest. Walmart was at 1.68 ea. Great product but might want to shop around for the best price. Prime is a good deal if the price is fair. Over 20.00/12 seems bit too high for me.

review/text: Delicious sunflower nuts, I mix the Honey Roasted with the Unsalted<br /><br />I have tried most of the varieties of Good Sense Sunflower Nuts, and have enjoyed them all.  My two favorites--so far--are the Honey Roasted & Unsalted.  But I have found that a 50/50 mix of these two varieties is what I enjoy most.  The mixture is the just right compromise.

review/text: I'm not a fan of fruit flavored sodas, usually I find them to be too sweet. Thankfully this wasn't overly sweet, but I still don't think it's something I would drink on a regular basis. I tend to prefer my fruit drinks to just be the fruit juice. I don't need the added carbonation added to the drink.

review/summary: Switch Fruit Juice
review/text: The Switch is not a soda -- it's fruit juice with carbonation. Still, drinking it is very much like drinking a soda, but you get your Vitamin C. I found the balance of sweetness and carbonation to be good, although just a little more carbonation would give this an added zip.<br /><br />What I especially like about this product is that it is all natural and there is no high-fructose corn syrup in the drink. However, this is not a low-calorie beverage, and the 8.3 ounce can had more than 100 calories. If you are going to include this product in your diet, be aware of that. It is fruit juice -- and yes, it has the calories. But this is a food and not just empty soda calories.<br /><br />I gave this flavor 4 stars because I found the kiwi flavor somewhat lacking. It's not bad, I just think the apple juice was more noticeable, although the strawberry flavor came through nicely. A stronger kiwi-strawberry flavor would have gotten 5 stars.<br /><br />As for the can, I found the zip tab a little difficult to open because of the proximity of the ring to the edge of the can. But I'm a bit of a klutz; I have problems with potato chip bags. So take this caveat with a grain of salt. I think the manufacturer has found a good size for the cans, because you get just enough of the drink to feel like you've had a treat, but not so much that the calorie count is on overkill.

review/summary: Neutral - my preferances weighed heavily
review/text: I tried the Switch Kiwi Berry drink along with the Switch Black Cherry drink.  I'll review them together because there isn't that much to write about.<br /><br />First, I'll admit a little bias.  I'm not a fan of sugar-based drinks.  I drink diet pop, Crystal Light drinks, and I use saccharin, aspartame, and sucralose.  I find sugar-based drinks generally "gummy", although carbonated drinks are somewhat preferable to non-carbonated drinks.  While there is "no sugar added" to these drinks, the fruit juice itself is quite full of sugar.<br /><br />The Switch brand drinks are lightly carbonated, which helps them in my opinion - others may disagree.  The gumminess is still there, though.  The fruit flavor is not strong enough to overcome this and I found that I needed this drink to be extremely cold (as in near frozen) to enjoy it.  I did not like the aluminum can for this product either.  I find that fruit-flavored drinks seem to latch onto the aluminum flavor more than other drinks.<br /><br />My personal preference was for the Black Cherry, but others may like the Kiwi Berry.  I can't recommend this as a net positive, but my preferences might adversely reflect here - I'll rate it as neutral.  If you feel your tastes are similar to mine, you should probably forgo this one.

review/summary: Enjoyable Alternative to Soda
review/text: Switch, with it's 100% RDA of Vitamin C, and it's lack of added sugar, corn syrup, or preservatives, is not only healthy, but it has the nice twist of carbonation to appeal to soda drinkers young and old.<br /><br />This is a great beverage for soda-lovers--children and adults alike, as well as for health foodies looking for something a little different. It's an especially great product for kids, because they think they are getting soda, but it's really just fancy juice that's (GULP!) good for them!<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry flavor is sweet, but it's a natural flavor that derives its sweetness from fruit juices. Overall, it's definitely an enjoyable product.

review/summary: Tasty, but I wouldn't drive out of my way for it
review/text: Last year I tasted several of the Izze fruit drinks for the first time and became addicted.  I have an affinity for fruity foods and beverages, and that fact combined with my positive experiences with Izze prompted me to try THE SWITCH.<br /><br />I'll say it right off the bat - THE SWITCH was okay, but it doesn't really compare in taste to Izze.  If I had never tasted Izze, I might enjoy THE SWITCH more.  As it is, I thought it was tasty enough, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to get it.  If I were in the convenience store looking for a refreshing fruity beverage, I might buy it again.<br /><br />I tried two different flavors of THE SWITCH, and the Kiwi Berry was my least favorite of the two flavors (the other was Black Cherry).  The kiwi berry flavor was nice, but a little bit muddled for me.  However, the fruit flavors did taste natural - I just think I would have preferred a simple Kiwi flavor instead of the blend.<br /><br />To sum up, I think THE SWITCH is a nice alternative to sodas, although a little pricier than colas are.  It is a refreshing fruit beverage, but there are other brands that have a tastier flavor.<br /><br />If Amazon allowed half-star ratings, I would give this 3.5 stars.

review/summary: Tasty But Gimmicky
review/text: I have tried a couple of the other Switch flavors, and I found them to be very disappointing.  This variety, on the other hand, had excellent Kiwi and Strawberry flavors.  However, I emphasize FLAVORS because that is where the Switch drinks get gimmicky.  They are all marketed under the flavors/juices that appear WAY DOWN on the ingredient listing.  The several varieties that I have tried all have apple and white grape juice as the top ingredients.  This seems like false advertising to me, since those juices are clearly not as appealing.  Anyway, this drink is all about the marketing.  The price you are paying for 8 ounces of carbonated juice is clearly an extravagance, and I wouldn't do it again.  Save yourself some money and visit the juice aisle at the grocery store.

The Kiwi Berry is also tasty, though for the life of me I couldn't taste the kiwi -- just strawberry.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry has the same problem as the Black Cherry, however; just SO much sugar! Ounce for ounce, it's as much sugar as in a regular, non-diet soda. I'd definitely drink any of the Switch products again ... but I won't try to convince myself it's a health drink!

review/summary: Tasty alternative to cola, but still overly sweet and syrupy
review/text: I decided to try the Switch Kiwi Berry drink because I'm trying to find tasty alternatives to regular cola and I don't like most artificially sweetened drinks. Switch did a great job with the kiwi and strawberry flavor of this beverage, but I can't shake the feeling that it's a drink that is pretending to be healthy even when it's not.<br /><br />The Switch can states this drink is made with 100% Juice, all natural, with no sugar added and no corn syrup. That must make it healthy, right? Wrong. This tiny 8.3 ounce can packs 135 calories and 33 grams of sugar! How is that possible? Switch uses fruit "juice concentrate" which is just a nice way of saying they process fruit into a sugar syrup and remove almost everything that makes juice healthy in the process. Juice concentrate is barely any better than corn syrup.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is a very tasty drink, but don't buy it if you're looking for a healthy beverage.

review/summary: The Switch Kiwi Berry
review/text: Like the other flavors of The Switch, Kiwi Berry is sweetened with a mixture of fruit juice concentrates which can lend to it's overly sweet taste. Although this flavor wasn't as sweet as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, for me it wasn't as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Although I can't see buying this drink for myself, my kids do like it.  I think The Switch might be best billed as a healthy alternative to soda for kids mainly because the flavors are much more geared towards that age group.

review/summary: All Natural, Light Carbonation, Great Taste
review/text: The Switch Kiwi Berry is a reasonable alternative for soda pop drinkers who want a more natural alternative and the juice drinkers who want something with a bit more fizz.<br /><br />The taste is somewhere between apple and strawberry though kiwi juice is in the ingredients (maybe I just don't know how kiwi juice tastes!).<br /><br />*** Positive Points Include: ***<br /><br />- Light Carbonation<br />- Made from 100% juice (blend of apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, rasberry, and strawberry, with a bit of vitamin c added.<br /><br />*** Negative Points Include: ***<br /><br />- A bit on the sweet side, then again most juices are<br />- Not a low sugar drink with about 33 grams of sugar<br />- Somewhat high price<br /><br />Overall this should be a good alternative drink for kids who cant seem to kick their soda pop habit.  The carbonation is much lighter than regular soda pop so the damage to teeth will be much less while providing 100% fruit juice.

review/summary: A unique go-between...
review/text: Is it a juice or is it a soda?  It's both!  Switch Kiwi Berry canned beverage has enough carbonation for it to be "soda-like" but it's not overpowering.  This particular flavor is made up of a variety of fruit juices, and I really didn't taste too much kiwi or strawberry.  To me, the apple juice flavor was the dominant one.  I like fruit juices and different beverage choices, and I really like the texture of this drink.  However, it is a bit too sweet for my liking and is pretty high in calories.  If the calorie count had been lower, my rating would be higher.  Children would probably really enjoy this drink, and it's definitely a healthier option than soft drinks or other sugary options.  I'd be interested to try some of the other flavors!

review/text: SWITCH KIWI BERRY carbonated juice is a pleasant surprise.  Although I don't drink carbonated juices as much as I used to, I have been disappointed in the few that I have had in the past year.<br /><br />KIWI BERRY SWITCH is a nice carbonated juice.  The bubbles are very fine.  The flavor is not too syrupy, but with lots of impact.  I can taste the strawberry and the kiwi, but it is not overwhelming.  There is a touch of raspberry that I find stronger than the strawberry or kiwi.  I can taste the apple and grape slightly but the berry is much stronger and does not fight with it.<br /><br />There is only 8.3oz per can which can be good and can be bad.  I like it because I rarely want a big can of anything, so it is a nice size for me.  For a thirsty person on a hot day, one will not be enough.<br /><br />This juice stands up to some ice too without becoming flavorless which I also like.

review/summary: A Very Sweet Treat
review/text: The Switch Kiwi Berry was a good drink. I thought it was a little too sweet for my taste, but not by much. One serving size was 8.3 fluid ounces. It contains 33 grams of sugar and 34 grams of carbs per serving, and each serving was 135 calories. According to the label, it contains 100% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C. The drink has a slight carbonation to it that was a lot less than soda. The small and skinny can makes it good for inclusion in a lunch box.<br /><br />Although I liked it, I don't think it's worth the price of nearly $1 a can. But for the convenience of size, it might be worth the trade-off on occasion.

review/summary: Tastes good. Simple ingredients.
review/text: The Switch in Kiwi Berry is a good tasting carbonated drink. It's fruity sweet with a bit of tang.<br /><br />We have made our own carbonated juice or punch drinks in the past using a home carbonating gadget. While it's not hard to do this, we can only make limited quantities and it's not very portable. But we love the results.<br /><br />The Switch took this same idea and packaged in their rather smallish cans. (Good size for kids, a bit too small for adults.) I'm still concerned with the sugar involved. At 35 grams a can, it still seems a bit much. But there is no caffeine, no added corn syrup, no added sugar, or other ingredients normally found in colas.<br /><br />But for what it is, The Switch soda is quite tasty. It's a great alternative to standard sodas out there. (Water is still best!)

review/summary: A Tasty Alternative to Soda ...
review/text: Allow me to say that my situation may be different from yours. I have been a vegetarian since childhood and have perpetually experimented with all sorts of crazy foods -- so my pallet is accustom to more "natural" flavors.<br /><br />I have struggled for years to break my soda habit (besides the high-fructose corn syrup there are a number of other ingredients I'm simply not comfortable putting in my body). (And, Dr. Oz has been fairly forthcoming in saying that these products promote free radicals which hurry the aging process). Switch gave me the carbonation and sweet taste that I crave. No, it's not my favorite Mountain Dew ... but it's a good second-place and a wildly better choice.<br /><br />Some people are complaining about the calories (140 a can). For me (and maybe you), that's not a concern. What impresses me is that this drink is 100% juice. Why drink empty calories when you can fuel your body with goodness?<br /><br />Bottom-line: this product may surprise you! It has a pleasant flavor, is lightly carbonated, and crushed my desire for soda. I must admit, I am a fan!!

review/text: I like this 'Kiwi Berry' more than the 'Watermelon Strawberry' I reviewed previously: it's less sweet, but still a little too sweet for me.  It advertises 'no sugar added' and '100% juice carbonated', so I was expecting somewhat sweet tasting, but not like this ~ it was too sweet, and packed 135 calories, 36g sugar and 34g carbs in a 'no sugar added'-'no corn syrup'- 'no preservatives'-'no artificial colors'-'gluten free' drink!  I would expect that from a juice like apple or cranberry, but I would also expect it to TASTE natural, and this one (for all it's claims to the contrary) STILL did NOT taste very natural to me.<br /><br />It was certainly pleasant tasting, but for the tastebuds of someone who WAS a lifelong soda drinker (diet soda for the past 12 years), and gave up soda completely last May (I don't miss it at all!), this is not the drink for me.  I mostly drink water, milk, iced tea, hot tea & coffee now, and this sweet tasting, sugary tasting beverage, had way too much carbonation & flavoring for me!  The kiwi berry flavors were nice (much nicer than the watermelon strawberry), but still TASTED fake, which is weird for a drink that touts things like '100% juice' and a label that says 'natural flavors'...I would recommend this product only to those who like sweet, fruitie carbonated beverages, and aren't too worried about calories, etc.

review/summary: Your Body Will be Glad You Made the Switch
review/text: Switch Kiwi Berry is a good tasting, lightly carbonated fruit beverage that offers the great taste of natural fruit juice without any preservatives or man- made chemicals. Switch blends fruit juice concentrates with just the right amount of carbonation for a balance that is refreshing without being too bubbly.<br /><br />Switch manufactures several different flavors of its beverages and kiwi berry is one of several fruit- flavored options. I tend to prefer the taste of citrus, but I love the taste of berries also, provided the blend is just right. Switch Kiwi Berry offers a very good- tasting blend that captures flavors like strawberry and kiwi, along with apple, grape, raspberry, and other natural flavors. The kiwi and the strawberry are most noticeable, but if you search, you will also realize there is a small amount of grape, apple, and other fruits to produce the right balance and right smoothness.<br /><br />Switch Kiwi Berry is great for those who are concerned about their health. This beverage is all natural, contains no preservatives, no added sugar, no corn syrup, no artificial colors, and no gluten. Of course, the fact that there is no added sugar doesn't mean that no sugar exists. There is actually a pretty significant number of grams of natural sugar in each serving, as well as a significant number of calories. These numbers will make Switch unacceptable to those on low carb diets.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, however, Switch Kiwi Berry is a very tasty beverage with lots of sweet berry taste, a full day's supply of vitamin C, and no preservatives. It offers all- natural composition with a taste that is sweet and satisfying and a carbonation level that is just enough to make it refreshing without going overboard.

review/summary: Pleasant Taste if a Little Too Sweet
review/text: I was intrigued by this product.  Once it arrived, my son was as well.  So, I shared it and anothere flavor with him.  My assessment was that it has a pleasant taste but--unless I had read the can--I am not sure I would be able to identify it as Kiwi-Berry.  It also has a slight aftertaste--not unpleasaant, but just there.  Also, I am not too sure I need the carbonation with fruit juice.  My 8 year old son on the other hand loved it.  He raved about the taste and the bubbles, claiming it tastes like Sprite only much better.  He seemed to like this and the other flavors about the same.  I would suggest this as something to try, but hesitate on buying more since the price is realtively high compared to other beverage options.

review/summary: Switch Kiwi Berry
review/text: The Switch Kiwi Berry is really good.  The taste is different.  It has a nice sour taste, and also is healthier than soda due to the low sugar content.

review/summary: Playing it Safe
review/text: I really enjoy trying new things, so I found the idea of this soda pleasing. It is essentially carbonated fruit juice, so it is naturally high in calories and thus comes in a small container that looks a lot like an energy drink. This might confuse some, leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be. However, I think a very valid complaint comes from some that feel this "natural" drink tastes a bit artificial. This is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate, which always have a more muddled flavor.  Having tried many of the Switch flavors, I find this one, like the watermelon, a bit plain and unexciting for a drink which purports to "switch" my world around.  The flavor really reminds me of strawberry-kiwi Snapple, which isn't a bad thing other than the lack of originality, and the carbonation is very pleasant.  It is an expensive treat, but would make a fun addition to breakfast in lieu of a similarly high calorie cup of orange juice.  If this is your first try at the Switch fruit sodas, I suggest trying the tangerine variety first, as it really better encapsulates the bright flavors of fresh fruit that I think the company is trying to achieve.

review/summary: Tastes like real kiwis and berries!  Yum!
review/text: Kiwi Berry is the fourth Switch flavor I've tried.  Only one of the flavors (tangerine) tasted like the fruit on the label; the others (Black Cherry and Watermelon-Strawberry) tasted like carbonated apple juice to me.  So, when I opened this, I wasn't quite sure what I'd get.  I'm happy to report that this tastes like fresh kiwis and berries.  It's sweet enough, without being too sweet, and it has plenty of carbonation.  This, along with the tangerine flavor, will be a favorite of mine.

review/summary: Taste pretty good...
review/text: This drink is a great alternative to soda. It has a little bit more sugar than soda but this has better ingredients than a regular soda can. It is a little pricey for a pack of 24 but it is better for you and it taste great.

review/summary: Delightful
review/text: I have tried a few of the different flavors of Switch now and I think this one is my favorite.  It has a nice smooth taste with a nice aftertaste of kiwi and strawberry.  As usual, the dominant first taste is apple and grape but the aftertaste comes on quickly.  It isn't too carbonated but not flat as well.  I think this is a great and refreshing drink.  I think it is so good you will wish the cans were bigger.

review/summary: It was a hit!
review/text: I'm not much of a juice drinker, but my daughter is so I bought this for her to try out.  I wasn't expecting much, so I was very happy when she announced that she really liked it!  It is essentially a carbonated fruit juice, but it is nice to have some different flavors for the kids.  So, it was a hit at our house and we'll definitely be buying more.

review/summary: Sweet drink
review/text: I was not overly impressed with this entry into the 'natural' soda sweepstakes. The flavor was OK, but it was achingly sweet. I enjoyed the small size, since it would be a better alternative to younger folks.<br /><br />But I would think twice because of the over-keening sweetnes.

review/summary: A Health Drink Can Do Better
review/text: "Switch" advertises itself as "100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't."  While the ingredient list certainly does confirm the particularly natural recipe required to create this beverage, I'm afraid I cannot endorse it very highly.  I have long been perturbed by drinks of this nature.  Someone aspiring to consume a more natural beverage with no preservatives or other unpronounceable additives should probably altogether avoid the canned, carbonated-beverage front.  Anyone genuinely interested in eating healthy, regardless of the contents of "Switch," probably wouldn't think twice about purchasing a drink such as this.  Instead, a can of this sort advertises to the hypocritical health nut, who has espoused notions of eating organically as a trend rather than as a genuine lifestyle change.<br /><br />The taste of the beverage itself is par for the course.  There is no added sugar, but it's still too sweet.  It's also more than a little too sour, and the fruity nature of it tastes a bit too much like cheap bubble gum.  I also cannot abide the half-hearted attempt at "carbonation" that this beverage and others like it undertake; it's carbonation that is a little too subtle to taste like anything more than the undercurrent of sour flavors.  Beverages that advertise themselves as "carbonated" should commit to the practice as well as the soda-pop industry has or else avoid the practice altogether; anyone truly interested in drinking healthy probably wouldn't be interested in a carbonated beverage anyway.<br /><br />In short, I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase "Switch."  I would drink it at need, when nothing else is available, but I find it to be a contradiction in form and marketing that clearly demonstrates the disingenuous motives of the company that produces it.
