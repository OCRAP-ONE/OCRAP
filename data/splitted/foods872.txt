review/summary: Don't buy..Not good, absolutely no flavor
review/text: This chicory/coffee is ver, very bland, with no flavor of either coffee or hickory.  I am very sorry that I bought it - in large quantity to save on shipping and I'm regretting it.  I wish I can return it, but, I don't want any one else with taste to suffer either.  I don't know what to do!Bottom line, we Americans don't know what true coffee/chicory is!

review/summary: Delicious But Lots of Calories
review/text: First off, these cookies taste amazing.  If you even remotely like peanut butter, then you'll love these cookies.  That being said, each cookie counts as TWO servings, not 1.  So before you jump up and say yay a cookie with 15 grams of protein, you have to multiply each of the nutritional values by two which means 426 calories and 60 grams of carbs PER cookie.  Basically, they're awesome for quick energy before a workout but not so much for losing weight.

review/summary: Yummy!!!
review/text: Finally a vegan cookie that has flavor options and have some good, nutritional stuff in them. We've tried all of the flavors of these and they are all delicious. Pumpkin is my personal favorite.  My daughter's favorite is the lemon poppy, my husband the peanut butter and my son the chocolate/chocolate chip. We just buy them all now. :) We are vegan and there is no sign of animal products that we can find. These need to be split in two, but we love to share in our house anyway. I sometimes split mine in two and eat 1/2 with my coffee and then half for dessert later. They have so much fiber and protein in them, I'm surprised at how good they are.

review/summary: Excellent conch meat
review/text: This conch meat arrived in excellent condition and was cleaner than when I was able to buy it at a local seafood store.  It's pricy but if you watch for sales on the Charleston Seafood website, sometimes they run specials.  I love to make my own conch chowder and make it for special occasions.  I will definitely purchase this again.

review/text: I have not personally purchaced conch meat from this supplier, however, I would defanantly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys seafood. I had conch twice while on a trip to Port-au-Prince, Haiti. It was the most delicious sea creature I've ever eaten! I had it fried, and scampied in a pasta and there isn't a scallop or lobster out there that could trump conch's succulent, moist, meaty goodness. In fact, ever since I had it I've wanted more, but I haven't had the chance. I would buy some of this, but I didn't realize how much it cost...

review/text: Received 2 boxes of Reg Timothy's and 2 boxes of Decaff. Packaging was excellent and delivered in just a few days. Amazon did a great job, but I must say the Decaff is a 5* but the regular is a 4* since it is a bit too strong. I can not blame that on Amazon, it's just a learning curve for K-cups for my Keurig coffee maker. Thanks Amazon. I'll be back. B

review/text: When I received my Keurig coffee maker with a variety pack of different coffees, I tried very hard to find my favorites because there were many I didn't like at all. Out of the assortment, I liked 3 and the Italian blend was one of them. However I couldn't find it in stores so eventually I ordered it from Amazon. Now that I have been drinking this blend for several weeks, it really isn't as good as I remembered. It's okay but I like the Kona and Nantuckett blends better.

review/text: The Italian Blend has a nice aroma and good flavor.  I brew it on the 10oz. size and it still has a nice little kick to it for a medium roast. I would say that it's comparable to the Timothy's Kona Blend, although it's a bit bolder and not as flavorful as the Kona. Still, a very nice cup of coffee.<br /><br />At this point, I think I've tried about 10 different types of K-Cups, and I think I'm liking Timothy's Kona and the Mocha Java the best.  However, the Italian Blend is a nice cup of coffee.

review/summary: OK, but there are better choices
review/text: I have been exploring the range of k-cups looking for my favorites. While the Timothy's Italian Roast isn't bad, there are better options.<br /><br />I like my coffee starbucks style: bold, strong, with lots of character. As a point of reference, my current faves are Coffee People Black Tiger, Tullys French Roast and Italian Roast, Emeril's French Roast, and Coffee People Sumatra and Dark Magic. I tried the Timothy's version of the Italian roast expecting a similar flavor to others I have tried in the bold varieties, and I found it to be on the weak side. It does have some of the nice smokey elements that you expect from an Italian roast... but Tullys does it better if you are looking for full flavor.<br /><br />If you prefer a medium bodied roast with some punch you will be happy with this, but it wasn't for me.

review/summary: From Flavorful Favorite to Weak Disappointment
review/text: I would have given this a 5-star review in the past but my last shipment (October 2010) was extremely weak and didn't taste anything like it used to.  The k-cups didn't seem to have very much coffee in them.  They seemed very light when shaken as compared with the past.  I would also like to note that I have noticed this same problem on quite a few of the k-cups.  Also, they all taste very similar and not a good taste.  I had read that Green Mountain may have taken over some of the k-cup business for Timothy's, Caribou, etc. and maybe they have changed something.  For now, I will buy from BBB when they have a coupon and I can check the freshness code on the package.<br /><br />But, really I have gone back to using a french press which really doesn't take that long to make and has superior flavor.

review/summary: Pleasantly smooth coffee....
review/text: When I purchased my Keurig coffeemaker I had no idea what coffee to buy.  Especially since there is such a huge selection of coffees to choose from. The saleslady suggested the Timothy's Italian Blend based on what kind and what flavor that I told her I liked. Plus, she really liked it, too. I'm from Louisiana and was a little hesitant to buy it.  Italian coffee.........for a southerner??  Well, I'm so glad I did! This is the smoothest, best tasting coffee I've ever had! No bitterness, just a great cup of coffee!! I even converted my husband over to it. He drank only one brand, one kind of coffee for a number of years. Now, he loves it and won't drink anything else!! I keep it on hand at all times. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: What's with Amazon's prices?
review/text: I last bought this in May 2011, for around $26.  I used to get it for around $17 on Subscribe and Save, before Amazon ended that option.  I had to stop buying all my k-cups from amazon, because the big warehouse club has an 80-pack of Donut House and Caribou blend varieties for $33.  I first thought it was just the coffee product that amazon was having pricing issues with, but their prices seem to be inflating across the board, while their competitors are not reflecting the same sort of steep increases.  I've found myself going to v*t*c*st.com for many of the repetitive grocery items that I used to order through amazon.  The main difference I can see is that amazon's competitors don't have to worry about pleasing Wall Street, so their prices are kept more honest.<br /><br />Italian Blend coffee is a decent mild coffee, my wife's favorite.  We'll keep ordering it, but it won't be from amazon.

review/text: I have had a Keurig for over a year and have tried many of the different k cups.  So far, this has been the best k-cup.  It isn't too strong and isn't too weak.  It holds its own against the half-n-half that I use with it and makes a consistently good cup of coffee.

review/text: This is my favorite k-cup coffee.  Believe me, I have tried them all.  I have purchased 4 Keurig machines in the last year, so you know I use a lot of k-cups.  I try the new ones when they come out, but I keep coming back to this one.  One cup at home, and one cup at work to start my day!<br /><br />Followup:<br />I have just got into the third box of the 4 in this order, and I am having blowouts with the k-cups.  Three in a row this morning.  I finially gave up and had another brand.  I hope this doesn't continue.  I may have to find another favorite!!

review/summary: My new favorite!
review/text: Have only had the Keurig for about 2 months.  The Timothy's Italian blend was in one of the sample packs.  One cup, and I was hooked.  Usually bold & extra bold are deliciously strong but also have a bite to them that ruins the taste of the coffee for me.  It tastes like the brewed coffee was burned.  The Italian blend has the perfect combo of strength & fullness, without the bite.  It is sooo smooth.  I know that everyone has their own taste in coffee, but to my mind this is "kewl beans" (don't know what that means, but heard it somewhere and it sounds right, lol)  Absolutely delicious.

review/text: Timothy's Italian Roast is a very good medium roast coffee.  I found little bitterness or aftertaste with it.  A nice smooth cup of coffee.  So many choices in the k-cup world. There's something for everyone. I would give it 5 stars but the name says Italian Blend.  I would figure an Italian coffee would have a darker roast.

review/summary: OK Medium Blend Coffee. Slightly Bitter.
review/text: Timothy's Italian Blend is a standard Medium roast coffee - nothing remarkable in my opinion.  I found it to have a hint of bitterness, which is also a negative for me.<br /><br />I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL512">Tully's Coffee Italian Roast for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> because Tully's seems to have a little more flavor, but is also a touch bolder.<br /><br />If you are a medium to light blend coffee drinker, then you may find this blend pleasing; however, if you lean to medium bold blends, then you should look elsewhere.

review/text: Tastes like coffee!  Not burnt, not bitter, just good coffee.<br /><br />Only gave it 4 stars because of "blow-outs".  Unfortunately, with this brand, I get about 1 blow-out per 30-35 k-kups.  I have never experienced this amount of blow-outs with other brands (in fact, only a single one in about 500).  I would recommend gently squeezing before inserting in to brewer to verify a tight seal on the top.

review/summary: Tasty coffee, attractive Subscribe&Save price
review/text: We tried several different varieties of Timothy's and other K-Cup providers (Green Mountain comes to mind, but I know there were others also) and found the Italian Blend by Timothy's to be an all-around very drinkable blend, and as a result also practical to order through subscribe&save.  When using multiple blends it was not practical to manage each subscription because of lower volume, but having been able to settle on one favorite the additional subscribe and save discount, and the ease of managing just one subscription makes this a winner.  Also, it is admittedly a fairly small sample size but the number of cups that are duds (i.e. when brewing either grounds end up in the mug, or the mug does not brew completely) has been much smaller with the italian blend than with other Timothy's or other manufacturers products.

Amazon needs to get it back in stock and get the price back down into the realm of sanity!<br /><br />I love the smell and taste of Starbucks Espresso Roast in the latte's we make at home and work, which is why I decided to try the Italian blend, and it is by far my favorite.  It smells like a good morning cup should smell, then tastes just as good.  Most of the others have too much coffee in the k-cup for me and come on much too strong.  This one makes a perfect large cup of coffee.  I still buy others because my husband likes to explore but, in the morning, this is my coffee.

review/summary: A very good cup of coffee
review/text: I have tried several of the Timothy's coffee's as part of the initial variety pack which came with the Keurig brewer.  I tend to use the 10oz brew and add a bit of creamer or flavored creamer to my cup of coffee, but I always try to taste the coffee itself before doctoring it to my taste.  This was a very good cup, I prefer a medium to dark coffee, and usually drink a moderately strong french roast at work.  This was the best of the non flavored coffees, Timothy's or otherwise which I have tried so far (coffee people french roast is a 3 star, Newman's extra Bold and Timothy's Nicaragua extra bold are both very good but a little strong for my taste)  If you like a medium coffee that is smooth and flavors nicely with a creamer give this one a try.

If typical breakfast blends and the like are just too weak for you and the super-double dark ones are too bitter, give these a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />For a "taste preference" reference point, I am also a big fan of Kona and Kona blends.

review/summary: Pine nuts! The best.
review/text: This is far and away the best bottled pesto I've tried, and I've tried quite a few. Alessi is one of the last manufacturers to continue using the traditional but now very expensive pine nuts, which I believe is essential for a great pesto sauce. Many of the other manufacturers have switched to cashew nuts or walnuts in recent years, much to their detriment. I buy these by the dozen.

review/summary: Best Pesto available on Amazon
review/text: Despite the presence of preservative, this Italian Pesto is, without a doubt, my favorite pesto. My family and I eat it on capelli d'angeli at least once every week. Delicious beyond compare.<br /><br />This brand of Pesto is one of the few I recently tried and it is my favorite. So many times, Pesto  can be too oily, covering up the taste of the basil and the pine nuts. Not so with this pesto. Every ingredient seems to be perfectly balanced so you get the freshest, most flavorful Pesto available. The taste of the basil and the pine nuts is delicate, but so exquisite.<br /><br />If you like Pesto or just want a change from more "traditional" tomato sauces, I urge you to give this pesto a try. You will love it<br /><br />Shipped and sold from Amazon for: 29.99!

review/summary: Packs a punch!
review/text: D&G is the spiciest ginger beer I've ever had. The burn is pretty addictive -- once you get used to it. It's definitely strong enough to stand up to ice and Gosling's dark rum in a dark-n-stormy cocktail or in a Moscow mule without losing its oomph.<br /><br />Be warned however: on its own, it packs a serious ginger punch. The first time I sipped it, that ginger tingle caught me completely off-guard and I sneezed. Delicious though. Every Jamaican American I know drinks it.

review/summary: Authentic West Indian/Carribean Spice
review/text: I'm from Dorchester, MA...a section a Boston Inhabited by a large percentage of Carribean and Latin immigrants. When I was 5 years old, the Trinidadian lady next door told my mom this would cure me of my chicken pox. (and by the way, THIS IS NON-alcoholic) I remember it being a little spicier back then but that could have been because I had 5 year old taste buds that hadn't been tarnished by years of spicy food. But anyway, they haven't changed the label all this time (20 years) and this goes fantastic with Indian, Tex Mex and West Indian foods known for their spice. It does not take away from any other food, nor does spicy food diminish its uncompromising taste. Now the con is that if you're counting calories, this is NOT a lower-fat or necessarily a healthy alternative to alcoholic beer, this has 226 calories per bottle. I do think that alcoholic drinkers can appreciate its "kick", however. I actually have cut down on beer because i've been enjoying this so much. Shipping is very costly but its incredibly worth it- I now live in South Carolina where there is no Carribean immigration whatsoever, so its a taste of diversity.

review/text: My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine.

review/summary: Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound
review/text: I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.

review/summary: Feed my two dogs only Wellness brand. Consistently on top ten canned dog food lists
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and otehr healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: This is the ONLY food my dog will eat
review/text: I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.

review/text: My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.

review/text: I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.
