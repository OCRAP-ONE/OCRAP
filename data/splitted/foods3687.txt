review/summary: Pizza Seasoning
review/text: Our family loves the Magic Seasoning Blends, but particularly the Herbal Pizza and Pasta blend. Unfortunately, you can no longer find this blend in stores and I was thrilled to find it here. It adds a little "extra" flavor to many dishes other than pizza.

review/summary: More Magic
review/text: Our local grocer use to carry this seasoning blend.  We were hooked quickly.  Fabulous on pizza; add to either homemade or frozen before baking.  Good on just about anything else.  Some of my favorite non-pizza uses are sprinkled on pasta, on the inside of grilled cheese, and on mixed veggies.<br /><br />We really didn't need 6 bottles, so we gave a few to friends.  They love it just as much as we do.  Their favorite uses are on salad (instead of dressing) and on salmon.

review/summary: At last -- a distinctive low-sodium seasoning.
review/text: Those of us who must limit sodium intake tend to be desperate for palatable low-sodium seasonings and grateful when we find them. BaconSalt has leapt way beyond merely "palatable," however, and brought new seasoning products to market that can make salt-hungry, bacon-deprived deprived folk like us absolutely giggle with delight. When we first learned about BaconSalt, we bought one of each flavor (the basics on Amazon, some special ones on the company website), plus extras for gifts. We sent a half-price gift package to loved ones at an APO address (as of this writing, the company actually gives military buyers/recipients a 50% discount -- imagine that!). We have no interest in the company, BTW ... we're just happy consumers grateful to find that we needn't abandon the savory flavors of bacon in the pursuit of good health.

review/summary: This Little Piggy...
review/text: I had never heard of Bacon Salt until I found it by accident, online.  I bought three bottles of it from Amazon, and I am NOT disappointed.  This salt is PERFECT on a BLT sandwich, sprinkled over fat free popcorn, in an omelet, etc.  It has a true bacon flavor with no calories.  This company (J&D's) also makes a product called Baconnaise, which is basically a bacon flavored mayonnaise-tasting sauce that has very little calories in a 2 Tablespoon serving.  The Baconnaise is also fabulous!  They have their own website....just look up J&D's on Google.  I would highly recommend the bacon salt and also the Baconnaise...

review/summary: Blown away!
review/text: I have 3 different flavors on these and they are : jalape&ntilde;o , apple wood ,a and hickory. I so far think hickory has the best smoke taste but apple wood has more bacon flavor. Jalape&ntilde;o is good but not the best . All these products do and will add complex flavor to your food. They add great smoke and subtle bacon flavor. You can smell the bacon and taste it on most foods. I think it is the best on chicken. I disagree with the people that say there is hardly any bacon flavor and I think you guys have poor palates. Do not expect this to make your food taste like it was wrapped by 90 pieces of bacon for Pete's sake! No seasoning is meant to achieve this level of flavor and if you want full bacon taste then buy bacon and eat it! But JD's bacon products are amazing and my wife and I love it on most BBQ meats and I like to add it to chili's and anything you wish to add extra flavor to. Highly recomended and it will always be in my spice cupboard .

review/summary: Best Spice EVER!
review/text: Ever needed a spice that could set your meals apart from the rest?  J&D's Hickory Bacon Salt is my secret weapon!  Use it to liven up mashed potatoes, sprinkle it on your burgers for pro burger status with your friends.  Use it as a dry rub on Chicken and grill the chicken in a foil pack with potatoes for a meal that'll drop the jaws, and earn the respect of your most challenging food critic, if they still don't like it, punch them in the mouth because they're lying!  Use it on your eggs for that bacon flavor right in the egg!  This has been by far my favorite spice of all time, about the only thing I don't use it on are steaks, for which I prefer Montreal Steak Seasoning for, but for everything from eggs to chicken to fish to potatoes to broccoli and more, J&D's Bacon Salt is my choice!

review/summary: A little smoke flavor is all I get
review/text: I tried the Hickory smoked bacon flavor salt to see if it was better than their standard bacon salt.<br /><br />I love bacon. I like it well done and crispy. I often add the fake bacon bits to salads or pasta. The flavor is okay, bacon like but not as good as the real thing. I have started using the packaged crumpled bacon by Plumrose, or Oscar-myer. That gives a very nice real bacon flavor to anything you put it on.<br /><br />So when I received the package, I couldn't wait to open it and try it on some food. What a disappointment ! It tastes like salt and MSG with a slight smoky yeast flavoring... not close to a nice bacon experience. I tried it on a sandwich, veggies, etc.... still a far cry from a nice bacon taste. Just salt, MSG and a little smoke flavor ...<br /><br />I can't see myself buying any more of this,it just doesn't perform, and it is not cheap...

review/summary: Best tacos I've ever had
review/text: I love these packets. They're amazingly easy to use. I usually buy 1.25 lbs or somewhere near there of hamburger meat (I prefer lean 93/7, but the 80/20 is probably OK), and I use two of these taco packets. I really love these things. I think that I'm usually able to find them cheaper in the grocery store than the prices listed here. You may want to try one packet in the meat, let it cook, taste it, and then add the other packet if you think it needs it. There's also the mild version and a spicy version that you may like more than this. I'm not the type of person to like terribly spicy food.<br /><br />From their website (as I just threw out the packets I used today for my tacos):<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />SPICES (INCLUDING CHILI PEPPER, CUMIN, PAPRIKA, OREGANO), ONION, WHEY (MILK), SALT, SUGAR, GARLIC, POTATO STARCH, AND CITRIC ACID.<br /><br />Serving Size:<br />2 tsp. mix (6g) (Seasons 2 tacos)<br />Servings per Container: about 6.<br /><br />Available Size:<br />1.25 ounces, UPC 5210009170<br /><br />Nutrient Information:<br />Calories:20 Fat:0 g Cholesterol: 0 mg Protein: Less than 1 g Sodium: 420 mg Carbohydrates: 4 g<br /><br />Sugar: 1g<br />Fiber: 0 g<br /><br />I think they've changed the image on the taco packets. I haven't tried the ones with the new image, and I can't comment as to whether or not there is a difference in flavor. As far as I can tell, there shouldn't be a difference in flavor. If they're too expensive, Walmart started making Great Value packets that are cheaper and comparable in taste. I also love the Thick and Zesty Spaghetti Mix that they make. I haven't tried others, but they may be worth it. I'd really only buy these on sale, though.

review/summary: Worth the money
review/text: I always wanted to try out this product, but Amazon only sells these in bulk. I got my chance to sample this product at Stop and Shop, where I bought a single package for $1.50. Obviously, it's slightly pricy.<br /><br />The preparation is extremely easy. All you need to do is measure out the appropriate amount of milk and mix it with the appropriate amount of mix until there aren't any lumps, then refrigerate it for a few minutes. I did mine for 10, although the package says 5. I must warn you, however, that you must use milk containing lactose. I did an experiment, with one half package with soy milk, and the other half with 1% milk. The soy milk was nowhere near as thick and creamy.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, this pudding is AWESOME. Per 1/2 cup prepared, there is an estimated 140 calories, 3 grams of fiber, 15% of your day's worth of calcium, and 7 grams of protein. I'd say it's great for people on diets: good portion size, moderate amount of calories, very satisfying (protein and fiber), and quick to prepare.<br /><br />If you haven't caught up yet, the texture is very creamy and thick, and the taste is very rich and chocolately. There are no chemical aftertastes, simply because there aren't any SYNTHESIZED ingredients. Not too sweet, and not disgustingly bitter either. It's perfect, and you should try it. Holy yumtown.

review/summary: 3.5* snack for a non-chocophile
review/text: It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!

review/summary: The portable and edible Oreo
review/text: One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!

review/summary: Flavor in, Calories Down, Fat Nearly Out
review/text: As I get older and fatter, I seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy.  Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.<br /><br />Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.<br /><br />You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.<br /><br />Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.<br /><br />Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Now we have the Oreo transformed into a baked chocolate wafer snack
review/text: We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the "Oreo Biscuit").  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the "modern" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for "hill"), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the "cream" in between.<br /><br />Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br /><br />But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br />These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: "Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.

review/summary: THESE ARE TRUE 'MAINSTREAM' DIET SNACKS --
review/text: FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES<br /><br />When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, "100 calorie packs" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + "ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS" & "ARTIFICIAL COLORS" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history.

review/summary: Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?
review/text: I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of "A Star Is Born" the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are "100 Calorie Packs", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.

The texture is perfection. If you feel like chewing them quickly or take it slowly and let the light wafer melt in your mouth.

review/summary: They're not bad
review/text: Let me begin by saying that I do not like Oreo cookies at all. I think the cookie part is bitter and I hate the white cream filling. When a friend suggested I try these I was reluctant and kept telling her that I was not interested. She insisted so I tried a few and surprisingly did not find them to be bad at all. I'm diabetic, so this is not a snack I will be eating often, but a few here and there won't hurt. If you're expecting these to taste like Oreo cookies (I'm one who's glad they didn't!!), then you'll be disappointed. But if you want a chocolate snack that's low in calories and fat please give these a try.

review/text: Growing up on Oreos and milk is common. So I was taken aback with the brand extension of Oreo's to cakesters. And while I had low expectations, I must say these are better than normal Oreos. Although I can't say it'll beat the combo of oreos and milk, these are fantastic treats and relatively guilt-free.  If you like cake and like Oreos you can't go wrong with Oreo cakesters.<br /><br />The filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new Oreo experience. Certainly worth a try - guaranteed enjoyment!

review/text: I loved the original Oreo Cakesters when they first debuted. But, I shied away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving. So, when I saw the commercial for the 100 calorie version, I could hardly wait to try them, and I must say I am very impressed!<br /><br />While some of the 100 calorie snack cakes can have a dry, mealy consistency, these cakes are moist, decadent and taste 100% like the originals.....just smaller. I would recommend them to anyone who liked the original version, but is watching calories. Good job Nabisco!

review/text: These are great snacks for traveling, such as, by airplane or car.  The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker.  The cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble; and for this reason a preferred treat.<br /><br />The texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat.  The first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is, "Humm these are good!"  This is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time.

review/text: Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre.

review/summary: Delicious Mini Chocolate Treats Help Weight Loss Efforts!
review/text: I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.<br /><br />The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.<br /><br />The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.<br /><br />My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!<br /><br />My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.<br /><br />I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!<br /><br />I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.<br /><br />If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.<br /><br />I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you.

review/text: As my husband weans off of his caffeinated tea, he has migrated over to mint tea. We both find it a refreshing pick-me-up in the mornings without the caffeine jolt (and consequent crash).<br /><br />I gave it four stars because it is excellent, but in my opinion, not the best for this type of tea. I highly recommend Good Earth teas overall. Thus far, they haven't let me down. This one has a cool mint flavor that tastes very fresh and enlivening. I haven't tried it yet in hot cocoa, but I think it would be excellent. I have tried several brands of mint tea, and this one ranks second on our list. First is the Tazo tea "Refresh" (the only Starbucks tea we give the thumbs up to). Refresh has a slightly better mint combination and is more potent (more rich tea per cup) - but really, it is a close call, this one is excellent too.

You might, because they are pretty chewy, as classic licorice should be.<br /><br />The bags are tough and very well sealed. You'll want scissors to get them open.<br /><br />The only problem is that there's just not much licorice here. The total is only a bit over twenty ounces. So you're basically paying the price of high quality chocolate for licorice. Even though I liked them, I can't cost-justify them, and I won't be buying again.

review/text: These seedless raspberry preserves by Polaner are delicious! They are easy to spread onto bread, toast, crackers, etc. and the taste is out of this world! In addition, there is no sugar and Polaner packs in the fiber which is good for my diet. They stay fresh for quite a while after you open the jar; I suggest that you refrigerate these after opening the jar.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys raspberry preserves.

My cat usually don't like pate cat food but this one is devoured quickly. There is another New Zealand based pet food manufacturer that offers venison cat food and my cats eat it but they aren't as crazy over it as with Addiction's New Zealand Venison & Apple Entree. The new entrees from Addiction aren't that well received by my cats either.<br /><br />SO PLEASE DON'T DISCONTINUE THIS ONE!!!

review/summary: Aromatic Organics Salmon and Fish seasoning
review/text: For a number of years I have been using Aromatic Organic Great King Salmon seasoning and rub. After our local Albertsons super market went under, we lost our supplier. We were able to find a can or two on a trip to Tn at Kroegers, but they never seemed to stock this flavor.Trying to purchase direct from Aromatic was not possible as they only want to deal wholesale. After my wife went searching on Amazon, we found this Aromatic product "Salmon and Fish" seasoning. This is close , if not the same as the Great King Salmon seasoning and we are happy to find it as a add on product on Amazon. I think we got the last can. As you might figure we love this stuff on fresh Sockeye or Atlantic grilled salmon filets. If you can find it, buy it. MMMMMMMM GOOD

review/text: Until my wife and I started a weight loss effort earlier this summer, we hadn't eaten all that much Progresso soup. Because of their variety of flavors and low calories, we decided to give them a try, and I'm very glad we did.<br /><br />This soup is only 60 calories per serving, but has great flavor, as do all the Progresso soups we've tried. Many lo-cal soups are just blah tasting, but Progresso puts a nice blend of spices into everything we've tried, and this soup is no exception. I'm quite impressed and heartily recommend this variety to dieters who'd like a low calorie meal that they can enjoy the taste of!

I have tried numerous<br />products to try to get rid of this infection.  Some products would help but would not<br />completely take care of it.  If the infection clears up I won't have to have a crown<br />put in one of my teeth. Needless to say I feel like I have found a miracle product for<br />my problem!

review/summary: One of the better xylitol gums
review/text: Like the spearmint flavor.  Most the flavor is gone after a few minutes, but it's still decent to chew on for up to an hour.  I need at least 2 pieces, as the majority of the gum is xylitol and dissolves like sugar.  After that it still retains a decent minty taste that is better than the other purely xylitol gums I've tried.  As a side note, I haven't had a cavity in the few years since I switched to xylitol gum and toothpaste.<br /><br />This gum doesn't last long, but it gets the job done of keeping teeth healthy after some food or drink... so I just discard it after 5-15 minutes.<br /><br />Somehow they need to figure out how to make the flavor release slower.<br /><br />edit:  Now I like cinnamon Solar Energy Gum by B-Fresh equally as well.

review/text: I bought these cookies because I had heard they were like the Lemon Coolers that Sunshine Cookies used to make a few years ago.  Sunshine Cookies was bought out by Nabisco, and several recipes didn't make the cut.  I was very dissappointed in these cookies, not because they weren't good, but because they're nowhere near as good as the originals. The lemon flavor is pretty weak, so it's mostly a powdered sugar cookie.

The disgusting part is that I didn't see the bugs until I had already eaten some of them :-( I urge you to inspect closely before eating or stay away completely like I will now.

review/text: These are the best! I used to buy them at the Dollar General until they were replaced by a cheap imposter. I saw them at Walmart last Sunday and was so happy to have found them again. I bought several boxes. They are delicious. These are my new favorite.<br /> Thank You Niche Foods for such a great product.

review/text: These Cookies Is Good. They are not exactly like the old Lemon Coolers that had the awesome balls of lemon bursts through out the cookie. And dont quite have that lemon bite and tartness that the originals had, but these cookies are kind of like eating lemon cake, or lemon pudding, but in the form of a cookie. They are good and as close as I can find to the good ole original.

review/summary: Not so cool
review/text: I love lemon cookies. These, I did not love. They were not crisp, bordering on stale. Also, the powdered sugar coating was too sweet with only a trace of lemon flavor. I am very disappointed with this product. I will stick with the superior Pepperidge Farm Snowball Citrus cookies. Those are everything that the lemon coolers aren't.

review/text: I was looking for the Sunshine brand "Lemon Cooler" cookies I used to buy. Couldn't find those so I got these instead. These are terrible. I'm guessing the people that like them never tasted the Sunshine Lemon Coolers. The Lemon Coolers tasted like a flavored Nilla wafer with lemon flavored powdered sugar on it... big YUM! The texture of these cookies is weird... big, hard crumbs. It has a weird lemon taste, not tart just strong (probably artificial), and the powdered sugar has no lemon taste at all. Have since found out that Sunshine was bought out by Keebler and they discontinued the Lemon Cooler cookies. I found a promising recipe on the internet that I'll try. Wont be buying these again. Yuck!

review/summary: Good but not zingy
review/text: I had pregnancy cravings for the Sunshine lemon coolers that are no longer available, so I happily bought these from Amazon (I didn't realize there was a similar product out there until doing a search).  They arrived shrink wrapped together in a box full of air bubble packs.<br /><br />They are very similar to the Sunshine lemon coolers, without the tangy zing that the coolers had.  They have a similar cookie (though the consistency is slightly different, a little crunchier/less smooth) and similar powder coating.  In the absence of the original, they REALLY hit the spot though.  If I'd never had the Sunshine lemon coolers, I'd still really enjoy this cookie.<br /><br />These are fabulous with a cup of tea and paired that way seem a little more posh than your typical cookie.

review/summary: Yummy in the tummy
review/text: I'm so glad that we've discovered this treat on Amazon.com!<br /><br />Very reasonably priced for a 6 pac.<br /><br />Quite tasty, and reminiscent of times gone by...it seems that so many companies<br />that made this food product in the past have bowed out of the market.  Lemony<br />snacks are so refreshing, especially with the powdered effect on the outside. My<br />only 'complaint' is that it doesn't have the tarty taste we so appreciated in the past.<br /><br />Two thumbs up...will definitely raid this cookie jar again and again.....

review/summary: NOT the old Lemon Coolers
review/text: I bought one box of these, thinking they would be a lot like the old Sunshine Lemon Coolers cookies.  They are DEFINITELY not them.  No tangy lemon flavor in the powdered sugar.  Though the box says, "COOLER THAN EVER!", they don't have that cool sensation like the originals had.<br /><br />The smell is the same, the look is the same, the texture is the same...but the taste doesn't measure up at all, if you're looking for a substitute for Lemon Coolers. :(

review/summary: Just ok
review/text: Got these thinking they would be like to old lemon coolers. These have a slight lemon taste but that is it. There was hardly any powdered sugar on mine and they lacked even one drop of tartness. I would not call them crisp lemon cookies(as they do on the box) very misleading. They are not filling my void of the old lemon coolers. Please bring back the old ones!
