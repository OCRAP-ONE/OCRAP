review/summary: Bad! Bad! Shipping
review/text: I bought this because I wanted to use it in my emergency food rotation and I have not found it in my local area. I am sure I could train a chimp to ship this product w/ more care. Out of the 24 cans, only 8 are usable. It appears to me, whoever shipped this product, dropped it, was to lazy to pick it up, kicked it to the spot where the shipping box was, picked it up and said hey Frank catch, Frank missed so he ran over it w/ a forklift, the janitor then picked it up and said, this should not be left on the floor and set it in the shipping box, but the janitor didn't know where to find shipping tape, so he put it on the delivery truck as is, completely opened. Wow that was a long poorly constructed sentance, only to say from now on I'll stick to local grocery stores.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: I have been using these pill pockets for a couple of years.  I have two dogs who are in congestive heart failure, one who will eat anything and one who will eat nearly nothing and certainly nothing out of my hand except for cheese or meat!  For the one who will eat anything, these are a God send.  I put her pills in the pill pocket and she gobbles them up.  For the other dog, I have to load the pill pocket and then poke it down his throat.  However, the nice thing is that he don't taste the pills, some of which are real nasty tasting, which makes giving him pills much easier.  My dogs prefer the chicken and it is somewhat softer than the beef.  Neither of them likes the turkey.<br /><br />One can use cheese, hotdogs, liverwurst, but the pill pockets are much easier and less messier and definitely easier to poke down a resistant doggy!  These pill pockets are a great invention and much less expensive through Amazon than from the vet or a pet store!

review/text: Royal Canin Feline Health Nutrition Indoor Intense Hairball 34 worked as well as some, and much better than many cat foods we have tried for this purpose. My cats seemed to like the flavor, and we had no problems while using the product. The only drawback for us is the higher cost; we cannot always afford it, as we are feeding 3 cats. I think we will use in the future whenever we are able!!!!

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This is the best coating for veal, pork and chicken I have ever found. It's quick to fix - just dip dampended cutlets into the mix until it adheres on both sides. I usually let them sit for about 1/2 hour before putting them into the pan. I do not use oil (like suggested on the package) but a spray like Pam, adding a few sprays as needed when I turn them. Never cook on hot burner but medium to low. They come out crisp and lightly browned and are absolutely delicious with a little lemon sprinkled over them. My family loves them every time I serve them. It's the only coating I have used for years. I just hope Amazon will have them back in stock soon as they are the cheapest place I have found them so far. Specialty and import stores usually charge very high postage.

review/summary: Good European biscuit
review/text: Balhsen is a German food company mainly producing biscuits, cookies, cakes, and breads. As far as the Hit variety of cookies, there are several different versions with some containing chocolate cream and others a vanilla cream. Regardless of what version you select, these are excellent cookies for the price. The cookie itself is big but it very light in texture compared to an oatmeal cookie. The wafers have an excellent chocolate flavor and the vanilla cream is very light and tasty. Please note that although the company itself is headquartered in Germany these cookies are produced in Poland but having tasted both the versions from Germany and Poland, there is no difference in the quality and taste. Great with a tall glass of cold milk or your favorite coffee or tea.

review/text: When I bought this, I only knew that I liked dates and figured I'd take a chance and see what this jam was about, because I had never seen it elsewhere.  After it arrived, I tried just a little on a spoon and I was blown away!  It tastes like you're eating pure goodness.  I then tried it on my bagel with cream cheese and it was a great combination, and then I had it with crackers and Gouda cheese and the jam was as good or better than any other jam I've ever had.  I wish I could buy this stuff by the bucket, because the gourmet jar leaves the consumer wishing there was more.  I guess until they start putting this stuff in bigger jars I'll just have to buy multiples of the 4oz.

review/text: I tend to try a lot of jerky-type snacks and this product is a treat for sure! It was my first taste of these Jim Beam snack products, so I didn't know what to expect - but the texture and taste really stood out right from the start. The "glaze" is probably what makes this so decadent, it almost feels greasy to the touch -  but the taste is just so addictive. I usually end up eating the whole bag at once, so buying this 3-pack is definitely the way to go.

review/text: This isn't the best jerky I've had, but it is far from bad and not as expensive as some. It is tender and has a beefy flavor that most jerky I've had lacks, which is a plus. The glaze isn't overpowering like some I've had, but it is greasy. The price is good especially since decent jerky costs at least $5 for a small bag at my local stores and I got these 4 for a about $16.<br /><br />Most likely going to end up buying more to snack on if I can keep getting it at that price.<br /><br />***Update***<br /><br />In one of the bags the contents were moldy and smelled awful(Best by date was 9/14/12). I marked the review down to 2 stars from 4 because while the product is good taking a bite of rotting meat in the dark as a late night snack sort of ruined this product for me.

review/summary: BEST Organic Dog Food Ever!
review/text: If you're on the fence about whether to try this food out for your dog or not, please do both of you a favor and get this food!  This is by far, the BEST dog food I have come across and I have been telling everyone who cares about their dog(s) to get this food for their own dogs.<br /><br />For years, my dog had been having issues with dog food in general, and was diagnosed as having a 'sensitive stomach' which is when I began my quest into dog food research.  Added to this was the dog food recall scare from a couple years ago and I started looking into healthier alternatives for dog food.  First and foremost, I found that about 90 percent of dog food that had been drilled into our heads as being 'good' and 'healthy' for my dog was in fact the exact opposite. Bad food filled with bad things and bad by-products and fillers.  In other words, I had been feeding my poor dog 'junk food' for years and I felt horrible once I discovered the truth about dog food.<br /><br />My dog had been having issues with soft stools, etc. and was not doing well. After several expensive visits to the vet to rule out any serious medical conditions (which they were not going to rule out unless I spent more $$ on more tests to determine this), I decided to start with the food.  I did a ton of research online and came upon this food and decided to give it a try.  I was looking specifically for Organic, Healthy Food made 100 percent in the USA so I would not have to worry about miscellaneous ingredients making their way into my dogs' food (like with the big brand names), which is when I came across Organix Dog Food. Not only did they fit all of my requirements, they went a step further with the Fiber Content in their food.  I learned that most other dog foods had a fiber content of between 1-3 percent making them very low in fiber.  Then I discovered that to be healthy for dogs, they needed a fiber content of 5 percent or higher, which I found out this food had!  Score!<br /><br />I bought this food with all of this in mind and my dog and I have not been disappointed. My dog now loves to eat his Organix dog food, he now has NORMAL stools and he no longer has to go in to the vet for more expensive medical tests.  I can honestly say, this food has been the BEST for him and I am very grateful to have found it.  If your dogs are having similar problems, please give this food a try and I bet you too will be pleasantly surprised.  Thing is, when you switch ANY dogs' food, you have to do so gradually, over about a week or so with their old dog food and the new food until you fully switch them over to the new food.  That said, expect good results at the end of that transition, once they are 100 percent transferred onto this new food.<br /><br />The main reason I wanted to leave this review on here was to help other dog owners out there who are looking for healthier alternatives to their dogs' current food, so their dogs can live healthier, happier lives as well.  Best of luck to you and your dog(s)!

review/text: Before this, I'd buy my 11 year old dachshund Purina or other food from the local grocery store.  She was experiencing some hair loss and a few other minor problems, so I decided to switch her food to Organix.  My husband and I did extensive research and found that Organix seemed to be the best product for her, and the weight management aspect was a definite plus for us.  Of course, she loves this just as she loves any other food, but we have noticed a big improvement with her "regularity" and digestion, as well as her shiny coat and added energy.  I absolutely love this pet food and will definitely stand by this product - you are what you eat, and especially at my dog's age, I want her to be as healthy as possible.

review/text: We discovered the difference in the quality dog foods when I started searching for a new food because of repeated ear infections.  We recently switched to Organix after the Innova plant was bought out.  I tried several other foods but this is the best.  My dog loves it, her coat is shiny and thick.  She has had no problems switching to it.  She is spoiled, and has to have a small amount of human food mixed in her dry.  I can take a tablespoon of Organix canned and mix it with this and she eats the whole bowl.  In the past she would turn her nose up at any canned mix-in.  I highly recommend this food and I highly recommend Amazon for the best price.

review/summary: This is a big bag of HORRIBLE coffee!
review/text: OK, others have raved about how great this coffee is, which is why I sprung for a whole 5 pounds.  To begin with, the packaging for the coffee was not intact when it arrived.  The outer plastic bag had a hole torn in the bottom and the product package was ripped at its side seam, so coffee beans were scattered through the shipping box.  Just a visual inspection of the dark beans with a glint of oil sheen told me that this was certainly NOT light roast (why can't the coffee delivered match the coffee ordered?).  I went ahead and ground a batch of beans and made a pot of coffee using the same technique we use for our usual coffee (Allegro Organic varieties, which I promise are fantastic).  Even before the first sip, I knew there was a problem - the stuff smelled a little bit like a wet dog.  This off-putting aroma was a warning that I should have heeded, as the first sip was incredibly flat except for a stale cardboard-like taste.  In desperation, I added a bit of cream even though we always have our usual (excellent Allegro Organics) coffee black.  That desperate move was just an insult to the cream.  The coffee in the mug and the entire pot went down the sink.  Oh, and the icing here is that this item cannot be returned.<br />So, what went wrong with this very large bag of coffee?  Even though I ordered a light roast and was provided a dark roast, there must have been some problems with the storage of this particular bag.  I cannot imagine such a flat, stale flavor from any proper coffee bean grown on the planet, so this bag must have seen a few years in a warehouse without climate control.  The compromised packaging certainly could not have helped.  My advice to you would be to look for a different coffee item - unfortunately, Amazon is not selling the Allegro Organics.

review/text: ****<br /><br />Tazo Assorted Black and Green Teas and Herbal Infusions includes one or two of each:<br /><br />AWAKE:  plain ordinary black tea, a little bitter<br /><br />CALM:  nice chamomile tea<br /><br />CHAI BLACK TEA:  an okay chai black tea with caffeine<br /><br />CHINA GREEN TIPS:  great green tea experience, Tazo's best, no "natural flavorings"<br /><br />DECAFFEINATED CHAI: an okay chai black tea without caffeine<br /><br />EARL GREY BLACK TEA:  a disappointing perfumy, intense, black tea experience<br /><br />LOTUS:  decaf green tea with lotus flower, one of my favorite Tazo's<br /><br />PASSION HERBAL INFUSION:  hibiscus-y, intense, caffeine-free, and luxurious<br /><br />WILD SWEET ORANGE:  orange herbal tea, some complex overtones perhaps<br /><br />ZEN:  mild, relaxed green tea<br /><br />Their ingredients include: black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, citric acid, natural flavors, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, rooibos, ginger root, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflower, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise, and red poppy flowers.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only "real" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for.<br /><br />****

review/summary: Great for senior kitties!
review/text: My 14-15 year old cat was wearing down, had a bout of pancreatitis, started limping, was on antibiotics twice in recent months, his coat was starting to shed terribly and he was vomiting a lot. I was starting to think that was it for our sweet cat. I don't know what made me switch him to this food but he went through the first bag in a month and now, he's like a much younger cat. His coat is beautiful and shiny, his eyes look bright again and no vomiting. Even the limp is just about gone. You would swear he was half his age! I'm definitely sticking with this and thanking each day we have with our cat.

review/summary: Great Quality Food!
review/text: My cat loves it. I was feeding her Science Diet, but when her hairballs became more frequent, I decided it was time for something more natural. I picked up BG, and she took to it right away. She's usually a very picky eater. Her coat is shiny and thick, and she seems happier than she used to be. She has more energy, is more social, and overall looks much healthier. She's always been a thin cat, but with the way her fur has filled out, she looks better. The food has lasted a long time, too. I bought it months ago, and I'm only barely started to run low. I leave her food out for her to eat whenver she wants, so it must be more satisfying in smaller amounts compared to cheaper food.<br /><br />Update: I cannot keep my roommate's cats away from this food! My roommate feeds her cats Wellness, which is another good quality grain-free food, but her cats CONSTANTLY try to sneak their way into my bedroom to eat my cat's food. It's getting ridiculous. This stuff must taste good!

review/summary: If you love your pet, feed them Before Grain
review/text: After watching the documentary "Food Inc" I myself decided to eat only grass fed meat. Animals such as cows and pigs have a very difficult time processing grains especially corn. I didn't think about it before, but why would I feed my Daisy the food I am trying so hard to avoid? The other brands such as Iams is filled with corn. If the the bag says chicken, it should really say: grains with a dash of chicken.<br /><br />Daisy is a Siamese and she just recently finished her 6lb bag and what a difference! Her coat is super silky, she has a leaner "sexier" figure. And she loves the dry food! Before BG she would only eat her dry food as a last resort if we didn't give her wet food. Now she chooses BG over the wet food. The best part is that her poop doesn't smell as bad as it used to. She literally begs for BG every morning and then again at night. She loves it. It may cost more than regular cat food, but think about what you are paying for. Regular cat food is just grains and you should only pay a dollar per bag. The first ingredient in BG is chicken then followed by veggies and fruits.<br /><br />If you love your pet and want to give them the nutrition they deserve, definitely without a doubt feed them Before Grain.

review/summary: We love Merrick BG!
review/text: We were recently adopted by a very sweet lost kitty (we're guessing she is a very young adult). After failed attempts to find her owners, we brought her in and I started researching foods. I quickly decided the cheap, grain-filled brands wouldn't do! The BG is what I chose as a premium, healthful brand and I've been so pleased with it! I give her 1/3 cup morning and evening (along with wet food), and she eats it all. She had a few very smelly bowel movements, which I understand is normal when cats adjust to a new food source, but that has settled down. Her coat went from dull and matted to shiny and healthy in just a couple of days, and she quickly gained a healthy amount of weight (from being seriously UNDERweight when we found her). So far we have only tried chicken flavor but I WILL be getting more Merrick BG!

review/text: Well, my cat is 12 years old and she seems to like the dry chicken food a lot. I leave it out in small amounts so on the days she's extra hungry she can have a bit of dry food as well as wet food. She hasn't had any hairballs since I started giving her this food, which is nice (yes yes, I know captain obvious there). So yeah, it's worth trying, although I'd suggest seeing if your local pet store has it. Might be able to get it cheaper. But yeah, my cat seems to love it and it seems to cut down on hairballs.

review/summary: Nice and Fresh and Tasty.
review/text: Somewhere along the line my toddler got introduced to marshmellows. Perhaps it was due to the fact that my wife uses them in cooking with a few items, sweet potatoes come to mind. In any case, I started using them as little rewards when the boy would do something right, as desert after a meal and as a sprinkling of things in his cereal. He just loves marshmellows. I try to keep the "candy" content of his diet down to a minimum, so I switched over to the smaller miniature marshmellows. He barely noticed. In any case the Kraft brand is excellent. They're nice and tasty and fresh. Perhaps with the next pack I'll try some of the flavored varieties.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Delicious AND LOW Sat-Fat
review/text: These are delicious - crunchy, with a nice firm texture and only a faint banana flavor (the fruit loses its sweetness during the drying process, and only added sugar makes it taste like its fresh form).<br /><br />Other banana chips do tend to have a lot of saturated fat.  The Barry Farm chips contain 0.7 grams of sat fat in a one cup serving - which is about half the bag.  They are high carb and high calorie, but they're also high fiber and cholesterol free.  That all seems reasonable to me, provided that you understand that they're a snack and you can't just toss back an entire bag at one sitting.<br /><br />If you want to check out the nutritional information, head over to the Barry Farm website: [...]<br /><br />***EDITED JUNE2012 - I wrote this review in 2008, and Barry Farm has changed the formula for their banana chips in the interim.  They used to be only dried bananas, and now coconut oil is on the ingredients list on their website.  I edited my review to reflect those changes.  Still love 'em, still buy 'em, just wanted to give everyone a heads-up.***

review/summary: Unsweetened banana chips
review/text: I purchased 2 pkgs of these unsweetened banana chips. I really thought they would be similar to other banana chips that are sweetened.  I wanted some with just a little sweetness but not as sweet as what is normally on the market.  However - I don't like to say anything bad about anything but these absolutely taste like cardboard - there is absolutely NO taste ( you would never guess you were eating bananas if you were blindfolded) and the texture is like cardboard also.  I WOULD NEVER PURCHASE THEM AGAIN.  Sorry... wish I could say something positive about these but I can't in all honestly.

review/summary: Turns a healthy banana into an unhealthy snack
review/text: The quick summary is if you want a banana snack, eat a banana. If you want a portable banana snack that will not bruise, get a banana snack like Trader Joe's 'flattened banana' which is nothing but a flattened banana. These banana chips are labeled as 'unsweetened' which makes you think they are healthy, but they have coconut oil which adds a lot of fat calories of questionable quality. I would suggest pure 100% banana for your banana snack. You don't know anything about the quality of the oil which goes into this product or how damaged the oil gets when it is kept at high heat to prepare these chips. Stick with banana only products without added oil.

review/summary: Magnificent Whisky
review/text: Highland Park produces an amazing line of standard bottlings that range in age from 12 to 50 years.  The king of the hill for us serfs is the 25 year old. The 30 YO is just a touch out of my comfort pricing zone and the 40 and 50 are priced in the stratosphere as investment grade only. So we have the 25 YO as the drinkable top of the line HP. At a cask strength of 48.1% the alcohol has no problem delivering those amazing Highland Park scents to your nose. Word on the street is they are running low on the 25 YO and future bottlings will be at a lower ABV so get it while you can.<br /><br />Imagine the 18 YO only more defined, bolder, and muscular...sherry, honey, vanilla, autumn spices, chocolate, dark fruits, and a very shy old oak cask hiding in the shadows. Only a drop or two of water is all that is needed to soften the alcohol and deliver the nosed flavors to a smooth drying mouth feel --some smoke, caramel apple leading to a long vibrant finish that coaxes out that aged cask, nutty, sweet fruits, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a little honey and smoke and finally that Highland Park trademark mouthwatering affect.  Everything is delivered in exactly the order you expect it to be.<br /><br />A truly magnificent whisky that demonstrates craftsmanship and quality matched by few in the all of the whisk(e)y making world. Not for everyday, but for those special occasions when you want to indulge in a single malt that is expensive, but oh so worth the price of admission. Smart shoppers can find it for the same price as that bloated, vile, over-marketed JW Blue label stuff masquerading as fine whisky. HP 25 YO, db, 48.1% abv = Highest Recommendation.

As a result, this disappointed me even more than if it had been by initial introduction to Taza chocolates. The chocolate/salt mix didn't do it for me, the almond flavor didn't really come through, and the rich darkness of my first Taza experience gave way to a paler, poorer chocolate flavor.<br /><br />I'll go back to the guajillo flavor any day, and I'm still interested in the other Taza flavors. After this discoragement, though, I'll approach them more cautiously.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

review/text: I received a sampler box of Taza Chocolate for my birthday this year from my son.  The salted almond disc was the first one I sampled and I loved it. I love munching on plain almonds and eat them dipped in chocolate sometimes. I enjoyed the hint of almond flavoring in this chocolate and didn't really notice the salty taste too much--it wasn't overbearing for me.<br /><br />The stone ground texture of these are amazing.  It creates little explosions of flavor.  These are among the best chocolate I've eaten.  If you like almond flavoring and you like dark chocolate, I think you might enjoy these.  I'm ordering more for the holidays to have to offer to family and guests.  The discs can be cut into small pie-shaped triangular bites--there are ridges.  So, it's easy to have a bite of dark chocolate every day with these.<br />It's yummy!

review/summary: My FAVORITE Taza flavor
review/text: I love Taza chocolate. At first, the texture took some getting used to but now I love it. I like most of their favors but this is my favorite. They sell their chocolate at my local farmers market and this flavor sells out usually faster than I can get there. If you're new to Taza try this one and their vanilla one and you won't be disappointed.

But around our house, trates don't stay long enough to get stale ;0)<br />I wouldn't go any taller than this size (three sizes are availabe- this is thee middle one) though. I am thinking of getting the smaller size as well.

review/text: I have had this chocolate before at Zingerman's in Ann Arbor, MI. Once again, it just plainly delights all aspects of taste on your tongue.  Other than the cost, it is heavenly to just savor little bits of the dark chocolate and the princely pair flavor, my personal favorite of the bunch.  Buy it and enjoy in a secret corner away from everyone else (or they might take it from you).

review/text: Haribo Happy Cola Gummi Candies are decent for fans of gummies like myself.  I've tried everything from gummi bears to gummi sharks to gummi toes, but gummi cola has a rather strange flavor.  Take a glass bottle of Coke, drink half of it, leave it in the fridge for a couple of days (uncapped) and then drink it again.  This will give you an idea as to how these gummies taste.  It's a flat, refrigerator-tainted Coke taste.  It actually brings back memories as a child of drinking old Coke from the bottle.  That's a plus for older folks like myself.  However, I must admit that there are far better gummies out there.  Try these out if you just have to have a cola flavored gummi.  Otherwise, stick to the sweeter tasting gummies.

review/summary: The BEST glazed donut EVER made
review/text: These are my all time fav donuts!!! Unfortunately they are extremely hard to find in New York. The only time I have ever been able to buy them is when my kids' school would have a fundraiser, but now that my kids are teenagers, the fundraisers have stopped :(. I have searched high and low for these puppies and have been unsuccessful in finding them anywhere. There is a Krispy Kreme shop in Pennsylvania, but that is too far to go and there is one in New York City, but too hard to get to. I had gone on Krispy Kreme's website to order them, but they don't even sell their own donuts on there, which in my opinion is totally lame!!! One time I even spent an entire day searching the net for places that carry them and was told 7-11, Hess and Wal-mart do. So the obsessed woman that I am went to each and every store looking for these, only to find out that they didn't carry them :(. Sooo after feeling totally defeated, I came home and as a last resort I went on amazon. Why I didn't just check them in the first place is beyond me!! Because as I have said in the past, when in doubt, check good ol amazon. I have literally found the weirdest and hardest to find products on here and they have NEVER let me down. I think because it was food or something, I just assumed they wouldn't have them, but I stand corrected!!! Granted they are almost triple the price of a normal box of Krispy Kremes, but when you are desperate (lol), you will pay almost anything and since they are non-existent in my area (sigh) I just suck it up and pay the price.These are my all time fav donuts!!!

I have also bought them from Huggys Haven & Connoisseur Market too, but they are more expensive and take forever to ship their items. I like Moms Express because if there is a problem with your order, she sends you out a new box of donuts free of charge.

review/text: It's been a few years since I've had a KK donut, so when I saw these on Amazon I had to try it at least once.  I corrosponded with the seller to be sure that I would get them as fresh as possible.  By the time they arrived, they were a bit dry.  However, about 10 seconds in the microwave makes them quite soft and good.  But don't expect them to be as good as freshly made!

review/summary: My 1st Krispy Kreme experience was ruined...
review/text: While Krispy Kreme is a popular Donut franchise,I had never had a donut from there before,didn't know what it tasted like to see what the big deal was. Yep. I must've been the last person on earth that never had the opportunity to eat one. I am from New York (Queens)and there are no Krispy Kreme stores near me. There used to be one in Long island, but I think it is now a Verizon store. I know there is one all the way in Manhattan in Penn Station,on the 2nd level (somewhere near the Amtrak)that everyone finds a real "pain" to find. I never thought it was THAT serious to go all the way there just to get a donut.<br /><br />There are a million Dunkin Donuts around..sometimes 2 in the same zone, but no Krispy Kreme spots other than in the Penn Station. Now I went online to Krispy Kreme com to see if I can order and get it shipped to me only to find out that they don't take donut orders. They wanted to assure the "freshness and guarantee"..bummer! I understood though.<br /><br />I found a few seller's in the search engine selling them that pointed to amazon..YAY! Bought from "Huggy's Heaven". The price was a bit high but I figured they'd be worth it for the seller to go get them, package it up, then ship it. I don't know if the mistake was made by ME in that I purchased them in the summer or if the seller took too long to ship it out, but I was VERY disappointed when it arrived. I was told it was "shipped" by priority mail. Then it said it was to arrive between late August to mid September in the message through amazon (confusing).<br />I was really worried about how fresh this would be when it arrived. I was thinking well maybe the seller is waiting on a "batch" of orders for Krispy Kreme,get them all one shot..then ship.<br /><br />It arrived ironically on the same day it expired (there was a sticker on it that said Sept. 9 2011)<br />It was professionally wrapped in cellophane wrap with bubble wrap and even paper wrap with ice packets that were naturally melted because of the time. The outside of the Krispy Kreme donut box was sticky,slimey,and had melted icing all over it like the whole box was dunked into the icing(just messy!)<br /><br />I opened up the box with sticky hands and tried a donut....STALE!! With Slimey icing all over it. No one wanted to try one with me. My friends asked why I would buy it from a private seller and not the store. They also said that stuff could've been tampered with because of this as well.<br />I ended up throwing the whole thing away. I didn't want to get a huge stomach ache from those slimey,wet,stale donuts. Money down the drain. Lesson Learned.<br />I can't even rate Krispy Kreme in the way I wanted because those donuts I purchased from here does not reflect the actual purchasing from an official store. So unless you're purchasing Twinkies that have a 200 year life span or something simple in the foods dept..I don't recommend buying these kind of donuts if you're picky about freshness.

review/text: A couple of the kids in the neighborhood like to play 'Cops and Robbers' when their family is over -- where they're the cops, I'm the perp, and it's 'Violating Civil Rights' week on Law & Order, apparently. And I'm tired of being locked in the basement 'holding cell', or beaten with a sock full of army men, or being Miranda'd with 'the right to remain dorky'.<br /><br />Well, this time I decided to take the 'Cops' into my own hands, and make them the robbers for once.<br /><br />What's better about being a cop than eating doughnuts? Try being a cop with two young perps in custody and eating doughnuts in front of them until they cry their little lawbreaking eyes out. Yeah, that's right -- you kids should have thought about doughnuts before we started pretending you were armed robbers or embezzlers or cow rustlers or whatever.<br /><br />But what's even better than that?<br /><br />Deciding to turn the two young 'perps' into snitches, 'bribing' them with three dozen doughnuts for 'turning state's evidence', and then sending them home with their parents on a sugar high that would make a methadone clinic worker weep. Don't worry, Mom and Dad; the kid's will be asleep by ten. AM. Next Tuesday. Have fun with that!

review/summary: Great texture, very good caramel, but everything is quite lacking
review/text: The combination of real peanuts, chocolate, caramel, and nougat makes for a very satisfying, bite-in-the-bar texture that's a close simulation of a "real" candy bar. The flavor, alas, is still a little "off", which is why I'm giving it only two stars. While the caramel is excellent and the peanuts give a satisfying crunch, the chocolate and the nougat do not have a distinctive flavor, i.e. if blindfolded and given the chocolate or nougat part of the bar, I would not be able to identify what it was.  The chocolate doesn't taste like "chocolate" in other words, but has instead a kind of undifferentiated, artificial sweetener flavor.<br /><br />I actually first wrote a 4-star review for this product, because the texture was so surprisingly satisfying, but after eating 4 bars over the last week I've found it increasingly difficult to stomache the nougat. Thus I've deleted my 4-star review and am replacing it with this one.

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: At first sight, this tea seemed perfect - just what I had been looking for. When I opened it, I noticed that it was a beautiful blend, visually. However, the smell hit me as being overly strong and perfume-y. I didn't think too much of it since I knew that the finished brew will vary in taste and smell. The first time I made it, I forgot to time it and it came out too strong. It was like trying to chug down a bottle of perfume. I ended up throwing most of it out. The second time, I brewed it for a very short time and while it was considerably better, it was nowhere near good. The strong artificial aroma was still there.<br />Part of this is my mistake, because I purchased this tea from a health store in a different tin, on which the ingredients were written directly above other information, so that the last line of the ingredients blended together with the information below, making it very easy to overlook. As my luck would have it, the last line was "nature-identical flavoring", which, when missed, leaves the impression that this blend uses actual strawberries and rhubarb. Even though I should have checked better, I think this tea is bad even for artificially flavored tea. I usually love The TeaSpot teas, but this one was a real disappointment.<br /><br />Bottom line on this product is I would suggest trying it before buying it, even if you don't mind flavored teas. If you're looking for something with real ingredients only, skip this one and try one of The TeaSpot's other wonderful blends.

review/text: I drink strictly decaf coffee and am no fan of "instant" coffee. However, I decided to give these Starbucks VIA sachets a try. What a pleasant surprise! They dissolve immediately when hot water is added. A quick stir and your brew is ready. (It's also nice when you have a tea-drinker in the family, because you boil one kettle of water then pour for tea and coffee without firing up another appliance.) The aroma says, "STARBUCKS." The taste is equally good, just a little "thinner" than what you might get from the beans. Still, tasty and satisfying. These sachets come in handy when I pack my "airline meals," including a couple of them so that I know exactly what I'm drinking while on the airplane. I have videos of my homemade airline meals at my YouTube channel: lenswork4.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I had to give up caffeine and I SORELY MISS COFFEE. Like a lot of people who love coffee I used turned my nose up at decaf. But being forced into the situation and desperately missing the taste of good coffee I tried this product. I went for instant coffee because, it being decaf, I have to go off on my own and segregate myself from the caffeine drinkers with an electric tea kettle.<br /><br />The verdict... LOVE IT. I can drink coffee again, even if it's decaf.<br /><br />The ultimate consumer compliment: I will be buying more.

review/summary: Very Strong
review/text: I ended up only being able to use a portion of these packets because they are so strong.  So strong that I exchanged them for something else.  I'll stick with Starbucks making my drinks for me.

review/summary: can't believe it's instant
review/text: Without luck, I tried to find an excellent decaf K-cup for my Keurig brewer.  Now I heat my water in the Keurig and put decaf Italian brew Starbucks into the water in my cup.  Excellent.  Extra cost is well worth the flavor.  Packaging keeps coffee fresh.

review/summary: good blueberries
review/text: These were really good. True blueberry flavor, no greasy preservative oil, or whatever it is that some of the dried blueberries have on them. I thought they were a good bargain, considering what blueberries can cost, and more natural than some store brands.

review/summary: Nice substitute for the real thing.
review/text: I live where I can't get fresh blueberries and these were an excellent substitute. Texture and taste-wise, think of what raisins are to grapes. I haven't tried it, but I expect they would be good for baking.

review/summary: Packaging let me down!
review/text: Firstly, let me say that the choc pretzels were delicious. However, the packaging was really unsatisfactory. The choc pretzels arrived in an UNPADDED post bag, so by the time I received them, most of the pretzels were crushed or broken. I'd really expect a lot more out of a company handing easily-damaged food product, so I'm only rating this as 2 stars.

review/summary: Good
review/text: Pretty good.  Just know a couple of things.  These are large sized pretzels not small ones and they come in a box that isn't exactly protected from a lot of shaking and what not so you'll find quite a few crumbs and broken pieces but that's tasty too.  I'm ordering again.  Thanks

review/summary: WAY OVERPRICED!! But Great Stuff
review/text: I could go to a gas station and buy 24 for $23.76 ($0.99/ea.).  But these are $2.71 each.  And at the gas station you have more variety.  But it is great stuff and I do honestly have one everyday from regular to peach.

I brought two cases it was 48 cans in one HUGE BOX and 99% of them had dents in them the cans was sticky.  Then cans neededto be washed with Bleach because it some of everythng around the top of the cans.  In the past I got them in the orignal 24 Case witha cardboard and plastic around each case.  Not this time they were all single just threw in a HUGE BOX.

review/summary: Buying in bulk was cheaper, a little banged up on arrival.
review/text: I was buying these so I wouldn't have to stop at the store every day before work. Buying these from amazon with the Prime perk allowed me to get these for about $0.67 a can. They shipped quickly and arrived in two days. All this left me a happy camper.<br /><br />They were however a little banged up on arrival but all the cans are intact and none sustained anything more than a couple dents here and there.<br /><br />Will buy again.

review/summary: best iced tea everrrrr
review/text: i dont really enjoy arizona iced teas...rasberry is ok though. but one day i was thirsty and they are only $.99 so i got this one. and i have not stopped drinking it ever since!!!! everyone at work knows this is my favorite. my whole family knows. the cvs down the street knows that i only come there for this. it is truly the best tasting iced tea i have ever had. i am very particular about my teas because they are always not sweet enough or toooooo sweet. but this is perfect. i buy like 3 at a time so i figured let me see if i can just buy in bulk from amazon. i know they are full of sugar, but i think i am addicted to the arnold palmer half and half. i even got my little sister drinking it. it truly is amazing.....
