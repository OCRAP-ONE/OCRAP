review/summary: It is not real Acai
review/text: I am dissapointed!! When I bought this product I thought I was buying the real Acai Tea. But when I read ingredients it occured that Acai is the only one of the ingredients from a lot of others. So I blamed myself because I had to read those ingredients before I bought this Tea. I was fooled because the tea is named as "Acai Tea" so I thought it really was Acai. I reccomend everybody to read ingredients carefully before buying the product.

review/text: nothing comes realatively cheap these days and still get the satisfaction.  I love stash tea, as it presents both good value (via amazon) and offers a little luxury amongst its peers.  There are more expensive brands, but as a brand, this one cuts about the rest.  I love the chamomile version and it is a sure winner in the taste section too. Highly recommend and thanks amazon for making it so affordable.

review/text: Locorice even in small amounts raises my blood pressure to dangerous levels. My doctor began to have problems regulating my high blood pressure soon after beginning to drink Stash teas, which (almost all) I discovered contain licorice.<br /><br />I recommend either that Stash remove licorice from their teas or they carry a warning label for persons with high blood pressure be aware.

review/text: I thought for sure I was going to love this tea. I love licorice and I like my teas sweet. I was so disappointed in the flavor of this product! It has very little licorice taste and an almost sickening after taste and smell. I added sugar to it as I did not find it very sweet. I ordered the 6 box pack of this so I guess I have 5 boxes of it to give away

review/summary: Licorice Lovers--You must check this out!
review/text: Those of you who love licorice or anise flavor and who happen to be tea-drinkers, rejoice! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic. The anise/licorice flavor is intense. The tea is relatively sweet, so in my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary, but you may want to add a little honey to it. This is not a wimpy tea, but full bodied and the longer you steep it, the stronger it gets.

review/summary: Delicious and soothing
review/text: I first tried this tea 4 years ago when a friend introduced it to me at work.  I was able to buy it at Trader Joes but they discontinued stocking it in my local store about a year ago.  I then found this online directly from Stash and bought boxes at a time.  I am a person who finds it hard to drink water but this herb tea helps me drink up to 10 huge mugs of it a day. Lemon and ginger combination is perfect to satisfy the need for sweet with a little bite at the end with the ginger. It has also helped me stop drinking caffeine drinks which lets me now sleep at night.  I will continue to buy this and recommend it highly.

review/summary: Tried it...loved it...now my favorite herbal tea
review/text: Based on the other review, I went and tried this tea.  As a choir member, I am always interested in licorice products since they soothe a worn voice.  However, many of the teas I have tried have too much ginger in it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this tea.<br /><br />1) The licorice taste is subtle, but definitely present.<br /><br />2) No sugar necessary.  As a dentist, I love this.  The licorice flavor doesn't jump out at you at first, but around 4 or 5 seconds after swallowing, the licorice "dances" around the sides of your tongue.  I don't know how else to describe it, but it really does dance.  I've never had that before.  Brilliant!<br /><br />3) It's best when over-steeped - like 10 minutes.<br /><br />4) Most grocery stores I've been to carry this, so it's readily available should you find yourself staring at an empty box early in the evening.

review/summary: Basic Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea
review/text: ***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***

review/summary: Rather weak and non-descript tea
review/text: There are several other Stash teas that I've tried and enjoyed. But this one is sort of feeble-tasting.  Up until now, I've gotten the Yogi Tea Egyptian Licorice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QL6">Yogi Tea Organic Egyptian Licorice, Tea Bags, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>and that one actually has a bold licorice taste.  And it is that one that is serving as the point of comparison to this Stash tea.  Keep in mind that I don't add honey or any sweetner to my teas, so they have to stand on their own.  This Stash Licorice Spice has a weak licorice taste and a weak spice taste.  I have to use TWO teabags at a time (which makes the seemingly low price not so much a good deal).

review/summary: Subtle, Mild Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for over 35 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Fruit-Flavoured Tea
review/text: Stash is a very good quality, full-bodied tea and I am a big-time tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea since probably before Superman was born.  I like to keep a bunch of different flavoured teas around, especially some fruity flavours.  I call them dessert teas because I usually don't eat dessert, but I like to have a fruit tea after dinner.  Stash tea bags are usually, if not always, individually sealed in a foil-type packet, so the flavour stays fresh for a long time.<br /><br />The acai berry flavor is delicious!  It has a nice natural sweetness and a very fruity taste.  It is very smooth and is a caffeine free herbal tea.  The 100% natural ingredients, listed in this order, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, orange peel, chicory root, blackberry flavor, blackcurrant flavor, acai flavor, acai fruit powder, and licorice powder.  Contains soy.

Licorice root can raise blood pressure. I don't have either condition, but after finding that out, decided that this was better as an occasional treat (as opposed to a daily ritual.)

It is soothing to the throat and digestive system, and contains natural expectorants and antispasmodics.  As such, I've found it to be a great reliever for coughs, cold or allergy symptoms such as congestion and sneezing, and even painful periods. Today I swear by this stuff and always have to have a box around for sickness. I've thrown away all my cold medicines and cough syrups, the natural herbs in this tea are better for you and almost as effective without the side effects of drowsiness or confusion. Not a doctor, just a happy customer.

Just donated the unopened boxes of it to a food kitchen, I hope someone there enjoys it.  I love all different kinds of tea, but this was the worst I've ever had!

review/summary: Smooth not Bitter
review/text: Best chamomile on the mainstream supermarket shelves. Other chamomile teas have had a bitter aftertaste, but this one by Stash is really smooth and fresh. It's neither strong nor bland, just floral and pleasant. Reminds me slightly of chrysanthemum. It doesn't make me sleepy or keep me up, for what it's worth. I had some primo stuff at a local coffeeshop that tasted much like the Stash brand, but had an awesome citrusy floral aroma; been wanting to find something like that for a while, and so far this Stash Chamomile comes closest.

review/text: This tea is really tasty...I wasn't even a tea person until tasting this, and once I did, I was hooked. The flavor is light and super-refreshing but you can still taste and smell the mint. The only reason why I took off one star is because I tend to like things that taste strongly, and this one is a little bit delicate for me. To remedy that, I either steep it with hibiscus or black tea, or I steep it at double strength and all is well.<br />Putting it with honey and stevia also tastes great, and makes me feel better when I have colds. I love this tea!

review/text: This is the first camomile tea that actually maintains the most of the medicinal properties of camomile!! So far it is the best out of five different brands we got to try in USA including various organic, so called farmaceutic quality, etc.. To give a specific example of this tea's well-preserved qualities: it really helps us get rid of extra water in our bodies, nearly as good as "water pills"  doctors recommend. One packet in a small cup does great.. And can be repeated if you need.  We have subscribed to receive it from Amazon on a regular basis - the price is better then in a supermarket.

review/summary: Absolutely the best tea I've ever had
review/text: I'm not a big tea drinker. I keep buying different types of tea convinced I'll like them, and each one turns out to be completely different than I anticipated. In other words, I think all teas taste generally the same: like hot water. Even with sugar - then they taste like hot water with sugar. But this tea is completely different.<br /><br />I love licorice. This tastes exactly like licorice. It smells like licorice (clearly from the anise, since licorice root basically smells like cooked bark). It doesn't need sugar. It's sweet. It has an 'aftertaste' of licorice. In other words, it's perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately no store I've ever been to has carried it, although I look EVERY TIME I walk down the tea aisle. Even if they did, it wouldn't be that awesome, since this is pretty much the same exact price it would go for in, say, Target. Unfortunately it is 6 boxes...but I really don't think you can have enough of this stuff.<br /><br />After some trial-and-error, I can now say that, of the few other licorice teas that do exist, nothing really comes close to Stash. I've tried a weird Celestial tea  mix of  licorice root + 3 other things (tastes like hot water), Batavia Anise tea (hot water with a licorice aroma), and store brand Albrecht Heijn Zoethout tea (from the Netherlands - smells like hot bark but tastes exactly like this tea. Unfortunately it's completely nonexistent here.) What I've discovered on my quest fs that only a few brands even attempt to make JUST licorice tea (it's not popular here, and it baffles me that people don't appreciate the taste), and of those only Stash is successful.<br /><br />Buy it. Amazon is a good deal and it's soooo good.

review/text: Well, I understand that since it is Licorice Spice tea it would have some licorice smell and taste, but it is just too much for me. If you use 1 bag of it in your cup you are getting light yellow liquid with a very strong licorice taste and smell. I am using it in a tea pot mixing with other teas then it is working better.

It gives a calming effect and does help sooth your throat if you are coming up with a cold or something. A great product and I am happy with the fact that we can buy it on Amazon in bulk at a very good price.<br />If you love Herbal tea do try this product from Stash it is good.

review/summary: Different and Tasty
review/text: I am a tea drinker from way back and Stash is an excellent tea.  This flavor has a smooth strawberry/pomegranate taste and is delicious.  It is a red tea (red in colour) and red because its primary ingredient is Rooibos, which is red tea and is slightly sweet.  Also included (in this order) are rosehips, hibiscus flowers, raspberry leaves, citric acid, and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour.<br /><br />I did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients.  This info is what I found reported in a few different sources:<br /><br />Rooibus tea:<br />Rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have 50 times more antioxidant power than green tea. It also has other antioxidants not found in other teas.  The effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in Rooibus tea.  Rooibus tea is completely pure and natural .  It contains no additives, preservatives or colorant.  It is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension.  It has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system.  Rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.  It has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants.  It also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, hearrtburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. It supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and flouride, and it contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid. I was also told that red tea does not have ECOG, a healthful property that green tea does have. That is why I drink both red tea and green tea, to get the best of all worlds.<br /><br />Rosehips is supposed to be good for infections, bladder problems, and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin C.<br />Hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic (fluid release) and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />If I had only two words to describe the taste of this tea, they would be fruity and smooth.  It is also caffeine free.  It is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after-dinner comfort drink.  Stash makes a good full bodied tea, stronger than some of these cheapie teas, so I find I only need one bag per a 24 oz cup. (Of course, that all depends on your preference.)  These special Stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display.<br /><br />BTW--I am not a doctor--(my disclaimer)--just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care.  As with any product, consult your health cae provider, especially if you are on medications.

review/text: Stash's Cinnamon Apple Chamomile is a comforting blend of apples, hibiscus, chamomile and cinnamon. I use two teabags per cup as it gives the tea a much more full-bodied flavor. I've tasted quite a few cinnamon-apple teas and this one is my favorite. There is not too much cinnamon and just enough apple flavor. It is even more delicious when sweetened with a huckleberry honey. You will want to drink this tea while decorating for Christmas or while eating a piece of cake.

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry Delight
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: What's With the Weird Sensation Seconds After Sipping?
review/text: I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor "blossomed" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea "dances around the sides of your tongue."  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the "flavor burst", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The "flavor burst" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil.

review/summary: Stashed Premium Chamomile Herbash
review/text: After a lengthy trek in the Himalayan Range, the Himalayas, or Himalayalabalyakamonkatonka for short, in Tibetan, (a mountain range in Asia, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau), I was in bad shape.  First of all, my scrotum shrunk from the extended lack of healthy oxygen.  Secondly, I had all sorts of intestinal problems due to my diet of yak meat only.  Thirdly, I had plenty of holes in my socks and underpants.<br /><br />I eventually made it to a small town in China where I visited the local Apothecary.  A man, if I recall correctly, by the name of Ying Yang Ping Pong Luke, recommended Chamomile Herbal Tea.  I had often heard of the healing properties of it in old and ancient Zulu scripts (pictographic and ideographic) but had never tried it since I despised teas.<br /><br />Well, after a few months on a Chamomile Herbal Tea only diet plus brown rice, I was fixed up.  Chamomiles are medicinal plants.  They are  emmenagogues, stomachics, carminatives, diaphoretics, antispasmodics, and sedatives.<br /><br />In my case, Chamomile Herbal Tea fought intestinal gas and stimulated my gastric juices and encouraged my appetite.<br /><br />Stash Premium Chamomile Herbal Tea is very weak so some won't like it.  I do because you can drink a nice hot cup before bed and it helps you.  It has no flavor aside from a bitter taste of weed but again, I think of it more as a comfort Tea than something pleasurable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HFBMQ">Neti Pot Starter Kit with 1.5 Oz Aromatic Salt Original Neti Pot Salt</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I21K18">Adagio Teas PersonaliTea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket</a><br /><br />Nature's Way - Chamomile Flowers, 350 mg, 100 capsules

review/summary: Great for colds/flu
review/text: This tea is a lifesaver during cold and flu season.  The ginger helps with an upset stomach, the lemon is uplifting and calming at the same time, and when you add some honey it's a great sore throat soother.  I love it and always keep some in my pantry.  I haven't tried it as an iced tea but it's great hot.

review/text: I like this tea a lot.  We buy it in bulk.  I have found that you shouldn't leave the bag in the water too long; it acquires and odd taste then.  Otherwise it is flavorful and helps to clear out the phlegm.  Licorice is a natural expectorant.  I also use another product called: "Sanderson's Throat Specific Mixture" to help clear my throat.  It is an amazing product.

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: I decided to be risky and order a big box on unknown tea - this stuff, along with big boxes of Blueberry and Raspberry.  The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting.  Couldn't taste the strawberry.  Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea.  I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.<br /><br />I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up.  When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers.

review/text: I had a hard time finding the tea I had purchased in the past at my local market.  They had stopped carring the flavor of tea I like eventhough they still carried Stash Tea products.  So I went on the internet and was directed to Amazon and found it right away.  Not only that, the pricing was very competitive and I received delivery including freight and handleing cheaper than I could purchase the tea at the market.  By the way Wild Rasberry Hibiscus is a very good flavor if anyone wants to be adventersome and try it.

review/summary: The absolute best herbal tea
review/text: My sister suggested this tea to me.  I was looking for a good herbal tea to limit my caffeine, and one I could have in the evening.  Most herbal teas seem very weak to me.  I'm not a big licorice fan, but this doesn't taste strongly of licorice.  As one of the other reviewers said, it just gives you a slightly sweet, slightly licorice aftertaste, which is delightful.  It's great in the evening when I'm craving something sweet - and no calories or caffeine!

review/summary: I'm Wild for this Wild Raspberry Tea
review/text: Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.

review/text: I tried this tea for the first time at a restaurant - 1st time iced - cool & refreshing, 2nd time hot - mmmm. The taste leans more to the ginger side and not the lemon. I have tried other brands such as Yogi and Twinings. I did not like the Yogi brand at all (yuck!), the Twinings' brand while not disgusting taste like lemon tea with a 'hint' of ginger. I have tasted other brands that have a stronger ginger taste than Stash but they've also had a strange taste to them as well so so far Stash is my favorite. This tea is great for upset tummy.

review/text: This is the herbal remedy of choice for those times when I something gross, such as anything from McNasty's or Nasty King. I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water. I like to watch it change color for five minutes, then I sip it and enjoy the sweet relief. The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes.

I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: Decent coffee fix
review/text: Full disclosure: I am a strong/dark coffee fan and a energy drink regular. I usually don't mix the two, but that's why I thought I'd give this product a try.<br /><br />First off, these are 9.6 cans so more like a normal Red Bull can than the big regular Monster drink ones. Inside, it seems like it's only about 3/4 full - half with drink and half with "foam." This makes the taste and feel very light.<br /><br />The taste is almost like a watered down Starbucks frappaccino (the pre-packaged kind) but with a metallic aftertaste. It's pleasant enough to feel like you're having a cold coffee drink, but the one can is more than enough for me.<br /><br />Because the caffeine is included in a mix (GLUCOSE, CAFFEINE, INOSITOL, GLUCURONOLACTONE, GUARANA, L-CAMITINE, MALTODEXTRIN), you cannot tell how many mg are in the can precisely, but that mix is 2,500mg. In addition to that blend there is 100% DV of B2, B3, B6, B12, 1000mg of taurine, and 200mg panax ginseng. I get a little perk after drinking this, but not much compared to a can of Red Bull or Rockstar.<br /><br />The packaging was good and tight and no cans were damaged or dented in the process. The tabs are wonky, however, and when you pop the top the metal flap does not go all the way down necessitating an extra press with your thumb to move it down. This has been the case with 4 of the 4 cans I've had so far.

review/text: I spent days trying to find decent coconut water/juice in order to make shakes, and since I'm a health nut, I try to control my sugar intake. Every coconut water product I looked at is full of sugar, and this brand is no different. An amazing 29 grams of sugar per can. Also, this product is only 70% juice! What's the other 30 percent? An average can of soda contains 30 grams, for comparison. I know they make unsweetened coconut water, but I can't find it. Why in the world do manufactures feel the need to sweeten things that are already fine and sweet? Alright, maybe a little sugar, but 29grams? I'm drinking this because I care about my health and don't want to drink soda! Leave it to them to take something perfect the way it is, and make it just as bad as soda! Don't wonder why they don't post this nutritional information on the product page; they don't want you to know it.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a decent enough product if you don't care about unnecessary sugar intake. Very sweet, but these manufacturers don't understand that you don't need to add so much sugar to a naturally sweet product! There IS a market for unsweetened coconut water, guys.

These are delicious, and just as described.  Small, tasty, and perfect with lamb shanks, lamb stew, or really anything else for that matter (though they won't substitute for Mexican refried beans or black beans in many south of the border recipes).

There's a recipe on the back of the bag about how to make a lovely French stew with said beans, and it was very tasty. (The stew is slightly creamy with tomatoes and savory spices. Delicious.)  The best thing about them: they are soak-free!!!  Most beans require an overnight soaking time, but these are similar to lentils and peas in that they do not need to be soaked and actually shouldn't be soaked in advance.<br /><br />Take a chance...heirloom beans are delightful!

review/summary: "Yogurt" raisins? No,  trans fat sunblock raisins!!
review/text: Ingredient list on the package (which as we know goes from most to least): California raisins, yogurt coating (sugar,partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil, nonfat milk powder, nonfat yogurt powder, whey, titanium dioxide, soy lecithin, vanilla), confectioners glaze, corn syrup, dextrin and maltodextrin.<br /><br />This "yogurt coating" is basically sugar and partially hydrogenated oil, in other words TRANS FAT, which has undeniable harmful effects on your health. Palm oil is saturated fat, anyways. All the yogurt it conatins is a tiny bit of yogurt POWDER. And it has titanium dioxide, which is also an effective sun block that you wingredient<br /><br />Look at all that sugar named in different ways: sugar, confectioners glaze and corn syrup. As for the titanium dioxide, from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Pigment<br />"...When deposited as a thin film, its refractive index and colour make it an excellent reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors and some gemstones like "mystic fire topaz". TiO2 is also an effective opacifier in powder form, where it is employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, medicines (i.e. pills and tablets) as well as most toothpastes. In paint, it is often referred to offhandedly as "the perfect white", "the whitest white", or other similar terms. Opacity is improved by optimal sizing of the titanium dioxide particles.<br />In ceramic glazes titanium dioxide acts as an opacifier and seeds crystal formation.<br />Titanium dioxide is often used to whiten skimmed milk; this has been shown statistically to increase skimmed milk's palatability.[23]<br />Titanium dioxide is used to mark the white lines on the tennis courts of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, best known as the venue for the annual grand slam tennis tournament The Championships, Wimbledon.[24]<br />The exterior of the Saturn V rocket was painted with titanium dioxide; this later allowed astronomers to determine that J002E3 was the S-IVB stage from Apollo 12 and not an asteroid.<br /><br />Sunscreen and UV absorber<br /><br />In cosmetic and skin care products, titanium dioxide is used as a pigment, sunscreen and a thickener. It is also used as a tattoo pigment and in styptic pencils. Titanium dioxide is produced in varying particle sizes, oil and water dispersible, and with varying coatings for the cosmetic industry. This pigment is used extensively in plastics and other applications for its UV resistant properties where it acts as a UV absorber, efficiently transforming destructive UV light energy into heat.<br />Titanium dioxide is found in almost every sunscreen with a physical blocker because of its high refractive index, its strong UV light absorbing capabilities and its resistance to discolouration under ultraviolet light. This advantage enhances its stability and ability to protect the skin from ultraviolet light. Sunscreens designed for infants or people with sensitive skin are often based on titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide, as these mineral UV blockers are believed to cause less skin irritation than other UV absorbing chemicals. The titanium dioxide particles used in sunscreens have to be coated with silica or alumina, because titanium dioxide creates radicals in the photocatalytic reaction. These radicals are carcinogenic, and could damage the skin.

review/summary: favorite snack
review/text: We've been buying these for years, for the simple reasons that they taste great and are actually good for you. Usually, I'll pour some in a little bowl and mix them up with a few peanuts or other nuts. We've tried the chocolate yogurt raisins, but don't like them as much. So vanilla it is. Excellent snack food.

review/text: A nice balsamic for the price point.  Great in salad dressings.  I even dip carrots and celery in it to make a veggie snack more interesting.  Helps to make low calorie eating less boring.  Sent some to my sister too and she loved it.

review/summary: My all time favorite Balsamic Vinegar!
review/text: I bought a bottle of this balsamic when on vacation last summer. I have been very careful to only use it for special occasions as I was not sure I would be able to get more. I am so glad Amazon carries it - now I can use it more (although at this price, I will still have to be careful). The flavor is sweet and mild, great for dipping bread with olive oil or making salad dressing. My whole family loves it!

review/summary: Delicious Treat
review/text: Product arrived super fast and was packed with 2 koolit packs to keep the chocolate from melting.  Even though it was hot out, the product was perfect.  This has been one of my favorite childhood treats, and this was the first time I have ordered from this source.  While it was not quite the same as others I have had, the candy was still delicious and I have totally enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering again.

review/text: Sencha is a very delicate tasting tea, which is really overpowered by the orange and other flavors.  On the plus side, the tea leaves seem to be of good quality, though, again, their flavor is a bit lost.

review/summary: Divine brew
review/text: What is so great about this tea is it's ability to be brewed in almost any way provided water is below boiling temp as with all green tea. What is missed by making this a 1 cup at a time tea is the immensity of the brew when it's allowed to truly form in the pot. It's true that the pungent orange blossoms are strong, but when given enough room to expand the initial sharp taste becomes a subtle aftertaste. And that's how the green tea works into your system with such ease, because you're gradually absorbing the taste of it tempered by the orange. Want proof of this add any other citrus like apple for instance and see how the orange will gladly stay in the background for it. Or for those who make Kombucha try an amazing base for it with this tea. And no tea will complement my organic beer as well. There's been times where I have drank myself dizzy on the green tea just because I was so absorbed in the brewing flavors. But even after taking a break from it the want of it always comes back and that's how I know the tea is true because like the other reviewers not many appeal to me. I've been drinking this tea solid for about 2 years now nearly every day - more than once a day always - letting the pot sit on a warmer on top of the wood stove during cold weather. When the weather is warm a hot pot in the morning makes an excellent ice tea in the afternoon and evening as well.

review/summary: Just wonderful
review/text: I am new to tea drinking, sorry all these 47 years went by without knowing how excellent tasting tea can be. I waited for this Two Leaves and Bud Organic Orange Sencha product, that I ordered along with a new tea pot. This tea is just wonderful! Best orange flavored yet, and I disagree with one of the reviews, it does not over-power the beverage. I'm also looking forward to investigating many of the other loose teas. It'll be awhile though, this first ever purchase also brought the pleasant surprise that three 8oz bags is one hell of a lot of tea!! Guess my tea drinking group at work will also be enjoying the spoils of this find and others as I continue my new found love, tea (coffee now only perhaps one cup a day, sometimes none).

review/summary: Perhaps I don't love green tea as much as the other reviewers, but I love this one!
review/text: My  husband is English, so I drink a lot of strong black tea (with milk). I drink green tea mostly because it's good for me, and I find most of them have a bit of a bite or aftertaste (even when brewed properly). The orange in this one is dreamy and delightful. It's a pleasure just to unseal the pouch. Orange Sencha makes great ice tea, too. I guess it's not for purists, but it's  just right for me.

review/summary: Good Quality Loose Leaf Tea
review/text: I've had better sencha green tea, but for the sale price I paid for this tea it was well worth it (~$12 for 1.5 lbs). I personally think the orange is very subtle, maybe too subtle for my tastes. This is my first purchase of Two leaves and a Bud tea and I would buy from them again.
