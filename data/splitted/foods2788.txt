review/summary: TULLYRIFIC!
review/text: I had to switch to decaf several years ago due to an ulcer. We recently purchased a Cuisinart kcup brewer. I had been having quite a time finding a great tasting decaf kcup. I ordered a sample pack from another site and it contained one of the Tully's. It was sooo good, I can't begin to tell you how excited I was!<br /><br />I hopped online in search of the best price for the quantity on these kcups! I found it here.<br /><br />This coffee reminds me of a warm, nutty toasty regular cup of joe that I used to get at a local restaurant!

review/summary: Don't Buy this!
review/text: We buy a lot of K-cups for our Keurig, typically going through about 4-6 a day. We often buy various ones to satisfy different tastes.<br /><br />This is the only brand that we have purchased that has given us problems. Not only have the k-cups exploded, leaving grounds all over the machine both inside and out, but every single k-cup in the two 24-count packages has done this. At first, we thought we just received a bad batch in one of the two packages that was a part of the order, but when the k-cups in both of the packages did this for k-cup after k-cup (there wasn't a single one that did not explode and leave coffee ground in the coffee mug, machine, or outside of the machine), we knew it wasn't a fluke.<br /><br />Since there is no return on food...buyer beware.

review/summary: Good tasting coffee, poor quality k-cups
review/text: I just want to chime in with the other reviewers who noted the poor quality of these k-cups. Half of the k-cups I purchased explode in my coffee machine because the foil over the top of the cup is not sealed properly. Not only is it disappointing and a waste of money, it's a real pain to clean your machine after an explosion of coffee grounds. This is unfortunate because I think Tully's has the best quality coffee, particularly decaf, you can find out there in k-cups right now. I heard Starbucks is going to get in the k-cup business at some point. Hopefully sooner than later.

review/text: I need to drink more decaffeinated coffee. Thus, I tried this product out for my Keurig coffee maker. And I have thoroughly enjoyed the experiment! Some of the K-cup blends that I have tried are terrific, some are okay, and some don't have much taste. This product is closer to the good end of that continuum than to the bad end.<br /><br />It is labeled "extra bold." Perhaps not quite so. Still, it does have a rich taste and is a delightful way to begin the day.<br /><br />So, I am a satisfied customer and intend to keep drinking this particualr brand.

review/text: I love to have a cup of coffee at night but I'm always leery of how caffeine might affect me.  Tully's Decaf House Blend is perfect!!  During the day I drink Newman's Own Organic Special Blend and in the evening I have a cup of Tully's.  While they don't taste exactly alike (Tully's is a little weaker, I'd say) it's still a great alternative.  It's so hard to find a good decaf and I'm thrilled that I finally found one!!  It's fairly strong and bold but not skunky or overpowering in it's flavor.  I highly recommend it!!

review/text: I ordered these k cups by mistake, I meant to order the Tully's decaf French Roast, which I love.  This coffee is even better!  I usually don't care for house roasts, I was even really disappointed when I opened the Amazon box and realized my mistake.  I decided to try it instead of sending it back and I'm glad I did!  I like a darker and richer cup of coffee, and this one is nice and dark and very smooth.  It's not watery like many decaf coffees and it doesn't taste like the donut shoppe type coffees that I really dislike that decaf coffee always seems to taste like.  It also makes an excellent iced coffee on the smallest setting on the Keurig B70 Platinum.  I sometimes make iced coffee on the 5-1/4 cup setting and it still comes out pretty strong.  It's really the perfect decaf coffee.  Even better than at the coffee house!  You will not be disappointed!

I called the company and they are aware of the complaint and have had others. I really wish this didn't happen because the coffee is so good. This is the second time purchasing this product where this happened. It is so difficult to find a really good decaf so I am really disapointed. I do have to say that Amazon's customer service in resolving this issue was excellent. They imediately got back to me, offered a refund and are looking into this issue. Hopefully this issue will be taken care of for future purchases.

review/summary: My favorite
review/text: Of the decaf K-cups I have tried, this is my new favorite and the only decaf I stock in my house.  It is strong, but smooth without any bite.  I serve it to my husband sometimes, who hates decaf, and he likes it.  Emeril's was good, but I believe this is better.  For some guests in my house, it may be too strong.  I just make 16 oz. with it in an oversized mug, then split it and it still tastes fine that way.

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: I bought these at Target hoping they wouldn't be just another crappy tasting healthier-alternative food - they're AWESOME! I looked on Amazon to see if I can find them cheaper (they're about the same price unless I subscribe), and realized there was only one review on it. I love reading reviews before settling on what to buy and therefore I feel I must contribute!<br /><br />These are certainly granola cookies, meaning it's like eating a cookie with some dried oats in it, but the chunky chocolate semi-sweet chips make for a perfect blend. I'm not into granola bars or oatmeal cookies, but these are great! Throw 1-2 together for a snack or as part of your work/school lunch and it's a nice top-off for the meal.<br /><br />I think if I could gripe about anything it is the amount of cookies in each box (eight) - there should be more! Keep in mind that these cookies are a tad wider than a Chips Ahoy cookie and a bit thicker than an Oreo. I'm a chocoholic and I was shocked to find that a single one of these satisfied me just fine, which is very unusual for a cookie for someone like me (I like eating 5-6 Oreos at once and still want more but have to resist). The serving size is one cookie and each cookie has 10g of whole grains, 130 calories and 45 calories from fat, 2g fiber and 20g of carbs.

Granted, I have a bit of a chocolate obsession (when I travel, I bring a box of these with me) but they are by far my favorite cookie. I don't have the super-sweet tooth my children do. They are not at all too rich, and have a good chew (the first ingredient is whole grain oats). They are the perfect balance of sweetness and chocolate-y yumminess.

review/summary: Watery....Hardly Any Noodles Or Veggies...
review/text: This is my second outing into making a Cugino's soup.  I bought a couple of packages at a local market here recently.  I didn't care for the other flavor I bought (Minestrone) for the same reason I don't like this one.  This pouch makes a half gallon of soup all right with a passable stock.  But the fixens in the way of veggies and noodles they give you are pathetic.  Even if you like your soup loose and watery I think you will still want a little more than this gives you.  I had to add extra macaroni and can of veggies just to make it passable in my opinion. There is just about a half cup of dry noodles in this soup that is supposed to be enough for a half gallon.  No way as far as I am concerned.  The Bear Creek chicken noodle soup mix makes a pretty darn good soup all by itself if you're in the mind for no extras, and I suggest you opt for that over this brand any time...: )

review/text: I have been using these breadcrumbs for the past 3 years to make chicken tenders for my gluten, soy, dairy, egg and peanut allergic son.  Don't try to use them like regular breadcrumbs with gluten in them...I first dip my chicken in tapioca starch seasoned with salt and pepper.  Then I dip the chicken into a mix of rice milk and olive oil mixed to the consistency of heavy cream, then I dip the chicken into the breadcrumbs.  I pan fry them in olive, canola or sunflower oil, (whatever I have on hand) for about 3 minutes on each side.  The are crispy on the outside and moist on the inside!  I make large batches and freeze them so I have them ready for a quick lunch or dinner for my son.  Our entire family loves these.<br /><br />In addition to the chicken tenders I have also used the Glutino breadcrumbs to make breaded zucchini.

review/text: I had to go gluten free and these are a good substitute for regular bread crumbs. I've used them for breading and do agree a little goes a long way. I was able to get them to crisp easily in the oven and was very happy with the outcome. I've also used them as a binding for meatloaf and meatballs. Just be careful because you need much less of these than regular bread crumbs since they seem to take the moisture out of the mix faster.

review/text: They are ok. But not really worth paying the price or going out of your way to get them. I found that the breading would fall off, and sides that werent on the heat got VERY soggy throughout the cooking process. Probably increasing the falling off. However some got very crunchy and those tasted great. For 3+ dollars a small bag its not really worth it. Ill stick with rice a lot cheaper and not as many problems.

review/summary: Super Scent & Taste
review/text: My sister decided to make her own peppermint patties. They came out great. Then she came up with the idea to try wintergreen flavor. Well not so easy to find wintergreen extract, but I found it for her here on Amazon. She made the wintergreen flavored patties & they were super wintergreen , the first batch was quite strong wintergreen flavor. The flavoring is potent a little goes a long way. You don't need much to get the flavor & the smell is delightful. A little change in the amount & the next batch was perfect.I would guess it depends on how strong you want them to taste of wintergreen.  Great quality extract definetly worth the price. I would recommend this product to any cook who's looking for a good wintergreen extract. Great Extract !! Buy again if needed.

When I got back there were elephant size leaves.  I guess I should have purchased something lower maintenance.

Maybe it's just me, but the aftertaste of this tea tasted like soap.  I didn't realize it, but it has artificial flavors in it.  Perhaps it comes from that.  I ended up throwing this away and taking a loss.<br /><br />If you are looking for alternatives,  China Mist is a far superior brand of iced tea than this stuff.  However shipping is expensive unless you buy a lot of it.  Twinings makes a cold brew berry flavor tea that is decent (I rated 3/5 stars).  Much better than this anyway.

review/text: I ordered the Lesser Evil Sour Cream Krinkle Sticks after trying a bag of the regular flavor Krinkle Sticks as recommended by the hungry girl website.  The original flavor was great, low-fat and a good potato chip substitute.  Strangely, my three year old adores these and calls them "crunchy french fries."  Amazon has these at a great price versus what my local grocery store charges, so I went ahead and ordered a box of the Sour Cream and Onion flavor.  They're good, but I must admit I think the original flavor is better.  I'm surprised as I'm a flavored chip junkie!  However, the sour cream and onion flavor seems to lack salt and I noticed most of the powder flavoring ends up in the bottom of the bag.  Don't get me wrong, they're good--I just prefer the original flavor.

review/text: These are great whether you're looking for a lowfat snack or are on a gluten-free diet.  They retail for $2.99/bag at Target (some places are higher), so if you can get it under $35/case with free shipping, you are saving money. Enjoy!

review/summary: Subtle flavor, very healthy for you!
review/text: This is a really good alternative to unhealthy chips and french fries. I really like the subtle sour cream and onion flavor.  It's very crunchy, and can be kind of dry, but it's good by itself or with a hotdog or hamburger.  Some people that I made try it didn't like the texture, but personally I loved it!<br /><br />Be careful though! It's a LOT of bags! it's a pretty big box! I was shocked! It will last me a long time!<br /><br />Happy munching!

review/summary: These USED TO BE AWESOME.
review/text: EDIT: April 2011<br /><br />Despite my previous statement, these are no longer the best baked low fat snack ever. Not anymore. Sadly, they changed the ingredients. They added rice, took away certain seasonings, and added a DISGUSTING tasting ACID. It tastes like im eating a LEMON. This tastes like a completely different snack - I dont buy it anymore. WHY OH WHY DID THEY CHANGE THE RECIPE. GOD HELP US.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />These krinkle sticks are the best baked low fat snack EVER. NO QUESTION. They have a great crunch and a HUGE SERVING SIZE!!!! You would have no idea they are so low in fat! They are seasoned to perfection. Sometimes the seasoning can settle to the bottom a bit and the sticks near the bottom are seasoned more (MORE FLAVOR NOM NOM NOM NOM). They are baked, not oily, but still taste awesome.<br /><br />You HAVE to try these. I prefer the regular sea salt flavor.

review/summary: A true carb-craving life saver!
review/text: In my never ending quest for lo-cal yet tasty snacks, I happened on these potato sticks at Fresh Market. The fact that a serving is a whopping 40 sticks for 110 calories and (wait for this) a mere 20 calories of fat intrigued me. I figured the sticks would be mini-sticks....but NO! They're a generous size and, better yet, are crispy and delicious! They're lightly salted with sea salt so you don't feel like you're sacrificing anything! I was quickly addicted. Unfortunately, Fresh Market isn't exactly around the corner, and I could find no other stores in the area that carry them. Amazon to the rescue! The price was better and the speed of delivery is...WOW! They also sell them in individual bags. I highly recommend these snacks for fellow carbaholics!

review/text: When I got these I looked on one of the bags and it was way past the expiration date. They still sort of taste ok but almost every time I order a food product from Amazon it's either past or close to the expiration date so from now on I will not order any food item from Amazon. OK Amazon take note that to keep customers you need to add expiration dates to all food products advertised and let the people decide if they want it or not.

review/text: Started using lard again, and I love this product.  For the poster that said that this product has partially hydrogenated fat, this is a quote from the ConAgra Foods (Armour) company, emailed to a customer who posts on proteinpower.com who inquired about their lard:<br /><br />"Thank you for your email dated 5/1/2008. Armour Lard has .02% fully hydrogenated (zero % moisture) lard flakes added in the lard to make the end product more stable. I hope this answers your question. If you need more information please feel free to call me at (800) 456 1330.<br />David Short<br />Director of Sales<br />Armour Specialty Marketing"<br /><br />Personally, in lieu of fresh rendered pork fat, which I do make and LOVE, using this product is a nice substitute when I don't have the fresh rendered stuff on hand.

review/summary: There's more to lard
review/text: There's more to lard than human food.  I use lard in place of suet in a recipe for bird food.  Birds have a different metabolism than humans and they thrive in a high-fat diet.  This is an ideal product to provide them with a little food, and my recipe is wildly popular with a variety of birds.  It never gets rancid, and will only melt above 95 degrees which is seldom found in my central California neighborhood.  Therefore I feed every month of the year.

Internet lard.  FORTY EIGHT pounds of it, in fact.  And you're going to have it shipped to your door?  I mean, hey, it's none of my business, but maybe you should switch to a leaner diet or something, at least until we get the public health care thing sorted out.  Still, it's pretty darned fine lard, I must say, so if you really must have 48 pounds of lard, I guess this is as good of a choice as any.

review/summary: Healthy dog food
review/text: The Holistic dog food from Bench and Field is my dog's favorite. The ingredients are excellent and I can pronounce all of them! There is good meat content and grains are kept to a minimum. There are a couple of fillers in there that I could do without, but, as far as fillers go, they are less objectionable ones.<br /><br />The kibbles are small, great for small dogs and toy breeds like my Tibetan Spaniel. I learned about this food because they carry it at Trader Joe's. More reviews at my dog blog, BadDogBaxter.com.

review/summary: Healthy Dog, Softest Fur
review/text: This is the only food my dog has eaten all her life.  She's a pug/terrier mix.  She's now 5 human years old.  We have a special plan with her vet so she visits the vet every six months for comprehensive exams.  She's never been sick.  She has soft, shinny fur and nonstop energy.  People are always shocked at how soft her fur is when they pet her.  Her only issue is dental problems but that's our fault.  Have to practice brushing those teeth (when we were more vigilant she had better dental).  Anyway, I've never tried any other dog food but considering for 5 years my dog has remained in the same healthy condition with this brand.  I don't plan to change.  I normally buy this at Trader Joes but I'll try ordering it from Amazon now that I found it here.

review/summary: Picture Does Not Show Product
review/text: Why post a picture of items you are not selling?  I get very frustrated with sellers who use a stock photo of general items instead of the actual items they are selling.  It isn't difficult to take a picture of the actual item - or search for a stock photo of the actual item you are selling.<br /><br />What is even *more* frustrating is that they don't bother to list the flavors you are buying since the photo is not accurate.<br /><br />The picture shows six different flavors of Activate.  I actually thought I was receiving all six since Activate has many more than six flavors.  I thought THAT is what "variety" meant.  I received three bottles each of four different flavors.  Are they relying on their legal disclaimer to diffuse their laziness?  "Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented..."  Even so, that does not say the PRODUCT is different than the picture.<br /><br />I bought this product because I saw the Exotic Berry flavor at Wal-mart.  Tried it, and thought it was pretty good.  But I don't live near a Wal-mart and have not seen it elsewhere.<br /><br />I rate Amazon's employee who posted this item with one star since I don't see another way to rate the seller right now.  If I easily find a way of rating the seller, I will change my star-rating here.<br /><br />The Exotic Berry flavor is fine.  It is the only flavor I have had.  The other flavors shipped in the box are Lemon-Lime, Orange, and Fruit Punch.  Had I known that Blueberry and Pear were not included, I would have purchased a different package from Amazon - one where the employee bothered to find the right stock photo of the item being sold.

review/summary: Spanish Saffron Threads
review/text: Saffron lasts a long time and you only need a small amount to flavor most recipes. While it seems expensive, it goes a long way and is not expensive in the long term. This glass bottle of saffron is perfect and will last for what seems like years. I have tried a few varieties over the years and this saffron seems to last a long time and is always flavorful.<br /><br />I use Kashmir and Spanish saffron in many of my dishes, but for bread, I prefer the Spanish Saffron threads. Many recipes call for saffron powder, but using the threads in this recipe is much more effective and the flavor seeps out into the warmed milk. You can also use saffron threads in cream soups to give them a more delicious almost buttery flavor.<br /><br />The purple saffron crocuses must be picked at dawn and then the three red threads must be stripped from each flower. It takes about one hour to strip 1,000 crocus flowers. Saffron can cost thousands of dollars per pound and must be harvested from about 70,000 flowers.<br /><br />Here is my favorite recipe for using these honey-like, intoxicating saffron threads.<br /><br />Saffron Rolls<br /><br />3/4 c. fat-free milk, warmed to 110 degrees<br /><br />8 saffron threads<br /><br />1 pkg. rapid-rise active dry yeast<br /><br />1/4 c. clover honey<br /><br />2 lg. eggs<br /><br />2 T. canola oil<br /><br />1 1/4 tsp. salt<br /><br />4 c. all-purpose flour<br /><br />Oil for bowl<br /><br />This dough may be made in a bread machine or by hand. Bread machine method: After heating the milk, steep saffron for 10 minutes. Strain milk into the bread machine pan along with yeast, honey, eggs, oil, salt and flour. Set on sweet, dough, large cycle. When complete form rolls.<br /><br />Hand method: After heating milk, steep the saffron for 10 minutes. Strain milk into a large bowl. Add yeast and honey. Beat in eggs, oil and salt. Stir in enough flour to make a soft dough, then turn out onto a floured board. Knead until the dough is smooth and elastic. Set in an oiled bowl, turn once to coat with oil.<br /><br />Turn oven on to 200 degrees. When you can feel the heat on your hand, turn the oven off. Cover dough and let rise until double, about 1 hour. Punch dough down and cut into 12 pieces. Form rolls by turning each piece of dough inside out to form smooth rolls. Place on a baking sheet. Brush rolls with melted butter and set back in the warm oven until the rolls have doubled or for about 45 minutes.<br /><br />Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven 25 minutes. Serve with butter and jam. Makes 12 rolls.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
