review/text: PB2 is ground up peanuts.  It has a lot less fat and calories than jarred peanut butter.  And the taste is amazing.  I can't eat organic peanut butter.  This is so much better.  I've also used it to make a peanut sauce in a recipe and it was amazing.  We are hooked!

review/text: I absolutely love PB2!  I'm not really fond of it as a peanut butter replacement in a sandwich, but it is wonderful when used as a mix-in for peanut butter flavor.  My favorite ways to use it is mixed into oatmeal, low-fat vanilla ice cream, pancakes, protein shakes or greek yogurt.

review/summary: Interesting and tasty
review/text: So, I have to admit I was initially skeptical of powder and water making peanut butter, but this stuff is pretty good! It's my first try, so I will have to perfect measurements - so far I'm thinking I might try closer to a 1:1 ratio instead of 2:1...it will help the product to go further too. It tastes good and smells even better - very pure and peanutty, plus, I am always happy to save calories, especially on higher fat foods like nut spreads. I imagine it would travel well in small containers. Of course, on the downside, it's quite bit more expensive than good old Jif...

review/summary: What a wonderful surprise for PB lovers!
review/text: I was excited to try PB2 after reading so many rave reviews.  Now that I've tried it, I wholeheartedly concur. This really is an amazing product.  It's easy to prepare and it tastes fantastic!  I love to cook.  Anything and everything.  But I've been looking for new ways to curb calories without losing flavor and the joy of the food.  Initially when I bought this, my goal was to make a lower calorie satay sauce without losing that wonderful peanut flavor. Now that I've tasted PB2, I'm sure it will make a great peanut sauce.  Plus I can imagine making lower calorie cookies and PB&Js and who knows what else?  If you're experimenting in the kitchen like I am (a la Bobby Deen reworking Paul Deen), consider giving this a try.

review/text: I received an assorted gift pack of Stacy's chips, simply because my name was "Stacy".  Little did I know this was the start of an addiction.  The other chips were great - but these cinnamon sugar pita chips are absolutely out of this world!  I am now on the hunt for how to get some more - but Amazon is out of the large 12 count package.

review/text: I never dreamed I would be driving all over town, just hitting stores that I know carry Stacy's Pita Chips, looking for the display cases that have the Cinnamon Sugar 6-Ounce Bags so that I can take them ALL!  But I am!<br />  I first had them about a month ago, just by chance.  I only learned to buy them on Amazon recently, but with the savings I'll get here, it means more to add to my reserve supply, thank God.  I liked some of the other Pita choices - but that was only until I tried the Cinnamon Sugar.  Being a bit of a sugarholic, this would be my preference - but Oh, the delight of crunching a light snap with just the right amount of cinnamon.  Then to find even that surpassed with loving the very bottom of the small broken pieces in the bottom of the bag that taste very close to perfect, with excess sugar running around loose to add something extra.<br />  I  don't want to tell you what stores I found all my goodies in - I know you will just want to go take them from me.  :-(

review/text: These are really good.  I love sweet things (more so than salty) and these are a perfect treat.  They are not too sugary.  They are a little greasier than I would prefer and thick (I like to break them into smaller pieces).  I would like it a little lower fat and a little more fiber.  Anyways good luck not finishing a whole bag in one sitting.  They are that addicting.

review/summary: Stacy's Chips + &lt;most people> = empty bag
review/text: Stacy's Cinnamon and Sugar Pita Chips are so good that I think I might need a 12 step program to give them up!  I see that some of the other posters say that they could eat a bag a day -- Ha!  I could eat a bag of these tasty little morsels at every meal, wipe my face with the bag and hope I could sneak a few more for dessert.<br /><br />One negative reviewer said that these chips are dry.  Of course they're dry!  It's called crispy, and Stacy's chips have crispness in abundance.  You open the bag and the delicate scent of cinnamon and of baked goods, exactly as if you had just opened the door to your favorite bakery. Breathe deep -- this is your bag of chips, and why not enjoy it?  Look in the bag and see those golden brown triangles of crisp-baked pita, generously covered with good cinnamon and sugar.  Offer a chip to the other people in the room, after all you have to be polite.  Be secretly glad that no one here knows how good they are, so you won't have to share - this time.<br /><br />Now you can take one of those perfect triangles and either bite it daintily or just pop it in your mouth. (Here's where it gets a little hazy)  You're going to have a few minutes of incredible flavor and texture, just like Mama used to make, if she made "crust cookies," pie crust generously sprinkled with Cinnamon and Sugar, and baked to a flaky crispness. Take another bite and enjoy.  Let all those memories drift over you...<br /><br />And then you have an empty bag!  how could that be?  I had a full bag not two minutes before.  It must be some kind of universal time warp that occurs whenever I have a bag of Stacy's Chips.  I open the bag, lift a chip to my mouth and suddenly, the bag is empty, I want more, although I fear that eating three or more bags of these snacks a day would leave me the size of the Hindenburg.  Ah well, tomorrow is another day.  Hmmm - I may have gotten by that "one-a-day" rule.  Eat your normal bag of chips in the afternoon, then wait until after dinner.  Grab a bag of chips when you sit down with the family after dinner.  If anyone notices or says anything, say "I wanted to have a bag with lunch, but I (forgot to grab them, the Quickie-mart was out, whatever excuse suits your fancy)<br /><br />Devour your second bag, and say that you want to watch a little bit of late night television after everyone else has retired for the night.  See all the misery and tragedy that news people love to send over the airwaves to keep you from having sweet dreams.  Now you have to do something to take your mind off the problems of the world. How about a little (tiny, really) bag of wonderfulness?  yep, it's after midnight, a new day, and time for your first bag of Stacy's to lull you off to sleep.  Best of all, no one knows about it!<br /><br />All of this is dependent upon Amazon and their wonderful delivery program which delivers these amazing treats at a very reasonable price.  Here in my area, the price that Amazon asks is less than half the cost at the Supermarket!  I can eat twice as many for the same price!  Whoo-Hoo!<br /><br />All kidding aside, these are wholesome, tasty snacks that aren't fried and can add a real punch of flavor to a low calorie diet.  They are delicious, economical and have none of the grease that you feel and taste in fried chips. Amazon sells them for a terrific price, and they arrive at your home amazingly fresh and without one broken chip.  (Your chip breakage may vary)<br /><br />If this hasn't given you a reason to try these tasty little morsel of paradise, then I can't help you.

review/summary: MMMMM.....GOOOOOOD....VERY, VERY GOOD
review/text: I had someone purchase several bags of different flavors (including naked, which has no flavor) and tried all but the Cinnamon Sugar chips. I liked them all, but LOVED the Cinnamon Sugar! Actually, I decided to experiment, so I opened a jar of natural raw almond butter and spread it atop of one chip and to my amazement it was FANTASTIC! I am going to try my luck and this time either try it with apricot/peach preserves/jam....maybe with a little cream cheese.....hmmmm. Anyway, the almond butter tasted great with this, imo. It is also very tasty as is. The only reason I give it 4 stars (wish there was a half-star option....I really would give it 4.5 stars) is because I do not like broken chips and this bag was predominately broken chips.

review/text: These things are hard to describe except to say that I'm hooked.  Yummy, not a heavy snack.  They make a great snack anytime.  I like to have them with iced tea or some other light beverage and they make a great pair.  They are slightly sweet but not overmuch.  Something totally different and like I said, somebody stop me please!  Thats the only problem, if you have no self-control they are so light and tasty you can eat a ton.  I have to remind myself: everything in moderation.  Then I'll be okay!  But they will satisfy your sweet tooth without having to eat a bag full of donuts!  And that can't be bad can it?  Just to tell you how different they are, I got a couple of bags on special at the local drug store.  When they were gone I went back and I guess they were just a special item because they didn't have anymore.  So I knew I'd try to look around and find some somewhere and then happy day I saw them on Amazon.com.  Now I don't usually go looking for things so thats my clue.  If they are good enough to track down they are GOOD ENOUGH!

review/summary: Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips
review/text: I have been battling colon cancer for two years and, most recently, pneumonia.  In the process of having three surgeries, chemo and radiation treatments I, of course, lost my taste buds and couldn't find anything that really tasted good to me.  Having lost thirty pounds that I couldn't afford to lose, I desperately searched for something that tasted good to me.  Then I discovered Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Baked Pita Chips!  How delicious they are!!!!<br /><br />I have gained ten pounds and could eat three bags of these chips per day except I can't afford them.  No only are they hard to find at stores in the Charlotte, NC area, they are really expensive.  Harris Teeter grocery stores stock them but they charge $3.49 per bag and Bi-Lo grocery stores charge $3.99 per bag.  With so few chips in a large bag, that is really too high.<br /><br />My last order for Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar chips through Amazon was for 24 of the small bags which really doesn't last me long.  By the time I add in shipping and handling for my order, I really don't save any money.  Being retired with a fixed income and incurring so many recent medical bills, I find it hard to afford to buy the chips.<br /><br />My recommendation to Stacy's Pita Chips Company would be to add more chips to the bag and also lower the retail price.  It would be great to have the chips available in discound stores, such as Wal-Mart, etc., in order to purchase them at a cheaper price.<br /><br />Stacy's should give me a free year's supply of the Cinnamon Sugar chips because I have told other cancer patients, a lot of friends and family about the chips and seem to have everybody "hooked" on them.

The left over pie crust would be arranged on a baking sheet and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  Of course, this was a decadent treat, but one that I adored and always made me feel good.  I love these pita chips and encourage anyone who has not tried them to do so, especially if you like cinnamon.  This is a great snack and definitely would be great if paired with coffee or tea, though I lean on hot tea a bit more than coffee.  Try it; I do not think you will regret it.  My husband and daughter love them too! Thank you Stacy's and Thank you Amazon!

review/summary: A good alternative to chips
review/text: My husband really likes to have chips or something to munch on in his lunch, and pita chips are a good alternative to regular potato chips.  I decided to buy these at Amazon.com because they are such a better price than I could find them in stores. An added bonus was that Stacy's brand is our favorite in terms of taste (compared to Trader Joe's and other store brands) but they are normally more expensive per bag, so it was nice to find them on sale.  However, I will note that I bought these as part of a promo (one of those save $$ off a purchase) so I don't know if they will be as good of a deal in the future.<br /><br />The only downside of ordering these (and other items from Amazon grocery) is that since they come in bulk, you end up with a lot of the product at a time.  I ended up with 24 bags of Pita chips total, which was a lot to find room to store!

review/text: The cinnamon sugar pita chips are delicious! I wanted something crunchy without all the salt. I found these by accident. You know how grocers put products on the ends of the aisles...I picked one up and was hunting for them the next time I went grocery shopping. Now I'll just have amazon deliver them. How convenient!

review/text: I have dental problems, so my enjoyment of normal crunchy things isn't what it used to be.<br />I can't eat popcorn anymore, for example.<br /><br />That being said, I had to say that I LOVE these Bugles!<br />They dissolve fairly easily, so I would guess they are easy to chew too.<br /><br />The taste? Great! The closest I can come is like caramel corn without the hulls!<br />A little sweet, a little salt (our bag was not overly salty like another reviewer had mentioned),<br />and a lot of very tasty!<br /><br />I didn't even look at the ingredients or calorie count on this one, because quite frankly,<br />there are times that I just don't care. This is one of them.<br />Of course, don't eat anything like this every day, but when you can't decide between sweet or salty,<br />this will fill the void!<br /><br />Great job Bugles - this one is a keeper!

review/text: I ordered these cherries for a backpacking trip I was taking and wanted lightweight but highly nutritious food to take with me.  I knew that a lot of people in my circle use tart cherries in one form or another for different reasons.  I was mainly interested in the ammino acids for muscle recovery and the natural energy they would provide.  They were everything I had excepted, my friends on the trip loved them as well and are now sold on the idea of tart cherries and their overall health benefits.

review/text: As a Bzz Agent, I received a few of Lawry's products to try for free.  I was out of ideas for dinner one night and remembered the marinades from Lawry's!  I placed chicken breasts in a bag and added the marinade.  30 minutes in the refrigerator (which I thought was too short, but the bottle claimed it would work) and then into the oven.  Easy...that is what I like!  The house smelled wonderful and the kids came down asking what smelled so yummy!  Upon eating the chicken, the whole family agreed that this was a keeper!  It was flavorful, but not overpowering and not overly salty (like other marinades I have tried).  I give this product a full five stars and will definitely be purchasing this in the future!

review/summary: Could be Better
review/text: It's delightful to see so many mainstream companies trying to improve the nutritional value of their products.  With this Veggie Pasta Macaroni and Cheese, Kraft has made a nice attempt in that direction with a product that has a very high kid-favored status.<br /><br />The veggies in question are in the pasta itself, which is made of a combination of grain and cauliflower.  It is tasty, indistinguishable from the standard wheat pasta product, and cooks up nicely al dente.  I truly enjoyed it and hope to find more of this pasta (alone) on the shelves.  It is far less tough than the more common tomato and spinach pastas.<br /><br />But that's where the goodness pauses while the powdered cheese sauce mix--still the original formula as far as I could tell--jumps in and loads the meal with sodium.  According to the package, it delivers a whopping 550 mg (23% of the adult daily requirement for someone on a 2000 calorie diet).  That jumps higher (28%) if the product is prepared with the added butter or margarine (I used an olive oil-based spread for just a bit of additional nutrition) and 2% reduced-fat milk (I used 1%, which did not affect the quality of the cheese sauce at all).  The calorie-count is still good at 370 for a full serving, which is half the box and about right for an adult if a salad or some other vegetable is served alongside.  I also added canned water-packed tuna to fill it out a bit so two adults would be satisfied.<br /><br />I'm sure Kraft could lower the sodium content without making the meal less palatable to the children it's really aimed at feeding.  If they do that, then this will become an excellent addition to the pantry shelf.  There's no denying that the flavor is great and the texture is exactly right, with the cheese sauce remaining slightly liquid without turning pasty as it sits on the plate.  Overall, it's a good start, and it certainly would be an improvement in the diets of families used to the regular Mac-and-Cheese products.

They all noticed that it tasted slightly different than the regular Kraft Mac and cheese.  The pasta has a slight sweet taste to it. Two of the kids still liked the veggie version, one did not.<br /><br />So, what makes this Veggie Mac-n-cheese? Well, according the the ingredient list, the pasta contains dried cauliflower along with the normal wheat.  Apparently there is enough dried cauliflower to make 1/2 serving of veggies per 1 cup of pasta.<br /><br />Is there any other difference nutrition wise?<br /><br />Calories per serving:  Veggie M&C 370  Regular M&C 400<br />Calories from fat:  Veggie 140  Regular 170<br />Sodium %:  Veggie 28%  Regular 30%<br />Fiber grams:  Veggie  3g  Regular 1g<br />Sugar grams:  Veggie 7g  Regular 6 g<br />Vitamin c %  Veggie 15%  Regular 0%<br />Iron %:  Veggie 15%  Regular 10%<br /><br />The amount of  calcium and Vitamin A were the same for both products.<br /><br />So, while macaroni and cheese out of the box is not the most nutritious food product in the world, Kraft Vegi version is a healthier option.

I didn't really notice any difference in the taste of this new product from the original, which is what Kraft advertises. It is very cheesy and if there are vegetables inside, I suppose it offers a sense that you eating healthier. Of course, adding milk and butter doesn't help much. Nutrition-wise, it contains fewer calories, fat, and sodium per serving.

review/summary: same calories, more vitamins, similar taste
review/text: Firstly, I have to say I was a bit disappointed that this has the same calorie count as their regular macaroni and cheese- just a warning!  However, it does have some increased vitamin content.  I can taste a small difference- sort of like if you cook with spinach fettuccini or another lightly flavored pasta.  however, my picky 5 year old (who won't eat hardly any vegetables) liked it!  A good way to hide some vegies into him.  Also, i use the light preparation method- it is possible that if you put in the full amount of butter and milk you wouldn't notice the difference in pasta flavor at all.  The texture is great- just like the usual macaroni.  A yummy product!

review/text: This looks like the same macaroni and cheese you've been eatig for years, but now there are veggies hidden in the noodles.  I didn't taste a difference and I served it to my family without telling them.  I have four kids between the ages of 2 and 8 and the three who usualy eat mac and cheese ate this up without comment.  Even my husband, who can sometimes be as picky as a kid, didn't notice a difference.  We've been eating the whole grain version and the noodles in those boxes come out a bit firmer.  But even the texture change was pretty subtle.  As I said, none of my family could tell.<br /><br />On the other hand, I couldn't really give it five stars because the neon cheese is still neon cheese.  I stir in about a half a cup of shredded cheese whenever I make it and that really improves the cheese flavor, in my opinion.

review/text: I LOVE the original Kraft Mac & Cheese, so I was willing to give this a try.  I have to say it's a disappointment, and definitely misleading.  First off, it's a smaller box with only 2 servings instead of three, and it costs more.  The calories are comparable between the two.  Second, the "veggie" aspect is dried cauliflower added to the noodles and you only get a half serving of veggies in the full serving of mac & cheese. Even if you have a child that absolutelty hates veggies and won't eat them, you can get a full serving of veggies in Chef Boyardee that has more flavor and is filling.  Last, though the original and veggie are supposed to taste the same, they don't.  The veggie isn't bad, per se, but it just isn't as flavorful or "cheesy."<br /><br />Overall, I agree with most of the mid-level reviews here; this wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as the regular Kraft Mac & Cheese and the helf serving of veggies isn't worth the reduced flavor.

review/summary: Uh-It's Mac-n-Cheese
review/text: It's a different box, but the ingredients look, smell and taste the same so what's the big deal.  It seems to me that all this is, is the same old product in a new box.  OK, new and improved(?) box. But the inside seems exactly the same and the preparation and taste are the same.  It's sad to think that some one in R&D at Kraft said, "hey, let's add the word Veggie or Vegetarian or Vegan to that old standby Mac-N-Cheese and see how many people we can fool into thinking that it's a new product".  So I'm cynical...can you blame me.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz

review/text: This is the same old Kraft Mac & Cheese that we all know and love. Easy preparation and very tasty. I prefer Velveeta because it is real cheese and not powdered. This was ok, I don't think I will buy it for my family. This mac & cheese has a full serving of veggies made into the pasta. This is a good way to get kids to get their serving of veggies in the form of mac & cheese.3/5 stars.

review/summary: tastes good, but...
review/text: Although the boxes are the same size, the new Veggie Pasta from Kraft provides fewer servings than the original.  The Veggie Pasta is 5.5oz while the original is 7.25oz which makes the new, healthier version significantly more expensive.  So while Veggie Pasta tastes just as good while providing more nutrition, I'll keep buying the original version unless there's a good sale on the new one.  Because honestly, the extra nutritional value just isn't enough to make up for the price difference.  Based on the "as packaged" numbers, Veggie Pasta has slightly less cholesterol and sodium than the original:  10mg versus 15mg and 550mg versus 580mg, respectively.  Veggie Pasta also has 15% Vitamin C (a big improvement over the none in the original), an additional 5% in iron, and 2g more dietary fiber.

review/summary: Disappointing Taste and Nutrition
review/text: You look at the box and you think -- a way to sneak in more veggies that no one will notice. As good as that might sound, you have to look deeper at this box and the product inside.<br /><br />I prepared this for my family and I was immediately confused by the nutritional list on the box.  Now a non-veggie pasta from Kraft Mac & Cheese has three servings, this listed only two but to be blunt it easily fed three people.  It also listed only one half serving of vegetables per serving in the box so frankly with one box feeding three of us, it was basically adding no vegetable value at all.<br /><br />The taste was basically tasteless. We expect a certain cheesiness from Kraft and this just failed utterly.  It was salty but not cheesy.  The only creaminess was from the milk and butter I added along with some spice when it proved so bland.<br /><br />I could take a nice tomato and/or spinach pasta and add my own cheese mix to get a product that was tastier and healthier.  My family would eat it and be better pleased as well.  No one liked it in my household.

review/summary: Quick fix
review/text: Kraft Blue Box Macaroni and Cheese Vegi Original, advertised as 'vegie' pasta, is your average boxed macaroni and cheese, satisfying for those in need of a sudden answer for mac/cheese but not, of course, up to the standards of home-baked, thick and cheesy oven mac & cheese. It does have a distinct vegie taste, but is not overpowering or offensive. I did add shredded cheese to the mix when it was cooked as I like a more substantial, thicker mac & cheese. A purist will not be satisfied with this, but if time is an issue and you want at least a facsimile of mac & cheese, this does answer enough, at least as a snack.

review/summary: Trick Your Kids
review/text: Kraft Mac & Cheese Vegi is much like the original; so much so that it could be an effective ruse to get the kids to unwittingly have an extra helping of cauliflower.<br /><br />After having some for lunch today, we all agreed that the difference in flavor is nominal. The noodle size seems to be smaller, although it's been a very long time since my wife and I had any mac & cheese at all, so maybe it had changed by now anyway. I do taste the vegi-powder in the mix, but a kid probably would not.<br /><br />Mac & Cheese is never on our menu for a host of reasons (enriched flour being the principal concern), but for the majority of American families, this product would be fine - possibly even a better choice than the original Kraft Mac & Cheese.

review/summary: It's mac n cheese...
review/text: The regular elbow shells of kraft mac n cheese have never been my favorite (everyone knows shapes is where it's at!) These veggie noodles are made of cauliflower apparently, and I prefer their flavor! They are less artificial tasting but just as starchy. The cheese left something to be desired, but we ended up adding bacon and it made it DELICIOUS (not surprising; bacon makes everything better). Overall, it isn't too different from the original macaroni. I would buy it again, but for the most part I'll probably stick to shapes for now!

review/text: I could smell the green vegetable flavor while cooking the macaroni but after adding the cheese packet, butter, milk and a sprinkle of cheddar you couldnt tell it was in there at all. The flavor was the same as the regular but the texture was slightly off. My kids ate it but it bothered me that my dog wouldnt touch it. She always gets the leftover Kraft mac & cheese but this she just smelled. I wouldnt buy this again. I much prefer using the regular mac and cheese and adding veggies to the water while cooking such as broccoli, carrots or peppers.

review/summary: Extra Money Same Taste
review/text: Pros:<br />Three times as much fiber as original Mac'n'cheese (3g v 1g / serving)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Costs more than twice as much per serving as original.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Just buy the normal mac and cheese and get your fiber elsewhere.  Nutrition content per serving is nearly identical (as boxed), and as prepared they tell you to use half as much margarine in the vegi mac and cheese vs the normal, so don't compare the "as prepared" nutrition content as you can easily cut the butter down with the normal and still retain great taste.  The normal box is 3 servings with 4T butter, this box is 2 servings with 2T butter, so cut the normal down to 3T and you should be fairly similar.<br /><br />Taste wise I notice very little difference between the two, this veggie mac might have a slight vegi aftertaste, but nothing too offensive.  If the price per serving were closer together I would recommend this mac and cheese.  The difference in taste is nothing as strong as whole wheat vs white flour breads.<br /><br />The bottom line is this doesn't really have any significant quantity of vegetables in it, the first ingredient is enriched cauliflower pasta product, but what this means is that it is enriched wheat flour with some dried cauliflower mixed in.

review/summary: It Is What It Is
review/text: There are basically two ways to look at Kraft Mac and Cheese Veggie Pasta.  You can compare to to regular Mac and Cheese - it's healthier!  Or you can compare it to stuff in the produce aisle - it's processed crap disguised as health food!  Both approaches are valid.<br /><br />The cheddar cheese powder tastes great as always, and the new veggie noodles taste the same but smell slightly off.  The box helpfully informs you on the back that one serving of this stuff provides 1/10th of your recommended daily helping of veggies, but uses up 1/4th of your allowance of saturated fat and sodium and about 1/5th of your allowance of calories.  Actually, it doesn't tell you that in so many words, but that's what you'll find if you read between the lines.  Delicious yes, health food no.<br /><br />In the end this is just a gimmick product to charge more for.  For some reason the price of Kraft 50% Whole Wheat Mac and Cheese remains about double the price of regular Mac and Cheese, and it looks like Veggie Pasta will hold to that strategy too.<br /><br />My advice: stock up on regular old Kraft Mac and Cheese when it goes on sale, toss out the noodles and use the cheddar powder with store-brand 100% whole grain macaroni noodles.  Eat a couple carrots while the water boils, and you'll come out ahead on both price and nutrition.

review/summary: For veggies, this isn't too bad
review/text: I took a chance on this because I like to try healthy options whenever possible and I LOVE Kraft mac and cheese. I was a bit hesitant when it said it was "veggie pasta" because I was confused as to how this product was going to give me servings of veggies in my mac and cheese. But Kraft has pulled it off!!<br /><br />First of all, you have to remember that whenever there are veggies in something, it's not going to taste as good as the really fatty foods that we all love. So I started by cutting the product some slack and not having high expectations. With my first few bites, I couldn't tell the difference at all! The cheese wasn't as cheesy as the original but that's ok. Halfway through my portion, I started to notice some hints of broccolli and cauliflour. It wasn't that noticeable and it might just be because I KNEW that there had to be veggies in there somewhere. When I was making the pasta, it smelt like I was steaming veggies and I was a bit hesitant because it didn't smell all that great. But I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted it. I still prefer the original with all his fatty cheesy goodness. However, if this is the only way that you can get veggies into your kids...then go for it!!

review/summary: Not memorable
review/text: There is something about "sneaking" vegetables into people that irks me a bit.  If the goal is to eat a healthy diet that includes a variety of foods, this is not likely to ease the transition and merely reinforces in the minds of adults and children that processed food is really very good for us.  If it absolutely the best that you are willing or able to provide, it serves some purpose.  There was no discernible foreign flavor to the finished product although the boiling pasta gave off a distinct broccoli-laden aroma.  As far as flavor, this does not seem to be as cheesy as the regular version so for kids deeply familiar with the original, it may take a bit of convincing.  If boxed meals are standard for your family, choose the ones that offer the largest amount of disguised nutrition, knowing that it can in no way be compared to the flavor or health benefits of the real thing.

review/summary: Get your veggies a different way
review/text: One of my favorite comfort foods is Kraft macaroni and cheese. Now there is a way to enjoy one of my favorite meals and still get my daily servings of vegetables. Kraft Blue box now makes a macaroni and cheese with 1/2 serving of vegetables per cup. So I can enjoy my mac and cheese and still get my veggies. I wasn't sure how I would like a pasta made with veggies, but this dish would never have you guessing there were any veggies hidden inside. The taste was as good, if not better, than the original Blue Box mac and cheese made by Kraft that I have enjoyed for many years. It was so creamy and tasty, I wanted to eat the whole box! I made it using the Light prep method substituting unsalted butter and fat free milk for margarine and 2% milk. This didnt in any way take away from the taste.I think this is  prefect for kids that love macaroni and cheese but hate to eat their vegetables, but also great for us adults that love our childhood favorites. Now I can eat my mac and cheese and not feel guilty!

review/text: I wasn't quite sure what this was when I got it.  It turns out it's basically normal Kraft Macaroni & Cheese (the powdered kind) with cauliflower mixed in to the noodles.<br /><br />Does that actually make it healthier?  I have no idea, but it does have more fiber than the normal kind, if I'm remembering right.<br /><br />Physically the noodles look the same as normal.  The taste?  I *THINK* I actually taste just a tiny bit of the cauliflower, although honestly I'm not 100% sure I'd notice if I hadn't read the ingredient list.  I don't think it tastes 100% like the normal variety though.<br /><br />If you've had normal Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, you know what to expect here.  It's not going to compare with home made, but it's not bad, and pretty low calorie too (even with the full amount of butter you add).

review/summary: It's Unanimous - Not Good!  Not much healthier either.
review/text: First thing to note is this box is smaller than the normal kraft mac & cheese (5.5 oz vs 7.25 oz).  So you get 2 "servings" instead of 3 according to the boxes.<br /><br />As far as the veggie part...the pasta has some "enriched cauliflower" (whatever that means).<br /><br />It has more fat, cholesterol, and sugar than the regular mac & cheese.  The only true benefit (according to the box) was the vitamin C difference.<br /><br />I decided to have a taste test with the family for dinner tonight.  I cooked a box of regular mac & cheese and a box of these...they did not know which was which.  Everyone agreed that the regular one was better.  Everyone also correctly guessed which one was the new one.  Side-by-side there is definitely a difference in taste.  In fact, the veggie pasta does have a distinct taste of cauliflower in these.<br /><br />In conclusion, the slight nutritional benefit is not worth the inferior taste and servings.

review/text: The instructions on how to prepare this box of macaroni and cheese are basically the same as the regular Kraft mac and cheese - so it's very easy. And of course it's great that vegetables are included in the pasta, making it a bit more healthy than the regular. The texture of the noodles was slightly mushier, so I'd recommend undercooking them a bit if you want them to be more like the regular noodles. I also thought the sauce seemed more bland, not sure why that was. Since I only rarely each box macaroni and cheese, and since I did like this veggie-containing alternative a bit less, I'd probably just rather stick to the regular Kraft mac and cheese.

review/summary: Tastes good, easy to digest, but not a good value (yet)
review/text: I agree with another reviewer who pointed out the higher cost per ounce for this product.  It's a good option and I'd still be willing to pay a little more, but not to the point of having to buy three boxes where I would have bought two just to get the same quantity of end product. Packaging it as a stealthily undersized box is not going to help consumer reception.  I didn't compare the ounces on the box at the store and just picked up the same 2 boxes I usually get.  The result was ending up with a disappointingly small quantity in the pot after expending the same effort as with regular mac and cheese.  I thought, "this is going to go over like a lead balloon for most people."<br /><br />It does taste a little 'healthier', and I find that a plus, not a minus.  My husband and I both found it yummy and light, and easy on the stomach.  I would gladly switch to it completely if they can find a way to bring the price down.  When I cook mac and cheese I add frozen peas, canned salmon with lemon and tarragon (plus a little 2% shredded cheddar) to make it a fancier and healthier easy supper, and the vegi pasta makes it even healthier.<br /><br />Until they can improve the pricing/sizing issues, I'll do what others have said and just keep an eye out for it on sale.

I have a son who is absolutely opposed to anything with vegetables in it including the Chef Boyardee because it has a tomato on the can he noticed one day and stopped eating it.  (Yes he is very picky).  So I thought I would try out the mac and cheese (which thankfully Kraft was smart and did not put any veggies on the box.)  He ate it right up and said he loved it.  Yay, score one for mom!!!  I will definitely be buying it again, but will be happy once the price goes down a little bit because it is spendy.

review/summary: Great taste BUT...
review/text: The Kraft Vegi Mac and Cheese tastes great to me and my family. It has more nutrition than the original Kraft Mac and Cheese as well. Based on the box the vegi pasta has less sodium and cholesterol than the average mac and cheese. It also has more Vitamin C, iron, and dietary fiber than the average mac and cheese. So you get an item that tastes great and that is very nutritional so it wins in my book.<br /><br />With that being said the original Kraft Macaroni and Cheese comes in a 7.7 oz box and this Vegi comes in a 5.5 oz box. This is a huge difference in size if you are feeding and entire family on it. This is also more expensive than the original Kraft mac and cheese.<br /><br />For me and my family nutritional value is huge so I would rather pay a little more and get a little less so this is why I give it 5 stars. However, if nutritional value isn't as important than it would be better to stick with the cheaper original Kraft mac and cheese.

review/text: I hate cauliflower. HATE IT.<br /><br />However, this doesn't taste like caulifower. It just tastes like Kraft Mac & Cheese. It's good. It's yummy. It may not be all that much more healthy, but it's a neat trick and I think it's probably better than eating more wheat flour in my diet.<br /><br />It's easy to make, tastes good, and it's affordable. I'd still suggest eating some real vegetables as a side dish, but every little bit helps, eh?<br /><br />I recommend it. Give it a shot... Even if you hate cauliflower.

review/summary: Love it, but veggies have to outweigh the taste tradeoff for you
review/text: Ok, it's NOT the same taste as the original, so if taste is your only factor, don't bother with this.  However, the taste is pretty good, and the good feeling of getting some veggie nutrition might tip the scales for you.<br /><br />Me- I'd rather eat the real stuff and a find a way to keep a few pieces of broccoli down.  But like you'd imagine, this is a great option for those kids who just won't touch their veggies, and you're not ready for a 4-hour ordeal that ends with an exhausted kid asleep at the table and an exhausted parent looking at mac-n-cheese reviews to keep his/her sanity...

review/summary: good,but something's obviously missing
review/text: i bet your average kid wouldn't notice, but when i tried this kmc i could tell that a slight something was off with the sauce or noodles. it just wasn't like the og kmc--taste seemed...lackluster?hell, go for it to try to get your fam eating healthier, but they may notice the difference too. you could mix it half&half with regular kmc though, and it would likely be a better taste.

review/summary: The health part is a gimmick; the food isn't bad
review/text: The Kraft mac & cheese Veggie Pasta seems more like a marketing ploy than a serious effort at nutrition (think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMOCPI">Fruit Roll-Ups</a>, which are "made with real fruit" but have hardly any nutritional value).  There's a slight bump in fiber and vitamin c, but nothing truly noteworthy.  Perhaps because the true veggie worth is "about" (their word, not mine) 1/2 serving of vegetables per 1 cup serving of mac & cheese.<br /><br />That said, the taste change is not starkly different from the original.  I usually make my mac & cheese with some broccoli, tomatoes, or other veggies anyway so this can be a good supplement.  I don't think the drop in quantity from the regular blue box (5.5oz v 7.25oz, or 2 servings v 3 servings) is worth the "health" tradeoff, and it seems most likely a marketing justification to sell you less for more (hey, it's a rough economy for Kraft, too, especially with corn and flour prices rising).<br /><br />Overall it seems a wash to me.  If you are desperate to sneak in any amount of veggies then buy this.  Otherwise, price being equal, I'd recommend the regular mac & cheese, with its extra serving, and just add a few veggies of your own.

review/summary: Kids Love It
review/text: I served this to my five and seven year old sons, both of whom love mac and cheese. They loved it and didn't notice that it was any different from regular mac and cheese. The vegetable used is cauliflower which doesn't have a strong flavor and is easily masked by the cheese sauce. I know that processed mac and cheese is not the healthiest dinner choice but if you're going to serve it anyway I would assume this version has slightly more nutrients. However, I didn't compare the nutritional label to regular mac and cheese so I don't know that for sure.

review/summary: Just o.k. with a bit of a bland taste - and actually not so bueno on the health!
review/text: While my family is not major fans of mac and cheese I always keep a couple boxes of the stuff around for food emergencies and/or teen groups. In general we prefer the Kraft brand to other brands or generic but honestly I sometimes mix in a box of generic or two. Times are tough.<br /><br />We found this one to be very bland. For the amount of sodium, fat, and calories I expected far better. The veggie parts are not significant enough once you hit those fat and calorie levels to justify it. We didn't hate the taste - but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it either. Its probably a bit healthier than regular M&C but that's not really saying much. Overall - I'd buy it on sale but would not go out of my way otherwise - and if the sale included the regular M&C I'd buy that instead. It's not quite at the "take a pass people" level but it's not far off either.

review/summary: Tastes just the same
review/text: I eat Kraft Macaroni & Cheese a couple times a year -- sort of a throwback to my youth when the neighbor lady across the street described it as "good food that sticks to your ribs."  In later years, another friend would refer to Mac & Cheese out of the box as "plastic macaroni & cheese," which I understand too.<br /><br />Still, Kraft is the granddaddy of them all and so I was amused to try one where the pasta is infused with "real vegetables."  I shudder to think that people would believe that you're somehow getting the benefit of eating real vegetables that are now infused in the pasta.  How could that be?  Well, it can't.  You file that under "processed food" at its worst and keep going.  But, no one eats Mac & Cheese out of the familiar blue box and expects anything nuanced in flavor or texture or particularly healthy, for that matter.  That's not what this does.  So, in the context of what this is -- it's great.  In the context of making your own Mac & Cheese with al dente pasta, sharp cheddar blended with a couple of other cheeses -- or even Stouffer's frozen Mac & Cheese -- well, the Kraft variety cannot and does not ever compare.<br /><br />But, you all know that going in, right?  You know what you're getting when you spend the $1.29 or whatever you paid for the box and you prepare it at home with your own milk and butter.  It is what it is...and has been since I was a kid.<br /><br />So, enjoy.  This new variety will not disappoint; it's exactly what it's always been and what you'd expect it to be!

review/summary: Totally worthwhile substitute for the normal Kraft blue box
review/text: I'm a mac'n'cheese fiend.  I love all kinds of mac'n'cheese from the powdered cheese-product variety to the real deal made with cream and endless cups of cheddar.  So, trust me when I say that you won't be able to TASTE the difference between this Vegi version of the Kraft mac and cheese and the standard original boxed Kraft mac and cheese.<br /><br />The only thing I noticed was that when I was cooking the pasta, my kitchen smelled as if I were cooking broccoli - so if you're trying to hide the fact that you're sneaking in vegetable servings from your picky kids (or in my case, husband) be sure that you keep them out of the kitchen as the pasta is cooking. The final product was totally tasty and there was no noticeable difference in texture or taste from the original.

review/summary: For those who really can't stand the sight of vegetables
review/text: Kraft Mac & Cheese Vegi original tastes like cauliflower.  You can't see it, but it's there.  And it's delicious.  But then, I like vegetables.  In fact, if I was searching for something good to eat, I would probably cook a box of macaroni alongside a pot of ACTUAL vegetables.  I would certainly get more nutrients that way.<br /><br />It seems as if this product is being marketed toward people who don't get enough vegetables in their diet, and therefore need them to be inserted into something they already eat.  Kind of like V8 Splash.  It's good for you, but it doesn't LOOK like it is! Score!!<br /><br />Yet, Vegi Original still tastes very much like vegetables, so unless the SIGHT of veggies is the only thing that offends you, you're not going to be able to get past the cauliflowery taste.<br /><br />Let's face it, Kraft Mac & Cheese (any kind) is delicious, but unless you prepare it with half the butter and non-fat milk, it's really not very good for you.  Even if there IS "1/2 a serving" of cauliflower thrown in.  You'd be better off just eating your darn vegetables straight up.<br /><br />But hey, Kraft enthusiasts, give it a try.  You might like it more than the original!  I found them to be pretty equal.  Yum.

review/summary: Tastes different to me, and less is not more!
review/text: When I was younger, I loved Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, easily eating an entire box myself for dinner. As I've matured, I'm now a home made mac&cheese kinda guy, but the Kraft flavor is still appealing (kind of like a Macdonald's double cheeseburger - not really a hamburger, but still quite munchable!). That said, this is not what I want when I eat Kraft Mac&Cheese - ~2-oz less stuff? Hrumph! Also, though childless, I agree with other reviewers that describing this as a method to get veg into your kid is stupid. I much preferred the, "If you don't eat those vegetables you don't get dessert!" method when I was a kid. It worked for me.

review/summary: Would not buy this
review/text: There is really no added nutritional benefit to this product and to call it "veggie pasta" is seriously stretching the limits of credibility.  I get it: kids love Kraft mac & cheese.  Here's I used to "sneak" veggies in to mac & cheese: at the last minute, I poured a handful of green peas in to the macaroni.  Was it hidden? Of course not, but my kids grew up thinking that was how Kraft mac & cheese was.  It was only the occasional visiting neighbor kid who ever protested.

review/summary: Not a healthy alternative
review/text: Any additional health value gained from the vegetables added to this product is countered by a high sodium (550 mg) and high calorie cound (370 calories).  It's prepackaged food so you don't exactly expect it to be healthy, but if you are going to market your product as healthy then you should be taken to task for it when it is not.  Insofar as other health benefits, it includes 15% USDA recommended amount of Vitamin A and C, but your kids are probably already getting that and then some from their morning breakfast cereal.<br /><br />It tasted fine and was easy to prepare, which is what you expect from pre-packaged food.  It is what it is, a quick side dish for when you are in a hurry.  But a healthy way to sneak veggies into the family's meals?  Not so much.

review/summary: Well-Hidden Veggies
review/text: I tried this box of macaroni out on an unassuming guest, and they said it just tasted like regular macaroni to them. Being a bit more discerning, knowing that I was getting cauliflower flour ground in with my macaroni, I found myself scrutinizing a bit more. I think there was a faint bitter taste that I could detect, but it was perhaps only there because I was looking for it. This is definitely a healthier alternative to that kids wouldn't object to if you've got pickier eaters. There didn't seem to be a discernible difference in texture, taste, or looks.

review/summary: Mediocre Marketing Gimmick
review/text: I'm not a believer in "sneaking vegetables past the children," especially when the veg in question is in the form of pasta. While there may technically be cauliflower in it, it has none of the health benefits of eating actual cauliflower. There is also less in a package than original mac and cheese, and only two servings rather than three. Even if the cost per package is the same, that makes this product more expensive per serving.<br /><br />Cooking the very thin pasta for the six minutes directed on the package resulted in pasta well past the al dente stage. I used butter rather than margarine in the preparation but otherwise made as directed with no added ingredients. We got two decent sized servings from the box. The resulting mixture was just o.k. For me, the pasta had no texture and little taste, only a mild cheese flavor. Mrs. Boilermate said she could taste the veg in the pasta and said she thought it was a "good addition." She thought it was less creamy than "Easy Mac" or the regular variety. She said Stouffers Mac and Cheese was better, and I agree with her.<br /><br />Overall there's not enough here for me to like enough to purchase this product. You get less per package than the regular variety in exchange for a "veggie benefit" that's a bit over-hyped. And, if Mrs. B. is to believed, one that doesn't taste as good.

review/summary: Same taste; small bonus
review/text: I'll keep it simple: I couldn't taste any difference between Kraft's "Veggie Pasta" Mac & Cheese and their regular Mac & Cheese. It's yummy, not as rich (or calorie/fat-laden) as homemade, and reminiscent of many people's dinner-or-lunch-at-home-when-parents-are-out and/or college days. The fact that this new option contains "1/2 serving of vegetables per cup*" is good... I guess. I do, however, find this addition of "vegetables" a bit unsettling. It's great that kids (and adults) are getting "extra" vegetables, but I've got a few questions:<br /><br />* How exactly are these vegetables incorporated into the Mac & Cheese?  Are they powdered? Mushed and blended? Does the process that incorporates them into the M&C completely (or mostly) destroy the vegetables' nutritional value???<br /><br />* Does the addition of these vegetables - and marketing/pushing of said addition - mean that parents are going to stop worrying so much about making their kids eat actual vegetables, since they figure they're getting "something" in their Mac & Cheese? (This scares me) Similarly, is this going to undermine the process of "assisting" kids in developing a taste for actual vegetables?<br /><br />I fear the answer to these questions is not great, and for those reasons, if the price of the new "veggies added" M&C was the same as the regular version (or only a few cents higher), I'd probably buy it (both for my nephews and myself). As soon as I placed it in my cart, however, I'd pretend that it wasn't "veggie-tabulous" and still make sure that they (and I) had a FULL serving of a green vegetable on their (my) plate, alongside the yummy, bright-as-a-safety-cone Mac & Cheese.

review/summary: Good, Not Great
review/text: This was very edible and tasted good, but I felt like I was missing out. I've just had much better you know?<br /><br />To me, this Mac & Cheese seemed to fake. Maybe I'm just used to eating organic Mac & Cheese, but I don't know what to say other than, it kinda grossed me out.<br /><br />I would buy this in the store if it were the only option, but I'd honestly like to stick to 100% pure organic versions as they always taste more real, less processed.
