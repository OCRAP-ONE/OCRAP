review/summary: PEPPERIDGE FARM COOKIES-SOFT BAKED CAPTIVA(PACK OF 5)
review/text: An astonishingly delicious soft baked chocolate brownie cookie by Pepperidge Farm, at a great price of only 13.00 for 5 packages that normally go for $3.49 each through Amazon.com seeing it rarely if never goes on sale at the supermarket unlike Pepperidge Farm's Milano Brand Line of cookies and their Goldfish Crackers all of the time. Great purchase at the right price when available! ENJOY!!!

review/summary: BROKEN COOKIES, BAD PACKAGING
review/text: These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, "Don't call here anymore."

review/summary: Throw Into Montauk's Waters
review/text: This is the only kind of Pepperidge Farm cookies that I have had in my lifetime that are just terrible. Very strange...the chips are great, but the cookie part of, well, these cookies, has a nondescript, bland, processed/white-sugar taste. No, you cannot compare the taste to a sugar cookie- it's like an alien's version of a chocolate-chip cookie hastily made in order to use to lure a human to its/his/her spacecraft. The brown sugar is just not kickin' here, so just kick these to the curb.

review/text: Started ordering these yummy, rich chocolate cookies a few months ago.As most chocolate lovers know,it's not worth it to eat poor quality chocolate. These are filled with dark chocolate bits and are soft and creamy in the mouth.Actually they are so good that eating "just one" is truly satisfying.

review/summary: PEPPERIDGE FARM SOFT BAKED SANTA CRUZ OATMEAL RAISIN COOKIE(PACK OF 4)
review/text: Another delicious selection in the Pepperidge Farm family of Cookies called Santa Cruz Oatmeal Raisin. I picked up my order for a great bargain through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for only $7.49!!! When you consider that these normally cost you listed on bag @ $3.49/per, and generally never go on sale at the supermarket/grocery store unlike the Milano Brand line of cookies by Pepperidge Farm the price was right to quote the famous game show still on T.V. today. Get yours today and ENJOY!!!

review/summary: PEPPERIDGE FARM COOKIES, Mmmmmmmm
review/text: What can be said negative about Pepperidge Farm Cookies.....ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! These soft baked, milk chocolate variety from Pepperidge Farm comes with 8 deliciously decadent cookies per package with a total of 5 packages per order and is mouth watering for any cookie or chocolate lover period! To boot, since this type of variety of Pepperidge Farm Cookies NEVER goes on sale at the supermarket or grocery store(at least where I live) unlike Milano and their Goldfish Brands, it would cost you $3.49 per bag X5, for a total of $16.95. Except I pick these up all the time through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon.com for anywhere between my most recent purchase for 5 bags @ $11.04-$11.82 in the past, so you can't go wrong! If the Warehouse Deals(when available) or straight Amazon have a listing available at a higher price then mentioned in this review, then BE PATIENT and rest assure that the price will come down and you'll snag a great bargain like I do all the time on a regular basis. Having some now, Mmmmm!

review/summary: I'm addicted
review/text: I love Pepperidge farm Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies. They make the perfect snack. While other cookies are hard and dry with the texture of sawdust these cookies taste great, and are soft like they've just come out of the oven.<br /><br />Downsides? Each cookie is 130 calories which is a lot for such a small cookie. Also these contain interesterified fats/oils which are chemically altered oils. Not really great for humans to consume.<br /><br />The result? I think I'll bake my own... Without the chemicals. It would probably be safer. 5 star taste. 2 star ingredients. Rating, Average.

review/summary: Very disappointed - won't make the mistake again...
review/text: I've been buying the Art of Appreciation gift baskets for years for my family members. The recipients were always grateful and seemed to have enjoyed the varieties. This year, I got curious and ordered myself a basket after sending several of the same out to my family and friends. Upon receipt, I was shocked at the content and the presentation of the basket especially for the price paid. I could probably come up with a much better mix with less than $30 - in fact I will do so from now on.  I feel embarrassed that this is the type of baskets I've been sending out year after year to my loved ones. Don't be fooled that you'd impress anyone with the included caviar - it tastes like salty but unsweet flying fish eggs. As a person used to the Caspian caviars and even some cheaper American Paddlefish alternatives, I find it insulting and again very embarrassed to have sent the product as gifts. I should've known better... I called my sister (yearly happy recipient) and asked her if this is how it had been for years, and she giggled sheepishly and that's all I needed to know.<br /><br />Received contents:<br /><br />4 pieces (1.2 oz) of Belgian Truffles<br />3.5 oz Dill Salmon Spread (Alaska Smokehouse)<br />3.75 oz Pasteurized Cheddar Cheese (Northwood Cheese Co)<br />0.95 Oz Mochaccino mix - enough for ONE 6oz cup<br />2 oz Smoked Almonds (Los Olivos)<br />2 oz Wine & Cheese Biscuits (Los Olivos)<br />1.8 oz Chocolate Dipped (Truffle?) cookies<br />4 oz Tuscan Crackers (Focaccia Crisps)<br />2 oz Water Crackers (Three Pepper Blend)<br />4.4 oz Wafer rolls (Tiramisu flavor)<br />5 oz Pretzels (typical salted dried)<br />4.4 oz Angelina's Sweet Butter Cookies<br />2 oz green olives, pimento stuffed (Mille Lacs Foods)<br />2 oz Black Capelin caviar (Season brand)<br /><br />Missing Items:<br />2 Pakages Cafe Comfrorts White Chocolate Cocoa Mix<br />Sesame Crackers<br />Merlot Wine Cheese - or is this for the pasteurized cheddar flavored dip?<br />Stone Ground Mustard<br />Ms. Pinables Caramel Confections

Opened a chilled can, drained it - and mixed the fish along with it's nutritious soft bones & skin with a little mayo and half a squeezed lemon.  It is the most incredible taste and because the Salmon is wild, has the health benefits one expects, but rarely finds, in our foods today.  I am thrilled to have at least one outstandingly healthy product!

review/summary: Much Better Than Tuna
review/text: I like it much much better than tuna. I've had it in salads, hot dishes, straight out of the can and I love it (for canned salmon recipes see the company's website). I don't mind the skin and bones at all because you can't taste them, but when I'm preparing it for others I just mash the skin and bones with a fork, leaving the bigger chunks of meat intact, and nobody has ever noticed them. The delivery is always quick. I also appreciate the recipes and the postcards with the message from Pre Alaska Salmon Co included in the package. It feels good to always have a few cans of Think Pink tuna in my pantry.

review/text: I was hoping that it would be an alternative for canned tuna, but it isn't.  The can was full of skin and bones (and salmon meat).  It was like they threw the whole fish in a shredder and then canned it.  They didn't even remove the backbone.  After trying for a while to remove the bones and skin, I just gave up and threw it out.  Maybe I got a bad can?  If not, you guys need to open a can of tuna and compare product.

review/summary: Very good if you like the texture
review/text: This sausage is covered in a sort of edible mold-like substance similar to brie cheese.  It's a part of the curing process and imparts a delicious flavor to the sausage.  In addition, this is a very well-dried sopressata--which I like.  However, the texture isn't all that good.  There are hard things in it which don't seem like meat--tough, almost like little pieces of leather.  If the texture was good, I'd give this delicious sausage five stars--but because the texture is a turn-off for me, it only rates a three in my book.  If you don't mind little touch hard chunks in your sausage, and love a rich, complex flavor, you'll probably love Molinari's sopressata.

review/text: New to brown rice syrup. Used NOW brand in hot mint tea (with raw honey) and liked it very much. Decided to venture out & found this. Tastes very different than the NOW brand. It's richer and turns the tea cloudy, tastes and looks as if a splash of milk was added to the tea. NOW brand left the tea clear.<br /><br />I prefer the NOW brand in hot tea but prefer this for baking, cooking and as a topping (sweet potato, krispy treats, popcorn, greek yogurt, etc.)  It has a more complex and buttery background which is better suited to such applications.<br /><br />DELICIOUS.

review/summary: The best damn chicken spice out there...
review/text: As an avid cook and spice mix experimenter, my hat is off to Chef Tom and his 'Spice Girls' for creating a world-class chicken spice.  This is one tangy and flavorful mix that blows the doors off anything similar one could find at a supermarket.  Primary notes are paprika and brown sugar, but what my nose smells first is ancho chile and star anise.<br /><br />This mix creates a light crust on the food and colors it brilliantly red.  Surprisingly, it's also very good on the 'heavier', red-fleshed fish like salmon.  Highly recommended along with Chef Tom's other standout product, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a>.

review/summary: Didn't strike a chord with my palate
review/text: Background: Roasted chicken is something my wife and I often eat on Sundays and we like to try different things from time to time.  I tried this seasoning on a brined whole roasted chicken with a liberal application of the rub.<br /><br />First the objective facts.  Here is the ingredient list in order: Brown sugar, smoked paprika, salt, ancho, black pepper, turmeric, coriander, garlic, cinnamon, star anise.<br /><br />Now my subjective opinion also shared by my wife.  I was completely underwhelmed by this seasoning.  It has a very different flavor profile from most rubs but it didn't impart much saltiness or spiciness. The cinnamon and star anise seem to take center stage here and it just came across as odd and unbalanced to me. Maybe I just really love a lot of saltiness in a piece of perfectly roasted chicken skin, but this didn't give it to me.  I would prefer a simple roasted chicken seasoned with salt and black pepper to this rub.  For that reason, I won't be using the rest of my rub but I'll put the container to good use storing extra nuts and bolts in my garage.  I hope the salmon rub I also bought is better.

review/summary: Healthy and great tasting!
review/text: This review is less about the cereal and more about the option of buying from Amazon for one of two reasons:<br /><br />1) If you've never had it, you're probably not going to buy a 4-pack.  More likely, you'll go to your local market and buy one box.<br /><br />2) If you have had it and you're looking at this item, you're trying to decide if you want to buy a 4-pack.<br /><br />I have a 4-pack delivered every month via "Subscribe & Save" and here's why:<br /><br />My local groceries carry the smaller 12oz boxes for about $3-$3.50, the 16.7 oz box is usually about $5-$5.50.  Bear in mind, this item is a 4-pack of 16.7 oz boxes.<br /><br />The subscribe & save option from Amazon takes 15% off (did I also mention no shipping, no commitment) which lowers the $20 price tag to more like $17 for four boxes, or $4.25 per box- that's almost a dollar off what my grocery charges!<br /><br />So, I get the cereal I love, delivered to my door regularly and automatically, for almost a dollar less than what I'd have to pay if I drove to the store.  It doesn't take a college education to know that's a deal!

review/summary: Great way to help parents on fixed income
review/text: My mother lives in Colorado and is on a very fixed low income. If I send her money she won't use it so I have found I can help her by buying her groceries off Amazon and having them sent directly to her house and this enables me to be able to help her. THANK YOU Amazon for having products like this on your site. I hope you continue to work with companies and make this affordable to have groceries shipped this way and also to save us the hassels of going to the grocery store when we can have it delivered to our house for about the same cost as going to the grocery store.

review/summary: I Lost 6 pounds in 2 weeks!
review/text: I was just two pounds shy of my Weight Watchers goal when I fell off the weight loss wagon and gained four additional pounds.  Life was busy, and I wanted a fuss-free way to lose those last pounds before swimsuit season.  Since I enjoy Special K products, I thought I'd put the Special K 2-Week Weight Loss Challenge to the test.  I ate Special K cereal for two meals, snacked on fruits and veggies (instead of the recommend Special K snack products) and made healthy dinner choices.  I didn't expect to lose 6 pounds as advertised, since my weight loss had slowed from months of dieting and I was near my goal weight.  To my surprise, I lost 6 pounds and have finally reached my goal weight!<br /><br />ABOUT THE DIET:<br /><br />It's convenient and doesn't require much planning.  However, it could get a little boring in the long run.  It could also be difficult to meet daily nutritional requirements.  Also, rapid weight loss could be difficult to maintain in the long run.  If you've been dieting and just can't lose those last few pounds, or if you need to lose a few pounds fast for a big event, give Special K a try.<br /><br />ABOUT THE CEREAL:<br /><br />One can usually find a box of Special K in my kitchen cabinet.  Most often, it is the Red Berries variety.  I enjoy the Fruit and Yogurt flavor, as well, but the serving size is 1/4 cup less.  The original flavor is also nice from time to time, but the Chocolatey Delight is just not a good idea, in my opinion.  But back to the Red Berries.  The cereal consists of the usual Special K flakes with dehydrated strawberries.  Once I pour on my Silk Light soy milk, the berries plump up to add lots of real strawberry flavor.  There are generous amounts of berries and the flakes stay crispy in milk.  All in all, this is an excellent cereal that I highly recommend.

review/summary: The Pros and Cons
review/text: Kellogg's Special K Cereal, Red Berries, 16.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4), is a delicious cereal.  Since Kellogg is number one  -- the number one producer of convenience food in the world --we know Kellogg will give us what we want while ignoring the things that do not matter to us.<br /><br />What do we want?<br />(1) Flavor.  Those real freeze dried strawberries are so delicious that we are tempted to eat them dry out of the box and leave the cereal.  The cereal tastes good too.  It is sweet, and there is malt flavoring that we love.<br />(2) Nutrition.  With 110 calories per cup, we can measure out a cup and use it for diet food.  It has vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, B vitamins, and minerals.<br />(3) Grain.  There are crispy rice and wheat flakes.<br /><br />What does not matter to us? (Or does it?)<br />(1) Sugar.  The cereal is loaded with it, but if we did not have it in the cereal, many of us would spoon in a generous application. The second ingredient is sugar.  Is that cane or corn?  Also listed in the ingredients is high fructose corn syrup.<br />(2) Nutrition.  It is hard to stop with one cup full because we are used to feeling full.  A cup of light cereal takes us through the motion of eating slowly . . . that's a plus . . . but does not satisfy the way whole grain cereal does.  About the added nutrition:  some of us don't need all of what it gives us, or maybe we really do prefer to take them in pill form so we know we exactly what we are getting.  Many of us take in more iron than is considered healthy for our specific needs.  What your physician will tell you about this issue may be surprising.<br />(3) Grain. If we are allergic to wheat, we need to pay attention to the label.  Also there is corn in the form of fructose.  What we are getting is highly refined grain products when whole grain would be better for our health by providing fiber.<br /><br />With the price out of the range of what we usually spend on breakfast foods, I don't find it a good value.

review/summary: GREAT CEREAL
review/text: While I understand people getting upset over the price increase, the low rate is to reflect the quality of the product not the cost increase by Amazon or their vendors. I actually use the subscribe option  to save money but cancel or put on hold after a few days, I never leave any order to be sent automaticatedly since I will risk the chance of having to pay more, we need to be responsible buyers. Amazon is a business and knows that they will make money on those not paying attention, PEOPLE that is what life had become so get over and on with it. I do prefer the 3 boxes since 4 was to much for us and still buy it when it goes down in price.

review/summary: My favorite breakfast cereal ...
review/text: This stuff is wonderful if you're on Weight Watchers:  a 1-cup serving is only 2 pts, Add 2/3 C skim milk, and we're talking a total of 3 pts for a very filling and delicious breakfast.  I've tried most of the Special K flavors, and this one is by far the best.  The freeze-dried strawberries have a wonderful almost-fresh strawberry flavor, too.<br /><br />Most of my diet (I'd say 90%) is unprocessed, consisting of meals I make "from scratch," using fresh ingredients from the produce and meat/fish aisles.  I also make my own breads, biscuits, etc.  I'm very much aware of the controversy surrounding high fructose corn syrup, the negative impact it can have especially on dieters, and I try to avoid it.  That said, and given my overall diet, I don't have a problem with consuming a small amount of HFCS occasionally for breakfast.  It would be lovely if Kelloggs didn't use HFCS, but they do -- it's fairly low on the list of ingredients (just ahead of salt), but it's there.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I'm losing weight, keeping it off, and I feel great.  If you're concerned about HFCS, you may decide this isn't for you.

review/summary: Good price (w/ S&S); crunchy flakes&low fat. 16.7oz is all cereal & f.dried strwberries. But a little too sweet...
review/text: Guys: Although this doesn't pack the vitamin/mineral punch that Total has, this is a tasty, low fat cereal at a good price. Although it IS a processed food (processed rice, added sugar etc.), I like that it's not just  strawberry "flavored" bits or heavy yogurty-covered raisins and such.......it's real freeze-dried strawberries (ok, they're not fresh, but that's not a problem for me...I LOVE dried fruit in my cereal).  It's also a convenient way to get real strawberry taste in my cereal and it stays fresh.  It's one of my go to cereals out there. The only negative is that it's a tiny bit too sweet for me (it looks like they spray a very light sugar coating on the flakes, not like frosted flakes, but still not needed for my taste).<br /><br />It may not beat the sale price of boxed cereal at Costco or a discount supermarket outside NYC, but compared to typical boxed cereal prices in NYC, $3.39 per 16.7 oz box is a very good price (most brand cereal in a non-discount supermarkets here cost about $5.99/box, and they are rarely above 14 oz per box).

review/summary: Great tasting but there's a reason for it!
review/text: This is a delicious cereal.  The flakes are crunchy and sweet (does not taste overly sugarly) and the freeze-dried strawberries are a perfect match to the flakes.<br /><br />PROS -<br />1. Tasty<br /><br />CONS -<br />1. As other reviewers have noted, there is a large percentage of sugar and high fructose corn syrup in this cereal.  The fact that is has high fructose corn syrup makes this a 4-star review for me.  I mean, c'mon Kellogg's!?  A product that is considered for dieting containing high fructose corn syrup!?  Oh, well....that's what makes it taste good...<br /><br />TIP ON COST<br />Some reviewers have expressed concerns about the cost of buying it on Amazon.  When buying groceries, one should really look at the unit cost or in this case, cost per ounce.  Many supermarkets will list the cost per ounce somewhere on the price tag that you can use for reference when doing cost comparisons.<br /><br />For this product, Amazon has TWO prices.<br />1. The first price is $20.81 (as of 1/8/10) which equates to $0.31/oz - typical retail price at most grocery stores.  (My local Von's price currently is $0.30/oz.)<br />2. The second price is $17.69 (as of 1/8/10) which equates to $0.27/oz - a more competitive price but not the best price.  You get this price if you do the Subscribe and Save which gives you a 15% discount if you sign up for delivery on regular intervals.  I use Subscribe and Save for many groceries through Amazon because I cannot get a better deal elsewhere.<br /><br />If you can find this cereal less than $0.27/oz elsewhere, definitely nab it!  Especially if you're a coupon fanatic!<br /><br />Overall, the price is not too bad on Amazon especially if you're someone who likes the convenience of having some of your groceries delivered.  If not, find those coupons and wait for the sales at your local grocery store and you'll make out much better!

review/text: When I tried this cereal I was not anticipating how great the strawberries would taste!  They are REAL berries and taste so good I could eat them alone for a snack.  Freeze dried fruit makes a difference and they complement the cereal which is lightly sweetened and stays crunchy in milk.<br />When I am trying to maintain my weight or lose a few pounds this is a pleasurable healthy cereal that I prefer for calorie control and taste.

review/summary: Good Bargain..!!
review/text: I love to eat breakfast and I'm a cereal lover from way back! My kids would rather have oatmeal or granola bars, but give me a good ol' bowl of cereal with milk and I'm good to go! I could eat cereal for every meal and not get tired of it, so I try a lot of different kinds. My latest love fest is with Kellogg's Special K Red Berries cereal.<br /><br />Kellogg's Special K promotes itself as being good for part of a weight loss program. The back of the box says that if you eat a serving of this cereal with skim milk, fruit and coffee that you'll have a meal that has less than 250 calories (although I don't know why you would want to add more fruit when you already have strawberries)! It's also fast free and cholesterol free. That's not why I bought it though. I bought it because it looked good on the box and I love strawberries.<br /><br />Kellogg's Special K Red Berries cereal is made with crunchy rice and wheat flakes and has dried strawberries in it. Yummy - I love strawberries! Never before have I had a cereal with freeze dried fruit in it where the fruit actually tastes real and fresh. When I first saw the shriveled strawberries in my bowl the first time I ate this cereal, I was not eager to put them in my mouth. But then I poured the milk in the bowl and the strawberries actually plumped up and almost looked like I had freshly sliced them! Then I took a big bite and wow, the strawberry taste was awesome! The cereal is just sweet enough to not be like a kid cereal but still enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. And there are a ton of strawberries in the box - enough to where I always get at least one strawberry with every bite of cereal.<br /><br />Now let's move on to the flakes. They are a good size but not so big that they are hard to eat. Some cereals make their flakes too big for my liking but this one is just right. Plus the flakes stay crunchy until the last bite is gone from the bowl, unlike some of the other flakes made by Kellogg's and other brands.<br /><br />So for now, Kellogg's Special K Red Berries is my top choice for cereal every morning ... until I burn myself out on it and then I'll switch to something else for a while!

I am doing the Special K diet and have set up the Subscribe and Save so it comes direct to my door every couple months, which makes sticking with the diet so simple.

review/summary: Found my new "Adult" Cereal
review/text: As a kid I remember my favorites being: fruit loops, lucky charms, kix(only because my mother made me), and golden crisp.  When you get older, those cereals stop tasting as good as they did before.  Hence, all the sugar.<br /><br />I have found my new "Adult" cereal, If you're not diabetic and enjoy strawberries.. You will fall in love!

review/summary: Fantasic Food To Keep Goals
review/text: The packaging for the Special K cereal is fantastic. You get your boxes in a nice tightly sealed plastic bound set. They are in air packaging and in a box that isn't too big nor too small.<br /><br />The Special K is a great cereal to fill the hole and for a snack. With it's limited calories you don't feel like you're depriving yourself, rather than indulging in a really good cereal , a really good food. I sprinkle about a half teaspoon of sugar over it just to cut the tart of the strawberries. It fills you up and is better than a normal corn flake type cereal.

However, if the manufacturer can reduce the sugar content, it will be much more useful for people who cannot or do not want to consume large quantities of sugar.

review/summary: good cereal at great price
review/text: If you're buying bulk cereal, I imagine you've already tried and like cereal. I like it, though I find the berries have a tendency to shift downward so you might want to shake it to redistribute them before you open the box the first time.<br /><br />My local groceries all charge $4-$5/box for this size cereal so the Amazon option is especially nice when you include the subscribe-and-save so you get it in a couple days, at a substantial discount, and save a trip to the store.<br /><br />Since you get 4 individual boxes, the unopened ones last long enough not to get stale so buying in bulk makes sense even for me as a single person.<br /><br />The nutrition is nothing special compared to other sweetened flake cereal so the other reviews talking about it being good for health seem to be reaching quite a bit. Exercise is good for health. This cereal won't hurt, but there are other cereals with more fiber, or you can eat fresh fruits for breakfast instead.

review/text: Like most of you I have been dieting off & on for years.<br />I finally found something that doesn't leave me hungry!<br />I lost 12 pounds in 2 weeks by using this cereal w/ Special K Protein Mix & Mega Tea Green Tea pills. I found this combo better than the "Hollywood Diet" which left me starving.<br />What I do: Cereal in the morning, tea pill with regular water, walk 1 mile (1/2 mile each way regular pace- not brisk) drink regular water, go to my boring desk job sipping Protein Mix water, sensible lunch with water or juice, tea pill with water, sipping Protein Mix water, eat whatever I want for dinner- even take out & dessert once a week. I don't count calories or eat bland foods :) 1 bowl of cereal, 2 Protein Mix packets, 2 Green Tea pills every day. Good luck all.

review/summary: Unacceptable ingredients
review/text: I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason:<br />Kelloggs continues to include GMO (genetically modified organism) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels.  There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption.  Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.  Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers.

review/summary: There are Better Breakfast Options Out There
review/text: I don't dislike Special K, and I don't dislike their Red Berries cereal. You will not however see me purchasing this item for my household again. As far a health-wise, it doesn't win big in my book. It is essentially just processed rice, sugar and wheat with freeze dried strawberries. Just a bunch of empty calories that don't provide much of any nutritional value. Almost all the vitamin and minerals are artificially added. Also they added fiber isolate to boost the fiber value, but realize that studies have started to show that these processed fiber adds don't act in the body like natural fiber. Really the healthiest part is probably the freeze dried strawberries, but in my opinion they taste terrible in comparison to fresh strawberries which would take a total of 1 minute to prep and add to your bowl. I do want to restate that the taste isn't bad, but there are much better tasting cereals out there. In all fairness my normal cereal the I will eat on occasion is Frosted Mini Wheats, but some people my find them to grainy or not sweet enough.

I hope the manufacturers realize how many people discontinued purchasing this great product after educating themselves on the dangers of high fructose corn syrup.

review/text: I don't know exactly how we ended up with a 160-bag box of tea <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XEV9YE">Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea, 160-Count Tea Bags</a>, but I think my first reaction was "well THAT will last us approximately forever." HOWEVER, it instantly became, by far and away, the favorite tea in our household. I just searched for it on Amazon, relieved that we can order another box before those last few bags are gone. True to our ancestral Southern (US) roots, we sometimes drink it iced, but this tea truly shines as a "hot cuppa." The flavor is smooth and full-bodied, and this tea really satisfies where the others don't. If I were a tea connoisseur (or if I could even SPELL connoisseur without spell check) I could probably tell you why this tastes so much better than others, but there are good green teas and there are good black teas and THIS is a really good black tea. A friend of ours gets his Yorkshire Gold from a connection in England, so I am especially relieved to learn I don't have to impose upon someone else's friendship to score another box.

review/summary: My Favorite Black Tea
review/text: Simply the best ever, if you like your tea strong, black, never bitter and in a bag. The longer it sits, the darker it gets. Most mornings, I use one bag to make a very large cup (equal to 2 regular teacups for most folks). A single bag can make 4 cups, or a teapot, if you don't like it as strong. I then microwave to re-heat a cup at a time, or use it to make excellent iced tea.
