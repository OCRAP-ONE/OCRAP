review/summary: Perfect Cinnamon Flavor
review/text: My husband and I discovered Claey's Drops in our local chain drug store, but they only stocked lemon and horehound flavors. I am a big fan of anything cinnamon or minty. I also try to search out candy made in the USA, as I find candy from Mexico and Canada to have a strange, off taste to the sugar.<br /><br />The Claey's Cinnamon Drops are perfect! Not too large, not too sweet, and a true cinnamon flavor. The one pound bag is actually not that large. I plan to buy another bag of a different flavor, plus will buy my husband a bag of lemon flavor as a gift.

And, it's actually not that much more expensive than your average candy bar, try it.

review/summary: Broken hearts
review/text: I purchased this 3 pack of pasta for Valentine's dinner really only wanting one bag.  The instructions on the package indicate 10 minutes of cooking time.  Before I even opened the bag I noticed many broken pieces in all 3 bags I received.  I proceeded to follow the cooking instructions while taking care of more complicated foods as the pasta cooked.  After 10 minutes of cooking many more of the hearts were broken and most of the hearts were not even a distinguishable shape.  The comment from my boyfriend upon his first glance was, "look at all the broken hearts" which was not the vibe I was going for.  Fortunately, we both have a sense of humor so it was something to laugh about but it was disappointing to spend so much money on shaped pasta that didn't keep its shape at all.  Some of this problem could possibly be helped by reducing the cooking time but not all of it.  I'll be using the rest of this overpriced pasta in something more hidden like casseroles, obviously cooking the pasta for a much shorter time.

review/summary: Gluten Free Cinnamon Chex
review/text: Our family eats a lot of Cinnamon Chex because it is gluten free and a few of us suffer<br />from celiac disease.  Many of the special gluten free cereals we can buy in our grocery store<br />or at specialty stores are very expensive (regular cereal itself is too expensive).<br /><br />All the Chex cereals are gluten free, but when we saw the subscription availability for the Cinnamon Chex,<br />it brought the price down to less than $3.00 per box (a pretty good price for cereal).<br />We receive 3 boxes once per month and it is just about the right timing for the amount we use.<br /><br />Very happy with the product, price and availability.

review/text: I don't know if innovation in an already amazing category is possible, but once Chex started their gluten free line, I knew that gluten free diets were main stream and I was happy! These cinnamon chex are perfectly sweet and cinnamon to keep you wanting more. They do tend to get a bit soggy if you dilly dally with your cereal, but that's nothing to keep me from eating the last crumb from the bottom of the bag. I love that I can easily find these at the grocery store, or order them in bulk online for an even greater discount. And to think I had almost given up on enjoying an gluten free breakfast....

review/summary: Should be named "Cinnamon SUGAR Chex" - Too much sugar!  What were they thinking?
review/text: I grew up eating Chex cereals - corn, rice, wheat, bran Chex... sure they had sugar in them, but they weren't ridiculously sweet.  This Cinnamon Chex is.  The description says "...less than 10 grams of sugar per serving!"  I expected that this would be mildly cinnamon/sweet but instead it is VERY sweet.  There is A LOT of sugar in this.  In fact, there is so much sugar in this first box I opened that it's caking up on the squares and there was a good quarter cup of sugar mixed with cinnamon left at the bottom of the bag.  Its like the whole box was doused with a heavy dose of cinnamon and sugar - just too much!  If you eat it as a dry snack, you can feel the sugar granules on your fingers and on your tongue as if you decided to roll some Chex in a bowl of table sugar.  It's not terrible, just way too sweet.  I am very disappointed.  Less than 10 grams of sugar per serving?  Seems impossible.  I wouldn't buy it again.<br /><br />Maybe it was a bad box or bad product run?  I dunno.<br /><br />06-06-2011 Update: 2nd box same sugarfest as the first!<br /><br />06-20-2011 Update: 3rd box same as other two.<br /><br />06-25-2011 Update: 4th box more of the same.  (yeah, I bought 2 packs of 3 for my first (and only) order of this)

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: I used to buy this seasoning mixture at Sam's a couple years ago and then they discontinued it, at least at the stores around here.  I was so glad to see it finally offered on Amazon, at a higher price, but then 21 ounces is a big bottle of the spice that lasts a really long time even if you use it often.  I used it in all kinds of dishes since I like a little fire and spice in my food, but mostly I use it on kidney beans.  I know it sounds weird, but years ago when trying to add more fiber to my diet I discovered that a can of kidney beans with a little vinegar and a few shakes of this seasoning tastes really good.  The calorie content isn't too bad, it's really filling, and you're getting a good dose of fiber.  And best of all, it's really easy and fast if you use canned beans.<br /><br />I like the seasoning because it's just enough heat without being over the top and it has sort of a smokey flavor to it that reminds me of chipotle peppers.  The ingredients are:  Salt, Chili Pepper, and Other Spices, Dehydrated Red Bell Pepper, Dehydrated Onion, Sugar, Dehydrated Garlic, Spice Extractives, and Extractives of Paprika (as color).  It doesn't contain any MSG as far as I can tell from the label (You never know what they hide under other terminology though).  I've tried all kinds of other brands of similar type seasonings and could never find one that's just like this.  I'm hooked.

review/text: I purchased this for a friend who used to get this at a local "warehouse club",but they no longer sell it. He was thrilled that I found this great seasoning. He uses it on steak and grilled chicken. I ,being a vegetarian, use it on grilled potatoes. Here's my recipe: slice potatoes,onions,red &/or green peppers,drizzle with olive oil &/or butter and sprinkle on a fair amount of Tones Chipotle,wrap in a foil packet and grill until tender and golden brown . Amazing !!!

review/summary: THE BOMB!  A Must Have In Your Pantry.
review/text: When Sam's Club quit carrying this spice years ago, I ended up calling Tone's to see where I could buy it.  Luckily, Tone's has a not very well advertised site that allows regular consumers to buy their product. However, over the years, I've noticed that the price on this spice kept going up & up.<br /><br />When I found the spice on Amazon, I was ecstatic.  The price seems to fluctuate on Amazon, but if you track it, you can get find a price point you are comfortable with & get free shipping (thus cheaper than the Tone's site).<br /><br />As for the spice itself:  I LOVE this stuff. I think it is the smokey spice that is added to the mix. We use this spice liberally & go through it quickly.  There is no heat to it, just a wonderful flavor that I cannot describe other than to say YUM.<br /><br />Try it; you'll like it!

review/text: What a great combination of wonderful spices. You can taste the smokey cumin along with chunks of onion and pepper flakes. I use this in our tacos, taco soup and anything that I want a little Chipotle flair. I even add it to my homemade cheddar to give it a Mexican flavor and it is fabulous. Another thing I like is the fact it bursts with flavor without "burning" you mouth. My friend from Mexico sais this is good because true Mexican food is not hot, just very flavorful. If you want heat add peppers. Add this to chicken and you have a great way to change up the meal. I love this product and keep it in my storage so I don't run out.

review/text: I found this seasoning at Sam's Club and now they don't carry it anymore and I can't find it anywhere else....ugh!  I use it in all kinds of foods including meats I do in the crockpot for burritos, tacos, etc. and include it as part of my BBQ rub.  It also goes great in mashed potatos with a generous amount of parmesan cheese!  I think it's not as popular as other spices and seasonings only because it's so hard to find and people aren't aware of it.  I'm sure if more people knew about it and purchased it, it would be easier to find.  If you find it anywhere, I suggest you give it a try because it's a great spice to have on hand for just about anything you would like to have that great southwest taste.  It's way more flavor then heat, so if you can't handle hot, don't worry!  If you like hot, just had some raw jalepeno....lol!  I love this stuff and if I can find it anywhere, will purchase a few jars to keep on hand because I luv it so much and it's so hard to find.  I suggest if you find it, you do the same because once you try it, I'm sure you'll be hooked too :-)

This mixture doesn't look, smell, or taste like chipolte. It tastes and smells like cumin. I tried it on a piece of fish, and the cooked seasoning had no flavor at all. It does have a lot of salt--440 grams of  sodium per teaspoon. Over all, this purchase was a dead loss.

However, these have obviously sat around for a long time somewhere too  warm.  The truffles are entirely coated with that white film that happens when chocolate is stored somewhere too warm.  And the centers which should be soft are instead hard and dried up.  Tastes nothing like the ones you buy fresh in the store.  Horrible.

review/summary: Terribly Wrong
review/text: I strongly suspect this caviar, which is widely available in US supermarkets is a reason for fear of caviar in 90% of American population. This product only resembles real caviar in shape and color (artificial). It would not qualify for caviar in Europe. It's from the wrong fish, it has totally wrong taste, and it also has whole periodic table on the label. It's like dying chicken breast into red color, marinating it in steak souse, and selling it as New York Strip Steak...<br /><br />Real caviar doesn't come from lumpfish, and real caviar only have two ingredients - caviar and salt. Try Red Pearl Salmon Caviar if you want to try caviar. You can easily find it on Amazon and other places online.

review/summary: No Way
review/text: I ordered this product because it was slightly less expensive than the brand that I'd ordered previously. Neither had received rave reviews and I was pleased with the other brand but thought I'd give this a try and save a few bucks, and the packaging looked a bit higher end. WRONG. The other brand (Roland Black Whole Grain Lumpfish Caviar, 2-Ounce (Pack of 4) )is far superior to the Romanoff brand. As other reviews stated, there are many undisclosed additives, and it had a nasty green slimy texture.  Even mixed with egg salad, it had a terrible aftertaste. Ate it about an hour ago and still feel queasy. Spring for the extra five bucks and get the Roland brand if you want an affordable indulgence.<br />Amazon was GREAT about this. They credited me the full value toward my purchase of the Roland, as the Romanoff product isn't returnable since it is a grocery item. Still loving Amazon!

review/summary: Makes GREAT homemade hard tofu
review/text: Arrived as expected and just as it looks and without damage. I immediately made up 2 batches of soy milk in my SoyaJoy (which I dearly love).  Then it was a breeze using this nigari to curdle the soymilk, strain it and put it in my TofuExpress press (which I also dearly love).  In about 2 hours in the fridge I had a super firm block of yummy tofu that has a wonderful texture and flavor I can't get from the store bought stuff.  Makes the best tofu burger in the world. I will never go back to the store brands, even the organic handmade ones.  Also... I just tried a nifty little trick for the tofu burgers today.  Right after I curdle the soy milk and strain it off I stirred in some soy sauce and a big shake of Mrs. Dash original seasoning. Then I pressed the block of tofu. When I fried up the slices for the burgers in a hot skillet with a bit of safflower oil the aroma was great. I put that on homemade whole wheat bread with all the hamburger trimmings and some crunchy dill pickle spears. What an excellent lunch meal!  I will be buying this item again for sure!<br /><br />Also... from what I hear you get some extra Magnesium from this in your tofu which is great for your health. Our diets and modern lifestyle don't supply as much magnesium as we need to be getting and supplements of magnesium don't work like they say they do.  So every little bit you can get is better for you.  Compared to the other coagulators you can use for tofu, this one seems to be the healthiest and most bioavailable form of magnesium.  I heard one guy say that he makes a huge batch of tofu and after straining puts the liquid leftover into a foot massager unit.  He said the heat, massage and soaking in the magnesium salts draws impurities out of your body.  He swears he learned that in Japan and they have been doing it for a long time.  You learn something new every day!

review/text: Rooibos tea has been used for centuries in South Africa.  Not only does it taste really great, it is also good to help induce sleep AND it works to help calm an aching stomach and abdomen.  Whenever me or my kids complain of that good ole *stomach ache*, I immediately brew them a cup.  You can also reuse the Kcup a second time, and even a third though the third will be a little weak, making this a great bargain.  Off topic of the Rooibos, the mint tea can also be used twice in the machine with very little difference in taste.  Both can be used on the largest setting with no loss of taste.  I highly recommend this tea both for it's lovely unique taste AND its medicinal properties.  Enjoy!

I started out with the Bigelow Asian Pear Rooibos and loved it but thought I would take one for the team and try this one too. To my taste, this is less sweet, less woody and more earthly - I prefer the Bigelow but this might be a better choice for black tea drinkers.

review/summary: A Great Tea for a Change of Pace
review/text: Rooibos tea is definitely a departure from the mundane taste of black tea.  It has a much different, though still very pleasant, taste than one might initially expect.  It also has a very unique aroma and serves as an excellent complement to any good meal.  The fact that it is naturally free of caffeine also means that it is great as an evening tea to calm the nerves and avoid the energy rush of caffeine-containing teas that could lead to difficulty getting to sleep.  I must also say that, like other k-cup tea varieties, it is also well balanced and tastes similar to tea prepared in the customary manner.  Overall, this is a very drinkable and, through the use of a k-cup, very convenient tea for seasoned tea drinkers and newcomers alike.

review/text: The African Rooibos tea worked well for the Keurig coffee machine. Some teas tend to taste burnt because the machine makes the water too hot for green or black tea, but this red tea almost always came out nice. It is also pleasant to drink at any time since it is naturally caffeine free. And of course the single serving k-cups with the machine makes the experience so much more convenient than brewing a whole pot of tea for one person.

review/text: Love it. The flavor, hmm.... I do not have the exact words to describe it. I like a strong flavor coffee, and this has a nice strong flavor. I also find green and herbal teas soothing, and the rooibos has that also. It's not coffee, and it's not tea, but it does have some of the characteristics of both. No caffiene, so when I want a coffee late in the afternoon or in the evening, then this is my go to drink.<br /><br />If you're keurig machine has different size options, I usually go with the 10oz size. I found 12oz too weak. I never tried the smaller size options, so I do not know how strong it will be with the smaller sizes.<br /><br />It does stain your cup. But, I once read that if it doesn't stain, then you're not drinking authentic rooibos tea.<br /><br />I will buy again.

review/text: We've been drinking Rooibus tea since discovering it in Africa many years ago.  Now, with a Keurig, I've been ordering all sorts of tea and was pleased when this rooibus was offered.  I thought it would taste o.k. but sort of ho-hum/nothing special.  Well, I was wrong! This tea is an absolute zinger (to borrow the title of another tea). The taste is great and we've been drinking it at every opportunity.

review/summary: Very hard product
review/text: I looked these Halo pumpkin dental chews up on Amazon to see reviews.  I also read the ingredients on them, and found they were wholesome good food products that I would want my dogs eating.<br />  I went by my local animal food store and bought two of these chews for the 25-60Lb size.  One was for my 20lb jack russell who is an avid chewer and the other was for my 40lb aussie/heeler.  Great ingredients.  Since this size has 85 calories a piece, I needed to give only half to the jack.  I gave the jack the half one and the aussie the full one.  Wow, were they hard.  Problem was my jack wanted the whole thing in his mouth while he tried to chew pieces off which he couldn't really.  So I thought uhoh I better get the rest away from him but if he thinks I am coming to take it he will gulp it.  So I distracted him with squirt cheese and took half of the half away.  The aussie promptly gulped the rest of hers fearing I was going after hers too.  So where these were great that they were hard so they actually had to chew on them, maybe not for gulpers.  The dogs seemed very happy with the taste and smell.

review/text: I was quite impressed by these chews!  My dog is allergic to almost everything, so a lot of dental chews are out, but these have very few ingredients that are allergens and my dog just loves them!  The pumpkin one also helps with her digestion (pumpkin always has a way of doing that!)  They are definitely tough to chew, but my 15-pound dog is quite the chewer so she's in heaven!

review/summary: A New Favorite
review/text: I am impressed by Halo's products, although the canned food variety is the only thing I had previously tried, when I was babying my dog while she was recuperating after her spay surgery. I can feel good about feeding her such wholesome food, and she devours it. This was my first time buying Halo treats. Even though the package says they're for dogs 25-60 lbs, my 17 lb, one year old terrier mix is still in the puppy stage and is an avid chewer. I was looking for a product to change it up from the old reliable rawhide, for something she would not demolish in 5 minutes, and something different than meat-flavored treats (for variety). I was unsure if she would go for the pumpkin flavor, but this was an instant hit! She LOVES the taste of these treats and has no problem chewing them. I gave her a whole stick and she worked on it (kept her occupied) for about 45 minutes until it was completely gone. They smell really good, like pumpkin pie spice, and although they are dark brown in color, they do not stain like some of the red-colored rawhide products I've tried. I have gone through half the bag so far (7 sticks in a bag), giving her one every few days, and she really enjoys them. I am definitely buying these again, and I am going to try the mint variety and see if that's a winner too. I'd recommend that even if you have a small dog, give them a try to switch up your choice of hard chew treats if your puppy or dog is a big chewer.

review/summary: Smells great, but.....
review/text: These have great ingredients and smell so good, I wanted to eat it lol. However they are really hard so if your dog isn't a big chewer, like mine, it's not such a good idea. Brownie stopped trying after 30 minutes. So these are going to be donated to the animal shelter. These are for medium to large dogs, not so much for small dogs unless they're really aggressive chewers.

review/summary: Our dog loves these minty chews
review/text: We've tried other Halo products previously and have been happy so we thought we'd give this one a try.<br /><br />We first bought these at our local pet supply store when we ran out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KSQXKO">Paragon toothbrush chews</a> one day.  It turns out that our 15lb pom mix loves Spot's Chews and they smell great to us as well.  The only issue is that it's a lot of chew for a small dog, although they are labeled as being for "small/medium" pets.  They are hard to break so my husband was slicing them into thirds with a knife and we'd give a third of a chew a day.<br /><br />One cute thing is that if you look at them top down, they are actually shaped like hearts.

review/summary: Excellent as wedding favors... but be home when these arrive!
review/text: I used these to fill small boxes as wedding favors.  The wedding favors were beautiful, inexpensive, and delicious!  The price on Amazon was far better than what I could get even at my local [...] wholesale.  I live in Florida and ordered these in AUGUST of all times.  The box sat out on my shady but hot patio from 1 PM until 7 (I didn't realize the package was coming early).  Some of the truffles at the bottom of one box were melted, the other box was fine.  The truffles came in a very large box packed with Styrofoam and gel ice packs, but after several hours in 95 degree heat, some of the truffles were still a little damaged.  I think these are an excellent price, but consider the season in which you plan to order.  If you can't plan to be home in the hot season, this is not your best option.  Out of all 120 truffles total, probably only 10 or 12 were unusable.  Overall, this worked out great for me.<br /><br />PS. I found my favor boxes here: [...]  The small ones for 60 cents each are big enough for two of these Lindor Truffles.
