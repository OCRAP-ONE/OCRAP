review/summary: Single best gluten free product period.
review/text: Pamela's Baking Mix is delicious, versatile, and so good family members who can eat gluten prefer pancakes, waffles, and cakes made with this mix. Try their recipe for sour cream coffee cake for a real treat, and go to their web site for many more recipes. Do not confuse this with their bread mix, which isn't as tasty or versatile.

review/summary: I Forgot How Fun Baking Was...
review/text: I have been pursuing a mainly gluten-free diet for years. While I have tried various products, nothing could replicate the taste and texture of a wheat baked good. I eventually gave up.<br /><br />Until last night.<br /><br />I received Pamela's in the mail, and I decided to make pancakes. For that one experience alone, it was worth the money. The pancakes were just like how Mom used to make 'em when I was a little girl, pre gluten-free days. They were light and fluffy, and cooked up so quickly. AND NO AFTER TASTE!!<br /><br />I also made chocolate chip cookies....incredible, amazing, so moist and chewy and DELICIOUS!!<br /><br />It is as if I woke up last night, and realized that I didn't have to stop baking, that being "gluten-free" would no longer be a chore.<br /><br />I can't wait to attack my Pamela's bread mix this weekend, and resurrect the focaccia bread I used to make in my college days...

review/text: Just had these delivered and decided to make pancakes for diner for our three boys - a 4 yr old and twin 2 yr olds - c'mon who doesn't love breakfast for diner?  The pancakes came out perfect and tasted delicious.  The poor things didn't stand a chance against our boys, I'll also admit to sneaking in a few bites when they weren't looking.  Looking forward to trying all of the other ways to use this product.

review/summary: Great mix!
review/text: This mix performs as it promises, unlike many GF products I have tried.  It is certainly not an all purpose flour, but for a bisquick type sub is great.  The pancakes are light, and if it is your first GF mix you will be surprised at the flavor.  Also, the banana bread recipe is terrific as long as you bake carefully.  We keep this on hand for weekly pancakes and waffles and also for a quick drop biscuit.  If you buy in the 3 bag case it saves money as well.

review/text: This Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix is just wonderful.  Normally I believe pancakes are inferior to other breakfast foods such as waffles, hashbrowns and even cereal, but this particular type of pancake mix is right on the money and tastes delicious.  I strongly recommend it for all pancake lovers and haters!  You won't be hating pancakes after trying this delicious stuff!  If you still desire a hatred towards pancakes after a full belly at the breakfast table you must be completely out of your gourd!

review/text: Don't get me wrong, i LOVE this baking mix for me and my allergy-prone family but i didn't realize for a long time that it does contain buttermilk and almond meal. luckily, nuts don't seem to be one of the foods we are intolerant of, but dairy products are for sure. I just thought it should be put out there. I would reccommend this mix absolutely and will continue to use it b/c i don't think the amount of dairy in it is high. Love you Pamela!

review/text: I made chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter cookies, and brownies with Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix. My husband pined for more brownies. He asked  for more cookies saying "They were really good." He can eat regular food.<br /><br />Me: I am sensitive to the buttermilk solids in this mix, not lactose, but casein. When I eat too much dairy casein, I am irritated to say the least. I do better with a gluten-free diet, so this in moderation for me is fine. I use Pamela's Bread Mix and Flour Blend when I can as it is dairy free.

review/text: We are on a strict Gluten Free diet and won't even use the supposed Gluten-Free junk from the grocery stores that may contain up to 20ppm of gluten.  Pamela's Baking and Pancake flour is great for everything and does not cause us any gluten symptoms at all.  Some of the other GF flours have bean flour that causes severe gastric suffering but not Pamela's, it is the only safe and suitable substitute we've found.

review/summary: These make amazing waffles!!!
review/text: Awhile ago I set out to cut back the gluten in our house. This is one of the products I found to try. It makes the most amazing waffles ever!!! Once we had these waffles, Pamelas became a permanent part of our kitchen. All my kids love them, they have protein from the eggs and are super, super easy. I also use this if a recipe calls for flour, like a gravy, etc. It works great. No one would believe its gluten-free! I will say that its not a 100% health product. Its about half white rice and half brown from what I can tell. So its not a "whole grain" product. We make the waffles about once a week or every other week, as a treat. top with organic jelly or raw honey!

review/text: I have been using Pamela's for almost a year and find that it makes yummy pancakes, waffles, cookies and drop biscuits. I use it as a replacement coating for fried chicken, chicken fried steak and fried zuchinni.<br /><br />The draw back is that it does not make very good gravy. It is thin and watery. Also, I have tried making loaves of bread with it and they always turn out crumbly and the dough does not rise very well, even after doubling the leavening.<br /><br />Hope this helps you.

In fact, we have friends who do not need to follow a gluten-free diet but who use this pancake mix because they think it tastes better than any other pancake mix or pancakes made from scratch.  Yeah, it's that good. Store extra in the freezer, to prolong its shelf life.

review/summary: Wonderful product for a gluten free diet
review/text: I decided to go gluten free for a couple of months to see if it would improve some aspects of my health. I've never liked any of the other gluten free bread mixes, etc, that I had tried before. Things tended to taste funny, egg'y, and had a funny texture. I picked up some of this mix and my view of gluten free baking has been forever changed. Sure, you don't get some of the lovely texture you get with gluten but nothing has been grainy. And it is true that I can't nail the perfect chocolate chip cookie texture with this mix but I've learned to make a variation of that cookie that I prefer with this mix. In short, if you make the recipes that are provided you will be satisfied but if you are creative and have a little experience then you can make this mix shine. I love it!

review/summary: A return to real food
review/text: So, when I started going gluten-free, I was pretty universally disappointed by the gluten-free baked goods I found.  I have done pretty well dining out, but when we go to breakfast diners and I am eating my omelette, I still look longingly at my friends' pancakes.  Well, no more.  This mix means I can have pancakes.  Not "round things which look like pancakes, and if you've been gluten-free for long enough they taste passable and you can learn to kind of like them", but real pancakes that actually taste like pancakes and have the right texture!<br /><br />I use the Subscribe and Save option to have a box mailed to me, and am experimenting with some other recipes as well.  You can't beat the price.  I used to be really depressed about all the things I "couldn't eat".  Not any more.  I can eat anything I want, using this mix to make it at home.  This week's project: chicken and dumplings!

review/text: This is the BEST gluten-free mix I have ever used!!  The pancakes are light and fluffy and don't absorb tons of syrup like regular pancakes do. Even those who normally don't eat gluten-free prefer them to conventional pancakes.  The flavor is really wonderful and the texture is not gritty in any way.  I've also used it in other baking and it works VERY well.  I made a carrot cake with it that was to die for, and I have a pumpkin loaf from the recipe on the back of the bag in the oven as we speak.  A friend that I shared the mix with says she just loves making the drop biscuits.  I recommend this item HIGHLY.  Purchasing the 3-pack of 4 lb bags works for me and is a good price.  I throw the bags in the freezer till I need them.

review/text: I'd been using the ' Stonewall Kitchen Pancake & Waffle Mix ' for a couple of years.  It's quite good, but it had the same problem that I'd found with all other pancake mixes.  If I had pancakes left over and reheated them the next day, they always came out dry.  Then I saw that the reviews for ' Pamela's Baking & Pancake Mix' were great.  I picked up a bag of it at the local Whole Foods.  I was a little leery at first, because the package said that it is gluten and wheat free, but my leeriness was probably due to my lack of experience with this category of products.  As I did with the Stonewall Kitchen mix, I modified the recipe.  I used two eggs, instead of one.  I used butter ( probably about a quarter stick ), instead of oil.  I used milk, instead of water.  To my great pleasure, they not only were quite delicious, but when I reheated the leftovers the next day, THEY WEREN'T DRY!  Now I know why the reviews are so favorable.  My future purchases of this fine product will be from Amazon, because of the great price.

review/summary: Good enough for the rest of the family!
review/text: My wife discovered she was allergic to wheat a few years back, then two of my boys were diagnosed. I have to say that most of the wheat substitute mixes are marginal at best, very gritty and more like survival food. When we tried Pamela's mix it was almost like turning the clock back to the old days when everything my wife cooked was delicious. Let's just say that we can serve pancakes to anybody and nobody turns up their nose. We especially like having the mix set up on automatic delivery from Amazon. If you have a family member that is gluten intolerant, do the rest of the family a favor and try this mix. I only wish there where more products out there this good!

review/summary: An AWESOME Substitute for Breads, Waffles, Etc.
review/text: This was my first purchase of GF stuff.  Well, I couldn't believe how great and versatile it was.  My first experiment was my Banana Nut Bread; I used 2 cups of this mix instead of regular flour but omitted salt and baking soda (it's already in the mix).  The bread tasted great; it did not get that beautiful dome on top b/c it doesn't rise quite like flour...but I was in heaven to have my Banana Bread.  My next experiment was waffles; I dare anyone to pick it out of a line-up.  It tasted just like Bisquick!  It melted in my mouth even without syrup and butter.  I also made bread in the bread machine (using the recipe online that used the Baking Mix instead of the bread mix).  It was good and toasted well.  I do want to try it in the oven so the loaf isn't so square.  I also used this to make homemade Mac & Cheese; I had to mix butter and flour to make the base and used this baking mix...worked great!  I used Heartland GF pasta (this stuff is great and tastes just like real pasta...you can find it online or at Walmart).  I do want to try Pamela's Amazing Bread Mix for bread.  Tonight, we tried  using this Baking Mix for Chicken & Dumplings.  My hubby found that mixing the Baking Mix with milk and microwaving it for about a minute (to make a more solid blob) made for dumplings that don't fall apart in the boiling chicken broth (make the blobs really small though so it cooks well); we cooked the dumplings for about 10 minutes.  My MIL had never cooked GF, but was willing to try it for me and I was happy to eat GF dumplings!  I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Helpful transition to gluten free!
review/text: After my husband was diagnosed with celiac disease 9 months ago, I, as the chef in the house, decided it would be easier to have a gluten free home to avoid cross contamination or accidental ingestion of gluten.  I tried Pamela's baking mix because of the good reviews, the price, and of course the convenience.  I have used this mix in a number of bisquick casserole type recipes without a problem.  We have made many of the recipes on the package and on Pamela's website with great success.  This starting off point has given me the courage to try baking with other flours as well, but there will always be a bag of Pamela's on our shelf!

review/summary: I'm glad I got this!
review/text: I've been recently put on a gluten free diet, which meant that half of my daily food intake would be removed. I live on bread. I've never tried anything gluten free, but used to have to buy "lactose free" stuff and I remembered the lousy taste of those things. I was sure that I was about to enter into a Life Devoid of Glutenous Joy.<br /><br />I tentatively made some pumpkin bread using the recipe on the back of the bag. I put it into the oven, fearing that I had just wasted half a can of pumpkin on something that would taste like old socks. Since the recipe used spices and sugar, it might be improved to taste like pumpkin spiced socks. The bread was done and I let it cool. Being impatient, cooling was a 10-15 minute period. Risking second degree burns, I sliced some off and was blown away. It was the best pumpkin bread I have ever tasted! There was no "something important is missing" flavor at all.<br /><br />I did alter the recipe a bit:<br /><br />3+ teaspoons of cinnamon<br />1/2 tsp allspice<br />1/2 tsp cloves<br />A slosh or two of vanilla extract (a "slosh" is roughly a teaspoon or so)<br />1/2 tsp nutmeg<br />4 TBSP butter flavored Crisco instead of butter/margarine<br />***No salt***<br /><br />The rest of the recipe and procedure was the same. It came out quite well according to the rest of the family, as well. I did not make the suggested topping, either.<br /><br />I don't know how long the bread will last. I put it in a heavy crystal covered cake thingy and it was gone in about three days. It didn't spoil, it was eaten.

review/summary: Helps me stay gluten-free
review/text: I purchased my first bag of Pamela's baking mix at the grocery store for a staggering price, but wanted to try it first before ordering three bags.  I'd already spent a small fortune on specialty flours, and had little success with recipes found online.  So I had high hopes that this would solve all of my gluten-free problems.<br /><br />On one hand it did.  As so many reviewers said, it makes wonderful pancakes.  I also tried it for a small batch of cookies and they came out very nice.  For biscuits and bread, however, it just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />But that's not the fault of the baking mix, more the fact that it doesn't contain gluten. I will keep looking for a bread that looks, feels and tastes like 'normal' bread, but the biscuits will work with things like sausage gravy.  Not so much with chicken gravy or stew.<br /><br />I am very glad I found it because pancakes give me something to have with eggs (at least until I can have toast again).  And when I want something sweet, sprinkling chocolate chips between a couple of them helps a lot.<br /><br />If the biscuits weren't as grainy and flat, and if the bread hadn't kept turning out much like a quick bread, I'd have given the mix five stars.

review/text: My best friend and her daughter have celiacs disease so I have been on the hunt to find a good flour substitute that is gluten free for baking. My best friend loves baked goods and since she was diagnosed about a year and a half ago she has not been able to get used to the texture of gf cake. I used this as a substitute in some cupcakes and I am amazed at how yummy they turned out! I think it actually made them taste better than my cupcakes I make that aren't gf! I even gave some to another friend and his whole family couldn't tell a difference. I highly recommend this mix!

review/text: After discovering a gluten sensitivity in my husband's diet, we've had some good success with gluten-free products, but they are so pricey and the variety/quantity is less than stellar at most grocery stores.<br /><br />Saw the glowing reviews of this product on Amazon and decided to give this mix a try. Last night I made fried chicken and biscuits for diner --just so see how this mix would do. AMAZING! My DH is from the south and grew up on homemade biscuits and LOVED the bisquick-like drop biscuits (recipe on the back of the bag), remarked on their great flavor, texture and lightness. And I LOVED how quick & easy they are to make --3 steps and 12 minutes in the oven. Barely any more work than popping a can of refrigerated biscuits. The fried-check was also a hit --made a great coating with a simple egg/milk dip, then dredge in the mix.<br /><br />Can't wait to try the cookie recipe next! HIGHLY recommended.

This is not an item that can be returned, but I donated my three bags to another family with celiac but no other allergies. Amazon should be more careful in listing all the allergens in its "allergy free" products.

review/text: Versatile says it all - I have yet to use it for a pancake mix - however, have used the mix to make southern style cornbread (my southern born husband loved it!).  One of the best ways I have used it was to make fried chicken tenders by making a batter with the mix then roll the battered chicken tenders in the dry mix and fry in a deep fryer - another big hit with my southern husband - and use honey mustard as a dip for the cooked chicken tenders.  Check out Pamela's website for several recipes for the mix.  For gluten intolerant folks - this products is heaven sent.

review/summary: The Best Pancake Mix Ever
review/text: This is the best G.F. Pancake Mix. I have Celiac and my children don't.(not yet anyway) and they DO NOT like my food and I usually have to begg them to taste things and then they spit it out. But i made Chocolate chip cookies with this mix and They came home from school and at all of them even after i told them they were G.F. They said you could not tell they were G.F. I made pancakes with it and they ate them all gone. By far the best tasting mix out there.

review/text: Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix is an important essential in my gluten free diet.  The pancakes are fabulous - light, fluffy and very delicious.  The muffins are excellent - not too sweet and especially great when baked with berries.  I highly recommend this to those on a gluten free diet and anyone else who enjoys delicious food.

review/text: Hey,<br />This baking mix is absolutely wonderful. I add extra baking powder for all my recipes with this mix. My chocolate chip cookies come out mouth watering delish. The pancakes are wonderful, just replace the water with milk, soy or almond milk and add 1/2 to one Tbs. of non-aluminum contained baking powder. You won't find another mix like it that's so yummy, versitile and gluten/wheat free.  Enjoy!

review/text: I wish you could find more recipes for this product. Translating it over to other recipes, you have to play with the leavening a bit. But when following the recipes written for the product..they turn out great! The chocolate chip cookies are really good. I doubled the recipe and baked in 15x11 pan. Perfect.

review/text: I really do use this mix as an all-purpose gluten free mix. I love it! I am gluten free, though my family is not, and they love it too. I have used it for waffles, pancakes, cookies, muffins, and breading for frying chicken. Actually, I use it pretty much anywhere a recipe calls for regular flour and it works very well. I like this better than Pamela's Amazing Bread mix, which I tried using as an all purpose mix and found it didn't work as well in that capacity. I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Absolutely Fantastic!
review/text: Our family LOVES Pamela's Pancake and Baking mix.  I have two litle boys 5 and 2 and they love the pancakes. I always add just a little bit more water to the batter than the recipe calls for and get the lightest, most even pancakes ever.  My family is gluten-sensitive but I am not.  Since discovering Pamela's I don't care if I ever have a gluten-made pancake again.  These are tremendous.  I've added choco chips, chopped fruit and pureed fruit to the batter and it all works wonderfully.  If you're looking for a delicious gluten-free pancake, this is the mix you want.  I have used it for banana breads and it's OK for that but not great.

review/summary: Amazing product
review/text: I had to start a gluten free diet and was really at a loss when it came to products I make all the time, like pancakes and biscuits for my children. A friend of mine suggested Pamela's after discussing my frustration with all things "gluten-free".  Hands down, this baking mix is one of the best I have ever found - GF or not. The batter is so light and fluffy and cooks up perfectly. I add some cinnamon sugar and vanilla to the pancake recipe on the back and always make a double batch to freeze and reheat later. It does remarkably well. And, my 6- yr old is quite the biscuit aficionado, and gave Pamela's biscuits two thumbs up. Cookie recipe is soon to follow......

Add 1 cup crunchy peanut butter. Add 2 eggs and vanilla. Add 2 cups Pamela's mix. 375�. Cool 5 mins.<br /><br />If I had tapioca flour I think I'd do half that and half P.M. with maybe a pinch of baking soda. But they're practically perfect now.<br /><br />Just buy a case, you won't be sorry.

review/text: My wife and son require a gluten free diet.  I use this mix to make waffles, pancakes, and cookies all the time.  People who've tested samples of my products using this have been shocked that it's gluten-free.  My 6 year old son has gone gluten free without blinking thanks to starting out with Pamela's Products.  My wife loves me for making large batches of waffles and pancakes and freezing them to make it easy for her to get the kids started in the mornings.

review/summary: Great gluten free product
review/text: First, if you haven't used this product before, you are getting 12 pounds of flour.  The due date (time it should be used up) was about 2 and a half months from time I received it.  (So plan on using this product fairly often.)  Now, as to analysis, I don't have to eat wheat free, gluten free food, so my bias here is toward taste and nutrition.  As to taste, I tried it in my sourdough waffles that I make, substituting the flour for the usual wheat flour and leavening agents (my original recipe called for baking soda, salt, and baking powder--apparently all are in this product), and the waffles turned out just as good if not better than the wheat ones.  I also tried it in the chocolate chip cookie recipe on the package, and I like those cookies better than the original wheat one. The taste is slightly different (I'm sorry, I can't quite put my finger on the difference.)  The cookies tend to be a little more moist and slightly thicker. I plan on trying more of the recipes on the back (there are at least 6 recipes on the back of the package). Nutrition wise, it's a mixed bag; you can't directly compare wheat flour to this mix as the mix has a lot of our minor things like salt which taint the analysis.  Calorie wise, it looks like the mix has more calories (but not a large difference).  To sum up, I really like the product for taste.  If you HAVE to have a gluten free product, I think it is a great alternative.

review/text: I've been using the Pamela's Baking and Pancake Mix for years and absolutely love it.  I have found this to be a wonderful substitution to convert "regular" recipes to be gluten free.  I've been pretty successful for a 1:1 substitution of the mix in most recipes, but make reductions to the baking soda/baking powder and guar/xantham gum mix if using it in a GF recipe that also has that included.  I can't recommend this mix enough!
