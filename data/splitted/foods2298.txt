review/text: Ordered "Dark Magic K-Cup - Box of 2". Therefore should be each box of 24 x 2 = 48 K-cups. I only received 1 box of 24. The company changes its name frequently and sends wrong quantity. Beware of non- Amazon sellers. Amazon contacted and will investigate the fraud. However, Amazon has easy return process.

review/text: Seeing such great deals here for Green Mountain Coffees, i assumed they would have the best deal on my Dark Magic blend I love. Most of the come in 2 packs with 24 in a pack. but the Dark Magic is clearly the exception. It is way over priced here. I can get an 18 pack in Target for $10, but low and behold over at coffee cow a 24 pack is 12.99 much better deal.

review/summary: Smooth and rich
review/text: Green Mountain Coffee Roasters began life as a cafe in rural Vermont. They specialized in quality coffee, and continue that tradition through to today.<br /><br />Now, with a name like Dark Magic Extra Bold, you might expect an overpowering coffee - you know, the kind that will grow hair on your chest whether you want it or not? Well, in fact, this coffee is smooth and rich, and (if made right) not overpowering at all. I find this to be a delicious coffee, one that I enjoy any day of the week.<br /><br />(Review of Green Mountain Dark Magic Extra Bold K-cup)

review/summary: Hits the Spot in the Morning
review/text: My Doctor only allows me two cups of caffeinated coffee per day, and if that is all I'm going to get, then by George this is the brand and the roast I'm going to be drinking!<br /><br />Rich, full bodied and aromatic. A hint in the aroma of spices, deep dark color, a taste that will perk you up and get you ready for the day.  There is  no bitterness, and this Dark Magic makes an excellent iced coffee as well as a superb hot coffee.<br />I also drink this later on in the day, (I drink more cups than I would like to admit in public) decaffeinated and it shares the same attributes as the fully caffeinated one.<br /><br />As far as expense goes---well yes it is more expensive than a store brand, but it truly is worth it. Not everyone shares my addiction so it won't be as costly for you as it is for me, and I think it works out to be about 66 cents a cup (without additives of sugar, creamer etc.) a far cry from anything you can get from any coffee shop, or drive thru.

I keep my Keurig brewer at the smallest cup setting and use 2 Dark Magics to fill a cup.  It's heaven.<br /><br />My husband likes coffee water (as someone in a review labeled it)and he goes for the Breakfast Blend on a larger cup setting.  But that is the wonderful thing about K-cups.  You can each have what you want.

review/text: The extra bold hints at a flavour that is strong with solid highpoints and this selecion is close to ideal. I have been using the Sumatran for a while but it was not strong enough. This selection is a little stronger but it tastes like a bit more roasting is all that separates the two. If you use this for a travel cup (8oz or more), it will not be as flavourful. I found that this flavour "grows" on you and a work colleague of mine absolutely loves this one.

review/summary: Not the same quality!
review/text: I compared the 18 cup Dark Magic (from Target) to the 50 cup Dark Magic(from Amazon), since the labeling and k-cup is markedly different.  The coffee did not taste as rich, so I became more curious.<br /><br />I opened the k-cups to find the 50 cup filters have a visible cross hatch pattern, as compared to a dense firm paper style.  I used a microscope to see the difference in density, as well.  The weave of the fibers of the 50 pack is not as closely bound.<br /><br />The coffee granules are finer in the 18 cup, giving the coffee a different texture on the fingers.  The 50 pack ground coffee appeared 50%-100% larger under the microscope.<br /><br />I hope that Keurig can shed some light on my findings!  I have photos I can submit.  I notice amazon is out of stock, currently.  Perhaps, Keurig is looking into the matter.

So, I tried this. We have used Green Mountain Coffee before, but not this particular product.<br /><br />Bottom line. My partner really enjoys this. The taste meets her expectations. Indeed, although I am supposed to keep my intake of caffeine fairly low, I have also tried this on occasion--and I, too, am satisfied.<br /><br />So, if you want a bolder flavor, this is worth considering.

review/text: This is a robust, aromatic and satisfying blend with balanced acidity and no bitterness.  It's a complex roast that's reminiscent of espresso with a subtly sweet taste, I love it.  I have had a difficult time finding truly strong, yet flavorful coffee for my Keurig brewer--Timothy's coffees are too acidic and Van Houtte blends lacked complexity--and  I've finally found several extra bold flavors from Green Mountain roasts that really deliver that morning one-two punch.  For comparison, my other favorites are the Espresso blend (sadly now discontinued) and Double Black Diamond (a bit more of a smoky flavor).  And for the most potent flavor profile, the Barista Prima Italian Roast is magnifico!

I did a search for extra dark coffee and found these for significantly less.  This coffee is perfect.  Rich, dark, flavorful, not at all bitter.  Smooth and delicious.  If you like dark roasts (French, Italian, etc) and have a k-cup machine, this is the coffee for you.

review/text: I just recently got my first Keurig machine (I say first because I love it, and plan to get the bigger pro model eventually), and a couple of sampler boxes. This was the best of the flavors I sampled, and that says alot because I loved most of them. I am a lifelong espresso drinker (Cubans start giving their kids sips at like age 3) so I like a strong coffee. This one is definitely that. It doesn't, however, suffer from the bitter aftertaste or "burnt" flavor of many bold blends. Best of all, with the Keurig machines you get the same flavor EVERY time.

review/summary: Full flavor at largest cup setting
review/text: I tried this from the sampler pack and couldn't get over how great it tasted when brewed at the largest (travel mug) setting in the Platinum brewer. Although I like the Breakfast Blend from Green Mountain for my actual breakfast cup of coffee, this is the one that is keeping me out of Starbucks!

review/summary: Product has changed
review/text: I've bee subscribing to this coffee for months now and have had multiple shipments, all quality until this last shipment.  I opened the new box today, made a cup, and wondered why it was so watery. Made a second thinking it was a fluke. It was not.  Seems now 3 kcups into the box, the whole box is full of kcups with about half the coffee in them there should be.  Instead of it being strong and bold like dark magic is supposed to be (I've drank this coffee daily for two years now so I should know)... It's weak and watery even on making a smaller cup of it.  Amazon won't let me return it.  I'm a dedicated amazon customer and use subscribe and save for many items.  If they won't treat me like a dedicated customer I might be stopping my membership.  Hoping they'll make it right.

review/summary: favorite 50 cent KCup is still elusive
review/text: Am still searching for a 50 cent K-Cup with decent flavor. This particular Extra Bold K-Cup is ok but is not anything special. Looking for discounts is tedious and tiresome. Have pretty much decided that the 50 count or 100 count "value" packs offer the best price available. Others swear by CostCo so it does help to shop around but the 50 cent K-Cup is still elusive. Extra Bold K-Cups as a whole seem to have better flavor than the regular variety.

review/text: We ran out of K-cups and I absolutely cannot begin my day without my coffee-jolt.  (WAY better than Red Bull, etc.)  Green Mountain Coffee is our preferred brand/flavor, so I decided to scan through Amazon.com to see if they carried it.  A 50-count box of Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic, (Extra Bold), was available at a crazy-low price, so I ordered it.  Not only did it arrive in perfect shape, before the promised delivery date, but there was 51 K-cups in the box!  A bonus!  Great coffee and great service at a great price!

review/summary: Awesome coffee
review/text: I bought the Keurig because when I wake up in the morning I'm a zombie that runs into walls and can't see past my nose, so I wanted a machine that would take any possibility of brain power needed out of making coffee for that oh so needed caffein punch in order to wake from my stupor. I have found though that the k-cups tend to produce watery and bland coffee at best, which is why it was such a nice surprise to find these dark magic extra bold k-cups! These things actually taste like decent coffee and aren't watery or acidic. Thanks green mountain for an awesome product and for curing my morning zombie woes! Oh and although a small gesture, I noticed that they shipped me 51 k-cups, thanks for the 1 extra!

review/text: I have been drinking dark magic for a long time, this in no way compares, its horrible, watery. I should have been suspicious when the coffee pods were floating free in the box rather than packed in the company box. I thought the first cup was an accident but today it tastes just as bad. Very disappointing and no return policy. Don't buy it its junk.

Decided to give this a try and so glad I did. The taste is right up there with my old favorite Dunkin Donuts coffee and the cost is much lower. I use fat-free half and half and splenda so it does make it alittle weaker, so thats perfect for my taste buds.

review/summary: Really amazed, and I am not usually amazed
review/text: I recently started having acid reflux and everyday I feel this sequences of chest congestion and nervousness. It has been like that for about 2 weeks and the prescription med my doctor prescribed (pantoprazole) isn't helping at all. Antacid (Tums) do help my condition somehow but I still need to deal with them everyday and I was taking like 10-14 antacid tablets per day, to somehow ease my discomfort.<br /><br />Then I read online about this natural remedy and was quickly turned off by the price. But the discomfort is really annoying, and I haven't had too much luck with natural supplements (they usually take a long time for you to feel any effect) so I was skeptic. Saw this at my local Whole Food and then finally decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />And here I am, writing my first Amazon review. Day 1 I feel a little better, seems to calm it a little bit, day 2 I only felt some slight discomfort througout the day. And by day 4, the only time I feel anything is when I try to sleep at night, but even so it is very very light discomfort. And I no longer feel ANY discomfort in the daytime, NONE! So far I have only been taking this for about 5 days and already a very happy man. I stopped taking medications and just half tea spoon 3 times a day. I'm gonna order a bunch of these from amazon now!

review/summary: Manuka Honey
review/text: I am extremely satisfied with this product.  I had/have a nasty wound on the inside of my left foot that was about 8" long and nothing was helping it heal very fast.  Since I have been putting this Manuka honey on my foot every 12 hrs. and covering it with a nonstick pad each time, it has started healing fast and is now a little less than 2" in 6 weeks.  I also take a teaspoon twice a day internally.  I have told everyone what I am doing, including the Dr., and he told me to keep it up because it was unbelievable how quickly it was healing.  Some members of my family have ordered 2 jars each and are also using it.  I will never be without it as long as I can afford it.  It has gone up $3 per jar in less than two months since I have been ordering.  May have to check out other sources.<br /><br />I also know that local unprocessed honey is very good for anyone and can be used in the same way.  But I think the Manuka honey has some properties in it that the local honey doesn't have.

review/summary: VERY TASTY
review/text: Ordered this because of some minor stomach issues. Certainly, hasn't hurt, but not sure it has all the healing powers others claim, but only time will tell. A few things...this honey tastes great, just about like regular honey. So don't be afraid to order it thinking you can't handle the taste. It has the consistency of a honey butter spread and is great right out of the jar, or on toast. Bottom line, probably more expensive than regular honey, but if you have some digestive issues, worth trying, as it is a good tasting product.

review/summary: Love This Honey
review/text: I've used other distributors of Manuka Honey and by far this is the best tasting of them all.  The taste and consistency is perfect.  If you are looking for a honey that your palate will love or use this product for medicinal purposes (and it does have many) this is the one to purchase.

review/summary: Awesome, Manuka is the real deal!
review/text: So, here's the deal. I'm a skeptic, if it sounds to good to be true...it probably is.<br />My mom has a stage II bedsore and while it's not as gross as the other stages, I knew it could get worse. I did lots of online research and kept coming across this 'Manuka Honey'.<br /><br />In the meantime all the hospital had given me for her wound, (sorry for the graphic detail), which is right at the crack of her butt , was a second skin type of material. This stuff has a slight adhesive that is supposed to stick to the skin without tearing it. The thing was that because of the location, it wasn't sticking and the wound was getting worse.<br /><br />Bottom line, this stuff ain't cheap, but it works. For those of you who have had experience with this sort of sore before know it can be a very long process to cure. I am happy to say that after 3 days of usage, I started seeing results! It's been almost 3 weeks now and almost all of the pinkness is gone and moms sore is about 1/4 the size it was before we started using Manuka.<br /><br />As a postscript, I had a cut on my hand and used it for a couple of days...it did the trick.<br />This is the real deal, and for those of you (like me) who care, it's holistic.

review/summary: This is the stuff!
review/text: I have tried a variety of high UMF honey brands, and this is the best tasting, most effective brand I've tried, and nowadays, Wedderspoon's 16 is the only stuff I buy.<br /><br />Think about it. If you're using Manuka honey to treat various gastrointestinal troubles (we use it any time we suspect food poisoning, intestinal virus, heartburn, reflux, ulcer, etc.... and there is NOTHING better!) then why would you use anything other than organic? Seriously. Any time your stomach just doesn't feel right, dip a teaspoon (a regular silverware-type, not a measuring teaspoon) half way into your honey (no need to "scoop", just dip), and eat it. You will feel relief so quickly you will NEVER reach for a Rolaid again. This has worked wonderfully on all 3 of my children as well.<br /><br />I only buy my Wedder's from Amazon, (not Marketplace) and I take advantage of the Super Saving Shipping. (Late in the season it can be hard to find, so I've learned to stock up for the year.) Remember: New Zealand seasons are the opposite of ours, and honey is not harvested in the winter/spring). So if you live in the US, and you're using Manuka honey, it may get a little tough to find during our summer/fall, since that is the New Zealand winter/spring.<br /><br />I have NEVER had any trouble with the way the honey's been shipped. It's always been taped, bubble packed, etc., and never has any of it shown any signs of leakage. Even so, buying from Amazon, the possibility of leakage has never been a worry, because in my experience, Amazon stands behind what it sells. Who else does that?  :o)

review/summary: great product
review/text: I swear by this honey every time I get a sore throat, cold or similar problem.  For years I had problems with every single cold evolving into a nasty sinusitis infection.  Now at the first sign of a cold and/or sore throat I start drinking white tea with this honey in it, many times a day.  If I have a sore throat I will take teaspoons of this by itself.  My colds are healing faster, my throat feels better faster, and I am not having sinusitis after colds anymore. I am also doing other things like sinus rinses, but I have always done that.  This honey seems to have added a significant benefit to my health.  It does cost a fortune but I just ordered another bottle and will continue to use it.

review/summary: It seems to be working ...
review/text: My mom is 60 and has irritable bowel syndrome that makes her running to the bathroom for the slightest variation in food/beverage temperature or oiliness.  She couldn't drink anything too hot or too cold, couldn't have certain kind of steamed fish (because of fat contents), and sometimes it just happens for no reason.  After reading some of the reviews here and with her friend's recommendation, she started taking a teaspoon of the honey every morning with empty stomach.  She's on the 3rd jar of honey now, and her condition has improved quite a bit.  Regular bowel every day, and she can even enjoy some ice cream and popsicle without worrying too much.  Although she is still very careful with her eating habit, and she still gets diarrhea once a while, but it was not nearly as frequent as before (at least once a week).  The only time when things kind of went back to the old time was when she was on antibiotics, and it seemed to have kill all the good germs along with the bad ones in her system.  She also started taking yoga lessons last year, which I think is beneficial to her overall health.  This honey doesn't smell or taste like the regular American honey you see in the supermarket.  It is darker in color, and has a medicinal smell.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I've had gasto-intestinal problems for quite awhile, and the doctor finally recommended I try alternative methods of treatment for awhile. My cousin learned about Manuka honey, and I chose to try Wedderspoon's because of their company policies: truly organic, no artificial raising of the activity level, etc.  I could tell a difference within three days!  I had my daughter try it and she had the same experience. Stomach pain gone or much lessened, reflux much more controlled, and NO side effects like those with all the various medicines.  I'm excited to see what can be accomplished over time as we continue using this awesome product.

review/text: As soon as you open the jar, you'll know this is the real deal. It just looks right. It tastes right. It smells right. You can tell they're not lying when they call it raw. I love it, and my Aunt who was diagnosed a few months ago with lung cancer (she's ok, thank God) has been taking a spoon or two of this daily. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the honey, pomegranate, olive oil and just generally healthy, non-processed foods she's been eating exclusively helped her reduce the cancer cells moreso than the medicine the doctor prescribed her.<br /><br />If you're looking for honey, look no further.

review/text: I had a cold so a friend gave me this honey telling me it would help. I was already well into a few days of feeling bad so I gave this remedy a try. I'm not sure if it was the honey or because I had a mild case of the louses. But, my cold didn't last as long as it usually does. Plus, whenever I had a cough, it helped ease the cough much better than cough syrup.<br />Now that I'm over the nasty old cold, I still enjoy this honey. I found the taste much better than any other honey I've ever tasted. I also find it to be not near as sweet which makes it even more enjoyable. It goes great with toast or just a spoonful by itself. Therefore, I would recommend this product no matter what you use it for.

review/summary: Help my wound heal! A miracle!!
review/text: I was skeptical at first using honey to heal a wound, but my nephew has surgery on his knee and the doctors used medical honey to pack the wound and it healed perfectly.  I had surgery on a pilonidal cyst in December and the wound opened up.  The surgeon told me it would heal on it's own, but it kept on getting infected.  I ordered the Manuka honey and applied with gauze and it instantly started to heal.  Within 8 weeks the wound had totally healed up(it was a deep wound!)I couldn't believe how well the honey had worked.  I am a believer. When my kids get scrapes and cuts, I put a little honey on a band aid now. Side note: I wouldn't use it to eat though, as it has a very medicinal smell and taste.

review/summary: Manuka Honey -
review/text: I had bought Manuka Honey from recent trip to NewZealand. Paid almost $35 for 17.6oz bottle. First, I was skeptic until I used it. I occasionally suffer from GERD and took Nexium. I used Manuka Honey 3/4 teaspoon at bedtime and immediately all symptoms went away. I took 1 teaspoon for 3 days every time I felt like flu or cold symptoms and it worked every time. So, I was looking for ordering more. This Wedderspoon organic variety is not the same as original from NZ but it has almost same quality. Cost is almost same. Fast delivery.

This is by far the best price I've seen for this same Wedderspoon's Manuka Honey Active 16+.
