review/summary: My picky dog loves these poppers
review/text: My dog is extremely picky - when he gets a new treat or a food he is unfamiliar with, he will spit it out after the first taste. Even when he likes a particular treat, there's no guarantee he will continue to eat it, so it is tough to find things he will like long term.  I bought a small bag of chicken poppers just to try.  Not only did my dog like them on first taste, but he has not become bored with them.  I bought the 1lb canister and when that is finished I will be stocking up on plenty more.

review/summary: Lili's favorite time of the day from Amazon.com.......Smokehouse chicken poppers treats
review/text: My little 1 year old Lili, who is part mini Dachshund and we think Chihuahua, she absolutely loves these Smokehouse treats, before this product came along, they  ate different treats and had stomach issues, got fatter and sometimes just did not actually eat it. Lili likes to sit up to get one, gives kisses to get one and loves it so much when I roll her one across the living room floor, this yummy chicken poppers makes have a fun too, she chases it down, throws it in the air and her tails wags intensely - it becomes an eatable "ball" game.<br />We have used this treat to teach her to go out to do her business since she was 2 months old and now as soon as we come inside from a successful potty run, she sits near the container and stares at it patiently and lady like, with one paw on the container we use until we give her one, then she is a happy little camper, she also has found sneaky and absolutely incredible and creative tactics to actually steal the one that belongs to her kennel mate Chachi, he is 14 loves the treats too but likes to savor his, of course we replace his stolen one if Lili is succesful in getting his, He does protect it watchfully as best he can to prevent it being stolen, and he will walk around with it in his mouth until ready to much it down.<br />They both love it and we love giving it to them, great product... Thank goodness Amazon.com has it on their site with free shipping living too a huge bonus in Hawaii is sometimes a challenge to get great stuff at a reasonable price.... shipping is free so we can afford to buy from Amazon.com  Thank you so much!!!!!<br />love it in Hawaii, Lili and Chachi's "mom"

review/summary: The perfect treat for even the pickiest of eaters!
review/text: I have two min pins that absolutely love these chicken poppers! The second they hear the resealable bag opening they run to me at full speed. I use these as training treats and give out way more than I should in a day. Nonetheless, I've been feeding them to my dogs for a little over a year now and neither of them have lost their love for chicken poppers. The only bit of advice I have to offer is watch out for the size of the poppers. I have a larger dog who chows them down like m&ms, while my smaller dog treats it like a jawbreaker. Hes able to eventually chew it up, but it does take him much longer (which is a plus for most dog owners!) For the smaller one, I try to pick out the smaller poppers. You definitely can't go wrong with these treats though. They are made of the best quality and your dogs can vouch for that!

review/summary: hardy and healthy
review/text: I think they are absolutely perfect for training. They are easy to throw and deliver quickly in training distance, particularly in utility obedience go outs. They dog can hear them hit and find them quickly so there is no searching for crumbs etc. They also fit in my dogs kong-like spaceship and he can entertain himself for 15 mins working to fish them out.They also hold up well for most of the year inside the car or a tracking bag. I can also feel them well with mittens on inside my coat in the winter. Very big plus this winter training in the northeast this winter. Poppers also float. this is a huge asset for training water dog work. also the dog can smell them well enough to find them in the water.<br /><br />I love the product I find the availability needs to be improved. I prefer the round ball shape and that is the variety that is hardest to find.!!<br /><br />I am going to try them in the treat in train next.<br /><br />Lisa  NJ

review/summary: Oh Myyyyy
review/text: Now, I'm a Southern girl through and through, but I'm going to let you in on a little secret...I was born a Yankee. Yup, born in South Bend, Indiana and raised in Michigan until I was ten, when we moved to Tennessee. As a Michigander, I can say with complete confidence that Michigan blueberries are the best blueberries in the entire world. Blueberry season comes around and the state explodes into a world of deliciousness. You can stop at just about any roadside stand and get a ten pound box of blueberries, or you can head out to one of those you-pick places, if you're feeling particularly energetic (or you've got young kids...I'm looking at you, Mom!). Blueberries played a huge role in my childhood. We would snatch up all the blueberries we could during the season and freeze them. Blueberry pancakes, muffins, and cobblers were served all year round, but my favorite blueberry dish was blueberry ice cream. It's a real complicated recipe, y'all ready? You take frozen blueberries and pour cold milk over them. Yup. We're a simple folk.<br /><br />But my love of blueberries has come with me through my travels and life path. So when I spotted a blueberry matcha, my immediate reaction was one of "Um, heck yes, please!" The scent when I open the package is to die for. Oh my goodness, blueberry. In your face, juicy, sweet blueberry. My mouth is watering already.<br /><br />The taste? Oh my. No, no, let me rephrase that. Imagine that I'm George Takei. Oh myyyyyy. Yep, it's that good. George Takei "Oh myyy" inducing good. You know when you go into one of those bath and body stores, and you pick something blueberry up, smell it, and immediately tell your wife you wish you had something that tastes as good as it smells and then you lick it and it just plain doesn't taste as good as you want it to? No? Just me? Well, this matcha tastes the way those soaps smell. Intensely blueberry and incredibly delicious. Juicy is just the word that comes to mind with every sip...it's incredible. I have a few blueberry fans among my friends who will go ape over this.<br /><br />This review brought to you by the letter M and the number 2, which is the number of cups of matcha I've had this morning in an effort to taste them all and get my reviews written...and it's only nine o'clock. Pray for my wife, folks, she's in for a crazy morning.

review/summary: Fresh, plump, juicy blueberry Matcha!
review/text: Yummeh. Blueberries are not my favorite fruit, but when I opened my package I knew I was going to love this just as much as the mango. The scent was strong blueberry! It reminded me of fruit leather, deep purple, chewy, yummy homemade fruit leather by the hippie auntie I used to have. Ah sense memory, I love it so.<br />So I whisked up this delight with the plan to make a couple little lattes - one with soymilk, one with almond and one with regular. I don't know, I just wanted to taste the nuances and find my favorite pairing I guess! Also to see which milk went best with fruit flavoured matcha.<br /><br />Honestly though, I really enjoyed this one sans milk - just with some sugar. (I also experimented with sweetener, and found I prefer sugar over agave for my matcha).<br /><br />The froth! I got a crazy amount of froth with no clumps in this batch. I definitely credit the quality of the matcha for that, because my whisk skills are shoddy at best. That's when I knew I was in for a treat today. This blueberry matcha in particular was very smooth. The berry taste fluctuated from sip to sip - one sip it was a tart not quite ripe berry, the second it was an overly plump, huge juicy ripe berry. The aftertaste was definitely the latter. The flavouring felt more strong in this batch than I expected, but I loved that very much. What a deal :D Again, I love that this company uses natural flavouring - it really shows in the quality of this matcha that it tastes like the berries, not like a candy.<br />With almond milk, the matcha latte tastes almost like a baked good - a blueberry matcha scone or shortbread. The soymilk tasted, well, like soymilk (I think it was my least favorite of the 3). With hot frothed 2% milk it was very sweet. I find hot milk to be naturally sweet, so that probably accounts for it!<br /><br />Last, but certainly not least, I had it as an iced latte. (If you're wondering, with all this crazy matcha energy - I'm learning the ukulele!) I HIGHLY recommend enjoying these fruit flavour matchas from Red Leaf Tea as iced lattes. Oh my goodness! The fruit flavour just comes alive and honestly tasted like a blended real fruit smoothie. Of course, once I get a blended I will be making blended iced drinks 100% - but until then, the ice cubes will suffice.

review/summary: Mmmmm Matcha!
review/text: In the tea base and flavoring itself, is that the green matcha really nicely stands out even more so than in some of the other flavors I have bought. You know, the more I drink this the more I am loving it for that very reason. You lose none of the blueberry flavor mixing it with a shake, latte, smoothie, whatever... and the green matcha base comes out even MORE! Its like some magical blueberry matcha gnomes came in while I was not looking and sprinkled some mojo on it! Mmmmmm. Such an interesting flavor, as I continue to drink I seem to pick up different subtle nuisances in this tea mixture. I mean I am used to that in non matcha teas, but I have to say this is the first matcha, let alone a flavored matcha I have tasted something slightly different each and every time! Sometimes its just really fresh and refreshING, other sips I get more sweet, some sips I am getting far more of the matcha base with that vegetal buttery sensation, other times I get peppery note even! Its strange, and enjoyable.

review/summary: In Jan. 2009, the price of these nearly doubled ... why?
review/text: My dogs seem to like these treats, and the ingredient list suggests that there are only two ingredients - chicken and rice.  So, I have been purchasing these for a few years now, and both of my dogs like them (although the border collie has grown bored with them and will occassionaly reject them).  However, my concern is with the price of this product.  In Dec. 2008, I purchased this product (1 pound in a tub) for 10.99.  Now, in early february 2009, they have raised the priced to 18.55 - that has nearly doubled, so I won't be buying these unless the price drops back to somewhat reasonable.

review/summary: Not for little guys tho'...
review/text: My 21 lb mixed breed who can (and does) eat just about anything had a bit of trouble with the size of the Poppers -- a bit too big for him to handle. If they made a smaller size, I know he'd gobble them up. I passed the bag on to a friend who has larger dogs and they devoured them.

review/summary: Chickrn Poppers!  Amazing!!!
review/text: I had a small bag of Chicken Poppers that I took on a trip with us.  Dogs can get pretty finacky in a strange environment but the chicken poppers really settled her down.  And they had such a satisfying crunch when she ate them!  I had no idea where to get more, but then I found them on Amazon!  THanks for a great product!

review/summary: Lili's favorite time of the day from Amazon.com.......Smokehouse chicken poppers treats
review/text: My little 1 year old Lili, who is part mini Dachshund and we think Chihuahua, she absolutely loves these Smokehouse treats, before this product came along, they  ate different treats and had stomach issues, got fatter and sometimes just did not actually eat it. Lili likes to sit up to get one, gives kisses to get one and loves it so much when I roll her one across the living room floor, this yummy chicken poppers makes have a fun too, she chases it down, throws it in the air and her tails wags intensely - it becomes an eatable "ball" game.<br />We have used this treat to teach her to go out to do her business since she was 2 months old and now as soon as we come inside from a successful potty run, she sits near the container and stares at it patiently and lady like, with one paw on the container we use until we give her one, then she is a happy little camper, she also has found sneaky and absolutely incredible and creative tactics to actually steal the one that belongs to her kennel mate Chachi, he is 14 loves the treats too but likes to savor his, of course we replace his stolen one if Lili is succesful in getting his, He does protect it watchfully as best he can to prevent it being stolen, and he will walk around with it in his mouth until ready to much it down.<br />They both love it and we love giving it to them, great product... Thank goodness Amazon.com has it on their site with free shipping living too a huge bonus in Hawaii is sometimes a challenge to get great stuff at a reasonable price.... shipping is free so we can afford to buy from Amazon.com  Thank you so much!!!!!<br />love it in Hawaii, Lili and Chachi's "mom"

review/summary: The perfect treat for even the pickiest of eaters!
review/text: I have two min pins that absolutely love these chicken poppers! The second they hear the resealable bag opening they run to me at full speed. I use these as training treats and give out way more than I should in a day. Nonetheless, I've been feeding them to my dogs for a little over a year now and neither of them have lost their love for chicken poppers. The only bit of advice I have to offer is watch out for the size of the poppers. I have a larger dog who chows them down like m&ms, while my smaller dog treats it like a jawbreaker. Hes able to eventually chew it up, but it does take him much longer (which is a plus for most dog owners!) For the smaller one, I try to pick out the smaller poppers. You definitely can't go wrong with these treats though. They are made of the best quality and your dogs can vouch for that!

review/summary: hardy and healthy
review/text: I think they are absolutely perfect for training. They are easy to throw and deliver quickly in training distance, particularly in utility obedience go outs. They dog can hear them hit and find them quickly so there is no searching for crumbs etc. They also fit in my dogs kong-like spaceship and he can entertain himself for 15 mins working to fish them out.They also hold up well for most of the year inside the car or a tracking bag. I can also feel them well with mittens on inside my coat in the winter. Very big plus this winter training in the northeast this winter. Poppers also float. this is a huge asset for training water dog work. also the dog can smell them well enough to find them in the water.<br /><br />I love the product I find the availability needs to be improved. I prefer the round ball shape and that is the variety that is hardest to find.!!<br /><br />I am going to try them in the treat in train next.<br /><br />Lisa  NJ

review/text: I received TWO (2) 24-pack boxes of this product; not the 12-pack as pictured. The price is better than I get at the grocery store (Amazon Prime member).<br /><br />I've tried other brands of cat food, even the more expensive "healthier" brands; I even try the regular Whiskas. But, the Tender Bites is kitty's favorite! I can't get him to eat any other kind anymore. If I try, he refuses and turns to his dry cat food until I clean the dish and refresh with Tender Bites!

I think it's a very good product, it's not filled with too many fillers, and it doesn't smell too strong. The biggest downfall with all of these Whiskas pouches is that they are messy to dispense, and it is very difficult to get all of the product out of the pouch.  I find I get the gravy all over my hands, not the biggest issue, but ewww.

review/text: We have six indoor cats, and they all have different likes.  Our siamese cat will only eat the Whiskas Tender Bites chicken.  That is the only flavor she likes, and it has to be the tenderbites.  She usually just likes the juice but will sometimes eat some of the food as well.  Why she only likes this one, I don't know.  Amazon is the only place I know to get the box of 24 in the chicken only.  I rated it five stars because she likes it!

review/summary: Messy and apparently undelicious
review/text: My cat is not a huge fan. Sure, she'll lap up the gravy, but leaves the little meat-like bits as dry as a bone. It feels like saving money, but not if your cat is only gonna eat cornstarch gravy and turn her nose up at the meat by-products. It's probably fine for a grocery-store food, but a better quality food will make your cat happier and maybe healthier. Also I can't imagine gravy has got the nutritional content my cat needs.<br /><br />Pouches seem like a great idea compared to messy, annoying cans, until you can't figure out a way to get the stuff out of the package without getting gravy all over your hands.<br /><br />I switched to Merrick cat foods and my cat is happier--she doesn't leave lots of uneaten bits.

review/text: I purchased this as an option for my cat since he only eats chicken. This is a much drier and diced product (no juice) as compared to the other Whiskas products in a pouch. However, the pouch is quite stuff, so if you cat likes it, he will surely get enough to eat from this pouch. Also, the picture does not look like the product I was shipped.

review/summary: Cats are carnivores
review/text: Our older cat (14 years old) would only lick the juice from the bowl and let the chunks alone.  I've read since then that cats are carnivores and therefore should not be fed a grain-based diet.  So many cat foods on the market have grains as the main components, and so you have to look for products labeled "grain free".  We found some at our local feed store.  Maybe our first cat would have lived longer if we'd fed him better.

Each of the four flavors says "in juices" after it.  But since the formula changed, there is absolutely no juice in this food.  The food comes out in one big dry clump.  The juice was my cat's favorite part.  I'll still by the other Whiska's flavors, but not this one.

Unless of course  48 means 48 - 12 pack boxes.  Then the description needs  a little work.

review/summary: Tangy Cheezy Perfection
review/text: The Cheesiest of Cheez. It's tangy and tastes a bit like American cheese. A thick, smooth paste you can put on crackers. It also comes in very handy for people who don't know how to cook. With this, you can hide that fact. At least long enough to make your special someone one very easy meal. They never need to know it started with Cheez Whiz.<br />You'll need 1 box of noodles, 8 ounces of shredded cheese, a mix of Mexican and Italian and you can honestly call it your 7 cheese pasta dish. You don't say macaroni and cheese when it's 7 cheeses! and a half a jar of Cheez Whiz. To make it really fancy, also get a bag of frozen broccoli florets and maybe a can of chicken. If that's not too much cooking. If it is, skip them.<br />Cook the noodles according to the directions on the bag. Strain them.If you're adding broccoli, put it in the strainer before straining the noodles. Then you're steaming it at the same time. Leave them in the strainer while you put the Cheez Whiz and cheese into the same pan. Melt them together stirring constantly. If it looks too thick, throw in a bit of milk, or water if you just don't have any milk. Put the noodles back in and mix it all up good. Add canned chicken if you'd like. Serve with a bit of extra cheese on top, or maybe some toast with butter and a sprinkle of garlic. Think of some good name for it. "Oh honey, I wanted to treat you to my special Pasta Discursive, it has a 7 cheese sauce, chicken breast and steamed broccoli."<br />Nobody has ever guessed the secret ingredient is Cheez Whiz when I make this for them. Then for myself later, I eat the other half with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013A1WGC">Nabisco-Ritz Crackers</a> or heat it and serve it over tortilla chips, the empty wide mouthed jar makes a good place to keep loose change or small hardware.

review/text: Every now and then I'll try a different popcorn, but haven't found one I like better than Crimson Jewell Red.  (In fact, I've ended up feeding some of the others to the backyard birds.) Flavor is rich and satisfying.  I like the convenient package, too.  It has a nice shape and is easy to grab even from my highest shelf; large opening and lid. Prompt delivery from vendor.

review/summary: Bad taste
review/text: I have been buying the fireworks popcorn from Amazon and have been very happy with it. I bought this to try something different. First of all I was disappointed by the rather small container for the price, but then I was very disappointed by the taste. I use canola oil in an electric popper. This popcorn had a slight taste of insecticide. I tasted it in every batch from the jar. It was a very distinctive and unpleasant taste.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Omaha Steaks' Franks are really quite delicious but I could not find out what meats are put into them so I only buy them on rare occasions.  Their web site is really geared for pure beef products with no explanations for products of multiple origins.  I know my sister has multiple GI problems but she can eat one of these every once in a while without a stomach upset.  She does complain of the salt content though.  If you don't care how these hotdogs are made then I highly recommend them for great flavor.

review/summary: Lesser evil for less of me!!  These things rock!!
review/text: I discovered Lesser Evil snacks about 6 months ago when I started a serious diet.  Being a salty, crunchy addict, I was eager to try anything to help me avoid temptation.  The Krinkle Sticks are fantabulous.  You get the satisfaction of a crunchy snack, tastiness and, most important for me - size.  The servings are so generous you can't believe the bang for your buck.  Unlike the 100 calorie snack packs popping up all over - which normally are teeny tiny - these snacks last.  When I'm done eating them, I feel like I've had a real treat.  I even have my two teenage sons hooked.  For the price - great value.  In case you are curious - I have lost 30 pounds in the last 6 months and Lesser Evils have been on my diet plan the whole time.  Highly, highly recommend.

review/summary: Too good, but watch the bag weight
review/text: I too love the Krinkle Sticks.  I order them thru Amazon on a monthly basis at a great price.  I only have one complaint.  I noticed that one of my bags looked fuller than usual, so I got out my kitchen scale and it weighed 1.8 ounces.  So I then weighed several more bags, and each bag weighed a different amount, and all were over the stated weight on the bag.  So, if you are diligent in counting calories, it would probably be a good idea to weigh your bags so you know exactly how many calories you are really taking in.  I just separated them into individual Baggies weighing one ounce, or 1.2 ounces and they stayed just as fresh and I can be sure I know how many calories I am really eating.

There is a bit of a...somewhat "powdered" aspect (that's pretty much what they are) and there's definitely a residue on your teeth after eating them, but I'm glad I bought them and will enjoy them as an occasional treat.

One of these days, I'd like to try a true 'fresh-squeezed' olive oil from a known grower.  I imagine it'd be like eating a garden-grown tomato instead of one from a supermarket.

If you drink it you can taste  nothing,but when you swallow it ,it has a mild burn  with zero after taste. I use too much of this stuff when I cook because I marinate things in it,then dump more on my food. I also use it on my skin,if you can't drink it,you shouldn't put it on your body,the skin is the most important part of your body. I give this oil a ten out of ten,two thumbs up.

review/text: OK first off, this wonderful oil is not associated with the Badia Spice Company.<br />They are a great outfit, but not affiliated with this Tuscan estate.<br /><br />Golden yellow with hearty green nuances, this oil has a balanced fruity flavor<br />with a hint of toasted nuts. The distinct peppery sensation produced at the back<br />of your throat on the oil's finish is an attribute of oil whose olive harvest was<br />young and fresh. This oil is very rich and is perfect for dressing salads, meats,<br />pasta, soup and particularly with your favorite breads.<br /><br />Sounds expensive but its not, worth every penny.

I found them after I had already ordered on Amazon.  These are expensive on Amazon, so shop around your area first.
