The nuts came in packages of two.  I ordered two pounds and froze the other three packages.  The seller sent them to me quickly which I appreciate.  And they are organic, which is also a plus.

review/text: We like this mix when time is shorter or I don't have everything I need for chicken curry made from scratch.  It is a hot mix, but with Shan spice mixes you can use what you like, so if you're leery of the heat, I would suggest just using 1/4-1/2 a packet first. If you want it hotter next time, increase the amount.  I'm surprised at the price for this - we get these mixes locally for 99 cents a box.  Might want to check with the seller what quantity this price is for.

Like the previous review, I thought the temperature was too high for baking, so I bake them at 325 degrees.  I use 3/4 c. liquid egg substitute for the 3 egg whites, put 7 chocolate chips on each muffin top (I use Vitalicious silicone muffin top pans), and bake them about 20 - 22 minutes.  With the Super Saver Shipping option, stock up...I did!

review/summary: tasty, filling, and guilt free
review/text: Vitamuffins taste good, are healthy, have a lot fiber, and are low in fat and calories. It's rare to find this combination of traits. Unfortunately, the muffins are fairly expensive - around $1 per muffintop in the store. The upside is that Vitalicious sells the mix, which enables you to make many vitamuffins for an affordable price. I bought a muffintop pan, but you can also just put muffin top liners on a baking pan.<br /><br />These are the perfect afternoon stack when I'm craving something sweet. They're filling, tasty, and guilt free.<br /><br />The chocolate flavor is my favorite. I actually don't like any of the other flavors.<br /><br />Note that the muffins are recommended by weight watchers and hungrygirl.

When you take them out, microwave each one for about 35 seconds and it seems like you are eating fudge cake.  I also mixed in a few chocolate bits into the batter as well as on top.  Filling the paper cups half way it made about 12 muffins.

review/summary: pretty good
review/text: So I bought these because I started Weight Watchers and they are 1-point. I must say that they are quite good although not 5-star good. Some notes:<br /><br />1. I made them both the way stated on the box and the way another reviewer suggested with egg substitute. They are MUCH better made with real egg whites as it says on the box.<br /><br />2. I took other reviewers advice about the timing and would do about 350-375 degrees (my oven is old and strange) for around 22-27 minutes checking them with a wooden toothpick for readiness. Once done I would eat one and wait a bit for them to cool until putting them all in a freezer bag and storing them. Whenever I wanted one I would take one out and put it in the microwave for 25-30 seconds. Out of the microwave they tasted almost exactly the same as fresh out of the oven.<br /><br />3. They are really easy to make. It takes about 5 minutes. I used just some standard muffin/cupcake tin I have lying around. I do not use muffin wrappers and instead just spray with pam or cooking spray.<br /><br />4. This mix is INFINITELY better than the premade ones. I ordered them concurrently and after  finish this review, I am now going to go over to the premade sampler pack I bought, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DF2UR2">Vitalicious Chocolate Super Sampler, 2-Ounce Units (Pack of 20)</a>, and give them a one star review. This is because I still have almost all of the premade ones in my freezer. I am never tempted to eat them. They taste like cardboard. Unfortunately, with the bake-your-own, I wake up in the middle of the night craving them.<br /><br />5. Just a note for you Weight Watcher people. One of these = 1 point. Two of these = 3.5 points. So sad. It is hard to stop at one.

review/summary: Yum-O.....
review/text: These vitamuffins are absolutely yummy.  I first bought the already made muffins at the supermarket for $5.00, quantity of 4.  I thought they were delicious but didn't want to spend so much money on just 4 muffins.  Then I found the mix on Amazon and thought it was absolutely worth the money.  You get 12 muffins from each box which is twice as many muffins for about the same price and they're so easy to make, you can't go wrong.  Just be careful when making them though, the box says to put the oven at 400 degrees and bake for 23-27 minutes but the first box I made got burned on the bottom when I listened to those instructions.  The second box I made came out perfect.  I pre-heated the oven at 300 degrees and when I put them in, raised the temperature to 325 degrees and baked for approximately 17-18 minutes, checked them once in between that time.  I don't know if my oven just gets too hot or what but just keep an eye on them.  Other than that, it's a great and healthy snack and if you're on Weight Watchers like I am, for 1 point a muffin, you just can't get anything better than that to satisfy that chocolate craving.

review/text: I discovered VitaMuffin in the grocery store a few years ago and have been hooked ever since!  I'd buy them in the freezer isle and they'd come in a box of 4 for $5.  Well, I moved to a new city and the frozen VitaMuffins are nowhere to be found... so I gave the mix a try.  Not only are they so much less expensive this way, they are just as good and maybe even better than the store bought frozen ones!  You just need egg whites and some mini chocolate chips (mix them into the batter & throw a few on top!).  I bake them at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes -- I think they would be overcooked if I baked them at the recommended 400 degrees.  Freeze them, and when you're ready to have one - pop it in the microwave for about 25 seconds.  YUM.

review/text: Not only do I love these muffins, I love that I was able to buy the mix at a low price, in a package of three to stock up. It costs about $5 or maybe $6 in the store for only 4 of them. It's crazy!!! This is my favorite flavor because I'm a chocolate lover. helps alot with the dieting. Very filling with the fiber. Taste is fantastic!!! I bought a muffin top baking pan, and freeze them in separate plastic wraps. Microwave for 20 seconds when frozen, and they are great. Oh, and the packaging was great!

review/summary: Helped Me Get Back to Goal
review/text: As a Weight Watcher, I had gained 15 pounds and was struggling to get back to goal.  When I found these delicious one-point muffins, and had one each day as a special treat, I was not so tempted to eat other sweets.  My husband could eat his Costco muffin and I had my own muffin.  I am two pounds from my goal now and these muffins are partially responsible for getting me there.  I really love them.

review/summary: Good If You Don't Expect Too Much
review/text: I bought these muffins because I'm trying to increase the fiber in my daughter's diet.  After reading these reviews, my expectations were very high.  I was expecting them to taste as good as the 'regular' sugar laden muffins that, let's face it, taste like cupcakes.  If that is what you are expecting, you will be disappointed.  These do not taste nearly as good as those bakery-bought, high caloric muffins. They are rather bland and not very sweet.  I can't understand how anyone could call them delicious. They are not delicious.  However, my picky 8 year old will eat them.  I guess she'll eat anything disguised as chocolate.

review/summary: Lesson Learned plus a recipe...
review/text: I made VitaMuffins in a muffin top pan with some oil spray which garnered eleven muffins following the per cup instructions.  The cooking time was reduced to about 16 or 17 minutes using this method in my stove.<br /><br />As these are a low calorie "diet" muffin I didn't have unrealistic expectations about flavor but still found them a bit bland straight out of the oven. It left me wondering what was with all the hype? I put the remaining muffins in the freezer and found that after trying another they were better tasting frozen with the addition of a little help from two teaspoons of Trader Joe's Organic Chocolate Moo syrup and low calorie whipped cream; much more flavorful, a treat...TJ's Choc flav syrup is delicious.<br /><br />But I had some some ..err... grumbling stomach issues in the hours after eating the muffins. I don't eat a whole lot of diet processed foods, especially the newer ones, so I didn't connect my symptoms to the innocuous seeming VitaMuffin the first time.  I didn't know anything about Erythritol, a sugar alcohol that can cause gastrointestinal upset for some people; but I have learned. And yes, I know, the ingredients are clearly listed on the product page here. Caveat emptor! to me. I can't rate VitaMuffins beyond "I don't like it" in any case.  I'm passing on my left-over muffins and mixes to my sister who doesn't have these sensitivities.  Even without my adverse reaction I wouldn't consider these something worth a repeat purchase.

review/summary: Great Buy and Delicious to Boot!
review/text: If you've been purchasing the frozen packs of Vitatops from the grocery store this will be a welcome surprise.  I bought this along with a whoopie pie pan, followed baking instructions kindly posted by an earlier review and just love them.  Wrapped in waxed paper, popped into a freezer bag and ready when needed at far less cost than buying prepared.  Buying through Subscribe and Save saves another 15%.  As somebody trying to lose weight, these are a great low calorie, low WW point treat.  OK, confession, a bit of peanut butter spread onto the top puts them over the edge.

review/text: These muffins are very good for a low calorie muffin.  I did<br />use whole eggs instead of egg whites which adds a few calories<br />but not that much when divided between 12 muffins. Some say<br />they only got 11 muffins, but mine easily made 12; maybe it<br />was the egg yolks that made the difference. Very filling,<br />so now I'll try the blueberry.

review/text: These chocolate muffins are "yummy".  I make them and freeze them to eat whenever we like.  I use whole eggs instead of egg whites which makes them more"fattening" but not so much and I make them in a Texas size muffin tin so there are only six in my batch.  But that's okay because there are only two of us.  If you want to try chocolate muffins these are the ones to try.

I know they're full of vitamins so it's not as if they taste like a full-fat bakery item--which is just fine by me.  I save them for the end of the day so I feel like I am having a little chocolate cake after dinner.

review/summary: There are better alternatives out there than these pears
review/text: I have been trying many of the dried fruits from this seller. Some are better than other, and these pears are a little on the less good side. They are a bit gritty and not very flavorful. The dried peaches, for example, from the same seller are much better. These pears are not chewy or tough enough to make them appealing from that aspect, so the gritty texture and lack of flavor stands out. The shipping rates charged by the seller are very high, and unless you buy in quantity the rates are too high to make it worthwhile to shop from this seller. I always put together a larger order of a variety of things from this seller to reduce the shipping costs enough to not be off the charts.

review/text: This is my first experience purchasing and using dried pears since I live in a place where specialty items like this are not easily found.  This is the best price available of the varieties offered on Amazon, and the company responds immediately, with low shipping charges.<p>The product is unsulphered, which may be prefered by some.  Its texture is tough.  Its flavor is present but muted, rather like canned pears.  That said, when braised in a little chicken broth, the dried pears perked up and did what they were supposed to do in a wild rice pilaf dish.  I'll definitely soak them before adding to breads or cookies.<p>The next time I order, though, I may try Melissa's, to compare quality.

review/summary: Java took a back seat to this fine tea
review/text: About 3 years ago I was intrigued with all health benefits associated with green tea.<br /><br />I decided to give it a whirl.<br /><br />I should mention that since my late teens I had been a drip (black)coffee lover (no cream or sugar the stronger the better).<br /><br />I started out with the usual Safeway green tea brands...Bigelow, Stack,  etc... and while the tea was o.k. and I began slowly replacing my usual 10 cups of java a day with the green tea I was concerned about the price....20 tea bags for about an average of 3  bucks.<br /><br />One day I walked into an asian supermarket here in Seattle and found a green tea I had never tried before...Stassen Jasmine Green Tea.<br /><br />I always thought there was nothing like the smell of fresh brewed coffee in the morning ...and I still treasure that aroma..but now I enjoy  Stassen Jasmine Green Tea and how its delicate aroma is part of the enjoyment of sipping this health laden beverage.<br /><br />Never thought coffee would take the back seat to tea (I still have one cup of black coffee every afternoon so that we remain friends though not as close as we once were) but that's what this wonderful Stassen Jasmine Green Tea has done to me.<br /><br />I drink a lot of it.  I feel less jittery. It doesn't have that acidy thing about it like coffee and I just feel flat out more healthy drinking it.  And I never tire of inhaling that captivating jasmine with every cup I pour.<br />I also find the 100 bag box of Stassen Jasmine Green Tea a far better value than what Safeway has to offer.

review/summary: Best tasting Jasmine Tea in US
review/text: Being originally from Taipei Taiwan, I'm puzzled over the years by the bland, below expectation Jasmine tea in the restaurants, from the Chinese grocery stores etc. It's like nobody take this popular tea seriously in the US. Sure, I enjoy my Oolong tea(from Nantou, Taiwan) tremendously, but sometimes nothing beats the pleasing, lingering aroma of Jasmine steaming up from the white porcelain cup ... IF you can find the right tea ... to me, that sure was memory afar. Then last week, someone placed a few tea bags in our Buddhist temple in Dallas, I picked one up, made the tea in a foam cup (shame on me), sipped it and immediately I reached for the tag that was dangling by the cup ... "Stassen", wow, this tea has the right combination of Jasmine fragrance and smooth green tea, my search is over. While waiting for my order to arrive, I can't help sniffing at the foam cup from time to time(shame on me twice).

I tried plain green tea and almost wretched - I thought it was bland and boring.<br /><br />My boyfriend and I recently went to a restaurant where they used this as the 'hot tea' option. I stole the tag and went looking.  Luckily, I found it at the local asian market - where it is only $4.80 for a box of 100 - double bonus!! Found the tea, and at a great price.  Needless to say, bf and I finished a box in less than a month.<br /><br />The perfect marriage of jasmine scent and flavor with green tea. Add a touch of honey if you prefer and enjoy!

review/text: If my dog could review this product, she'd give it 5 stars. She obviously loves the bacon flavor and being a very licky puppy, this is a real treat for her. As the pet owner, I like that she seems so content with the product, but it's a non-traditional way of delivering a treat and seems a bit awkward. The treat is given through a roll-on ball, like the old deodorants. With little treat bites, you can reward a dog with one or two nibbles, but regulating the number of licks or the time they're allowed to lick doesn't work so well. For training purposes, I wouldn't recommend this product, but just for gratuitous treat giving, I think it's just fine.

review/summary: my dog didn't get it
review/text: My dog is small and loves loves treats. But treats she can toss in the air and run around with. She couldn't get the idea this was just a taste. She really thought at some point I would give up and give her the bottle. I am passing it on to a friend who is trying to train her dog not to pull on the leash. I realize this is a training tool but my dog didn't seem to think so. She did like the taste.

review/summary: Smells Super; Our Dogs Have no Taste Appreciation
review/text: I reluctantly give this a 3 due mainly to the smell of the Liver Flavor.  The sole purpose of the product is to offer a flavorful break from the ordinary dog food flavors they normally receive but alas both picky Yorkies refused on several occasions to even take a good whiff.  They love freeze dried livers from chickens, beef, pig and lamb but cannot stand Lickety Stik.  Just to test the situation I tried the Stik first and it was a resounding NO.  Then after they had freeze dried livers and again it was NO.  I took their favorite dry food and applied a small amount on several pieces and mixed them in with untreated food.  They literally segregated the morsels into edible and Stiks.  The Stiks did not get touched while the unflavored were eaten with vigor.  Determined to prove that the Yorkies are just picky I offered a few licks to the neighbor's Retriever and he looked at me as if I am the fool I am.  Success did not open its heart on several days ago nor did it when I tried one more time with the same negative results.  I cannot say that any of the other flavors have any similar aspects since I only received the one container.  Bottom line:  Human Rating: 3  Dog Rating: 1 too many.  Sorry but the effort was there.

review/summary: Our Six Dogs LOVE The Lickety Stik!!!
review/text: Our six dogs (four of our own, plus two foster dogs) all LOVE getting their "licks" from this Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik!!!  They are all medium to big dogs (Boxer mixes, Pit Bull mix, Black Lab mix , Plott Hound & Greyhound mix) and they all come a-runnin' when I pull the bottle out.  Even Mollie, our finicky-eater Black Lab mix, loves it.  Sometimes, they try to take a bite, but they all quickly figure out that the trick is to lick the little roll-on-deodorant-type ball.  The key, of course, is to hold the bottle while the dogs help themselves, as opposed to giving them the bottle to do with what they please...  ;o)<br /><br />The bottom line is the Bacon Flavored Lickety Stik gets a unanimous "Four Paws Up" from my test panel!  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Interesting way to "treat" your dog!
review/text: I have to say this is an unusual product.  It's made on the same order as a deodorant and the dog licks the roller to get the flavoring.  We got the liver flavor and all the dogs loved it.  In fact, there was some times when two dogs were trying to lick the roller at the same time since they can't seem to wait their turn.  It's definitely something to try...don't know how well it would do training your dog instead of the regular treats, though.  It'll probably get gross after a few lickings too but a damp paper towel should fix it up...especially if you wipe it after the dog uses it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't comment if it really tastes like liver flavor.  The dog's aren't talking but they definitely seem to like it...<br /><br />Oh yeah, and its made in the USA!

review/summary: Interesting Idea - Little Dogs Loved It
review/text: Well, the title says it all.  The little dogs of the household loved this interesting twist on the traditional treat.  They did not seem to understand why they were not allowed to walk off with it, but they grasped the concept eventually.  Often traveling with our two smallest poms, this "roll-on" style treat is a simple, non messy, non-poop-inducing alternative to traditional treats.  It is "just enough" when you want to reward them without having to worry about making a mess in the car.  I am not sure if this concept will catch on with the mainstream, but as long as it is competitively priced, I can see this being a useful tool for many dog-rearing activities.  While we are far past that stage, I can see this being helpful for different training activities as well.  Bring yourself and your dog "outside of the bubble" and give this new treat a try.

review/summary: One weird idea
review/text: Can you imagine how this product came to fruition?  It seems like an accident.  Like the guys in R&D accidentally filled some roll-on deodorant tubes with dog food flavoring.  Or maybe it was a large-scale Big Lots-style buy where the guys at the pet food factory got an incredibly great deal when a Ban roll-on factory got flooded and had to unload a warehouse.<br /><br />In any event, what seems like a really weird idea is...well, a really weird idea that our dog LOVES.  Of course there's not much nutritional value to letting your dog take a few slurps off the end of a liver-flavored roll-on doggie treat, but hey, there's not much nutritional value to that rawhide toy you just bought him either.  Give this a try for dessert.

review/text: When I first saw this I wasn't to sure but I love to give my pups new things to try. When it came in I checked it out....it looks like a roll on deodorant. I had to laugh but then came the taste test. I think my dogs are in love with this! We have small dogs...all less than 6lbs and I have to roll the ball for them to get more flavor so it's not so bad but I imagine that larger dogs can roll the ball themselves. If you're looking for something new and different then you may want to give this one a try!

review/summary: Doggie "crack"....Lol!
review/text: I ordered this, not sure if my dogs would like the roller ball or turn their noses up at it, but I'm happy to report they loved it! They went at it with gusto-so much so that I had to put it away after only a few licks-afraid they might make themselves sick. Little did I know that my little monsters would find a way to knock it off the shelf & absolutely destroy the bottle while I was at the grocery store. I came home to a shredded bottle & 2 pomeranians with very guilty looks on their faces.....<br />I think this is a great product & if the reaction of my dogs is any indication-so do they. I will definitely be ordering more when it becomes available, but might have to invest in a lock box to keep it in....lol!

review/summary: loved it
review/text: I have the most picky dog in the world.  She's a big dog, which usually means they'll eat anything, but not my dog, so when I got her the Likety Stik, I honestly didn't think she'd like it, but she loved it!  And what a great training tool.  Rather than fill your pocket with treats,(that usually go through the wash) you have a neat, no fuss way to reward them.<br /><br />I did have to squeeze it to get the liquid moving along after she'd licked it, and it dripped onto her pure white, newly bathed ruff, but it came off with just water, so no worries.<br /><br />I then took the Stik over to my in-laws to give to their obese King Charles spaniel, and he of course loved it, because he eats anything.  What they liked was being able to give him treats that didn't add to his weight problem.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a great new way of treating your dog.  Whoever came up with it is a genius.  I'm going to buy every flavor for my dog, and one for my in-laws dog.

review/summary: Roller Jams, Wasted Product
review/text: The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism.

review/summary: Lily LIKED It!!
review/text: My little diabetic shih-tzu, Lily, is notorious for hating anything new. I am constantly on the search for healthy new treats that I can give her after she has her insulin shot (every 12 hours...ugh!) I received the Liver flavor Lickety Stik and was prepared to donate it to the local animal shelter because I was just sure Lily would turn up her nose to it. Lo and behold...she liked it! It took a minute or two for her to figure out how to get the treat out and I squeezed the bottle too hard and some dripped on the floor, but Lily quickly lapped it up. I don't think the ball turned very easily, but she was determined to try to get the treat-juice out of the bottle. I think this is a great idea, but I am only giving it 4 stars because the packaging was hard to read and the ball didn't seem to turn very readily.

review/text: The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.<br />We get more on our hands then our Golden gets in his mouth.<br />When we try to turn the ball for our dog, even we find it difficult.<br /><br />The roller BALL is a concern, we don't consider it 'pet safe'.<br />If our Golden Retriver got this bottle,<br />he could easily bite this roller ball out and would try to eat it.<br /><br />The ball requires a strong tounge to move it, even at that it gets stuck.<br />We can't imagine this stik being at all compatible with small dogs.<br />If you squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out around the ball<br />most of that drops to the ground between licks.<br /><br />This would be a great idea if it worked, and was truely 'pet safe'.

review/summary: Great Idea- My dog loves it.
review/text: I have one dog, Rex, a Shepherd/Lab mix and he absolutely loves the Lickety Stik. Now if he sees me get it out, he automatically sits or gives me his paw. So cute.<br /><br />This is a great new idea for doggy treats. Especially when walking my dog- I've gotten tired of carrying a bag of treats for him. And new ideas are always welcome, I don't want to overfeed my dog with other treats... They can get expensive because he's allergic to almost everything.<br /><br />So the lickety sticks come in three flavors- liver, chicken and bacon. Rex loved each one. The container that holds the liquid treat is a roller... I saw another reviewer describe it like a deodorant stick with a roller. That is exactly what the case is like. Unfortunately the liquid doesn't just come out when the ball is licked, the bottle has to be squeezed for your dog. My roller gets stuck if I don't squeeze or push it with my finger.<br /><br />I highly suggest trying this item out, great alternative to milk bones :)

review/summary: Great Idea for Dispensing Dog Treats
review/text: Really like the idea of a roller-ball to give treats, especially as rewards when training (skateboard, leash walking and close commands).  The dispenser is similar to a roll-on deodorant design.  Lickety Stik is a healthy all natural (according to the ads) liquid containing vitamins and low in calories in several flavors. The dispenser contains over 500 licks.  A no mess way to give rewards plus it carries the made in the USA with all-natural ingredients.  My English Bulldog puppy loves the stuff (liver flavor); however, it also comes in chicken and bacon flavors. Following  is a list for those who read the ingredients,  1)natural liver flavors, (2) cultured milk, (3) lecithin, (4) mixed tocopherols (natural preservative- a source of vitamin E), (5) scorbyl palmitate (source of vitamin C), (6) rosemary extract, (7) green tea extract.  A caution about dogs allergic to chicken - they should not be licking this stuff. Unlike most treats, the shelf life is 18 months and "best" licked by date is stamped on the bottom of the roll-on dispenser. The description indicates the Lickety Stik formula contains antimicrobial agents - basically no germ transfer. The stuff does not have to be refrigerated.  Naturally, you must shake the dispenser often.  Will be ordering the Lickety Stik 3 pack with all flavors from Amazon.  "Reilly" recommends the treat!

review/summary: Great, low-cal training treat.
review/text: I had to give the ball a partial turn to get some of the liquid on it after shaking to mix it up, but after I did that my dog licked away and loved it! This is a good low-cal treat for dogs and would be great as a training aid. Our dog dutifully performed her repertoire of tricks to get more of the treat, and then followed me back to the kitchen as I put it away. The only bad thing is that you DO have to hold it for the dog, but if you're using it as a training aid that may actually be an advantage.<br /><br />There are over 500 licks in each tube and 10 licks is only 1 calorie. I gave my dog 10 licks per trick.<br /><br />FWIW, my dog is a 1.5 year old hound dog/bird dog mutt.

review/summary: Good for a go around, but probably not the staple snack for Charlie
review/text: The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're "healthier;" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that.

review/summary: My dogs love it, even if it is funny looking
review/text: PetSafe Lickety Stik is a weird looking dispenser full of a delicious liquid treat my pooches are crazy about.  The strange design is slightly bigger than a deoderant bottle and the dogs get their treat by licking the roll-on ball!<br /><br />I own Wonderland Kennels, with 7 Boston Terriers and German Shepherds that I train and compete with.  Even the picky ones love this stuff.  The bottle is small, but it goes a loooong way because the pups are only getting a little at a time, instead of a larger treat.<br /><br />Pacino and Molly (German Shepherds) first instincts were to try to bite down on the dispenser, but it didn't crack and is still holding up fine.  They quickly learned to just lick it, though the best way to introduce it to larger dogs is to hold it completely upside-down so the angle makes it easier to lick and harder for them to grab.<br /><br />I'm honestly surprised by how big a hit this little Lickety Stik is with my pups, and how long the bottle lasts.  Maizy, Molly, Gracie, Pixi, Einstein, Pacino, and Isabelle each give it four paws up!  :)

review/text: When I received this "Lickety Stik", I really wasn't sure what to expect with my dog.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about - he is CRAZY about it.  If I even go near the bottle he starts wagging his tail and giving me the excited look.  One aspect about this doohickey I really like is that you can use it as a reward for your pet, without constantly having to give him a biscuit or similar treat; just a lick off the Lickety Stik will do the trick!  The occasional biscuit and treat is okay, but this is much better for active training.  Highly recommend, though you may want to shy away from trying it yourself.

The container is 5" tall and approx. 1 1/2" around and easily fit right in my jeans pocket, so this would be very easy to take on a walk. I could also see that this might be helpful if you happen to have a dog who won't eat - you could roll the liquid around the edge of his bowl and it may entice him to eat.

review/summary: An innovative invention much appreciated by canines
review/text: with the exception of my senior chihuahua that viewed the container of Lickety Stik as possibly a lethal weapon and, not wishing to take any chances, tore out of the room when she saw it for under-the-bed protection.<br /><br />"Oh well," I said, "I've got three other dogs.  Let's try them."  At first my toy bichon-poodle was also wary and stepped back.  But when she saw my shepherd and chow chow growing very excited and thrilled by this new offering, she relented and tasted some herself.  It was a decided hit.<br /><br />There are no directions on the small plastic container as to how to use, so I was uncertain if I should squeeze it and, if so, how tightly.  I quickly learned that squeezing it too firmly causes the liquid to pour out so, if squeezed, "lightly" should be the watchword.  I would advise the first time trying it to place a paper towel under the container until one gets the hang of manipulating the small plastic bottle and administering the treat to the dog(s), which will not be a problem as my two large dogs, and eventually the smaller one, just kept wanting to lick and lick and keep on licking.  They found this new-found gadget to be very exciting.<br /><br />What is most appealing about it to me is that it contains all natural ingredients - nothing artificial.  They consist of natural flavors, cultured milk, lecithin, rosemary extract and green tea extract.  It also contains Vitamin A.<br /><br />So this is a fun way to make your dog(s) happy, small enough to carry in your pocket, light enough for easy carrying.  Now I've only used it once, but I predict that the next time my dogs (chihuahua excepted) see me holding the by now familiar container, there'll be a stampede of sorts.  Just like in television commercials.<br /><br />Tail waggin' good!

review/summary: I think this is an unsafe product
review/text: Do you know those Tootsie Pop commercials where they'd see how many times the Tootsie Pop could be licked before they'd chew right into it?  That's how this Likety Stik worked with my dog.  He licked it three or four times, then immediately wanted to chew on the roller.  I repeatedly pulled it out each time he'd try, but it kept repeating.  Lick, lick, lick, chew.  Lick, lick, lick chew.  Within one minute, no exaggerating, he had chewed off the end and I was scared to death that he'd swallow the roll ball. Fortunately he spit it out, but if he had swallowed it, he easily could have choked to death on it with it blocking his windpipe.  I would never buy this product again, and highly recommend others not to.  Seriously, it was completely chewed through in one minute of opening the package.

review/summary: Fun Idea
review/text: This is a nice idea for a low calorie dog treat.<br /><br />It looks just like a roll-on antiperspirant, and you have to roll the ball to get it going. One problem is that this is a syrup or other liquid that is pretty sticky and I usually have to get the ball rolling myself each time. Also, once I offer it to my dogs they can get one lick but cannot get the ball moving.<br /><br />The other problem I've had is my dogs want to take the whole thing, not just lick the surface of it. They seem to like the taste because they really grab the whole thing.<br /><br />I think it's a fun idea and it does seem to taste great to them, though I wouldn't really recommend it because of the ball being hard for dogs to roll. (in my experience)

review/summary: Dog was a fan, but I wasn't
review/text: I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who loves all sorts of treats so I'm always on the lookout for new products. Unfortunately, many doggie treats have gotten a bit pricey these days if you plan on giving them a helping. When the PetSafe Lickety Stik (essentially the same design as a roll-on deodorant) popped up on Amazon Vine I naturally snatched one up right away. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Low in calories, 1 per 10 licks.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Container has a re-sealable cap.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Fluid can drip out of roller ball and leave a sticky residue on surfaces.<br /><br />- Container is not really pet safe if the dog gets ahold of the treat.  Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br /><br />- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br /><br />- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently.

review/summary: Potentially messy but my dog loves it.
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>Lickety Stik is a lickable (vs. edible) dog treat that comes in a variety of flavors, such as bacon, liver and chicken.  The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you're not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).  She whines for it sometimes several times a day (she knows where I keep it).  However, she has a sensitive stomach and I have had to switch over to predominantly allergy-formula food and treats to reduce (and almost eliminate) the frequency of her spit-ups.  The day after I gave her the first taste of Lickety Stik, she spit up for the first time in a few months.  Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is "All-Natural with Vitamins," that there is only "1 calorie in every 10 licks" and that there are "over 500 licks per bottle."  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don't want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.  I've been using it about a week.

review/summary: Interesting Dog Treat
review/text: My family has two chihuahuas. I tried the dog treat on the two of them today and got different reactions. The largest chihuahua liked it and the smallest chihuahua did not. This is par to the course and people like different things too.<br /><br />The treat is a liquid that taste like liver. It can be rolled easily anywhere you desire. All you have to do is take the top off and squeeze the sides of container. It is easy to use. It certianly is a new concept as I have always thought of dog treats as something solid.<br /><br />I would recommend it for any dog owner. If you have any questions, ask at this email!

review/summary: Not so great says my dog
review/text: This is a pretty neat concept, rewarding your dog with licks rather than treats, to cut down calorie consumption.  However, it's only good if your dog likes it.  Mine doesn't.  To be fair, he's 8 years old and set in his ways.

review/summary: Rich bacon smell
review/text: This item seems like a great idea...a convenient, and non-messy way to carry treats for the dog.  It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.<br /><br />I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.<br /><br />This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.  Perhaps you could "train" older dogs to use it properly, but it is certainly NOT worth the effort to do that.

review/summary: Our dog's opinions
review/text: We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary.

review/summary: Novel idea, but needs work
review/text: I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is "Smoky Bacon"<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the "no mess" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only "outside" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product.

review/summary: Three dogs -- not much interest
review/text: I tried this on three dogs, a border collie, a weiner dog, and a little taco dog. Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors. However, the weiner dog (who has no other known allergies) was clearly allergic to this product -- she sneezed every time she licked it so I gave her no more. She has never sneezed like this before.<br /><br />In summary, with all the treats that are available for dogs these days, even though this one is a low-calorie type, I would pass it by. It seems like a good idea but in actuality, I'm pretty sure that you'll be seeing this product on the sale table at Big Lots before too long.

review/summary: My dog liked it, I didn't.
review/text: I usually try to see the good side of things so I'll start with  - my dog liked the taste.  She is an older dog and it takes a lot to get her excited, this did.  As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy.

review/summary: Two Out of Three Agree!
review/text: I have three dogs. Two of them loved it, one so much that she tried to swallow the whole bottle, or run away with it and rip into it as she might a bone. They were definitely confused by it, they weren't sure what to do with it, but once they caught the smell of bacon they couldn't get enough. The third wasn't so keen on it, but I feel like that was more because he was abused before we took him in and he doesn't like something being held in front of his face like you have to do with this treat. I did eventually get him to try some, but after one lick he refused anymore, I will attribute this to his fear rather than any misgivings he might've had about taste as he eats everything.<br /><br />I think this would work better if you have just one dog. When you pass out treats or food, sometimes squabbles can happen, and that definitely happens here when you're focus is on just one dog and the others get jealous. Also, dogs generally do prefer to grab their treat then be able to go, take it somewhere and spend some time with it, maybe hide it for later, can't really do that with this.<br /><br />This is also drippy, so be careful or you could end up with a bit of a mess.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well this would work for training though. I would probably stick with regular treats for that, but if anyone can test that, please comment and let us know if it worked!<br /><br />Edit: I noticed that my dogs try to go after pill bottles now because the bottles kind of looks like the tube (have a similar shape) so if you get this, might want to watch out for that.

review/summary: New fun treat
review/text: My dog loves this treat. She loves the taste of it and I like that it lasts a while. Other treats just do not last long with her including rawhides but with the Lickety Stik she gets approx 500 licks. She goes nuts every time I go to twist the top off of it and doesn't stop licking until I finally say that she's had enough. With any dog treat some dogs may not like it but I think it's worth a try to purchase Lickety Stik for your dog at least one time. I have found one problem with this treat which is the roller ball doesn't roll so well sometimes. It gets to one point where my dog licks it and it stops turning which annoys her and annoys me as well because I have to get my hands all messy trying to fix the roller. This is the only gripe I have with this treat but it is also why I deducted one star from the overall review.

review/summary: I question its value
review/text: My two dogs do love this product.  The dumb one found it confusing for only a few seconds, and then began licking it happily.<br /><br />The product is physically similar to roll-on deodorant.  The plastic ball works well, and will last the duration of the product.<br /><br />The product doesn't last very long in my experience.  Because the dog is not getting anything to chew, and you are not reaching into a bag of treats, I think most will see a tendency to let the dog get several good licks in.<br /><br />If you're very interested in weight loss without loosing rewards, I suppose this is a clever solution.  Otherwise, this simply is not the best value compared to many other options.

Just whip it out of your pocket and give your dog a lick.  No where on the product did I see the shelf life or how to store it.  I'm assuming it does not need to be refrigerated.  It looks just like a roll-on deodorant bottle.  It's just liver flavored gravy in a deodorant bottle. It's dispensed when the dog licks the ball.  I got the liver flavor. I don't see this lasting very long.  It's a small bottle.  There is a little "window" at the bottom of the bottle so you can see when it's almost empty.<br /><br />I could see these being used for treats in training.  "Chester" says it's great!

review/summary: great idea, but the roller ball is hard to roll
review/text: I only have i bottle (bacon flavor), so I don't know if it is typical, but the ball does not roll easily.  My dogs can get the liquid treat, but only if I squeeze the tube a bit.  And they aren't small dogs with weak tongues.  They are a Border Collie and a Labrador Retriever.  They do enjoy the treat, thought the Border Collie is not overly enthusiastic.  The Lab is enthusiastic about anything edible, even remotely, edible.  A bit messy as it drips a little when I squeeze it, but then it's not meant to have to be squeezed.  I will check other reviews and if my hard-to-move roller ball is the exception, I will be ordering more of this handy, portable treat which is easy to keep mess-free in a pocket.
