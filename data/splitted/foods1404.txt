review/summary: SALTY
review/text: Maybe I have gotten accusttomed to a very low salt diet, but this product made breaded chicken (and later catfish) that was far too salty for me to eat. I diluted the flour with 50% corn flour for the catfish (Swai) and still couldn't enjoy it. Normally I give unsuccessful experiments to the dogs (they seem to love whatever I cook), but I didn't think this much salt was good for them either (they would have loved it anyway).<br /><br />I question if the 'salty' flavor is really salt or some other seasoning that tastes salty. Regardless, I probably will toss out the unused product. Maybe I have gotten too accustomed to low salt diets?<br /><br />Domata's other products have been terrific!!

review/summary: Best I Have Ever Seen!
review/text: I am a big fan of star anise.  I use it mostly in sauces and gravies, and I have always loved the flavor it brings.  Normally I buy it in an "upscale" grocery store across town, since the standard grocery stores near me do not carry it.  I have always been happy with the product I have been using, but I figured I'd poke around online to see what I could find.  Normally, it costs me $4.99 for a 0.60 ounce jar.  The Frontier Star Anise cost me less than $14.00 for a 16 ounce bag, so I figured I'd give it a try.  I didn't realize how much 16 ounces of star anise would be!  There really is a bunch of stars in this bag, and most of them are whole stars.  The truly surprising part about it for me was the quality.  Each star is easily twice the size of the stars I have been using, and now I realize my normal stock is actually shriveled up.  These are huge and very fragrant...I actually need to change my recipes to use less or else they will be overpowering.  Now, I don't know for sure if I'll be able to use all 16 ounces of them before they need to be replaced, but for the price (at this price, I would only get 1.8 ounces of shriveled up stars from my normal supplier) and the difference in quality, I would definitely recommend these and I will most certainly purhcase them again.

review/summary: Product and quality varies with the seller
review/text: I've ordered this twice, once when fulfilled by Amazon, and the other by a private seller, "Smart Styles".  Depending on who fulfills the order, you will get variations in product quality. While I am very happy with the product I received from Amazon, I have some reservations about the product I received from Smart Styles.  To keep things simple, safe, and timely, I recommend only ordering this when fulfilled by Amazon.<br /><br />When fulfilled by Amazon, you will receive a sealed, branded bag of Chinese origin, distributed through a California based food distributor and shipped same or next day from Amazon's warehouse.  It has nutritional information and all of the other tidbits of information that one would expect from a product that goes through some sort of quality control procedure.  The majority of the star anise fruits were whole stars, as advertised, albeit most of the fruits were not seed bearing.  Very good quality star anise.<br /><br />On the other hand, when fulfilled by Smart Styles, you will be in for a wait and a shock.  I placed my order on December 13th, when it was advertised as being "In Stock", and then I got an Estimated Ship Date of January 6th - February 2nd after they charged my order and claimed it was "Shipped".  Advertising something as "In Stock" but then not having it arrive until nearly a month later is misleading.  I only received my order on January 9th.  It came as a parcel, shipped from India, poorly packaged and not sealed from the elements.  While they shipped more than 16oz, it was in a taped bag (not even a Ziploc type), surrounded by bubble wrap, and then shipped in a cardboard envelope.  It was very beat up when I received it.  The majority of the stars were broken and there was a lot of detritus (stems, dried leaves) included in the package. It's almost as if it was scooped right out of an open air market stall!  This might be very off putting for a lot of people, and leave them with dirt/bug anxiety.  Luckily though, the Indian star anise I received was actually fresher than the Chinese star anise that was fulfilled by Amazon.<br /><br />I have uploaded pictures as a comparison.<br /><br />In use, both of the star anise shipments I received provided the robust flavorings I was looking for.  I've used it for pho, bread, meat seasoning, and tea so far.  Star anise is an under-appreciated spice in the US, but can be used for so many things.  It's a blessing to be able to buy so much of it on Amazon, for such a low price.  Buying this spice from a grocer is very expensive, and while 16oz is quite a bit, once you understand the flavors this spice can impart, you'll find many uses for it.  I actually keep a spare pepper grinder on hand to pulverize raw spices like this, as it can make it very convenient for seasoning meats (star anise can really boost pork/carnitas!).  For larger volumes of pulverized star anise, I would recommend a coffee grinder.  To store and maintain maximum freshness, I recommend keeping these in vacuum sealed 1/2 gallon Ball jars, as the 16oz of star anise fills it perfectly.

I am happy to say it is "illicium verum" or Chinese Star anise.<br /><br />Please note that Japanese star anise (shikimi/I. anisatum) and (Florida anise/I. floridanum) are known toxic.<br /><br />I gave this product four stars because so many of the pods do not contain seeds. I still throw them in my tea & they give a nice flavor, but my guess is that the flavor would be stronger if the pods still contained the seeds. Still, I am quite happy with this purchase.

review/summary: Useful for many dishes
review/text: Star anise imparts food with a flavor that speaks of barbecue shops in Chinatown everywhere.  Here is a nice recipe for Soy Sauce Chicken.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />1 whole chicken 3-3 1/2 lbs, rinse and remove fat from cavity - never frozen, all natural is best.  If you go over 3+ lbs it gets harder to judge the cooking time; discard giblets or reserve for other use<br />2 cups water<br />1/2 cup sugar<br />1/2 cup 'black' soy sauce - this is an item you need to find in an Asian specialty shop<br />2 tbs 'thin' soy sauce - same as above; you can use regular soy sauce from a grocery store in a pinch, but it won't be as good<br />1piece star anise<br />1.tsp peppercorns (Szechuan is best but black is OK)<br />1 cinnamon stick (Chinese is best but generic is OK)<br />2-3 stalks green onion<br /><br />1.  Take small cooking pot large enough to hold the chicken.  Put in chicken.  Add water, both soy sauces, sugar and green onion.<br />2.  In a tea ball place star anise, cinnamon and peppercorns.  You can also improvise a spice bag with cheese cloth.  I also sometimes just dump them in without a bag.  Add to pot.<br />3.  Cover pot.<br />4.  Put on stove burner and medium to medium low heat.  Bring to a light simmer (check this often;at a vigorous boil the chicken will be over cooked.<br />5.  Simmer 20 min, flip chicken and simmer 20 more minutes; essentially you are poaching the chicken.<br />6.  Chicken is done when juices from between thigh and body run clear when pierced with a chop stick.<br />7.  Cut chicken into pieces and serve with steamed rice.<br />The cooking sauce can be served with the chicken for the rice, or reserved and used to cook up to 2 more chickens.

review/text: Amazon offers a great deal on this. At the Celtic Sea Salt site, you have to pay $7 for shipping, which brings their price for the 5 lb bag up to $29.50 so Amazon's price is still the cheapest I've found so far.<br /><br />Celtic sea salt livens up any food. Wait until you taste an heirloom tomato sprinkled with this. :)<br /><br />TIP: The salt arrives rather moist. Transfer some of it to a clay pot, or a glass jar, and leave uncovered for a few days. When the salt dries up, run it through a spice grinder and you'll have the most wonderful flaky sea salt to use on tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, salads, etc.

review/text: This is the best price I have seen for Selina Naturally Celtic Sea Salt. One taste of this salt and you will never buy the over-processed, chemically-tasting table salt again. It brings out the natural flavor of foods without tasting "salty". I love that it provides trace minerals missing from our modern, "civilized" diets. I go to a lot of trouble providing wholesome, fresh, healthy meals for my family. I'd hate to ruin them with inferior ingredients like grocery store, iodized salt. I did a lot of research on different types of salt and was torn between the pink Himalayan salt and the gray Celtic Sea salt. I think either would probably be ok but felt this salt held a slight edge as it tends to be less expensive.<br /><br />Helpful Notes: This salt arrives in a large, sealed plastic bag. It is rather moist, but that is no problem. I prefer to buy the coarse ground purely because of the price. I use this salt in three ways: in a sea salt grinder for the table, finer ground for baking, and naturally coarse for cooking. For the grinder, I highly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OWA338">Kyocera Ceramic Fine Mill, White Top</a>, which I also purchased from Amazon. It handles this moist, course salt beautifully and never clogs or rusts, even in the humid South. No need for drying, just fill up the grinder with salt straight from the bag. For baking, I lay out some salt on a baking sheet to dry a bit, then grind it in a spice grinder. I then store it in a small glass jar. For general cooking, I like to use a salt cellar that I keep next to the stove. I just grab a pinch or spoonful as I need it. It dries out naturally a bit as it sits. I store the remaining salt in a large glass jar and take out what I need when I need it. I bought a 5 lb bag 4 months ago and at that time I filled the salt mill for the table, the salt cellar, and the jar for baking. I still have not yet refilled any of these containers, and we are a family of four with two teenage boys. This salt will last us a long time!<br /><br />I think a bag of this salt with the Kyocera salt mill would make a lovely wedding gift!

review/summary: Great for grilling
review/text: What a tasty and different treat this salt is!  I have been using it for about a year now and it is the only salt I use for grilling and cooking.  This salt is much stronger than normal salt so you have to take care at first not to overdo things.<br /><br />When used in grilling, I use it as part of my rubs.  The course grains slowly dissolve as the meat or vegetables are cooking, giving the dish a dice even salt spread.  It works so much better.  I use to use only Kosher salt for these rubs but have more or less replaced  the Kosher with this product.<br /><br />I do not serve it on the table as it will indeed muck up a salt grinder.  The few times I have used it, I have ground it up in a ceramic mortar bowel and severe it in small salt cellars.<br /><br />This is a good product and I am glad I started using the stuff.  As far as I can tell, this is a pretty good price it is being offered at here.

In the office I was drinking lots of water until realizing it was bottled and was low in "salts" but it meant low in sodium and low in many other minerals I was missing. I was drinking a lot of water and the trips to the restroom were also really frequent. So I started sprinkling some celtic sea salt on my glass and suddenly my thirst stopped and my restroom trips became less frequent. It's crazy how "they" are telling us to eat less sodium but it really means to eat less processed salt. Do yourself a favor, get your unprocessed mineral sea salt and you'll feel the difference. Salt is not creating hypertension, processed food, grains, breads and sugar is. Get your fresh food and sprinkle good quality salt on it.

review/summary: Celtic Sea Salt
review/text: Let me first say that this is the best tasting salt I've ever had. My girls and I decided to do a side by side comparison with the other salts I had in the cupboard. We did kosher, name brand processed sea salt, and regular iodized salt against the Celtic Sea Salt. The winner without a doubt was the Celtic Sea Salt. It's not as salty, and has no weird sea smell like other semi damp salts I've dried. It has a clean flavor, without the burning "salt" taste. After tasting the real stuff, the table salt tasted absolutely terrible. The processed sea salt was similar to the iodized, and the kosher tasted slightly better, just more salty. The 5lb. bag course is a lot cheaper than the ground version. I just bought a mortar and pestle and decided to just grind it myself. I can't wait to cook with it, especially for baking bread. Thanks to Richard Bertinet (author of the book Dough  [...]), I decided to research why he used French Sea Salt. I am so glad I did. I love the taste and so do the kids. My youngest daughter always wants salt and the salt aficionados say it's because her body is looking for the trace minerals that are found in the natural sea salt. I would highly recommend this to any who want to get away from the worthless, non nutritional stuff. As for it being wet, it's supposed to be like that. I just put it in my RSVP salt server, and wrap the rest of the bag up in a gallon zipper bag, and store in a cool dry place.

review/summary: OVERPRICED and OVERRATED!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!
review/text: This salt is only $22.95 from the manufacturer's website, celticseasalt . c o m , further more this website and this manufacturer is highly deceptive, and it is obvious by the comments on this website. all modern sea salt has significantly less trace minerals than ancient himalayan sea salt. the manufacturer provides a graph that seems to indicate this salt has more than 3 times the trace minerals, when all they are really comparing is the moisture content. you are paying for about 12% water when you buy this product by weight, which is about 3 times the amount of water in himalayan salt. himalayan salt forms an alkaline solution in water, due to its higher trace mineral content, while all modern sea salt forms acidic solutions. this salt does have a decent flavor, which i find goes well with fish, but for all other cooking, himalayan salt is both tastier and healthier. a lot of reviewers have been duped by the spurious and misleading information on the manufacturers website. this salt has a significantly lower ratio of trace minerals to sodium  than himalayan salt.

review/text: Celtic Sea Salt itself is wonderful. We have used it for years. I was very, very unhappy that I clicked on purchasing a 5# bag of salt as you can see for yourself. What I received was a half pound bag of salt. The company was willing to refund my money, but it would have cost me even more to return it than would have been refunded. I would never, ever trust this company again! Shopper beware!

review/summary: Selina Celtic Grey Salt - Fixed My Kidney Pain
review/text: This salt tastes delicious, as everyone else has said.  And no, it isn't cheap.<br /><br />However, for me at least, it's been so very helpful.  I've been on a low-carb diet for 5.5 years and after about 2 years I began experiencing pain in my right kidney.  I went to doctors multiple times and they all said my kidney function was completely normal.  This salt quite literally cured this painful condition for me.<br /><br />I don't know if it's specifically caused by the low-carb diet or more likely a combination of the low-carb diet (which may eliminate minerals we would typically get in processed foods), a lot of tea drinking, and the fact that at work I only have access to reverse osmosis water (which has the minerals removed).  Whatever may have caused it - the DAY AFTER I started using this type of salt my kidney pain was gone completely.  I was not expecting it to cure this, I started using the salt because of the minerals in it but had no clue that was what was causing my kidney pain.  In the several months since then the only time my kidney pain recurs I can always look back at the previous couple of days and see that I have not had my usual amount of this salt.<br /><br />If you have troublesome kidney pain that seems to have no other cause I would definitely try using a grey salt like this one.<br /><br />On a side note, I've had low blood-pressure for years and I've added about 1.5 teaspoons of this salt to my diet per day (besides what I was already ingesting in food). I experienced a VERY slight increase in my blood pressure, most likely "caused" by the salt.  By slight I mean a couple of points.  For me this has also been a blessing as I no longer feel faint upon standing (or at least on very rare occasions).

review/summary: Great Salt
review/text: There were a few complaints about excessive water content in this salt.  I dry my salt using a clay bar pan in my oven using just the light.  We have high humidity here in central Illinois.  After a day or two in the oven with periodic stirring it is dry enough to put in my grinder and I store the rest in a canister with a loose lid.  Curious about how much weight was water I weighed the salt before and after drying one time and did not see a signifcant difference.  My scale is not the most accurate but close enough to tell the water weight isn't that much of a consideration.  What with the price difference between the already dried and finely ground salt I'll stick with this one.  We have been using this salt for probably eight years and love it. Our chiropractor recommended it and we have never gone back.  The taste difference is really distinct.

Though $5 a pound is a lot for salt, I expect this 5 pound bag to last a very, very long time.

I have also tried a salt that was available (not celtic salt) that is suppose to have a lot of natural minerals and find it easier to use which also is just as good if not better. I also didn't pay 29.99 for it. I chalk it up for foolishness for paying that kind of money for salt. Thanks

review/text: I stumbled upon these honey drops in the dollar store and decided to try them.  I loved them so much I knew I needed to order them in bulk so that I would always have some on hand.  They are true to their name because their flavor is honey, they have a smooth outer shell which is easy to suck on.  The outer shell softens and releases real honey inside your mouth.  It is delicious.  They are not cough drops or medicine-tasting at all but they soothe your dry mouth and your throat (especially if you have a tickle that won't cough up).  Being a  teacher, public speaker and singer, I have found that these drops are helpful in keeping the mouth moist.  However, I love candy and I am happy to add these honey drops to my collection.  I keep some in my purse and in my coat pockets!

When I moved out to Oregon, I could not find these mints anywhere and I wanted them so I was very glad when I could finally find them on Amazon.<br /><br />They are more of a mild type of mint, especially compared to the peppermints that Lifesavers puts out. I suppose that I would not suggest them to anyone that doesn't care for a mint flavor. But, if you do like a mint flavor and you find some of the mints in the US too strong for you, then try these out.

review/summary: Tasty Dutch mints!
review/text: I grew up in a small town in Michigan with heavy Dutch roots, and one of my favorite Christmas traditions was when my Mom brought out the tin of Wilhelmina peppermints in December.  These mints are very different to your typical American breath mints - larger size, different texture, and milder taste.  Somehow they're pepperminty without being Menthol-y, and they have a slightly sweet aftertaste - with perhaps a hint of vanilla?  They're perfect for an after-dinner treat that freshens your breath without burning your tongue or totally shocking your taste buds...  Anyway, I hadn't had any in years and was delighted to find them on Amazon.  I bought some for my boyfriend to try, and he quickly became addicted to the "Christmas mints" and always keeps a baggie on hand!

review/summary: So many mints!
review/text: I don't care for peppermints, but my Dutch girlfriend grew up eating Wilhelmina peppermints and had been talking a lot about how she missed them, so I decided to find her some online! Since Amazon offers free shipping on this item (it was around $30 when I bought it) and any other website I found had such expensive shipping, it cost around $10 anywhere else to get 3.5 ounces of these things! Amazon offered 24x the amount of mints for only 3x the price so I decided to just go for it and buy the whole 12 pack. I didn't realize until it arrived its more than 5 pounds of mints! I am very pleased with the amount for the cost on Amazon.<br /><br />About the actual mints- The size surprised me- they were around the size of a quarter and fairly thick. For the taste- I don't like mints, so I'll give my girlfriend's opinion here. She says they are the best mints she's ever tried! I read the ingredients and the flavoring comes from pure peppermint oil- no artificial flavors, and the list of ingredients is short (generally the shorter the list the healthier and less processed stuff goes in it), so if you like mints these would be great to try. From my online research I have to say the smaller containers of mints generally have much cuter packaging(some are in a nice roll that looks sort of like a pack of rollos, and some are in tins with blue and white pictures of stereotypical dutch things like windmills-- these mints are just loose in bags). My girlfriend said the mints she's had in the past had the design imprinted in the center of the circle like a coin, but these were just plain round circles with the queen's head on it. These may not have the best packaging or the coolest design, but if you primarily care about the taste of the mints, these are by far the greatest deal!

review/text: I'm a part-time martial arts/fitness instructor w/ an atrociously busy schedule that's got me practically 'fighting' for blocks of time to sleep. Although I enjoy what I do, I admit that I get bogged down from constantly going from one program to another. Just yesterday a student of mine gave me a can of XS and since I'm not a huge proponent of energy drinks, I just placed it in my bag and told her that I'll try it at a later time. I usually find that I don't get the effects that most of the popular ones promise to give. And to add, I'm not a huge fan of the 'seltzer-like' taste of many of them. This morning I got up and had one of many grueling workouts, showered, ate and came to work at my full time job when 'low and behold' I started to get a case of drowsiness just sitting at my desk checking my daily emails. I figured I'll just chug the XS and 'when it doesn't work' I'll go get a cup of java....NOT!!!! Not only was I pleasantly surprised by the taste, I got an instant "jolt" from just taking one sip. I'm almost reluctant to finish the can because it might have me bouncing off the walls. I immediately called my student to let her know that this is the real deal and she informed me that's what XS is supposed to do as it's loaded w/ B vitamins! Needless to say I placed an order for a case. I just hope all the flavors are as good as the Electric Lemon Blast! LOL

Now that she has tried this sugar free version she is just as addicted but taking in less calories. I can't explain the reviewer who developed illness and thinks the candies are the cause. My wife has the most sensitive stomach and digestive tract and these do not bother her at all. In fact the reason she has always eaten the Star Brite or Starlight mints is that they help settle her stomach. She suffers from diverticulitis and is prone to attacks of diarrhea so she doesn't go anywhere without these mints. The sugar free version is very difficult to find locally so I'm thrilled to buy them buy the case on Amazon.

review/summary: Best sugar-free peppermint to be found
review/text: As a former sugar addict, I've spent a lot of time and money looking for sugar free substitutes for when I need a little something sweet.  There are several SF mints out there but the Brach's Star Brites are the best, in my opinion. Because they can be hard to find in stores, I order them in large quantities online so that I always have them on hand. I keep a bowl of them at work on my desk and my colleagues appreciate them.

review/summary: Who needs Ex-Lax?
review/text: I thought I was going to die. Cramping, bloating, severe diarrhea, rectal bleeding and total exhaustion. It took me a few days to realize I didn't have the plague but the new Brachs star brite candies I bought from Amazon were killing me. It says it is made with Splenda on the front of the package so I figured it would be a good sugar free candy. Guess again, the main ingredient on the label is Isomalt. Some kind of synthetic sugar substitute. It even says on the rear cover that excessive consumption can cause a laxative effect. A serving size is 3 candies. I should have just ate poison. This is not food.

These treats have all organic chicken, no meat bi-products, pro-biotics, and lots of other great ingredients.<br /><br />I purchased our first bag of Plato Farmers Market Chicken & Vegetables Treats for Dogs over a year ago, and she absolutely loved them. Many bags later, she still wags happily for them.<br /><br />I also give her the Plato Sweet Potato Treats. She loves to chew the sweet potatoes, and they are easier on her teeth than chewing bones. Plato, thank you for making such great products. You have two very grateful customers.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Chicken, carrot, celery, beet, parsley, lettuce, watercress, spinach, green pea, sweet potato, tomato, parsley, salt, zinc propionate, vitamin E supplement, coated ascorbic acid (source of vitamin C), bacillus subtilis.<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS:<br />- Grain-free -no corn, wheat, soy, grain fractions or fillers<br />- Natural ingredients, fortified with antioxidant vitamins, zinc propionate<br />- Contains a source of live (viable) naturally occurring microorganisms<br />- No artificial colors, flavors, synthetic preservatives, GMO's (genetically modified organisms), meat by-products or meals.<br />- Naturally preserved.

Both of our dogs love the treat and we feel that this is the healthiest product for our dogs.  You can see some of the vegetables and blueberries that are in this treat.  When I reach for the bag of treats both dogs go crazy.

This is even though the expiration date hasn't been reached yet. Also, the sweet potatoes are soft, as if they are not fully dehydrated. I've bought this product at local stores and haven't had a problem. This must be part of a bad batch. I won't be buying this product or other dog treats from Amazon again, as now I am out of the money I paid.

review/summary: Healthy and delicious!
review/text: My dogs love these sweet potato treats.  I feed my dogs grain-free diets and other high-end supplements, so of course I wanted a treat that followed our feeding ethic. This is low in protein and fat, so it is gentle on the stomach of puppies and sick dogs alike. My dogs go crazy over these. They love the taste and since these are a little tough, it takes them a bit longer to finish them, which is great because dogs usually swallow treats whole. They are not extremely tough though. Puppies can eat them. Even though the bag does not have an indication to refrigerate after opening, please do so. They will last longer and remain fresher. Plus, you could prevent mold growth. Amazon sells these by far at the most affordable price. Specialty stores sell these treats up to twice as much as Amazon does, so I suggest you buy them from Amazon. If you want a healthy treat, this is the way to go. :)

review/text: My dog refuses all vegetables, but he likes these treats.  Because the vegetables have been cooked and are dehydrated he should be able to get some nutrients out of them.  Dogs lack the enzymes to break down plants cell walls normally.  At first he hesitated to eat one, but I broke off a bit,and he decided they were good.  I also crumble two into his food each meal.  His fussy, meat-loving poodle pal also enjoys them--and no stomach upset.  Nice product.

review/text: My dog is allergic to almost every edible food, including treats. I was looking for something that could be a treat that wasn't manufactured and it wouldn't affect him, so I bought them. These sweet potatoes treats are all natural, he loves them and the best thing is that he is not allergic to them.  This is a perfect solution for those owners who want a different kind of treat for their dogs or for those dogs that are allergic to manufactured treats. I will be buying more.

review/summary: Sweet Potato Treats had mold on them
review/text: I have stocked our dogs' treat pantry with Plato's Farmers Market products for about a year. My dogs love their Salmon and Salmon with Vegetable treats. I recently purchased their Sweet Potato treats, which have a "Best by" date of 9-22-10. Shortly after opening the bag we saw that treats were covered in white & blue mold. Unacceptable & disgusting. The bag's sticker has "X00133D6P" on it. I have bought Plato products many times previously and have been pleased, however, these are supposed to be safe and quality treats. I absolve the seller, The Whole Healthy Pet, of responsibility of this issue as they have taken swift steps to rectify the issue. However, I do firmly assert that Plato should have done a much better job of notifying customers of a bad batches of Sweet Potato treats.

review/summary: Good product but a tad crumbly
review/text: My two dogs love these.  I bought them along with the regular Plato chicken treats when I saw they were USA made.  The only reason I gave these four stars instead of five is that they are somewhat crumbly when you get them out of the bag. I assume it's due to the vegetable content so I'm not really complaining. It's great to find products that are not only good tasting, but good for them as well.

He was thrown off by the texture I think and was having trouble chewing it. After he finally ate the first one he was sniffing around the garbage where we had put one he had left on the floor. He was trying to get the treat that was in there. Now everytime we break them out that's all he wants. Along with the Organic Chicken treats. He's hooked.

review/text: I have a dog with all kinds of allergies. She loves sweet potato treats and I love giving them to her because they're so healthy (the more I read about all the dangers of processed treats found in pet stores, the more resolute I am in my decision to never, ever feed her that garbage).<br /><br />The only problem I have with these treats is that they contain eggs and salt in addition to the natural sweet potato and probiotics. Eggs are a big no-no for any dog with food allergies, and salt is just something you shouldn't really be feeding your dog anyway. At least not in excessive quantities. These treats are a thousand times better than regular dog treats, but they didn't work for my dog.<br /><br />I've decided to stick to Snook's sweet potato treats. They're 100% dried sweet potato and nothing else - also made in the USA and my dog absolutely loves them.

review/text: I keep these in my desk at work. They are great when I don't really need much to eat, but want a snack.  Because this isn't an item that disappears in three bites, it helps satisfy cravings.

review/summary: Truly Awesome Fruit Snacks!
review/text: I tell every Mom I know about Florida's Natural Sour String, Fruit Stiks (yes that is how they are spelled) and Fruit Nuggets. These are indeed an awesome alternative to the junk out there for kids to snack on and they taste yummy too! No, they aren't actually fruit but they are definitely a healthier choice than other on-the-go snack choices.  Our favorite is Strawberry. Unfortunately these are really hard to find locally so when I do find them, I stock up!  If you aren't sure that you want to buy a 12 pack to start, check out their website for local retailers and buy a pack to try.  You'll be back here to place your order for all the varieties!

review/summary: my kids loved these
review/text: My kids and even my Mom loved these snakcs.  They are not "fruit snacks".  They are small and look like chiclets, but the taste is good.  The texture is closer to dried fruit than traditional fruit snacks.  I also like the small serving size.

review/summary: Made in CHINA...Deceptive Packaging! Do Not Buy.
review/text: We were looking for a healthy snack for our three children and purchased a case of these. On the front of the package in large letters is ..."Made from American Grown Fruits" but on the back in small letters is..."Made in China". I feel this is very deceptive on the part of this company. I wish we could return these, but they are not returnable to Amazon. Our children will not be eating these.

review/summary: Great Corn-Syrup & Dye Free Alternative
review/text: My kids and I love these. They are sweetened mostly with fruit puree and don't contain high fructose corn syrup or chemical dyes unlike most "fruit snacks."  These are very small pieces, about the size of a square pea and texture is like a firm gum drop, not chewy like gummy candy like a lot of fruit snacks.  Kids tend to choke on fruit snacks, and I find that this has not happened with these probably due to the smaller size and less slippery texture.  The little half once bags are a perfect little treat size that won't spoil their appetite.

review/summary: Family favorite
review/text: These are not like the standard cartoon-character-shaped fruit snacks.  They are small and pebble-like, as another reviewer said, and the texture is not gelatin-based like "regular" fruit snacks.  Every kid is different, but my daughter doesn't choke on these like she did with the regular fruit snacks.  She prefers the taste of these, and we've found that these don't upset her stomach like the "regular" fruit snacks do.<br /><br />While not as good as say, a banana, these seem better than a candy bar or cookie for a treat.  Each pouch is pretty small, but is more than enough for a toddler.

review/summary: Real fruit, yes  -  but real sweet, too.  No, I mean REAL sweet
review/text: The biggest selling point for Florida's Natural Fruit Nuggets is that they actually contain fruit.  Faint praise?  Not for me; that "66% fruit" blurb looks mighty inviting after I bought a competing product and then discovered it consisted almost solely of corn syrup and sugar.<br /><br />Fruit content isn't the only point where Fruit Nuggets differ from their competition, though.  They're not the big soft shapes one usually associates with fruit snacks; instead, they're like a little packet of pills or pellets.  (A full pack measures surfacewise about half the size of a cell phone.)  The nuggets don't have the gummy texture associated with fruit snacks; as others have noted, they're a grainy half-gel.  It's a change for the less-fun, but I could adjust.<br /><br />The problem: they're VERY sweet.  Not tart, just super-sweet  -  this is one big dose of fructose.  (Odd, isn't it; usually, the natural products err in being too staid and not sweet enough.)  The other problem is that pear puree is used as a base for all four flavors, and so the pear taste does somewhat overpower the strawberry, orange, etc.  I applaud the effort to use, you know, *actual fruit* in these snacks, but I hope that Florida's Natural tweaks the recipe so that the taste is as good as the quality of the ingredients.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I was looking for a healthy option to fruit chews. This is just candy. I bought a whole case of this on here, waste of my money. My son who loves candy won't even eat these. My girls and I don't like them either, they are just WAY TO SWEET! Disappointed.

review/summary: ***MADE IN CHINA***
review/text: The disturbing thing is that they are made in China.  Nowhere on the product description does it state that fact.  Florida's Natural - you would just assume they were made in Florida or someplace close.  I tossed the whole box out because I will not let my family ingest anything made in China.  I do not trust their production values.

review/summary: Not Absolutely Terrible, Not Great
review/text: Small, firm and pebble like, these are not the soft gummy type snacks that some may be more familiar with.  They are chewy with a slight grainy texture.  Although the ingredient list isn't great, it is nice that it doesn't have the artificial colors and high fructose corn syrup as others have mentioned.<br /><br />However, the taste leaves much to be desired.  The initial taste reminded me of Flintstones chewable vitamins and the aftertaste certainly reinforced the chewable vitamin resemblance.  The box I bought had three flavors - orange, blueberry, and strawberry.  While all three flavors initially taste different from one another, they all fade into the same "vitaminy" realm of flavor.<br /><br />I love natural snacks such as dried fruit (contrary to another reviewer, these don't remind me at all of dried fruit) and the more 'natural' brands of goodies.  I also indulge in mainstream candy junk food occasionally.  These are fairly gross, though, and I won't purchase them again.
