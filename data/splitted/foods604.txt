review/summary: If you like cherry cordials, give these a try
review/text: I like figs, but I don't love them.  However, these chocolate covered, chocolate filled, brandy infused figs are fantastic.  The brandy is a little strong, which I prefer, so if you like your alcoholic-based treats to be really tame, then this might be too much.  The chocolate is quite nice, particularly the creamy filling.  These treats are worth the price; I would buy them again.  Even if you're not too sure, I'd recommend trying them out.

review/text: If you're a serious chocolate lover, these are for you.  These figs are filled with a thick, gooey, very dark, very rich chocolate.  They are coated on the outside with a soft chocolate shell.  The taste of the fig is still apparent.  Very good.  Although there are only a few candies, they are each a large size, and they are so rich you couldn't eat more than one at once, anyways.

It was an impulse buy, meant to be gifted. I tried one package and loved them; ate the other package, too -- please don't tell my relatives.  By the time I decided I had to have more the items were out of stock at both places.  Oh well, I placed it on my Wish List and will wait 'til next year or, maybe better, take a trip to Spain and get some there.

review/text: These taste really good. If you're a fan of chocolate and raspberry, then you should try them. the raspberry is not too sweet and glossy, but not goopy. You can even taste a seed here and there, which I think adds to the authenticity. The chocolate is good, and the cookie is very cake-like. Plus, they are lower in fat than you would think two little chocolate raspberry cookies would be. I wish these cookies were as pretty as the one on the box, though!

review/text: We had a problem with a lot of fruit flies in our kitchen.  I picked up one of these to take care of business despite spotty reviews.  Oops.<br /><br />We had it up for several days and I saw one fly land on it the entire time.  The best part of this tragic story is that when I picked up the trap to investigate the one trapped fly...I'l be darned if that fly didn't pick up his feet and take off. That's right, the fly flew away after landing on this.  None of the other flies in the area even bothered.<br /><br />They should call this the "sucker" trap.  The sucker in this case would be me.

review/summary: It's OK. A fancy flypaper
review/text: The picture was a bit misleading. I thought it was a trap where flies entered inside and were trapped, like a roach motel. When I received it, the design looked different, and it was obvious that it was a a square "tube" coated with very sticky adhesive, where the flies land and stick. As such, it works but not exactly what I expected. I would have designed it differently, though and put the adhesive on the inside and entrance holes on the outside so it doesn't look so ugly when the flies are caught.

The flies were especially bad this year, so I tried the Victor fly trap because I like their rat and mouse traps and didn't want to spray in the kitchen.<br />Save your money and DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I caught many flies with a little milk in the bottom of a small water bottle.  They flew in and drowned themselves. I don't think California flies are smarter than any others so the trap just doesn't work.

review/text: I've been nurturing a plant at work and it was doing so well I decided to repot to a larger pot. I must have gotten some funky soil because as soon as I repotted, we were being overrun by a large colony of small flies. I was swatting them and getting bug guts on my hand so frequently I stopped bothering with the "gross!" exclamations. The fact that in the city of San Francisco, you have to compost just aggravated the situation.<br /><br />I bought one of these nitfy traps and set it by my plant and voila! Instead of my hands getting the daily dose of bug guts, the trap is now lined with the tiny suckers! It's been a few months and the trap is pretty much covered (the gross part) and I need to order another one. Not sure how well this will work on larger inserts but it works really well on these tiny, annoying flies.

review/text: Used this fly sticky tape trap in the garage where we had a knat fly problem. We also had some fruit fly type  bugs flying around also. Our neghbor has a big fig tree that isn't pruned of taken care of and all the figs stay on the tree and rot till they dry. Smells really bad and attracts the flys that go into our garage because of its proximity to our garage. We put these up and only caught about 3 to four on each one. We had better results with the sticky traps that unravel. These caught much more knats.

review/text: Like others have said, hanging this up is useless. You have to lie it down in an area where the flies like to land. I have caught dozens and dozens of flies with this, however I have noticed that some of these traps are stickier than others. The flies in my house also seem to have figured out how to basically "walk" down the trap until they get to the end, where they can get unstuck and fly off. Maybe 25% of the flies escape, and the others are trapped. I actually have taken to pressing the flies into the trap once they land, to try to keep them from escaping, but this is disturbing and I'd rather not have to do that. The Catchmaster Window glue trap is really superior to this product by comparison (but is currently unavailable...).

review/summary: Works Great!
review/text: Having used traditional fly rolls in the past, I was dubious when my hubby opened up the box and showed me this little stand-alone cardboard fly trap. We were desperate, though, as we had a full-on gnat invasion in our kitchen. We put it in a few places on the counter before settling on one near the coffee pot where the gnats seemed to love to gather. At first they seemed to ignore it, but over the next few days, more and more were finding their way onto the trap. At one point we gave up counting--there were dozens. This product is great for ridding yourself of those pesky gnats. I love that it is poison-free and that it can stand on the countertop if you want it to, as our very tall ceilings would make a hanging strip less than useful. But for those wishing to hang it, there's a little hanger included as well. I can't make a claim about larger flies, we didn't catch any of those--there were none around. And I think there would be better choices for outdoors than this product. But for the $$ this little fly trap did the job we asked it to do, and you can't beat that!

review/summary: Prettier than fly paper
review/text: Well I received the item and placed it in the same area where we had put fly paper before-we had far fewer victims than with the regular fly paper and it looks like it doesn't really catch "the big ones" like the fly paper did. However, for the price it is decent and looks more attractive than the regular strip of fly paper.

review/summary: A sure death for flies
review/text: I bought a few of these after my apartment was infested with fruit flies. After only a few hours, the trap had &quot;attracted&quot; many flies and within a few days they were practically gone. This may not be a long term  solution, but if flies are driving you crazy, consider buying this. One  caution- the surface is very sticky, so try to avoid touching it.

review/summary: Random luck fly trap
review/text: I don't really think that the design of the cardboard box makes one bit of difference to the flies. House or fruit flies. Flies land on pretty much anything. With sufficient time flies flying around randomly and landing randomly around the house. Eventually they'll land on the fly trap.<br /><br />Perhaps after the first few have landed and died on the trap the rest will be attracted to the scent of the dead flies? Directly out of the box, I don't think there is anything on it that is an attractant.

review/text: Even the cheap 'ribbon' traps have caught many dozens of flies in the few days I've had them, and the liquid bait traps (Rescue, and Victor's Fly Magnet) have caught hundreds in a few days, but this thing remains empty (the best seems to be the Rescue trap, I call "the stinker", because it reeks, but it works). This trap is in the same space as the other traps, and there are hundreds of flies out there. Just does not work. While it is an "indoor" trap, the directions say that it can be used outdoors if protected by weather, which it is.

review/text: In the time I spent waiting for my order of these fly traps to arrive, I went out and bought regular fly ribbon for the bad fly problem (not sure what kind of flies - slightly bigger than fruit flies) I was having. In the at least week that I've had one of these fly traps up, I've caught zero flies with this fly trap and have caught probably over 100 flies with the regular fly ribbon. At one point, I even saw a fly on this fly trap and thought it was caught, but now it's gone. I even have pictures to prove it.

My husband bought this trap and it did not work, not one fly was caught.  I ended up putting a tiny smear of honey on one side and that actually worked, the next day I counted over 30 flies on the thing.  But by itself, it does nothing to 'attract' flies.

review/text: I'm always on the lookout for good jerky in my area, so I was excited to try these Tanka Bites. The ingredients look like pemmican (except, sadly, minus the fat), which I've wanted to try but can't find locally. These flavor is pretty good -- savory and a little sweet -- and they're not super tough or overly chewy. The texture is a little bit plasticy, though. The dried, sweetened cranberries might not make it Whole 30 approved, but it's definitely a convenient primal snack.

If price isn't a concern, then there's no real negative for this product.<br /><br />This jerky is also a great option for those who on a gluten free diet. It's difficult to find gluten free jerky because many products include soy sauce and other unfriendly flavorings. This product doesn't contain any wheat or ingredients that contain wheat.

review/text: My daughter is studying Native Americans at school.  I ordered Tanka Bites to share with her grade level.  They were a huge hit and 2nd graders are tough critics.  The children also enjoyed the product information on the packaging.  I chose this product because it was a Native American company. However, I will buy more (& have already ordered) because it is really good.  The Tanka Bites are a nice texture, easy to chew.  The cranberry adds a nice burst of flavor.  I am looking forward to trying the spicy pepper blend.  I do NOT like jerky products and seldom eat meat.  Interestingly enough, I have found myself wishing, on more than one occasion, that I had another bag of Tanka Bites on hand for a quick snack.  You know it is a good product when you can't wait to re-order!

I have used "bags" to put loose tea in and balls to hold loose tea or a pot with a filter in the middle, I've used a small filter that sits on top of my cup but nothing works near as well, and is as convenient as this pot. You put the loose tea and boiling water in the pot and after it has steeped you place the pot on top of your cup, the tea drips into the cup because the rim of the cup presses it's valve.It is the simplest way to make loose tea that I know of. A uniquie gift idea. I plan on getting one for all my tea drinking friends. Christmas shopping is going to be easy this year.

Cleaning the tea leaves out required filling the pot with water and swishing it around instead of having a tea filter to dump the leaves in one swoop. That is the only set back to this great product.

review/text: I feed my cats a raw-food diet. I feed this to them like treats. I sprinkle it on their regular food and they love it. You can safely feed this to your cats as their regular food (as long as you add water), but it's too pricey for me to feed it 100%. Apart from the price, I highly recommend this product.

review/text: My kids and I enjoyed this granola. It had a nice fresh taste (unless some of the stale tasting ones we have had). The chocolate chucks were a bonus for my daughter who normally doesn't eat granola. I put it over homemade ice cream and they gobbled it up. I ate it as cereal with milk and enjoyed it. I have been happy with every Back to Nature product I have purchased and this is no exception. I would buy it again.

review/summary: The absolute best granola!!
review/text: I'm kind of so-so when it comes to granola. Don't really care for it as a cereal or snack, but do enjoy it mixed into ice cream. My favorite has been a brand I get at Trader Joe's - not too sweet, and not  gritty or "flat" tasting like some of the lower-end brands.<br /><br />Well, there's a new winner when it comes to granola. This is fantastic - loads of really good chocolate plus excellent granola taste. Crunchy, but not so hard that it feels like it's going to break a tooth. The first granola that I enjoyed right out of the bag as-is -- no need to mix it in with ice cream or yogurt. This stuff is great!!

review/summary: It's Granola with Chocolate... Who Doesn't Love Chocolate!
review/text: Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is a tasty and fairly healthy snack.  It comes in a sturdy 12-ounce pouch, with a strong Ziploc-like seal you can use to keep it fresh.  The Granola pieces are nice and crunchy and taste very fresh.  The chocolate pieces are not so much mixed into the granola chucks as they are just separate Chicklet-like chocolate pieces (there appears to be little bits of chocolate in some of the granola chunks, though).  The mix of granola and chocolate is quite addictive.  The crunchy texture and nutty taste of the granola goes well with the smooth texture and sweet taste of the chocolate.<br /><br />The all natural ingredients are things you'll be able to understand, there's nothing foreign here.  As far as nutritional value it concerned, a serving is half a cup and has lots of fiber, 220 calories and a decent amount of fat.  It's no rice cake, but it tastes a lot better, and there are far worse choices out there.<br /><br />All in all... Perfect for the office, in the car, or while watching TV - it's a tasty snack.

review/summary: Good snack, or yogurt topping, or...whatever you want it to be
review/text: I really wasn't sure how I was supposed to eat the granola chunks when I first received the package, because they were more like the granola that you add to yogurt - in small pieces.  But there were also pieces that were too big to be topping.  So I used them both as finger food and a yogurt topping.  I find that alone, it's a little too sweet, and as a yogurt topping, it's nothing special.  However, it's not a bad snack, because it uses some good ingredients and the dark chocolate helps add extra taste.  In other words, this is a light, fun, and tasty snack that won't put you back too  many fat calories, and provides some nutritious benefits as well.  Just don't expect something that redefines granola as a snack.

review/summary: What are you looking for?
review/text: On first bite, I found this granola to lack much sweetness.  Then again, I am comparing it to those sugary cereals that people who are looking into this product are probably trying to avoid.  Adding some milk, I found that the cereal was very nicely balanced and has a very healthy taste.  That means that I felt good after eating it and not weighed down.  As for the technical nutritional facts, the ingredients and stats are listed here (a nice thing about Amazon).  The absence of high fructose corn syrup and the basic natural ingredients are quite reassuring, but, as with all granolas I've seen, portion control will be needed to keep the calorie count down (220 per half cup).  I found the texture quite good for cereal, crumbly bits and all, which is how I eat it.  It may be a bit messy for casual consumption by hand.<br /><br />Overall, this is really basic.  It would be quite inexpensive and easy to make this yourself.  That is not a bad thing, though.  It means that when convenience is at a premium, this product carries the benefits and comforts of something homemade.  If the price doesn't scare you, I would heartily recommend it.

review/summary: Tastes great, missing the clusters
review/text: First things first, this granola is TASTY. Straight out of the pouch. And for me, that's a BIG bonus since that's how I eat my granola probably 97% of the time. And honestly, I don't really eat granola because it's good for you---I eat it because it tastes good and is *somewhat* healthy (i.e. it's better to snack on this than chocolate cake, LOL).<br /><br />I was also looking forward to more clusters, since the description says "Crunchy Clusters"--but it was mostly oat pieces and chocolate chunks, which makes it quite hard to eat straight from the bag without a spoon or making a complete mess (I actually took to just dumping it straight into my mouth).<br /><br />All that said, I would buy this again. I received this item as part of the Vine program, so I had no idea how much it cost. One true test of an item is to think how much you would pay for it, and THEN check to see what it sells for. After I tasted it, I thought I'd probably pay $3 to $4 a bag--well, at Amazon's current price, it works out to $3.60/pouch so it was dead on.

review/summary: Tasty and Delicious Just Wished Did Not Have Extra "Sugar" Hidden As Carbs
review/text: I am a big fan of granola, but unfortunately not a big fan of fat, which is traditionally what one gets with granola.  For those concerned about taste, I would say this is a great product and if rating on taste alone I would give this "Back to Nature" product 5 Stars.  However, once again we have a product that "looks" seemingly healthy and fun, but is loaded with added carbohydrates, aka "sugar" and that is what brings the score on this product down.  You think companies would work with today;s busy professionals and re-establish trust, by offering products that are truly truly healthy and not just slipping them in under the FDA or surgeon general guide lines of what is deemed good health or nutrition.  I am  very health conscious so always reading labels for ingredients.  Furthermore I have to keep my sugar intake in check during this "look better naked" summer months.  Great treat, but for those looking to shed the extra pounds of fat or get leaner during the summer save this for the winter months or during your bulking phase.

This new Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is delightful, tastes great, has real chunks of chocolate and is loaded with 28 grams of whole grains. If you love granola you have got to try this product - although I do have to wonder about the copy on the back which talks about feeling warm sand beneath my feet, but the re-closable Ziplock bag more than makes up for it.

'Nough said.<br /><br />If you like dark chocolate and granola, this one's for you.  I guess the only "gripes" I have is that I didn't initially know it was dark chocolate because the title and the big letters on the bag only say chocolate.  But, c'est la vie.  I prefer dark chocolate anyway.<br />And, I guess from years of being subjected to sugary granola often found in McDonald's yogurts and grocery cereals, I wasn't expecting the oaty taste I found in here, which is, I presume, what granola is supposed to taste like!<br /><br />Good stuff.  I'm eating it as I compose this review!

review/text: I happen to like granola and I LOVE dark chocolate, so this snack hits the spot. If you are concerned about your health, the granola has a high fiber content (4 G per half cup serving) and the dark chocolate is high in anti-oxidants. The sugar content (13G) is higher that I'd like, but, after all, this IS a snack.

review/summary: Too sweet, even for a treat!
review/text: This granola was WAY to sweet, WAY WAY WAY too sweet, and it was lacking nutty goodness I expect in a granola.<br />The dark chocolate used in the granola was very good, I found myself picking out the bits, as the sugary coated oats was just too much for me.<br />Well, not JUST sugar, it really was evaporated cane juice (AKA a sugar), Brown rice syrup (AKA another sugar) and molasses (AKA another sugar) on top of the SUGAR and DEXTROSE already in the chocolate pieces.<br />I think my pancreas is in shock. Why so much sugar?<br />And why are the only ingredients (other than the sugars) basically oats and chocolate? How about some nuts?<br />This is basically dried oatmeal and chocolate bits held together with SUGAR.<br />I like a sweet treat, but this is overboard. I would think using 1/2 or less of the sugar in this would have left it tasting naturally sweet. And the addition of SOMETHING, anything other than plain oats would have been a welcome addition for the tastebuds.<br />Nope, for a wholesome snack this didn't do it for me. If I could describe it in two words it would be : SUGARY BLANDNESS.

review/summary: Little dark chocolate bits melt on your tongue. Yum!
review/text: There are 3 main styles of granola:<br />1) Hard and crunchy (aka the broken-up granola bar), good for single-hand snacking and on-the-go snacking.  Firm and won't fall apart in your hands.<br /><br />2) Chewy (broken up cookie/dense cake type), good for snacking but can be sticky and messy. Usually need more than one hand to eat this.<br /><br />3) Crumbly, mainly good for cereal, shot-glass style snacking or sprinkling over yogurt and ice cream.<br /><br />This product is the 3rd type: small crisp crumbly clusters the size of large popcorn, but also a lot of little bits in the bag.  The little bits account for a little over 1/3 of the product in the bag. (See uploaded photo)<br /><br />Taste:<br />The product is a not too sweet granola with small thin chocolate bits evenly distributed in it.  The small chocolate bits melt nicely on your tongue and there is no excessive chewing of large hard chocolate chunks or worse, chocolate sprinkles, powders or coating on the granola. Simple granola + chocolate bits in the right size. The chocolate is a decent but not spectacular dark semi-sweet chocolate that isn't crunchy but melts on contact with your tongue.<br /><br />Packaging:<br />The bag is resealable, but the tear-off strip was messy and ineffective. I had to use scissors.<br /><br />You could easily make something just like this at home, but this product's main selling point is the size and consistency of the chocolate bits.  Also, packaged granola is convenient.<br /><br />Good for those who like sweet breakfasts and snacks and for those who like chocolate with their granola but don't like the hard chunks of chocolate they usually have.  It would also make a semi-healthy snack for kids (who don't mind dark chocolate) using the jello-cup method. I would not recommend this for on-the-go snacking because it is rather crumbly and the chocolate melts easily. I would also not recommend this for milk chocolate lovers. For those who live in the warmer parts of the country and for the upcoming summer months, the chocolate might melt during transport.<br /><br />Granola is to oats what a Caramel Latte is to milk: a very tasty spin on something healthy by making it less so, but in the end it is still made from something healthy and better than candy or cola.

review/summary: Tasty product with a great ingredient list
review/text: First, a disclaimer.  I am strange in the fact that I like cereal as a bedtime snack.  That way, in my diet riddled mind, I am getting some quality nutrition for the calories I am eating (as opposed to , say, ice cream).  With that off of my chest, this is a great cereal.<br /><br />One quarter to one half of a cup of this granola with some milk and I am totally satisfied.  The chocolate taste proved totally enjoyable - even though I had my doubts about how chocolate and cold milk would get that whole "melt in your mouth" thing going.  Somehow, Back to Nature pulls it off.<br /><br />The ingredient list is also very good.  No preservatives, colors or flavors.  The first ingredient is rolled oats and the second is semi-sweet chocolate.  That information alone will give you a sense of the predominant flavors.

review/summary: Great taste, but mislabeled
review/text: I ordered this granola last week and was really looking forward to trying it.  I can't have dairy, so before I placed my order, I checked its product page both on Amazon and on Back to Nature's own website for any milk, butter, etc. listed in the ingredients.  Everything cleared (yay!), so I went ahead and ordered it.<br /><br />While waiting for the granola to arrive, I perused the reviews on this page just to see what others thought about it.  For the most part, it sounded delicious and that everyone had enjoyed it.  But at least one person had listed "skim milk" among the ingredients, and upon reading this, my alarm bells went off.  Surely Back to Nature's own website would list the correct ingredients of their product, right?  Upon receiving my granola yesterday, I immediately flipped to the back of the package -- and wouldn't you know it, clearly listed (as part of the chocolate chunks) is nonfat milk.<br /><br />I don't know if Vine Voices were given a beta product, or perhaps Back to Nature changed their recipe and wanted to get rid of their backstock.  Which information source are we supposed to believe, the product packaging or the company website?  This mislabeling won't be an issue for most people, but it is a risk for those who are lactose intolerant or who otherwise don't consume dairy.<br /><br />Mislabeled or not, I wasn't willing to chance it, so I skipped eating the chocolate pieces but still ate the plain oat clusters.  It was very sweet and oaty, like a decadent "dessert-type" granola -- similar to Quaker Chewy bars, except not as moist.  I ate a few handfuls out of the bag but found it too dry; it was much more palatable eaten in a bowl with soymilk over it.  I do think it would be nice in an oatmeal cookie mix or over yogurt.  Although this granola has a pleasant flavor, mouthfeel, and crunch, I have tasted better and would rate this fairly average.<br /><br />Looking down into my bag when I was done with the oat clusters, I noticed that the chocolate pieces are all very tiny, flat, brick-shaped flakes -- instead of asymmetrical, craggly, varyingly-sized chunks.  I don't know why I was expecting the latter, but obviously it wasn't a big deal since I didn't eat them. :)<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice-tasting average granola.  You wouldn't be doing yourself a disservice by purchasing this -- it's tasty -- but there is better granola out there.  If you can't have dairy, you may want to opt for another variety/flavor just to be safe.

However, in warm weather, which we are having now, the chocolate melted in the bag. So, into the refrigerator to chill out.<br /><br />The clusters of oats are small and held together by the sweeteners. It is sweet but not overly sweet, the bitter chocolate blends it out.<br />It's great as a ice cream topping or a yogurt mix in.<br /><br />If you eat it straight out of the bag, your hands will be a chocolate mess.<br />Enjoy it, but keep a paper towel nearby.

review/text: Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is a combination of very dark chocolate and crunchy granola.  At 220 calories per one-half cup, it cannot be considered low-calorie.  It has a saturated fat content of 2g, 5mg sodium,13g sugar, and dietary fiber of 4g. I find that storing this product in the refrigerator keeps the chocolate at just the right consistency.  This is an extremely good-tasting combination and makes for a great snack.  The dark chocolate has just the right sweetness.  Others have remarked about the granola being crumbly and not very many clusters.  However, it is granola, and granola is quite crumbly.  Immediately upon opening and tasting Chocolate Delight Granola, I instantly fell in love with the crunch and flavor mix.  If you love dark chocolate, this item is for you.  The granola mixed in gives it a wonderful touch. Highly recommend it as a snack.  Very good!

review/text: Granola has a healthy reputation but the truth is that it is usually chock full of calories, fat, sodium, and sugar.<br /><br />This granola is not as sweet as many (Our favorite is Whole Foods Almond Crunch, which is as addictive as crack, but has tons of sugar and fat)  Although it doesn't look like that much chocolate, you can taste it in every bite.<br /><br />This granola is surprisingly healthy - no palm oil, hydrogenated fats, etc.  Some saturated fat, I presume from the chocolate.  All the ingredients are identifiable<br /><br />Here are the numbers compared to Cheerios (Which I consider the healthiest cereal this side of organic free range sawdust)<br /><br />First I have to adjust the serving size to get a fair comparison.  Cheerios uses a 28g serving size with 100 calories while BTN Granola<br /><br />Going with 50 gm servings for both,<br /><br />BTN = 220 calories, Cheerios = 179<br />Calories from fat: BTN = 23%, Cheerios = 15%<br />Carb calories from sugar: BTN = 35%, Cheerios = 5%<br />Protein: BTN = 5g, Cheerios = 5g<br />Sodium: BTN=5 mg, Cheerios = 339mg!<br />Dietary fiber: BTN = 4 g, Cheerios = 7g<br /><br />Overall, it's quite healthy and tasty.  I recommend it.  Four stars though as I would have preferred a bit stronger flavor (more vanilla perhaps?)<br /><br />My ratings: 1star: Avoid! / 2star: Some merit but I can't recommend  / 3star: Decent, recommended / 4star: Highly recommended  / 5 star: Nearly perfect!<br /><br />If you have found this review to be helpful, please let me know!

First, some of the chocolate chunks had melted, maybe a packaging issue, maybe a chocolate selection issue, but still.  Second, it's extremely dry and granular.  Not a big granola eater, all I saw I could do with it would be mix it with oatmeal or ice cream.  It's ok, I believe I prefer granola to be in slightly larger chunks.

The chocolate is a semi-sweet and the granola is lightly sweetened.  It is somewhat hard to eat because the pieces don't clump together (probably because there isn't a lot of added sugar).  I tried eating it while walking on a golf course and it was tough.  The granola is almost airy when chewing.  I would probably be good eating like cereal.  I usually put granola in my yogurt but, wouldn't do that with this chocolate chip one.  Overall, pretty good stuff but, hard to eat on the go.

review/summary: Yummy Yummy in my Tummy!
review/text: This granola is fantastic.  It's crunchy, there's a lot of chocolate chunks in it, and it's healthy - what more can I ask for?  I eat this granola with yogurt for breakfast or afternoon snack. If I'm looking for a little chocolate fix at night, I don't feel bad about snacking on something this good for me!

review/summary: Very good tasting, healthy granola snack
review/text: This granola is surprisingly good, and healthy too.  It comes in a resealable zip-lock package, and it consists of chunks AND BITS of granola and dark chocolate.  It is crunchy and delicious.  Back to Nature makes this granola with no artificial preservatives, flavors or colors.  It is an excellent source of whole grain.  The packaging describes it as crunchy clusters of whole grain rolled oats and dark chocolate chunk, sweetened with natural ingredients, and this is a fairly accurate description.  They say "chunks", but it's more like chunks and some smaller bits.  It's something you would dump into a bowl and eat by hand out of a bowl.  I found it difficult to control just by pulling handfuls out of the bag and holding it in my hand.<br /><br />Serving size is one-half cup, and one serving contains 220 calories, 50 of those calories are from fat.  Here are some stats from the label's "% Daily Value": 9% total fat, 10% saturated fat, 5% potassium, 12% total carbs, 16% dietary fiber, sugars 13g, other carbs 20g, protein 5g.<br /><br />Calcium 2%, Iron 10%, Phosphorus 15%, Magnesium 15%, Zinc 10%, Copper 15%.<br /><br />Ingredients: whole grain rolled oats, semi-sweet chocolate chunks (chocolate, sugar, dextrose, cocoa butter, soy lecithin,, vanilla extract, nonfat milk), evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, brown rice flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, molassess, vitamin E (a natural vitamin to help preserve flavor), natural flavor.<br /><br />Contains soy, milk.<br /><br />Manufactured on equipment that processes wheat.<br /><br />I cannot guarantee you that they won't change the product or the product label at any point, but this is what's on the label of my sample package.<br /><br />Overall Rating:  Delicious, healthy snack food!

review/summary: Mmm, Dark Chocolate
review/text: Honestly, I expected the worst with this product. I thought that I wouldn't like it. And then the package arrived. There looked to be only a small portion of dark chocolate mixed into the granola.<br /><br />Then I took some in my mouth.<br /><br />And the taste was amazing. The dark chocolate taste explodes about halfway through chewing the granola. And it is very satisfy. If you are a fan on dark chocolate, and want a healthier snack then just a plain bar, try this product. you won't regret it.

review/summary: Loaded with chocolate - and calories
review/text: Dieters beware, this stuff contains more calories per gram than a Hershey's dark chocolate bar. But if that's not a concern, this granola is delicious, like eating a crumbled chocolate chip cookie.  My kids love it, and even argued over the last crumbs in the bag.  I like the crunchy texture and I didn't think it was too sweet.  It's very good mixed about 1:3 with Special K or other unsweetened cereal.  It would also be good as an ice cream topping or yogurt mix-in, but it's just too rich to eat by itself as cereal or snack.

review/summary: Is it a snack or a breakfast?
review/text: I thought this was okay - the chocolate was interesting and not overly sweet.  Granola can be pretty high in fat -- this was moderately so -- definitely not diet food. The idea of chocolate for breakfast doesn't really appeal to me so I would be more inclined to eat this as a snack but as a snack, I would expect it to be in bigger chunks -- this is just going to leave a bunch of small crumbles at the bottom of the bag or a bowl if you serve it as a snack.<br /><br />As for those in our house who do like chocolate for breakfast -- they're not granola eaters so it's hard to know just who the target market for this would be.  It doesn't look like it's anyone in our house.

review/summary: Chocolate Granola huh? An oxymoronic goodness ...
review/text: At first these two ingredients really do not go together. Granola is often thought of as a healthy food and chocolate - well, not so much.<br /><br />The taste is not really one or the other - but a good break if you feel like something mildly sweet and somewhat solid. A rare craving - but if you have it - then it is good stuff.<br /><br />The chocolate is tasty and seems to have just enough to make you want more. Not too much to drown out the granola ...
