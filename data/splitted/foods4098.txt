review/summary: Green Mountain kcup Black Magic, Black Diamond Extra Bold, Nantucket Blend
review/text: I have tried many of the available coffee's available but, I enjoy a robust coffee in the morning and both Black Magic and Black Diamond Extra Bold meet and exceed what I was expecting.  The Nantucket Blend is a great coffee for anytime of day or night.  I usually wait until Amazon has a sale on these to make my purchase...Make sure when you buy k cups that the Amazon Prime logo appears...Without the Amazon Prime Logo, I have found what I received in the past did not reflect what I had ordered.. Substitution get made without your knowledge and sometimes count is short, etc...

review/text: If you are a coffee purist, you must give this Double Black Diamond a try.  I like straight up, unadulterated black coffee in the morning - as another reviewer put it - a real "kick in the (@$!"  Well this coffee delivers. The aroma is enticing and from the first sip you will probably be hooked.  Give 'er a try if you're a bold coffee kind of person. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

review/text: My husband has done nothing but complain since I purchased our Kurig,he did not like any of the coffee until I purchased the Green Mountain Double Black Diamond. He really likes it as it has bold flavor and no watery taste. As for myself, I prefer milder coffee, I can even reuse the Double Black Diamond for myself. But my real favorite is the Lake and Lodge.

review/summary: Got my hubby's approval
review/text: Bought a Keurig for times when a single cup of coffee is all that is needed.  What I had not anticipated was that my husband was underwhelmed with the assortment of coffees that came with the brewer... until I found the Double Black Diamond Extra Bold. Now my Keurig is being used for afternoon coffee breaks and I don't feel like my "investment" is headed to a yard sale/thrift shop anytime soon.  If you are a lover of stronger, premium coffee, this may be exactly what you are looking for when a pot of coffee is simply too much for one.

review/summary: Very Dark and Bold
review/text: This is one of my favorite K-Cups, and over the last several months I've sampled pretty much all the "extra bold" ones I can find. This one is very dark and strong without being too bitter (although I don't mind a little bit of bitterness in mine). They are similar to the Green Mountain "Dark Magic" variety, but I find that they are stronger, and perhaps a little more bitter. For reference, my favorite K-Cup is the Starbucks French Roast variety, but I also really like this kind, Green Mountain Dark Magic, and Emeril's Big Easy Bold.

review/text: My husband hasn't been able to find a K-cup bold enough for his taste.  I bought the Double Black Diamond after comparing reviews for the various brands and blends.  We have not been disappointed.<br /><br />This has a french roast taste, which is a favorite of his but not usually a favorite of mine. The coffee is not bitter nor does the coffee taste burnt.  Pretty decent on days where I want something with more of a punch.<br /><br />I am glad this is the brand/blend that I chose.  I probably won't be experimenting with the K-cup bold blends. This one works for us.

review/text: I like coffee strong.  I want full flavor and I will live with a hint of bitterness to up the coffee strength.  Double Black Diamond is getting there, but it's still a touch weaker than I prefer.  Green Mountain's Dark Magic, or Sumatra Reserve, go a little darker and deeper and are, in my estimation, the five-star K-cups.  This one's close, but still not on the target.

review/text: I've tried lots of different coffees in my Kuerig brewer located in my office.  I like strong coffee, but it also has to be smooth.  Some of the stronger coffees tend to be bitter, but at least for me the double black diamond is smooth and tasteful.  While I drink some other flavors just for variety, this is by far my favorite for that first cup in the morning.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: My original review was 1 star because I believe that I got a bad batch. I kept trying it and finally it started tasting good. It is the strongest K Kup on the market. With every other bold-strong coffee that I used to buy, I needed to use the 4oz setting on my Keurig or else it would be too weak. With this brand I can use the middle setting  (8oz) and it is still strong enough for me. Actually this saves money. Be warned, if you do not like strong coffee you will need to use the highest level on your Keurig or you will think it is too strong. If you want the strongest, this is the one you need to get.

You will swear you eating your favorite "movie theatre" popcorn.<br /><br />If you are like me and you've always loved popcorn, but never really had a easy way to cook it and have it taste like real movie theatre popcorn, then this is for you.<br /><br /> As a kid we had all different type of poppers; an old aluminum pot that sat on a electric burner, one of Mom's older pots with a non-stick surface, the plastic cone looking things to use with a microwave.... still none of them gave us the taste and smell of movie theatre popcorn.<br /><br />I finally broke down and bought a kettle style popper. Most importantly I found the "Mega-Pop" popcorn packages. Each package container just the right amount of corn, cooking oil and popcorn salt to make the best tasting popcorn you've ever eaten !<br /><br />Now you say, "I can't afford a kettle style popper",  no problem. If it is just me here, I snip the top of each container and pour about half of each item into a pot with a non-stick surface, cover the pop and shake the pot 'til it is done popping. Put the corn in a bowl, bag or basket and sprinkle with popcorn salt.... goes great watching a movie, college football game - whatever.

review/text: I love this popcorn, I order it every time we are running low, it's the best for popcorn machines!!! Just like movie theater quality!!! BUT this seller is the WORST place to buy it, I ordered and paid for this popcorn on the 4th of February and the seller just now bothered to SHIP it!!!

We've been out of popcorn for a WEEK, here it is Valentines Day and we wanted to stay home tonight and watch some romantic movies and make some popcorn.... but thanks to this seller we have NO popcorn!!! There are so many places to buy this wonderful popcorn don't buy from Ron unless you don't mind waiting TWO WEEKS to get it!<br /><br />GGGRRRR Sorry but I'm really upset!

review/summary: melt-in-your-mouth chocolate bar
review/text: Twirl chocolate candy bar tastes and feels pretty much like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BR1A0C">Nestle Aero Milk Chocolate Bar, 1.6-Ounces (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JSLYSU">Cadbury Flake Chocolate Bars, 6-Count</a>.  `They're all made of cheap mainstream chocolate but they're designed to be thin and flaky or have airbubbles such that you're not eating a thick dense boulder of chunky chocolate that's hard to bite into and instead eating something that melts in your mouth.  I would rather buy these types of chocolates than the US mainstream cheap chocolates just because of how they're designed.  However, they're not as good as the premium chocolates that use more expensive chocolate ingredients.

review/summary: OPPS!!  Not the same as the True Lemon in envelopes
review/text: This True Lemon is not the same as the True Lemon that is sold in the single serving envelope.  It does not have the fresh Lemon flavor that the envelopes have.  The envelopes are labeled for use in water, teas & recipes.  The large jar is labeled for cooking, baking, & seasoning.  I called the manufacturer and they said the true lemon is different in the jar because it is designed to survive the heat of cooking and baking.  If you want the taste of fresh Lemon for beverages, you have to use the True Lemon in envelopes.

review/text: True Lemon almost makes the lemon obsolete.  The taste is exactly right, every time- from lemonade to fish to green beans.  The only thing missing is the pulp. The product comes in a little sugar-like bag for individual servings, but the shaker is the way to go when you are standing in front of the stove.  This is crystal stuff doesn't spoil or "go bad" like liquid lemon substitutes. The package says Cold Pressed and Crystallized Lemon.  Ingredients: Citric acid, evaporated cane juice (a bulking agent), lemon juice, lemon oil and ascorbic acid (vitamin C).  It is the real thing, always at hand. Great stuff, wonderful stuff. Life just got a little better.

review/summary: This will last me forever...
review/text: This product is simple - if you like True Lemon, you will like this shaker. For those of you who do not know what True Lemon is picture this: if you always order a lemon with your water at the restaurant, you will probably love this too. True Lemon is crystallized lemon so it has a sugar type consistency. Just a few shakes into your water, stir, and it tastes just like you squeezed a fresh lemon in your water. I used to get the individual packets for water bottles, but they are not ideal for just a glass of water. My friend had the shaker at her house and I loved it, so I decided to look into it. Couldn't find it in stores so to Amazon I went. It says its for cooking but no worries, works for water just fine. The size of the bottle was bigger than I expected as well. If you got the individual packets and found that they got clumpy after some time, don't be weary because so far this product has not done that.<br /><br />Overall - great product. No complaints what-so-ever :)

review/text: I love many of Annie's products, but of all the skillet dinners, this one is my favorite. :) This particular dinner is made even better by the substitution of one can of low sodium V8 for part of the water that is called for in the directions. It gives this skillet more of a "tomatoey", pasta sauce flavor, and adds a little extra zip. It also seems that a full pound of ground beef is a bit much, so I only use half a pound. One word of warning though, this particular flavor is downright inedible when prepared with ground turkey. All in all, a tasty, quick dinner that even the domestically challenged such as myself can pull off!

review/summary: Great product .... try adding these ingredients
review/text: We love this product and eat it almost every week, but I've amended the recipe on the box to make it better.<br />I start by sauteing a chopped onion in some olive oil. Then, I add a package of veggie crumbles until it is cooked. I substitute tomato juice for the water and cook according to directions. If you are using canned juice and it seems too thick, you can water it down (maybe one cup juice and one cup water). Sometimes I will mix-in some shredded cheese once it is done. I think that the tomato juice really helps this meal along and gives it a great flavor. I've also used canned petite diced tomatoes instead of the juice with good results as well.

This kit is called Cheesy Lasagna and the picture on the box certainly seemed to fit the bill. What I got was something brown and not really cheesy. It tasted okay but I agree with another reviewer and would consider this more of a hamburger dish. I'll continue to try some of the other Annie's products but I will not purchase this one again.

review/text: Grew up drinking Coke and the occasional Pepsi. Cola was always my favorite drink and I stopped drinking it due to the caffeine, until I found Blue Sky. This stuff is perfect. It has everything Coke or Pepsi had going for them without the bitter hit of Coke and the sickly thin sweetness of Pepsi. I empty my local stores stock every time they stock it.<br /><br />Incidentally I also love Blue Sky Root Beer and Cherry Vanilla Creme. But their New Century Cola is a little too heavy with the molasses (they must use a darker sugar for it) for my taste.

Tastes just like my memory of a cola, but with no caffeine or HFCS, preservatives or artificial flavors or colors.  All natural, made from sugar and cola nut, with no GMO ingredients.  I have tried a few flavors and my favorites are the cola (haven't tried the new century organic one yet) and the vanilla cherry creme.

The results have been inconclusive as to whether this helps, with two of us having a split decision.  The teriyaki flavor is perfect...not too salty as I expected, and the taste, if rated separately gets 5 stars.

review/summary: dented cans
review/text: I am not finding Libby's veggies as good as I remembered them.  I am probably spoiled by the Organic and natural and more expensive brands I have been using because they are healthier.  These came in dented cans.  They are small, overcooked and soft but work ok when added to previously cooked soup or stew and just heated.

They look and feel like the old Chicklets gum---not in sticks but in sugar encased tabs or whatever you would call them. Now that Wrigley's gum has gone all artificial, this is the only game in town.

review/summary: Yes - very sticky on dental work.
review/text: Like at least one of the other reviewers, I also had severe problems with the gum sticking to my dental work. I found this gum to be impossible to chew because I have ONE crown on a molar.  The entire piece of gum stayed solidly stuck to the crown the whole time I was trying to chew it, forming a gum-coating on that one tooth.  I am sure that I can find someone to take this pack off my hands, but unfortunately, this one piece has been enough for me.  Other than that one issue, the gum seemed good and I think it would have been ok if I didnt have a crown.  :(

review/text: I was so excited when I found this gum today at a store, I had read about it and generally avoid gum because of all the crap in it.  At first I was pretty impressed with the gum, I actually understood the ingredients and it tasted pretty fresh.  Soon I noticed I couldn't move it around in my mouth because it kept getting stuck on my molars.  Within about 5 minutes, with two pieces, the flavor was gone and my jaw was hurting from fighting to get it off of my teeth.  Still, I would chew it when I am desperate for gum because the flavor is good at first and at least it isn't full of crap!

review/summary: The trick to chewing Glee:
review/text: I've found chewing three pieces at once, and consciously keeping the chicle in a manageable wad in my mouth, will help avoid sticking to areas of dental interest.<br /><br />I highly prefer chewing natural chicle to Frankengums. We'd all be better off if people chewed Glee, a great sustainable product that does not leave black circles all over the sidewalk.

review/text: Our main reason for experimenting with Glee Gum is that it seems to be the only gum on the market that is soy-free.  With soy allergies at an all-time high, and a major allergen in our own family, this gum is a welcome discovery.  The flavor does drop off faster than the artificial gums, but I haven't had any issues with it sticking to my teeth or dental work.  I have crowns and fillings, and I have no complaints at all.

review/summary: A Decent Attempt to Bring Back Classic Gum
review/text: For most of my life I loved chewing gum until the all the major companies started using artificial and unhealthy ingredients like artificial high-intensity sweeteners and sugar alcohols.  I was always on the hunt for a company that used natural flavorings and sweeteners.  When I recently found Glee Gum, the joy of chewing gum returned.  It's not perfect, but it's the best alternative on the market for people concerned about what they put in their bodies.  It's a good start, but hopefully the company will focus on producing a product whose flavor lasts longer and which stays soft longer.  As pointed out by another reviewer, if you're having problems with the gum sticking to teeth, try chewing 2 or 3 pieces at a time.  Half my mouth are caps, crowns, and bridges and I don't have a problem chewing this gum.

review/text: Unlike the other reviewer, I don't have problems with the gum sticking to my teeth.  Maybe their mouth was abnormally dry?  It has just the right amount of softness and I just love the taste and how long it lasts. The taste is not overbearing like many of the chemically laden gums.  I was trying to find a gum without all the fake sugars like all the rest have, that tasted good as well.  This is by far the best I have found. I have bought several cases of this stuff. Buy it and you will see.  Great taste without all the chemicals of other gums!!

review/summary: Glee will leave you in a sticky situation.
review/text: I initially purchased this because I wanted to try a gum that did not contain Phenylalanine.  The packaging of Glee Gum sorta reminds me of a box of chicle tab gum.  The price and flavor of the gum is pretty good, however I had a few issues:<br /><br />1. This gum WILL stick to your teeth!  It has stuck to my teeth each time I've chewed it. My friends have tried this gum and have complained about it sticking to their teeth, too.  It was difficult to remove from my back molars.  I eventually had to brush my teeth to remove all traces of gum from my mouth.<br />2. The flavor doesn't last as long as I hoped, so I wound up going through the entire package rather quickly.

review/summary: Depends on why you chew gum
review/text: I guess it depends on why you chew gum as to whether you will like Glee gum or not.  I bought my first pack today because I had read an article about it recently.  The texture is good and I don't have an issue with it sticking to any dental work but the flavor [tangerine] was gone in 5 minutes.  I chew gum to freshen my breath and give me a low cal sweet treat.  Glee gum just doesn't meet my needs.  If they could make the flavor last longer, it would be great.  Until then, this is probably the one and only box of Glee gum that I will buy.

review/summary: This is good for smoothies and coffee drinks
review/text: This powder boosts the creamy factor and vanilla flavor in blended drinks of all kinds; milkshakes, smoothies, coffee drinks -- I have even used it in pina coladas and WOW it is good.  It may have some ingredients that are probably not that great for you, but I do not drink it everyday and consider it a treat.  I have a vitamix and usually blend just fruits and veg together every morning by themselves, but treats in moderation are fine in my book.<br /><br />This powder has also saved my bacon a few times when we were out of milk for the coffee and didn't want to leave the house un-caffeinated. It is very versatile and the 3 pound bag lasts a long time, perfect to store in an airtight jar in the pantry for when you need it.<br /><br />I bought this at a restaurant supply store, not on amazon, and paid full price compared to what it is listed for on here.  I will subscribe to this on amazon when we use up our current supply and save almost 10 bucks a bag!<br /><br />PS:<br />Its title does not say "pure vanilla powder," it says it is for smoothies, so why are people mad they got smoothie mix/enhancer? Also, pure vanilla powder is about $1.35 an ounce on a good day, and this smoothie powder is 41 cents an ounce, so if this were actually a 3 pound bag of pure vanilla powder it should cost around $60 on sale.  Moral of the story: Just read the product description & ingredients list before ordering.

review/summary: You should always know what you are ordering!
review/text: This Vanilla Bean Powder is absolutely wonderful.  The only problem I have with it is the price.  Apparently others who have reviewed this item didn't know what they were getting.  It is designed to enhance the flavor of fruit smoothies.  And it does to great of a job at it (I use to much, it is so good).  When you add a few tablespoons to a blender of fruit and ice it transforms the ingredients into something wonderful.  Many independent coffee shops use this to make their smoothies.  This product was not originally even available to the general public for purchase.  It was sold in bulk to coffee shops.  I worked for a Mocafe distributer in Denver for several years and got hooked.  I will repeat:  This item is designed to be a flavor enhancer not a stand alone item in a drink.<br /><br />Granted, if you don't want sugar, you need to look elsewhere.  This stuff is loaded with it.

review/summary: Misleading Picture & product detail
review/text: The title says it's Vanilla Bean Powder, but it is not. As mentioned in previous 1-star reviews, it is basically dairy creamer with vanilla flavoring (the most faint tasting vanilla I've tasted in a long time!). The package in the picture is not the same package you recieve. The package received has a different label, one that more adequitely and accurately depicts the product's TRUE main ingreedients.<br /><br />For what I needed it for (soy vanilla bean frap), it was okay, just not what I was expecting as a customer. I was looking for ACTUAL powdered vanilla beans, and the way it was worded (AND the vanilla bean pictured on the bag online) in this ad makes it sound like that's what is being sold. I would've given it a 1-star had I not been able to use the product in another fashion, but I was.<br /><br />1 star for the misleading wording, and 1 star for the happenstance of being able to use it in another fashion = 2 stars.
