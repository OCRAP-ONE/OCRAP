review/summary: Terrific Treat
review/text: I took a chance on buying these snacks despite concerns from other reviewers that the vanilla overpowers the cashews because I really enjoy the Sahale savory nut mix trio.  I am glad I decided to make the purchase because the combination of cashew, pomegranate and vanilla come together nicely to make a tasty but not cloyingly sweet treat. With the exception of fruit, these nuts satisfy my craving for sugar without making me feel guilty, like a chocolate bar, cookies, or ice cream would.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase again.

review/summary: Cheesy, low-carb goodness
review/text: I love salty snack foods, especially cheesy ones, and one of the things that I miss most on a low-carb regime are Doritos. The Sahale Southwest Cashews have all the spicy-cheesy-salty goodness of a Dorito, but are low carb -- 10g carb per quarter-cup. They're addictive. They're quite expensive (one cup of nuts per package), but if you're not worried about what you're paying for your snack food, these are great.

review/summary: Pretty Tasty, but Not as Good as Valdosta
review/text: The Sahale Soledad mix is similar to my Sahale fave mix, Valdosta, in that it's a mixture of nuts, dried fruit, and spices, with a varied texture of chewy and crunchy and a mixture of sweet and spicy flavors, but there is something about it that I'm not quite in love with. It's not the stickiness, because I don't mind that except for the it being a bit messy if I'm snacking while on line, which I often am.<br /><br />I guess, as I've said before in my reviews of Sahale nut snacks, I think every one of them pales in comparison to the perfection of the Valdosta variety. In fact, I'm so crazy about the Sahale Valdosta mix that I posted a Haiku in praise. I know, pathetic. So, take my opinions of the other flavors with a grain of sea salt.

review/summary: The Best of the Sahale Snack Nut Blends
review/text: I really don't know how to describe Sahale's Valdosta Pecans better than L. Thorson did in reviewing the 2 ounce packages (and whre I also quoted him/her): "This is an especially felicitous blend of crunchy pecans and chewy cranberries, spiced up with a little black pepper and orange zest. Good to eat out of hand, and also good to toss into a salad for some extra flavor and texture."<br /><br />After trying this snack I'd purchased away from my usual shpping spots, I couldn't remember the name of it and bought various nut snacks of other brands that I thought may have been the same, but was repeatedly sadly disappointed. Just yesterday I found the real thing again and decided to see if I could get it from Amazon. I was successful at first, but then after receiving them and wanting to get more, found Amazon was out.

review/summary: My new favorite snack!
review/text: These are mind-blowingly delicious -- sweet, salty, tangy, and just a little exotic. The balance of flavors is just right; the combined impression is pretty bold, but no single ingredient is overpowering. It's definitely a salty snack, but the other flavors come through beautifully. Every bite has its own character -- you might get a nice little burst of chili (mild; more pungent than hot) and sweet, chewy pineapple in one bite, and then a cluster of crunchy, tangy cashews and peanuts with a hint of lemongrass in the next. Oh, and be sure to give the bag a good shake before you dig in, to distribute all the good stuff that settles at the bottom.  Enjoy!

review/text: I first purchased these Sahale snacks at Costco, and quickly became addicted to them.  When I couldn't find them any longer at Costco, I searched the internet for these tasty snacks.  I was delighted to find them available at Amazon.com.  When they arrived, I opened a pack, and was surprised at how hard the dried cranberries were.  The flavor was still good...the nuts still tasted fresh, but the cranberries took some effort to chew.  I hope this was just a bad batch, purhaps others are better.

review/text: I got addicted to Sahale's snacks from the Tully's Coffee that was downstairs at work.  After pretty much buying them out they didn't restock in enough time so I decided to take matters into my own hands and buy in bulk from Amazon.  My 3 favorites are Socorro, Ksar and Soledad.  If you want a healthy snack that tastes like you're indulging in sinful goodness then this is the snack for you.<br /><br />I give these a 4 because sometimes the almonds are a little over roasted for my tastes but all the girls at work seem to like this one the most so they must know something I don't.

review/summary: Utterly marvelous -- best of the Sahale nut snacks
review/text: These match the excellent quality of the same product from a local store, as do the "Soledad" almonds.  It is difficult to keep from eating the whole pricey bag at one sitting. These are the Sahale Snacks that sell out first in the store.  Friends likewise agree that these are the best.  For some reason, in my recent shipment, these "Valdosta" pecans and the "Soledad" almonds were as good as the ones from the store, but the "Soccorro" Macadamia / hazelnut and the "Dauphine" Walnut / blueberry snacks were stale-tasting, even rancid, especially the walnuts, this despite being two to five months pre-expiration date.

review/summary: Mostly just really sweet cashews
review/text: The combination sounded wonderful and the picture was enticing but that isn't exactly what I received.  The cashews were crunchy and very sweet but I had a hard time finding the pomegranate like in the photo or even near it.  First 2 handfuls there was nada.  At the end there was a little which added an almost discernable tartness (which was why I bought them) and some sprinklings in the bottom of the bag but all very tiny.  Disappointed as I didn't buy simple, sweet cashews..could have gotten those in a larger quantity and for cheaper (and prefer the usual honey flavor of other brands to this vanilla).  I wasn't impressed. (I bought mine at a local grocery store and they were fresh.)

review/text: I love nuts and almonds among my favorites. When I saw the description of Sahale almonds I was so excited to try it. All the ingredients looked just delicious so I've got a subscription on it. Unfortunately now, when I got my first batch of them and tried, I have to cancel it. Every time I eat them I have a heartburn. Not sure what exactly causes it because I'm fine with pure almonds, sea salt (at least with the one I have at home), honey, cranberries, no known food allergies. It might be salt/nuts/cranberries combination that causes it, not sure.

I actually was checking the internet to see if the company had stopped producing them when I discovered that Amazon sells them! This is my best flavor of all fo the Sahale Snacks.

review/summary: So Good!
review/text: These little nuts are so delicious, I can't even describe it.  When I think of glazed nuts, I think of overly sweet totally crystallized with sugar.  It almost held be back from buying these, but they are nothing like that. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to sample them before buying, otherwise I never would have.  They are the perfect amount of sweetness with real fruit pieces that taste like fruit and vanilla!  I would highly recommend these to everyone. Very filling too, unlike most snacks.  You only need to eat a few pieces and you don't feel icky after eating them.

review/summary: New favorite box macaroni and cheese.
review/text: In my opinion this is the best tasting mac&cheese that comes in a box hand-down if you make it right. 2 tbsp butter and a about a 1/4 cup of yogurt (I just do a big scoop so that is a guess on size). If you are just using milk, then I would say Kraft mac&cheese is better than.<br />I do buy this stuff on amazon, but normally I buy it at the store whenever it goes on sale for Buy-one-get-one-free. I got it on amazon for ~$18 per dozen, at the grocery store I can get it for ~$15 per dozen (on sale).<br />Do realize that even though Annie's kind of sells stuff like it is healthier for you, this is still mac&cheese. No matter how you make it this really isn't any healthier than any other mac&cheese. Look at the fiber count, it is not whole grains. It is certified organic if you are into that marketing trend. I buy this not expecting health food so it loses no points with me.<br />I am however giving it four stars because the price is ~15% less and the grocery store when it goes on a good sale.

review/summary: There is a constant PROBLEM with GLUE in Annie's mac & cheese
review/text: I buy quality, more natural mac & cheese quite regularly and was a long time customer of Annie's products. Unfortunately I often found that glue and other contaminants (which spark when heated) made it into the finished products Annie's sells. I contacted the company about this and was ignored twice before receiving a very brief a reply that there was no danger to the consumer. Call me skeptical but eating glue (it's probably from the sealant used on the box tops) caked to the pasta does not seem to me like a good idea, and I wasn't exactly thrilled with Annie's customer service, which was mostly dismissive (ignored my first two missives to them). There are plenty of great products and companies out there. I buy Back To Nature mac & cheese now, and actually prefer their spirals with white cheddar to Annie's shells and white cheddar.  These also cook much faster than Annie's shells, which always seem to take extra long to cook fully. No sense taking a chance on eating toxic substances when looking for a healthier alternative to the chemically heavy products from Kraft and the like.

review/text: As far as boxed products go, this is by far the best.  There is no substitute and no imitation.  If you follow the directions (including the butter), you can't go wrong.  I have found that the sauce can get lumpy if not done right so it seems to work best if made in a separate sauce pan and added later.  Of course, it may say that on the box, but I've never looked.  This is just trial and error here.  Much better than Kraft mac n cheese though only this variety.  The other Annie's don't compare.

review/text: I don't think you will find a lot of homes that eat more macaroni than mine does. We love it in just about anyway we can think to cook it, so to find this product was a real plus for us.<br /><br />"Annie's Homegrown Shells & White Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese," is great for many reasons.  I have to say the first would be the taste.  A little bit lighter than the traditional ones leaves you feeling not quite as stuffed but you still enjoy the smooth flavor of real cheese, white chedder. This product has no chemicals, no MSG, in other words none of the things that have no business being put in our bodies in the first place. That is definitely a plus in any product,don't you think?<br /><br />Listen, this is some good stuff and a product you should definitely give a try. If you love macaroni and cheese and don't want to feel guilty having a big heaping of it this one is for you.  Quick to fix too. Enjoy!

But then on the other hand, I also like both Stouffer's and Trader Joe's frozen, and I even like the stuff in the "blue box."  Read a lot of rave reviews of Annie's, so I picked up a box at the store today.  I'm not sure what kind of mac and cheese the people that loved this stuff have eaten in the past, but I found Annie's watery and bland.  I think it might be passable if there was twice the amount of cheese powder, but this stuff had no flavor.  Ate a couple bites and threw the rest out.  Luckily I only bought one box, but it was a complete waste of money.  Even Easy Mac is better.

review/text: don't see how this is listed, with several other similar products from the same company, as "prepared meal"; you don't have milk or yogurt, no go; to me, that definition is met by, for instance, some of the pad thai nuker boxes; open noodle package, sauce package, combine in box, nuke 2min and ready to eat;  what this amounts to is a company selling a very small amount of pasta that's wildly overpriced compared to a standard box in the s'market- and still needs to be cooked the same way, no nuking short cuts- plus a tiny package of dried cheese sauce; don't get it; it's not nukable, not quick, not complete

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: These noodles are fantastic. I could eat them for dinner almost every night of the week along with their other Annie's counterparts. Cooked meal in less than 30 minutes. You cannot beat the taste! I love adding coconut oil and chia seeds to them as well. It only enhances the flavor and adds some nutritional extras if you so desire. They are fine the way they come but I find this adds something extra and they taste amazing prepared this way.

review/summary: pasta is okay, but sauce was flavorless
review/text: I agree with the other reviewer who called this bland.  While eating this, it seemed like I was eating boiled noodles with a little milk poured on top.  I couldn't taste ANY cheese flavor.<br /><br />For those who don't want to make their own mac & cheese, basically ANY brand of frozen mac & cheese is better than this box mix -- and most frozen mac & cheese meals aren't very good, either.  Best pre-prepared mac & cheese:  a tie between Amy's (VERY strong cheese flavor) and Trader Joe's "reduced guilt" (you can tell there's real cheese in it, though the cheese they use isn't as sharp as I'd like).  Yes, both of these are more expensive than this box mix, but if you're willing to eat this stuff you really should just buy your pasta separately and then sprinkle some grated parmesan cheese on top; you'll save money and at least you'll get some cheese flavor.

review/summary: yummy with  yogurt
review/text: We love making this "mac and cheese" using yogurt instead of milk and butter.  That makes it very thick and creamy.  The shells are a nice variation on macaroni, gathering more cheese in the "insides".  The ingredients list on the box is also much simpler and "wholesome" than the name brand mac and cheese.  (Though we usually need to make 2 or three boxes to feed all the kids.)

review/text: I like Annie's products...just not her purple box on this one:) The only thing that I really don't like about this product is that it needs more sauce. It's pretty light flavored and delicate.  If I don't cook all the macaroni in the box it's better. I may try doctoring the sauce a little to produce more flavor.

review/summary: The New Standard
review/text: Time was when Kraft macaroni and cheese was the bachelor's best friend.  Whether I've changed my tastes as I've gotten older or if they've just crappified the ingredients in that product, the adult me needed something with some real flavor to it.  Annie's is the best powder mix product I've found.  My teenage son appreciates the higher quality as well.<br /><br />If you buy this on a subscription you get a lower price and free shipping, which makes it far more affordable than it is at the health food store in the next town from me, and they often don't have the standard size box that I prefer.

(Also, try the Shells & Wisconsin Cheddar -- it's just as good but with a sharp cheddar twang!)

review/summary: Great Mac & Cheese
review/text: Annie's Mac & Cheese is delicious. As a kid, I used to eat Kraft and Annie's and not really notice a difference. Now that I'm a bit older, I realize how much better Annie's is. And even though it's not incredibly healthy, it's still somewhat healthier than Kraft is (more organic). It is a little more expensive, but is definitely worth the extra money. You can find it on here for cheaper than the grocery stores often, and using prime and the subscribe and save option makes it the best way to buy Annie's.

review/summary: tried it due to kroger $.50 sale to see if I should buy 10...
review/text: And it was pretty meh.  Priced at $1 per box at kroger, this week if you buy 10 you get $5 off so it would be $.50 a box.  I was hoping it would taste great! But the less then positive reviews were right, against the hype.  I do like that its natural and organic...but it needs way more cheese!  Although the shells that had a bit more cheese on them tasted good, the overall taste seemed like I added too much milk, even though I used far less than the recommended 1/4 cup.  I give it a meh rating.  I would also go so far as to say these should have a regular price of that $.50 as well, sad to say.  I am curious about the other varieties though...sure wish it had more cheese...

review/text: Don't get me wrong, I love this mac n' cheese.  BUT, I think it's really bland without adding anything.  When I eat it, I add a can of tuna and mix some parmesan cheese in with the sauce before I mix it with the noodles to make it thicker.  This makes the sauce stick better to the noodles.

review/summary: Annie's Homegrown Shells & White Cheddar
review/text: Let's not kid ourselves - this ISN'T healthy food.  We all know that, and we don't make Mac and Cheese because we think it's healthy.  We make it because it's a nice, tummy-filling comfort food.  It's time for some facts, Jack.  Comparing the 7 oz box of Annie's to the 7.25 oz box of Kraft, you'll find there's not much difference.  Where there is a difference, Annie's does not come out on top often.  These numbers are per serving for the mix, not prepared (adding milk and/or butter):<br /><br />Calories - Kraft 260... Annie's 270<br />Total fat - Kraft 2.5g... Annie's 4.5g<br />Saturated fat - Kraft 1g... Annie's 2.5g<br />Sodium - Kraft 580mg... Annie's 550mg<br />Total Carbs - Kraft 49g... Annie's 48g<br />Protein - Kraft 9g... Annie's 10g<br /><br />They have the same Cholesterol (10mg) and the same Trans Fat (0) and Kraft has twice the Calcium (20% RDA to Annie's 10% RDA) and more Iron (10% RDA to Annie's 6% RDA), although Annie's has 2% RDA of Vitamin A to Kraft's 0.  Annie's gets away with claiming their prepared product has fewer calories and less fat by suggesting you NOT add butter - you could easily do the same with Kraft.  (I make it with butter, myself, and don't use milk at all with either one because I don't like it water-y.)<br /><br />Beyond the facts, there's the matter of taste.  To me, Annie's is bland.  That actually makes it an okay side dish, just not much of a meal.  It's not horrible, it's just boring.  Annie's powder is a little clumpy - I assume this is the oil in the cheese - and I suggest you follow the actual directions or you'll end up with clumps of cheese.<br /><br />If you're a diehard macaroni and cheese fan, Annie's doesn't quite cut it.  If you're looking for a healthy mac and cheese, make it from scratch and by-pass ALL the brands (it won't be healthy, but it's closer!).  If you just want something different, Annie's is okay.  Little ones will enjoy Annie's, no matter what.  The shells are fun and different and when they're little, fun and different is important!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/summary: Alfredo Shells
review/text: Similar in taste to an Alfredo sauce, the White Cheddar cheese sauce tastes delicious with the tiny shell pasta.<br /><br />Ingredients: Durum Semolina, water, cheddar cheese, milk, salt, whey, buttermilk, butter.<br /><br />The 7-ounce box is enough for one to two people depending on how hungry<br /><br />you are at the time. You can make this as directed or while the pasta is draining, put the pan/pot back on the stove and melt 1-2 tablespoons of butter and then add the milk (or you can use half-and-half to make it dreamy creamy) and packet of powdered cheese sauce. Add the pasta back into the sauce and serve with a sprinkling of freshly grated parmesan and freshly ground pepper.<br /><br />No Chemicals<br /><br />No MSG<br /><br />No anything that isn't good for you...just tasty delish.<br /><br />Probably the only box of macaroni and cheese with a bumper sticker on the side saying:<br /><br />"Be Green<br /><br />Help the Earth Live"<br /><br />I like the cute "Rabbit of Approval" sticker on the Annie's Homegrown products. They are all delicious (not overly salty like other brands, you know who I'm talking about) and you feel good eating such a healthy product.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Puts The Blue Box To Shame
review/text: Here's the thing kids: if you are looking for gourmet dishes out of a box you're not going to find them.  Is it as good as homemade mac & cheese?  No.  It's not trying to be.  Is it light years ahead of regular "blue box" mac & cheese?  Heck to the yeah.  When you properly compare this to other foods in it's realm like Top Ramen, other boxed macaroni and cheese, spaghetti-os, or beanie weenie--Annie's is the gold standard.  I'm willing to drive 100 miles to the nearest store that carries it to buy it.  I was stoked to see it available in bulk, with free shipping on Amazon and don't feel the price is a problem.  It's the BMW of boxed Mac & Cheese, you're going to pay a few cents more.  Obviously though, if you don't like Mac & Cheese from a box (my husband calls it Yellow Death) then you most likely won't like this either.
