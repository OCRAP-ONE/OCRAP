review/summary: Delicious Alternative to Sugar
review/text: If you are looking for a sweetener that is delicious in tea, Stevia can be used to sweeten hot or cold tea. You can almost say goodbye to regular sugars in your drinks once you get a taste for the Stevia powder.<br /><br />Unlike artificial sweeteners, Stevia is never bitter and won't leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth. The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.<br /><br />By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game. Every single time you use one packet of Stevia, you are using less sugar and you won't even miss it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Great Price for Great Sweetener!
review/text: A nutritionist recommended these to sweeten my coffee etc. as there are no negative after effects unlike artificial sweeteners.  Stevia is made from herb in South America. Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.<br /><br />I like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa--it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie-free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.<br /><br />This multi-pack offer for this price is about 30% lower than what I can get NuStevia for locally.

review/text: Are these people crazy or can I not multiple properly? This is $43 for 24 small cups of peaches.  That works out to $7 for the 4 pack.  This 4 pack cost about $3.50 in a grocery store in the states but because I'm deployed I'm suppose to pay $7 for it?! Not happening. Netgrocer.com is $4.00; higher than a grocercy store, but cheaper than this!

review/summary: Raspberry Dream Tea
review/text: Take the warm scent of Italian Bergamot and blend it with natural raspberry flavor and swirl it into South Indian black tea and what you are creating is a raspberry dream of a tea. This tea, if made with powdered milk, honey or a packet of stevia becomes creamy.<br /><br />Top with vanilla whipped cream and you have a vanilla raspberry bergamot tea. This is the perfect for tea parties or sipping in the morning while enjoying a raspberry muffin.<br /><br />The people who pick the tea leaves are paid a fair wage and the positive energy really does come through in the flavor of the tea. The tea leaves are also organic.<br /><br />I think this is the most delicious tea I've ever tasted! Once you try this flavor, you will want to try all the flavors. I also love the Fireside Chai.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Gluten free, vegan, kosher, and very concentrated.
review/text: O.k., so it's not officially kosher--but this is how you make gelatin without cow's hooves, for those of you who get grossed out by Jell-O if you think about it too much.<br /><br />Now foods is a company that sells gluten-free stuff, and this is no exception:  if you have celiac this won't make you sick.<br /><br />Even better, this is powdered agar agar, not flaked agar agar.  That means this will last for months, if not years--although it's also easy to use too much. 1 tablespoon of the flakes = 1/2 tsp of the powder.  The ratio most cooks call for is 1 cup liquid to 1 teaspoon flaked agar agar, which means 1/4 tsp of this powder to 1 cup liquid, with more added for more acidic things like orange juice.<br /><br />However, agar agar doesn't gel as well as Jell-o, so don't expect to get the same results that you would for Jell-o--for that, you need Jell-o or kosher gelatin.  (You can add more agar agar to add firmness; but then it starts to taste like what it is:  seaweed.)

review/summary: Its agar
review/text: I received the agar about 12 days after ordering. It comes in a slightly different bottle now, but I assume its the same agar agar as before. The bottle has a snap lid (I'm not so sure about the quality of the seal so I keep the agar agar in an airtight container just as a precaution). I dont plan on eating any of this, but I have used this successfully with mycology experiments in petri dishes (the agar is light enough to see everything well in the dish) so it works great for that.

review/summary: Great Vegan Alternative
review/text: Agar is basically gelatin for vegans, (or vegetarians.) Regular gelatin is usually animal-based, and is made from leftover body parts of animals that would otherwise be thrown away. Sound appetizing? Agar is a cruelty-free alternative, and is a great aid anytime a thickened creamy base is required, usually in baking. I use this for many cream pies as well as other desserts.

I didn't have much luck when microwaving it, but if you boil it like it says on the bottle it firms up quite nicely. Bear in mind, you must add soy milk to make the pore strips. The agar simply doesn't have the ability on it's own.

The Amazon price is the best, subscribe and save is new and brings the price down to an irresistible buy, which is even more special since these cookies are not always at the grocery

review/summary: Pretty good chicken gumbo
review/text: Progresso's chicken gumbo soup doesn't taste all that great when it comes out of the microwave (or off the stove, if that's your way), but it tastes pretty good. It has white meat chicken, kidney beans, okra, rice, celery, carrot, tomato, and red bell pepper in it, as you can see from the picture on the can. Check the picture I uploaded to see what the soup *actually* looks like in the bowl. The chicken was pretty firm and just right, in my bowl. The gumbo taste isn't bad. You won't feel like you're in Louisiana or Memphis while you're eating it (unless you're actually IN Louisiana or Memphis), but it has the distinctive gumbo taste and is really quite good compared to some of Progresso's other soups. My biggest complaint with this soup is that the green vegetables came out mushy, as they tend to with Progresso soups, I've found. The celery and okra were good, just very soft and mushy, which isn't really what I wanted. It did a pretty good job of filling me up, though, as they pack a whole lot into that can as always. Overall a good soup that I wouldn't mind buying more of if I see it on the shelves sometime.

What I got was a rellette that lacked even flavor of duck and herbs/spices. The texture was good however. Tasted more like a pork rillette. I would not recommend Rouge Perigord Duck Rillettes.

review/text: I love this tea. I hated my friends asking me if I was pregnant. I decided to diet but wasn't easy. I was always hungry and at bedtime I couldn't help it and ended up with a plate of ice cream... no good. I decided to give this tea a try and I stopped feeling hungry all the time. The taste is great. I have lost ten pounds in almost two months. I walked al least an hour per day, I only have fruits and tea in the mornings, salad and protein for lunch and fresh smoothies without sugar for dinner. If I feel hungy I have a fruit or raw vegetable. I put chopped garlic on my salads, it gets rid of waste too. I dont diet on weekends but my stomach is smaller so I get full with less and less food. I am buying this for my sister It has been awesome for me. thanks!

review/summary: A decent spice rub for red meats...
review/text: As a spice mix fan, I make a point of trying multiple products on food - both fun and fattening in equal measure!  I've also highlighted what I think are the standout mixes in Chef Tom's line: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>.<br /><br />That said, this mix is a delicious treat, but it doesn't hold the attention of the taste buds like the standouts.  The primary notes are supposedly ancho chiles and smoked paprika, but overall the tastes are muddled and don't provide a 'zing' to the dish.<br /><br />It's a very tasty addition on multiple items such as tri-tip and pot roast but not enough to justify the gourmet price.  It is also too heavy a mix to work well on chicken, fish, or to drizzle over a meat-pasta dish.<br /><br />Note: Surprisingly, the best pairings from Chef Tom for red meats are either the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5NKUK">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Pork Rub</a> or a generous portion of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>.

review/summary: Slightly Spicy
review/text: Tom Douglas, a famous Seattle chef, has created a spicy steak rub that is especially delicious. I rub this seasoning on the best filet mignon I can find. Then I cook the steaks in a little oil. One thing about this seasoning is it is made with brown sugar. This means your steak is going to burn a bit unless you keep the heat on medium or lower. When I use this steak rub I tend to cook the steaks a little on each side and then I cut them up into smaller pieces and continue frying. This guarantees that they won't burn. To be honest I can't really taste the rosemary in this mix, the peppers are much more prominent. My husband loves to eat the steaks with a little Tiger Sauce. He thinks that makes them just perfect. I have also tried the Salmon rub and the Chicken rub and have found them all to be delicious.<br /><br />~ The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Great glass!  Great Tea!
review/text: I was skeptical because I've seen mixed reviews on similar products like this.  But I'm glad I jumped in and decided to purchase it.  First of all the shipping was fast and it comes gift-wrapped free which is cool.  Second, the glass works great which is most important.  Its double-walled so when I poured my boiling hot water in the glass I had no problem carrying it from the kitchen to my bedroom and barely feeling any warmth.  The filter/strainer does exactly what its supposed to do which is keep the loose tea out of your mouth while you drink your tea.  This is the first time I've used something like this and it works perfectly for me.<br /><br />The blooming tea comes in three small containers.  I'm new to tea so I can't tell what kind it is...most likely some type of jasmine green tea because it smells good.  The first steeping is very mild but the second one the flavor really comes out.  Anyway I hope this helps people that are on the fence like I was about buying glasses like this.  This package is legit and well worth the price.

review/text: This walnut oil is the best on the market. It has been roasted which enhances the walnut flavor. I love it with scrambled eggs and in preparing rice dishes. I've even used it to condition my hair! I completely trust Roland Foods because they are superior in every way.

review/summary: Overpriced - not 18lb bags!
review/text: When I bought this food, I saw the image and price and assumed that I would be paying a fair price ($1 less per bag than the grocery store) for low grade cat food. The image and price combination led me to think that I would be paying $45 for 6 18lb+ bags - a good deal. When I received six 3.6lb bags, I thought there had been a mistake. Nope. So, I spend $40+ returning it (I bought three 6 packs - oops) and now Ozbo customer service tells me they take 2-3 weeks processing returns! My kitties need food now, and these people want to sit on my $180 for that long? DO NOT BUY FROM THESE SCAMMERS !!!

review/summary: Great grain free food
review/text: If you're looking for a great grain free alternative to beef or chicken, this is it. My two girls loved it. We used to put some in their Kongs, then put in dry food and then seal the end with more wet food and put it in the freezer so that dinner would become more of a challenge. The only con with this food is that it can be pricey, as are most Wellness products. You could probably get the same results you're looking for from a grain free food with something like Taste of the Wild, which is what we've gone to because of cost.

review/summary: Low-cost Latte
review/text: Medaglia D'Oro Instant Espresso Coffee is by far the best way to make a latte in the comfort of your home and it's also the cheapest!  I use it to make an awesome vanilla latte - just put two (2) spoonfuls of the Medaglia D'Oro espresso in a coffee cup and add about 2 shots of hot water and mix.  Place a shot of vanilla syrup in a tall glass(more or less according to individual taste). Next add enough cubed [not crushed]ice to fill the glass 2/3rds of the way up.  Then fill the glass with enough cold milk to cover the ice.  Pout the hot coffee mix over the milk and ice and stir vigorously until mixed.  Add more ice as needed and then pour enough half and half to color the coffee mix to a yummy caramel color.  Delicious and cheaper than the espresso stands (once you have the ingredients on hand).  Medaglio is also great in recipes that call for instant espresso.  Not all stores carry this product so I order from Gristedes through Amazon.com.

review/summary: Much better than I expected
review/text: I haven't bought this online yet (I just saw it here for the first time today), but I've been buying it locally for almost a year now. I originally bought it for a mocha dessert recipe in the South Beach Diet book. I tried it to make a latte and was pleasantly surprised. I hadn't expected much from instant espresso based on past experience with instant coffees. This is actually very good. I have only used it for lattes and mochas. I don't do espresso by the shot. I particularly like it when I go camping. I've shared it with fellow campers who also liked it. The flavor is rich and can be adjusted to taste by varying the amount per cup. It also has a light froth on top. I recommend it highly.

review/summary: SOOOoo Good and VERY versitile
review/text: I love coffee, but I also love not having to messing with the coffee maker sometimes.  This instant espresso is the best I have tried and I have tried about 7 different brands.<br /><br />Not overly acidic at all, melts instantly in hot water (no sand dunes left swirling at the top if your cup), travels wonderfully (compact jar) and is very versitile to have around for cooking:<br /><br /> -- I but a tsp. in a batch of brownies to deepen the dark chocolate flavor<br /><br /> -- I put a Tbs in a BIG batch of chili to compliment the spices and add extra richness.<br /><br /> -- I add a bit to mexican mole sauce for punch.<br /><br /> -- I also put it in: chocolate granache icing, chai tea with milk for a java chai latte, coffee drink mixes for extra umph, etc.<br /><br />It is over 5 bucks at some supermarkets, when/if you can even find it, so it is nice to know it is cheaper at amazon!

review/text: I received a jar of this Instant Espresso as a gift from my mother-in-law.  I was quite "insulted" at first, as I've never used instant coffee of any kind and couldn't figure out why she gave it to me! Then this past weekend, I was out of coffee beans & this was all I had (must have coffee in morning).  So I made it, & WOW, it was awesome!! In fact, I'm drinking a mug of it right now as I right this review! I LOVE IT!!  However, I make it in more of a latte fashion.  I've also added hot chocolate to it for a mocha latte.  I'll definitely be looking for it at my neighborhood stores, and if I can't find it, I'll be getting it here on Amazon. Definitely a great buy!!

review/summary: Versatile "must-have" for your pantry
review/text: This instant coffee is a versatile ingredient. You can add it to ice cream you are freezing (or gelato or sorbet) or you can add it to chocolate icing to make mocha flavor. It is the ingredient to have when the recipe calls for "one cup of strong, cold coffee."<br /><br />As a beverage on its own, it is a bit more acid than fresh espresso. But as a mix with milk, it works wonderfully well. You won't make a barrista cup of espresso with instant, but you will have a great way to make a latte in a pinch and for regular cooking, I personally am never without this jar on my shelf.

I originally needed it for a brownie recipe and looked here to purchase, but I saw the $9.99 price and that certainly made me take a ride to the store.  Luckily, it was on the shelf and at a very reasonable price.  Only one store in the area stocks it.<br /><br />Check your local stores before you buy this online.  Chances are you will find it at a very lesser price locally.  I use it now not just in brownies, but I add two teaspoons to a protein shake, and it makes a great coffee shake.<br /><br />Thank you.

review/text: I love the strong coffee flavor of this for baking, and have been using it for nearly 20 years in my chocolate chip cookies and other recipes.<br /><br />It's also tasty to drink, For a portable mix, I'll use instant dry milk, this coffee, a bit of unsweetened cocoa and a bit of sweetener. Then just add boiling water and stir well to make a drinkable instant latte. It's not bitter or burnt tasting like some instant coffees can be.<br /><br />While it doesn't taste as good as a pulled shot of espresso, it's one of the best instant coffees I've ever tried. It's ability to mix well into baked goods ensure it's spot in my pantry.

review/text: I wanted to have an instant coffee for work.  I don't like the standard company coffee at work. I came across Medaglia D'Oro in a HEB store in Houston.  It just looks more interesting than coffee.  I was actually hoping it wouldn't be as strong as espresso but not as watered down as instant coffee. I am glad I bought it.  It has the same consistency at espresso but not as strong in taste.  I am probably using more water that what is suggested on the directions.  I work 3rd shift, so I think it is fitting the bill of keeping me awake!  True espresso drinkers may think it is kind of weak but it would do in a pinch.  I will use this for flavoring drinks & desserts also.

review/summary: Great Sauce
review/text: This sauce has one of the best flavors I've ever tasted.  There's a good balance between spice and garlic.  It has decent heat and tastes good on a lot of things.  I'm not a big fan of most Habanero sauces due to the extra bitterness of the pepper but this sauce blends everything perfectly.

review/summary: Roses Lime Juice the "Original"
review/text: Roses Lime Juice has that lime flavor that the knock-offs do not have.  Roses has just the right amount of sugar so that it's not too sweet. Great for making any kind of gimlet...vodka, gin or even tequila (my favorite).  Since liquor is expensive don't settle for less than the "Original" !

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: I purchased this as a gamble, because there was NO product information listed, so I had no idea how much I was getting or exactly what was in it.  I was disappointed that the  "large" tin, was not all that large.  It was a round tin, approximately 4 inches tall, and maybe 7 or 8 inches across.  I was hoping that Large, especially for the price, would be one of the large and tall tins.  It's difficult to tell from the picture.  The product itself was good, but for the price, I was expecting more.  I'd probably buy from them again.

review/text: This is the best of the ready-made kinds.  In my experience, the powdered kinds are truly awful.  The other ready-made brands taste like pure yellow mustard. This one is made with horseradish and no real wasabi, but it works well with sushi.<br /><br />It also makes a great cocktail sauce for shrimp when mixed with plain old Ketchup and a pinch of Old Bay Seafood Seasoning.

review/summary: Economical and my cat loves it
review/text: Cats are finicky animals and what one loves another won't touch - that is not a reflection on the food itself. I have two Burmese and their eating habits are very different. My local Pet Nutrition Center kindly gave me a sample of Prowl the other day and while my one cat absolutely loves it, the other won't touch it. That's why samples are nice. Both of my cats have been on Evo kibble, but this one cat who now loves the Prowl, has a habit of throwing up and I'm on the prowl myself for an alternative food that will help her keep food down. So far, no barf. She also laps it up as soon as I've added warm water - no waiting. I highly recommend you obtain a sample and let the cat decide, as the food is economical as well as healthy.

review/summary: Less expensive, high quality food
review/text: I feed prowl because it is a high quality healthy food that does not break my budget.  It is much cheaper than other premium wet foods (Wellness, Weruva, etc), and my cat seems to like it.  The only downside to prowl is that, since it is dehydrated, you must mix it with water and wait 10 minutes before serving.  My kitten meows at me the entire time.<br />I started my cat on Prowl because my vet offered a free sample. She ate it right away with no problems.  However, she'd only ever had "healthy" food, so I was not transitioning from an unhealthy grain filled (but addictively tasty) food.<br />It is very easy to digest and may be a solution for cats with digestion problems.  I recommend (like another reviewer) that you order a free sample and give it a try.

Last year with all the wildfires I decided to load my camper as a quick bug out vehicle for me and my three dogs. I have been vacum sealing thier dry blue buffalo kibble but it takes up a lot of room. I read a review about this dehydrated dog food from a person takes thier dog camping all time and this was the perfect solution for them and decided to give it a try. My dogs let me know its supper time when I get home now because they are all about this food.

review/text: She's not a particularly food-driven dog, so I've tried lots of organic/natural foods. One that she consistently loves is any kind of Addiction's raw dehydrated food. She can barely contain herself while it rehydrates a bit. So much so, that I've started using hot water to speed the process along; otherwise, it's just such drama while she waits for it. This dehydrated option takes up so little room compared to dealing with clunky cans, and as long as she's happy, I'm happy. I try a different flavor everytime I order just to keep her interested. So far, so good!

A friend recently told me about Addiction and this is the answer for us - takes up little space in our cupboard and provides a healthy diet, along with a mixture of Wysong Epigen kibble, and fresh fruits and vegetables that our Cairn loves; he's a very happy camper!  The cats at home love it, too!  We've only tried Brushtail but get the Venison treats for variety.  I'm sure we'll try the others, too, for a change up from time to time - (done in moderation and over a period of time so as not to upset the tummies!)!!!!

review/summary: Even cats love it...
review/text: Note that I'm not recommending you feed your cat dog food on any kind of regular basis: the two types of animals generally need different kinds of foods and nutrients. However, at the time I was having trouble finding cat-specific dehydrated food that I thought my cats would tolerate, and this was the one dehydrated food I found that included a high amount of protein *and* specifically mentioned taurine on the label, which cats need, so I decided to use it temporarily. The cats absolutely adore it. I've since found a cat-specific flavor from the same company, but I'll probably use a little of this now and then as variety.<br /><br />The cats' coats look and feel shiny and healthy, and they definitely vomit less than when fed more mainstream foods. I also mixed it with some straight ground raw meat/organs/bone to make sure they were getting plenty of meat. The wild brushtail certainly seems to agree with them as a protein source, and there are precious few protein sources that don't make them sick (I'm limited to chicken, turkey, rabbit, and a small amount of fish usually). Because the brushtail is wild it isn't grain fed, and thus should have plenty of the right nutrients. Also, according to the company, it's an overpopulated nuisance pest, so this is a responsible way to help conserve the forests brushtail devour and the animals that live there. What's not to love?

review/text: I started out by purchasing the 4 oz trial package of Summer Brushtail and my little girl absolutely LOVED it!!  Now I am getting the larger package so we don't run out.  My Chinese Crested suffers allergies to poultry and grains and was pretty much limited to a red meat diet.  Since she is a hairless variety she was on a red meat formula coated in herring oil for her skin.  The herring left her with fish breath all the time.  This is a great alternative to the fish because the richness in omega 3 and 6 fatty acids and no more fish breath!!  Since she has been on this her skin quality is much better.  This is also great to mix with kibble if you have a picky little eater like I do, just mix a tbsp up in the kibble and you end up with a happy plate every time.

While it is not quite as rich as the Rossa, it is still has plenty of rich chocolatey flavor, is beautifully smooth and not at all bitter.  The only downside I have is the price tag and the need to buy it buy the can (rather than the vacuum packet).  Its a full $3 more than I pay for the same amount of Rossa.  It is by far the best decaf that I have ever drunk.

It's rich, it has flavor, the crema is excellent! I have signed up for the auto shipment of this and couldn't be happier.

I use a Jura Capresso super automatic to make my espresso- it works lovely in the bypass funnel on this machine (since it is pre-ground). The flavor stands up nice to milk for capuccinos and lattes. This is my every day decaf espresso. I haven't found anything better and I've tried a lot. The Illy decaf is comperable in flavor/ quality but at about double the price the Illy just isn't worth it.

review/text: This is excellent espresso and works great in my DeLonghi EC155.  In a side-by-side taste test, I can barely discern any difference between this and the Lavazza inBlu variety.  Both have lovely crema, aroma and flavor.  I have been drinking a LOT of espresso lately and this excellent decaf allows me to do so without being jittery or losing sleep.<br /><br />If you are new to making espresso, save yourself some stress and start with this.  One of the keys to gaining proficiency is reducing the variables.  Yes, grinding beans yourself will get you slightly fresher espresso, but when there are problems what do you need to fix?  The grind?  The roast?  Your tamping?  The espresso maker?  Once you are proficient with this excellent expertly ground espresso, you will be in a much better position to experiment with grinding your own.

review/text: I thought I didn't care for decaf espresso since it always had a bitter flavor that ranged from a moderate undertone to an overwhelming bite. I enjoy strong-flavored coffee, but bitter coffee is another story.<br /><br />Well, it turns out that I was just drinking the wrong stuff. Lavazza decaf is absolutely delightful. Strong, full-bodied, but no bitterness. Nice crema, smooth and rich. Really hits the spot!<br /><br />It does, however, have a bit more caffeine than other decafs. Not much, but I can feel it a bit (I'm very sensitive to caffeine - if you're not, you probably won't notice it). Not enough that it causes a problem. But even if it did, I'd probably still drink this - it's that good!<br /><br />Highly recommend.

At the same time I placed this order, I also ordered some Lavazza non-decaf espresso, which frankly doesn't seem to be as good as the Illy I've been using. For half the price, though, I can probably suffer through the decreased quality.<br /><br />If you're drinking it straight, probably not a good choice. If you're mixing it, it's more than adequate.
