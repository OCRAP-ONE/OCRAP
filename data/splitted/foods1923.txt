review/summary: Love these!
review/text: These pouches are a godsend. I keep a stockpile in the pantry and in the car. Even on days when my two-year-old is feeling particularly picky, he will eat these up without blinking an eye. I love that they are made with organic ingredients with TWO green vegetables -- peas and green beans -- in one pouch, not to mention the pear for fruit. I also like that the salba is included in these pouches for the omega 3s and extra fiber. I had never heard of salba before, but it is a very nutritious grain that I'm glad to have in my son's diet. These pouches are dairy-free, nut-free and gluten-free too, so I never had to worry about them affecting my son's food sensitivities, although he has now outgrown most of them. All in all a great product and the flavor is a winner, even with my picky son!

review/summary: Easy, safe, delicious baby food
review/text: I have been ordering Happy Tot food for the past six months via Subscribe and Save.  My son devours all of the combinations.  They are so easy to use.  Recently my son stopped taking food from a spoon, but he will let me squirt the pouches into his mouth.  I've also used the fruit blends in my older sons' smoothies.

review/summary: so easy- both baby & toddler LOVE it!
review/text: I needed an alternative to making my own baby food when I found these pouches at Target. It was SUPER easy to warm up the food just by putting the pouch in warm water, then serve to my baby. First I gave it to him using a spoon, but then he was reaching for the pouch so I just gave it to him! He absolutely loved it! I think the novelty of the pouch is so much fun for him. And I was happy that he was getting organic fruits and veggies for the day. Then my 3yo wanted to try it-also bc of the novelty- and she loved it too! I never thought she would eat "baby food" and spinach at that! But in the pouch, it's a great on the go snack or meal and it's healthy and we are all happy.

review/summary: Innovative, healthy and YUMMY!
review/text: We love these HappyTots! The flavors are wonderful and the added Salba grain is a great way to add nutrients. My son is in Kindergarten and he asks to take these to school for snack time. The pear added to this combo is especially nice since it adds sweetness not found in the veggies - a very nice balance of flavor. Also, the convenience of the pouch is so great, I keep some in my bag, in my car and at the grandparent's house so I know a healthy snack is always available. Highly recommend trying this product and flavor if you are looking to add tasty nutrition to your child's diet.

review/summary: The BEST
review/text: I have a four year old, three year old and 18 month old that love these. When I buy them, I have to get very creative with hiding them or they'll eat them all at once. I didn't know what they were and was very health concious with my slightly chubby and younger daughter. One day while on a walk, we saw these at Target so I bought them each one. Ever since we can't even drive past Target without being asked to stop and get them. We do a lot of traveling and I love these. My oldest is very picky, never ate baby food and was always a "junk foodie". This is the 1 healthy thing that goes down with out a fight. In fact she'll ask for more, then fight her little brother for whatever he still has left in the pouch. We do a lot of traveling and I always pack lots of these, quick, easy and healthy snack on hand.

review/text: My toddler loves this food so much that we have to keep it out of her sight to keep her from refusing whatever other food we're trying to feed her.  I can't for absolutely sure say it's this, but since these squeeze packs were introduced into her diet she will poop more than the usual...Just a friendly warning.<br /><br />These are amazingly handy to take with you when you go out since it gives them a dose of fruits and veggies all without needing a spoon.  My 1 year old has no problem holding the pack on her own and sucking the goo out of the pack.

review/summary: Good food, wrong product!!!
review/text: I ordered this for my 7 month old who LOVES this food. I ordered the 4.22 oz pack of 16, but received 3.5 oz pack of 14. I'm about to return it and ask for the correct product to be sent, but had I not looked closely, I would've just accepted this. Just be careful and make sure you're getting what you ordered. It says it comes from Amazon, but I'm wondering if there's a Happy Baby problem as well...the nutrition facts on the box don't match the nutrition facts on the pouch for the same 3.5oz serving. For example, the box says there's 100% daily value of Vitamin C while the pouch says 27%. I'm wondering if anyone else sees any discrepancies? I would think this would be illegal?

review/text: My 13 month old baby really likes this flavor pouch, in particular.  I have tasted all of the pouches myself and this flavor is one of my favorites, as well.  I never leave home without several pouches.  They have been super helpful when traveling and when out, in general.  My baby now sucks the food out, which makes it even more convenient than using a spoon.

review/summary: Great for Toddlers - this flavor is the most nutritious.
review/text: Our toddler loves this brand. We have tried the other brand of pouches, but she always goes back to these. The flavor and texture is the most favorable to her. We just recently subscribed to this item, because you could not beat the price. Target and our grocery stores have all increased their prices on this line, so they are no longer competitive with Amazon. There is also the bonus convenience factor since our stores were constantly running out of this brand.<br /><br />This flavor is the most nutritious. The pale green pouch comes second, but this combination really has by far the most nutrients than all the other flavors. Toddlers are of course picky and fickle, but our toddler very rarely turns down a "pouch" when all else fails.

review/text: I love these pouches!  From their ease of use for the baby (who just sucks it out of the pouch), to the easy-carry little-mess take-along value, to the interesting combinations of food.  The combos are perhaps odd, but good.  I love that some have the grains too, as that is what is needed to keep baby fuller longer.  I take at least one everywhere we go.  Needed one for the 6 yr old the other day who was hungry while we were out.  She loved it too.

So when he wont eat anything else I as least know he is gettin something good in his tummy when he has one of these.

review/summary: (*Insert noise from happy babbling baby here)
review/text: My 5 month old LOVES these mixtures. I promised I would never feed him something that I wouldn't eat myself. They ALL taste good. I would eat any of them if I was so inclined to eat a pureed meal. They are easy to pack & throw in the diaper back/suit case for travel. I had no worry about them leaking (like a small plastic tupperware). The price is right, shipping was quick, and they store really well in the pantry in the ready made box. Happy Baby = Happy Mommy

review/summary: My four year old loves these!
review/text: I am so thankful to have found these pouches.  My four year old is an OK eater when it comes to fruit/veggies, but these he just sucks down like juice pouches and asks for another!  I love that he is getting some great antioxidants, fiber and omega 3's - especially since is not a fish eater.  We eat these all the time and on the go.  Tastes really good cold too on a hot day!

review/summary: my son LOVES this
review/text: my son has never been a big baby food fan but this particular one he LOVES. he will suck the whole thing down in a matter of minutes. I love that this has chia in it, a huge superfood with lots of omega 3's. I particularly love that because we are vegetarians and it is hard to find vegeterian baby food even when it does only include fruits or vegetables as some companies add gelatin and tuna oil. thank you happy tot!

review/summary: I never thought i'd have to say no to more fruit and veggies!
review/text: My toddler absolutely loves these fruit pouches. We started using them randomly when she was a baby and eating the purees by using the boon spoon which was handy. Then when she was around 18 months i wondered if we could get her to eat more veggies if they were hidden in a fruit puree, after all she eats applesuace like a champion! well much to my delight she devoured these handy portable fruit/veggie pouches as if i had given her candy. She's now 2 1/2 and i have to say that its gotten to the point that I have to regulate how many of these she can have!<br /><br />I keep a box in the car along with an emergency diaper and wipes for those times when you just can't get home fast enough. I really like the bigger size which is more appropriate for my older toddler (and to be honest, i sneak them for myself sometimes).

I have been able to find them for $1 a piece at Taget, but that was a sale.

review/text: I love these and so does my son. I have tasted them and they actually taste good. They are great for on the go and are mess free.  The ingredients are all natural and packed with good stuff which is why I buy them :)  The sugar is little high for my liking but not nearly as bad as some organic baby yogurt. I would love if they would offer a variety pack but my son didn't seem to get sick of the same one since we are just about on our last one out of 16 packets!

review/text: Our 20 month twins love these.  They are very convenient and usually pretty neat!<br /><br />I called the company because our UPC # matched a voluntary recall number from January of 2010 and they were very helpful in explaining the three ways to tell that it was not from that batch (wagon wheel top, "Cheer Pack" on the back, and expiration that would expire no more than 15 months from May of 2010).  Further more, they were confident that the voluntary recall got back all the products with faulty packaging.<br /><br />Very satisfied with this product and the flavor is good!

review/text: You cannot ask for a better product to feed your little one.  It tastes great (just try it), it is clean, and has 100% of Vitamin A for the day.  My little guy eats at least three "nozzle" foods daily and they are so convenient, I can stash them anywhere and not worry about them getting crushed or going bad.  We get the HappyTot ones because of the Salba grains added and the omega-3s in that.  They are wonderful.  Buy many and your baby will be a HappyBaby or HappyTot.

review/summary: great for toddlers, too!
review/text: My toddler (nearly 2 now) has been enjoying Happy Baby's foods since his first Puffs at 7 months of age. While he's not in the baby food stage anymore, I keep these squeezable pouches around for quick snacks and on-the-go eating. I can't really think of a single bad thing to say about these pouches. They're organic. They're all-natural, without any additives, salt, sugar, etc. They're incredibly convenient to throw into my diaper bag to have handy whenever my little guy's looking for a snack, or to add on to a meal that's not as nutritionally-balanced as I'd like. They encourage independent eating - by this age, he slurps them up entirely on his own (once I twist off the cap, of course). They're a great way to get a little extra veggie content into his daily diet, especially on days when he's not in the mood for the vegetables on his plate at mealtimes. The "super grain" blended in makes this one a particularly healthy snack, with a little protein added to the fruit/veggie combination.<br /><br />The butternut squash/apple flavor was an instant hit, sweet and yummy. My little guy reaches for these again and again.<br /><br />The only improvement I can think of? Making the price lower - these are somewhat pricey. Though the Subscribe & Save option helps a bit - thanks, Amazon.

review/text: My 10-month-old loves these, and I do too.  With a little help holding the pouch she can drain one of these pretty quickly through the straw cap so we don't need to worry about bowls and spoons when we are out. Although if you want to use a spoon, the travel spoon tip that boon makes for plum organics fits the cap on these also.  These are a little expensive for everyday, but when we are going out I love that I can just throw a couple of them into the diaper bag.  Then there is the fact that they are organic, healthy, without added sugar, and in BPA-free packaging.  And my daughter really likes the taste.  If I could give them 10 stars I would.

review/summary: Excellent food for a highly independent tyke
review/text: These pouches are wonderful! My son has enjoyed the spinach-mango-pear and butternut-apple flavors since he was 11 months old. They are easy for him to feed himself with, and now that he is 18 months old and wants to do everything by himself, I don't have to worry too much about him making a big mess. They're also excellent for during church or on long trips in the car.<br /><br />The only problem I'm having with this product is that they've become very popular over the last couple of months and I'm having a hard time finding them in local stores lately. So, I suppose this is a good thing for the company, but not so good for when I run out.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to other mothers needing a less-messy, healthy meal/snack for their young ones. And I hope that with the increasing popularity, it will be more widely available in stores.

review/text: My son LOVES the happy baby pouches, so I bought a box of these. I thought the only difference was the size, but these Happy tot pouches have Chia Seed and it REALLY affects the flavor. He used to suck down the happy baby ones, but when I gave him this one, he took a taste and then refused to eat the rest. I tasted it and was put off, too. I bought him another flavor that he ate a little more of, but still not much. I'm really sad I didn't realize the extra ingredient, I wish they would have just left them as fruit and veggie pouches.

review/summary: Great product, can get cheaper at Target - CHECK FOR RECALLED POUCHES!
review/text: We love Happy Tots food. My 12 month old has tried many varieties and loves them all. He has not had one sour face yet! I'm surprised at the price here, you can get this item at Target for $1.09 per pouch which is much less expensive. I guess buying it online is helpful for people who don't have access to a Target or Health food store, and in that case, is worth the price.<br /><br />*** as a special precaution ***<br /><br />A baby food recall just issued by the FDA (Jan. 2010) may have some of the most stomach-churning details I've read in awhile:<br /><br />"Swollen or leaking pouches may indicate problems with the product, including possible contamination by bacteria that can cause illness, or that the packaging has been compromised and is at risk of bacterial contamination."<br /><br />The recalled food is made by Happy Baby, and it's a mix of the baby and toddler lines that parents should be throwing out. The recall covers:<br /><br />* HAPPYTOT Green bean, pear & peas, NET WT. 4.22 OZ. (120g), UPC 8 52697 00127 9;<br />* HAPPYTOT Sweet potato, carrot, apple & cinnamon, NET WT. 4.22 OZ. (120g), UPC 8 52697 00128 6;<br />* HAPPYTOT Spinach, mango & pear, NET WT. 4.22 OZ. (120g), UPC 8 52697 00129 3;<br />* HAPPYTOT Butternut squash & apple, NET WT. 4.22 OZ. (120g), UPC 8 52697 00130 9;<br />* HAPPYTOT Banana, peach, coconut & prunes, NET WT. 4.22 OZ. (120g), UPC 8 52697 00131 6;<br />* HAPPYTOT Banana, peach & mango, NET WT. 4.22 OZ. (120g), UPC 8 52697 00132 3<br />* HAPPYBABY Mango, NET WT. 3.5 OZ. (99g), UPC 8 52697 00134 7<br />* HAPPYBABY Spinach Mango Pear, NET WT. 3.5 OZ.

(99g), UPC 8 52697 00136 1<br /><br />The foods are sold in plastic pouches with plastic caps, and none are set to expire until late this year or even next year, so check through the stuff way back on your shelf. No illnesses have been reported so far, and Happy Baby's CEO Shazi Isram said in a company statement that this is a voluntary precautionary recall.<br /><br />If your pouches are leaking or swollen, the FDA advises you keep them away not just from baby but from your pets as well and wash your hands if you've handled the packages.<br /><br />Happy Baby directs parents to return them to the store for a full refund or contact them at 718-852-7606 or info@happybabyfood.com

review/summary: kids love it
review/text: so my 1.5 year old eats this as a snack and my 3.5 year old daughter always sneaks in a few "sips". i long since stopped using a spoon to feed him out of these packs which is the MOST CONVENIENT thing! my kids just hold it and suck on the tip like a straw. whenever we go on a slew of errands i throw one into the diaper bag (nothing else needed) and feel better about giving him this as opposed to some kind of "empty calorie" cracker with GMOs. HOWEVER, with this product and the other happybaby flavor i purchase (spinach, mango, pears) i don't like how it appears on the front that the veggies are a predominant ingredient. the ingredient list on the back (and the color of the food itself) tells you that there isn't as much vegetable in there as there is pear. for something with green beans AND peas, you would think the color would be closer to a light green rather than just pear. but in the end, if he's getting organic pear with a side of organic veggies and a dose of omega 3s, it's better than goldfish crackers any day!

review/text: So my 3 year old son gulps these down like there's no tomorrow! He loves them. I LOVE them because he's getting spinach a long with a ton of other nutrition. I tried getting him to try some of the other brands' pouches but he didn't go for it. Plus Happy Tot is the only one that contains protein, through a grain called Salba. I googled it to find out more about it...holy moly! Check out the nutrition facts on Salba![...]<br />So I never even tried looking for an alternative after that. Plus I found other amazing uses for it like using it instead of jelly on sandwiches, adding it to cupcakes etc. and...are you ready for this? Happybaby partners with an organization called Project Peanut Butter where they feed a child in Malawi, Africa anytime you buy one of their products. Sweet! LOve this stuff!

review/summary: My 9 month old love this stuff
review/text: I'm a new convert to pre-packaged baby food. I typically make all my son's food but even with glass jars with lids its a little messy to tote my homemade stuff when we are out and about. I saw these at Target one day and decided to try them. I LOVE this stuff now :) I love the fact that it's all natural and the packaging is free of any of the gooky stuff I don't want to put in my kid. When we are out, I don't even take a spoon. My son just sucks it straight out of the package. He is breast fed and occasionally bottle fed and he had no trouble figuring out how to suck these out of the package right away.<br /><br />The flavors I've seen are all mostly fruits with some veggies snuck in. This one tastes mostly like apples (yes, I did taste it :) I taste all my son's food). I would like to see some more flavors that also taste of veggies so they don't get too stuck on the sweet stuff.<br /><br />I also like the fact that if he doesn't finish all of this in one sitting, I can put the cap back on and save it for later. One negative is that on some of the packages I found that the first little bit that comes out is a little nasty looking. The rest of the package looks good and my son has not had a negative reaction. I usually just squeeze that bit out first and let him eat it from there.<br /><br />The price here on amazon is the best I've seen. With subscribe and save I'm averaging $1 or less per package compared to in stores where they average about $1.50 per package.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone, whether you make your own food for your baby or consistently purchase baby food. It's a winner.

review/text: You mean you didn't know about HappyTot Organic Superfoods for Tots?  Well, I can see how that's possible since it has taken *forever* for this company to keep these pouches in stock anywhere!  We ALWAYS have these "fruit squeezies" (as our two-year old calls them) on hand in our pantry and in the diaper bag for a quick, wholesome snack.  They're portable and easy.  We just pop off the cap and he eats straight out of the pouch.  I also love that they've added the supergrain so that the kiddo gets a dose of omega-3s.  If you compare the nutritional information on the back of the product with other organic fruit-pouch brands, you'll see that HappyTot pouches and the other HappyBaby brand pouches actually have nutritional value in them.  Some of the others (I'm looking at you, Revolution Mashups) hardly have any nutritional value at all--not even vitamin C in some flavors.  I gotta say that my son loves all of the HappyTot fruit-veggie combos, though my palate not so much.  Doesn't matter; as long as he likes them and he's getting something more nutritious than the plethora of junk food on grocery store shelves, I'm a HappyMom!

review/summary: Wonderful product! Way overpriced here!
review/text: My daughter LOVES this baby food! She actually reaches out to grab the pouch if I am not feeding it to her fast enough. I wanted to see if I could buy it in bulk. I was shocked at the prices Amazon was selling it for! I went to Target and found them anywhere from $.89-1.49 a pouch. Way cheaper! Sure hope Amazon realizes this and does something about it. This is an amazing baby food. They have a wonderful variety of products and I intend to keep feeding them to my daughter. Love that they're organic, easy to take with you, have fiber (which babies often need when they start solids), and the flavors are delicious (my other two older children and myself tried them).

review/summary: Great Snack Item
review/text: My children (almost 3 & 1-1/2) love squeezable fruit & veggie pouches.  This product is a great way to sneak in veggies for picky eaters and a great way to have variety and meet your daily values when out and about; I also find them to be a great snack. However, it is very difficult to find pouches with veggies at the local stores; mostly fruit pouches are sold, not many organic ones.  So I went to Amazon.  While I was happy to find Happy Tots by Happy baby (one of my favorite brands) the price was not that great.  I later found it for substantially less ($2 less) at a local organic market.  As to taste, while i've tried all other flavors and levels/stages, I will say that there is a particular taste to the Happy Tots because of the addition of a particular grain (Salba).  Give this product a try and see if your kids like it.

review/summary: Good ingredients and taste
review/text: Our daughter is 9 months old and loves this food. She can sometimes eat a whole container at one sitting!<br /><br />In addition to it being organic and having interesting flavor combinations (without getting too bold with the spices, which can turn our daughter off), I like that the food contains salba seed. According to my research, salba is fibrous and absorbs water, so it helps with digestion. If your child tends toward constipation, as ours sometimes does, this can really help move things along without being harsh. I also like the combinations of fruit and veg used in these pouches, which keeps the food from being overly sweet yet makes some of the trickier vegs more appealing.<br /><br />We have tried four different kinds of the Happy Tot pouches and all of them, even the one with peas in it, have passed the test. She actually gets excited when she sees one of us coming with a pouch in our hands!<br /><br />I make it a point to taste everything that I am feeding to our daughter. I think these foods taste good and have no reservations about giving them to her.

review/summary: Nutritious but not tasty
review/text: My 16 months old is practically living on cheerios and Plum Organics pear & mango. I wanted to add something more to his diet. I tried Happytot superfoods because it was so nutritious. But he hated it. I've tried several times and it came right back out with a spit and a cry or frown. I finally tried it, and I didn't find it too tasty either. I don't know what to do with the left pouches. I wish I would've bought a single pouch instead of 16 pouches. I guess I can save them to use them as fertilizer for our garden when spring comes.

She has always been a great eater, but still isn't sure about the texture of some fruits and veggies so these are a great alternative. I am normally short on time since I work full-time and bring her with me most days so we use them alot in the car to and from. They work well anytime we need a snack on-the-go. I'm sure that we will continue to use these for the next few years to come.

review/summary: both kids love it!
review/text: so my 1.5 year old eats this as a snack and my 3.5 year old daughter always sneaks in a few "sips". i long since stopped using a spoon to feed him out of these packs which is the MOST CONVENIENT thing! my kids just hold it and suck on the tip like a straw. whenever we go on a slew of errands i throw one into the diaper bag (nothing else needed) and feel better about giving him this as opposed to some kind of "empty calorie" cracker with GMOs. HOWEVER, with this product and the other happybaby flavor i purchase (green beans, pears, and peas) i don't like how it appears on the front that the veggies are a predominant ingredient. the ingredient list on the back (and the color of the food itself) tells you that there isn't as much vegetable in there as there is pear. for something with spinach you would think the color would be closer to a green rather than just pear/mango. i've made tons of baby food at home and anything with a good amount of spinach (since they place it first and list it first on the FRONT, but the ingredients show otherwise) turns green! i suppose they keep it to a small amount to avoid deterring kids by the color.<br />in the end, if he's getting organic pear with a side of organic veggies and a dose of omega 3s, it's better than goldfish crackers any day!

They are 3 yr old twins and eat big kid meals, but I love the portability of this pouch and it makes a great nutritious snack to take on the go. I especially love that it is Organic.<br />I want to note that I did NOT buy this product on Amazon. I found it at Target for 99 cents each. I thought I could find it on Amazon in bulk for less, but instead it cost almost 3 times more. I'll buy it at Target instead unless that changes.

It's a good way to get extra fruits and vegetables in their diet during the picky eater years.  If you get them through Amazon subscription services, it's a big savings.  I also used them in baking instead of applesauce to replace oil or butter AND add extra nutrients.

review/summary: Great for toddlers! They are yummy, but don't completely mask the veggie flavor
review/text: My son is 16 months and, while he is a balanced and good eater, I still feel he needs more vegetables during the day.  I try to send portions of canned veggies to day care (which, sadly, are his favorite -- I think it's because they're soft and he only has 5 teeth -- I buy the "no salt added ones"), but I don't think they really worry about whether he eats the veggies as long as he eats SOMETHING.  WELL, with these pouches I don't have to worry as much that he isn't getting the nutrients and exposure to the flavor of the veggies.  He will drain these pouches in a second and then keep handing it back to me to so I can squeeze it to get the last drops to come out.  Sadly for him, he can already get the last drop out on his own so I have to tell him it's all gone.<br /><br />And, just in case you're worried they are mostly fruit, you're probably right.  Pear is listed as the first ingredient with peas and green beans listed after.  But, I did taste this one and it tastes exactly like pear sauce and pea puree mixed togehter.  It was pretty sweet, but so are actual peas. I was impressed that the pear flavor didn't completely mask the pea flavor, so he is still developing a taste for vegetables, not just fruit.  Bottom line -- he loves these and it is better than no veggies at all!<br /><br />I give it a 4 only because they are (too) pricey.  I get that they are organic, so maybe they have to be that expensive, and it's expensive packaing, but $1.50 per pouch is a bit much.  You can buy pouches like this from Motts and other companies (in boxes of 4) that are just apple sauce or apple/strawberry sauce for much, much cheaper.  Likewise, Beechnut makes some with sweet potato and pumpkin that are $.99.  The thing is, none of those products include any GREEN veggies, which is why I shell out the $ for these.  I suggest buying in bulk because it will save you a little $ and you're going to want to have one for every day.

review/text: My son is 14 months old now and has hyper sensitive gag reflex, making it difficult for him to eat any foods with texture. Add to it that he's not into fruit -- prefers veggies and more bitter (i.e., plain yogurt) and you have an extremely picky eater. I purchased a box of these hoping that he'd like the taste of the mango enough to mask the other fruits. He'd been getting constipated and I knew he needed more fiber, not to mention vitamin C. Well, he loves these. He loves the taste and he loves that he can feed himself (which is extremely important for a small guy like him with so many developmental delays). The fact that selba has omega-3 is an added bonus for brain health.

review/summary: awesome idea!
review/text: These are so great for on the go. My 1 1/2 old loves them all. She downs them so fast though! I wish they were a bit bigger for that reason. Overpriced for the amount of food, but worth it because the convenience.

review/summary: Love all HappyBaby Tots!
review/text: My kids (18 mo and 3 yrs) love the HappyBaby Tots.  We have tried every flavor and they eat all of them.  I love that they are getting good, organic nutrition, and that the ingredients are wholesome.  I also like the 'super grain', Salba. They are very convenient to throw in your diaper bag or purse on-the-go, or to stick in a lunch box for a snack.  We use a spoon and sometimes a bowl at home for self feeding with my little one, but you can also give the pouch to them to eat directly from the squeeze pouch.  Thank you, HappyBaby, for such great products!!

review/summary: Best Organic Food for Toddlers
review/text: This line of Happy Tots is by far the best product on the market. I have twin girls who are very picky eaters and these are the ONLY ones they will eat.  They can feed themselves (14 months old) and will gladly  eat these whenever presented.  The only problem is, they are hard to find.  I'm hoping Amazon picks them up soon!!!

review/summary: Very convenient
review/text: I have a confession to make: I eat baby food. I'm not a kid, and I'm not even a mother, so I can't make the excuse that I'm testing it to make sure it tastes okay for my baby. I'm a college student with no kids. It's just so easy! And baby food and dog food are so much healthier than adult human food most of the time (no, I don't eat dog food too!).<br /><br />These are the things I like about this particular item. It's super convenient with its little pouch that you can carry with you wherever you go and drink out of. It's mess-free. It's extremely healthy, with fruits, veggies, and chia seeds. It's also fairly low in sugar compared to a similar product I have also tried, the Peter Rabbit Organics pouches (11g compared to 12-23g). Plus it's cheaper.<br /><br />The only things I don't like about this product are the taste and texture, but if your baby doesn't know better, (s)he might not mind. The Peter Rabbit Organics brand has a better taste, although with twice the sugar in some varieties, it's not hard to imagine why. The texture of the chia seeds is also annoying, but I put up with it because a) I already paid for it and b) they have Omega 3s, which are very good for you.<br /><br />With subscribe & save, I paid about a dollar per pouch, which isn't too bad. It's not too filling for an adult, but when paired with a mini Clif bar, it makes a healthy snack for less than the Fillet O Fish I would otherwise get at McDonald's.

review/summary: Tasty Treat
review/text: My son loves these pouches. It is a quick and easy way to get fruits and veggies into a picky eater. He loves the flavor and will grab these from me and eat the entire pouch.<br /><br />I love that it is organic and healthy. The fruits overpower the veggies which helps in making the flavor more acceptable to younger children.<br /><br />It is easy to grab on the way out of the door as a quick snack or as a complement to eating out.<br /><br />I highly recommend!

review/summary: Does the job but not a favorite
review/text: My son eats these for a snack now.  The grain in this makes it a little more textured, so I'm guessing that's why this is not my son's favorite "pouch" flavor, but he still seems to like it okay.  He loves the fruits that are in this one.

review/summary: Great way to sneak in iron for baby!
review/text: I love baby food pouches!  I am a mom of four children, all born with 5.5 years of one another.  I used pouches for the first time with my latest baby, now one year old at the time of this writing.  Anyhow, since the pouches can be somewhat pricey, I opted to buy a box off of Amazon.  I am pleased with the product and the price, which saved money through the Subscribe and Save program Amazon offers.  I especially like HappyTot because its organic, and the different combinations of fruit/veggies has proved to be appealing to my child.  In addition to this, the addition of salba seed offers some fiber and extra nutrition.  I feel good that I can trust the contents of what I am giving my little one.  Once a baby can hold a cup, I would recommend giving them a pouch too.  In time, it has proven helpful, as opposed to spoon feeding.

review/summary: use as meal on the go or flavoring for food
review/text: My 12 month old likes to eat these food packets when we go camping. We also use these to mix into meals like in pasta with veggies. He ends up eating more of his meal when we use these for sauces. I think it adds a little extra flavor and moisture to some meals. I always keep 1-2 of these foods packets in the diaper bag just in case we get stuck somewhere longer than expected-like a trip to the grocery store. They are handy and nutritious on the run, in the woods or in the car.

review/summary: Kid test - Fail...
review/text: I picked this product because it's healthy and sounded yummy. It had lower sugar than most and a good amount of protein. I was hoping my toddler (as a quick smoothie-type snack) and my 7 month old (as a meal) would both enjoy it. I rated it a 3 since my baby seems to be ok with it...but my toddler won't touch it! Good thing they have a long shelf life!

review/summary: Taste not to my child's liking.
review/text: The pear, pea, and green bean flavor is not a winner in our house.  My 13 month old spit out the first taste. I've tried it several times with her, even chilled from the fridge. But she doesn't like it. I tasted it and the pea flavor is prominent.

review/summary: My picky eater (with food allergies) loves this!
review/text: My son loves this product - it is healthy, convenient (packaging) and since he refuses all other greens we've tried, this is a good way to encourage him to eat green veggies.  The one drawback is that the price is on the high side.  I am now wondering if it is worth the value, and will probably try other alternatives if price continues to go up.
