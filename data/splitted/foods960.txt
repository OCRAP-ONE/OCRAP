review/summary: Great product & price
review/text: If your aware of the benefits of hemp oil & are looking for a pure product and great value, I definatly reccomend this hempoil from nutiva.  I prefer hemp oil to the powder, only b/c it's easier for me to squirt some of this in my ricemilk smoothie, or ontop of some veggies, or even in rice or (unbeknownst to my husband) in the caulderon of spicy indian food.  At my local health market this bottle is 25-30 dollars.  Amazon has it at a really good price.  It's the big 24 oz bottle, so your getting a good amount.

review/text: This is a gret product,due to the quality and value. I apply this oil to my hair as a leave in, also use it on my face and body. It makes my hair stronger and extremly smooth,it's lightweight and not greasy at all.I am african american and I can use this oil on my face with no problem of break outs. My skin  is smooth  and silky.<br />For nutrition I make salad dressings,smoothies,or take a 1TB of the oil. You can get recipes on YouTube or health blogs ...<br /><br />The only problem with this product is the packaging.They ship the oil in a small box so It's laying sideways and only 1inflated bubble wrap . Not enough protection ! That is why I didn't give it a higher rating.

review/summary: You'll Love It When You Try It!
review/text: I don't give out many 5 stars but this product gets it. I've been taking it every day since it arrived 10/7/12, 1/3 cup in my Budwig mixture to help me recover from being diagnosed with 2 large brain tumors on 6/15/12 that had reached a critical size and were greatly affecting my ability to communicate and function.  I have chosen to build my immune system exclusively and not put 1 drop of chemo-poison, radiation-poison, or surgery/cutting approach and I am using this product to help me in my healing and recovery.  This oil also tastes fantastic. I eat my delicious Budwig mix with nuts, hemp seed, cinnamon and love the taste and it fills me up all day.  I had heard taking this oil takes away hunger craves and it has for me. It is very green in color which means it has many good anti-oxidants present too. I had been buying and using allot of flax oil but I much prefer this oil and know Nutiva is a very reputable company and Hemp Oil is without question the healthiest oil one can take.  The price of this product is very reasonable and much less expensive than flax oil as well, about 1/2 the cost. I ordered the 1 Gallon container and will be buying more.  The more you read and research Hemp Oil the more likely you'll be to buy and use it. I am well pleased with this vendor as well.  Will update this entry after my next MRI and share results.

review/summary: Hempseed OIl
review/text: Received this item as described. I didn't know this oil had such a short shelf life and required refridgeration. I purchased this oil to use in my hair and body formulations. It is a very light oil and it absorbs into the skin and hair quickly. It has a green color, and a slightly sharp,cut grass like scent. I did taste the oil and it has a distinct, and unique taste also. I only use a small proportion of this oil in my formulations with the exception of my lotions. It lends a good quality to my finished product.

review/summary: Best source of omega 3 and 6
review/text: Besides being the best source of omega 3 and omega 6, it just tastes so good. I'm a vegetarian and had tried flax seed oil, but that tasted so bad i had to stop. So i do eat eggs from time to time so i get some omegas from that source. But when i started looking on the net for another source of omegas i read an article by Dr Andrew Weil [...] that told of hemp oil having the perfect balance of omegas (1 to 3 of omega 3 to omega 6). So i decided to try it. Now i use it on toast instead of anything else. And some on my daily salad. It has a great light nutty flavor. And i just heard that omegas are a blood thinner in case you need that in your life. To sum up, if you are a vegetarian or vegan and want a great source of omegas, get some hemp seed oil. Nutiva brand in the 24oz at amazon seems to be the best price i have found around and i have been eating this for a few years now, and its organic to boot. Grown and processed in Canada which, unlike the silly US, allows hemp to be grown for food, paper and other products. Enjoy and be healthy!

review/text: This item, requiring refrigeration, shipped from Kentucky.  The weather was very warm. It was transferred from USPS to FedEx for transport, then back to USPS for delivery. It was in transit over a week before delivery was attempted in Minneapolis, MN.  After I refused delivery, tracking history showed USPS giving it a tour of the Midwest for the best part of another week.  It finally ended up being put back in Amazon's stock, according to an e-mail I received from Amazon.  I hope that report was inaccurate, because I'm sure the stuff was rancid by then.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAO91K">Nutiva Organic Hempseed Oil, 24-Ounce Bottle</a>

review/summary: Seemed worth a try at first, but, with use, it's really hateful.
review/text: Just got my first bottle. Delivery unproblematic: fulfilled by "Amazon LLC."; seems of good quality; came very fast. Like Barlean's flax oil, it comes in a non-trasparent-black, squeezable, very soft plastic bottle with a valve in the spout. The bottle is sealed under the cap: you gotta unscrew the cap and peel off the seal before you can use it. Press date is in September, which is a bit old, but otoh, hemp oil isn't as perishable as flax oil, so maybe it's OK.<br /><br />Since I've just learned of the purported health benefits of this oil, I can only comment on the taste of it: on the bottle, and here, and elsewhere online, hempseed oil is said to have a really nice, "nutty" flavour. Well, not true: actually, it's more medicinal/grassy, reminiscent of rosemary. Not unpleasant, but nothing special -- actually, flax is marginally better (though I don't particularly like it either). I suspect that were it not for their purported healthfulness, no one would use either of these oils. But supposedly they're good, so we'll see. Unlike flax oil (which has some solids floating in it and needs to be shaken up before use), hemp oil has a homogeneous consistency -- like any other cooking oil, except for the colour: a sort of of luminous green, believe it or not; quite a bit like antifreeze. So these are my initial impressions; I'll update this review if I discover anything noteworthy as I use it.<br /><br />12/28/10: I have to bring the stars down: the taste is horrible; in a matter of days I've grown to hate it -- it's like a greasy medicine of some sort, an emetic. There's _nothing_ it's good with, it SPOILS the taste of anything you add it to. Why do health foods taste so bad? Are they really healthful or it's just hype 'cause the maker wants to sell it? I really can't recommend this product (though it was delivered fine, and in good packaging, so the manufacturing part is fine; just the oil itself is horrible). Flax oil is far less disgusting.<br /><br />01/08/2011: Just poured the remaining half-bottle down the toilet. A solemn moment of personal liberation. Healthful my as.

It's better than making iced tea from regular hot tea, it's better than making iced tea from loose tea, it's just better.  It's so easy (1 tea bag, 2 -3 cups of boiling water, let steep 15 minutes, take out teabag and fill rest of (2 quart) pitcher with cold water).  So far, I've never had a tea bag break, even when I pour boiling water right on the tea bag.  I've been drinking Harney iced tea for years and wouldn't want to do without it.

review/summary: Surprise:  All of Xlear's Xylitol is from China!!!
review/text: I was about to order Xlear's 5-pound bag of Xylitol when I decided to check out where it comes from.  Like many people, I try hard to avoid any food products or ingredients from China.<br /><br />So I called the vendor of this product (the Vitamin Shoppe).  They said I would have to call the manufacturer to find out and gave me Xlear's phone number (801-224-0937).  That number wasn't too helpful because it didn't allow me to reach a live person, but after pursuing several extensions, I reached a live Xlear customer service rep at (877) 599-5327.  She immediately and firmly said that all Xlear Xylitol comes from China.  She added, "Most of the Xylitol you're going to find WILL be from China."<br /><br />As much as I love Xylitol, I'm determined not to buy any from China.  For the past year, I've been buying one-pound bags of "Emerald Forest" xylitol from my local grocery store.  The bags are marked "Made in the USA / U.S.-Grown Birch Trees."  So the news about Xlear's origins came as a surprise to me.<br /><br />However, the 1-pound local bags of Emerald Forest cost $10 each, so I was searching for a better price.  Guess I'll contact Emerald Forest to determine whether their larger sizes of Xylitol (the ones available on Amazon) are still from the U.S.  I'm willing to pay more to avoid consuming any food or supplements from China.<br /><br />And since erythritol is so similar to xylitol, this leaves me wondering where erythritol comes from....Has anyone checked that out?<br /><br />Decided to finish checking things out before posting this review.....So I just located emeraldforestsugar dot com, got the corporate phone number (866-948-1999) and immediately reached a live person.  She double-checked with a manager, then confirmed that even the largest sizes of Emerald Forest Xylitol sold on Amazon are indeed totally produced in the U.S.A. and that all Xylitol labeled "Emerald Forest" is strictly from U.S.-grown trees.  (And by the way, she mentioned that the mfr sells a 55-pound bag of U.S. xylitol, though I haven't had time to check out the price yet.)  This was all good news to me.<br /><br />While I was at it, I asked whether EF's erythritol is also made in the USA, and she said, "Yes, but we're out of it right now--there's currently a shortage."<br /><br />I also asked about their xylitol gum (since I regularly buy Trident w/xylitol) and was somewhat dismayed to learn that EF's xylitol gum is their only product that does contain some Chinese ingredients.  But in about one month they expect to start producing a gum that is totally from U.S. ingredients.<br /><br />I'm giving this Xlear product only 2 stars because although Xylitol itself has worked great for me, I think the origin of this food product should have been clearly listed!

review/summary: Not too good to be true!
review/text: My cousin sent me home with a sample packet of this stuff (I was having problems losing weight and my battle with sugar was severely hindering my goals). I remember thanking her and thinking about her words of "It has no after-taste AND is all-natural", I thought "YEAH, right!" and didn't try it until about 3 months later.<br /><br />I thought, with the name "Xylitol" that it HAD to be a chemical compound, but because she was into all-natural health like me AND she is super tiny, that she must not be lying!<br /><br />Who knew that such a tiny packet could finally change my life. I am finally optimistic in my battle of the buldge because now, there is not only an alternative sweetener to sugar, but that it is absolutely VOID of ANY after-taste AND actually anti-bacterial??!!!<br /><br />I ramble, but seriously, I am chewing the ("Spry") gum that Xlear sent me as a sample after purchasing this 5lb bag of Xlyo-Sweet and what a yummy piece of gum! My mouth feels clean, even after 8 in the morning and having my 'sweetened' cup of coffee, they almost feel like I just hopped out of the dentist chair!<br /><br />Xlear is new to Amazon and they want to widen their customer base, so I am going to go give them a good review, as I received my order SUPER fast AND with sample gum :-)

review/text: So far i am in love! It tastes normal, not like those artifical sweeteners do.  and i don't have that pooky-yucko breath that sugar or honey gives you. also my mouth feels nice & clean.<br /><br />the coolest thing is i noticed my throat is clearing & my congested sinuses are loosening up a lot (i usually have a lot of sinus congestion every day. bad allergies & eating lots of sugar contribute to that) I first noticed i was sneezing a few times, then i noticed that my throat was clearing up. i chewed the gum again & noticed MORE of this effect. It's amazing! so i hopped online & did more research on xyltol & read that it is used as a nasal wash & to clear up ear infections. I believe it after how i feel jsut chewing some xylitol based gum & drinking one cup of tea sweetened with a teaspoon of it i see a HUGE inprovement. I am so delighted!<br /><br />i just used this for the first time tonight so i hesitate to give a 5 star rating as i need to give it more time. I want to make sure it doesn't make me feel funny or that there are no bad side effects.<br /><br />but so far so good!

review/summary: Great for Candida Problems
review/text: The FDA has not studied xylitol.  However I have a lot of problems with oral thrush, fungal based ear infections, stomach distress, etc. This product not only replaces sugar for me, but it cleared up a lot of my symptoms.  There are some european studies that show that xylitol does kill Candida albicans in the mouth but they have a lot more research to do.  I'm not sure if it will work for everyone, but for me it's been a blessing.  Like someone meantioned though, pets cannot have it, it causes severe and rapid hypoglycemia in them.  Also, don't binge on it unless you want to spend the day in the bathroom.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants lower blood sugar, to avoid white sugar, with candida issues, and to have squeaky clean teeth.

review/summary: Mine had a chlorine like smell and more aftertaste than other brands I've tried.
review/text: This brand of xylitol, I bought two bags, STUPID ME, smells like pool water and has more of a taste to it than other brands I have tried.<br /><br />I wonder if residual chemicals from the processing were left in high concentrations!!!!<br /><br />I bought two bags, spent fifty bucks. Now I have to eat it. :(<br /><br />It gives me coffee a weird flavor when the previous brands worked without being detected. I have gone back to using regular sugar, which I am addicted to. I bought this to break free from table sugar and I am afraid to bake with it.<br /><br />I used it in a carrot cake and the flavor was less pronounced in the cake itself, but in the icing, which was a simple glaze with cream cheese added, it tasted very unpleasant. I am a professional pastry chef and I had plans to use xylitol in my foods and help spread the message of xylitol in America. If I can't get solid quality xylitol in large quantities, I don't know how that will happen.<br /><br />I'm going to keep making things with it. Maybe using it in desserts with strong flavors like chocolate will make it less appalling. But I won't dare put it in my coffee again. I'd hate to use splenda, because I don't believe in using chemical sweeteners, but I'd have to buy a separate brand of xylitol for my drinks and this stuff isn't cheap.<br /><br />And yes, I experienced stomach cramps from this brand. I was used to Now Foods brand (I think that's what the brand is called,) and when I switched to this, I got cramps again. I guess they may be different enough to also affect my body differently...<br /><br />I hope this brand is safe!<br /><br />Edited to add: Weeks after this review I contacted the company and they picked up my bags via UPS and sent me two more with very little smell whatsoever. And the taste was greatly improved. They said they would test my old bags but they never told me what they found after testing them. I am just now finishing up my second replacement bag and I am very satisfied with it and their customer service.

review/text: This product is a great substitute for sugar in drinks.  It doesn't have a funny aftertaste or change the taste of the drinks I put it in.  Obviously, it's a good alternative for sugar, but another reason I purchased it was because of it's benefit on teeth.  Xylitol is used in other countries (I've read) to fight tooth decay and improve oral health in adults and children alike (You must used 8-10 grams daily for this benefit).  My husband and I both use the toothpaste (also excellent) and gum.  Last week I saw a dentist on primetime TV doing a show on oral health, and he strongly recommended Xylitol for children also.

review/summary: Great product......however
review/text: Xylosweet was my first purchase of xylitol and I have to say I was very pleased with this product until I found out 1, it is made from corn and 2, it comes from China. I was very disappointed to learn this. I can't complain about the taste at all. To me it taste just as good as sugar without all the calories and has many pluses. It works excellently as a full sugar replacement in baking and cooking and it is excellently priced. However I prefer Xylitol made from birch trees and from the USA so sadly I am going to switch to another brand and hope for the best. For those of you who don't mind xylitol made from corn and produced outside of the US this is a great product.

review/summary: Great Source for Xylitol
review/text: Xylitol isn't cheap, so I was very glad to find this 5lb bag.  The bag has a ziplock top, which works with coaxing.  The bag is also very thick so that if the ziplock didn't work, rolling it up tightly would probably work just as well.  I'm on my second purchase.<br /><br />I use this to help my teeth and sugar cravings.  I put several T. in an air tight container (like small vitamin bottle).  I add several drops of flavoring or oil, like vanilla, orange, lime, etc., and the flavor permeates the xylitol in the container.  then, I just eat little spoonfuls of the flavored xylitol.<br /><br />I've never had gastric problems, not like w other sugar alcohols.  I did accumstom myself slowly to the xylitol, but can now have as much as I want w/o trouble.

review/summary: Buy American, not this Chinese corn cob extract
review/text: There are two mainstream commercial sources of Xylitol - Corn and Hardwood trees such as Birch. Many rumors have circulated on the internet regarding the benefits and or drawbacks of either. Here you can gather the facts.<br /><br />The structure of Xylitol does not differ between corn based and birch based xylitol. However, it is a fact that the vast majority of corn based Xylitol found in North America is imported from China. Almost all imported Chinese Xylitol is derived from corn.<br /><br />Also a fact is that most commercial sources of corn itself are genetically modified. This is not true of birch trees.<br /><br />The process utilized in making birch based Xylitol is envirnmentally green and sustainable, in fact the process often uses caommercial scrap that may otherwise be discarded.<br /><br />So is Birch better than corn? You be the judge, each individual can make up their mind. Prices are almost the same.

review/summary: Prevents Ear Infections, Sore Throat, Cavities--and it tastes good too!
review/text: I started using Xylitol after reading that Scandinavians use it for ear infections  and sore throats, in addition to the Dental benefits we are allowed to hear about in the USA.<br /><br />I guess the doctors have a better lobby than the dentists here.  I think it is disgusting. Children are taking antibiotics for things that could be prevented with some 'sugar'.<br /><br />I have a weak immmune system and get that sore throat/itchy ear thing a lot, I gargle with Xylitol, and it is cured.<br /><br />Also, it leaves your mouth so clean and not sticky.  I now dislike sugar because of the sticky aftertaste.<br /><br />As a sugar addict, I use stevia for sweetening whenever possible, and this medicinally.<br /><br />It clearly states (in teeny letters on the side) to BUILD UP YOUR USAGE GRADUALLY to avoid stomach side effects (diarrhea).  If you suffer from constipation, this can be a benefit.

review/text: I am always on the hunt for alternative sweeteners. I have tried stevia (both extract and liquid) with moderately good results though there is a definite aftertaste. I have tried aguave nectar (I really like it) but am alarmed that this could raise blood sugar. I discovered sugar alcohols through my research and decided to try one or more. I settled on xylitol. Some comments refer to a laxative effect, but I have not experienced any. The Xlear Xylosweet 5-lb bag I tried from Amazon tasted pleasantly sweet with no aftertaste. Once incorporated into baked goods (pies, cakes, and cookies), I could not distinguish between sugar and xylitol. I have not moved beyond the Xlear brand and am now on my second 5-lb bag also from Amazon. Amazon offers a great price and shipping is free.

review/summary: BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS
review/text: I'm happy I can buy a large bag of this on Amazon. It's sold in a much smaller bag in my local speciality store, and is very expensive. I use it for sweetening coffee, put it on frozen strawberries, and leave until they have melted and a lovely syrup has formed. I have had limited success baking with it.<br /><br />It doesn't work very well if you cream butter and sugar together for baking cakes,  I bought the Xlyo cook book but wasn't impressed with it. I found a great cake recipe using Xylo for the "NO SUGAR LEMON DRIZZLE CAKE"  on the BBC Good Food website, it came out great, they have other yummy recipes too. It works well because you don't cream butter into the Xylo.<br /><br />I've used Xylo several times to make ice pops, they come out delicious. I use about four cups of strawberries half a cup of Xylo and a cup of water or cream. Sometimes I mix different fruits with the strawberries. I always have them in the freezer, they make a nice refreshing healthy snack. I use two sets of Groovy ice pop molds. I bought a book on Amazon for making ice pops, but I like my own better.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G32H3Y">Tovolo Groovy Ice Pop Molds, Set of 6, Yellow</a><br /><br />Xylo isn't sugar, so you can't use it for making candy or jam.  The fact that this has some health benifits is great, sugar is bad news. This is good for your ears, has less calories, doesn't damage your teeth, and even diabetics can safely use it. You can buy chewing gum with Xylitol sweetener, which is the same as Xylo. I never used gum until I found this.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018MUNEW">Trident Sugarless Gum with Xylitol, Original Flavor, 12/18 Stick Packs -(216 Sticks Per Box!)</a><br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I've recently discovered that I can make powdered sugar or Xylo in my Vitamix blender. I wouldn't try this in any other blender as I think it may break. I made marzipan with the powdered Xylo a few times and it tasted exactly the same as marzipan made from powdered granulated sugar. Today I made some frosting, that came out good too.<br /><br />WARNING TO THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THE EFFECTS OF TOO MUCH OF THIS PRODUCT.<br />If you have too much to start with, it can give you a terrible stomach ache and make you go to the bathroom. Once your body has slowly become used to it, it doesn't effect you like that any more.

review/summary: Better than sugar and lower cal than honey, not bitter like stevia
review/text: I love xylitol. I love that it is low cal, can be used as a 1-1 substitute for sugar in baking, that its found naturally in our bodies, so its easy to metabolize, and I adore that its good for my family's teeth! My kids love it and don't know they're not getting any sugar and they're concentration levels are high (my 2 year old can concentrate for upwards of 1 hour at a time on some things).<br /><br />I use it when I make bread, cakes, cookies, cereals, ice cream - everything actually.<br /><br />My dad is diabetic and this does a sustained release of energy for him, which is really important when he goes for a walk or at night when he's not eating for a long period and his sugar levels can dip dangerously low.<br /><br />Xylitol is toxic to dogs, so please do not feed any xylitol made goods to your pets. It can kill them.

review/text: I was able to cut sugar completely out of my diet by using Xylosweet. I did not experience a laxative effect at all. As soon as I received it in the mail I made a pitcher of southern sweet tea. I've been using it in my coffee, in my tea, and sprinkled on fruit. I ordered another 10 pounds of it. If you are trying to quit sugar this is the best way to do it. It tastes EXACTLY like sugar and it takes your cravings away. I recommend this 1000%

If I use artificial sweetners I'm poisoning my body.  Plus with xylitol it helps your teeth.  I use it just like I would sugar.  The only thing I haven't tried is baking with it.

review/summary: The best answer I found for a sugar substitute!
review/text: I have Systemic Candida, and at this time, my diet is very restricted and I cannot eat sugar or fruit.  My holistic doctors have warned me off against using products like Splenda, Aspartame, and Sweet & Low.  Most of them recommend Stevia as an alternative, but I found Xylitol and it is as close to sugar as I have found.  I use it in hot tea, in smoothies, on my cereal in the morning, and elsewhere.  I am amazed at how satisfying it is, and I no longer have a need for sugar at all.  It has been replaced!!!  Not to mention it is better for me, has less calories, and is good for my teeth.  The answer to my prayers.  I bought some for my Father who is a diabetic and he loves it too.  I have not had any gastrointestinal reactions to the product at all, but I have read that some people have.  Don't consume too much too quickly.

review/summary: Best so far
review/text: I've been researching natural sweetening alternatives to sugar for a while now and after reading the book Kiss Your Dentist goodbye ( $10 on amazon I believe)  I decided I needed to invest in this for my mouth health as well as my kids'. I was seriously skeptical that it wouldn't have an aftertaste but it truly doesn't. Why would you use an artificial sweetener when you can have one that is natural has no aftertaste and has antibacterial properties? Now I bake muffins for my kids and everything going into them is good for their bodies, and I didn't think there could be a sweetener that is GOOD for you. I mix it with water to clean my 1 year olds teeth instead of sorbitol sweetened tooth and gum cleaners that allow sugar to just sit on your child's teeth. Love,love, love it! And it almost has like a cool clean taste when you first put it in your mouth. There is also gum, mints,  and sprays although I don't know of all the forms this company makes them in.

You're now being driven literally insane by the incessant yap yap yap yap yap yap yap of that infernal little Maltese monster night after night after night and are starting to consider some extralegal solutions. Here's your answer. As little as one gram of this stuff, mixed into some cheap hamburger and thrown over the fence, is enough enough to kill a 10-pound dog, but it's totally harmless to humans. This way, if a small child or mentally impaired adult should happen to come across some of your bait and ingest it, you won't be on the hook for manslaughter.<br /><br />Xylitol: it's God's gift to the victims of nuisance barking.

review/summary: XyloSweet gave me and my two kids diarrhea!
review/text: I was excited to find a natural sugar substitute when I came across Xylitol.  When I got it, my kids and I made lemonade: lemon juice, water and XyloSweet.  About 45 minutes later, halfway through lunch, I noticed my 6 year old daughter stopped eating her lunch, and she didn't look too good. She told me she didn't feel good and so I put her down for a nap. Ten minutes later, my son didn't feel good either.  Long story short: my daughter got diarrhea, and luckily, because she hadn't had that much lemonade, her diarrhea wasnt too severe.  Unfortuneately for my five year old son, who had a lot more lemonade to drink, he first started throwing up, and then also started having the runs--both at the same time!  Poor kid.  About the time I almost had them both settled down, my stomach was churning, and next thing you know I had to rush to the bathroom, for the first of what would end up being nine trips.<br />In between bathroom trips, I Googled: "Xylitol reactions" and was surprised at the number of listings that popped up.  I found that supposedly about 20% of people that try xylitol will have a reaction.  I think that figure is on the low side because my two kids are adopted from totally different sets of parents.  So when you consider that the three of us have different genetics, and yet we all had a problem with this stuff, I'd say that probably more than 20% of people that try this, will have a reaction.<br />BUYER BEWARE!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ORSIJ4">Xlear - Xylosweet 5lb, 5 lb, 1 bag</a>

review/summary: Sanguinary awfulness
review/text: Having read many books on this subject, the epilogue of Napoleonic Wars, Mr. Summerville's book seemed to pick up on some loose strands not explored by Lincke in "Napoleon's Generals" and to be an index to more recent compilations, such as Atkins' encyclopaedic work on Waterloo or Barbero's "The Battle", a very recent and definitive written work.  Outside of his comments on General Adams, there is nothing here you cannot obtain either through well written books, which his is definitely not, or on the internet through the Napoleonic series for free.  The temptation to buy this on the off chance that he would say something about the absent General Alix de Vaux, apparently a former commander in Westphalia for Jerome Bonaparte previously.  Hoefschroer gave more details about Alix being at a depot outside of Paris when the Prussians marched against the city after the Waterloo battle, but it would have been nice to have had a greater biography.  The thumbnail sketch of Foy was abysmal and even his English subjects are hurried or trivialized by Summerville's lack of discipline where writing history is concerned.  Find a copy of Dix's French language history of Napoleonic generals in the library or dig through Phipp's History of the Revolutionary war if you want details, buy Haywthornethwait as he is very knowledgeable and readable, but if you crave a highly priced rag of anecdotes you already know, this can fill your S-surnamed author's niche as well as the next.  Better off again with Segur's tome to be certain.

Barley water<br />is very good to prevent UTI and helps with acid refulx.  Try drinking this water to lower th PH of your stomach - leave out the lemon juice others add. See how to make on utube.<br />I soak it overnight and boil 15 mins and strain and put the barley aside and keep the barley water and store it in a pitcher in the refrigerator.  I make 4 to 5 quarts at a time.  I explored this product after listening to OZ some time ago.  This is a cheap health food and can save many people a lot of cost and pain from a acid reflux.

Because some people on this site like to rant and rave about a product technically having MSG. For the record and I have six different flavors of this product, there is no mention of this product being MSG free on any of the packaging. Okay? So, stop giving bad reviews to this product because you claim they advertise as MSG free. They do not do that, and you are spreading lies. You know who you are! Stop giving this product bad reviews for made up reasons. Read the label!

review/summary: I can't live without this line of products!!!
review/text: I use Better than Bouillon bases as flavor enhancements in everything I cook that has a liquid in it.  I'll never make rice with just plain water again!  Poach your eggs in broth made from it!  Anywhere broth is called for I add a shot of this wonderful stuff.  I have every flavor in my kitchen cabinet.  I buy the giant jars when I find them.  Start with small quantities and cut down on the salt you add separately as this is quite salty, especially the mushroom base.  I drink it when sick.  It is my manna.

review/summary: ridiculous pricing scheme
review/text: 1 cent for the root beer, and $47 for shipping.  Why does Amazon even let this on here?  It simply takes up space when I search for root beer.

review/summary: Best price I could find
review/text: I live in a very rural area and I cannot buy red lentils at local grocery stores. It's nice that I don't have to think too much about where to find them, since they're readily available online. I'm very satisfied with my purchase from this seller and will use them again when I need to.

review/summary: Great tea but tea bags may be good enough...
review/text: PG Tips is a great tea from England, strong a full of flavour.  One can easily find tea bags in some up-scale supermarkets but those of us who like to use loose tea have trouble finding this product.  Upon opening the box, I was surprised to find how fine the loose tea is ground.  It is probably the same product that goes into the tea bags which, I guess, shouldn't have surprised me.  Not all infusers will work well this this product, a fine mesh size is necessary if one is to avoid a lot of leaf fragments in their drink.  I can usually get two decent mug-fulls from two teaspoons of loose tea, making a second cup with the PG Tips did not produce as nearly as robust drink as the first steeping.  I put this down to the fineness of the tea leaves and there being not much left in them for a second cup.  To be honest, a second steeping of PG Tip produced a drink comparable to the standard Lipton tea first steep but when one is expecting the robust flavour of PG Tips, it proves somewhat unsatisfying.  Will I buy the loose leaf version of this tea again?  I'm not sure at this point.  Tea bags are convenient and there is no shipping charge for me to get them but I do like loose leaf tea.  We shall see.

review/summary: Ideal tea drink
review/text: I use this tea in my K-cup filter. Just 2 teaspoons of PG Tips loose leaf tea in the permanent filter makes a a rich 8 oz. cup of tea. By using the loose tea leafs I realize less mess and bother than tea bags. I think the flavor is even richer than the tea bags.

review/summary: GF, Dairy Free, Corn Free & Alkaline Forming
review/text: This product (original flavor) does not have a sweet taste. I  enjoy the green - nutty taste.  I like this product because it is GF, dairy free, and especially corn free. The company told me this is corn free.  Because the bar is not heavy in protein, I do not get a sleepy feeling after eating this product.  Everyone's body is different, but this product does not make me feel sluggish.  Also, Amazon's pricing makes eating healthy affordable.  Thank you Amazon!<br /><br />Update July 2011.  Amazon must have changed the vendor.  The price now is more expensive and does not offer you a subscriber discount.

review/summary: Healthy Bars Without the Extra Flavors
review/text: I brought these at a local health food store since they were the only ones that weren't peanut butter or chocolate flavored, or didn't have several lines of "extra" ingredients in them. These are on the savory side of the flavor spectrum, if you like the sweeter granola/energy/fiber bars, these will be on the bland side. The best way to describe the taste is that they taste like they look - green. I found these were much more filling that traditional granola bars with less calories, fat, and additives. However, they are on the pricey side. I keep these handy in my car and purse to prevent hungry trips to fast food restaurants when time is short.

review/summary: Excellent Energy Bar
review/text: I purchased these energy bars because I like the Amazing Green Energy drink made by the same company.  The bars taste very good and give me a good "raw" energy during my 40 mile bike rides.  I would recommend them to anyone that is interested in a not too sweet, raw, energy boots during physical activities, or just for a quick snack between meals to keep your hunger at bay.<br />Liz L<br />Wilmington NC

review/summary: Not what I was expecting
review/text: I have never eaten the nutrition bars (no matter what brand) and wanted to give them a try.  I use the Amazing Grass dried wheatgrass powder in my smoothies in the morning and decided to try the bars.  They have a very dense texture, and I needed a lot of water in order to eat a fourth or half of a bar.  I purchased the 12-count package and ended up giving away most of the bars.  I just found them to be too difficult to eat.

review/summary: Great RAW food energy bar
review/text: Most of the "Energy" bars found in supermarkets are so full of refined sugars and processed ingredients that they're hard to digest and actually slow you down. These are full of raw, high-net-gain ingredients, so the body can digest them easily and get that energy you need and/or really curb hunger between meals. I buy them via Amazon because I get a better price than at most health food stores and because they're somewhat hard to find. I definitely recommend them and try to keep some around for quick snacks on the go.
