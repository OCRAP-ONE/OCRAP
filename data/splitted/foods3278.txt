review/text: Finally opened the package, and use these for the 200pm mid day work slump to remove junk food cravings. These bars satisfy immensely; don't feel hungry, tired or irritable and they look and taste fresh.  They are chewy, providing texture and mouth satiety.  Will definitely order again.  Purchasing by the case is cheaper than other stores.

review/text: Although this was described as being a Mackintosh product it turned out to be Nestle. Could be that my taste buds have changed since leaving England but it didn't taste as good as I remembered, seemed more like the product that is available here in the States. My disappointment could just be my recollection that is why I am giving a three star. I received the product in great condition and it was shipped very promptly from England so I do not fault the seller.

review/summary: Nestle Quality Street Candies, actual Tin size
review/text: I love Quality Streets and was delighted to see them on here, but I feel I was mislead with the description and picture. I was expecting the normal size (larger) tin for this $27.75, but instead I got a less than half size tin. The picture is misleading with no scale reference. I've seen this often on here especially around Brit foods, they find the smallest package picture them as the norm that we are familiar with and flog them at the large package price. Elsewhere on the net I could have bought the large tin for less than they charged for this small tin had I known what to expect.

review/summary: Nice Aroma and Fine Taste.
review/text: I only drink whole-bean, grind-it-youself coffees. Sorry, I just couldn't go back to those other hot dark liquids that other people call coffee. No, once you get used to grinding your own you're hooked. The question might be, where do you get good whole bean coffees at a reasonable price? Grocery store prices for one-pound bags tend to be high. Likewise, specialty shops can be very high. I've found two good sources: Trader Joe's and Costco, plus a wide variety can be found online. For the past few years I have switched almost entirely over to my local Costco. A problem with Costco is that they may have only two different kinds, but the kinds may change every other time you go there.You just don't have much choice unless you work at it a bit. However, every bag I've bought has been excellent. Well, it better be because you can only buy it in three pound bags.<br /><br />My latest acquisition is a three-pound bag of Jose's 100% Columbia Supremo. Mmmmmm. Nice aroma! It's a medium roast, soft and mellow. No harsh aftertaste. It reminds me of Trader Joe's Columbia Supremo, and I understand that is just the government's grade for Columbia's finest. In any case, it's a nice coffee and I'll have no trouble getting through it. I might add, that I like to switch types from bag to bag and I've now tried coffees from all major growing areas of the world.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Very very delicious cereal
review/text: Nature's Path Maple Pecan Crunch is by far the tastiest cereal I've had in a very long time. You can feel good about supporting this company because they are committed to sustainable farming and Earth-friendlier business practices (according to the marketing on the box anyway). Even if you didn't care about that, you'll like the cereal. I'm eating it right now straight out of the box as I write this review. It's very hard to stop! The flax flakes and rolled oat clusters are very crunchy and satisfying. I can also clearly taste the maple syrup flavor.<br /><br />One box is 6 servings, with each serving providing 220 calories (60 from fat) and 20% of your daily dietary fiber intake (5g). If I had any complaints, it's that the box is a bit small. It is only 11.5 ounces compared to 13 or 14 for other Nature's Path cereal which contain 7 servings. Secondly, the sugar content could perhaps be toned down a bit to trim back some calories because it's very sweet. One serving is counted as 3/4 cup, compared to 1 cup for many other cereals. Because of the pecans, it packs more energy (calories) into a smaller volume than, say, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001V74HAU">Kellogg's Raisin Bran Cereal</a>, which counts 1 cup as a serving, with 190 calories (15 from fat).<br /><br />At any rate, it's a very delicious cereal and one I'll be buying it again!

review/text: I bought a 6 pack case of this when it first came out and liked it so much I set up a subscription.  Half way through my second order I finally asked my wife if the cereal seemed to have less pecans and less bunches.  When I asked she told me she was wondering the same thing.  Well I just received my third case and I have no need to ask anyone.  My first bowl had almost no pecans in it and no crunchy clusters.  Just to be sure this wasn't a fluke of a bowl I pulled the cereal from the box and found myself staring at what looked like a plain bran flake cereal.  I really had to look hard to see anything other than bran flakes.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed with what started off as a very good cereal. My subscription has been cancelled.

Actually in the past I'd only eat cereal maybe 1 or 2 times a week, but the Maple Pecan Crunch has changed that.  You can both taste and smell that it's genuine maple syrup.  The cereal is just the right amount of sweet - not overly sweetened.  Nice crunch.  It would be even better if it had more pecans, but that's easily added.

The flakes also hardly get the really soggy feel like when you leave corn flakes in milk for too long.<br /><br />As a plus, the company is committed to sustainability and healthy products.

review/text: Because its called Flax Plus Maple, I shouldn't have been surprised that it was maple flavored, but they went a bit too heavy handed with the maple.  Its overwhelming.  However, if cut with 75% of another cereal, such as muesli or granola, you get just the right amount of maple.  However, if you love to flood your pancakes with more syrup than pancakes, this would be perfect right out of the box.

review/summary: Light and Healthy
review/text: I bought a six pack of this cereal when I saw it on sale because I eat a lot of cereal and therefore get sick of the various brands and makes pretty quickly. I had never tried this but had seen it in the store (usually for double the price of Amazon)so I thought I would give it a try.<br />I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. If you like maple flavor, you will probably enjoy this. It has pecan chunks, which aren't super healthy but do taste good. It also has oatmeal clusters that are somehow very light and add nicely to the flavor of the flakes which taste good as well. There is a decent amount of flax seed in the mix as well, which I am trying to eat more of. Overall it is sweet enough that my 4-year-old enjoys it but probably healthier than most of the sugar cereals out there. I bought three more six packs a week later and have yet to get sick of it. I will probably order this again.

No, they don't make me as happy as Cookie Crisps or Frosted Flakes, but they are pretty good for a health food and something I have been able to incorporate in to my diet. Yes, them I am eating them I sometimes wonder if I would still get the health benefit is a rolled them in melted butter and melted marshmallows making little "flax crispy treats", but there isn't a more tasty way to get this much fiber in your breakfast - so feel good trying them even if you aren't a "health nut". I am pretty sure I wouldn't be getting flax in my diet any other way!

review/summary: Bargain in bulk
review/text: Make note of the ozs / box, as it's not your typical junk cereal. Organic and nutritious ingredients keep you full with less, and you don't crash mid-morning. @ $7.98 for 6 (it's $5/box elsewhere), we couldn't pass it up. The taste takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to garbage, but the subtle sweetness really grows on you.

review/summary: NOT gluten free!!
review/text: The one star rating is really for the way this product is listed, not the actual cereal.  This cereal is listed under gluten free cereals in Amazon, and it is not gluten free. Wheat is the first ingredient. The name is very similar to Nature's Path Organic Crunchy Maple Sunrise, which I thought I was buying, not realizing there were two cereals with similar names made by the same company. Now I have 6 boxes of unusable cereal in my house. Things I learned: don't take Amazon's search results at face value; read every ingredient on the label of everything I buy, even if I think it's safe.

review/summary: Taste Great!
review/text: There is not much more to say.  There's a nice balance; not too much sugar, but enough to enjoy.  The flavor is surprising, in that usually something that carries this many healthy items generally will need to be forced down.  I only got to the bottom of the fourth box, as my seventeen year old seems to enjoy it as well.  That being said, I'm not sure if there were not enough nuts/pecans, or that they all fell into his bowls.  I hope the price doesn't go up.  There was one other cereal we kept religiously with maple and pecans from a health food store, but the price shot up to four and five dollars, plus, so we stopped buying that one.  Thanks Nature's Path.

I have had 2 packages of 6 boxes now, and I will say that it is extremely good.<br /><br />I will occasionally open a box that is less flavorful than what I believe is typical for this brand, but still decent.  I have refrained from docking the item a star for that because I understand that this could be for any number of reasons, and it's an uncommon occurrence.<br /><br />It's full of pecan chunks, and has a delicious and strong, but not overpowering, maple flavor.

review/summary: Yum
review/text: I'm the type of person who has coffee in the morning and heads out. Not anymore. Nowadays I sit down and eat breakfast. This cereal is that good. No artificial flavors or preservatives. Whole grains, maple syrup, pecans...yum. Got a pack of 6 and it was gone in two weeks. Don't hesitate to buy for children, the kids I babysit couldn't get enough of it. Their mom now buys it.<br /><br />I like that I can read/recognize all of the ingredients:<br /><br />Organic whole wheat meal, organic rolled oats, organic evaporated cane juice, organic wheat bran, organic pecans, organic flax, organic soy oil, organic brown rice flour, organic oat bran, organic barley malt extract, sea salt, organic maple syrup, organic coconut, natural maple flavor, organic oat syrup solids, organic molasses, organic cinnamon.<br /><br />Each serving has 220 calories and 5g of daily fiber (which is 20 percent of your total). I've been trying to find a cereal with a lot of fiber that tastes good. I find most don't taste very good. According to WebMD, most Americans only get 14g of fiber. I usually have two servings of this cereal for breakfast, so I'm halfway to my allotment of daily fiber.<br /><br />My nutritionist at Carolina advised me a diet high in whole grains and fiber leads to less weight over the years. Maybe this cereal doesn't help you lose weight, but it certainly doesn't put it on. These aren't empty calories, this cereal is filling and nutritious.

review/text: This is a delicious cereal, but equally as important, it's very filling. I tried the Special K thing for a while and was finding myself hungry about two hours later, which lead to snacking. I was a little hesitant to try this, since I find their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036R7HGE">Maple Pecan Granola Bars</a> to be too sweet for my taste, but the cereal is spot-on. The flakes balance out the maple crunchy bits very well.<br /><br />That all being said, I still think I prefer their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5RFE">Organic Flax Plus Pumpkin Granola Cereal</a> over the Maple Pecan Crunch, but this is a very good change of pace.

When I checked the expiry date on the package, it indicated the product was set to expire within 5 months. The cereal had gone rancid and I don't know if it was because of the hot summer weather the case was presumably subjected to during shipping. We had to throw all the cases away and could not return the product because it is not eligible for returns.

review/summary: Arm & Hammer Super Scoop
review/text: This product is amazing to me.  I've tried many different brands...and I mean many.  The various cat litters I've tried always seemed to have one drawback, it's too dusty, can't stand the sweet nauseating scents (neither can my cats), and does not cover up soiled cat litter, just makes it worse from the combination.  I have had some difficulty trying to get my cats to use the other brands, but they did not like them and sometimes left me little messes to remind me.  Since I've purchased Arm & Hammer Super Scoop (and I will never buy another brand), everything is peaceful in my home and I've noticed the absence of "little messes".<br />  This cat litter has very little dust, if any, is unscented, clumps nicely, and best of all, my cats like it.  Additionally, the perfume some brands use are toxic to cats, because when they groom themselves, they will ingest the chemicals from the perfume. I've had friends over with a very strong sense of smell, and they agreed that they could not smell urine or stool, and this was several days after I cleaned the cat pan.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who loves their cats and kittens.

review/text: As others have noted, the clumps don't really stick together all that well. Plus, the litter itself doesn't seem to do anything about ammonia smell from cat pee, so it'll about knock you over when you go to scoop the box (unless maybe you scoop it every time the cat uses it, or something). I expected better from Arm & Hammer. If you're considering buying this, just don't. Get Fresh Step instead; Fresh Step's unscented litter actually controls litterbox odors, unlike this stuff.

I felt very confident in going with Arm & Hammer because of the 5 star ratings and reviews, but YUK!  We've got 3 cats and this litter did not eliminate the smell from our laundry room at all, which I'm sure is due to the fact that the urine did not clump.  The litter box really was never clean unless I changed the litter entirely.  I do not recommend this product, and I'm thrilled to report that Tidy Cat is now a part of the Subscribe and Save program!

I also wanted to avoid scented litter as i had read reviews about Cat's smelling like the scent after using it. My apartment is pretty small and even in the kitchen, there is never a smell or issue with this litter after my cat uses it. I am so happy i discovered this one on my first buy and I will definitely be sticking to it.

review/summary: Better than the scented kind!
review/text: I was previously using the scented Super Scoop and only purchased this because it came in a large box through Prime.  I was concerned it would be stinkier, and was shocked to find out it actually absorbs odor BETTER than the other version.  With the scented kind, I daily used Arm & Hammer deodorizer, which temporarily worked.  However, it caused powdery issues and lessened the clumping power.<br />  With the UNSCENTED kind, I hardly ever use the deodorizer and am MUCH more pleased with the results.  Clumps great, no icky perfumy (or stinky) odors, and much less powder in the air (which REALLY grosses me out).  Best kitty litter I've ever tried, and I've been around cats my whole life.  Highly reccomend.

I am looking for something that clumps together well which makes cleaning the litter tray a lot easier, but I am tired of my cat always smelling like her over scented litter box. This is a litter without a scent so I now have a normal smelling cat. The litter clumps easily around her businesses and I have had no major issues with odors. All my litter boxes have hoods due to the amount of little my cat would throw all over the floor. This a 40 pound box and so it easily lasts for a while and the fact that I can subscribe and save means that now I don't have to remember when I have run out to go to the store to get it and also I no longer have to carry it home it arrives at my door for free. Now if only it would clean the litter box for me!<br /><br />Update: October 10th 2012, Over the last couple of months something has changed in this litter. It no longer clumps together as well as it used to and breaks apart, meaning that used litter remains in the train. I have swapped out the litter several times in the last month or two thinking that it would solve the problem but have decided that they have changed the litter. Even after I have done the litter tray there is still an odor. I will not be ordering this product anymore. I will have to try others. Hopefully they will banish those litter tray odors. If I could I would give this product 0 stars.

review/summary: So far so good...
review/text: Litter...I have a love and hate relationship with it. But the cat has to love it.<br /><br />After being a "World's Best" customer for 10 years, we got a new kitten and our location demanded we get the Arm&Hammer from our Pet Store - but Papa Cat got the stinky stuff - the stuff that makes the cat smell like a rotten flower shop - and every time I scooped it I would gag. Not good. But she loved the litter, and I loved that it didn't track "dust" like World's Best - so I searched, read all the reviews, and decided to try this one.<br /><br />No, not leaving five stars yet. We'll see how it holds up after a few months of using it.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I have been an olive oil snob ever since I tried this oil in a health food type store, years ago.  I have only been able to find it at that store. Our Company has since moved and we are no longer near the store so I cannot locate a lot of the wonderful products I used to take for granted being in Brooklyn NY.  This is like liquid gold.  I could drink it, its fruity and light and very tasty.  Add lime and a touch of sea salt and put an any and everything!!!.  Years ago I paid $12.99 a bottle, so I guess this price is OK. I also prefer Colavita's Il Numerato, which is also impossible to find.

review/summary: six years with the tea
review/text: I was a librarian for 19 years and a reference librarian for 3 of those.  I am a skeptic when it comes to cure-alls, but after doing months of research and hunting down the original pamphlet with all the information about Camas Prairie Tea, I am a believer.  My doctor keeps saying..."Girl, you are 70 years old...what is your secret?"  I keep telling him about Essiac Tea, but as is usual with medical folks, they raise their eyebrows...except now I find that one of the ingredients in the tea, Slippery Elm Bark, is frequently used in chemo treatments.<br />All my blood work, blood pressure, heart rate...all of it...it right on the money or lower.  I do have to say that I have a natural genetic structure that is fortunate, but my energy level and health goes beyond that.  So I keep taking it, every day, two ounces...and feel great!  LF

review/summary: Camas Prairie Essiac Tea
review/text: I have family and friends that have been drinking this tea to help their immune system treat cancer. They are doing well so my husband and I decided to start drinking it as a preventative measure. We ended up with a benefit we hadn't expected. My husband has dealt with morning nausea since he was a kid. Two days after we started drinking Essiac Tea his morning nausea went away. When we ran out it came back. So we will continue drinking it every morning.

review/text: I love this cookie mix because the dough holds together perfectly, even through multiple rolling-outs. When the dough gets a little room- temperature the cut cookies still hold shape! Baked, they are a soft cookie yet sturdy enough for lots of decoration. They taste a little less sweet than a regular sugar cookie but I prefer that since the icing is nearly pure sugar.<br /><br />One word of warning: I ordered a case of 6 from Amazon in July and the "best by" date is September.

After speaking with her a few days ago, she confirmed that the pretzels are very good and has gone through one of the bags faster than intended. However, I can't give the item a great review as the tin that the pretzels came in had a large dent in it. Apparently it wasn't enough to damage the contents, but it was something that happened prior to shipment as there was no damage whatsoever to the box that the tin came in. Just something to be aware of, especially if you intend this item to be a gift.

review/summary: for greek recipes
review/text: I am purchasing this cream/paste/spread for a while now (via subscription), and it is pretty versatile in use. Basically any greek recipes can go with it (or the other way around, I guess).<br /><br />I has a slightly smoked aroma, but very subtle, and it is completely vegetarian. I add it to crusty breads (homebaked only), fried potatoe cubes (also add onions, garlic, peppers, bacos etc) and even pasta salads. Add it as a side dish to any greek recipes.<br /><br />It comes packaged in small RE-USABLE glass containers which are neat to re-use as fridge containers later (after use of this spread/cream/paste). You know, where you can put away any leftovers of any food items later.<br /><br />Anyone cooking european dishes at home should have this in the pantry. It is shelfstable for years.<br /><br />Those who just re-heat processed foods from boxes (and then say "I cooked"!!) will not want this, but I guess those would not search here anyway.

review/summary: Crunchy and ~delicious~!
review/text: What is wrong with me?  I ~love~ Product 19!  Not because it is healthy (for cold cereal), but because it tastes great and keeps its crunch.  How can Special K, which turns to mush on contact with milk, be so much more popular?  How can it be that even some "fans" in these reviews take shots at the taste of Product 19?  My love for this cereal may be slightly eccentric, but I do not rave about it from the perspective of especially favoring aggressively "natural" foods that are full of bran or whatever.  True, I hate Wonder Bread and other foods that have been processed beyond all recognition.  But I definitely do not favor twigs and berries.  It seems to me that half the world is willing to give up brownies in favor of granola bars (I definitely am not), and yet people bash this great-tasting cereal as though it were cod liver oil.  But I cry out to you from the wilderness!  Give this stuff a try!  It's delicious.<br /><br />8/22/09 - Gosh...we seem almost like a cult, we fans of P19.  I remember when it was introduced and believe its low sales were caused by marketing ineptness.  It was perceived by the public to be a health food, similar to Special K, which was already well established.  Kellogg's never did get around to promoting it for its great, hearty flavor and ability to stay crisp in milk.

review/text: Product 19 has been a favorite since 1967. It is almost impossible to find in grocery stores so the subscription service from Amazon is a "lifesaver".  Kellogg marketing is really missing out by not being more agressive in store placement. Product 19 made a very brief appearance in my local WalMart Super Center but quickly vanished. The cereal stays firm (vs a quick soggy mess) and has excellent taste. Just all round GOOD!

review/text: Product 19 is a great cereal, but it's really hard to find.  I even checked Kellogg's website and found they don't sell it within 35 miles of my city - and I live in a pretty major city.  After years of browsing the cereal aisle, my husband found this online and ordered the first set for me.  I'm really picky about cereal.  I don't like the real sugary cereals or the "full of fiber" cereals.  This is a great cereal for someone that wants a good basic cereal.  It tastes great and is healthy.  My co-workers think it's funny that I ordered my cereal off of Amazon, but it's really good, I've been looking for it for a long time, and  now that's one less thing I have to go to the grocery store for.  Plus if your order is over $25, you get free shipping.

review/text: It was 1971 when I started my day with a bowl of Product 19 and half a grapefruit.  Yet, the daily anticipation of the flavor, crunch and satisfaction of obtaining so many RDA's has never wavered.  Only Total cereal approaches Product 19's vitamin content but with a flavor I consider minimally palatable at best.<br />When the last store in my area stopped carrying Product 19, I was driven to call Kellogg's who provided no consolation.  Then, I found Amazon.com promoting their grocery line.... Amazon is a life-saver!..<br />I recommend any reader of this review that has Product 19 in their market to try this product.  Read the box text, become a believer and enjoy!

review/summary: A very healthy breakfast cereal with just a few minor drawbacks...
review/text: Product 19 is an excellent breakfast cereal. It has absolutely no fat, no trans fat, no cholesterol, and it is rather low in sugar content. Excellent! Product 19 even has 100% of vitamins C, E, B12, B16, iron and other nutrients as well. Very impressive! (Amazon states that it has only 10% of these nutrients but that is incorrect.)<br /><br />On the other hand, the cereal is low in fiber and it contains sodium and carbohydrates. Check the label to see if you're comfortable with the amounts of ALL the ingredients in this cereal before buying it. Product 19 is something that grew on me; I initially didn't like it but I kept eating it in the morning for health reasons. Over time I appreciated the taste more and more. This may be true for you, too. Not everyone will find this cereal to be tasty the very first time they eat it. You could add a few strawberries or blueberries on top of the cereal to make it sweeter; these berries are also very healthy for you, too.<br /><br />The packaging is attractive. The sealed plastic bag inside the box keeps the cereal fresh even a couple of months beyond the expiration date on the box.<br /><br />Overall, Product 19 is an excellent cereal for people who care about what they eat. It may take a little getting used to because of the taste and the consistency of the cereal flakes. Despite the "taste factor" and a few drawbacks concerning sodium and carbohydrates, I highly recommend this cereal as part of a healthy diet.

review/summary: Best Cereal Ever!
review/text: Has anyone noticed (particulaly Kellogg) how many 5 star reviews Product 19 has? My husband and I love this cereal.  I agree with all of the positive reviews I've read so far. When our local grocers stopped carrying this product I was devastated! I looked everywhere and then finally found it on Amazon. What a relief! I thought the product had been discontinued so my first order was for 4 (yes that amounts to 4 times 4 or 16 boxes!) I know that sounds nuts but we gave some to my son and a few to a foodbank. Like I said, I thought it was being discontinued. It all went and now I'm relieved to see that I can still order it.  This is the only cereal that I will eat.  Like someone said, other brands like Total and Special K become soggy the second that you pour milk on them (not to mention they're not as tasty as P19!).  P19 remains crunchy for quite some time and is really good tasting - not to mention nutritional! Kellogg's are you listening?  You have really missed the boat on this by pulling it off the shelves from so many loyal customers! This is only the second review I've ever written, so I really feel strongly about this! I would love to see it return to my grocers! (in the meantime, thanks Amazon for carrying it!) Anyone else?

Purchasing from Amazon has turned out to be a convenient way to stock our pantry.  Price is less than our grocer charges by ~10%, plus free shipping, makes this really convenient.

review/summary: Hard to Find Favorite
review/text: Whenever I grocery shop (in a hands-on grocery store) either Product 19 isn't a featured cereal or it's $4.25. Hmph! At least with the "Subscribe and Save" option offered by Amazon, I can always count on: great price (w/o tax), free shipping, and 4 boxes a month. You just can't beat it!

review/summary: My favortie breakfast cereal.
review/text: I love Product 19 and when it was getting harder and harder to find it on my grocers shelf I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.com.  The cereal is the same size and quality as the one I would buy at the grocers.<br /><br />There is a standing order with the seller who does a a great job of emailing me with a heads up for the next delivery.

review/summary: Great cereal bad price?
review/text: Product 19 is one of my favorite cereals.  The flakes are very crunchy, full of vitamins and make an excellent snack.  The 4 grains plus the malt do the trick.<br /><br />Because of the taste it is an easy way to get the kids to eat something good for them.  However the only drawback frankly is the price.  Here in Massachusetts we can get single boxes for less that the price per box quoted here, however I'm assuming that price can fluctuate from state to state so this objection might not apply to you.<br /><br />Bottom line this is good product, just make sure the volume discount is worth the price.
