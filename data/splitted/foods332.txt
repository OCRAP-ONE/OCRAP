review/summary: Easy to prepare and delicious
review/text: This Six Pack of prepared spices for making chicken curry is another in the recent increase in products making ethnic cuisine easier to make.  Usually the added convenience is at the expense of flavor, e.g.-microwaveable frozen chicken curry.  When trying to get authentic flavor without spending an inordinate amount of time, there are many products (e.g., Shan) which give you packs of prepared spice mix.  However, most of these require the addition of other spices (i.e., garlic and ginger paste) making the cooking process more time consuming.<br /><br />Kitchen's of India Curry Paste gives you all the spices that one needs to make chicken curry that tastes just like mom's.  In fact, mom ordered a package! Total time from addition of chicken and water is about 40 minutes and the results are great.  Each package gives you enough for a meal for two.<br /><br />Only drawback is that you can't reduce the "chili hotness" without reducing flavor of other spices; however, this curry paste is milder than most similar products.  If anything, you may want to add some chili pepper to taste.<br /><br />Overall a great product for quickly and relatively inexpensively making authentic Indian chicken curry.

review/summary: I really liked this ...
review/text: I've been using KOI butter chicken paste packets for awhile, so decided to give this a try.<br /><br />I really liked it. I didn't find it too salty (and I'm usually pretty sensitive to salt), and the flavor was nice -- spicy withou being too hot.<br /><br />I made it with boneless skinless chicken thighs, and added a sweet Walla Walla onion along with the chicken, served over saffron rice.<br /><br />Butter Chicken from KOI is still my favorite, but this is a close second.

review/summary: So good wish I had purchased a tractor trailor load
review/text: I used two of the packets from a box of this to make enough for 6 full meals, you can't beat that! This paste is MUCH better than some other packet Indian food I have tried as it requires NOTHING else added! Thoroughly cook your chicken, throw in fresh vegetables, pour in a pouch, simmer for 20-30 minutes and you have enough food for 6 people, or like me, to pack for lunch all week!

review/summary: Lush flavor, healthy and very easy to cook. It's all good!
review/text: I started trying this line of curry pastes when I moved into a neighborhood that had lots of Indian and Pakistani restaurants. I came to love the food and wanted to make some at home, but didn't know how to make my own curry. Seems complicated and time-consuming. Luckily, the supermarkets near me carry foods that appeal to the same folks, and that's how I discovered this brand.<br /><br />I've enjoyed their curry pastes very much. It's so easy, the ingredients are healthy, and the best part is, it tastes like someone's Mama made it at home (and this Mama knows what she's doing). I've enjoyed their Hyderabadi and Lamb pastes, too, but this is my favorite because it's milder, more comfortable for a late night dinner with the Mrs., and goes well with lots of ingredients. Stir it in a deep frying pan or a medium saucepan, with a cup of water, and toss in the veggies or meat you think you'd like. Bring to a boil, then simmer till the meat's cooked or the veggies are as tender as you like. It can be ready in 10-12 minutes if you're just doing soft veggies like zucchini and mushroom.<br /><br />Tonight I made it with chicken breast tenderloins, peas, zucchini, a little carrot, half a cup of mushrooms, most of a Cali avocado, 1 tomato, 4-5 scallions. I simmered it 18 minutes and it's so, so tasty, rich and delicious.<br /><br />Really great that this lush, inviting food is totally free of preservatives, too! No cholesterol, low fat, low sugar, and packed with exotic flavor. I LOVE IT.

review/summary: Simple and tasty...
review/text: I have bought a variety of paste from Kitchens of India, and most of them are pretty good.  The Paste for Chicken Curry will NOT disappoint you.  With this paste, you can prepare a chicken curry dish in about 20 minutes.  To make this dish more flavorful, stir fry some garlic, onion and ginger.  Put the chicken in, then some potato and a few chunky tomatoes.  Add the paste and some milk and let simmer. If you can let it cook for about 30-40 minutes, it will taste even better!<br /><br />Highly recommend this to those who need to fix a quick dinner for the family!

review/summary: Delicious...Yummy
review/text: First let me say, I don't think I've eaten authentic Indian chicken curry so I can not rate the comparability of the two;however, I can rate base on my liking and it was delicious. I've eaten Indian cuisine before as one reviewer suggested I like it spicy. Therefore, I added .5 (half) tablespoon of chili pepper to the mixture and it gave it the kick I expect from Indian food. I only bought one packet of this and now wish I bought more. Also, the packet says use boneless meat but on the front is a picture of drumstick floating in the sauce so next time, I will use other cuts of chicken.

review/text: I know this may sound off, but I love Indian food, but I don't like spicy hot food.  More often than not, when I buy prepared Indian food like this, they are very spicy hot.  I think this is done to compensate for a lack of real flavor.  But this paste has a really nice flavor.  I can still make a better curry myself, but when I don't have the time these are great.  Plan on trying the other flavors.

review/text: Well... I cooked it with some chicken breast and I also added some potatoes, carrots, garlic and onions. It tasted good but not as good as some of the previous reviews have put it. The sauce is just not thick enough( maybe I add too much ingredient...? I don't know...) The smell was actually better than the taste. But still, it's a good product with very reasonal price; it's easy to cook and it's healthy( I guess...). Also, the shipping was fast. I would purchase it again probably. According to the reviews, the butter chicken flavor seems to receive more praise than this one. Maybe I'll try that next time.

review/text: Taste was disappointing and unappealing. Perhaps having enjoyed so many authentic and freshly prepared meals (we cook a lot of Indian dishes and use fresh spices) both at home and in restaurants, I had higher expectations than other reviewers. Would definitely NOT recommend.<br /><br />The paste was hard to mix (so that the chicken was coated evenly) and the "Sauce" consistency was runny. (And I used even less water than suggested.)<br /><br />You'd be better off with one of the many sauces in a jar (if you can stand all the salt), if you can't make fresh.<br /><br />It's too easy to just create your own sauce from scratch. Better flavor, which is the bottom line.

review/text: This soup is an excellent choice for anyone who wants a filling snack without compromising their diet. It might not be the tastiest one out there but the flavor is palatable enough, and for only 125 calories a can you'd be surprised how many wontons there are in there. A bowl of this soup with a slice of toast makes for a surprisingly satisfying &lt;200 calorie meal that keeps me full for several hours - you can't beat that!<br /><br />Something to be aware of, however, is that the sodium content of this stuff is quite high. An entire can contains almost 2200mg of sodium, which is over 90% of the recommended daily allowance for adults. So if you are trying to watch your sodium or even if you have a lot of other salty foods in your diet, this soup might not be for you.

review/summary: Excellent Source of Protein for Snacking
review/text: As a Certified Personal Trainer, I am always looking for products to recommend to my clients.  Of course, I would never recommend anything that I have not tried for myself FIRST.  Free range turkey jerky is an excellent choice for snacking, and Shelton's is by far the BEST TASTING! The flavor is not too spicy, but certainly not bland either.  The jerky's texture is very chewable, not leather-like.  Even my elderly clients can chew it. Being turkey, not beef, it saves you calories and fat.  It is a great source of (antibiotic-free) protein that does not make you feel bloated, so it perfect for snacking.  No need to worry about refrigeration after opening, so you can carry it in your gym bag and have the perfect post-workout protein snack.  I also recommend my clients keep it at work so they can avoid being tempted by the vending machines.  Amazon has it at a GREAT price!!

review/summary: Great Flavor!  Convenient Packs!
review/text: I have been buying this turkey jerky for several years.  Love it!! Because it is turkey, it contains less fat than traditional beef jerky. Do not be fooled into thinking that because it it turkey is is without flavor!!  This peppered jerky will satisfy your craving with a kick of spice.  It is not sweet or barbecue flavored, just great peppered turkey taste.  The 12, one ounce packages are perfect for the gym bag as an after workout snack, or take them to work and eat them instead of something nasty out of the vending machine! You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Thinest stale turkey jerky.
review/text: I have never had worst product.  It was extremely hard and tasteless.  I can't believe that I paid so much for it.  I gave it two stars instead of one so people will read this review.  Of course I couldn't return it because they call it food.  The package picture misrepresents the product.  Very little brown turkey,  I would never buy it at a store.  I will read the negative reviews first from now on, which were the truth, not the over abundance of five star.  I was going to say that I will never order food products again from Amazon but I have bought very good Stevia Chocolate before.

review/summary: Best natural jerkey
review/text: I tried this when I was in Southern California and cannot find it anywhere in northern California.  I like it because it is poultry and has natural ingredients with no preservatives.  I can eat it instead of a protein bar, I can take it camping, it doubles as "emergency earthquake supplies".  AND it's not full of fat or sugar.  I find the price a little high, but i make sure to have the bag last for several days.

review/summary: Terrible low quality pressed bits in tiny bags
review/text: This turkey jerky is really bad quality jerky. It comes as a bunch of tiny extremely thin pressed bits in tiny bags. The little pieces are dry, bad tasting and look like they are reconstituted without any texture to them at all. I have been getting jerky from a place called Mountain America Jerky which recently raised their prices and so I am trying Amazon.com merchants. This jerky is really really bad. The other Amazon.com merchant I have tried for turkey jerky is Golden Valley which is much much better than this jerky. Don't get this stuff at all. It is really bad. Try the Golden Valley jerky also here at amazon. That at least has some decent flavor and you can tell it once was a turkey! This stuff is just awful.

review/summary: A Beacon for Bacon
review/text: Neuske's Bacon is simply the most divine bacon eating experience you'll ever have.  Smoked in Wisconsin over applewood, it is delectable, luscious even.  They cut it lean so that there is no rubbery, fatty bits like you find in store-bought brands, yet they leave enough in to give it that robust flavor.  It is worth noting that America's Test Kitchen did a Taste Test of Bacon, in which Neuske's was a participant.  It did NOT come out as No.1, because tasters thought it was "too smoky".  If you like smoky bacon like I do, that sounds like crazy talk, and you should definitely try this bacon.  The results of the taste test indicates to me that there are those who prefer their bacon less smoky, and I suppose that if you are one of those people, you may not like this bacon after all (even thought it is the best ever).<br /><br />Be careful though: once you eat Neuske's and love it, you won't be satisfied with store-bought ever again!

Nice people, and men just love this gourmet bacon. Will definitely use them again next Xmas!

We haven't tried the peppered bacon yet but looking forward to it.  This is expensive bacon as one reviewer complained about so it's not something you would have every weekend.  As an occasional treat though it's probably the best bacon I have ever had.

review/summary: Wonderful Flavors
review/text: I have been using this product for years and almost can't live without it in my kitchen.  It adds a wonderful flavor to baked goods as well as savory dishes.  It is a convenient substitute for citrus zest in any recipe. The bottles a small, but a little of the oil goes a long way, so this supply lasts me a while.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is difficult to find this product in retail stores these days.  It was really nice to see it available here on Amazon.  However, you should know that you can also purchase the product from the Boyajian website directly for more than 50% less than Amazon's current price.  Boyajian shipping is free when you order $50, I was able to fill out my order with holiday gifts for some home gourmet cooks I know.  Regardless of where you choose purchase it, you won't regret the great flavor it adds to marinades, sauces, salad dressings, cakes and cookies.

review/summary: What a difference oil makes!
review/text: These oils are great to use instead of zest or extract.  They are packed with flavor and taste fresh, not fake or alcoholic like many extracts tend to do.  I bought a glass eye dropper to dispense the oil, do not use one with a plastic tube as it can damage it and leave the plastic scarred.  Keep this in mind too if you are using the oils to flavor seltzer water, use glass and not a plastic tumbler.  It tastes fresher and more full bodied than any store-bought flavored seltzer and you only need one drop for a 24 oz glass.<br /><br />I use the lime in Thai dishes, the lemon in chicken marinades and a drop of the orange in cookies is very tasty -- there are a million uses for them.  You can even use them for cocktails.<br /><br />Be aware that once opened, you must keep them in the refrigerator.<br /><br />The gift pack contains an ounce of each oil in a cute little bottle with a narrow neck.  The amazon price breaks down to less than $3 a bottle which I think is a great value.  Since I only need a few drops per recipe, they last a long time.  It is also nice to have the smaller bottles so you have fresher oil; a 1 ounce bottle in the fridge is fresher at the end of its use than a 3 ounce bottle sitting in the fridge for three times as long.  I keep the extras in my pantry until they are needed.

These oils are incredible.<br /><br />I fancy myself a home bartender and like mixing up different drinks. These oils are perfect for me. I can mix a world class top-shelf lemon-drop or mojito with these oils.<br /><br />On a simpler level, just a drop in a glass of seltzer makes for an excellent treat, just like (and yet way better than) flavored Calistoga. They taste exactly like the rind of each fruit, as if I'd zested a fresh lime right over my glass.<br /><br />They also come in handy for home-made chocolate and candy making, baking, even marinades and salad dressings. I use these all the time. Since it only takes a drop or two each use, my bottles are still all pretty full.<br /><br />Best gift ever for foodies.<br /><br />Thanks Mom!!

Although I use grated peel and juice, the oil intensifies the taste.  The lemon oil makes my Italian vegetable soup pop.  That little bottle of lime oil is calling me to make a key lime pie soon.  Remember only a little is needed and a bottle will last a long time.  I suggest refrigerating after opening.  I am especially pleased that this comes in a 3-pack of smaller quantities, so it will stay fresher longer.

review/summary: An excellent option vertical sprouting
review/text: This is the larger size of the Sprout Master sprouter, great for larger batches of leafy sprouts or bean sprouts. The optional tray divider makes it easy to make larger batches or separate smaller sprout batches. Half of this tray still has more capacity than the whole of one of the Sprout Master small trays. If you're growing for one or two people I would recommend the "Sprout Master Mini Triple" instead. Coming with three trays the mini triple would allow you to grow a more diverse or more staggered crop.<br /><br />The two "lids" that come with this tray are exactly the same. Put one below to catch any water and use the one on top if you want to block off light (this helps prevent the growth of green leaves, which is usually how bean sprouts are grown). The Sprout Master's drainage holes allow excess water to drain off very effectively.<br /><br />If you've sprouted in a jar before, you'll probably find this to be much easier. Hold the tray under running cool water two or three times a day, then allow excess water to run off before putting the tray away. The sprouts should be thoroughly rinsed to prevent spoilage, kept moist at all times, but not allowed to sit in water. (By comparison, with jar sprouting you'd need to fill and drain the jar of sprouts repeatedly to rinse the sprouts well, then it's more difficult to get them properly drained.)<br /><br />One minor complaint is that some of the smallest seeds can get caught in the drain holes. In my experience, broccoli is large enough to be safe, but with alfalfa or clover you might get a few seeds stuck. When you're cleaning the tray after use you may need to get a small poking instrument to knock one or two out again. The "Easy Sprouter" device doesn't have this problem, but allows slightly less light to reach your sprouts because of it's shape. Neither is a very significant complaint, and I find that the Easy Sprouter gets sufficient light for most purposes.

review/text: I bought my first SproutMaster years ago at the Dowling Orchard Market when passing through Banning, California (back when they sold them).<br /><br />Through a bit pricey for a plastic tray, I cannot complain about the ease of use or the quality of the sprouts grown. The divider IS helpful to grow different sprouts, BUT it is more helpful to grow the same type of sprout in two different stages of growth. This way, you can always have fresh sprouts handy at anytime.<br /><br />They do grow fast and the Sprout Master makes it so simple to care for them.

review/text: This is my first sprouter, so I have no basis for comparison.  I looked at a lot of products when I was purchasing this one, and I feel that it's the best tray sprouter on the market for the price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Easy to use<br />-Allows for nice aeration<br />-Tray system works well as bottom or lid (I switch top & bottom after every rinse to minimize bacteria & mold growth)<br />-Great size, perfect crop size for two people.  If I get really in to sprouting I may purchase another large size and have the crops rotating.<br />-Holes are small enough that very few seeds get stuck<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Small seeds can get stuck in holes<br />-Sprouts will grow through holes and can be hard to pull out without breaking the roots<br />-Not dishwasher safe, and needs to be bleached each time<br />-Not the sturdiest plastic, so I doubt it will last more than 2 years without cracking<br /><br />I have only had one failure so far, buckwheat groats.  They rotted, and I suspect that I did not rinse them voraciously enough.  All other crops (salad mixes with primarily alfalfa & radish, some lentils) have been absolutely perfect with very little maintenance.

review/summary: I'm a SPROUTER!
review/text: Before I bought this sprouter, I used a jar with a screen lid on it and had failure after failure. I don't know what I was doing wrong, but it seemed like I never could get those alfalfa sprouts to "sprout maturity"! Since I got this baby, I am the green queen of sprouting! (at least I feel like it...)I was a little concerned about the plastic stuff, but it seems very stable and does not impart any plastic "flavor" to the greens. I am so pumped that I am moving on to other sproutables. It is very easy to use, and I rinse once in the morning and once before I go to bed. That seems to be enough, but you can rinse more often. I have good water (no chlorine or fluoride) and with this tray my sprouts grow, grow, grow!<br /><br />When I'm ready to harvest them, the "mat" they form is easy to sort of peel up. I put them in a large salad spinner and fill it with water and sort of loosen them up, freeing the hulls to float on the top. Then I get a small strainer (everyone has one of those, right?) and put it over the kitchen sink drain and pour out the water into the strainer. That's where the hulls go (then into the compost bin) instead of down the drain! Then, I whir the salad spinner and get the sprouts "dry" and in they go to a container in the fridge with the lid cracked--so they can "breathe" a little bit.<br /><br />I have been doing this since I started growing with this sprouter. I understand you can actually stack these to grow more, but I will have to wait a bit before I become that adventurous.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, one more thing....After you soak the seeds for 6 or more hours (directions come with the sprouter or you can go to their website) and have them in the sprouter, I adjust the lid so it's open about an inch. Gives them room to breathe.<br /><br />Get it! Your body will thank you for growing LIVE food for it! Be good to yourself and discover sprouting---so much CHEAPER than the stores!!

review/summary: SUPERIOR to a lame jar
review/text: I first tried sprouting with a jar with a drain lid. It was hard to drain the water all the way out, it was a pain to rinse the seeds, and my sprouts would rot, before they even sprouted. Air couldn't get to them, and I live in Nebraska, a very arid region.<br /><br />Then I got this thing. If you can't grow sprouts in this, just rinse them more. It drains effortlessly. The instructions are ridiculously easy to follow. You can grow tons of sprouts really fast. I grew, tall, strong, deep green, and super potent sprouts in a matter of days. They will not go bad if you keep them in here and keep rinsing them, I rinse about 3 times a day, but you could probably get away with once depending on where you live. You will basically have a living, growing food, that you can eat at your leisure.<br /><br />The smallest seed I have put in them so far is radish, but I'm sure smaller seeds could work, and you could always put a growing sponge on the bottom.<br /><br />During the winter I will get a second one because it will be one of the only ways to get fresh greens in my area, and I'm a vegetarian, so that is super important to me.<br /><br />These are made in the US.

review/summary: Just OK for me...
review/text: The Sprout Master is made nicely and looks like it will last a long time.  I disagree with those that say it is flimsy.  It seems sturdy to me.  In terms of quality, it seems fine.  But in terms of growing sprouts from small seeds, there are 2 main problems, it seems:<br /><br />(1) It has pin-size holes for drainage, and small seeds get stuck in these and grow their roots through them. I am mostly making broccoli sprouts and alfalfa sprouts (small seeds). Probably the Sprout Master would work fine with sunflower seeds, nuts, beans, wheat, or other seeds that are at least as large as a mung bean. What happens with the small seeds, such as the broccoli sprouts, is that they grow their roots through the holes, and their roots make a thick mat underneath. So then it is very hard to remove the entire sprout. The roots break off, so then we have only the tops of the sprouts. I'm able to scrape the roots off of the backside and put them in the salads too, but it's just not as nice as the whole sprout unbroken. I don't have this problem with my other sprouting system, the Tompson & Morgan Seed Sprouter - Two-tiered (also available at Amazon). It works so much better because it has slots instead of pinholes.<br /><br />The broccoli sprouts don't make a mat of roots underneath the tray with the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter. They just make sprouts like you would see in the grocery store. I've also noticed that my sprouts grow much faster in the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter. I've done many comparisons, and it always is like this. I am not sure why. So, all things said, I wish that I hadn't bought the Sprout Master Triple Sprouter. I would have bought several more Tompson and Morgan Sprouters instead. They look very attractive and are a lot easier for me to deal with than the Sprout Master. I'm sure the Sprout Master is great for people that are using the larger seeds. Maybe I will start doing some larger seeds/nuts/beans too, but my main interest is with broccoli sprouts, alfalfa sprouts, radishes sprouts, etc., all of which have tiny seeds.<br /><br />(2) Clean-up:  The other thing about the Sprout Master, as others have noted, is that it's a bit difficult to clean small seeds out of the holes. You have to use the tip of a paperclip to poke stuff out sometimes.<br /><br />Once again the Tompson & Morgan is so much easier -- with their slots instead of pin-size holes, the seeds and other stuff fall right out during a quick wash and rinse. No paperclips and poking needed!<br /><br />And the Tompson & Morgan has gone through my dishwasher many times without harm. Sprout Master says don't put theirs in dishwasher, so I have not.<br /><br />***By the way, if anyone has some ideas for how I can make the Sprout Master work better with my little seeds, I would love to read your comments. Thanks! ***

review/summary: Great little sprouter
review/text: I highly recommend this sprouter.  The lid and the base (they appear identical) fit perfectly into the sprouting area.  It's easy to clean.  If you are sprouting lentils or other smaller seed I suggest you don't only pour water over them, but also shake them up, as I had a thick root cover on the bottom the first time I sprouted a pound of them.  That took a little more time than I'd hoped to get clean, but I think it's an easy fix with shaking them up twice a day.  I bought two of these, one for me and one for my sister, and I was able to stack them to sprout garbanzos in one and lentils in the other.  They don't fit each other exactly, but it was close enough.

review/text: I sprouted fenugreek seeds in this sprouter with great success. However, you might want to know that it is not dishwasher safe. So when those sprouts clog up the strain holes, you need to unclog them with a paper clip or something like that. One might sprout just as effectively using a fine, large strainer or one of those large mesh grease splatter covers. I still highly recommend this sprouter. But try a fine grease splatter cover first though just to make sure sprouting is something you really want to do.

review/summary: Great sprouter!!
review/text: I've now run two batches of alfalfa sprouts and mung beans through this sprouter and I am LOVING it.  I have used the jar method before but this tray system is SOOOO much easier and seems to give MUCH better results.  The alfalfa turns out particularly nice, ending up almost like a lawn or carpet from which you literally tug a nice little pinch of sprouts.  And I think the tray is the perfect size.  I disagree with some complaints I've read in other reviews that the plastic is too light/flimsy;  I think the materials and construction are just about right and I don't anticipate having any trouble keeping it in working order for many sprouting cycles.  I bought another one to give away as a gift!  Recommended!!

review/summary: Sprout Master wobbles across the finish line
review/text: The Sprout Master standard/larger trays in either single or stackable formats leave just a little to be desired in hardiness and instructions. They do the job of sprouting fairly well, but it may take a couple of tries to get exactly what you're looking for.<br /><br />Cons:<br />If you're only making leafy green sprouts for one or two, halve the recommended seed amounts in the chart provided. You'll get better airflow, too. A damp lightweight dish towel over the top works better than the provided tray for moisture and air circulation. The construction is a little flimsy, with the tray lid and catch pan of the exact same design. This means you can buy a single sprouter and then buy a second, but keep a towel underneath a single or stack, because the trays don't have much of a lip and even fairly small amounts of water can end up on your socks. The sprouting trays just feel...delicate. I've already cracked one washing it with a scrubber brush. The trays do not seal well enough that I would be willing to hike with them, but with the lids inverted into storage containers, nothing leaks in the fridge. Also, they're not dishwasher safe.<br /><br />The provided instructions leave just a little bit of doubt about whether the lid should be used during sprouting, under which conditions, or reserved for the crisper function. In our 72-degree home, it actually works better with the lid lightly overtop a lightweight dishtowel. They still stack that way. The trays also make it difficult to flush seed hulls from the sprouts, so instead of following their directions, I rinse my sprouts in a colander to get rid of the hulls before I put them back in the tray to green.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The instructions come with a guide for the amount of seed to use in a whole tray, half the tray with the divider, and with the two mini options as well as the amount of time various types of seeds should take to sprout and how many days of light they should have for greening up. It also includes the good advise of trying the seeds every day once they've grown out some, to find your perfect sweetness level. The trays seal well enough for the fridge, but not really for a backpack, as the mini is advertised to do. The dividers allow you to stagger "crops" and grow different types of sprouts. Because they're modular, you can buy a single, then decide you're into it and buy a triple and stack those, scale back down to one or two trays, and interchange the lids/catch pan between all the trays, presuming you buy all mini's or all standard/large sized trays. They more efficiently use counter space and fridge space than round designs, and they seal better in the fridge than the two sets of round trays I have. I use the divider even when growing the same seeds, because the partition increases the stability of the trays and makes them more resistant to cracking when a flat of eggs ends up on top of them in the fridge.<br /><br />Bottom line, they're nice for the money, versatility, and size considerations, but they're not the sturdiest and some clarity in the directions could really boost the nice set of sprouting guides that come with them.

review/summary: No eating roots for me!
review/text: Sorry, but I only like to eat the tops of the sprouts. I only grow broccoli sprouts at the moment. With this sprouter, the roots grow down through the holes and the sprouts grow up vertically. To prevent the roots from matting under the tray, I raise the tray up by putting a flat rock (from my yard!) in a foil baking pan. (appx 11x13 from the dollar store). I fill the pan 3/4 with water, and set the tray on the rock. The roots go down to the water and drink it up. I change the water and rinse the sprouts daily. When ready, I pull the sprouts out the top of the tray, cut off most of the dangling roots, and I'm all set. Easy to clean under running water with dish cloth. I also soak the tray in vinegar water before re sprouting. No, seeds do not get stuck in the holes. Sometimes a few roots get stuck, but they are easily dislodged with the dish cloth rubbed over the holes, front and back. I always thought sprouts needed sun, and I was using a grow light over them, especially in the winter. The directions said they can grow in the dark! Did I misunderstand? I decided to turn off the grow light and just place them on a table by the window that gets a little light in the afternoon, and they grow just fine. I'm now ordering the set of three trays for a better value, and I'll try other seeds. I may have to eat the roots on the larger seeds, but I can manage that!

review/summary: Artificial flavors? Seriously?
review/text: It's hard to find a good quality whole leaf tea in bags, and the great reviews this brand received were pretty convincing. So I gave it a shot, in spite of my usual preference for organic or fair trade teas. Sadly, there is an unpleasantly strong perfumey odor and taste to this Earl Grey and when I looked at the ingredients, the reason was quite clear. It is comprised of whole leaf black tea along with natural and ARTIFICIAL flavors. Why the artificial flavors? Isn't a top quality oil of bergamot enough? It is for me. Unfortunately, grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon, so I'm stuck with three tins of tea that I will probably never drink.

review/summary: 5 stars for flavor; condition upon delivery - mess
review/text: These add a creamy,dynamic cinnamon/vanilla flavor to almost anything but once in a while I experience a very strange aftertaste with the chocolate flavor (just the chocolate: I've tried the choc, cinn/van and Irish Cream),usually when I use 2 vs just one in my beverage.<br /><br />The packaging, however, leaves a lot to be desired and unless you want a lot of work when this arrives, you might want to rethink this purchase. In recent weeks, I've purchased 3 cases of this product (that is 12 boxes of 50 single serve cups) in 3 flavors for the local emergency shelter here in Western, MA due to the tornadoes that ripped through my community and those of my family and friends. I am so thankful I looked at this product before just bringing it to the make-shift kitchens and coffee setups on the back of pickup trucks. This is what I experienced. What follows is actually my 'cut and paste' comments from one of my 'leave packaging comments' for Amazon, so it lists 2 cases vs 3. I purchased 1 first, then had second thoughts and went back and bought the additional 2 flavors (creamy chocolate, cinnamon vanilla (excellent flavor, by the way) and Irish Cream (a bit too subtle in flavor for me-could have a bit more oomph). As such, you'll see me refer to just 2 below.<br /><br />Exterior shipping box was fine and interior 'case' holding product perfectly intact. However, contents (50 in each)are a sticky, gooey, unusable mess. I purchased 2 flavors/2 cases = 8 cartons = 400 of this product and all 8 cartons are a disgusting disappointment. While the majority of the single serve cups are fine, a large handful in every one of the 50-pack boxes are squished, cracked or just ripped open. Contents spilled over the rest of the single serve cups throughout the boxes that are now slimy, sticky and tacky, with what looks like dried and/or tacky curdled milk all over them. I had to throw away 46 cups total and wash every other single serve cup by hand and then find another container to hold them all. I sure won't be buying these again.

review/summary: Poor Quality Product
review/text: When looking at buying creamer, I mistakenly believed that this product would pair well with the coffee I enjoy (a cinnamon / vanilla flavored coffee).  Listed below are my opinions about said creamer when used in both normal coffee (unflavored medium roast) as well as flavored coffee.  Both types of coffee were ground that day.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />The amount of creamer you receive borders on the ridiculous.  The package has to contain near 8 lbs. of creamer.<br />The creamer is individually packaged and arrives in four cartons (each containing 50 creamers).<br />The cartons are easy to open and have a flap to allow for easy access.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />The creamer is VERY weak.  To receive the same texture / coloring / flavoring as a traditional creamer (one in a bottle), you must use roughly 50% more of this creamer.<br />The vanilla taste is very minimal.<br />The cinnamon taste is very prevalent.<br />the cinnamon taste is rather repugnant and almost has a sour taste to it.<br />The individual creamers are rather hard to open (not that they are difficult to grab the flap, but there is a ton of glue used, and most often (7/10 times) will tear because the flap is glued down to heavily.<br /><br />~~~~<br /><br />In all, I would not recommend this product.  I've actually tried to give the creamer away to several people, but after tasting it, no one wants it.  Even at work, with the ~175 remaining creamers sitting there, after a week, the first container is still not empty (meaning, that of the 175 I brought, there are still more than 150 sitting there).

review/summary: A nice kitten chow, easy on the digestion
review/text: I have generally fed Hills Science Diet to my cats over the years. This year I started over (my elderly cats have passed on) with a young cat and her litter. The mother was up and down with her apetite in the hot weather, during pregnancy and nursing, and not keeping a good weight. She also had an upset tummy off and on. So I tried a few different chows, and Purina One certainly agreed with her the best. Once or twice I went back to other brands (including the regular Purina chow) and they just did not agree with her. She also seemed hungry all the time on the regular Purina chow.<br /><br />Kittens are now 3 months old and glowing with health, as is their mom. The vet sang their praises at vaccination time, and even asked me what I was feeding them. It pays to try different brands if your cat is not happy. This one sure worked for us.<br /><br />The price is $6.95 at our local supermarket, though, so I won't be buying it here!

review/summary: great starter food for kitten
review/text: I have a year old cat and she's at the end of her very last bag of Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula. I am very skeptical on what kinds of food I allow her to eat. I want the very best food for her and this product seemed to be the best. I had to also decide about Hills Science Diet but she would hardly even taste it! There are so many different kinds of dry cat/kitten foods that when all was said and done, Purina One really worked well. Purina One not only is good for her, but in addition also helped her develop a very shiny, soft coat. The ingredients are good/healthy. I'm now at the point of researching what kind of cat food she will be eating, but wanted to share that she (and I) had a very positive experience with Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula and would recommend it to future kittens!!

review/text: This is the only way to buy cat food for 3 cats.  I have 2 fully grown cats and a kitten and they will not touch any other food except the "Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula Cate Food."  It is hard to find even at Walmart so sitting in front of the computer and ordering and then opening the door 3 or 4 days later to get the package is much easier than driving 15 minutes and then the store not having the food. This is great! Getting ready to do it again!

review/summary: Awesome way to buy cat food!
review/text: My 2 cats are little piggys and they eat a lot so I have to buy large amounts of cat food. But I hate buying the super big bags because I only have the 2 cats. By the time I get to the bottom of the BIG bag it's stale and I don't like stale food, so why would my cats? Also, it keeps the bugs down because the open bag is small and it's not just sitting there. I also priced the big bags compared to the bulk lot of smaller ones here and this was surprisingly cheaper. I'm going to be buying this way from now on.

review/summary: Prices better with Subscribe and Save
review/text: Cats and ferrets love this food.  Since we have a multiple-pet household, we are always looking for the best price.  The price on Amazon has been very good and at times, too high.  Currently, the subscribe and save price is a good deal, just make sure you compare prices before ordering.

review/summary: Prices keep going up!!!!
review/text: I like the product, there is nothing wrong with that. Our cats love it! My problem is with the price. Just a few weeks ago I was paying $32.16 for 6 bags to be sent to me twice a month. Now I notice I am being charged $42.72!!! What the heck. If the prices don't go back down I may not be getting this much longer. At the least I could have been e-mailed letting me know about the price change but I didn't even get that. For me to find out this way with an automatic withdrawal from my account is pretty messed up. Amazon should rethink the way they do things otherwise they will definately be losing my business.

review/summary: Wonderful, Dark, Rich, and Smooth
review/text: I go though about 4 k-cups per day, and as you can imagine, I have tried a wide variety.  Caribou Mahogany has taken the lead for me.  I favor non or lightly flavored dark roast extra-bold k-cups, and drink my coffee black.  I found this to be strong, yet very smooth. No bitter aftertaste.  It is even good cold a few hours later.  My new ATF!  Now if only Amazon will begin offering it at a reasonable price, so I don't have to shop elsewhere...

review/summary: Smooth and tasty and an absolute dream come true for those who enjoy dark roasts!
review/text: Although I've only been able to try three of Caribou's k cup blends (Mahogany as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474VPLI">Caribou Coffee, Daybreak Morning Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>), I've found that Caribou consistently produces the highest quality k cups. They are head and shoulders above their competitors like Green Mountain and Van Houtte.<br /><br />I should mention that Caribou's Daybreak blend is far and away my favorite k cup flavor of the 20 or so I've been able to sample so far. But I enjoy a flavorful medium roast. My boyfriend, on the other hand, prefers an extra bold dark roast. After our favorable experience with the Caribou brand before, we picked up a box of this coffee and hoped that it would be a great choice for a dark blend.<br /><br />Let me just say that Mahogany is full of smokey delicious flavor. It's quite strong and dark, but there is no rancid bitterness or acidity that accompanies a lot of the dark roasts. This coffee packs a powerful punch. Although that isn't normally my thing, I can enjoy a cup of this with milk and a bit of sweetener. My boyfriend adores it, though, and it has become a staple blend for him. I will still drink this on occasion, but it's a bit too potent for me.<br /><br />I think this is the best dark roast I've had the chance to try.

review/text: It's good. If you like darker, but not bitter, it's a decent cup of Joe. I will buy it again. Guests of mine that also had it commented on how they liked it. The flavor is a crowd pleaser, but nothing really exceptional to it that I could call out.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I love the bold taste of this coffee. I am not a coffee snob, but this is one of my favorite coffees of all time. Mahogany was the coffee I made at home, and was the main reason I waited so long to try the Kuerig. When I found these, I immediately ordered two boxes and a new Kuerig for the house. I was not disappointed at all, as the great taste still comes through strong....which does slow down my wife as it is a little stronger than we used to make it in the regular coffee pot. Well, the good news is I have found a coffee that she loves, Doughnut Shop, and one that I love, this one, and we can have them both at the same time.

review/text: I'd order this flavor from Amazon.  This is a rich, full tasting coffee that is just<br />a couple of heartbeats higher than the more reasonably priced Morning Blend.  I have<br />three K-Kups left from my last order.  They're being rationed for special moments!

review/summary: Simply the best at the best price!
review/text: I got hooked on Green Mountain Southern Pecan coffee when my husband and I lived in Maine. I stocked up on it when we moved back to the South and continued to order it in bulk until a couple of months ago when I got my Keurig. Brewing it one cup at a time is the next best thing to living in Maine and being able to go to just about any convenience store and take my pick of the flavors (I almost always chose Southern Pecan). I've ordered the K-cups from Amazon three times now and just placed my fourth order, the second with this company. The last arrived in record time and the price can't be beat--believe me, I've checked. Add in the free shipping and you have a definite winner!
