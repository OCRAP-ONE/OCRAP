review/summary: Best whiskey sour mix for lazy bartenders
review/text: Who'd have thought a powder mix would deliver such a tasty whiskey sour. Soooo much better that bottled mixers. Just the right amount of sweet and sour, tart enough yet a wonderful complement to a good bourbon whiskey. I use a little less water that instructed per package (I prefer my flavor to be a bit more potent) and once the cocktail is mixed I add a few dashes of Angostura Bitters along with a fruity garnish. Yummy!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HQMLX6">Bar-Tender's Instant Whiskey Sour Mix, 8-Count 4.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Fabulous old time Whiskey Sour Cocktail!!!
review/text: We have been fans of the old time whiskey sour cocktails and are delighted that this product is available!  It is such a disappointment to go out to a lounge and have bartenders who do not know how to make a true cocktail.  This product is a wonderful alternative to having to make your own sour mix and egg white froth at home.  You won't be disappointed.

review/text: Update: I'm still stuck on this coffee. I can't find anything that's as good at this point. Nothing really compares anymore. The finer grind is so much better than coarser crap, and the flavor and body are unmatched.<br /><br />Flavorful grind. Melitta's stuff is surprisingly good. This mix is dark and full of flavor, the finer grind produces more for less, and it seems to hold flavor longer than others for the entire week. After going through a bag of Starbucks Sumatra that smelled-up the house but lost aroma quickly along with an obvious lack of drug potency, the Enchanted Evening has been a great all-day shot of uppers that lasts. Fair trade and organic? I haven't found any overpaid beetle shells in it yet. Bottom line: Some of the best ground coffee I've had, period.

review/summary: Almost perfect canned Tofu...but 3.5 stars
review/text: If you don't like anything canned, don't look here, if you don't mind canned...Hi.<br /><br />My subscribe and save Tofu.  This item could have been perfect but alas there is a major drawback and that is salt.  This is much more accurate if it was sold as beancurd in brine as it is tofu, salt and water.  Typically if you go and buy other water packed tofu, you may find it has from 0-10 mg of sodium.  This one has 292 mg per serving, that's a huge difference.  The "brine" affects it enough that the tofu is essentially salted and you will need to adjust your recipes to take this into account or you'll end up with oen salty dish.  As it is, I eat these "plain" and don't need further salt or soy sauce.<br /><br />Perhaps because of the canning process that it needs to have salt in order to be preserved or perhaps not, so keep that in mind.  I'm not sure on the science of canning.  I have provided nutrition data taken from the Roland foods website.  The cans seem be updated now and the only difference between the nutrition data being 59 calories on the can vs 60 on the website.<br /><br />I love my "almost" plain tofu.  3.5 stars if I could have...5 stars of course if there wasn't so much sodium.

review/summary: Jelly Belly's are the Best
review/text: Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!

review/summary: The Queen of Italian Cheeses
review/text: Parmesan is known as the queeen of Italian cheese. Kraft Grated Parmesan, 16-Ounce Plastic Canister (Pack of 3).  Kraft Grated Parmesan cheese has been around since 1945.  The container has been updated, but the cheese is still the queen.  There are more delicious variations, such as freshly grated . . . and now Kraft has a kind with the grater included so we can  grate our cheese to serve it fresh.  I still buy large amounts of the good basic grated parmesan in the refillable green shaker container. It is quick, and most people are in a hurry these days.  It will keep if we leave it on the table when we eat at the cafeteria.  Ususally at home, I keep it in the refrigerator.<br /><br />It is great for a wide range of dishes, including pastas, soups, sauce, snack, bread, and meat. With only ten calories per teaspoon, we can sprinkle on all we want without feeling guilty.  The cheese taste is one I crave, and eating Kraft's Parmesan is a good way to satisfy that craving for cheese.<br /><br /> Perhaps parmesan cheese has been around since the eighth century B. C. or was it developed about 400 years ago in in the Italian city of Parma?  There was a story that near Parma there was a mountain made entirely of parmesan cheese.  On top of the mountain a community of macaroini makers cooked hot pasta, bathed it in butter, and rolled it down the mountain to the hungry people below. There is a legend that it was used by Roman legionniares becaue it lasted throughout their long journeys.  (I found these stories on Kraft websites, and I could not resist sharing them with you.)<br /><br />Some of our recipes in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook and The Collard Patch call for large amounts of Kraft Parmesan.  At my house we use Kraft Parmesan cheese in lasagna, meatballs,  collard tortellini, and casseroles containing collard greens! It's delicious.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.

review/summary: It Is What It Is
review/text: I'll give Kraft credit where it's due. I think short of growning up in an Italian household, most of us only know parmesan cheese thanks to Kraft. In terms of availability and convenience, Kraft has "all" the others beat. And for the vast majority of North Americans, if you know no better, Kraft is better than fine.<br /><br />However, if you are willing to forego a little convenience and challenge your tastebuds a little, try buying an inexpensive rotary cheese grater ($5 - $10) and some fresh properly aged parmesan and grate your own. The rewards of the extra effort will be immediate. You won't believe that the two (Kraft and fresh) are even the same category of cheese.<br /><br />Compared to it's alternative, Kraft Parmesan is expensive, flavourless and just plain lousy. But it will always have a place where convenience matters most.

review/text: Sadly, this pumpkin soup tasted nothing like pumpkin to me. The pumpkins used in this product are from Taitung Taiwan. Not sure the variety grown there but I'm used to the North American pumpkins with that distinct sweet "pumpkin pie" flavor. That's what I was hoping for when I ordered this soup.<br /><br />Now, this soup wasn't horrible. It did have an earthy vegetable flavor, just not actual pumpkin. Maybe some type of gourd, just not the one I'm used to. So after a few spoonfuls, I couldn't finish. Just not for me. The description on the box said it's sweet but I didn't detect any sweetness at all.

review/summary: This Tea is Lovely
review/text: I'm a fan!  This tea is not bitter, and forgives a wide range of temps and steep times.  In fact, my favorite way to drink it is to throw a bag into room-temperature water to flavor the water.  This works well through 3-4 refills, by which time I tend to forget and leave the room.  Steeping for hours does finally bring the bitterness out, so that's when I toss it.<br /><br />The "green" flavor of the tea is much stronger than most white teas.  It reminds me of a white and green 'fusion' tea by Stash, though I prefer this Revolution tea.  The pear flavor is delicious, tastes like real pear, and matches the strength of the strong white tea (that sounds funny as I type it - strong white tea?!) well.  If you like green AND white tea, and you like pears, give this a shot.  I'm really very fond of it.<br /><br />The package comes with a "resealable freshness bag," though I've never felt the need for one before and I'm not sure I need one now.  It doesn't get in the way, and it's there if I want to travel without risking leaking tea dust . . . not that there is any tea dust.  The tea leaves are as large as loose leaf tea, which might be why it holds up through more steeps than anything else I have in a teabag, and they're very green.  I suspect it still has more moisture in the leaves than most teas, but since I'm reluctant to rip a bag open to perform tests, that will remain a suspicion.<br /><br />There's no string on the teabags, and they're the fancy pyramid type.  They feel very nice.  This is a distant concern compared to the flavor (which, as I mentioned, I am very fond of), but it's worth a mention.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I like the taste of black tea and since I am pregnant I didn't want to be drinking caffeinated tea.  But from the taste of this brewed coffee, I can't tell it is not caffeinated at all.  Tastes very strong so  you don't need a lot to brew a great cup of tea.  Nice full flavor with a hint of apricot.  This is a great price for the tea...you get a lot.

review/text: This is a honestly good tea given the price, it doesn't have the complex aroma and aftertaste of the more expensive teas, but for this price is amazing cosidering it's 80% as good for less than half of the price.<br />Pu Erh is a polarizing tea: people either love it or hate it. An advantage of the reduced price is that you can give it a try without expending too much, if you like it you can try the more expensive and flavourful blends.<br />If you're looking for an everyday Pu Erh tea without breaking the bank or just want to find if it's for you this is an excellent tea, but if you're a connoisseur maybe you'd like to try somewhere else.

review/summary: I have found the weight loss "Holy Grail!"
review/text: I have found the perfect combination that is helping me lose weight. First off let me tell you that I lost 50+ pounds the good old fashioned way...diet and exercise. Then I hit a plateau and it refused to come off. For 3 months I have gone up and down 6 pounds. Desperate to get over the hump, and lose the last 60 pounds I researched all the different products that are touted as "miracle" remedies. And I actually think I found the perfect combination for me. I have lost about 1 and a half pounds a day since I started!<br /><br />What you ask? Drumroll please. My combination is:<br /><br />1. HCG diet and homeopathic drops<br />2. Pu Ehr tea<br />3. Raspberry ketones<br />4. Green coffee bean extract<br />5. Konjac/Glucomannann root<br /><br />Its expensive, but works... at least for me.

review/text: Colby is our favorite type of cheese, so I had high hopes for this. Unfortunately, it was horrible. It had a weird, rubbery texture, and the taste was bland and nasty. For the high price I paid for both the cheese and the shipping, I expected so much more. The cheese at my local deli is far superior, and for the price of 1 lb of this, I could have bought at least 5 lbs of it.

review/summary: Oh my goodness, this tea...
review/text: Cranberry. Cranberry is another one of those flavors that brings out very distinct memories for me. Thanksgiving at my grandmother's house, not for the cranberry sauce (which I loathe), but for the cranberry juice she always had on hand. I loved it! And she'd mix it with a bit of ginger ale for me and oh, I felt so grown up...my first cocktail! Virgin, of course. We lost her the year I started college, so every time I taste anything with cranberry, I think of her. Then growing up, my mom taught me how to make this delicious cranberry-orange bread with fresh cranberries, and that bread is why I always have cranberries in my freezer. I made it for my in-laws the first Christmas after the wedding and now they look forward to it every year. Maybe after I've tried this straight I'll need to try it with some orange juice. But cranberry is a flavor very near and dear to my heart, so I am very much looking forward to trying this one. The health benefits of cranberries aren't such a bad thing either, and since I don't drink juice anymore, this might be a good way for me to get them.<br /><br />This blew my socks off. The scent when the package is opened is a sweet cranberry, not the tart berry I was looking for, but I can't bring myself to complain. I put about a quarter of a teaspoon in a small mug, added about 75-80 C water, some sugar, and frothed it up. Then I added robots (by which I mean ice in the shape of robots) and a touch of cold water to make a beautiful iced tea. I am so far from disappointed it hurts. This is lovely. I didn't expect to like this one nearly as much as I do, but I am in love. I'm definitely seeing the berry in cranberry, but there's also a hint of tartness in the middle of the sip. I am so surprised, I honestly didn't expect to be wowed by this. But I am and I am going to restock on it ASAP. I can't wait to try it blended with some vanilla matcha or some orange juice...yum. I don't have a lot of experience with cranberry outside of the little fruits baked into muffins, but I think I need to branch out and try some new things!

This product delivers what it promises with the heat (which is the only reason it got 2 stars), but the taste is so unpalatable it's not worth it. They roast the peppers which tastes more like they were dropped in the cigar ashtray, covered up with spices trying to mask it. Very disappointed. I hope the rest of their product line doesn't taste like this. I'll (apprehensively) find out what their chips and jerky taste like today .

review/summary: changed flavor
review/text: These used to be the best tart cherries I had ever tried and I purchased dozens of bags for pies and for snacking.  They switched to a different source for their cherries and the flavor went south.  The last 3 bags I tried over 6 months were all bad.  This is too bad.  They had a great product.

review/summary: Pleasingly Plump !!!
review/text: Was hesitant to purchase these as my only experience had been the Montmorency Cherries via Trader Joe's...as they both contained sugar, and the nearest TJ's is 5+ hours away...I decided to try this reasonably-priced item. I must say they are plump, tender, tart and absolutely delicious !! Tart cherries are known for their unique ability to relieve joint pain, which is why I eat them (in moderation). I also take a Tart Cherry Extract capsule supplement and can say, without doubt, the pain levels are lessened. These cherries are simply delicious and I will purchase again. Highly recommended !

review/text: These dried cherries are yummy, juicy, and chewy. They are plump, not dried out like your average raisin. I eat them from the bag or mix them into things like oatmeal or a salad. The only way I would stop buying these cherries is if they made an unsweetened version. Hint :-)

review/summary: Delicious and sweet, tart
review/text: I eat these now instead of candy.  They have the tartness of pie cherries but still are sweet and juicy even though dried.  They are chewy.  Loads of vitamin C in these and The People's Pharmacy says they will control gout and  high uric acid in the blood.<br />I don't know if that's true or not.  But as a sweet snack or candy alternative that's actually healthy these are perfect. Yummy and fresh tasting.

review/text: We first had these Montmorency cherries on a Christmas trip to Michigan. We liked them so much, we hunted them down when we got back home. We have ordered them twice, two bags at a time. The cherries are not too sweet, nor are they tart. They're great in oatmeal or cold cereal, in salads, or just straight up. We'll order them again.

review/text: I didn't even now what a Montmorency cherry was until I heard of these. They are basically a tart cherry that is a little lighter in color than the Bings. They have a perfect blend of sweet and tart that is just awesome. Great thing about these is that they are perfectly sweetened with a little bit of sugar. I will definitely be a regular buyer of these!

review/summary: Dull flavor, lifeless taste
review/text: I found two separate bags of these cherries to be dull and lifeless, with none of the zing I've found from other producers.  They were overly sweet in a way that seemed to mask the cherry flavor and had a texture that seemed almost cooked - mushy and gummy instead of chewy.<br /><br />I much preferred the Traverse Bay brand I purchased (here at Amazon) last year - that sample seemed fresher and less processed than these.

review/summary: Heaven in the Morning
review/text: I've been drinking International Coffee for 35 years now.  My elder sister drank Suisse Mocha when I went to her house, and the instant I hit adulthood, she offered me a cup. I really liked it, but later, my budget did not allow for it, so I tried making my own from a combination of cocoa mix and instant coffee.  What I got, was sick.  After that, I was done with Suisse Mocha, and considered buying other flavors my one little vice in life.<br /><br />Over the years, flavors I have liked--or not--have come and gone.  I loved the Kahlua flavor; it's been discontinued.  But every time I see a chance to load up on these hard-to-get coffees (at least where I live, in a major metropolitan city), I grab the best.  I think the Vanilla Bean Latte and the Vanilla Caramel are entirely scrumptious.  The directions give you an idea of how much to use; I judge by the size of the mug in my hand.  I don't mess with hot milk; this is all the coffee I'm drinking, and I am not awake enough to heat milk!  Hot water, just like instant coffee, and then, if I have it (so at home yes, at work no) I add a little milk and stir.<br /><br />I write this in the hope that the product will become more popular and therefore easier to find, but what may happen is that you folks out there will grab up the last few of my delicious brew.  Well, it's written now, and I guess I will publish it.<br /><br />Amazon, thanks for hooking me up with my hard-to-find coffee!

review/text: I had high hopes for this coconut oil.  What is not to love? Organic, Extra Virgin, decent price, subscribe and save, glass container???? but there in lies the problem, I was hoping from the image in the listing that this coconut oil was packaged in glass, but alas it arrived in a black plastic container, with the safety seal damaged nonetheless, so I had to send it back.  Oh well, I hope it is BPA free at least, but I couldn't see that indicated anywhere?  So, if you are looking at this listing hoping to get coconut oil in a glass container, look elsewhere.

review/text: Great stuff - interesting texture that starts out a bit more dense than petroleum jelly and then with not much heat, turns quickly to oil (that is, after pulling out a chunk with your finger, you have about 4 seconds to figure out what to do with it).<br /><br />Just be careful to store it below about 75 degrees F, as it will turn to a jar full of oil if you don't.  Cooling it back down should pull it back into its more manageable, firmer state.<br /><br />Smells amazing (if you like coconut)!

review/summary: Love the flavors
review/text: I am in love with the Rise Bar brand. My favorites are their breakfast bars, which have a chunkier and crispier consistency. The energy bars have more of a "Powerbar" like texture, everything is ground, with some shredded coconut added to some flavors for interest. Little bits of amaranth add some texture too, but they are still more soft and chewy than crunchy. That said, the energy bars taste pretty amazing too, and are a better alternative for strict vegans (sweetened with brown rice syrup and tapioca syrup instead of honey).<br /><br />To note, the Rise Energy Bars are very sweet, and almost dessert-like in my opinion. I enjoyed them most as a mid-day treat, particularly when I hit an afternoon lull before a workout. Plus, they are the perfect size for a sustainable energy snack.<br /><br />I love all of the "superfruit" inspired flavors, which are a fun change from the ordinary. That said, I think the blueberry and coconut is still my favorite - the flavors really stand out and are great together!

review/summary: My favorite energy bar
review/text: I've tried a bunch of different energy bars and this is my favorite. It's not as heavy as some, is quite satisfying, and is not too sweet. It is also organic, mostly raw (which I think is healthier), and doesn't have a ton of weird non-food ingredients. It's also fairly tidy to eat - I like the kind bars also, but they are very sweet and very messy. Generally I cut it in 1/2 - as I don't think I need all the calories at once, and use it as an in-between meal snack, or to help fill me up if I've only had a smoothie or salad for a meal. I used to be a big fan of the lara bars, but I prefer these. I've bought this flavor and the coconut flavor - and buy both in bulk on on subscribe and save.

review/summary: Spicy, but also a little too salty for my tastes
review/text: After looking for new spicy nuts on amazon, I came across these peanuts. Having heard good things about the Williamsburg Peanut Shop, I figured it was worth a blind buy and see how things go. When you taste the nuts, you first get a salty initial flavor, then immediately the jalapeno kicks in giving it that spicy taste. Not being a big salt fan, I wish there was less so the jalapeno flavor dominated more.<br /><br />The quality of the nuts they select are excellent, so if you're good with salt and spice, this might be good for you.

The brand I'd had were a similar price but the shipping was the same price as 3 cans of nuts! so I ordered this brand on amazon instead. Opened them and was sorely disappointed. They just tasted like regualr peanuts, with a tiny hint of spice, but certainly not a jalapeno flavor! contacted amazon and they were great about returning and refunding. I intend to shop around for better ones or even learn to season them myself
