review/summary: Surprisingly bland, as reflected by calorie count
review/text: If you've ever cooked chocolate too long you know the smell of burned chocolate.  It isn't a terribly bad odor, it's just not as pleasant as chocolate should be.  I tried this cereal twice and both times that burned chocolate smell started about 30 seconds into the cooking time.<br /><br />The oatmeal overall is not as sweet as I expected and other than the slight taste of burned chocolate, it is very bland, as in plain, unflavored, oatmeal.  Adding sweetener didn't help; it became just sweet but still flavorless.  I guess I expected a chocolate-chip-oatmeal-cookie flavor; unfortunately, this isn't.<br /><br />I am very glad I purchased only one box from my local grocery store rather than buying in bulk here, although it was the prior reviews of this flavor here which convinced me to try it in the first place.<br /><br />One interesting note: In spite of the chocolate chips, this flavor actually has fewer calories than other flavors of Quaker Instant Oatmeal.  It has only 130 calories per serving, while Cinnamon & Spice, Cinnamon Roll, and Maple & Brown Sugar (three of my favorites) all have 160 calories per serving.  Those extra 30 calories make a big difference to my taste buds, apparently.

review/summary: Large capers with Great Flavor !  Highly Recommended!!
review/text: When these capers arrived I did not expect the size or the flavor of these capers to be so outstanding. Chopped up and added to a dish that is caper friendly will be the 'bomb'.I created a tuna salad with capers,boiled eggs,diced tomatoes,dill pickles,celery,green or spanish onions and ranch dressing.The capers made the dish. Start with a teaspoon of chopped capers and go from there.Enjoy !

review/text: Ordered these after tiring of small,bland brined capers and was more than pleased with the product. Roared through my first jar making picatas and loxy bagels etc. Went back for the full liter jar. Will see how long that lasts. They will need a degree of soaking depending on their intended use. I'm bad about just grabbing a few from the jar and munching with a cold beer.

review/summary: Amazing product
review/text: I have tried numerous varieties of salted capers, but these by far are the best. In addition to the great flavor rendered by the salt, these capers are plump so you still get the feel and flavor of the fruit. Some may be put off by capers being salted, but I guarantee that after you try them, you'll never go back to the regular brined style. Try them in a putanesca, or my favorite, grilled shrimp with a puree of capers, garlic, olive oil and basil. Yum!

review/summary: Makes a solid white wine
review/text: I finished this wine kit about 4 weeks ago and like all other paklab products this creates a solid house wine to have around.  While I prefer their "Vino Italiano Moscato" kit-wine, this kit creates a very smooth, drinkable end result.<br /><br />There is a step during the creation process of these kits that requires you to "top-up" your carboy.  It's best to use the same kind of wine from a previous batch, however as this was the first time I made this wine the alternative was clean spring water.  I felt that I might've watered down this wine too much during this phase.  I have, however, used spring water at this point in several kits in the past and not had a watery taste at the beginning of one's sip.<br /><br />The goal, then, is to make another Pinot Grigio kit and use wine from the previous batch to avoid adding unnecessary water.  Of course by the time the second batch is made, rarely do I have excess wine to add to a kit.  This is due to the fact that these Paklab kits are SO drinkable, their end product seems to disappear so quickly.  The only reason I gave this wine a 3 instead of a 4 is because I prefer the Moscato from their Vino Italiano lines of kits, but that could be simply personal preference.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I had doubts about spending so much money on dog treats--but I have a toy poodle who has severe skin allergies triggered by just about every food type out there--so I have to be careful about what I feed him. On top of that, he's an extremely picky eater. He refuses just about every snack I give him. So I experimented by getting these. Not only do they not trigger his allergies whatsoever, but he absolutely loves these (he'll dance in circles to get a piece). The sticks are about the length of your hand and pretty narrow (width of a drinking straw). For my small dog, I break them into smaller pieces so they last longer. They're a little chewy, a little crisp--easy to eat and digest (or so it seems from watching my dog). And strangely enough, they smell good. Most dog treats make me want to gag from the smell--these smell like I could eat them. I get these regularly now.

review/summary: My Finicky Chihuahua Loves These
review/text: The usual routine with my 6 year-old teacup is this: Introduce something delicious, watch as she summarily dismisses it, pretend it doesn't matter as I sigh and walk away, spy her going in for a second perusal, watch as she reassesses her original assumptions, note her covetously going someplace private with her new find, silence a smug "told ya so" as she comes back looking for more.<br /><br />The process was a bit speedier as she moved through the steps when she first encountered these.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good about this product or this brand.<br /><br />I cook fresh for my dog (which yes: is more than likely totally responsible for her persnickety attitude towards food; she knows I'm a food writer so she holds me to a higher standard), and I generally taste everything that comes out of a package before introducing it to her. Thus, the packaged goods must be "people quality" and when the only things on a list of ingredients are meat and vegetables and vitamins and minerals, I'm totally down with trying them.<br /><br />I give her the Loving Pets Meat Sticks Duck & Sweet Potato recipe because I try to work more vegetables and carbs into her diet, and this is a great way to sneak some tuber in without her catching wise.<br /><br />I highly recommend these, and look forward to trying my princess out on other varieties now as well.

review/summary: Not too shabby!
review/text: Short and sweet review here.<br /><br />My 3 year old Doberman loves the treats. They are not too pricy.<br /><br />Only gripe is the amount of Glucosamine in each treat is rather low. (100 per treat)<br />I believe the standard is roughly 800-1500 per day depending on the size of your dog - and my dog isnt getting 15 of these treats in one day!<br /><br />But if you are in the market for a tasty treat for your dog that will add a little glucosamine to their diet, this is a good product. But just don't expect this to fulfill your dogs requirement with this alone.

review/summary: Not bad really
review/text: Its been about 50 days since I started this kit.  Like the other of this brand I bought, I was weary about the 6.1L juice bag.  I made changes to it and I would recommend others do the same, in which you do not make 6 gallons out of this and stop at 5 gallons.  I got about 23 bottles out of the kit because I wanted a "thicker" tasting wine.  Still the end result is a white wine that smells pretty good, looks a little on the clear side and tastes, to me anyway, kinda thin.  Now my wife and mother on the other had, like it very much.  I sweetend this back after stabilizing, back to a semi dry level.  The wine works well with a white fish and blander pork.  I like a lot of big bold flavors myself, so for me I won't be doing this kit again but if you are just starting out and you want an inexpensive product to start with, get this kit.  Its a nice "middle-of-the-road" wine that will please just about anyone.  So 3 out of 5 stars.

This kit makes a wine that is as close to the wines in Germany that you will find.If you have all of the basic wine making equipment,it is a breeze to make in just 5 or 6 weeks. We like it so well,we have put it on subscription with automatic delivery every 6 months,and at a 15% discount. Our only problem is not drinking it before it ages!

review/text: So I had never tried these, but I like the lavender Howards- and I love guava.  How to express the delightful island flavor of these little guys?  Imagine a smarty candy with a really intense, grown up, guava flavor (think pineapple, strawberry and pear- all mixed up together)- and them imagine that smarty is really large- that's this candy.  I like these.  My kids like these.  Their friends like these- but I told my kids they just can't share these with their friends- because they disappear too fast.<br /><br />You might want to know the ingredients:sugar, invert sugar, natural and artificial flavors, stearic acid, citric acid, malic acid, magnesium stearate, red 40 lake.  These little candies are made in the USA by the C. Howard company, 1007 Station Road, Bellport NY, 11713.<br /><br />Try these!  You won't be sorry- unless you don't like guava.  Then you might be.

I have had much hotter (Da' Bomb The Final Answer), but this will do if you don't like it that hot.  I would recommend this sauce on any Mexican food.

Also Capelin is actually red this is dyed black.<br /><br />ingredients list is as follows.<br />Capelin roes, salt, water, stabilizer (xanthan gum), spices, citric acid, sodium benzoate (0.1%) as preservative, FD&C Blue #1, Yellow #6, Red #40<br /><br />To test this product on a "caviar aficionado" i had one of my Russian friends try it and he said its "ok" but its very salty and tastes fishy. If you plan on using this as a topping for sushi then it would be fantastic.<br /><br />For the price its a good deal if you like salty briny fish.

review/summary: Wonderful Pop, Slightly Salty
review/text: This Capelin Caviar was really quite good--I ate it by itself and with some cream cheese and melba rounds--one of my favorite ways to eat caviar--and it mixed really well with the whipped cream cheese. I prefer cream cheese to creme fraiche, but I like both. The package was very carefully and thoughtfully packed, with ice packs and cushioning, so the product arrive in perfect condition. It came with a gorgeous little mother-of-pearl spoon, that, while fragile, is beautiful and will be something I look forward to using with guests. It was very pretty. I balked a bit at the shipping & handling price at first, but seeing the care they put into it and realizing it was packaged to keep the the caviar at the absolute best possible condition for shipping without excessive cost, it was worth it.<br /><br />If I had paid big bucks for this caviar, I might have been slightly disappointed--but only slightly--but at the price that is is, I'm totally impressed with the price vs. quality. It was just a 'touch' fishy smelling when I first opened it, but it was also not chilled (I had taken it from the packaging and couldn't wait to open it and see the quality until it chilled--and while it was shipped with ice packs, I live in Texas, and the packs were melted--BUT it wasn't burning hot/melting levels, which it very well could have been--it was just slightly warm) so it had a bit of a fishy smell to it, usually the sign of a poorer quality caviar. But after it chilled, there was no fishy smell to it at all. It was also quite salty--I realize anything with 620mg of sodium per serving is going to be salty, but there is overwhelming and then ordinary salty for caviar, and this one leaned to the 'saltier' side.<br /><br />All by itself, it's just a tad too salty for ordinary tastes. But mixed with the cream cheese or with the creme fraiche, it was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />It also has the nicest 'pop' to it, and that is my favorite part of caviar--that nice little pop to it. The color is quite deep, and it does stain a little, so you'll want to be careful with that. It's really quite gorgeous too, for decorating appetizers or amuse-bouche for guests. For me, I ate the entire jar in two sittings--it was really quite scrumptious. I ordered a smaller jar, because I wasn't sure of the quality, but now that I've ordered and am impressed, I will definitely be ordering a larger jar from them again in the future.<br /><br />If you're wanting a caviar for making a dish, for including in decoration for party platters or appetizers, this is a perfect cost-effective version to get. Definitely worth it. If you're wanting chilled caviar to be served all by itself and eaten straight, this works, but it's definitely obvious it's not as high of quality as some of the more expensive varieties. I did, however, eat it straight myself and enjoyed it--I just wouldn't necessarily use it for a party or dinner guests intended to eat it straight--but for recipes and appetizers, I think it's difficult to even tell the difference. Really good stuff.

review/summary: Superior taste!!!
review/text: I basically grew up eating fresh Caspian sturgeon and caviar, until it became scarce in 1980's.  Hence, I have first-hand knowledge of what the real stuff should look and taste like.<br /><br />This arrives neatly packaged in bubble/cardboard, in glass jars with metal lids, and label states it's a product of Island.  Shipping did not take long, only about 5 business days.<br /><br />The taste and smell is unbelievably the very same taste/smell of the real thing.  Texture is nice and pops, although quite a bit smaller than real stuff.  Overall, try the old Russian method of eating this:  Nice, firm slice of freshly baked white bread spread with butter - then thinly spread this caviar all over it.  This is the way we've always ate it, and the experience is unbeatable.  The worst thing you can do is put this on a dry, salty cracker.  Or, eat it in any other way for that matter.<br /><br />I ordered two jars at once and paid the same shipping, so it was $5 per jar.  I am planning to order a lot more, probably 5 jars at a time.  Supermarket sells real Osetra (sturgeon) caviar at $80 per 1.5 oz!!!!  American caviar at $45 for 3oz!!!  Come on guys, this is no rocket science - this stuff is the way to go.  From now on, I'm totally sold and a loyal customer!

review/summary: disappointing after the rave reviews
review/text: I'm a big fan of caviar, but this is one of the saltiest I have ever tasted.  It's quite a disappointment after all the favorable reviews -- like eating a spoon of tiny black salt tablets.  The price is reasonable, but it doesn't make up for the taste.  It's not as bad if you spread it thinly, but that shouldn't be the case.

review/text: This isn't a caviar for the caviar snob (as in, my mother spit it out) but I think that it tastes great for the price!  It's also much better than grocery store caviar, and the shipment arrived within 3 days of ordering!  The shipping speed was great, but I still think that $18 is incredibly overpriced for shipping costs.  Also, it DOES turn your poop green!  I wouldn't mention it if it hadn't already been mentioned a few times, but yes, like nuclear green.  Odd, to say the least.

review/text: I love caviar, but can only have it once in a great while because of the expense.  My brother gave me a jar of this Season's brand capelin caviar from the cold waters of Iceland... and it was fantastic.  Some of the best caviar I've ever had and I've had some pretty expensive caviar.  When I discovered the price!  Well, I won't have to do without caviar any more.  The eggs are very small, firm, black, and just the right amount of saltiness.  Delicious.  I highly recommend this brand for anyone who loves caviar and enjoys that clean snap of fresh roe.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDJZEM">Season Black Capelin Caviar from Iceland, 3.5-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 4)</a>

Not that there were a billion ingredients in the product, but from what I read about caviar, I was expecting "capelin roe and salt"...not spices, citric acid, sodium benzoate, and other food coloring. Otherwise, you get what you paid for...fish eggs, ang plenty off it for a low(er) price. Maybe I can save enough money to try any of the big three (sevruga, beluga, or osetra).

review/summary: Great steaks -- Horrible delivery
review/text: I ordered 12 steaks but only six arrived.  I contacted Omaha and they said they would send six more.  When the six more arrived they were completely thawed and now I am afraid to eat them  -- maybe I will fry them up and give them to my dog -- he has a strong stomach.  The six that arrived on time and still frozen were delicious. If this were baseball I would be thrilled, but I am not happy batting .500 in the steak department.<br /><br />Update:  Omaha sent me 12 more steaks.  They arrived still frozen and the two I have eaten were delicious.<br /><br />So all told, I originally ordered 12 -- only six arrived -- six more were sent but were thawed -- but then they sent 12 and they were great.  So in the end I ordered 12, but got 18 great steaks.  Omaha made it more than right.  Omaha may not be good at counting but they get an A for effort.

review/summary: Don't tell the DEA how habit forming these things are
review/text: Once you've navigated the challenge of removing the wrapper, you're in for a treat.  The dusting of confectioner's sugar or starch to keep the candy from sticking to the wrapper is only moderately successful, but this distraction pales once the candy goes in the mouth.<br /><br />Initially, the candy is moderately chewy, a little firmer than a caramel with a powerful honey flavor.  This really took me back when I checked and there was no honey in the ingredients.  As the candy warms and softens in your mouth, a monstrous ginger flavor rises out of the depths of the sweetness and kicks your sense of smell into submission and rips your eyelids open.  This is a great thing to experience.  At this point, the sweetness is taking the edge off the ginger flavor (barely), but not prevent the tears from coming to your eyes (of joy, I swear it).  And in a few moments it is done.<br /><br />And then, of its own accord, your hand begins to reach for another...<br /><br />A bag of twenty-four might last three days, if I really control myself.

review/summary: A Delicious Lifesaver
review/text: After researching for months on possible migraine headache relief, I discovered ginger was being used as a possible treatment. Having exhausted the "traditional" medical route without success, I jumped in with ginger and had great results. My neurologist has backed me up on this, and it is turning out to be an excellent treatment for me.<br /><br />I started with bulk crystalized ginger, then found these little chews at my local grocery store. Not only do they help alleviate my pain, but I have fallen completely in LOVE with them. I keep them with me at all times, as they are just great for my migraines, queasy stomach, or just to have something to chew on that isn't aspartame-ladden chewing gum (a major migraine trigger for many people).<br /><br />Ginger may not be for everyone, and it is a completely different heat than what you get with hot sauce or peppers. After a few months of eating them almost daily, I can get by without water, but for the first few weeks, I defintely needed a little heat-relief from a drink of water, as ginger can be very intense.<br /><br />All-in-all, these are delicious and have really helped change my quality of life. Defintely worth researching and asking your doctor about if you suffer from migraines!<br /><br />Have a great day.

Something to keep in my purse in case of emergency during a bumpy car ride or for after a greasy meal.<br /><br />I wasn't crazy about them at first, but they really do help with the nausea and are more pleasant than taking Pepto every time I get indigestion.  Needless to say, they began growing on me and now I eat them just because I like them.

The first time I ate one, I wasn't really sure I liked it; it is extremely strong in ginger flavor, almost to the point of overpowering. However, I tried another...and then another...and then another...yup, they are addictive. My brother told me stop buying them for him because he ate so many they actually made his stomach hurt. So, in moderation, these little ginger chews (which are, like the name says, chewy!) are fantastic! The  health benefit also makes them  that much better, as ginger is known for helping relieve stomach aches as well as being good for arthritis. I really prefer these chews over crystallized ginger which is a little too sweet for me.

review/summary: Way back in the day they were good, not so anymore...
review/text: I ate these a lot growing up.  My parents (and most people at the time in the 70s) didn't think about nutrition in foods for kids.  Now that I have 2 little ones, I read the ingredients.  The first ingredient is sugar.  It comes out to 3 teaspoons of sugar for a 1 ounce serving (serving size geared for adults).  A few ingredients (listed in order of quantity) is partially hydrogenated oil?!?!?!  This is the worst.  I wouldn't eat it myself let alone give it to children.  That kind of oil is highly processed and just 1 atom (chemically) away from being plastic.  This IS trans fat.  There is NO safe amount that anyone should consume of this stuff.  They get away with printing that it has no trans fat because it has less than .5 grams per serving (adult sized serving).  So there's like 8 grams of trans fat in a typical box.  I can see when you shop with kids you don't have time to read labels, but if you don't know for sure what's in something, take the time to go shopping alone so you can buy something that isn't total junk.<br /><br />On another soapbox, it's mostly us Americans that don't mind / care / desire a certain taste for stuff with trans fat.  For example, when I was in Korea for a year for the service, the korean oreo cookies had no trans fat at all and were just as good as the US version that had 1.5 g of trans fat per serving.

Ad said (2 Pack) Each package contains four mixes so I assumed a total of 8 mixes-I received 2 mixes. That is almost $8.00 per loaf with shipping. After talking to Prepared Pantry they said I would receive full credit, received $4.00. I can purchase bread mixes for less than $2.00 here in Ohio Amish county that are just as good. Oh Well

review/text: I must say that I have never been a red velvet type of gal, and after my daughter and I were diagnosed with Celiac disease, I quit almost all sweets. I found this mix at a local store and decided to try it, because I was starting to crave sweets. Well, I LOVE THESE CUPCAKES!!!!! They are so moist and yummy!! I just can't even put into words how great they are! SO, I bought the rest of Heartland Gourmet's mixes, and so far the lemon cupcakes and the carrot cake(never liked carrot cake until this!!) are just as wonderful!! I can't believe these things are sooooo yummy!!

review/text: This was the first egg replacer I used after I found out that my toddler was allergic to eggs.  I have made everything from banana bread to pancakes and casseroles with it and everything has turned out perfectly...until this winter.  Suddenly everything I made with the replacer tasted terrible to me, even when I opened a new package and threw out the old.  I am not sure what the shelf life of this product is, but mine seemed to go bad within 6 months of purchase.  I easily went through one package in that time, but there is no way I could have gotten through four packages!  I would recommend this product, but only if you do enough eggless baking to get through all four packages within six months.

review/summary: Works well to replace egg in recipes
review/text: I do a lot of baking and, since my husband doesn't eat egg, I've tried a bunch of substitutes. This is the best option I've tried so far. It goes well in cakes, tastes fine, and only makes them a bit denser. I just use an electric mixer a bit longer than usual and they rise almost as well as cakes with egg. The results vary by type of baked good, but it's never failed completely. Other than cakes, I haven't really noticed any difference when using this instead of egg. Pancakes were perfect. There is a bit of a soy flavor, but it hasn't made much of a difference to my family.

review/text: Just as a heads up to fellow Celiacs,I bought this product thinking it was the 'egg replacer' often referred to in gluten-free bread recipes. Sadly this product has wheat gluten as an ingrediant, so once again I'm in search of an online vendor for the GF egg replacer since Amazon has not had it in stock for months now.  This product works fine, thus the 3 stars, its just not what I had been looking for. I wish it had a different name to avoid confusion (egg substitute?)

review/summary: CAREFUL ABOUT INGREDIENTS IN THIS PRODUCT
review/text: I was looking for an egg powder to use in protein shakes and stumbled across this. Upon examining the ingredients, I realized this product was not for me--nor probably many others. This product contains soy, which, in the last 20 years, has been added to virtually everything because it is a cheap filler. At one time, we were told soy had a long list of wonderful benefits and people were gobbling up soy milk and everything else soy they could get their hands on thinking it was a real health benefit.<br /><br />However, the tide has turned and the medical community now realizes that all this excess soy (which soy contains ALOT of phytoestrogens!) is not good for everyone. Estrogens increase many kinds of cancers and if you are overweight, body fat produces and stores excess estrogen on its own, so this is only adding to the problem for both men and women. Perimenopausal women also often suffer from estrogen dominance (you know if you have fibroids) and, therefore, make soy a poor choice.<br /><br />Some people believe phytoestrogens can "balance out" cyclic changes of low and high estrogens, but this has not been proven (while the effects of too much soy has) and for me, I'd rather err on the side of caution. Especially considering there is hidden soy in almost everything we buy prepackaged, as well as naturally occurring phytoestrogens from other plant sources.<br /><br />While I love Bob's Red Mill products, basically soy anything should only be consumed in small doses and using products like this regularly should be carefully considered.

review/summary: Gluten-free!
review/text: Looking for a cheaper gluten-free flour?  Look no further.  They don't mill wheat, so it's gluten-free with no chance of cross-contamination--unlike virtually every other brand of corn flour out there, except Publix, which is only available in four U.S. states.<br /><br />However, this is masa harina, not corn flour, so you can make tortillas, arepas, tamales and skillet corn bread with it...and not much else.<br /><br />Edit:  Masa Harina Socca<br /><br />(With many thanks to Mark Bittman.)  One and 1/2 cup water to one cup masa harina--let sit for several hours, covered.  Preheat oven to 450.  Find a flat cast-iron skillet without sides--like a flat fajita grill.  (A regular cast iron pan with sides will concentrate the heat too much on the edges and burn the edges before the center gets cooked.)<br /><br />Pour enough canola oil into the pan that it sloshes a little. Spoon the dough into the pan.  Finally, put the pan into the preheated oven. Leave for an hour to an hour and a half.  Flip halfway through.  L'Chaim.

It can be used to make masa harina (dough) for "tortillas, sopes and empanadas, enchiladas, pupusas, guaraches, arepas and atole," the manufacturer says. It is gluten free.<br /><br />The manufacturer (the Gruma) company has been making this fine corn flour for over 50 years.

I have no idea. But my friends and I, many of whom come from all over the Americas, have been getting together to make arepas for brunch on the weekends for years. We've all arrived at the same conclusion, so we used to buy Maseca but now we really only use PAN. The masa it makes isn't as gritty as with Maseca, so you get a soft smooth wonderful warm inner layer but can still get a nice crisp outer shell.... soooo so good.

review/summary: Good tortillas but very delicate
review/text: Followed the instructions for homemade corn tortillas and they were better than the store versions, but extremely fragile. Be sure to add enough salt, and let the dough rest for about 10-15 minutes before forming tortillas. I used plastic wrap and a rolling pin and had no problem making very thin tortillas. Used a heavy Calphalon non-stick egg pan as a substitute for a comal. No oil required and it gave me a chance to practice my flipping skills.<br /><br />This masa flour is for corn tortillas, but it's such a big bag of flour that we also made tamales. Note that there is a special flour for tamales that is a bit more coarse. The tamales turn out well, but perhaps a touch more gummy than if we had used the tamale flour. We didn't have corn husks, so we used tin foil to wrap each tamale and steamed in a vegetable steamer for one hour.<br /><br />After you try homemade tortillas you'll never buy the store brands again.

review/text: I've used this almond flour with the Almond Flour cookbook, and all of my recipes come out great! I've used it for biscuits and muffins. The biscuits did come out tasting more like cornbread, but that may have been the way the recipe was written, not the flour. My muffins have been perfect though. I will be buying more!

review/summary: taste like moth balls
review/text: I was so excited to get it because I am on a diet and I knew wha cht it taste like and was waiting to make some cheesecake. I opened it and it smelled like moth balls. I decided it just might be the outside that smelled. When I took a bit of my cheesecake all I could taste was moth balls. It ruined the whole cake. Wont by from this company again.

review/summary: Not so good, not too bad.
review/text: Tasty Bite has become my least favorite brand of shelf-stable retort-packaged Indian meals. I saw this particular offering, Peas Paneer, at the 99 cents store so I decided to give it a try, anyway. It is not the worst of their line but it is certainly not the best, either.<br /><br />The thin sauce is fairly nondescript despite the spiciness. The paneer (spongy fresh cheese) is decent and has thoroughly absorbed the sauce. What I sincerely dislike is that the peas are mushy like generic canned peas, which may be unavoidable, but unpleasant nonetheless.<br /><br />Adding some diced cooked potato bulks up this meal and makes the solid-to-liquid ratio more favorable. I also like to add some lightly microwaved frozen peas and serve with brown rice and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1JFY">MTR Mixed VegetablePickle, 10.56-Ounce Plastic Bottles (Pack of 8)</a>.<br /><br />The entire package is supposed to be two servings but is realistically one. The total contents have 700mg of sodium, 12g of dietary fiber, 20g of fat, and 9g of saturated fat. The meal is obviously not vegan since it contains cheese but it is vegetarian and is certified dairy kosher.

review/summary: Works to GOOD
review/text: Flour is light and fluffy just need to make adjustments for recipes because of the difference between all purpose and White Lilly even on the recipes printed on bag. It also could be the difference in location from the South and Cali. Overall I would purchase gain but having to buy so much really is a drag.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: These are shipped cold and must be kept in the fridge. Great quality. Smell amazing. Sage has so many benefits:<br /><br />"Sage Tea Benefits:<br /><br />Sage tea is beneficial in coping with stress. It is astringent, sedative and expels gas; it clears the respiratory tract, makes a good gargle for sore throats and helps overcome colds.<br />...<br />Sage is useful for night sweats as it reduces sweating. It also reduces milk flow in nursing mothers prior to weaning, prevents the formation of kidney stones by dissolving residues of uric acid, and regularizes menstruation. An infusion of sage can be applied to the scalp to reduce dandruff."<br /><br />Plus recommended in aiding in weight loss as it boosts metobolism (I saw this on Dr. Oz.)<br /><br />I am so pleased to find organic tea. Also this tea is grown in the USA so that is another plus. And the containers they come in are so cute, I will be reusing them when they are empty.

review/summary: I didn't love it
review/text: I purchased a couple of these Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers from my local Big Lots for about two dollars each.  The concept is nice.  If you like pasta, then these little containers have a single serving size of pasta. Pasta doesn't fill me up so I had to pair this with a cup of cherry tomatoes and a side salad to really feel like I was full.  Flavor wise, it is fine.  The sauce was lackluster and could have used some more spices.  Adding pepper helped.  Making the dish was easy enough.  You fill the bowl up to the fill line with water and the top functions like a colander for draining the water.  Then you mix in the sauce.  The amount of packaging used in the creation of this product is bad.  There are no recycling number to indicate the type of plastic used.  Typically #1 and #2 plastics are easily recyclable whereas something like a #5 is not.  The colander lid seems to be a #5 to me.  For those wanting to save money, I might recommend purchasing a microwave pasta cooker that is reusable.  Consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YT2XOI">Fasta Pasta The Microwave Cooker</a>.

review/summary: Best Tonic Water I Ever Tasted
review/text: I love this stuff!  I drink premium Vodka tonics, so for Christmas in 2009 my husband got me the tonic sample kit sold here.  I tried every one.  My favorite by far is the Q tonic.  It is clean, a little citrusy, and I love the fact that it uses organic Agave sweetener for a healthier, lower-calorie drink.
