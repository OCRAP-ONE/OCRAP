review/summary: Good with coffee
review/text: These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.

Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly broken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad.

review/summary: Great for Fibromyalgia and mental fatigue with NO nervous jitters
review/text: I have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue.  I have learned over the past 30 years that amino acids and vitamin B help reduce my fibromyalgia and also help with my mental fatigue.  The physical fatigue is still there but that is something I just have to pace myself with.  This "Energy Shot" is NOT loaded with caffeine and uppers.  This is just plain old vitamins in liquid form which allows my body to absorb them faster.  I still take my Royal Jelly Softgels, but the Red Rain at breakfast helps me start the day.  I drink it when I get up and go about getting ready for the day.  I don't ever get a burst of energy but it just lifts my metabolic system enough to be somewhat productive in a day and keeps my muscles from being so sore.

review/text: My daughter loves this chocolate milk, and always asks for it when we go to the coffee shop.  I thought of buying it in bulk for car trips, but decided to read the ingredient list first.  I'm not a super health-nut, but there are a handful of harmful ingredients that I look for on nutrition labels and one of them is carrageenan. It is a know carcinogen and hides in a lot of "health" foods. This chocolate milk contains carrageenan. Needless to say, I will not be buying it.

Don't pay anything above $15 with free ship in my opinion.  I mean seriously, more than $1 a piece is outrageous, it isn't worth it.  Buy it by the gallon at your local stores.<br /><br />**Also, just read a news article saying Dean Foods (mfg or Horizon) has become the milk mafia in squeezing out the local farmers and any competition.  It makes me not want to even buy this product.  Think carefully before you purchase and read up on all articles about Dean Foods.  Very interesting.

review/summary: great
review/text: Since I've started buying groceries at amazon I have discovered "taste great" is a pretty subjective thing.  That's obvious since everyone has different tastes, but even so I wonder about some of the great reviews on some things.  So I bought this because it was on sale with the 20 dollars off deal and didn't actually expect to enjoy the milk.  I bought the regular milk and this chocolate.  Well, I'm pleasantly surprised to say it actually does taste great.  The milk does have a very very slight different taste from milk you would get in your supermarket, but in no way does that take away from the milk.  I drunk it when it was over room temp and then when it was cool.  It tasted better cold, but it wasn't bad warmer either.  So I guess Horizon can consider me a convert to their milk and I will certainly buy again before the sale is off.

review/text: I bought a case, not yet knowing that while it qualifies as organic technically, the company does nothing to go above and beyond like many organic companies do. I bought it because the prices were so much better than Organic Valley.<br />My soy allergic son had an allergic reaction to one sip.<br />I called the company, and they do run soy on the same line.<br />I drank the rest of the case myself over time and only buy Organic Valley for my kids. Not only do I not want another soy reaction, but Organic Valley actually makes it a rule to treat their cows with respect and gives them a good life in addition to following the organic standards. Horizon does whatever they can to be right on the margin so they can charge organic prices.<br />Still better than conventional? Maybe. But even without allergies, I like my milk to contain just milk, not traces of something else.

review/summary: It contains carrageenan
review/text: This milk contains carrageenan. Carrageenan is a type of sugar which is found in seaweeds, and generally used to make the milk thicker and creamer. Although it is largely used in food, there are growing concerns about its safety (see: [...] and the body of scientific work published by Dr. Joanne K. Tobacman)<br /><br />There is a big dispute going on about carrageenan's safety. However, for me, it suffices to say that carrageenan is "the" drug of choice to induce inflammation on mice ears, whenever scientists want to test for anti-inflammatory agents.<br /><br />The fact that it can induce such a powerful inflammation process, plus all the recent scientific work showing evidences that long term use of carrageenan is harmful to our gastrointestinal system , are enough for me to avoid using it myself. Imagine then, using it on my children!!!<br /><br />I wrote to Organic Horizons asking why they used carrageenan on their milk for children, and I got an answer saying that "silk soy milk" was safe, and bla, bla, bla. Apparently, their customer service representative didn't even bother to replace the "silk soy milk" for "chocolate milk". They probably receive so many of these inquires that they don't even bother to personalize the answers any more.<br /><br />Well, I am not buying this product anymore and decided to post this review because I think more people should know about carrageenan and decided for themselves, whether they want to consume it or not. I believe carrageenan shouldn't be used in food anymore. Especially on those claiming to be organic and targeting our CHILDREN. I am switching to Organic Valley.

You can find them for a $1 each at local grocery stores and often Babies R Us will have the 18-pack for sale. I just bought an 18-pack for $14 from BRU a month ago.<br /><br />So I recommend Amazon lower their price - I love Amazon, but overcharging is just wrong!

review/text: I bought a 3 pack of these because of the reviews and I thought.....blah.... the organic milk is kind of watered down and bland plus where's the chocolate milk flavor? For being high in calories and sugar (180 cal. 27 G of sugar) I was expecting some major chocolate flavor but not so. My suggestion is to buy a smaller pack before you buy in bulk to see if you will like it. I wanted to like them but I didn't.

review/summary: We love this milk!!!
review/text: We love Horizon organic milk (and pretty much all their products)!  My kids love all flavors of this milk, including the regular ol' white milk.  They tell me they know when they are not drinking Horizon milk by the taste, like at school.  Due to the higher sugar content in the flavored milks (vanilla, strawberry and chocolate), I usually water down these flavors with white milk a litte in their cups at home.  They don't seem to care either way and drink all their milk at meals without being nagged.  We love the convenience of being able to toss these packages in the cooler too for road trips or take a stock pile without keeping in a cooler for longer trips.<br /><br />A few important tips, make sure you shake well before opening and serving; and if you want to keep the milk for being squeezed out when little hands are holding, raise the flaps on either side of the package before poking the straw through the top and handing over to the child.  I learned this from a pre-school teacher with juice boxes and it works well for these milk packages also.

review/text: I really am glad that I stumbled on the $10 off promo and tried these chocolate milk cartons.  The kids like them better than juice, and I do too!  Even putting 100% juice in the lunches is not as good as these.  With the school lunch periods getting shorter & shorter, I want to be sure that the kids get nutritionally dense foods - not just a short term sugar rush.  These help immensely.  I really recommend the product, and will continue to purchase it.

review/summary: Not to shabby
review/text: My husband and I have a terrible habit of letting milk go bad so we don't buy it anymore unless we need it for something specific in the next 24 hours.  As a result, we often end up with boxes of cereal we can't eat and Mac & Cheese we can't make.<br /><br />We tried buying the powdered milk, but could never get the consistency right for drinking so we only use it for baking.  My husband likes Silk soy milk, but I've never been a huge fan.  On a whim, I typed "Milk" into the Amazon search and this product popped up in several varieties.  I had never heard of milk that didn't need to be refrigerated and had a shelf life of a year.  I had to try it.<br /><br />I bought the white milk and the chocolate milk, that comes in handy for those midnight chocolate cravings!  The chocolate milk is pretty tasty.  It doesn't taste exactly like the Nestle or Oak Farms chocolate milk I'm used to.  It doesn't seem as rich, but it was an easily acclimated taste.  I've used the white milk on Frosted Flakes and to make Kraft Mac & Cheese so far with great results.  The mac & cheese had a nice tang to it.<br /><br />If you are used to drinking Organic, Reduced Fat Milk, this product will probably taste no different to you.  If you don't usually drink this type of product, there is a slight taste variation, but is quickly overlooked.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive buying milk this way, but if you are anything like we are, the added expense is worth it for the convenience of always having unspoiled milk available and being able to grab one on the go.  We've probably thrown away hundreds of dollars of spoiled milk over the years.<br /><br />We also buy the single serving cereal bowls and these milks are the perfect size to fill the bowl at the office.<br /><br />[...]

review/text: My youngest daughter will only drink chocolate milk.  Even then, she doesn't drink much.  These are perfect because of the small amount, the ability to store in the pantry instead of the refrigerator and the organic part makes me happy (no bovine growth hormones or lactation hormones to increase the milk production.<br /><br />I am lactose intolerant but once a week I brave the side effects to drink a box (it is that good!)<br /><br />Consider the auto-ship program to get a discount on the price.<br /><br />Although a bit pricey it winds up being less expensive because there is no waste due to spoilage (no science projects in the fridge.<br /><br />We have started buying the Horizon brand white milk as well.  In addition to the healthy aspects of the organic milk it tastes better too.  My wife was concerned that we were spending a lot more for organic milk and she did not think we could tell the difference.  We did a blind taste test, and both my daughter and myself identified the Horizon brand five times out of six as the milk we liked better (the sixth time she tried to fool us by giving us the same milk in both glasses!<br /><br />You will save space, save money, and drink more of a healthier milk

review/text: There are little things in life that while more expensive that they 'should be,' are worth every penny from a satisfaction standpoint. For my wife, these little chocolate milks from Horizon fall into that category. At about a dollar a pop, they're not really a good economic value vs. a carton of milk. However, they are exactly the right size for a snack, don't have to be refrigerated, and of course taste fantastic--all things that she values immensely. So I buy them for her and it makes her happy and because she is happy I am happy. That's worth every penny!

I like to send this milk with my older daughter for her lunch because it does not need to be refrigerated. I include a standard straw because the small straw can colapse into the container. (The small straw is useful for poking the hole for the regular straw.) I found the monthly service on Amazon to be the best deal for a pack of 18.

review/summary: OH HOW I WISH I HAD TRIED THIS MILK SOONER!!!!
review/text: A co-worker has tried many times to get me to use organic milk.  Due to a severe illness as an infant I was taken off dairy products (doctor's orders) at 6 1/2 months and according to family I refused to drink milk again.  I use milk in cooking and try to eat cereal and oatmeal with milk to get my calcium but couldn't use 1/2 gallon before it ruined and I really hate to waste food.<br /><br />I began reading about shelf stable milk and liked the idea IF and only IF it tasted like real milk.  I searched Amazon and debated several days before trying Horizon Chocolate Milk.  Chocolate Milk is the only milk I will drink and again I can't drink 1/2 gallon or even a quart before it ruins, although I try.  When I saw the additional discount offered I decided if ever I was going to try it, now is the time.  IF it tastes like real milk and can be stored without refrigeration until ready to use it would be a win win situation for me.  Well......<br /><br />UPS brought my milk today and not only did I try it, I asked my teen-age son who LOVES milk to give it a try.  He couldn't believe it when I told him UPS delivered it from Amazon and that it didn't have to be stored in a refrigerator until it was opened.  As for me....I LOVE IT and can't believe I waited this long to try it.  It tastes better than the chocolate milk I purchase at the store.  As far as price-I can't give an accurate price comparison as this milk is not sold locally in my small hometown.  I've seen other posts mentioning price and I think the 15 I paid for it to be delivered to my door is an excellent price.  I can already appreciate the convenience of having the 8 oz containers that I can toss in my office refrigerator, a lunch box or just grab on the way out the door as a quick breakfast.  Being able to open only what I plan to drink is just way better than I can describe. I would give it more than 5 stars if possible.<br /><br />Great milk (organic), delivered to your door, stored without refrigeration-I couldn't ask for more.

review/text: I always purchase this milk for my son's lunch - he loves it, but how can you really go wrong with chocolate milk?!  My only complaint is that this product is horribly overpriced on Amazon.  I purchase the exact same product (18 count) for under $12 at Costco.  Plus if you factor in shipping cost -- yikes, you could easily spend $3 for each little box. Before you do that, I would suggest buying organic milk at the grocery and adding a dollop of Hershey's syrup.

review/text: I love Horizon Organic products and accidentally stumbled across these in Starbucks.  I had a $5 gift card and instead of leaving a just little on it, I purchased a Horizon Organic Chocolate milk along with my coffee.  I thought "I better go straight home so I can put this in the fridge for later"  WRONG!  I was so happy that they don't have to be refrigerated!  Then, I was even happier when I tasted it--- soooo good!  Now when I have a chocolate craving after dinner, I reach for one of these instead of a candy bar. Yes, they're still 180 calories, but I feel better about having one of these than candy, cookies, or ice cream.  They are a bit expensive, but with Amazon's current sale, and shopping around locally, I've found them for an ok price.  I also emailed Horizon Organic and they're sending me 3 coupons.  (I don't know for how much off)

review/text: I love these milks.  They are UHT processed, an "ultra high temperature" process mainly used in Europe.  In fact, in France, it is hard to find any milk which isn't UHT.  UHT allows the milk to be stored for a long time without refrigeration.  How great is that?  It's wonderful.  It has a slightly different taste, but you get used to it in about two days.  My kids love this milk, and I buy it in all flavors.  They drink at least two a day.  So if you can't get your kids to drink  milk, try this.  It is delicious, smooth, not gloppy and thick like American grocery story milk (that stuff is repulsive).

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: My grocery store was selling singles of these so I grabbed one to try and was pleasantly surprised. It has a nice, chocolatey flavor and smooth texture without being too sweet. A major problem I have with other chocolate milks is either your can't taste the milk-y-ness, or it's so chocolatey it's weird, or it's SO thick you kind of wonder what they used to make it. The portion sizes are pretty weird too, I'm not a calorie counter but a couple months ago I glanced at the side of a chocolate milk drink to discover the whole bottle had over 500 calories! Because of this I don't by "pre-made" chocolate milk and I'll just use powdered mix or syrup to make my own at home where I can control the quantity and the flavor.<br /><br />I really just bought this on a whim, not because it's "healthy" or "organic". I liked it so much I went back and bought an 18 count case. At my grocery store it was on sale for 14.99 but the regular price is 18 something. It's a little pricey but it's delicious and I don't have to worry about using it up too quickly because of the long-life packaging. It's totally great for throwing in my lunch or for a quick snack. The amount of milk is just right.<br /><br />I am also the type where drinking too much milk can kind of give me a belly ache, but this is just the right amount where it doesn't bother me, or maybe the organic nature has something to do with it? I don't know but it's definitely a positive!

review/text: As I have said in other reviews, I enjoy eating healthier yet have little time to eat at work. I have been trying to move myself away from fattier, oily snacks during my day and sugary sweet drinks to wash them down. I thought Sun-Chips were pretty good, and buying chocolate milk from the Cafeteria filled it in. I wanted to do better, though. I have now been drinking a lot of Vita Coco to help fill the void, but it can be so expensive and sources which are decently-priced are endangered. This was a questionable purchase at first, since I have been drinking skim milk for 15 years now, so I am used to and prefer the cold, crisp, lighter flavor. I am glad I went for it!<br />Pros<br />-Love the packaging! Does seem to keep flavor better than traditional small milk cartons.<br />-Smooth and rich flavoring. Chocolate is richer in flavor than vanilla. My wife says the vanilla has an after-taste, but I disagree. So it is apparently subjective. I have yet to try the strawberry, but if I were a betting man, I would say the same is true for it.<br />-Better sugar and fat contents than generic milk packages. I have read other reviews that criticize this, but I am not sure what they have been drinking instead. All regular milk has sugar. It is really not that much.<br /><br />Cons<br />-You might be of those who think the sugar content is too high.<br />- The flavor is different than any I had had before. Any new flavor can be a tough adjustment. Sometimes, that adjustment never completes (I think this one is worth it, but I adjusted very quickly).

It is also extremely portable and i can store them anywhere, not just the fridge. I would sometimes treat myself one after workout as well and they taste great!<br /><br />Although it is a bit pricey, but considering the fact that they last for a long time and they are organic and individually packed, it is totally worth it when it saves you space, money and gives you health! AND the auto ship program offers a great price too.

review/summary: Great taste
review/text: I like the taste of this chocolate milk.  It's not too sweet and the size is perfect to take to work and have it as my breakfast.<br /><br />--new<br />The design of this container is terrible for toddlers.  Opening from the top fits the straw perfectly but this is bad.  When my daughter drinks it she would try really hard to suck on the straw. When the air is gone and container is flat she would squeese it trying to get more milk.

review/text: I buy this on Amazon when it's on sale for my 2 nieces - they love it. One likes the Vanilla more and the other likes this chocolate more. It's very practical - it doesn't have to be refrigerated until opened, doesn't expire as fast as regular milk, it has a lot of vitamins and calcium, it's organic, low fat and sweet. It has a nice light chocolate flavor. I usually keep a few in the fridge for myself as well.

review/summary: Yumm milk that travels well
review/text: This is a great product because you have the option of serving it cold, but if you eat bagged lunch and take these with you, you mustn't worry about the milk going bad for being left out, as it requires no refrigeration.<br /><br />The taste is noticeably rich and has a great consistency.  It is all organic and made with pure cane sugar (no artificial anything!).  The package is very conveniently portable and insulates fairly well, and it comes with a straw on the outside which is convertible.<br /><br />The reason it loses a star, however, is that said straw no longer slurps very well after the milk gets down to a certain point, so eventually, you need to start tilting the package forward with your mouth attached to its top!

review/summary: Organic?!? But with CARRAGEENAN?!?
review/text: Besides the shelf life - which IMO organic products shouldn't have too much of - this milk contains Carrageenan - a probable carcinogen!!! Since Amazon doesn't show all ingredients, I had to look them up at the store, and I was shocked when I saw Carrageenan as one of them on this milk!! CARRAGEENAN: a seaweed derivative used in a wide variety of foods and cosmetics. In its native form, it has not been classified as a carcinogen, but in it's degraded or broken down form it has been classified as a possible human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Joanne Tobacman, M.D., University of Iowa assistant professor of clinical internal medicine, and researcher on carrageenan, said "There seems to be enough evidence associating carrageenan with significant gastrointestinal lesions, including malignancies, to avoid ingesting it." According to Dr. Tobacman, the native carrageenan, after being subjected to stomach acids may be broken down into the degraded form and be a cancer risk. And even if it wasn't, carrageenan cannot be identified as native or degraded on food labels, so there is no way of knowing if you are ingesting carrageenan, the carcinogen or not.

review/text: I'm a huge fan of VitaCoco because their basic coconut water is fresh, tasty, not from concentrate and a much more natural gym drink than Gatorade.  I also am a huge fan of buying VitaCoco over Amazon because it's a whole lot cheaper than GNC or the random delis that sell their products.  And I'm a big fan of Rihanna's music.  Sadly, I am *not* a fan of this Rihanna-inspired flavor.  The sugar (evaporated cane juice) seems unnecessary and counter to the health marketing... just user riper fruit!  Also, I'm not a fan of dragonfruit since its actually a very bland, watery fruit despite the cool name and appearance.  If you want tropical then stick with their Pineapple, Tangerine or Passionfruit flavors!

review/summary: Extremely nasty. Cannot drink.
review/text: When I bought this, there were no ingredients to be found. Not here. Not on the maker's lame web site.  From what I could tell by the photo, it looks like coconut water, pineapple, orange and watermelon... and that sounded really good.<br /><br />I actually complained to the company that there was no information, and they added the content to this page.  As you will see, it now says "coconut water, pink guava, oranges, red dragon fruit, and pineapple"... and gross.<br /><br />I don't know where the pink guava and whatever the frig red dragon fruit is on the photo, but apparently what I thought was a watermelon is one of the two.  I have also tasted the plain coconut water, and the only good thing about that is that it is a base to add with something else.  The only combination that works and is tolerable to drink is the coconut and pineapple combo.  And even after a couple of those, you don't really enjoy it.  But this tropical fruit case is still in my fridge.  I tried 4 different times, and each time I have had to dump it.<br /><br />... and Rihanna is certainly not a selling plus for me. I can't tolerate her either.

review/text: I really feel it is not the flavor that is causing the problem; it tastes rotten so I'm wondering if the packager let some part of the juice sit out too long.  I haven't had a problem with VitaCoco products prior to this so I really think that is what happened.  I am also concerned because these comments have not been addressed by the company.  In my opinion, these should be recalled.

review/text: Very refreshing. Plenty of fruity flavor. Thicker.... not water like consistency. Good chilled or not. Slightly sweet, milky and tart. I like the products I have tried from this company.

review/summary: Tropical fruit taste makes it
review/text: Two good things about this drink come to mind, when compared to other similar products. The 17-0z container has a screw top that is so much better than the foil strip on the 11-oz one. Also the tropical fruit flavor is much better than the acai-pomegrante flavor of the 11-oz variety. Coco water has a unique taste that for me, at least needs to be masked, even though I like the best concept that coco water is better hydration than plain water or the store energy drinks.
