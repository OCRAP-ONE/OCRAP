review/summary: Okay but needs some variety and less coconut!
review/text: - This granola is okay; not great, not awful.<br />- The texture is nice.<br />- A bit too sweet for my taste, almost sickeningly so.<br />- The paper thin almond slivers are used quite sparingly.<br />- The prevalent taste is coconut.<br />- It gets rather boring after a while since there is not enough variance in ingredients to make each bite a bit different (as with a fruit & nut granola, for example, where each bite may have a different type of fruit and/or nut to give it some variety) so every bite is exactly like the previous one.<br />- I mixed it with some Bear Naked F&N which improved it

review/summary: This granola is wonderful
review/text: Compared to some other granolas out there it has a nice golden color and wonderful nutty crunchy taste.  Since I am trying to cut back on the sugar I compensate by not having as much but I just have to have some sprinkled on my plain oatmeal or a couple teaspoons added to my muesli.  It's great in yogurt, milk, soy milk or just crunching a small handfull by itself for a small sweet snack.

review/summary: Bakeries in Colorado take notice
review/text: It's one of the big things I miss most about New York, since having moved to Colorado in April of 2007 - Bakeries. And specifically a really good Coffee Cake. Unless you are living in the heart of Denver there are just no real bakeries to be found. King Soopers and Safeway do try but then I just don't think they really know just how good a good coffee cake should be.<br /><br />Grandma's definitely fills that void for us. This is just a scrumptious coffee cake.<br /><br />I have ordered this in the past from QVC but have found the quality of it different by ordering this from Amazon. The two times I ordered it from QVC - the cake and the sample cakes were wet and mushy and nearly inedible. From Amazon it was moist - as it should be - but not wet and well - simply delicious.<br /><br />I will definitely be purchasing this again, although I wish that the shipping charges were less expensive. I get my head around it by defining it as a treat that anyone hankering for a good coffee cake should allow themselves the luxury of having at least once and a while.

review/summary: Healthy treat for my corn-allergic son
review/text: Having an allergy to corn and being super sensitive to artificial colors,flavors and preservatives, my 8-yo son has a limited selection when it comes to treats.  Almost everything at bakeries uses mixes that contain these ingredients, even at the Wegman's bakery.  But one day I discovered Grandma's of New England coffee cakes at Wegmans.  I did not want to pay $10 for a coffee cake, especially one that comes in a box, but I was desperate for something healthy.<br /><br />When I served this to my family, I was expecting it to be hard, dry and taste like playdough.  Boy, was I wrong! It is soo moist, the texture is soft and perfect. It was full on natural, delicious flavor without any odd aftertaste. It was gone in a day.  That was the apple, which I bought several times since.  This weekend, I found the cinnamon walnut in Wegmans and I like it just as much.<br /><br />I looked up Grandma's website and was shocked to find it cost twice as much there, and here as well.  I hope Wegman's will be carry more flavors in the future.

review/summary: Taste is off, my grandma agrees!
review/text: There is something off tasting about my grandma's coffee cake. i've had it twice now and the last time with my own grandma believe it or not. She agreed with me about the taste. Her favorite coffee cake is Fantasicakes coffee cake or Boston coffee cake (you can get both on amazon). I agree totally. I had never heard of Fantasicakes until my grandma mentioned it months ago. So I looked them up on Amazon and ordered me a cinnamon walnut coffee cake from Fantasicakes...one word: AMAZING. One of my motivations of ordering it over Boston Coffee Cake is i noticed pound for pound they're cheaper. I'm glad I did. Either one is better then My Grandma's coffee cake honestly. If you think this is good, i recommend trying Fantasicakes or Boston coffee cake. And another thing about My Grandma's coffee cake is it doesn't have enough walnuts in the middle. FYI I ordered My grandma's coffee cake from QVC and one time i saw it at my local Gelson's and thought i'd give it one more try, but had the same result, an off taste i can't put my finger on. It borders moldy/old flavor I'll stick to fantasicakes.

review/summary: Grandma's Coffee Cake - Service Unequal
review/text: I have purchased products from CoffeeCakes.com through Amazon for a while with no problem.  All purchases were gifts, sent to another address, no problem.  I live in New Zealand, sending the purchase to people in the United States.<br /><br />I received an advertisement email directly from CoffeeCakes.com with a discount offer.  I attempted to use this offer, but THEY don't accept orders from nasty foreign countries.  New Zealand is not a corrupt dictatorship full of criminals trying to steal banking info from Americans or trying to get you to claim a million dollars left in a paper bag outside a public toilet.<br /><br />Why do they accept orders placed through Amazon but not made directly to their website?  It has upset me enough to stop buying products from CoffeeCakes.com, even through Amazon.  There are lots of other products to send as gifts to friends in the U.S.

review/summary: The best, but not the only great choice from Mary Janes Farm
review/text: I take these soup packets to work for lunch.  They are incredibly tasty, easy to make using hot water from the coffee machine, organic and wholesome.  I bring along some crackers or bread from home to round out my lunch.  I have also tried the tomato soup, mac and cheese and chili mac.  All are highly recommended for the taste, for the ease of preparation and the fact that you are eating organic at your desk!  The potato soup is my favorite, but all the varieties I have found have been great.  It is so much better than eating from the office cafeteria - cheaper and far better for you.  We eat organic at home and it is great to find a product I can have at the office that is organic as well and that I can have on the spur of the moment.  The whole range of Mary Janes Farm products are highly recommended.

review/summary: holds about 30 k cups
review/text: I just got this, and usually I wait a while after receiving a product to review it, but I don't think my opinion will change of this nifty little basket.  I really like it a a lot.  Here is why:<br /><br />1. It comfortably holds about 30 k-cups, 15 in each basket.<br /><br />2.  It seems more modern and stylish (maybe just more "my style") than the other k-cup holders I've seen.<br /><br />3.  I was hoping that it wouldn't be too overwhelming to have the k-cups just piled in the baskets, and it isn't.  My mom has a holder with a slot for each k-cup, and that's nice, but I like the look of this one better.  And, I like taking a second (because that's all it takes) to look through the baskets.  It's fun.<br /><br />4.  The legs have little rubber feet at the bottom (non-slipping non-scratching).<br /><br />The only thing I noticed that I don't like is that the legs are a little flimsy if you hold the basket firmly and push down on the counter and move the basket part around.  It would be nice if the legs were a little sturdier.

review/summary: Buy 2 Sets. You can make it 4 tier - kinda
review/text: These baskets are great. Stylish and reasonably priced.<br />I do wish they would sell them in higher stacking sets. As this product is made, the best you can do is buy two of these two-basket sets.... and use the top basket from the second set as your third tier. Of course that leaves you with an extra bottom basket.<br />Let me explain. The bottom basket and the top basket are not the same. The top basket is made in a way where it snaps onto the rails of the bottom basket. The bottom basket does not have that hardware on it. So if you buy two sets, you can only create a 3 tier basket. That is.... if you want all the tiers to properly snap together.<br />Personally I took the bottom basket from my extra set and stretched out the legs to be wider than the opening of the basket. I used that as my top (4th tier) basket by letting friction do the work and fitting the legs into the top rail opening of the 3rd tier. It's not the most stable thing in the world.... but it doesn't fall down either.

I looked at the various carousels which hold the K-cups, and they seemed nice, but a bit too rigid. I like the fact that a variety of K-cups can be tossed into the baskets and chosen slightly whimsically. The product takes up the same amount of room as one of those rotating carousels, but for my money and taste, is preferable.

I have a $300 Nespresso machine that looks pretty good on my desk...Don't want a rusted wire basket sitting next to it.  I'm going to just throw this thing out and get a pencil holder or something to keep my pods in.

review/summary: Unusual but surprisingly good flavor
review/text: I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Green tea is my second-favorite of the bunch. The flavor lasts for several minutes (which is unusually long for Spry gums). The combination of green tea and xylitol tastes a little like green tea ice cream (if you've ever had the opportunity to try that).<br /><br />I really like that the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. It's great that I can chew this without having intestinal problems, which is certainly worth an extra star despite the flavor not lasting as long as I would like.

review/text: I too have tried all the flavors of Spry and this one is my second-favorite flavor, aside from Peppermint. The flavor lasts about five to ten minutes. I wish it was a stronger flavor so that it lasted longer but this is really great gum. I also love that Spry used ONLY xylitol for their sweetener and it's why I only chew Spry gum. I also like the texture of their gum, as opposed to gums such as "Extra" brand gum. Spry doesn't make your jaw ache like those other gums do because it doesn't get stiffer or more rubbery as you're chewing it, such as other sugarless gums tend to do.

review/text: I wanted a sugar, artificial color, and aspartame free gum. Spry provided. I'm a heavy chewer and buying gum in blister packs costs a fortune so I was happy to find a gum that came in bulk. The gum does have a pleasant sweet tea taste and unlike the fresh fruit flavor, keeps it's texture better. The fresh fruit tends to get soft and slimy fairly fast. I've chewed the green tea for well over an hour without it going soft. So, unless the texture issue is just a matter of variation in the manufacturing that changes from batch to batch, if you are a truly hard-core gum chewer go with the green tea flavor.

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect from green tea gum, but the flavor is actually pleasant.  My main disappointment with this gum is the texture.  I don't like hard-shell gum to begin with, but this one sort of crumbles a little when you first stick it in your mouth.  You also can't chew it for very long before it gets hard, but they recommend you chew it for 5-10 minutes after eating, so I guess it's not meant to be long-lasting.  Despite these minor flaws, I'm happy with the product.  It came recommended by my dentist, and I feel it's a worthwhile purchase.

review/text: I've never been a gum chewer, but after my last visit to the dentist I was directed to take on the habit.  Apparently chewing xylitol gum can help kill off cavity-causing bacteria in your mouth.  I bought the green tea flavor since it was the cheapest (.05/piece) and I think the flavor is great.  The gum pieces are small and the flavor doesn't last long, but I only need to chew it about 5 minutes for the dental benefit.  I would definitely buy it again! I wish it came in the 600-pack so I could save the extra packaging.

She agrees that the flavor doesn't last long but finds chewing the gum satisfies her desire to much on fattening food.<br /><br />Update: Nov. 2010 - Amazon changed to a new supplier, and the product they shipped was stale.  So, hopefully the supplier and Amazon will make sure they ship the fresh version of this product, not the old leftover stuff.  I change my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because of this.<br /><br />Update: April 2011 - Our last order is so bad that my wife is going to toss out.  Unchewable is the term she uses.  There is clearly some quality control problem in either the manufacturer, storage, or shipping of this product.  Now my wife is going to try and find an acceptable alternative.  I have changed the rating from 4 stars to 2 stars, although the most recent batch is 1 star.

review/text: I bought this gum because of the cost, the flavor and being sugar free  - without reading the reviews.  If I read the reviews before buying I would have seen that this gum is specifically for a dental regimen. It is for after a meal and is not long lasting.  I had planned on giving it away... and then I tried it a few more times, reluctantly, as I needed something!<br />EDIT UPDATE A DAY LATER: I bumped up my review to a 3-star.  I decided to keep this gum on my desk at work.  One afternoon, I popped a piece into my mouth and realized this works better than a mint.  It takes just a minute or two and my breath felt better.<br />EDIT MONTHS LATER: I bumped my review up to 4-stars.  I now reach for this more often.  I guess I'm a reluctant fan.  :-)  Late to the party.  Now, I'm glad I bought this by accident.

review/summary: Xylitol junkie loves this gum :-)
review/text: Before I developed gum diease, I was not a big chewing gum fan.  Now I use a lot of xylitol products, because the bacteria in your mouth will "eat" xylitol, but cannot digest it.  If you use xylitol products regularly and often, you basically starve the bacteria in your mouth so there is less of it, and you are thus less likely to develop cavities and gum issues.<br /><br />So... I'm chewing this for the xylitol, not for pleasure or entertainment. The flavor of most xylitol chewing gums does not last long, and I'm ok with that because I'm looking just to dose my mouth with xylitol every few hours.<br /><br />That said, this is really tasty gum.  It is unlike any other chewing gum flavor out there.  It satisfies my desire for something sweet better than the usual spearmint, fruit or cinnamon.  Texture-wise, it doesn't break down into bits or become stiff and rubbery, so your jaws don't ache after a while.<br /><br />If you're a xylitol fan and looking for a fresh flavor, and if you like your gum sweet sometimes, definitely give this a try.

review/text: I decided to try this because I have sensitivities to artificial sweeteners and the strange ingredients in regular gum. I also tried some other natural gums, and this one worked best for me. The green tea flavor is nice. I keep it in my desk at work and enjoy chewing a little after I have my salad, since I frequently eat onions. It does lose its flavor quickly, but most natural gums do. I really only use it for breath freshening after meals and for flying, so I don't chew it for long periods of time anyway. I would buy it again. Happy to have found a gum that doesn't upset my stomach after chewing it (I'm not swallowing my gum... the juices just run down my throat and my digestive system does not like them from most other gums).

I have discovered that the spry gum's flavor doesn't last very long and it does tend to get rubbery after a while and make your jaw tired. I also chew 3 or 4 pieces at a time to keep from biting my cheek.

review/summary: A Little Tough To Chew, But a Good Choice If Your Looking For an All-Natural Sugar-Free Gum
review/text: Sugar-free gum is usually full of chemicals such as Aspartame and dyes (i.e. Yellow 5 Lake, etc.).  Not so with Spry Green Tea Gum.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it's all-natural.  Even the flavoring is made with real green tea.<br /><br />That being said, the gum is not perfect.  In fact, I enjoy chewing Trident with Xylitol more than I enjoy chewing Spry gum because the Trident keeps its flavor longer and has a softer texture which I enjoy.  Spry gum loses its flavor very quickly and is very tough in texture, so it takes strong jaw muscles to chew it!<br /><br />However, the Spry gum does taste good and I believe that it is healthier for me than a chemical-filled stick of Trident.  So, I chew Spry gum after meals or when I only have a couple of minutes to chew a piece of gum, and I use Trident when I need a good breath-freshening gum or when I plan to be chewing one piece of gum for longer than fifteen minutes or so.<br /><br />This is a good product and I am very pleased that an all-natural sugar-free gum exists.

I ended up starting with Yogurt again so I could recover.<br />Xylitol cannot be used in making bread either it starves yeast as well as bacteria.<br />Sorry, but it sounded too good to be true, didn't it???

review/summary: 7 oz Bag is a little deceptive
review/text: I must admit I have not tried these yet. I was very disappointed when they arrived. Each bag is supposed to be 7 oz, but it is really just a small amount of "pasta" packed in a ton of liquid. I never would have paid this much if I new the weight was based on the liquid. They also look like worms, like the kind your dog gets... round worms.

review/text: I would recommend, given the Prime Shipping and the fact that no where in WI could I find true alcoholic (5%) liquor chocolates like this in time for Xmas. The best flavors are the orange Stoli vodka and the Grand Marnier, but that is IMHO.<br /><br />The batch I tasted a bit on the older side, otherwise I would have given this five stars. Despite that, I will DEFINITELY order these again. Cheers to Amazon for getting these on Prime in time for Santa!

review/text: I bought these as a gift for my sister.  I buy her these every year but I usually buy Anton Berg.  She tried one and commented on the lack of flavor and then we tried several others and yes, they were bland.  The chocolate itself was very good, but the filling inside was just bleh.  I honestly could not tell a difference between the flavors.  So I am going to have to replace it with the real thing.  Not a bad price but in this case you get what you pay for.

However, the item was not so in a mint condition. The wraps of the chocolate were stuck to thr chocolate and were hard to peel. Some chocolate didn't have liquor that was supposed be in. it was leaked to the bottom of the case. I wanted to return the item but most of them were okay condition abd I had to take it the next day so I didn't.<br />I was very satisfied with delivery but not with the product.

They are a little more sour than an American pickle, but once you accept the difference, these pickles are terrific.  We eat them with raclette, the fabulous cheese to melt and enjoy with bread or potatoes.  I am so grateful to be able to get cornichons here.  Maille also makes great dijon mustard.

review/summary: Top Quality, you should do better locally
review/text: We are addicted to these little pickles and keep at least one spare jar on the shelf. They are much crisper and cleaner than the other jarred brands sold on here and in stores.  Many of the brands of cornichones sold in local chain supermarkets taste bad. I have had only two that compare in France. These are not sweet, nor overly sour but well spiced.  They are not overpowered by vinegar.  They are near perfect pickles for putting with high quality cold meats and cheeses.  Great for tuna.  Nice in or alongside crusty breads and grainy mustard.  Fruity wine or all kinds of beer pair well.  Slice the long way for hot dogs and sausages on a bun.<br /><br />I like the pull up insert that takes the place of going spear fishing or sticking your fingers down, or worse, spilling out the brine.<br /><br />See if you can get them for about $7 per jar locally.  The shipping is too costly on top of a higher than happy unit cost.

review/summary: Great alternative to Tabasco,
review/text: As far as Louisiana style sauces go, this is one of the best and cheapest. Most any<br />"local" type establishment you visit in and around New Orleans will have a bottle of<br />Crystal on the table. Its not hot at all, maybe a 3 on a 10 scale, but the flavor<br />particularly for your basic generic Cajun spread is fantastic.<br /><br />The best thing about Crystal is that its not only available at most retail outlets, but<br />its cheap. Locally this 6oz. bottle can be had for $0.69. Comparatively, the 2oz. bottle<br />of Tabasco costs $1.59 at the local grocery so it pays to have a couple of bottles of<br />Crystal laying around. Its also a beautiful stunning red color that I've learned to<br />appreciate over the years of sampling all the Louisiana style sauces. Next to Chef Paul's<br />Magic Pepper Sauce, this is my favorite.<br /><br />Good in stews, gumbos, on fish, chicken and pork when you want all the flavor without<br />the burn. If you're cooking for friends they wont mind you throwing in liberal doses<br />of this stuff. 5 Scovies<br /><br />BTW, I've been a fan of Crystal for a long time and when they introduced their new Extra<br />Hot Sauce recently I got so excited I wrote the company a letter. Well a week later I got<br />a personal note back from the president of Baumer Foods thanking me for my business, and<br />he included 2 coupons for any size Crystal Hot Sauce. These guys are doing it right!

Honestly, these are just terrific little cookies.<br /><br />And when we thought it couldn't get better, we tried the chocolate.  Natural, dense, delicious, dark chocolate taste.<br /><br />We plowed through both bags just going back and forth: lemon, chocolate, lemon, chocolate....<br /><br />No gross artificial taste.  No waxy texture to the cream.  No meek, bland flavors.  Just all-natural goodness that will blow your socks off.<br /><br />Time for another bag.

I will definitely buy this brand again. (Since you get eight bags in the order, I gave my mom a bag, my sister a bag, and a friend a bag of these wafers and they all told me the same thing...they love them, what great lemon taste, etc. and wanted to know where they could purchase them.)
