review/text: Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack, two 10-Ounce Packages.  Arrived today and this is what I was after.  Last time I ordered their medallions and they were terrible.  These premium cuts in the Megapacks are most excellent.  Good flavor and nice texture.  Just how I like it.

review/summary: The Best of Jack Links brands in the 'hot factor category'
review/text: The Peppered brand is my favorite of the 'hot' options from Jack Links beef jerky.  It is on the pricey side, but I subscribe to it anyways currently.  I've tried the Jalepeno brand but, it is not as 'hot' as the Peppered brand -but I still make room for both.<br /><br />Again back to the price... it's on the high side.  Which compels me to eventually research more about making my own beef jerky and then make it closer to what I'm looking for - scorching hot!  Something that includes cayenne, habaneros and the like for a taste to remember!

With Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature, I can make sure that she receives a care package of her favorite beef jerky at school every month.  I get a reminder that it will ship, the shipping is free and I get a discount to boot!  I can't beat it, especially since this flavor can be difficult to find in stores.

review/summary: If you like Jerky this is the best deal I could find
review/text: I know its not the healthiest snack, but there's nothing as satisfying as a nice quality piece of jerky.  It keeps the hunger away longer than all the various candy, chips and other carb snacks.<br /><br />I have order this double package in both Original and Teriyaki, and is the best price I have found when you figure it down to a per oz price.  It's even cheaper if you add it as a "subscription" to be shipped every 1, 2, 3, or 6 months...which you can cancel at any time.<br /><br />One other use I have for this is an extra special treat for my dog.<br /><br />Anyway, this is always high quality jerky.  Only negative is these large backs end up with a bunch of small crumbled shavings in the bottom--guess what then gets poured onto a plate for my dog!!!

As long as I can keep getting this flavor, I will keep sticking choices. This is the best beef Jerky I have ever had. I have been eatting it for years now, and another positive is that it is made in Wisconsin. My only wish is that you could buy this stuff in better quanitity discounts. The small bags are nice for day trips, but it would nice to be able to buy in larger bags for additional discounts.

review/text: Pepper adds a nice kick to beef jerky, and Jack Link makes a nice line of beef jerky. Some of the slices are a bit thin and tough, so personally I like the peppered jerky that is sold at Aldi's grocery stores, but if you don't have an Aldi's in your area, Jack Link's makes a good product, with a nice jerky/peppery taste. Yum.

review/summary: Wish They Were in China
review/text: I live in China, and I am unable to find anything made by Jack Link's here. I am able to buy different beef jerky products here, but they just don't taste the same. Fortunately my mother-in-law and wife gift me with Jack Link's beef jerky on a regular basis. Jack Link's uses premium cuts of meat that are seasoned and smoked in a way that you will find to be delicious. Once you open the bag, be sure to put it in the fridge unless you want your beef jerky to grow some white fuzz. An opened bag of beef jerky that is refrigerated can last for months. I also recommend Jack Link's teriyaki, peppered, sweet & hot, hickory smoked, and steakhouse recipes.

I originally purchased this package of Jack Link for snacking but found myself munching until the entire bag is empty. I first across them on store shelfs in Toledo, Ohio and have not been able to find them in any stores in the Fort Worth,Texas area (until my only other source amazon.com). I love the flavor of the Jalapeno and it is spiced just right. Jack Link is great but Carne Seca is one of the best.

Some of them are pretty good (especially Golden Valley products) but overall none are better than Jack Links. Reliably you get tender, tasty and fresh jerky. I like their original flavor the best. It's not too salty, too sweet, or too hard. It's 'just right' in my opinion.

If you put the entire package into your mouth all at once and chew, there is no way you are gonna taste hot.  This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT.

review/summary: Best mass marketed dried meat product ON EARTH
review/text: I'm normally rather "meh" about beef jerky and similar products (e.g. slim jims and their ilk), but Jack Links are always good, and the sweet and hot variety, for whatever reason, is AMAZING.  So many other varieties of beef jerky are like dry, stale wood chips that you can break your teeth on.  These have an incredible texture, with many huge cuts of meat that are still tender and moist in the center.  They still have the jaw workout that sort of defines beef jerky, but unlike so many other brands they're still recognizable as meat, and good meat at that.  The flavor is much as advertised, which may be a bit too spicy for some, but I love it.  It's heat that very slowly builds, so if you ate a couple of pieces you might not feel it, but after downing a full package you'll be reaching for a vanilla frappe.  The unfortunate thing is that they're hard to find where I live (Cape Cod/Rhode Island), the only place that routinely stocks is Cumberland Farms, and sad to say they seem to have been disappearing even from there.  It will be a real shame if they're discontinued, as in a mass produced snack world full of mediocre, predictable, unsatisfying fodder, Jack Links sweet and hot is the sort of thing you can make a satisfying meal of.

review/text: This is one of the best snacks I have ever had.  I used to eat these in Japan all the time.  I was craving some so I looked online.  I am hoping they will start selling them in the US.  They are kind of tough to describe but basically they are small pretzel nuggets.  They are covered with various flavors but basically salty.  I love the original flavor but they have been coming out with lots of different kinds (chicken, bacon black pepper etc).  There is always a picture of beer on the front of the package because they go great with beer, but really you can eat them anytime.  You would think I was doing a commercial..but seriously I was just looking to eat some and was happy that I got the chance to be the first to review!

review/text: These things are seriously addictive, especially the bacon pepper flavor which is the very best. They're salty and heavily flavored which makes them go well either on a salad or with beer. They're like little barrel-shaped, dense croutons with the occasional whole, seasoned almond in the pack. They're a great snack food and I'd recommend getting your hands on any flavor you can.

review/summary: Great natural food!
review/text: I have a persian cat with a tendancy for oxalate crystals in his urine.  I didn't want to give him Science Diet because of the preservatives.  This food is great!  It is approved for human comsumption and that means a lot to me because I wouldn't want to feed my baby anything I wouldn't be able to eat.  Also, in 2 1/2 years, he hasn't had a single unrinary problem.  I have noticed that even his coat looks better and in general, he has a great disposition.

review/summary: Fab Food My Cat Loves!
review/text: Recently a popular natural cat food changed its formula to include more protein...Little did I know that my 9 year old cat could not digest the new formula...500 dollar vet bill and some heart breaking kitty suffering later I discovered Fromm's Salmon a La Veg. Fromm dry food is made right here in the USA. The cat loves it! It is packed with good fresh wild salmon, Wisconsin cheddar, blueberries and lots of vitamins and omega fatty acids that keeps her healthy and her coat silky and soft! Fromm offers a money back guarantee- if you are thinking about switching food or just want to give your cat or dog some very good food- Go Fromm!

review/summary: Fine Ooolong (Wu Long) Tea
review/text: Sometimes I feel like I've been on a diet forever. Of course, I haven't been -- I've been on and off one or another, then back again.<br /><br />I don't believe any tea is a wonder cure for everything, but I find tea helpful in managing my appetite, my stress levels, and outlook on life. I drink this Oolong tea, really enjoy it, and suspect it helps me feel less hungry in the midafternoon.<br /><br />I've heard it's rich in anti-oxidants, and promotes the burning of fat. It may well be. I've lost bodyfat and weight -- but, again, I believe the result are due to a combination of factors that includes regular exercise, counting calories, and taking time to for a deep breath and a warm cuppa.

review/summary: I Prefer Green Tea to these Vintage Oolong Teabags
review/text: Arrived promptly in 2 days.  The tea was as advertised 100 flo-thru decaffeinated bags at 7 oz.  I enjoy drinking green tea and thought I would give Oolong tea a try.  I did not think that this tea tasted bad but I prefer green tea over these Oolong teabags.  I also ordered "Sea Dyke - Famous Fujian Anxi Golden Oolong (Wulong) Tea - Huangjingui Oolong Loose Leave - High Grade" from piermall.  The loose Oolong tea tasted so much better than these teabags.  The loose Oolong tea was more fragrant and had a smoother taste and did not need any sweetening.  It tasted similar to green tea.<br /><br />My boyfriend loves earlgrey tea and he did not like the Oolong teabags but he loved the loose Oolong tea.<br /><br />It says on the back of the box, "Known throughout Asia as one of China's great treasures, tea is second only to water as a world beverage.  Tea has been linked with health from the very beginning and is prized for its ability to banish fatigue, stimulate the mental powers and raise the energy level.  Recent scientific research reveals that Oolong tea may carry remarkable slimming and health benefits.  Oolong is rich in antioxidants called polyphenols, which is found to be associated with weight loss.  Another important constituent is epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which has been extensively studied as a potential treatment for a variety of diseases, including cancer. Epidemiological data have suggested that EGCG may provide protective effects against hormone related cancers, namely breast or prostate cancer.  *These statements have not been evaluated by FDA.  This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease."

review/summary: Not For Me
review/text: I have been drinking oolong teas for over 40 years, not because of any claimed health benefits, but because I enjoy the flavor - at least most of the time.  After seeing how highly this tea was rated I was really disappointed with how it turned out.  It has a fairly strong bitter taste, and the flavor isn't pleasant at all.  If you open one of the bags you will find the tea has a sawdust consistency, no recognizable leaves at all.  If you want a really good oolong at a reasonable price, I recomend the Numi "Iron Goddess of Mercy" loose tea.

On occasion I drink it hot. It doesn't taste bad, doesn't taste great. The miracle is what it has done for my body! I controls my appetite and I've lost a lot of weight since drinking it.

I thought surely I would gain weight (adding another tragedy to the list) but I started drinking this and my clothes are fitting despite not working out as much.

It is an excellent tea with a very nice and smooth flavor.  Although it is free of caffeine I have found myself feeling more awake after drinking it.  At the same time I feel more energy I also feel as though I am able to think clearer.

Now I can just have a piece of fruit as my snack. It almost feels like my sugar level are stabilized and I no longer crave the junk. I also put some cinnamon in it as I hear that helps suppress appetitite too. I am excited to get on the scale next week. I will wait a few more days.  Finally, something is working for me.

review/summary: Fast shipping, but...
review/text: I have been looking for a big box of this oolong tea, and I don't live near any health food stores. I ordered this and received it in two days. However, the amount of shipping was insane compared to the weight - first class would have been just fine instead of USPS 2-3 Day mail; it was nowhere NEAR a pound to mail.

review/summary: Bland and no signs of health benefits
review/text: Company shipping the tea very fast.  Fair prices.  But the tea itself, just doesn't so it for me.  Very bland and I see no evidence of any health benefits, namely the weight loss effects.  If you want tea that tastes good...try something else.

review/summary: Interesting flavor, great value.
review/text: I drink tea in the winter, and this Oolong was recommended by a Chinese friend in Beijing. I have enjoyed it so far as the cool nights and mornings have finally arrived. It has just enough caffeine for a little lift in the morning, perfect for me.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: This tea taste so yummy!  I find that when I drink it I do not eat as much as I usually do.  I will lose weight, because it will keep me feeling full if I drink it throughout the day.  It is worth a try!  It is a great price for any kind of tea, it keeps me full (it may you as well) and if you replace it with sugary drinks you will lose weight for sure!

review/summary: Tasty tea
review/text: I'm not a huge tea drinker (coffee every day) but I do enjoy black tea, Earl Grey, Chai tea and this tea is a nice addition. I bought it because I'd heard good things about it including Dr. Oz recommending it. At that point it was a question of which of the many oolongs on AMazon do I buy. I bought three. They are all very similar in flavor, require a touch of sweetener for my tastes but are very good. They are all a bit subdued in flavor with this one being in the middle. I've had no problems with the bags breaking or tea leaves or dust being everywhere.

review/text: I've been using this tea for years... I never get tired of it.  It taste mild yet its delicious,this tea is perfect after dinner or anytime during cold weather.  I've noticed that for some reason it eliminates my craving for chocolates and other sweet stuff, I have no room for dessert after dinner,all I need is a cup of  tea then I become full and satisfied.

review/summary: Second Order
review/text: This my second order and I will continue to use this tea as long as it is available.  I don't live near an Oriental grocer so this is a wonderful opportunity to get great tea at a reasonable price.  I drink mostly green tea so the Wu Long is a nice alternative.  It is mellow yet has a distinct taste.  From what I have read it is also good for you.  Most of the time I make single cups of the Wu Long, but it also mixes well with green teas and flavored teas.

review/summary: Hard to drink plain
review/text: This is my first experience with Wu Long tea of any kind.  I have to admit, it's quite bitter and hard/almost impossible for me to drink without adding tons of liquid stevia.  I even tried mixing it with my Lipton mixed berries green tea that I love, to no avail.  Finally, I decided to add vanilla flavored almond milk and stevia.  It's more of a dessert drink now that I actually ENJOY drinking.  After a few days now of drinking it, I can tell that it decreases my appetite and the scale may have been lying, but it was two pounds lighter today than it was 3 days ago, so overall, 4-5 days into drinking this tea, I'm happy with it.  Just as a side note though, I'm not sitting on the couch eating bon bons as I drink this and losing weight.  I'm a very healthy eater (green smoothies, raw nuts & veggies, fresh fruit, lean meat, etc., who exercises light to moderately).

review/summary: Great Daily Tea!
review/text: The tea came in a very timely manner, just a few days. So that was very nice. The price was great too. Our local store sells a box of 20 for $15, here we got 100 for $10!  Since both my husband and I are very fond of this type of tea, and have to keep the budget tight, that was awesome!<br /><br /> The tea itself was, at first, milder than the other tea I was used to. However, the flavor increased dramatically when I poured hotter water over it and actually let it sit for 3-5 mins before drinking. Hot water seems to definitely be key. I usually use warm water so I can drink my tea right away. Patience is a virtue with this tea however, and you will acquire a stronger better flavored tea if you are patient. I've been enjoying this tea for so long now in this fashion, that I'm not entirely sure if the other tea is stronger anymore. And since I'm not sure, it's obviously not enough of a difference to matter to me.<br /><br /> Like most oolong teas, the tea will acquire a slightly bitter taste if left too long. I personally don't mind it, even enjoy it, but I know some people don't. This tea is like others in that regard.<br /><br /> An added bonus of oolong tea, and this one included, is the increased metabolic rate you get. I generally drink my tea in either a standard mug, or by putting it in my 20oz water bottle for work (make no mistake, 1 bag of tea is plenty even for 20 oz!). Yes, I have felt the increase in metabolism. It works best on a mostly empty or only lightly filled stomach. I find I get quite warm through out my entire body about 20mins after drinking it, similar to how you feel after a good warm up before working out (the kind that leaves you feeling like your own mini-furnace!). A fuller stomach will make you feel the effect less, but I still retain a pleasantly warm sensation throughout my body.<br /><br /> Since I have only just restarted my workouts for the year, I can't tell you if this tea has had any effect on my effort to get back in shape. However, the increase in metabolism is always good and every little bit in that area helps!<br /><br /> I enjoy this tea mainly at the beginning of my day. I find both green a dark teas to be a bit too strong for my liking at 5:30am. This one fits the bill nicely.<br /><br /> When this round of tea runs out, I do plan to purchase this tea again!

review/summary: Good value for money
review/text: This reasonably priced product isn't as rich in flavour as some wuyi teas. Instead, it has a surprisingly light, flowery flavour. I liked it, but I was a slightly disappointed because I was expecting something else. Definitely seems to have an appetite-suppressing effect &, for that alone, it's worth every penny. AND... it's cheaper for 100 tea bags than any off the shelf supermarket teas.

review/summary: If you have, or suspect your have, hypothyroidism.
review/text: I tried some of this tea yesterday evening.  I have been battling adrenal and hypothyroid problems and getting much better through the use of natural glandulars (Armor thyroid is natural, as is cortef) products and many supplements and healthy life choices in general.  Last night and today, after the tea, I felt awful.  My morning underarm temp had dropped significantly and I just feel cold in general. I have been weak and tired and shaky all day, though at first I did not know why. Should have researched more first, but like most teas oolong tea has flouride and that is bad for a hypothyroid condition.  I can't guarantee the tea is the reason for the downturn, but it is something to think about if you get it and feel the same way. I am giving this product 3 stars because it came quickly, was nicely boxed and tastes fine.
