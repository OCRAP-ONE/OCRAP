review/summary: Best of the Best
review/text: With my new Sheltie puppy I wanted to give her the best food possible. I started her out on a slow mix of Origen. I started at 25% mixed with the food her breeder had her on, and even on that small of an amount she had very loose stools and horrible gas. After a couple of weeks of trying to give her Origen, I gave up and tried Wellness (less protein, still a good food) and again, the loose stools. I then read about Fromms puppy gold and did some research and decided to try it. From the beginning I tried 50/50 (I really wanted her off the Purina)and she did great on it. After two days I went to straight Fromms and we'll never change from here. She is healthy, bright eyes, great coat, and she loves it! This is a high quality food from a trusted manufacturer. My puppy just couldn't handle the other brands I tried, but this one is great and it smells great when you open the bag. I highly recommend this best-kept secret among premium holistic dog foods. AND, they tell you on their website that their fish and fish meal are Ethoxyquin free. (A known carcinogen for people). The founder of this company created the Distemper vaccine. Check out this food, you'll be happy you did.

review/summary: Very good puppy food.
review/text: This is hands-down the best puppy food out there. My puppy is a good eater (pretty much eats cardboard like it's a T-bone), but after switching to this puppy food, her coat became shinier, and stools were much better consistency. She was also getting a lot of eye discharge (the normal red stuff), and this dog food seems to reduce that quite a bit. Thanks, Fromm!

review/summary: THE PEPPER...The pepper of all peppercorns!!!
review/text: For those who, like myself, were thinking that pepper was pepper was pepper, well let me tell you, it's not true. Being something of an amateur gourmet I tried every marinade,spice, and rub under the sun for ribeyes, New York strips, filet mignon, etc., and I even tried your average salt and pepper, and it was all okay, but not a knockout. Then I tried Tellicherry Pepper and Sea Salt, all freshly-ground in my handy-dandy Graviti battery-powered peppermill (also something "you gotta love"!) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OLNC46">Trudeau Graviti Black Pepper Mill</a> Suddenly salt and pepper were once again the best things ever on a piece of meat. So simple, and this Tellicherry Pepper is what did it. TRY IT!!!!!!

review/summary: Wonderful flavor
review/text: Steaks, soups, and all other expensive and carefully prepared food deserve the best ingredients and condiments.  Regarding pepper, our family strongly favors coarsely ground peppercorns.  I am inclined to India Tree brand Tellicherry because: they are as close to the source as one can find; they offer very economical packaging; there is nothing but peppercorns in the package (what is in ground pepper?); there is absolutely no unknown "sediment" at the bottom of the container; they are solely committed to supplying these peppercorns; and they have provided a most memorable enhancement of fine food.  Note that white tellicherry peppercorns are nothing but black peppercorns with the very tasty and pungent black husk removed.  To me, mixing black and white Tellicherry is merely dilution of the essential flavor.

review/summary: Like Discovering Fresh Ground Pepper All Over Again
review/text: This is my first time buying Tellicherry peppercorns and I am impressed!<br /><br />I loaded up my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CFB4N">Unicorn Magnum Plus</a> with these peppercorns, ground some on various foods, and WOW! It's like I'm discovering the joys of fresh-cracked pepper for the first time all over again. I can't wait to season some nice thick steaks with this.<br /><br />The flavor is very bold compared to the McCormick peppercorns I had been using. And from what I gather, this is a great price for Tellicherry peppercorns.<br /><br />My only concern is that it will take me and my wife a _long_ time to go through two pounds of this stuff. I actually purchased the two 1-Pound Bags instead of the one big glass jar. At the time I purchased, that was actually a little bit cheaper by ounce. Also, it comes in two packages, and the unopened one seems to be sealed well. Still, I plan on vacuum packing the packages between refills to help keep the flavor fresh.<br /><br />I can tell you this: I'll never again buy cheap pepper.

My wife and I performed a taste test between Costco's brand and India Tree's brand and neither of us could tell the two apart. Given that the Costco brand offers a far greater value for, essentially, the same taste sensation as India Tree, my wife and I will not be purchasing India Tree peppercorns again. FYI, I have no association with Costco other than as a consumer. I hope this helps!

review/summary: Sling some of this on your pasta. Yumbo!
review/text: These are fresh and tasty.  I really have no idea how fresh the ingredients are, but they smell, look, and (especially) taste very fresh.  If you've ever gotten infused oil products before ...you know that sometimes (especially with garlic, IMO-it can really be stinky) the product tastes heavy and the aroma is also. Sometimes that may be a freshness issue-sometimes ingredients are just not good...but I have encountered that several times before. This is light on my tongue, not overpowering as an herb or a spice... and I have been using it for pastas the past several days. Two friends of mine already noticed it on pasta in the last three days and asked about it. Very handy for a cook, very tasty, and I have already ordered most of their infused oils. Just for information...the ingredients are -Sunflower oil, extra virgin olive oil, diced garlic, diced parsley, natural garlic extract flavor. I thought maybe this last ingredient might make it heavy if it was not fresh. It is very good. The "best before" date on mine is 3/13/10. Todays date is 3/14/09. I recommend this and will buy it again.

They were shipped promptly and arrived in good condition. We have enjoyed Cherry Cheesecake and Lemon Pie all ready and look forward to many more. The pack of 12 is a good buy, especially considering it qualifies for free shipping. What a great way for something different from the traditional graham cracker crusts.

review/summary: wish they were in glass bottles
review/text: I wish these were in glass bottles, but sometimes UPS beats boxes up pretty good, so I see why they're not. The water sitting around in #1 plastic for who knows how long means the plastic could leach into the water. Free delivery of bottled water from Amazon is really fast. I wish I could find cases of this stuff locally, ideally in glass bottles. I don't know why that's so difficult. I realize that coming all the way from Italy this water has a huge carbon footprint. With a little Torani syrup (also well priced and promptly delivered free by Amazon) in the bottom of a glass, topped off with Pellegrino, you have a delicious, inexpensive soda without all the chemicals of traditional soda. Yes, the Torani has sugar, but it's pure cane sugar, not high fructose corn syrup. We also use Pellegrino to cut and fizz up lemonade and juices. In the glass bottle, on ice, Pellegrino is a great alternative (or supplement) to wine at dinner. The merchant who makes this available in glass bottles, by the case, with free delivery, will be very busy. I wouldn't even mind paying a little more.

review/summary: You get what you can afford!!
review/text: I've been drinking this water since last year, and am still in LOVE with them.<br />Not only they taste better than (perrier, personally) any other water, it appears to be shedding my body fat. Of course, you need to watch your diet and excersize to loose weight, but I can clearly say that this water was helping me loosing weight. Now, it's not the main reason why I drink this. Just like this water, any alkiline(with higher pH) water will be absorbed to you body almost twice as fast as your regular drinking water. When I play basketball, I sweat like a hog. But as soon as I take a sip(full sip) of this water(or any alkiline water), you can feel that your body is sucking that H2O from your stomach as soon as it gets consumed, then you start sweating much more right after.<br /><br />As a health profession, with much knowledge of histology and physiology, it seems like I can picture how my cells are absorbing that H2O(supposedly, polarized due to the high pH) at a very faster rate than regular water. You go to bathroom much more frequently, and I see my urine gets as clear as it can be. I do assume that it will also benefit your kidneys by actively clearing those biproducts(i.e. CO2, etc.) of your body.<br /><br />I know that high price of this water is the main drawback. I go to Costco, and sometime they sell a case of 12 glass bottles at a cheaper price. Recently, Amazon had it avaliable at a very good price, but still anybody will be offended by it's high price over other cheaper bottle waters.<br /><br />Like I said, you get what you can afford, and go with your budget. Still this water is very expensive for me, but I simply cut on my expense on ther beverages like Cola or beer/wine. If you put more value on this type of water than other beverages, it's still affordable, I think.

Reason for recommending cans: once you open a bottle or can of sparkling water, they go flat in no time flat (no pun intended).

review/text: I'm not gluten free but my daughter is, so I thought I'd try these crackers.  They are sooooo yum!  I couldn't keep myself or my guests (none of whom are gluten free) from gobbling up the whole box.  Which is why now I"m on Amazon buying in bulk.  They're on the salty side, which is why I love them, but just be warned in case you're watching your sodium intake.  I also recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBLED4">Back To Nature Gluten Free Rice Thin Multi Seed Crackers</a>, though the Sesame Seed ones are my favorite.

review/summary: good cracker for gluten free
review/text: I give this cracker a 4 star only because its expensive.  Its a good tasting cracker plain or with a dip.  Its hard to find a cracker that is wheat, dairy, soy, or free of most chemicals.  The shinny surface is typical of rice flour crackers I've tried before.  Because it's made in the same factory as wheat or nuts is not necessarily a reason to not use this product.  If you want to try different crackers, try a box from Walmart (Michigan) then purchase online.  Thank you "Back to Nature Foods."

review/summary: delicious gluten-free cracker!
review/text: these crackers are delicious and are my new favorite #1 GF cracker beating out Sesmark Savory Rice Minis, Sesame Garlic, 5.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6) as they are sturdier, larger, tastier and without soy! They are better to dip with and to eat plain right out of the box or top with cheeeeeeeeeeeeese please! I discovered them today at Sprouts Everything GF is 25% off Extravaganza for two dollars forty six cents per box or three bucks when not on sale also Whole Foods carries them for $3.69ea so I appreciate the Amazon subscriber savings - also saves me on gasoline.

review/text: These are the best crackers I have ever tasted. These are made with butter but this English company also makes water crackers and whole wheat crackers. I was given these crackers along with some French cheese and I was surprised at how good a cracker can be. The ovals are large so you break off a piece and put whatever you like on them but they excel with cheeses. A perfect background that you can taste but which does not interfere with whatever is on top of them. A great gift along with cheese or whatever. This is now my go-to cracker!

I served this to friends and they loved the mellow chocolate flavor and smooth coffee experience so much they were asking what kind I buy and where.  Originally, I purchased this in a Sam's Club in Michigan, but I live in Chicago.  So I thought I'd get online and see if I could buy it.  Now I plan on buying only this brand for as long as I can get it.  Try the Hazelnut and Traverse City Cherry flavors, too!  So good without the flavor being over whelming, the coffee still comes through.  Serious coffee for serious coffee lovers.

review/summary: Intense Lime Experience, Delicious and Unusual
review/text: *****<br />Dry Desert Lime is an unusual premium Numi tea. It is herbal tea (caffeine-free) containing solely dried lime---that's all---not lime and green/black tea, not artificial lime flavor, but real lime---alone---a truly remarkable feat. It is certified organic, and is kosher. It has the most amazing tart and lovely taste. If you like lime, you'll love this tea. If you don't like lime, definitely pass, as it is a very intense "lime experience". I love it!<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer lyrically writes: "From the far reaches of the Arabian Desert, this rare lime has been enjoyed for thousands of years, both as a spice in Middle Eastern cuisine and as a teasan. Traditionally harvested and dried in the hot desert sun, this oasis of Vitamin C has been drunk to soothe just about everything. The first taste brings a distant yet familiar impression, leaving the trace of a fleeting memory on the tip of your tongue. We find that its clean, bracing, and reviving citrus pleasure, nicely balanced with a touch of sugar, lifts the blues. Try it, you'll fall in love with it!"<br /><br />If you like Numi teas and enjoy lime, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love lime, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. In fact, I have never heard of anyone else making this tea. I enjoy serving it to company, but even more, just for me.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: An unusual but absolutely wonderful tea!!!
review/text: I grew up in Virginia, where tea is always green, sweet and iced! I have drank plenty of tea growing up and pretty much fell away from it as an adult. After having hot tea at several Chinese restaurants, I was amazed to learn, all tea isn't sweet iced tea! :)<br />My quest for the perfect cup of tea thus began!<br /><br /> In the past 2 years I have ordered every type of tea imaginable & have came across quite a few nice teas.. I have learned some that smell wonderful taste drab & some that smell drab taste wonderful.. I just recently came across Numi teas, while trying to find a company that made rose tea (which Numi does & I have to tell you, it's a very delightful tea, which was sinfully delicious when brewed with jasmine).<br /><br />I ordered the Numi Dry Desert Lime on a whim... I had never heard of such a tea & although I have never enjoyed lemon tea, I love lemonade & lime drinks, so I thought why not? That was the BEST decision I have made in a long time! It is NOTHING like "tea with lemon", as the package states, it is 100% desert lime. It is wonderful hot & very refreshing cold. I never add more than a occasional dash of honey to my hot teas, but I have to admit to adding one pack of splenda to this tea.. It created the perfect blend of "sweet & sour". I gave a cup to my mom & she preferred it plain, so try it out both ways, as well as hot & cold! I absolutely adore this tea & will be ordering it again very soon!

review/summary: Tart without sour!  Refreshing Lime
review/text: The dark brown brew resulting from Numi Tea Dry Desert Lime is deceptive.  It looks like regular tea.  It's aroma is mild, but it's flavor is amazingly refreshing, a citrus treat.<br /><br />I'm not especially fond of sour tastes, I normally need extra sugar and ice in my lemonade, and many herb teas turn me off for their strong sour flavor (possibly the hibiscus?).  Pleasantly, and inexplicably, this Numi Lime tisane delivers bright, tart flavor that is somehow mellowed and without the unwanted burning aftertaste of so many other citrus beverages.<br /><br />Above and beyond the rich lime-juice flavor is this amazing light and exotic aftertaste - I can only suppose it's a product of fermenting and drying the lime peels.  It is an earthy, misty and mysterious flavor, but as odd as it is, it is also ephemeral and fleeting. Just a hint of a chergui in your teacup, if you allow your imagination to draw it out.<br /><br />I've tried Numi Dry Desert Lime with stevia, with honey, with agave, but I confess my favorite is to add only a pinch of demerara raw sugar.  Iced is so refreshing, warm is fortifying.  Great stuff!  I may never touch a hibiscus-based tisane again.

review/summary: My Picky Cat LOVES this food!
review/text: I was advised to try this food by a worker at Petco when I was having difficulty finding wet cat food that my cat would like. His wet food 3oz per day would sit in his dish for hours with him only touching a little bit of it. It was a total waste of money for me.<br /><br />At first I was questioning the quality of the food because it was set in between the cheaper low supermarket brand cat foods instead of it being placed near the higher quality foods like Wellness, Natural Balanace, Blue Buffalo etc. The worker said.... "just try one 3oz can and see if your cat likes it." I looked at the ingredients and it looked like a pretty good food list. I give my cat a dry combo of Nature's Variety Rabbit Food with Blue Buffalo adult so I know he is getting great dry food in his system so I wasn't too worried about the wet not being up to the level of the dry as long as the food wasn't full of crappy stuff.<br /><br />Well I gave him him the Shrimp flavored one first the other day and he literally ate it in 3 or 4 minutes without stopping to take a break. I then went back to Petco to buy some more Shrimp and figured I should just try all of the flavors. Well, there wasn't much to choose from. Apparently cat owners are getting told about this wonderful food and the stores are running low on it. I picked up the Chicken & Pumpkin(gone in 3 minutes again yesterday) as well as the Tuna in Gravy ( ate it this morning in less than no time) so I am really glad the Petco worker suggested this food for me.<br /><br />The foods come either in a gelee or a gravy. My cat loves both of them. I hate to tell more cat owners about this food in fear that the shelves will be completely empty when I need cat food but I just couldn't help spreading the good news about this new food I found.<br /><br />I would not hesitate trying this food. It seems to be a winner in my house!!

review/summary: Excellent step up from the supermarket variety
review/text: I was shopping for a balsamic vinegar that was "better" than the basic types you can find in a typical, non-gourmet supermarket. I found this one in an Italian shop in Little Italy, NYC and was assured that it was one of their better brands - however, for the "best" you had to spend a lot more. Not ready to spend bigger bucks, I brought this one home and tried it with fresh mozzarella, Jersey tomatoes, fresh basil and a drizzle of good olive oil. Mmmmm. The difference in flavor, complexity and finish was instantly noticeable. There is an instant hint of sweetness followed by the tang of of acetic acid. If you have only had the $5 / 32 oz bottle of balsamic that's sold in the supermarkets, step up to something significantly better. You will be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />However, to fully appreciate good balsamic vinegar, you need to taste some of the aged (and more expensive) offerings. My local Italian food store gave me a taste of their "house" balsamic - a direct import. It was sweeter with a much milder acid finish. Plus the consistency was more like a syrup than a traditional wine vinegar. Sorry, I don't have the name but it costs about fifty percent more than this one and I think, for a treat, it's worth it. For every day use, this one fits the bill. The owner also said that the balsamics costing upwards of several hundreds of dollars are for "special occasions". Again, for every day, vinegars like Fini are perfect.

review/summary: Try it and EXPERIENCE the difference!
review/text: I have always known that FINI has the better vinegars, be they wine vinegars or otherwise. I like sour things over sweets in general. Recently, another connaisseur of vinegar gave me a bottle of this Balsamic vinegar... It is outstanding! there is a blend of subtle flavors and tastes to it! It is NOT like any other Balsamic vinegars found at a lower prices in this country...beyond description! I still use a few drops of Champagne vinegar or FINI red wine vinegar (when not available, any wine or apple-cider  vinegar) to give a "zing" to my salad dressing.<br /><br />I just purchased a 3 bottle pack (free S&H) from Amazon (cheaper than at my local stores). I'll see how long it lasts. With that knowlege, next time, I'll buy a 6-bottle pack for a lower price.<br /><br />This is the no.1 Balsamic vinegar for me, so far. I haven't tasted those $40/oz Balsamic vinegars... so tasteful, and aged for so long that only one drop is needed on your after-dinner cheese. As I don't eat cheese, I may splurge and get a tiny bottle one day on one of my frequent trips to Italy.

review/text: We love Dorset cereals and the Berries and Cherries variety is no exception. This Muesli is not overly sweet, pleasantly tart due to the berries, and very filling. My husband prefers it with milk, I tend to enjoy it with my Greek yogurt - it's great both ways and definitely a healthier alternative to these sugar ladden cereals found normally in grocery stores.<br /><br />My only gripe is that Amazon does not carry all the varieties - we have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LL4N3O">Dorset Cereals Simply Fruit And Seeds, 12-ounces (Pack of 5)</a> on subscription and just wish the others were available for that as well.

review/text: I bought Dorset Muesli Berries and Cherries for my husband because he loves muesli and granola.  The ingredients are simple and looked delicious.  Unfortunately, my husband didn't care for it, and after tasting it myself, I see why.  This muesli has a gritty taste and texture (the berries and cherries are yummy, but the oats are dry and chalky).  Also, this cereal leaves a bitter aftertaste.  While I wanted to like this, it just wasn't a hit and I won't be purchasing this again.

The size of the box should have been smaller with more packing material. Its obvious that there was way too much room for these heavy objects to move around and cause damage. It was a real sticky mess.<br />Smaller box, more effective padding would have made a big difference.<br />Thanks<br />Deanna miller.

The mint flavor is much stronger than the ordinary peppermint tea that I buy in the supermarket.<br /><br />However this is not peppermint tea, but a combination of mint flavors. The result is amazing.<br /><br />The coffee shop served a huge 16 oz cup of tea. When I finished the first cup, I asked for a refill of hot water, and there still was enough strength left in the tea bag for another great cup of tea.<br /><br />If you like mint tea that is robust, then you will love this tea.<br /><br />Note: The rating on this product has unfairly been lowered by earlier reviews complaining about the price. However, the current price on Amazon of ten dollars plus a dollar for shipping is actually less than the current price with shipping on the Mighty Leaf website.

I happily spent the $16+ dollars on the only size (2 pack) that they had in stock, and greedily awaited the arrival of what I hoped to become a new tradition. Nope. Wrong.  The "cheese" was gummy, sour and plastic-y tasting. It wasn't even as good as it's orangey yellow sister, the regular Velveeta! So strong and off putting, that I threw it all in the trash.<br />I was telling my aunt this story, and surprisingly she, a huge fan of the same restaurant chain, had this stuff, and had found it a dud as well. Serious bummer. So much potential, and such a disappointment.

review/summary: Hard to believe this is sold as food
review/text: This is the first time a product has been so bad, I actually took a photo of the microwaved result so I could show my friends. The noodles looked like bloated invertebrates, and the color of the microwaved concoction prior to stirring drew the word "burned" to my brain. After stirring, it looked like a dull brown color, perhaps a weak gravy sauce rather than the reddish-toned sauce one usually sees when this dish is properly prepared, and not even the peanuts could liven up the sad tone and posture of the dish. I wondered where the food came from that was photographed for the box cover - it certainly was nothing like what came inside the box. Looking at the results, I had NO desire at all to taste it, but knowing I would probably post a review somewhere, I dutifully chewed on a spoonful.<br /><br />I've had decent-tasting items from this company before, so I hoped the taste would not reflect the awful appearance of the food. Sad to say, it tasted even worse than it looked. There was no real flavor to speak of, and something in me felt uneasy about the idea of consuming any more of the stuff. I am not one to waste food ever, but I felt no remorse on throwing this product away because it really didn't fit my idea of "food". My one regret is I can't remember which local store victimized me by selling it to me, or I would have taken the entire thing back and demanded a refund.

review/summary: Wh.. What is this?
review/text: Don't be fooled by the packaging labeling this product as "pad thai"... this is nothing resembling pad thai. The sauce is an awful rendition of some generic Asian flavoring (think a sickly sweet-sour sauce). Nothing close to tasting like pad thai at all, and whatever it does taste like, it tastes horrible. Although the best by expiration date is several months in the future, the peanut topping was rancid. Even for the non-pickiest of eaters, this is quite unpalatable. Would recommend you absolutely avoid this product.

review/summary: Could get better tasting ramen for cheaper!
review/text: Does not taste like pad thai, way too sweet. Also, once you take it out of the package you're not hungry anymore. The noodles look like gross white worms tightly packaged in plastic. The whole thing just looks entirely unappetizing and smells the same.

review/summary: This Was So Gross It Wouldn't Stay Down
review/text: I used to purchase a microwaveable Pad Thai by Thai Kitchen at my local grocery store that was a Thai version of cup-o-noodles, edible but not tasty. You had to fill the container with hot water, let sit for a few minutes then drain and stir in freeze-dried veggies and powdered sauce packet. I thought this was that product with a new package. I was severely mistaken. I bought this product because it is gluten free and I was flying to France for a vacation. I took 3 of the packages along with me to hold me over on the flight. In the last 2 hours of our flight, I pulled it out and much to my surprise the noodles did not need cooking (if you can call soaking in hot water for a few minutes cooking) and the sauce was already a liquid. I tried my hardest to eat it but it was just too disgusting that I was only able to eat approximately 1/3 of it. As we began to prepare for landing, I started to feel very ill and ended up puking everywhere. I travel quite frequently by plane (including independently owned planes) but this was the first time in my life that I have ever thrown up in a plane. In addition, I have never been motion sick in my life, therefore I attribute my sickness entirely to this product.

review/summary: So bad I thought I was doing something wrong
review/text: This looks absolutely delicious from the picture. I love pad thai and the thought of a cheap quick tasty one was really intriguing. The sauce burns when you cook it and the taste is abysmal...I then tried adding more water to dilute the sticky black goo they call there sauce. It got better but this is still by far the worst pre-packaged meal I have ever had.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and save your money...this company should be absolutely ashamed...someone had to have tasted this before selling it so the fact that it made it into stores is repulsive. I will never buy anything from this company and will tell as many people as I can as well not to.

review/summary: A complete Abomination of my favorite Thai dish
review/text: Having been given the opportunity to visit Thailand and frequenting the many Thai restaurants where I live I can honestly say I am spoiled when it comes to this dish. But now that I am in college and live in a dorm I picked this up at the local Lucky grocery and figured how bad could it be. Just look at the picture on the package. Sure it's missing sprouts and lemon and shrimp but it essentially looks like the dish it claims to be. Well one night after working out I was starving and decided to try this entree out. The minute I opened the package and saw the sauce i knew something was wrong. Like the previous reviewer stated, the sauce is nowhere close to being the flavor of Pad Thai. It looks like they just packaged some Hoisin sauce (which is popular to the Vietnamese when eating with Pho) but not Pad Thai!<br /><br />This is by far the worst microwave dinner ever conceived. As I write this I am looking at the packaging I notice in fine print "PRODUCT of CHINA." Well that explains everything. Why is a Thai dish being made by China?! On the other hand, I'd like to give the marketing team 5 stars for the excellent packaging that suckered me into buying this awful product. Thanks.

review/summary: The most repulsive thing I've ever eaten
review/text: When you buy an item like this, you know the chances of it being great or even good are fairly slim, but you expect that it will be edible. In the case of Thai Kitchen's Pad Thai bowl, that's a hideoussly misguided expectation. The "vegetables" included are dried shavings, not even as substantive as the tiny carrot chunks you get in a Cup O' Soup; and the sauce? It's like some terrible sweet and sour sauce you'd get from McDonald's--terminally sweet, with no hint of anything I've ever tasted at even a budget-on-the-run Thai restaurant. I've never had anything so repulsive--and I once mistook chocolate syrup for gravy and served it on turkey.

review/summary: Not worth the money
review/text: You get a packet of pre-cooked noodles, which don't taste like the plastic they come in, fortunately.  Also, a large packet of sauce.  And a small packet with about a quarter teaspoon of dehydrated "veggies" - yup, a quarter teaspoon.  And a small packet of peanut chunks.  Pad Thai has all kinds of things in it, and this does not.  I really don't think it was very tasty, nor was it worth the money.

review/summary: Fresh, crispy and the perfect sweet / salty snack delivered straight to your door
review/text: I love Chicago style popcorn (that perfect balance of cheese and caramel) and go to great lengths to get "the good stuff".  It is hard to get the perfect Chicago style but I am so pleased to have found KuKuRuZa and love the fact that Amazon will drop it off right at my doorstep!<br /><br />Finding a high quality Chicago style corn has always been a bit of a challenge.  The holiday season always brings the obligatory bucket of three flavors but the popcorn is not fresh and doesn't make my taste buds dance..  Occasionally I order from the other website (starts with a G) but it is so expensive it is hard to justify more than once a year.  Even less often I will trek out of my way to the mall and get a bag mixed up but it is a pain to fight the crowds.<br /><br />This popcorn was amazing!  The cheese was nice and cheesy and the caramel was light and crispy.  There was a 50/50 ratio which is typical but I like my popcorn a little saltier and tend to like 2 parts cheese to 1 part caramel but the kid and the husband picked up the slack and helped to finish the caramel that I left behind.  I will definitely order this popcorn again!  Perhaps next time I will add in an extra bag of cheddar and create my own mix.

review/summary: Great Taste
review/text: I am always looking for something to take to the office to have for lunch.  I enjoy items that are different and have flavor.  This item was a pleasant surprise.  There was just enough Citrus flavor and spice to make this simple dish a nice treat for lunch.  I do wish the ingredients were listed before purchasing.  I am a vegetarian, preferring to be vegan.  This item does contain milk.  If you are a Vegan, then this item is one to overlook.  I do recommend adding a little brocolli, carrots, peas, or pea pods with this dish.
