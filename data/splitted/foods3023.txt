review/summary: A very nice sauce
review/text: I just tried this for the first time. It is quite good.<br />I have been to India and I am an accomplished home chef and this product is an authentic flavor.<br /><br />The product description is unintentionally a little bit misleading. This product is not a ready to eat meal in a pouch.but rather more of a ready to use sauce, and a very good one at that.<br /><br />I prepared it this way.<br />I cooked up some rice, mushrooms some cut up green squash and green pepper pieces.<br />I am not a vegetarian so I also added some lean ground beef but that's optional.<br /><br />I cooked my added ingredients and then added this heated Indian sauce.<br />The result was a very nice nutritious and filling meal. Not spicy or too salty.<br />Including the rice the whole meal took me about 20 minutes to cook.<br />So simple any one can do it.<br /><br />This recipe will easily feed 2 hungry people or as I did put half in the fridge for a nice hassle free left over meal for later. In my experience coked foods like this keep very well in the fridge and usually improve after a few days they also reheat nicely in the microwave.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to my friends who enjoy Indian cuisine.<br /><br />Dean

review/summary: Great Flavor, Perfect Spice and Easy to Make Your Own
review/text: This is fantastic. One of the go to dinners for my wife and me. It has just enough spice to make you take notice, but not too much to overpower the flavor that comes from a great combination of Indian spices. We beef it up sometimes with some extra kidney beans and shredded chicken to make the meal more complete. You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: India-NOMMMMM FOOD!
review/text: I bought the Kidney Bean Curry and a few other of the Kitchens of India ready to eat packages when Amazon had them for the deal of the day. I believe they winded up coming out to about $1.50 per 10oz package, which isn't to shabby considering regular price they are about $3-3.50 each regular price.<br /><br />This was the first flavor I decided to taste.<br /><br />Upon opening the package and placing it into a bowl I could see a ton of oil floating on the top. I don't understand why most food makers / chef's feel the need to add so much oil to their dishes, but it was a bit offsetting to look at.<br /><br />I pressed out as much as I could from the package, but there did not seem to be a lot. Be careful too when opening because it comes sliding out pretty quickly and you can end up with a big mess!<br /><br />I was thinking I would not be able to eat it all in one sitting before I opened the package, but after pouring it in the bowl I could clearly see it wasn't going to be enough at all to fill me up.<br /><br />That being said, you definitely are going to want to eat this with something else such as naan or rice. I wouldn't expect to open a package, eat it alone, and fill you up.<br /><br />Now onto the taste...<br /><br />I can definitely taste the cumin. Seems a bit strong in the dish, but it wasn't too overpowering. Also, I like my food spicy and normally add more spice to already spicy food. But with this one I didn't add any spices.<br /><br />I was not a strong spice at all but it was still spicy enough for me (on that particular day, lol).<br /><br />Overall, I liked the taste of the ready to eat Kidney Bean Curry. I dont think I would pay full price for them based of the portion size being seemingly small, but if they are on sale I would probably get more later on down the road.<br /><br />I can not wait to taste the others as well, and although it definitely does not replace the great taste of going to an authentic Indian restaurant, the price you will pay for these compared to the restaurant is pretty substantial savings if you ask me!

review/summary: I hate kidney beans
review/text: I hate kidney beans.  Always have.  But this came in the variety pack from the same company so I had to try it, right?  Wow.  I like kidney beans.  I've read some other reviews that say this isn't spicy enough.  Well, that's why you have hot sauce and stuff, add to your own taste.  I think it's right on.  It's a great quick meal you can take with you just about anywhere.  It's great for work, you can take it with some rice and bam lunch in about two minutes.<br /><br />It does not take long to heat this item because it's already at room temperature, anything over a minute is pushing it.  I usually warm it mixed with cold rice, half full power setting, 1-1.5 minutes.<br /><br />These products do have a bit of sodium in them, so  be sure to look at the nutritional information if that's a concern for you.

review/summary: Very tasty vegan curry
review/text: The curry is a nice level of spice, all the ingredients are vegan, and proportion of beans to sauce favors the beans.  One packet is enough for a dinner for two adults (when added to rice and maybe a side vegetable).  The foil packet means the risk of spoilage is minimal.  Overall an excellent base for a spicy, tasty dinner.  It would be nice if the box was rectangular so it stacked better in the pantry.  The current folded shape makes it difficult to stack.

review/summary: Tasty sauce but needs more ingredients
review/text: This is a very tasty red bean dish.  However, straight out of the bag and into a warm bowl is too runny for me; it looks too much like tomato soup with beans in it.  It's not quite ready-to-eat for me.  I add a packet of this to two cups of cooked rice to add some filler.  It's like an Indian version of red beans and rice this way, and a very filling and satisfying meal.<br /><br />But, it's not quite as curry-laden as the butter chicken curry I tried yesterday.<br /><br />The packet says this is for two meals.  Hard to believe.  So, although it tastes good, I'm not too impressed with the value of this particular dish.

As it is, it beats just about any other shelf-stored microwave meal on the market.

review/summary: My Favorite Indian Food, Ready to Eat
review/text: I live in NYC and have access to many wonderful Indian restaurants. I love Indian food and I also make it at home (no prepared packages). This particular ready made dish is simply wonderful.<br /><br />I believe it is very close to going to an Indian restaurant. I love spicy food and if it is not spicy enough I alter it. This dish is somewhat there, not as I would normally want. My reason for liking it so much is simple, the spices and flavors are wonderful, I cannot get enough of it. When I cannot cook I come home after a long day of work, add rice and a vegetable to this packaged prepared food. I do not feel a need for meat. I am not a vegetaria, I cook with fish and no fat chicken or turkey sometimes. For me, none of this is necessary. The spices/flavor are more then good. I do not eat breakfast or lunch so having said this, most likely this packaged food with simple additions, would be fine for two people. Try it, you may like it as much as I do. I think it is more then like, just great!

review/summary: Fast and tasty indian food
review/text: For when I'm too lazy to cook properly, Kitchens of India's Rajma Masala is a nearly perfect alternative.  I just put the bag in a pot of water and boil, then pour into a small bowl and stir the contents.  It's not too spicy, and once heated I can even take the unopened bag on short trips as an alternative to fast food!<br />Unfortunately, I had to take one star off because not every bag contains the same amount of ingredients (sometimes it's a bit watery), and I should inform prospective buyers that this is made in India, not the US.  For the quality and price of each bag (about 3 dollars each), these are a good source of emergency/travel/lazy day food.

review/summary: Spicy, Flavorful and Versatile - Just Not THAT Hot!
review/text: First off, can I say that I LOVE Nando's? It's a peri-peri restaurant chain that has many branches worldwide and which I know and love as a favorite standby from the UK, but which has only a couple of branches in the US. Neither of those branches are within even a thousand miles of my home in Ohio, so my Nando's fixes are very few and far between. I love that their peri-peri sauces are available in the US, and buy them whenever I can as an all-purpose condiment to serve with anything and everything that could do with a bit of spicing up.<br /><br />Secondly... while I LOVE these sauces, even the "extra hot" version doesn't even begin to come close to some of the sauces that real chili-heads will be used to, i.e. the ones that rate so high on the Scoville scale that you're advised to only add them to your food one minuscule drip at a time. Nando's sauces are more of the "slosh generously all over your plate" variety if you have any kind of a taste and tolerance for the burny stuff, and I tend to use it more like ketchup than a genuine "hot" sauce. That's not meant as an insult to the sauces, though - don't get me wrong, I really do love them, but I get through a whole lot more of this stuff than I do the dangerously hot sauces I buy almost entirely for the burn. Nando's peri-peri sauces are just not like that; they're meant to be enjoyed for their complex flavor rather than as a challenge, so please don't buy a bottle of this stuff expecting to have your head blown off with a single taste.<br /><br />I love the Nando's Extra Hot and Hot sauces as a dip for fries and anything else that requires dunking, and it is also a firm favorite in my household when mixed liberally with a bit of mayo and/or sour cream for a spicy dipping sauce that works well with appetizers of all kinds. It works really well as a marinade for chicken, too - definitely one to try when you're grilling out.<br /><br />My only "problem" (and it's not really a problem, as such) is that I get through these little bottles far too quickly. Anyone who's ever been to a Nando's restaurant will know that customers can take as many HUGE bottles (I mean, containing maybe 2-3 pints) of peri-peri sauce in any and every strength and flavor variation back to their table to apply as freely to their meal as they wish. When I try that at home I find I've emptied a $5 bottle of sauce before I know it. I just wish they'd start making it available in stores in industrial-sized bottles for dedicated Nando-lovers such as myself!<br /><br />Finally, if you ever find yourself in a city that has a Nando's restaurant, I'd heartily recommend that you go along and try it out. Order some peri-peri chicken to suit your own personal chili tolerance level, a Portuguese or Brazilian beer and (my personal favorite) a bowl of their spicy mixed nuts to munch on while you wait for your order (these are SERIOUSLY hot and I love them so very, very much) and, well... enjoy! :)

review/summary: The preferred salt for kitchen and table
review/text: Except for baking, Morton Coarse Kosher Salt is what I use in the kitchen and at the table. I prefer pure, plain salt to the somewhat muddled flavor of sea salt. Table salt is much finer so it is harder to pinch and distribute evenly on a finished dish.<br /><br />This coarse, flaked salt is also necessary for topping pretzels and margaritas and making pickles. It is also especially nice topping whole grain loaves and on meat, poultry or baked potatoes. If you have a French recipe calling for "gros sel" something of this nature is what is intended. A nice gift that is easy to make using this salt is pickled lemons, which are very useful in Mediterranean dishes.<br /><br />Note that this salt is less dense than regular table salt. The label indicates to add 1 tablespoon per quarter cup if the recipe calls for table salt.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this sauce mix and I use it many different ways to prepare a delicious and satisfying pasta dinner. I usually use two packets for 16 ounces of penne pasta (prepared) and that ratio seems to work really well. Just add milk (I use skim) and olive oil and whisk the sauce in a small pan on the stove! I typically add minced garlic and grated Parmesan cheese as I'm cooking the sauce to thicken it and improve the taste to my satisfaction. In addition, I add prepared frozen chopped broccoli to the dish when I serve it and often grilled chicken for protein. Serve with a salad and you have a great dinner -- and very quickly!<br /><br />My last remark is that I usually pay $1.67 for each packet in the grocery store. I recommend this sauce mix to everyone!

review/summary: Okay but not really something to write home about
review/text: I'd heard a lot of raving how great the FIber Gourmet Mac'n Cheese is over on the Weight Watcher boards, and the reviews here were all glowingly positive.  So I ordered a six-pack.  Have made it twice so far, following package directions EXACTLY and ....  meh.  Yes it is much lower in calories (and I suppose in guilt) but there's not much taste there.  It does fill you up (anything loaded with fiber will, of course).  Made according to directions there's VERY little cheese flavor and the "sauce" is flat.<br /><br />I've added cheese both times I've made it to get it to taste somewhere close to "real" Mac 'n Cheese (and counted the additional points).  I'm simply not impressed with the product.  It's not horrible, but it isn't something I'm going to re-order once I get done with the other four boxes.  You'd do better with Dreamfield's pasta and your own cheese sauce made with reduced fat cheese in my opinion.

review/summary: Very tasty Mac n Cheese for health consious/ dieter
review/text: I have read about Fiber Gourmet, and specifically the Mac-mm-Cheese and I was very curious to try it out.  I mean, how good can this possibly be considering it is loaded with fiber and lower in calories.  Well, the answer to that question is pretty darn good.  In fact I just finished box number two in 3 days. The pasta has a nice al dente texture, and really tastes like pasta.  Infact, you could easily make this and not tell that picky eater that they are actually eating healthy, with all that fiber and low calories.<br />  Some people have said that they like to add cheese to this.  The first box I cooked I added a little to much milk and it made the cheese stick to the pot and not the pasta. Tonight, I did less milk,put a little smart balance, added half the cheese packet then mixed and put into two bowls. (one for me, one for the boyfriend who likes it too).  Then I split up the remainder of the cheese between the too, added a few more drops of milk, mixed, and then perfection.  No extra cheese needed because it was all on the pasta and almsot none in the pan.<br />  The price to buy direct is a little steep, because shipping is 5.99, so total cost for 6 boxes is 26.99 or 4.49 a box.  Amazon had the mac-mmm-Cheese for 6 boxes for 16.72 shipped,or 2.78 a box, so I jumped.  As soon as Amazon gets it back in stock, I am ordering.  I think I may be hooked. So if you are on the fence, just order it, you'll be glad you did.

I put it in a 9" x 13" casserole dish, put a little more WW cheese on top then bake for about 10 min. Divide it up into 1 cup containers, freeze half and put the other half in the fridge. Great for side dish or snack. Easy to make, 18 g of fiber per serving, low calorie, low fat, filling and good.

review/text: This is a very good Mac and Cheese.  I originally bought it because it has lots of fiber and less fat than other brands.  To my surprise, it actually tastes good too!  The pasta is tender when cooked for 10 minutes, and you can't notice that it has more fiber.  The cheese mix is also good.  They also give very generous portions.<br /><br />The only down side is that they could add more cheese mix.  I just add some shredded cheddar cheese and it is delicious.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.  Enjoy!

review/text: I was excited to see a reduced calorie, high-fiber mac & cheese product, and with such good reviews. Unfortunately, this has no cheese flavor to it at all. If you read the ingredient list, you'll see that cheese comes after salt - uh, what? I didn't and bought this item and will end up throwing away the sauce mix packets for the rest of them and eating the macaroni with spaghetti sauce. I think maybe the people giving this good reviews are new to healthier food and belive it is supposed to taste bad. That's just not the case - you don't have to compromise on flavor to eat healthy.

review/text: I've tried this a couple of ways...non fat soy milk not so good for the mixer, but almond milk (lower in calories, but has more fat) worked better.  This last time I threw in some cut up pieces of cauliflower as the pasta was boiling.  I got my veggies and had even more comforting food all in one pot...any veggie could work. I stir in the cheese packet a bit at a time, added a spice or two and topped with parmesan cheese, which added a bit more flavor for few calories.  Pretty good for the calories and fiber!

review/summary: My kids loved this healthy alternative mac & cheese
review/text: I have picky eaters. Mac & Cheese is a daily staple. I stumbled across this brand while trying to find a healthier alternative for my kids.<br /><br />The fiber filled macaroni is filling and the cheese sauce is tasty.  I ordered this directly from the company and was told that a production glitch caused some boxes to have extra macaroni in it.  It was recommended to measure the dry noodles before using. There should only be 6oz of dry pasta.  Both of the boxes I ordered had 8oz of pasta.  Just an FYI because cooking the extra 2oz makes the cheese sauce less cheesy since there is more pasta to cover.<br /><br />My kids deemed this their favorite mac & cheese ever.  I will be ordering more but will be comparing prices between Amazon and the manufacturer before doing so as Amazon seems to have a better price.<br /><br />I highly recommend this!!!

review/summary: Thrilled
review/text: I was thrilled to find this product and even more thrilled when it turned out to be very good.  My pantry now has a number of Fiber Gourmet pastas and it's all we use now.  Half the calories, all of the taste! We don't care for wheat pastas as they have a distinctive nutty taste so this product is the perfect solution for those counting calories.  And I don't always use the mac and cheese sauce packet.  I use the elbows for any dish that calls for them and just save the packet for a sauce later. It goes great on vegetables, so nothing is wasted.  Some of the reviews did say that this pasta comes out al dente, but I found if I cook them just a minute or so longer, they are perfect.  The sauce is a little weak and bland, but when I added a portion of Laughing Cow lite cheese, it was quite good without sending the calorie count too high.  All in all a great product.  I just wish they'd sell the flour they use with the extra fiber by itself so I could try it in baked products.

review/text: Really enjoying the FG products I've ordered. I'm a little mixed on this one, but I wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating crackers. ;)<br /><br />Macaroni:<br />Great to get so much fiber and fewer calories in a noodle that tastes just like any other. Very pleased, would have given this 5 stars had this just been macaroni. So far their pasta products have been excellent - both in taste, texture, nutrition and calories.<br /><br />Sauce packet:<br />I agree with the other reviewers, this is far from creamy and cheesy, and most of us "doctor" it to get flavor and texture. (I dare anyone to upload a photo that looks like the one on the box!) Adding cheese turns this into less of the guilt-free item I was looking for, and more of an occasional treat for us due to the saturated fat in cheese. Still, better for you due to the noodles, so not quite as taboo if you're health conscious but miss the old "blue box".<br /><br />In addition to the cheese, you can also do what you do with other products like this and toss in cooked vegetables like broccoli or fresh peas, and meats like ham or lean ground beef, turkey or chicken to make it a balanced meal.<br /><br />Happy eating! :)

This, sadly, does not make for the most sensible eating all of the time. I decided to give Fiber Gourmet a try as I have tried almost every other "healthy" noodle alternative. This was by far the best of them all!<br /><br />Not only was this tasty but I only ate a single serving. It was so filling that I did not find myself scouring the cabinets later or reheating the leftovers to finish the box as I often do with that other blue box. The mere fact that it fills me up to limit me to a single serving while still tasting so good is priceless in my book.

review/text: First of all, let me say that I have been using whey low exclusively in my iced tea, and have totally replaced sugar in my kitchen with this product for several years.  I thought is was great, and I can say that of it tastes indistiguishable from sugar.  However, a few weeks ago my 12 year old son was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.  We are supposed to count carbs in order to figure out how much insulin to give at each meal.  When we used the effective carb count that the whey low product states on its packaging to figure carbs, his blood sugar shot up immediately.  We have tried it several times with the same result.  I have to conclude that this product is making false claims about effective carbs and being a low carb product.  I won't be buying anymore.  Sorry it took me so long to find out.  It's probably why I couldn't lose weight even though I thought I was counting carbs all this time.

review/summary: Recommended only for special occasions
review/text: You've heard the saying: If it's too good to be true, it probably is...<br /><br />Well, I received my Whey Low products and made some mini vanilla cupcakes (a low-fat recipe using shredded zucchini) topped chocolate butter cream icing.  I used the Whey Low D (for diabetics) in the cupcakes and Whey Low powder for the icing.  Both products certainly performed better than Splenda (and even the Splenda for Baking sugar/splenda blend).  It looks and tastes like sugar in the cupcake recipe.  It baked up beautifully and browned nicely.  I was very pleased with the Whey Low D's performance in the cupcake.<br /><br />The Whey Low Powder at first looked like it was going to make great butter cream icing, but after spreading it on the cupcakes, it began to loosen up and turned into a thick glaze after a short while.  The taste is sweet, but the icing was grainy in texture.  Within a few hours, the icing had begun to run a bit down the sides of the cupcakes and by morning it was a wet puddle at the bottom of each cupcake.  So, it did not perform like ordinary powdered sugar in this recipe.  I think it would work fine for making a glaze or for dusting the top of a cake, but not for a real cake frosting.  Also, I would suggest eating it within a few hours of application, otherwise it will break down and be a mess.  The results were quite disappointing and only slightly better than Splenda in this type of recipe.<br /><br />The unfortunate news is that the mini cupcakes did raise my blood sugar to some degree, so you can't expect your blood sugar to not be affected.  I ate three mini cupcakes for my test, then I checked my blood every 30 minutes for about 1� hours and it went steadily up from 150 to 202.  Whey Low declares that it's 70% lower in calories than regular sugar, which may still make it a good choice for cakes and cookies over using regular sugar if you want to make a special dessert, such as a birthday cake once a year.  But I don't plan to replace Splenda in most of my cooking because of my blood sugar results.  NOTE: Ordinarily, I wouldn't have eaten three mini cupcakes in one sitting, but I did this time because I wanted to see how my blood sugar would react to a larger dose of the Whey Low in what might be a normal serving of cake (and one mini cupcake wouldn't have been large enough).<br /><br />Whey Low is not the miracle I hoped it would be, but I'm glad to know of an alternative to Splenda for baking cakes and other baked pastry sweets.  I very rarely make them, but on my birthday or at Christmas I do like to have a piece of cake and have it taste "normal."  I will reserve Whey Low for these rare, special occasions.<br /><br />Sorry folks!  I guess we still can't have our cake, eat it and not feel the effect on our hips and in our blood sugar readings.  Darn.....

review/summary: Whey Low Type "D" Granules Rating.
review/text: This is a good product and meets all of the promises expressed by the manufacturer.  I thought initially that it had the same sweetness as sugar, but for some reason I found myself using more of it than I would have used refined sugar under the same circumstances.  I don't know if it's because of the very fine granules (much finer than table sugar), or if it just wasn't really quite as sweet as table sugar; it's hard to say.  I doubt I will purchase this product again unless it comes down in price.  The price seems reasonable until you factor in shipping charges and, again, the fact that it goes so quickly. I purchased a 1 lb. bag and it only lasted for about 10 days. The same amount in table sugar would have lasted a month or longer! I got it to bake with and to use in my coffee but it went so fast I never got the a chance to bake with it!  I have used Suzanne Somers' "Somer Sweet", made from a Chinese fruit, so it's a safe artificial sweetener and it's 5 times sweeter than sugar.  I found it to be much more cost-effective than the whey low because the price is comparable but it lasts a very long time.  I went back to that for my coffee.  I have not baked with that product yet, although the manufacturer says that it works beautifully in baking.  Hope this helps.

review/summary: Good Cane Sugar Substitute
review/text: I ordered Whey Low D as I am looking for something to substitute for the regular sugar sold in supermarkets.  I've tried stevia and suffered digestive upset and also found it to be way too sweet, regardless of how little I used.<br /><br />The reason for ordering Whey Low D is that my mother is a diabetic and I wanted to give this a test run before recommending that she try it.  I found this to be the same as regular sugar in taste, and all in all was quite pleased with the product--except for the price, that is.<br /><br />But after reading some reviews from diabetics regarding how their blood sugar shot up even after using this has given me pause in purchasing some for my mom.  She does miss her sweets (wouldn't we all?) and sometimes cheats, resulting in a 200+ reading.  I think I will hold off getting this for her until more information is available about its effect on diabetics.<br /><br />If you are not concerned about the carbs it contains, I do recommend this as a much better substitute for cane sugar, especially as opposed to Splenda, Aspartame and the other questionable products available on the shelves of your "regular" supermarkets.

review/summary: Whey Low Sugar substitute from the Whey Low website
review/text: I read the reviews for this sugar substitute, and I need to clarify a few things. I purchased it from Whole Foods Market first. I wanted to try this product out first, and I was greatly pleased. It is expensive, so I went to the actual website and purchased the packets. The cost is a little cheaper, and I do want to inform others that there are 2 types of Whey sugar substitute. There is one that is specific for consumers that are Diabetic, and then the form for those of us that are not. If you are Diabetic and use the regular form, I am sure your blood sugar level will increase. I saw that some of the other sites that sell this product, did not specify availability for the Diabetic and non-diabetic consumer. This is an important thing that needs to be made, because a lot of the negative reviews had to do with this situation. So it needs to be made clear that there are 2 forms that are available. I have never tried the type for diabetics, so I cannot state how good or bad it tastes. I love it, and it tastes better than ALL the other sugar substitutes that I have tried. I ordered the packets, and they arrived yesterday. I plan on sending a few to friends, to let them see how good it is. [...]

review/summary: ****WARINING******** IS THIS THE REAL WHEY LOW??
review/text: Hi!  I came across some negative reviews of Whey Low and was so upset because I absolutely LOVE this product.  All of it, the brown, the powdered, the granular.  ALL OF IT.  However, after I checked I see that this sugar sold by BarryFarms seems to be a fake or an imposter.  I personally have never used the stuff sold by this company so I can't say for sure how it works BUT, so many of you said how much you hated it that I can only believe that you have not used the real thing.  I suggest that you try out the product from Vivalac and there website is wheylow dot com.  PLEASE give it a shot.  It cooks and tastes just like all of your regular sugar, even the brown.  I make baked goods and candies so I've experimented with temperatures and all of that.  It does tend to cook a bit faster but that is all.  My dad has type 2 diabetes and uses the Type D and the granular sometimes and it doesn't spike his blood sugar.  I just want everyone to be informed!  Good Luck!

review/summary: BEST MINTS EVER!
review/text: This is the best tasting mint that exists. It contains a dental hygienic ingredient as well so I feel I am helping my teeth and gums stay health while these mints are in my mouth. They are so hard to find. I used to have a steady supply of these mints and I admit I became addicted to them.  They are strong but not so strong that you are repelled. It tastes like a clean mint. There is no yucky aftertaste. It just leaves your mouth minty and fresh tasting like you just brushed your teeth and rinsed. I am so extremely disappointed I can't just go down to Walgreens and buy it anymore. It does contain a small amount of cottonseed oil similar to an ingredient in Cisco but it isn't like you are aware of it. It isn't a transfat by the way. I don't know why we cant find it. Is the company going out of business? Are we having issues with trade? Anyway, absolutely NO other mint compares to this one. Believe me I have tried all of them. Cries out: "Come back, Smints! Come back!!!"

I love the price on Amazon (when they are available) and I stock up when I can get them here.<br /><br />They are strong mints and really knock out any bad taste in my mouth fast. And I love that they don't contain sugar. The box is small and fits perfectly in my pocket. I'll keep purchasing them as long as they are around! When I can't find Smints, the sugar free Altoids are also good.<br /><br />My friends know I always have some type of mint on me.  When they first try a Smint, they can't believe how strong they are and they make a face.  But, they always end up coming back for more.  They are very tasty and they really work to freshen breath.

review/summary: Good biscuits, not french bread
review/text: I bought this case of Gluten-Free Pantry Country French Bread mix because I have not had french bread in a long, long time.  I know french bread and this, ladies and gentlemen, is not french bread.  If made per the instructions it is a lot more like a loaf of biscuit.<br /><br />The bad part is that it is nothing remotely like french bread.  The good part is that if formed right, it makes pretty good biscuits.  Really, they are pretty good biscuits.  I make drop biscuits and put an egg ring around them to keep them from spreading too much.  Then I bake them on a pan (I only make a quarter of the mix at a time...the biscuits do not store well once cooked) and presto, biscuits.<br /><br />Calling it french bread is like calling a cat a dog.<br /><br />Richard

review/text: This bread mix is by far my favorite. I have found that to get a true "french bread" experience, you have to use a baguette pan, which cooks it to the right consistency. Where it doesn't duplicate a crusty loaf tucked under your arm in paris, this is as good as it gets for us gluten-free folk, as far as I'm concerned.

review/summary: EXCELLENT GLUTEN FREE PIZZA CRUST!!!!
review/text: Okay, I have tried about 10 different recipes/ packages for gluten-free pizza and this is the best one I have ever tasted!  I have no gluten intolerance, but bake gluten free for my husband, so you can trust me when I say that this mix is GOOD.  I hate anything with that gritty, strong flavored aftertaste that is so common with gluten free products.  I do lots of experimenting to get the best flavor and texture whenever I bake gluten free.  So, when I read that people didn't think this bread had any flavor, I checked the ingredients you are supposed to add to it and made some changes.  When I bake regular pizza crust I only use olive oil, so I substituted the veg. oil or butter for olive oil which gave it a real "pizza crust" taste.  I also added a full teaspoon of salt instead of a half.  With these changes, the crust came out delicious!  I spread the frosting-like batter onto my pizza stone and baked it for 10 minutes before adding the toppings.  Be sure to oil and use cornmeal on the stone first.  I'm telling you, give this mix a chance if you want to eat a delicious pizza again!  Crispy on the bottom, chewy in the middle!  Use exact measurements and you should be fine!  I didn't let mine rise very long either and it was perfect!

review/summary: mostly great
review/text: I've been GF for over 20 years, and this is the best GF bread mix I have found.  It works very well with my Breadman bread machine set to Super Rapid.  This is not what you may think of as exactly French Bread - really hard crust with a crumbly interior.  But, it does come pretty close!  I find that it helps if you cut it when the loaf is slightly warm.  It toasts wonderfully and holds up pretty well.<br />I've used this bread mix to make Thanksgiving stuffing for the past two years and it works very well for that.  The trick there is to cut up the bread and let it stale for a few hours up to a day so it holds its form and doesn't collapse into a ball of starch.<br />This mix also makes a pretty darn good pizza crust.  It is EXTREMELY sticky, but it is worth it.  My recommendation there is to spread half of the mix (freeze the other - this makes a LOT of pizza!) onto a nonstick baking mat with a spatula until the crust is pretty thin, then to bake it until it just turns golden, and only then to top it.  Otherwise, the toppings will get too cooked and the inside will still be foamy.<br />I would rate the pizza aspect as 5 stars and the bread as 4.

review/summary: Easy to make, delicious, and great for sandwiches
review/text: I'm not a big fan of sandwiches as a general category of lunch options. If given the option, and someone else is cooking, I'll eat something--really almost anything--else. The main exception to this is the old childhood classic, the peanut-butter and jelly sandwich. I haven't had a good PBJ in YEARS, something I'm sure most of you can probably sympathize with. The primary "pro" that I have for this bread is that it makes wonderful PBJs. I'll admit, it's not like the kind Mom would make us on that chewy, wonderful, Home Pride bread. But it still does make good PBJs.<br /><br />The process for making the bread was fairly simple. One loaf pan, my stand mixer, a couple extra wet ingredients, and basically mix it all together. The dough is REALLY sticky, so if you have a helper available to hold the bowl up while you scrape the dough into the loaf pan, you'll probably enjoy the whole process a little more. I did it by myself and it was doable. It's the only part of the process that was even remotely frustrating. The dough, aside from its stickiness, is actually fairly easy to handle if you're used to handling sticky dough--just use the cold water trick where you dip your fingers in cold water before the touching the dough. It works like a charm with this bread, and the few drops of water that are left behind on the dough don't hurt a thing.<br /><br />It did rise a little more slowly than the box said it would. I let it go for a full hour before it rose to the top of the pan, rather than the 40 minutes it says on the box. I can imagine that if you don't give it whatever time it needs to reach the top of the pan, you probably will get a dense a brick of yuckiness instead of bread. (Also, don't forget to add the salt to the recipe--if you do, this will have no flavor, which is par for course with bread-baking, gluten-free or not).<br /><br />After it came out of the oven I removed it from its pan and let it rest on top of an overturned cake pan so it could cool. I let it cool for about twenty minutes or so before we cut into it. We just cut off a few slices to go with dinner, and left the rest of the loaf whole until later. It made great garlic bread, and the crust on the bread is yummy and interesting. The bread itself does have kind of a biscuit texture, but I love biscuits so this was kind of a feature for me.<br /><br />Saying it has a "biscuit texture" is a little misleading, however. This bread does hold up quite well in ways that biscuits sometimes don't. After the loaf had cooled all the way, we sliced it up and wrapped pairs of slices for sandwiches in plastic wrap. We put these wrapped pairs into ziploc bags, and put one set into the freezer, one into the fridge, and one on the counter so we could see how they keep. I also made a PBJ that night, ate half, and put the other half in a sandwich bag on the counter to see how it would hold up in a lunch bag. So far they're all working out great. The frozen bread did need to be zapped in the microwave for about 15 second before the two slices would come apart. After that I put them in the toaster for breakfast. They probably need longer in the toaster from frozen than you might think. I put them on the same setting I use for frozen waffles, and they didn't get very toasty. But they didn't fall apart either, and they still taste great.<br /><br />The countertop and refrigerator bread slices also worked out well. I made grilled cheese last night, and that worked out very nicely, even dipping it into tomato soup. It does have an interesting (in a good way) texture, so it's not exactly like the grilled cheese you might remember from childhood. But it is tasty nonetheless. I also sliced up a leftover porkchop and made myself a porkchop sandwich piled high with meat. The sandwich didn't fall apart. It had the usual amount of crumbs, what you would expect from regular bread. And you know that porkchops, no matter how succulent they were fresh, tend to get tough in the fridge. The sandwich was great.<br /><br />The leftover PBJ was also still great in the morning. The bread did kind of soak up some of the jam, the way regular bread does, but it didn't fall apart, even with the added moisture. The texture still held up as well.<br /><br />And to be thorough in my experiment, I had my husband eat some as garlic bread that first night, and he also had a grilled cheese sandwich with me. He doesn't have to eat gluten free, so he still knows what real bread is like. He agreed that it was a different texture than regular bread, but that he also really liked it. I'll definitely be making this again.

review/text: I haven't tried to make bread with this yet,  but I am very happy with the pizza it makes.  The dough/batter is a bit sticky to handle, but oiling your hands makes it work OK.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free White Bread Mix
review/text: Although I would never confuse this bread with the real French Bread, it is by far, the best gluten free white bread that I have made - from mixes as well as from scratch.  The mix is milk free - wonderful for those of us who have to avoid milk products. The texture of the bread is very close to traditional white bread made from wheat and does not become "grainy" even after several days in the freezer.  I think it it's easy to make, whether by traditional oven method or in a bread machine.  One of the very few bread mixes I highly recommend.

review/summary: Not french bread - but super tasty
review/text: I bought the mix in hopes that I could create a bread for myself to use at Easter dinner.  It does not taste like french bread but it does taste better than any gluten free bread that I have bought.  It can be sliced thick or thin and it makes great french toast, sandwiches, garlic bread...you get the picture.  It was not hard to make, though I did let it rise for too long which meant that it came spilling out of my loaf pan.  I did not have time to dig out my breadmaker, but if it has a gluten free setting, I will be ordering this fantastic stuff by the case!!

review/summary: Great French Bread Rolls
review/text: I was surprised at the "biscuit" review because I found this mix does make a great french bread. I don't have a baguette pan, so I used a mini-loaf pan (sort of like a muffin tin but with rectangular cups instead of round ones) and whatever didn't fit in that pan I put into a small regular bread loaf pan. I had family coming in from out of town, so I made a great GF minestrone from fresh ingredients + Sam's Mills shell pasta and served it with one package of this mix. I had to make the mix with oil and water, not butter and milk, because I have a dairy-sensitive son. Perhaps that makes the difference between a french-bread texture and a biscuit texture? In any case, EVERYONE loved it. It was enough to feed 9 people and still have a little left over the next morning to make french bread for the GF family members (I let the non-GF family members eat cereal for breakfast!!).<br /><br />About half our family eats gluten-free and the other half doesn't. Everyone enjoyed the bread equally, including my nieces's boyfriend who had never eaten any gluten-free bread before and was surprised that he liked it just as well as a regular fresh-from-the-oven french roll.<br /><br />I would definitely make half a mix or less if it were just my family eating it, because I'm sure it's like every other GF bread mix in that it probably doesn't keep well for more than a day.

review/summary: Finally...great GF bread!
review/text: This bread actually tastes like...bread!  That is a change after the other GF breads I've tried.  I'm excited to try more from this line.  Now, I'll admit, the appearance of this bread is nothing like a loaf of french bread, but the texture actually is pretty close.  I was a little doubtful it would taste that good due to the looks of it, but after a bite I decided that looks just aren't that important when it tastes like this!

review/summary: Best mix so far!
review/text: Highly recommend this French bread for untoasted sandwiches, or toasted, it's great! I'm rather new at making GF bread, have been using the GF Pantry Favorite Sandwich bread which is ok but rather "cakey". Tried this and it's wonderful, so much more like regular bread. I agree that it's not really like French bread, although when toasted it's pretty close, but the color, texture and taste are the best so far (with Bob's Red Mill being the worst I've tried). Have ordered the package of 6, and am awaiting my order of Pamela's and will compare that as well!

review/summary: Excellent, white sandwich bread!
review/text: I need to make this bread without eggs or milk.  Using water, egg replacer, and following the directions, the bread it OK.  It is sour and doesn't have much taste.  I experimented.  I now use twice as much vinegar, twice as much honey, natural almond milk in place of the water, and I brush the surface of the dough, once it has risen, with virgin olive oil.  The result is magnificent!  It makes a creamy, very white loaf with a nice crust.  The look and feel of the cut bread is just like... bread!  Yay!  The sliced bread holds up to sandwich dressings and fillings.  It is very important to follow the instructions to let the bread cool completely, then slice it and freeze the slices.  I wrap each slice in waxed paper, then put them in a freezer bag.  If you don't want a toasted sandwich, just take the slices out of the freezer and leave them on the kitchen counter, at room temperature, for 20 minutes or so, and you have fresh bread.  You can also put the frozen slices in the toaster if you are in a hurry. This product is a big success!  Just to be complete, I use a Sante cast iron loaf pan, and I find 40 minutes at 375 degrees is just perfect.  Good luck!

review/summary: Bread, at last!!
review/text: It was four years ago this weekend we discovered my partner has celiac disease.  He has suffered greatly without bread.  This is the first bread mix I have found that does not contain soy or flax, both things are allergens for him.  The mix is easy to put together and bakes beautifully.  It even smells like real bread when it is in the over.  The texture is smooth with few big air holes.  It makes great toast ( except that it takes longer to toast the actual wheat based bread) and great grilled sandwiches. It tends to fall apart when you make something like a chicken salad sanwich without grilling, but the flavor makes that a negligible minus.  All in all great product.

review/summary: Great GF Bread
review/text: While the texture isn't exactly like real french bread, this bread mix makes a really good tasting gluten free load of bread.  I followed the directions exactly (using the melted butter and sugar) and really enjoyed it.  It's crusty on the outside and soft on the inside w/ no icky gluten free aftertaste.  It's not gritty like most gf breads are either.  I probably wouldn't use this as a pizza crust but for a nice loaf of bread - I'll def make this again.  It does have a hint of the french bread taste but it's not exact and don't expect it to be.  Some people who try these mixes crack me up because they get all upset when it's not exactly like a gluten filled product.  This is probably as close as you can get with a pre made mix and it's easy to make, too!

review/summary: Better be hungry for pizza!
review/text: Be sure you're hungry for pizza. It will make a large cookie sheet sized crust or 2 round crusts. Directions are very vague. Just use your instincts and it works fine. Haven't tried it as French bread yet, but I'm guessing it will make several loaves. Tastes pretty much like the Glutino Favorite Sandwich Bread - like potato bread. Works well. Good price on Subscribe & Save.

review/summary: Great pizza crust
review/text: This was pleasantly surprising. Ordered a case from Amazon the day after trying it for the first time. Makes great bread sticks, a decent french bread loaf, and a pizza crust reminiscent of what we had in Italy. (That's all I've tried so far.) I accidentally added salt twice to the pizza crust, and found it improved the flavor, which I think is a little flat. It works fine in a bread machine without a GF option, tho' it is stickier than other mixes I've used.

review/summary: The best GF bread I have had yet!
review/text: Let's face it, most GF bread is disgusting!  Who wants to eat something you have to nuke or toast to eat it and it still is awful?  Not this bread.  Very easy to make (although my rising time is a lot longer than 40 minutes).  I cut the bread thin to make sandwiches.  The only drawback is the bread is crumbly.  The taste more than makes up for this.

review/text: This is my favorite type of bread to make.  I'm allergic to gluten/dairy/eggs so I have to make my own bread unless I want to pay a ton of money for pre-made bread in stores that usually tastes awful anyway.  I use the mix with oil instead of butter and EnerG egg replacer and it turns out amazing.

Many of the gluten free recipes I have tried with this are awesome.  I have not made the actual bread from the mix.  More reasonable to buy it from AMazon that the grocery stores.

review/summary: Best by far
review/text: This bread mix is by far the easiest I have found to work with.  It rises nicely, bakes nicely and is softer longer after baking.  It is a little crumbly past 3 days, but I split the loaf in half and freeze part for use the next week.  Comes out just fine after thawing as well.  Nice flavor, doesn't interfere with sandwich items.  Highly recommend you try it.
