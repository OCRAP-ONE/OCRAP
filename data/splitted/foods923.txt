review/text: This is a delicious, distinctive tasting tea with a wonderful scent. It even has a nice, rich red color. There are a lot of cinnamon-based spiced teas on the market, but this one is my favorite because it has more sophistication and depth to it. Highly recommended.

review/text: What a wonderful deep rich flavor !  Never really being a tea drinker, I started having cups of tea when I started having headaches....I lost my taste for coffee. This was my first attempt at drinking different flavors of loose tea since store shelf bagged tea was nothing special......it opened a new world of healthy , delicious , flavorful drinking.  The Cinnamon Plum is absolutely bursting with scent and flavor and has become my favorite. A friend gave me a tea brewer for Christmas and I now have an assortment of Rishi teas...all of which have a special way of being brewed. Besides being healthy , tasting different teas has become an interesting past time.

review/summary: pretty good but...
review/text: I've purchased this tea from Rishi a couple of times, not from Amazon.  I'm not the biggest fan of herbal teas but I think this one is pretty good.  My only complaint is that I can detect a hint of moldy taste which is a bit of a turn-off.  This wasn't a one time occurrence but happened with two different orders received months apart.  So if you have sensitive taste buds or are sensitive to odors then be aware you may notice this.

review/summary: Awesome food
review/text: My dog is a catahoula bulldog. He is 5 months old and loves this food. He does not like the canned version :-( When I got our puppy 5 months ago I did a lot of research online and found this website where they rated all sorts of dog foods. Chicken Soup was one of the best foods for this price range. It has very good ingredients. It is important that the first ingredients are meat and not meat by products. Our puppy is healthy and has very nice smooth and shiny fur.I think it is a little expensive and I can only find it online but these are the only negatives about this product. I love the size of the pebbles. They can also be used for treats.

review/summary: The only Papad to buy.
review/text: We stumbled upon these on Amazon after our local Indian restaurant closed.  They are the same as we used to get when eating out.  They used to call them "papadoms".  This is a big quantity (20 packages of about 12 to 15 or so in each) but we freeze them, so they last a long, long time.  Amazon's price is less than $1.40 a package, which is a bargain.<br /><br />The restaurant would cook them in a hot broiler and occasionally deep-fry them, but I like them best microwaved.  Only about 20 seconds or so on each side, until they bubble and get crispy.  If there are any flat or uncooked areas, microwave them again for another 10 seconds or so.<br /><br />Black pepper style is the best and has a little zip to it, we often eat them with salsa, (like a tortilla-chip).<br />Great with a cold beer.

review/summary: Dangerously addictive
review/text: If you ever go to an Indian restaurant with me, order your own papadams (English spellings vary). Once these delicious wafers get to the table, I suddenly become sharing-impaired.<br /><br />You've certainly seen them at Indian restaurants. They're the saucer-sized crispy wafers. Thin, crunchy, and often seasoned with big flavors (black pepper, cumin, garlic, or chilis, to name a few), these call to mind some Western crispy snacks, all of which pale in comparison. Made with bean flour, these offer a bit of protein with their crunch, but without a bean-y flavor. And, if it matters, you don't have to be a chemist to pronounce any of the ingredients.<br /><br />I've had a few flavors in the Lijjat line, including plain. I've had other brands, too, but this is the one I keep coming back to. These can be cooked many ways, including frying or toasting over an open flame - but a stack of three in the microwave for a minute come out very nearly as good, and with fewer calories than you might expect. Each package contains about 15 wafers, so the 20-pack is only for large families or the truly fanatical. If you can't get to an Indian grocer, though, consider splitting with some friends. They'd better be good friends, though, because sharing is a real problem.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised
review/text: Having had a few store-bought papad and been sorely disappointed I wasn't expecting much.  When I got the package and found limp, tortilla-like disks I was a bit disheartened.  However, pop them in the oven at 350 for just a few minutes and they come out hot and cool slightly to a proper crispy texture.  The only downside is this is a huge number to eat, but the expiration date was a full eight months from when I received them and another reviewer claims to freeze them.  The pepper flavor is nice and bold, pairing well with a strong curry.  I look forward to trying a few other flavors, Lijjat is definitely legit!

review/text: These are a perfect accompaniment to Indian fare. They add a nice crisp texture to the mix. This black pepper flavor is surprisingly zippy, in a good way. They are also nice to have on hand for healthy snacking. I sent a pack to our vegan daughter in college.<br /><br />Just pop one in the microwave for 20-30 seconds, watching carefully. They transform from a flat sheet to a crispy lunar landscape. As soon as the entire disk has puffed, its done. Any longer and it will burn.

review/text: Hi, this is good food ! I received the "red pepper" papad instead of the black pepper. The "red pepper" has a very smooth texture to the papad (as does the garlic) which is not my preference. The "pack of 20" was wherehoused for a while and the packaging is not as aesthetically nice as you may find in your local ethnic market. I live in a rural area and Amazon helps me enjoy the food I have come to love !

review/text: Yeah, I don't know how it is possible either, but it is. These are as good as most indian restaurants and are crispy out of the microwave in about 20-25 seconds per side, or 3~ minutes in the oven @ 400. Amazingly tasty and cheap. Great with chutney, those little onions, curries, dahls, etc. Will order more the instant they are back in stock. One of my greatest finds of all time.

review/summary: Delightful, Tasty, Healthy Tea for Digestive Support...Superb!
review/text: *****<br /><br />This Lemon Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is for easing occasional indigestion and gas, and for enhancing circulation. It's a delightful, all natural tea made from ginger root, lemon grass, lemon peel, licorice root, black pepper, peppermint leaf, natural lemon flavor, ascorbic acid, and natural licorice flavor. Most of the ingredients are organic. The taste is lemony, peppery, slightly herby and a little sweet, very nice anytime, but especially after a meal. It's a very unique tea that is a true treat.<br /><br />This is my second Yogi Tea to taste and review, and I am definitely impressed with the tea and the company. Lemon Ginger Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Lemon Ginger tea is a special healing formula designed to aid digestion, ease upset stomach and provide a caffeine-free pick-me-up. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used for centuries to treat minor stomach ailments, warm the metabolism and reduce nausea associated with motion. Ayurvedic practitioners have historically regarded Ginger as the "universal medicine" because of the way it catalyzes the benefits of other medicinal herbs. The World Health Organization (1999) reports that Ginger stimulates the appetite and can be useful in a wide variety of stomach complaints. Made with Organic Ginger, this blend is formulated to boost digestion and circulation. The sourness of Lemon promotes the secretion of digestive juices and provides the perfect counterpart to the pungent-sweet taste of Ginger. Our formula is augmented with Organic Licorice, to support the adrenals and enhance the effectiveness of other healing herbs; Organic Peppermint, to help with digestion and reduce gas; and Organic Black Pepper, a powerful detoxifier. For centuries, Lemon and Ginger have been used together for their complementary tastes and healing properties. Enjoy a cup of Lemon Ginger tea when your tummy needs a little taming, when you need to reinvigorate your body and mind, or when you just want a delicious healthy drink."<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal. Note that Yogi Tea also makes a Green Tea Lemon Ginger that is mostly a green tea and that includes caffeine; the packaging looks a little similar, so make sure you're getting the tea that you want.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****

It is especially great for colds & cough. I even give it to my 3 year old when she is sick. My husband was initially concerned about giving it to her, but I showed him that it has all natural ingredients...pretty much the same ingredients I'd use to make her a homemade concoction, and I really don't steep it for too long in hers, making it milder (along with honey). I don't believe in using medicines too much, and so I'm always looking out for naturally curable alternatives for any kind of sickness. Needless to say that I get these boxes shipped on a bi-monthly basis.

I like my tea with milk, but this tea bag is best without any milk.  Also, the color is light so if you add milk, it turns white and dilutes the flavor.  I highly recommend this tea if you have a slight upset stomach-it is soothing.

review/text: I believe your company has pulled a bait and switch as it regards the Callabaut chocolate cocoa powder, which you sell, versus the Callabaut Baking Cocoa Powder, which you do not sell.  I believe the same regarding the 1 pound Valrhona Chocolate Cocoa Powder, which you sell, versus Valrhona Cocoa Powder which you do not sell.  It is deceptive that you added the word chocolate after the brand name and sell to customers a product that is not the genuine product.  I just today opened my order of one of each of your products and found them to be of such low quality in a triple blind tasting with three tasters that I had to research what was wrong.  It wasn't until I went to the manufacturers' websites that I found the genuine products do not come packaged in one pound sizes, the size of your products.  It was my intention to purchase the Cook's Illustrated magazine's top rated cocoa powder, Callabaut. And try the highly recommended Valrhona cocoa powder.  The Valrhona product I purchased from your company was agreed by all three tasters to have an off taste that was chemically and unpalatable.  The Callabaut lacks richness, and other than its color, tastes nothing close to what one would define as chocolate in flavor.<br /><br />I am unhappy that I do not have the products I was so looking forward to receiving, and further I am quite put out that I now have to take my time to deal with returning your substandard products and wait to receive what I really thought I was ordering.  But one learns from experience, and I now know to deal only with the true manufacturer.

The closest to this cocoa powder is Droste Cocoa. I wish it was more cost effective. The actual cocoa isn't too expensive but the shipping is-even with Amazon Prime- and it makes it a cocoa I will probably not purchase again. I would have given this cocoa 5* and purchased it regularly except for the price. But if cost isn't a concern, this is your best bet.

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: I love this syrup.  What I like about it best is that it combines both agave and vanilla together thereby not having to deal with buying the raw vanilla separately, which can expensive, or blending agave with vanilla powder, which can be hard and even impossible depending on how you are using it.  Best of all, the taste is awesome.  Very delicious and easy to use.  A real winner for me.

review/summary: Super stuff!
review/text: I will add my kudos. When I opened my first bottle I was not really expecting much. Instead, I was greated by a delicous aroma, followed by a taste of wonderfully sweet, vanilla agave. As the other reviewers noted, this is not just agave syrup with some vanilla extract tossed in: you can see the specks of vanilla bean. I quickly used it in my fat-free ice cream recipe: very good indeed! (next time, however, I will use only the vanilla agave, and ignore putting in any vanilla extract which causes some bitter after-taste).<br /><br />I have given five stars to all three products made by this company. Check out the chocoagave and the 'bold roast' chocoagave.

review/text: This vanilla agave is perfect for recipes, smoothies, or even as a topping. This is *not* just agave with vanilla extract or flavorings. This is the real deal, with ground vanilla (vanilla powder) mixed into the syrup. The flecks not only look gorgeous, but they taste better than an extract. Definitely try this agave.

review/text: The 6-count of tubes of 30 is misleading here on Amazon. It says it's 55 cents per piece at $16.51 for 30 pieces. On the seller's site, it explains that it's for six tubes, or 180 pieces for $16.51, which makes it 9 cents per piece. Amazon needs to fix that listing.<br /><br />The single 30-count tube is twice as much as other suppliers (tho this has free super saver shipping), and the blister packs are a better price, and still small enough to carry around.  I only wanted one tube, to refill later on.

review/text: What better way is there to end a busy day; or to invite peaceful sleep; or to nurse a headache or a tummy-ache; or to calm frazzled nerves ~ than with a lovely cup of chamomile tea?  And there is no better chamomile tea than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPXCA">Octavia Tea Organic Calming Chamomile Caffeine-Free Herbal Tea, Loose Tea, 1.62-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>!<br /><br />I recently acquired  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LNOPSG">The Breville One-Touch Tea Maker</a> which is a brilliant way to prepare loose tea. This Octavia chamomile tea when brewed in the Breville is extraordinary and I don't think I'll ever be able to drink an herbal tea from a tea bag again! I've been so spoiled between this exquisite tea and my Breville tea kettle!<br /><br />So often when drinking chamomile tea from a tea bag I am so disappointed.  The tea tastes like lawn clippings and I wonder if that dusty looking stuff inside the teabag is really true chamomile.  There is no doubting with Octavia ~ this tea is beautiful!  It is a tin filled with lovely whole chamomile blossoms, sprinkled with lavender flowers and spearmint leaves.  They are all 100% organic, fresh and fragrant.  They bloom as they steep creating an infusion that is incredible!  There is nothing finer than enjoying a cup of this delightful tea in a bone china tea cup, just as I am right now.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPXCA">Octavia Tea Organic Calming Chamomile Caffeine-Free Herbal Tea, Loose Tea, 1.62-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a> is an exceptional value here at Amazon as well.  The 2-tin pack should last a good while too, inasmuch as these wonderful Octavia teas can be re-brewed several times. I am so happy to have found this wonderful, wonderful organic chamomile tea!

review/text: My son has a Gluten allergy and we've tried many brands and recipes for cookies but they all fell short. King Arthur brand is the BEST we've found. Just add a few wet ingredients, chocolate chips and/or dried fruits, nuts, etc. These were SO easy to make and they bake up looking like a cookie! If you take them out of the oven early, they're nice and soft. Or, you can leave them in the oven a bit longer and they're nice and crunchy! As for the taste, they're delicious and those who don't eat Gluten Free didn't notice! They're sweet but not too sweet, and the consistency is just right--they don't crumble to bits! If you're eating Gluten Free you know how hard it is to find the right consistency and that can make many Gluten Free foods unpalatable!<br /><br />I highly recommend the King Arthur brand Cookie Mix! Enjoy!

review/text: Just brought home a young APBT from the human society. He's lovely and wants to learn, but finding treats that grabbed his attention was difficult.<br /><br />Bottom line is he goes NUTS for these. I'm working with him to get over triggers he has while we're out for walks. Mostly going insane around other dogs and crying, yelping, and eventually full on barking with serious leash tugging. I'm invisible when he goes into this freakout state, however with a little work the treats grab his attention and bring the focus back to me. I expect within a few months to have him totally over this problem, and I'm relieved to find a treat that can help get him over this problem with lots of diligent training.<br /><br />Thanks Tillman you beautiful skateboarding pooch!!!

I bought a couple packs of them. The bag that they come in is resealable. So I carry the bag in my waist pack so I can quickly reward my dog for wanted behavior.<br /><br />I cut my package of Natural Balance Training tips into 152 smaller squares.

Oh I forgot to mention that I have 2 small puppies, who are morkie and maltese. They are finicky eaters. They eat this Natural Balance treat but just one piece and turn their faces away. However, when I show them just the package of wellness treat, they sit even before I tell them to. They both go crazy when they just smell the wellness treat from far away.<br />Goodluck!

review/summary: My Dog likes Natural Balance Training tips.
review/text: My dog likes the Natural Balance training tips. They are moist yet break a part if needed. I cut each square into four parts. Though lately I've just started to tear off a bit for training. My dog likes these training tips as long as I don't give him them every day. So I also give him another jerky treat some of the time. I don't rely only on food training treats to train. I also use a tennis ball as he likes the balls usually more than the food treats.<br />I've just ordered two Kong rubber non-toxic balls for my dog as the felt on the tennis balls can hold onto abrasive debris. The Natural Balance Training tips are my dog's favorite food treat more than any of the others I've tried. He likes the chicken and beef the most.

review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/summary: Great flavored tea
review/text: This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift. I also think the price is a bit steep for teabags. I just couldn't find this flavor in supermarkets, so I had to get it online.

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

Reading about possible ways to off-set liver damage 2/2 medications (statins in particular), I figured, why not--I drink tea, so I can try this one. It tastes ok. Not great. But drinkable.<br />I think this tea is a fair alternative to taking another pill.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!
