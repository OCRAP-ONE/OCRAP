review/summary: Wow...taste like gluten containing brownies!
review/text: We are new to the Gluten Free world as my daughter was diagnosed with Celiac about a month ago.  After several disappointing products, we pretty much decided just to stick with foods that are naturally gluten free.  The breads and baked goods had been just awful!  I bought these with subscribe and save thinking I would need something gluten free and quick just to have on hand.  I made the first "test" batch tonight.<br /><br />My changes:<br />Used 3 eggs instead of 2 (there wasn't enough liquid to incorporate the powdery mix otherwise).<br />I baked for only about 25 minutes (checked at 20 and again at 25 and toothpick came out clean the 2nd time).<br /><br />I am thrilled...about 1/2 the price of the other mixes we have tried and they taste great!  No stomach issues either and since the the mix is made in a gluten free facility and advertised as gluten free by a reputable company, I highly doubt it actually contains gluten as other reviewers had suggested.<br /><br />Now we can't wait to try the cookies and cakes!<br /><br />Hopefully as gf becomes more mainstream more delicious and inexpensive products will become available.

review/summary: Makes even better chocolate cookies
review/text: Kudo's to Betty Crocker for taking on gluten free!  This is a fabulous formulation, much better than what I've  tried to duplicate from scratch, and maybe the best gf brownie mix yet...  I've converted the box recipe to make chewy chocolate cookies, which is even better than the brownies!  My family prefers these cookies to any other regular cookies they can have.  WOW.<br /><br />Make up the recipe as directed on the box, but let the batter sit for 15-30 minutes to dissolve the sugar granules.  Preheat oven to 350.  Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.<br /><br />Use a cookie scoop to drop dough onto lined cookie sheets, leaving plenty of room to spread out--about 2" between cookies.  (A small scoop will make about 20 cookies, a medium scoop will make about 12 cookies)<br /><br />Bake 1 sheet at a time in 350 oven for about 12-13 minutes for small size, 15 minutes for medium size  The cookies will be flat and shiny, but set.<br /><br />Remove from oven and cool for several minutes on cookie sheet so the cookie can harden and set up, and not fall apart when removed with a spatula.  They will retain their shape if left to cool on a flat surface.<br /><br />These make rich chocolate cookies that are crisp around the edges, but incredibly chewy and soft in the centers.  I've tried chilling the dough to see if it will bake up more "fluffy", but they still flatten out quite a bit.<br /><br />*The cookie can be used as the cookie in ice cream sandwiches as well, but I think they are better assembled and eaten immediately, unfrozen, rather than made up in advance and frozen to firm up the ice cream.

review/text: Love this product and I'm not even gluten-free! I saw it and wondered if it tasted as good as regular brownie mix and wonder of wonders-- it tastes better. Trader Joe's gf brownies don't compare. I also LOVE that it doesn't have a lanudry list of ingredients. Betty Crocker keeps it simple and keeps it good, which is a nice surprise. Stock up, chocoholics!

review/text: Delighted to have found a GF brownie mix - only it got us sick as you get with a typical gluten allergic reaction.  Ate a brownie at 10 am, was sick at 11, bloated, gut pain.  Didn't realize it was the brownies - ate another and the same thing until i had a full blown colitis attack on top of the pain.  My husband who is NOT allergic to gluten had the same reaction.  There is something seriously wrong with this product.

review/summary: Absolutely Delicious!
review/text: I loved the Brownies!<br /><br />I'm the only one in my family who has become sensitive to gluten, so I tested the brownies out on them to see how good they really are...my family devoured them! They said that they taste like "normal" food lol. So I got the thumbs up and made more. I added peppermint extract to one batch and it tasted like thin mint cookies. Delicious. I will definitely buy these again because they are the best gluten free brownies I've had so far. They don't even have that funny after taste like a lot of gluten free foods. So I think Betty Crocker is on to something here. And I like it! I suggest that you buy these whether you are gluten free or not.<br /><br />{{{By the way, it states on the box that it's made in a gluten-free processing factory, so I'm not sure if the people complaining about stomach aches actually had a gluten reaction or a reaction to another ingredient. I was fine after eating the brownies, but it usually depends on how much I eat for gluten to affect my stomach. It always affects my skin, and I didn't break out after eating these...so I guess just know your body and eat the brownies accordingly.}}}

review/summary: Excellent GF brownie!
review/text: I've tried every GF brownie mix I've come across in the last 5 years, and this is the best.  They bake up with the same flakey, shiny top that regular brownies have.  I've made them for gluten-eating people and they can't tell the difference. So glad a mainstream company is now offering GF options.<br /><br />Some reviews say this isn't 100% GF, but my daughter eats these with no problem and she is very sensitive.  If her food is prepared with even a contaminated utensil, she will become sick within an hour.  Betty Crocker makes all their GF mixes in a dedicated GF facility.

review/text: These brownies are delicious! They blow the other store bought brands out of the water. You would think they would taste a little funky, but that's not the case with these. They not only taste great, but they're gluten free. Without any flakey tops or dry insides, everything's great. If it's brownies you're looking for, give Betty Crocker a shot. I think you'll be glad you did.

review/summary: Best GF brownie mix
review/text: I'm in a house with 3 celiacs that love some dessert.  We have tried every brownie we can find.  This mix is the BEST GF brownie we have had to date.  I have baked them when we had friends over and the enjoyed the brownies and would not have guessed they were GF.  You can add extra items such as nuts, chocolate chips, etc if you like extras.  The sugar content is quite high for these.  So if you watch sugar grams, you should be aware of this.  Serve this warm with some vanilla ice cream and you have a great GF dessert.<br /><br />Also, the price for the box of six that I bought was great.  In the grocery store, these can be $3.50 - $5.00 a box.

review/summary: Made my stomach hurt
review/text: My mom made this brownie mix for me during a visit.  The taste and texture are great and it's wonderful that they stuck to pretty natural ingredients.  However, I have my doubts as to how "GF" it really is, because it gave me my usual gluten stomachache.  I ate the brownies a couple of times over the next few days and each time I got that characteristic stomachache.  Hate to post a negative review because I'm so supportive of mainstream efforts to make GF foods available, but the truly gluten intolerant and celiac crowd should watch their reactions to this product carefully.

review/text: I was diagnosed with Celiac disease in April 2011, and this brownie mix has been the best thing that I ever stumbled upon.  The brownies are downright DELICIOUS.  They bake very nicely...and the flaky crust that forms on top is delectable. Most of my pans of brownies mysteriously lose four corner pieces moments after leaving the oven...I dont know why :)<br /><br />The cost is steep when compared to normal non-GF mixes, but if you think about it, gathering all of the necessary GF flours, xanthan gum, etc. to make your own, costs much much more than getting this mix...plus it wouldn't taste nearly as good.<br /><br />Thank you Betty Crocker for your GF efforts.  I will be a customer of yours for life so long as you keep making these delicious GF products.

review/summary: Surprisingly Yummy.
review/text: I just made these today, and I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised.  These will definitely go on my list of guilty pleasures.  The taste and consistency are such that you wouldn't be able to tell that these are gluten-free if you hadn't seen the box and made them yourself.<br /><br />Just a note for those who might try to veganize these.  I'm not vegan, but I have done some vegan baking, and I've also taken a food science class or two.  Trying to do your standard vegan substitutions for this mix probably won't work.  The non-glutinous flours and starches in this won't react the same as if there were regular all purpose flour in it.  That's one of the main reasons that this mix calls for the use of butter instead of oil, like a regular box brownie mix.  It's the saturated fat in the butter that's helping to hold these gluten-free flours and starches together.  Saturated fat is solid at room temperature.  Oil is not.  It's that saturated fat that's helping to give these brownies their structure.  Using Earth Balance margarine might help, because it does have saturated fat.  However, it doesn't have as much of it as butter.  You might need to get a bit creative by using half Earth Balance and half coconut butter.  Coconut butter has almost twice the saturated fat of butter, but Earth Balance is a bit more solid at higher temps.  The combination of the two might achieve the desired effect.  Also, using Ener-G egg won't provide enough emollients for this mix.  I would recommend using some flax goo (Google flax egg if not sure) in addition to the Ener-G egg.  The Ener-G egg will give the brownies some rise and the flax goo will add more moisture and additional cohesion to make sure that these things don't just crumble when you cut them.<br /><br />I haven't tried the above recommendations yet, so I can't give a 100% guarantee on the results, but it's a decent starting point to experiment.  The end result, done properly, is definitely worth the effort.

review/text: I first saw these GF brownies here on Amazon. I was skeptical and did not want to buy a whole case and end up not liking them. I found them in my local grocery store (almost $5 per box) and got a box. The first time I made them was for just my husband and I. He did NOT know they were gluten free and talked about how GREAT they were! Then I made them when we had people over......AFTER they ate them and complimented them I let them know they were gluten free.....ALL were shocked. These are moist and so good. Not gritty, grainy or the other weird textures you get in some other brands. There are little chocolate chips in the mix that when baked make little pockets of chocolate explosion. I am verrrrrry impressed with this and will keep buying! ---- I also mixed in nuts and that was GREAT! One time I decided to up the chocolate and added some Enjoy Life allergen free choco chips......that was super good! But not really needed as these are yummy enough on their own!

I have GF friends & customers, and I hate making two separate batches of desserts, but I also hate serving something that's only appealing to someone who never gets to eat wheat. This is a great solution.<br /><br />They make a normal sized pan and the price is right. Yay!

review/text: I spotted these in the grocery store (a lady had five boxes in her cart).  How perfect for a thank you gift for a neighbor who has gluten intolerance!  I made up the mix and was a little concerned to see how stiff the batter was, almost the consistency of thick mud pies.  The box warned that the dough would be heavy, so I restrained my desire to add more liquid.  Putting it in the baking pan required forcibly pushing it around with the spoon to reach the sides.<br />It came out of the oven looking like brownies, but I was still worried.  When I gave them to my neighbor, he was ecstatic to have gluten-free brownies.  His dessert options had been severely curtailed.<br />Later when he returned the baking dish, he raved about the brownies and how good they were.  He froze some of them for later (and didn't share even with his wife).<br />He's going to be searching the stores looking for more Betty Crocker gluten-free dessert mixes.

During our experimentation in the months leading up to Christmas, I found these on the shelf and gave them a try.  Wonderful!  They don't "rise" as high as regular brownies, and the batter seems particularly thick if you're not used to it, but they are equally tasty.  Everyone that had them had no idea they were gluten-free.  Added bonus: they're also dairy free, so lactose intolerant folks enjoyed them as well.

review/text: I'm glad a mainstream company (Betty Crocker) has some GF products available. That said, this mix is pretty dull. I am a professionally trained baker. Now that I'm GF, I'm lazy too, and don't keep a bunch of different flours around to create baking mixes, so I rely on prepared mixes a lot to make baked goods at home.<br /><br />I've made 2 boxes of this product.  It tends to be dry, hard, and not especially flavorful despite the chocolate chips in the mix. Brownies are one of those things that are easy to make GF with basic ingredients, so I'll keep doing that.

review/summary: Great.
review/text: This is a great gluten free product which can definitely pass for a gluten product.  Make it for your gluten eating friends and shock them when you tell them it's gluten free.<br /><br />I made it with dairy free earth balance "butter" and it was still great.  I did use eggs, but next time I'm going to try it with an egg replacer and see what happens.<br /><br />Best of all,  I got this at my regular grocery store.

review/summary: Another sick customer says NOT GLUTEN FREE
review/text: Oh, convenience.  You bring me back time and again to products that I should probably know better than to try. Like the other dozen or so one-star reviewers, I picked up this mix for some quick brownies and wound up with a full-blown gluten reaction - bloating, pain, nausea, the whole deal. I know this was the source of the problem because I haven't had anything new, different, or strange in a week or so. It couldn't have been the xantham gum because I had a very small portion - if the laxative effect is that strong in what would normally be considered a very, very small brownie (1.5" by 1.5",) then too much xantham gum is being used. The sad thing is, I used my brand new non-stick baking pan for this and now have to replace it (for the unaware, gluten can hang on in plastic, silicone, and non-stick coatings.) I'm just glad I had these after my anaphylacticly allergic child went to bed!

review/summary: Something wrong here
review/text: Have to add my voice to the minority, I tried these brownies and had the one of the quickest and most severe gluten reactions I have ever had.  This is especially disturbing because I am not even extremely gluten-sensitive and can tolerate small amounts.  All the ingredients listed on the package are things I normally consume without ill effects.  According to General Mills, some of their GF products are manufactured on the same equipment as their regular wheat products, they just clean them in between.  Maybe some GF lots are getting through with contamination?  I don't know, but there is definitely something wrong here.<br /><br />On the up side, they tasted great!

review/summary: Amazed!
review/text: These are really, really good!<br />The pros:<br />-They taste just like the Betty Crocker box-mix-brownies you remember from your gluten days, the ones your kids might remember, too.  And they're a snap to mix up and bake.<br />-You don't have to add chocolate chips, nuts, cream cheese, or frosting on top to make them taste good. But you can if you want to!<br />-They're readily available at your local store, or here for a better price!  Mainstream and GF, yay!<br />-They have that dense, chewy, fudgy texture most of us love in a brownie.  These aren't cakey or crumbly.<br /><br />The cons:<br />-The mix only makes an 8x8 inch pan.  Bob's Red Mill GF brownie mix makes a 9x13 inch pan for roughly the same price, which might be better if you have a large family or are taking them to a party.<br />-These don't make a good brownie sundae with ice cream (they'll get hard) and they aren't good for crumbling up to layer in a trifle or parfait (they'll get hard and icky).  I'd recommend the Bob's Red Mill GF brownie mix again for that, or just a scratch recipe.<br /><br />A great find for someone who's got a celiac kid at home with a sweet tooth or maybe a just a celiac "kid at heart!"

review/text: LOVE this mix. I use it for basic brownies (make sure to dust the pan with cocoa powder before baking for a better result), and for other recipes on the Betty Crocker website. I am celiac, but my husband isn't, and he begs me to make these all the time!<br /><br /> I also love the bulk packaging because I end up saving about $1-2 per box as opposed to buying them individually at the grocery store.

review/text: It was recently determined that I have a gluten intolerance, so I've been missing all of my favorite baked goods. I wasn't expecting much from this mix, but I splurged and bought a box. These taste just like 'normal' brownies. I did replace the melted butter with applesauce because my partner is allergic to butter and oils. We couldn't even taste the applesauce because of how chocolately these are. (:

review/summary: Betty's Best GF Brownie Mix (w/dairy free recipe)
review/text: Yum.  I have been GF for over 5 years and this is the very best GF mix that I have tried so far, tastes like scratch! A couple notes on how I made them vs the box instructions.  I added the following: 1 tsp apple cider vinegar, 1 Tbs (decaf)instant coffee 'grounds', 2 eggs, 2 Tbs vegan(Earth Balance)butter substitute, 3 Tbs coconut oil (melted).  IF you prefer a fudgy, gooey-in-the-middle brownie...then the key is to UNDER bake! And yes, the edges will still be crispy.  I baked mine in a lightly oiled, parchment-lined 9x9 pan for 16-18 minutes (rotate pan at the 8 minute mark)  After they have cooled, I cut and wrap each brownie in wax paper, slip them into a gallon zip bag and freeze.  GF baked goodies keep very well in the freezer, when tightly wrapped.  They thaw in minutes.  Subscribe-and-Save is the only way to go!

review/summary: Betty Crocker GF Brownies -- delicious!
review/text: Betty Crocker met my high expectations with their chocolate brownie mix. The ingredients are minimal, just butter and eggs and the baking directions couldn't be more simple. I love that this brownie mix has chocolate chips mixed in, I think it helps make the final product more moist when you have melted chocolate throughout each bite. The ONLY reason I gave these four stars instead of five is because they are so high in calories because of all the butter and eggs. I know this is part of why they taste so good but its also hard to justify making them very often because I feel guilty eating so much saturated fat!

I cannot wait to test her other gluten free products.  But first I have to get over eating to much of this one.

These brownies are NOT one of the products we tossed.  We ate them up, they are delicious!  My son was so happy when he took a bite of these delicious brownies.  Even my hubby - a dessert aficionado who would probably curl up and die if he had to give up gluten - loved them and had to be chased away from the pan!

review/text: I just found these brownies the other day in the store. I haven't had much luck with many gluten free baking products so far but these are really REALLY good. They taste just like regular brownies and weren't like hockey pucks when I took them out of the oven.<br /><br />For those of you who believe that they may not be gluten free because you had stomach upset and bloating, READ THE LABEL. This product, like many gluten free baking products contains xanthan gum which is considered a highly effective laxative. It can cause stomach pains, bloating, and diarrhea when ANYONE consumes it. So moderation is really important. Also the xanthan gum can contain traces wheat so if you have a wheat allergy which is NOT the same as celiac disease you may have a reaction to this product...<br /><br />Eating them in moderation has left me(and my family) with no ill effects. They taste great and I look forward to trying the other Betty Crocker gluten free products!

review/text: I've tried quite a few different brands of gluten-free brownie mixes, and this has got to be my favorite!  I find that some GF foods tend to be a bit more dry (compared to wheat-based), but this brownie mix makes a great, very moist and fudgy brownie.  Instead of the oil, I often use a small cup of applesauce (I like the stuff without added sugar) and 1/2 cup of Eggbeaters.  The taste is still great and it's a bit lower in fat.

review/summary: Awesome brownies - non-GF will enjoy!
review/text: These brownies are AWESOME!  I found out I have a wheat allergy about a month ago.  My first GF brownie mix I tried was Pamela's.  They were "gritty" and just not like the brownies I was used to.  I only ate one and threw the rest of the pan out.  I saw the good reviews of the Betty Crocker brownies on Amazon, so I took a risk on a pack of 6.  I am THRILLED to report these brownies are easy to make (add 1/2 stick butter and 2 eggs) -- and most importantly they are delicious!  I can definitely bring these to family gatherings and other events without others suspecting a thing!!  I'm so thrilled.  And the price is a lot better than the other gluten-free brownie mixes out there.

review/summary: Balance - the misnomer
review/text: You have adopted the word "balance" on your product.  This word is generally used for a true balance of decaf and regular coffee.  This misleads people purposely to think that they are using a coffee that is a mix of both. I have always mixed the two and was happy to see that you have a "balance" and believed that it truly was such.  That was quite a disappointment.

review/summary: Tahini at a Bargain
review/text: I didn't know from different brands so I got this because it was a bargain on Amazon.  When it arrived I opened the first jar and was surprised because it was mainly a viscuous liquid, and I wondered if I had gotten a defective product or if the bargain was because it was inferior...boy, was I naive!<br /><br />I had always gotten my tahini from the grocer, paid double this price, and it was mostly a solid brick of stuff I had to deal with.  I like this so much better...it still has the flavor and it's actually able to be measured and used in recipes so I find many more opportunities to use tahini now that I have it.  It will take me a while to use all four jars (only into my second one now after a few months) but I do intend to buy it here again...

review/summary: Not all that hot
review/text: It takes alot of this to TASTE it in tea or in food.  If you put it right on TOP of the food and don't mix it in then you can taste more of it.  Also, look up Agave Plant online.  You will find it high in oxalate acid and well, "the juice" of this plant on my hands did leave me with contact dermatitis.  The other problem was the oxalate level.  I happen to have to watch mine, and this is too high because the amount you have to use is well, alot to really get a sweet taste/as sweet as sugar.  Right, it doesn't raise blood sugar - but considering there is no real nutritional benefit this is one dietary "extra" I'm passing up.  I'm not diabetic so I can't speak for that situation, but I suppose if you were diabetic without a weightproblem (this is not low calorie) and no oxalate issues (kidney stone), then you might consider this product.  If not diabetic, don't bother.  Too pricey when a teasp of sugar is only 16 calories and sweetens much more easily.

review/text: I tried a a good number of incense by HEM and I really enjoy the Precious Rose scent. I am 98% sure that the oil that the sticks were soaked in was synthetic; because I smelled organic rose essence and oil 2 different rose synthetic oils and this scent smells very similar to the synthetics. I also think that the scent is synthetic because natural/organic rose oil is very expensive and I do not see how it could be used for such inexpensive product as the incense sticks. Nevertheless, the scent is very pleasant. At first I wanted to give this product 4 stars because of my suspicion of the synthetic oil and no identifier of it on the packaging, but the I decided to give it 5 stars because I honestly enjoy it a lot. If I could I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars.

review/summary: subtle, natural rose scent.  lovely
review/text: This is the incense for those who wrinkle their nose and blink when they encounter a strong fragrance.<br /><br />"Scented" is a word that usually makes me cringe.  I am very sensitive to manufactured fragrances.  Things meant to fragrance a room, like "Yankee Candles" make me feel nauseous.  The smell is like an overabundance of fake concentrated scent attempting to mask a strong chemical fume.  I do not understand how anyone can stand to be in the same room.<br /><br />The majority of popular scented items have this strong chemical smell to me.<br /><br />I don't mind the scent of certain varieties of incense, but they are often too strong and overpowering to use in a room without the window open.<br /><br />I've tried a tonne of different incense, from numerous manufacturers.  I've even tried at least 5 or 6 different "rose" incense over the years.<br /><br />HEM "Precious Rose" incense is perfect.  It is a light, natural rose scent. Lovely and subtle. It does not overpower the room, it is truly like sitting outside near a few rose bushes in bloom.  I now buy it in bulk at a great price from XTREMEK, here on Amazon.<br /><br />The HEM lavender is lovely as well, and the scent is very similar to being near wild English Lavender, but of course lavender has a stronger scent than roses, so I do not use it nearly as often.<br /><br />note:<br />HEM also make a "sandal rose" and a "musk rose". I don't care for either of those.

review/text: We purchased a Prime membership so we could get cat litter delivered. I had been hoping that I could also get seltzer delivered, as we go through about a bottle day. Yes, we should get that seltzer making kit and be done with it, but we're pretty sure someone has purchased that as a gift for our upcoming wedding.<br /><br />Sadly, there is no actual seltzer available that is Prime eligible (do you hear me, Amazon? You'll make a bundle off of us if you add some seltzer to the Prime ranks) so I tried out this 12-pack of club soda. It was kinda gross. It took us almost 3 weeks to go through it all. I know club soda usually has some sodium added--that's why it is different from seltzer, which is just carbonated water, potentially with added citric acid. This White Rock club soda, however, is way saltier than most of the ones I've tried before. It was almost like drinking brackish water. I will not be ordering this again.

review/summary: I love these pods!
review/text: I love a good latte, but it has to be right - strong and rich (two or three shots per 12 ounce glass.)  I can't stand bitter coffee, and can't even drink most coffee from drip makers.  I have an espresso maker and I use the Lavazza decaf pods when I don't want as much caffeine as a regular cup, sometimes mixing one or two decaf with regular so I get the flavor without as much kick, or all decaf if it's in the afternoon.  If you "subscribe and save" it's very reasonably priced.<br /><br />The pods make it easy to make multiple shots back-to-back, because there's no cleaning needed, you just knock out the pod and put another one right in.<br /><br />Some things I've noticed:<br /><br />1) You get better results if you carefully center the pod, and use a tamper as you would loose coffee (even though they're not supposed to need it.)<br /><br />2) The Decaf espresso loses color earlier in the extraction process than the regular.  Since I use the "watch carefully until it turns blonde" method of knowing when a shot is done, I've had to go a little longer with decaf.<br /><br />3) This is about all pods:  If the espresso is watery or clear from the first drip, pull the cup away and stop.  The pod is not centered and you're passing water around it.

review/summary: LOTS of Wintergreen
review/text: Although billed as "Festive blend of organic green tea and lively spearmint and peppermint", I'm reviewing this product mainly to let people know that the wintergreen taste is dominant in this tea.  I really dislike wintergreen, but hoped as the last ingredient on the label, that the wintergreen component of the flavor wouldn't be noticeable.  However, wintergreen oil is powerful stuff, and it really overwhelms the green tea and peppermint/spearmint components.  Honestly, I think I'd prefer a more straightforward mix of green tea and peppermint and/or spearmint leaves, without additional ingredients like lemongrass, ginger, and especially wintergreen.

review/summary: It needs a new shape
review/text: It's an ok product.  I got it for my kitten to teeth on.  Because it's a stick, he had a hard time getting his mouth around it to pick it up when it's on a flat surface like the kitchen floor so he would just swat it around until he lost it under the refridgerator.  So I decided to put it in the microwave for eight seconds until it became soft and then held it in a spiral shape until it cooled off and became hard again.  This gave it some dimension and was then easier for my kitten to get a hold of and chew on.  He loved it after that.  It helped him greatly with his teeth growing in.

review/summary: Primary Ingredient is Soy
review/text: I've seen these at my local Petco where I looked over the ingredient list.  Soy or Soy protein is either the first or second ingredient.  Soy is something I avoid in anything I give my cat.  Soy isn't very digestible by cats and is often a common food allergen.  Also soy is also considered bad for your cat's thyroid gland.  In addition soy may also impact the amount of Taurine your cat absorbs; a lack of Taurine can cause blindness in cats.

review/summary: My Cat Loves Them!
review/text: AT first my cat was not really sure what to do with them other than play with them but he figured out really quickly that they where treats. Also having these around has kept him from chewing on everything so much. This was a really awesome buy and I plan on keeping these on hand at all times.

review/summary: cat chews
review/text: My kitten( 11 months) who likes to chew on everything loves these treats.  They are sort of like kitty raw hides. She knows where I keep them and goes to look for them. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I wish they lasted longer, she can chew and eat one in just a couple of minutes.

review/summary: Major choking hazard
review/text: Warning - do not buy these for your cat. They are a major choking hazard. I narrowly averted disaster when my cat chewed off an eraser sized piece about 30 seconds into gnawing on this stick. The piece was hard and not easily chewed or ground up. In other words, it's not like food, but more like the consistency of a hard piece of wax. He would have choked on it if I hadn't quickly taken it out of his mouth. I threw the rest of the package away.<br /><br />I thought these were chew toys and they dissolved like rawhide (or not at all). I did not expect them to break off into pieces that could be choked on. I am horrified that these are being marketed and sold for pets. Amazon shame on you for carrying this product.
