review/summary: Cheesy Chicken delight
review/text: Our westies love the Caesar Canine Cuisine foods, they seem to prefer the pates to the sauced varieties, but they eat all of them. I like to give them a big variety of flavors and Caesar's food comes in so many wonderful flavors. This is one of their favorites.  And it is a better deal than in the stores.  So that is super for me.

review/text: Convenience size container. Food is always fresh. I have one 10 lbs baby that should weigh 8 pounds so Vet suggested cutting her food back and adding canned green beans. The gravy is just the right amountto flavor the green beans and she loves it. So much, I have had to do this for my not over wgt dog, too. Great Product and delivery.

review/summary: Excellent product, exactly as advertised.
review/text: I have a basenji dog that is a bit "picky" and will not eat some dog foods (I have tried several of the "premium" and "super-premium" dog foods.<br /><br />He loves several of the Cesar Canine Cuisine foods and this is one of his favorites.  There is never any hesitation when I put his food down, he digs right in and consumes it almost instantly.<br /><br />There have been no GI upsets with this food - his stools are completely normal.  Traveling with him is easy with this food because it doesn't require refrigeration and no mixing - although I do give him dry food to "snack on" at will, he usually eats only a small amount of this and only when he has been very active.<br /><br />He gets two packages a day, one in the morning, one in the evening so a pack of 24 lasts 12 days.

review/summary: Deliciously Tart & Tangy - Heaven on Toast!
review/text: Robertson's are famous for their (orange) Golden Shred marmalade but I've always been more of a fan of the lesser-known lemon version, Silver Shred as I prefer the tart, tangy flavor of lemons to the gentler sweetness you get with oranges. This stuff is amazing on toast made with really good bread, and even better in my opinion if the toast has been allowed to cool and then slathered in a really good butter like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00289S3X2">Beurre d'Isigny</a> or even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CC1FM8">Kerrygold</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010EGNGK">President</a> before spooning on the marmalade. As its name suggests, Silver Shred contains a fair amount of real shredded lemon peel which I know some aren't so fond of, but if you're among the "not fond" crowd, it's easy enough to avoid those bits or pick them out and just stick to the mouthwatering lemony jelly. Heavenly stuff!

review/summary: Cute Halloween Novely Beverage!
review/text: Obviously this is a just a Halloween gimmick, or novelty beverage, and not something most people are going to stock up on to serve all the time.  The beverage powder, when mixed with hot water,  creates an orange-flavored  hot beverage.  It's supposed to taste like hot chocolate, but tastes more like a mild coconut flavored beverage to me.  It's a pleasant taste, actually.<br /><br />This Amazon deal offers three metal canisters with Peanuts characters on it.  The canisters aren't all that large, and each canister makes about 6 cups of "hot chocolate," again, not such a bargain.<br /><br />A cute Halloween novelty; worth purchasing at a discount price.  At full price I'd probably pass.

review/text: Taste is OK for kids, but this should be called "Halloween Artificially Colored and Flavored Sweet Drink." No surprise on the Yellow #6, of course...but really, can you call it "Hot Chocolate" without even a hint of cocoa in the mix? Not in my book. Rename it and maybe it'll go up to a three-star concoction. Maybe.

review/summary: Okay but WAY too pricey on here!
review/text: I bought these a few days ago to try out for $5 for (1) 11 oz bag at Costco. They are edible but not great. The slices are too thick IMO making some really hard, I have found ends and many slices with the core still in it. These are pretty bitter as well. I think I would enjoy the red ones a lot more but am not sure if Costco carries those. Still well worth $5 though considering a reg. bag of organic chips aren't much less... the price on here is pretty nuts though! :(

review/summary: Healthy, tasty, but slightly expensive
review/text: I found these in a Whole Foods one day and thought they were fantastic, but they were also quite expensive.  Amazon offers them in bulk packages for a bit less which is nice, though they're still on the costly side.  The great thing about these is that they are baked, not fried.  That means that there is no fat and very few calories, but they are still satisfyingly crunchy, making them a fantastic "got the munchies" snack.  These are indeed cut from real apples and every once in a while you'll get a stem or some slices that are just peel, but for the most part the quality is quite good.  My wife didn't seem to like them, though I'm not sure why - I think they're yummy.  :)  I'd certainly recommend them to anyone who can afford a somewhat pricey, but extremely healthy, snack.  However I'd also suggest trying to find a small bag to try first at a local grocery (most likely an organic-focused one - I don't think Food Lion carries these) to make sure you like them before buying this much.

review/summary: Delicious Tart and Crispy Chips, A Wholesome Snack
review/text: *****<br />These apple chips are tart, very crispy, and yummy! They don't have the processed or chemically taste that some dried apples have. They also are not soggy at all--I like my apple chips very crispy! They are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, gluten free, and made from Washington State apples with five apples in every bag. These are a truly healthy and delicious snack.<br /><br />These particular chips are only just barely sweet, mostly tart. If you want sweet apple chips, you can buy Fuji apple chips from the same company that are just as crisp and good. I like to mix both together for a sweet-tart combo.<br /><br />I would also recommend buying these chips in smaller bags (the 2.6 ounce size) unless quite a few people are going to be eating these rather quickly. The reason is that exposure to moisture can render these crispy chips too soft. I like buying them in the smaller bags and then repackaging them in a resealable plastic bag to get rid of all of the extra air. Then I take out only what I plan to eat and quickly reseal the bag. My chips are always crispy this way.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: At first I doubted that these were going to be JUST APPLES. But they are! no sugars added which is great, because apple chips are amazing on their own! Forgo the hassle of making them on your own every once and a while and order a few from Bare Fruit. I don't think you will be disappointed. The granny smith apples are true to the fresh apple flavor. Great snack alone or maybe dipped in a little homemade peanut butter spread.<br />ENJOY!

review/text: These apples are delicious and work great for the HCG diet as a substitute for regular apples.  This is important when you travel as much as I do because the Dept. of Agriculture allows you to take these back into the country, whereas regular apples are subject to a fine.  The (Bare) apples also provide the crunch that is so satisfying when you are craving a snack.  I wish MY Costco would carry them.

review/text: First of all - conventional apples are one of the 'dirty dozen' of produce to avoid, so finding an organic version of dried apples to snack on is wonderful. I first got these at Costco like others here, but I am going to order here now.<br /><br />They are nice alone - but try them with a bit of organic raw cheese, some pistachios or healthy crackers - delicious! The combination of the tangy with the salty /creamy is mouth watering and satisfying.<br /><br />Much preferable if you are having a sweet tooth to do this as opposed to candy or pastry. You do have to watch the quantities because the sugar grams will add up, even though it is natural fruit sugar.<br /><br />I really encourage parents to get these for their kids as a snack, and try them with cheese or something salty.

review/text: The Lemon Lotus is a wonderful product. Absolutely delicious, it's like drinking a glass of sweet lemonade with an ever so slight hint of the x50 Blue Lotus extract flavor (which I also love).<br /><br />I like how they switched from the shots to the powder. It dissolves easily when steeped and stirred into hot water (or when funneled into a water bottle and shook). I prefer this for 2 reasons.<br />One, the shots where just that, shots. As a powder I can enjoy a whole glass of it!<br />Two, I can more easily control the dose -- stronger when I'm in a bad mood, or weaker if I just want a nice refreshing drink.<br /><br />As for its effects, I would say overall, it subtly puts me into a calmer, more talkative and generally happier mood.<br /><br />Overall, I really love this product and will definitely buy more as needed. Was shipped and arrived very quickly and Mood & Mind have always been more than happy to answer any questions I have about their products.<br />Highly recommended, 5/5!!!

review/summary: Lemon Lotusade? Lemonotusade? Whatever you call it, it's great!
review/text: In the time since I first discovered blue lotus, I've tried several conventional and a few unconventional methods to to consume it. The first time I got the powder, I just sort of grabbed a handful and dumped it into my mouth. That did not go well.<br /><br />Next I tried dumping a few tablespoons into yogurt and then eating it. That also did not go well.<br /><br />I tried buying the plant itself and burning it, steeping it in hot water, and even tossing it into a salad, but overall, my favorite method was making a tea out of the powder.<br /><br />Or so I thought. I decided to try the mood drink despite my apprehensions, and boy am I glad I did! When I got it, I opted to have two servings at once, since I'm what you might call a tall drink of water (or lemon lotus drink, as the case may be), and after making the drink and seeing how easily it dissolved , I resisted my urge to pinch my nose and down it in one.<br /><br />It tasted GOOD! And I don't mean the sort of "good" where you grimace and rasp "H-hey, this is *cough* kind of good!", I mean good like a nice glass of lemonade, with a hint of blue lotus. There was no annoying grit (the biggest problem I have when I make tea, but that's my fault) and it had a nice effect that wasn't too overbearing. Yet another highly enjoyable experience from a company that actually cares about the quality of their merchandise.<br /><br />BONUS RECIPE: Lemon Lotus Piledriver<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />1-4 servings of Lemon Lotus Mood Drink<br />1 bottle of Perrier or something similar<br />1-4 tablespoons of lemon juice<br />Vodka (Citrus works well, but plain is fine too)<br />2 pinches of lemon salt<br />Ice<br /><br />Directions:<br />Mix lemon lotus powder with room temp vodka, mix until drink powder is thoroughly dissolved.<br />Add in Perrier and lemon juice, put into shaker with ice and shake vigorously.<br />Pour into highball glass, garnish with lemon wedges or lotus ice cubes and serve.<br /><br />PS: Check out my blog for more recipes and such!

review/text: I have tried this product many times as it really, really helps relax and it helps with sleep. An FYI, it mixes really well with your favorite liqueur. I feel it mixes well with either Whiskey, like a whiskey sour, or with vodka. You need to try this! And beyond that, this Company has the best customer service I have encountered with any mail order Company. They really, really care!

review/summary: Disappointment
review/text: I'm not sure if the four I purchased were from a bad batch or what, but the product had no effect on me whatsoever. I have tried the blue lotus 50:1 tablets and was very satisfied. I thought a liquid blue lotus would be absorbed better by the body, thus a better effect. It was quite the opposite. You live and you learn I guess, but I wouldnt try this product again unless it was free.

review/summary: Its Worth a Try
review/text: 50:1 lemon lotus 4 pack shots (first time user) Item was mind altering but not as powerfull as expected, started with one shot early in the day and recieved mild effects felt sort of like an alcohol buzz, later in the day i had another shot and had the same effects as b4 drank a can of beer and another shot trying to get more out of the lotus within the hour i did not feel much of a change,had a 3rd shot and no change 45 minutes later i was sober. problem could be because i didnt use right, was left wondering if maby you can only get so much effect out of product similar to kratom (you can only get so high with kratom after that you get sick and misureable) then thought maby i was suposed to take all 4 shots at once for the great feeling and phychoactive or hipnotic effect who knows it was fun anyway. After i do more research on using lotus i will most likely buy this product again and give it another run.<br />  Please do not let my story discourage you from buying and trying this product. my intent was to get the message across if you dont know how to use this product learn about it first then try it out, that way the seller doesnt get blamed for your poor results

review/text: This product is a complete waste of time and money.  Me and a friend tried it with a bottle of wine and it had absolutely no noticeable effects whatsoever on either one of us.  We did feel a little more sleepy than normal after taking it.  But other than that, this product did absolutely nothing to either one of us.  After my experience with this product, I am convinced the other reviews are either shill reviews or from inexperienced users who merely received a placebo effect from this product.

review/summary: Convenient, healthy
review/text: My 8 month old son loves these. I keep one in my purse at all times. He is breastfeed and we make his other solid foods (cook, puree and freeze)--but this is what I use when we're out so that I don't have to worry about microwaving or his fresh food going bad from being out too long. He really likes this flavor and I'm happy because it includes three foods that I haven't been making for him. I'm trying to introduce him to all the fruits and vegetables that are OK for him to eat at this age, and I'm hoping that eating the spinach in this will make him less likely to reject it later... Only downside that I can think of is that these are rather watery. Not sure if that is solved if you move to the Stage 3 ones.

review/text: If you want/need convenience, this item is fabulous!  We always rate the organic baby food pouches high and our only concern is the price.  We find the pouches great for taking to restaurants, in the car, on picnics, to the zoo, etc.  Also, it continues to be an easy way to get super foods into our toddlers without the preparation of the fruits and vegetables!  We still keep them on hand even after the baby food days are gone.

review/text: My 9 month old started eating this flavor at about 7 months old and loves it!  She isn't really a picky eater, but she likes some things more than others.  When its time for the spinach/mango/pear she takes one tastes then asks for more!  I've tasted it, its pretty good.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the consistency is a bit watery and difficult to keep on the spoon when feeding the baby.  I'd love it if they just didn't puree it quite as much or didn't add quite so much water, then it would be perfect.

review/text: This flavor is great, I love the fact it has veggies and fruit together. I gave this flavor to my 6 month old baby and he loved it. If you have problem with this blend being to runny I solved it by using Boon spoon or Plum organics boon spoons for pouches which made it breeze to feed the baby.<br />My son loves all the other flavors he tried as well ( pear; pear & peas & broccoli; apples & cherry; banana & blueberries & beats ), he did not like sweet potato & apricot flavor, it was too tart and sour for him, but I contacted Happy Baby customer service and the next batch should have more sweet potato to help with the sour taste, but if you can buy just one pack and try it you might have a baby that likes it either way.<br />Most of all I love the packaging, it is perfect since we travel a lot and it is so much lighter then glass jars and easier to pack as well.

review/text: We tried this flavor when my son was almost 6 months and he wouldn't eat it. It is too sour even for me. I have talked to customer service and they had complains from other people and the next batch will have more sweet potato in so it should taste better. I will give it try again when the new batch is out. Otherwise my son loved all the other flavors we tried so far ( pear, mango&spinach&pear, Pear&peas&broccoli, apple&cherry, banana&beat&blueberries ). So try one before ordering bunch on Amazon.<br />The pouch idea is great, so easy to travel with! Some of the flavors are little runny but I am using Boon spoon and it works great. I am also going to try out the Plum organic Boon spoon for pouches, should fit Happy baby pouches as well.

She does prefer the Peas, Broccoli, & Pear flavor, but this is also a favorite.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the smell of the mango can be pretty overpowering.

I am a little surprised, since sweet potatoes are her favorite.  Maybe if your kids like apricot they will like this flavor, but mine didn't.  We'll be sticking with the Pears, Peas, & Broccoli flavor.

This fruit and veggie mix is perfect -- she gets some green veggies, but it really does taste just like pears!  I've tried several flavors, and this is her favorite by far.  My baby is starting solids now and she likes this one too.

review/text: My 5.5 yr old son LOVES apricots and sweet potatoes so I was excited to try this flavor. I tried a sample package sold at Target and it tasted pretty good so I ordered a bunch online. He took one taste of this batch and handed it right back to me. I tasted it and whoa- it is SUUUUUPER SOUR - much more so than the one I tried at the store!?!? It gave me goosebumps! Wha???? I now wonder if they changed the recipe, started using unripe apricots or I mistakenly bought the wrong brand of this combo??? I'll have to try mixing it with some applesauce in a GU bottle or try to add it to my baked sweet potatoe/apple dish so it's not a total waste of money. Beware of this flavor!

Terribly bitter (just the thought makes my mouth water) and runny.  No wonder he wouldn't eat it.  I wouldn't either!  I did buy some of the other varieties offered by HappyBaby and he loves them.  I think this is just a bad taste combo.  Yuck!

review/summary: Very sour but baby loves it
review/text: This is probably my toddler's favorite pouch.  I have to admit, there's a lot of lemon juice in this mix, which makes the pouch somewhat sour.  My toddler loves lemons though so this is just exactly his taste.  If you're unsure whether your baby likes sour, don't buy this in bulk - it's probably for an acquired taste! :)

review/text: My children love the happy baby organics. I just wish they had more of a selection on Amazon. I have tried the food, as I try everything before giving it to my kids, and they taste great. I highly recommend it to any mom that wants their children to eat organic. It is easy to use, easy to travel with, and healthy for them!

review/summary: Great for on-the-go snacks
review/text: My one year old can actually "drink" these right from the package, using the spout like a straw, which makes these a super convenient option to have for snacks when we're out and about--no bib or spoon needed. He has food allergies, so finding processed foods that meet his needs and are still healthy and conveninent can be tough. He has loved all of the Happy Baby products we've tried. The multi-packs are a great deal and it is nice to be able to stock up this way instead of just buying singles from the only store around here that carries them.

review/summary: Healthy and convenient
review/text: I found these at Target a few months back and decided to give them a try for my dairy/soy allergic one year old son. It is tough finding on-the-go food options for him that meet with his dietary needs and satisfy my pickiness for healthy kids food. The deals for the multi-packs are great. My little one is old enough now that with a bit of help, he can just suck the food straight from the "spout" of the package like a straw and he LOVES them. He gets so excited when he sees me pull one out and they are so easy to throw in a purse or diaper bag so that I always have a good snack for him with me, no bib or utensils needed.

review/summary: Tasty & Nutritious in one easy to administer pouch!
review/text: My 15 month-old twin boys aren't big fans of spinach, but they LOVE these pouches. This is a great combination with the mangos and pears and you can still taste the spinach. Anytime my boys need a quick snack, I whip out one of these pouches and can be assured they are getting their fiber, vitamins, and nutrients.  Also try the Beets, Blueberries, and Banana combo!!!<br /><br />These pouches are especially helpful during teething time or when your babies get to the 'picky eater' stage. For the teethers, it's been helpful for us to place a few pouches in the fridge. For the picky eaters, we administer a swig of this inbetween bites and we can cram in a few more bites. These pouches are much better than giving pure juice and aren't messy. If you do give them the pouches to eat on their own, just be wary that they may squeeze too hard and up comes all of the food. The screw on top helps if they don't finish it all. Just place it into the fridge for the next day or later and if you're out, pace it back into your diaper bag with a cold pack. No yucky jar top taste, no spoons to mess around with, and the combinations are tasty.  Just make sure your little one doesn't place the tops in their mouths.  Mine have done that a couple of times but with all the advantages of these pouches, I can keep an eye on the top a bit more.<br /><br />With the subscribe and save through Amazon, it's so much more cost saving than purchasing these in the stores.

review/text: All of the Happy Baby Stage 2 Foods I have ordered have had an excellent flavor, but the puree is a very watery consistency that requires me to mix in cereal just so it holds onto the spoon long enough to make it to my daughters mouth. If your baby is past basic introductions where you water it down to a soupy consistency I would try another brand or the next stage or two up. Very disappointed because the flavor is great.

review/text: I started using HAPPYBABY foods when my son was about nine months old.  At that time I was only aware of their frozen line.  I was SO EXCITED to hear about their pouches.  Although my son is now eating solids, I purchased some of the Stage 2 and 3 to use as snacks/fillers for other meals.  I loved the food combinations in the pouches.  An added plus, all the pouch packaging is BPA and pthlate free.<br /><br />My son loves the pouches.  I put the Stage 3 meat combos over pasta with a little cheese sprinkled on top for a nutritious, great tasting meal for my son (or the whole family).  He thinks he's getting a special treat.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend HAPPYBABY products.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Pouches Not Recyclable
review/text: This product tries to skirt the fact that the pouches are NOT recyclable, and the caps are a choking hazard. It doesn't make a lot of sense....buy an organic food product that puts more trash in the landfill. They toss around the buzz phrase "BPA free", but it is still more plastic going into the landfill. And, they use another buzz phrase, "lower carbon footprint than glass jars". Huh? Glass may have a higher carbon footprint, but it can be (and is) recycled over & over into food containers. Plastic cannot be recycled into new food containers. Yes the caps are recyclable, but recycled plastic often has no market for reuse. And, make sure your child doesn't try to eat them first.

review/text: My 2 year old daughter loves these sort of squeeze pouches so I ordered a whole case of these thinking that I could sneak some veggies in. Unfortunately this is not the case. These are so sour that she shudders after taking a sip!  So just says "don't like it!" and wants the plain mango one. Curious, I tried it and although it has a very sweet taste in the beginning the after taste of sour beets is awful!  Be prepared, if your little ones aren't a fan of beets, they may not be a fan of this flavor!

review/text: I was hoping to "sneak" beets into my sons snack, but there is no hiding with this brand. In fact, the beet flavor is rather overwhelming, and rather on the "raw" side. I enjoy beets, pickled and roasted, but this flavor is just not appealing at all. If your kid loves beets (maybe even raw ones?) go for it.  Also, someone commented on it being a runny consistency but my recently ordered batch is on the thick side.

This was his first mix of foods after he's had his first foods an ingredient at a time...You should see how he opens his mouth big like he's about to swallow me whole every single time I bring one of these to him and am about to open it. It is so convenient, too...because when we are out at the park or after a doctor's appointment and he's hungry, I can just take one of these out of the diaper bag and squeeze it into the spoon for him to eat it. Also, when he only has half of it, we put the rest in the fridge and then in the evening we heat it up in a bowl of hot water. It's also great that we never actually touch the food w/ the spoon, so no bacteria goes into the pouch...We love it...We really have no negatives about it...I'm about to order a new batch now as we're vising some friends in TX next week and we need to grab food for the plane and also for the trip. These are great because they're not as heavy as the jars.

review/summary: Sweet and a little tart, but delicious and fresh!
review/text: We were a bit apprehensive about purchasing this banana, beet and blueberry flavor after reading several reviews that it was sour and their children did not like the taste.  However, our 8-month old daughter loved this flavor and in fact, hasn't opened her mouth as widely for any of the other Happy Baby flavors as she did with this one.  The consistency looks like a berry smoothie and it smelled great.  So I tasted it and it does have a bit of a tart taste, but it's very slight to me.  I almost wanted to finish it because it had just enough sweetness to go with the slightly tart taste.  It's too bad this isn't made in the 4.2oz package because our daughter usually wants just a bit more than what comes in this package.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive than some other organic brands, but well worth the price.  In our opinion, the flavors taste so much more natural and fresh and taste great to us as adults rather than having that "baby food" type of taste that many brands have.<br /><br />Also, there is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L4BV5U">Plum Organics Dispensing Boon Spoon, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> that can screw onto this packaging as well as the Plum Organics packages of food.  It comes with a carrying case for the spoon tips.  This makes feeding time so much easier when you screw the spoon onto the package and then can easily throw away the package and put the spoon tip back in the case rather than having to bring a separate spoon and container to squeeze the food into so you can feed your baby.

Now I am stuck with a box of these, not knowing what to do with it. I'd like to give them away, but if my son doesn't like them, how can I know if other babies will eat it? I will not buy them again. My mistake was that I didn't read all the reviews on this item :(. A hard lesson learned!

review/summary: Our Favorite Happy Baby Flavor
review/text: We have tried almost all of the Happy Baby flavors and I can honestly say that this one is my daughter's favorite flavor of this brand. I only wish that the package was slightly larger as she is able to finish it in a few moments and sometimes wants a second!

review/text: My one-year-old loves these!  I like the mixture of fruit and veggie, and they are so convenient.  I haven't tasted them, but my daughter eats them so fast and gets excited just when she sees it.  So I'm assuming they are delicious!

review/summary: Too sweet!
review/text: We generally make food for our little one at home, but I wanted to try a couple pouches because they seem like a good option for throwing into the diaper bag.  I chose the Happy Baby Broccoli, Peas and Pear because of the great reviews from other parents.  It's true, our baby opens his mouth WIDE for this stuff.  He is a fairly good eater of whatever we give him, but I don't think I've seen him this excited to eat since he first started on solids.  The problem is, I tasted a tiny bit of it and it was extremely sweet.  The package doesn't list any additional sugars or sweeteners, but I find it hard to believe that pears can be THAT sweet.  Even if the sugar comes 100% from the pears and is natural, I still think it's too much.  I'll be mixing it in with oatmeal until it's done and after that I will try a couple other brands to see if there is anything less sweet out there.  If not...I'll just have to suck it up and bring homemade food with me everywhere.
