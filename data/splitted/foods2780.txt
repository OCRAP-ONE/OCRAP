review/text: Have tried several different oils from grocery. And when I took to the web to find oil to help give it that real Movie house taste, I knew already they normally use coconut oil. So was thrilled to find this. And knowing the benefits of Coconut oil, even though popcorn oil is not virgin coconut oil, I feel far better just using this. I HIGHLY recommend this product. Keep in mind to get a true movie house taste, you will want the FLAVACOL too. This is what adds that extra flavor of butter and salt.

review/summary: Absolutely the best!
review/text: I have used coconut oil for popcorn now for about 3 years and it is absolutely what the theaters use. I get the best popcorn in my 4oz popper machine by putting two tbl spoons of this in the kettle. I also throw in a little dash of flavacal salt/butter (or act-II popcorn salt/butter), and after popping, I put some odell super kist two buttery topping on top.<br /><br />Taste like my local theater, and plus my movie room smells like one after popping :)<br /><br />This is the best value I can find on coconut oil since it comes with free shipping from amazon!

Coconut oil is one of the healthiest oils on the planet. it has great disease fighting properties and cleansing, so those that see the 872 calories and flip out, don't worry, because it is all good for you. It's good enough for you that they have an annual coconut oil conference. i hope it catches back on and all the myths are wiped out.

review/text: We have purchased this product several times and are very pleased with it.  I have had to judge an amount to use with each batch of popcorn, but I have never had any trouble with the taste.  I have even discovered that as the carton gets empty, I can set it on top of my popcorn machine for a few hours and let it melt in order to get that "last little bit" left in the carton.  I also like that there is a big opening which makes it easier to get the product out rather than some little spout.

review/summary: Great taste and smell -update ... turns rancid after about 6 mos.
review/text: Making popcorn using this will give the movie theatre experience at home.  The aroma this coconut oil puts out when making popcorn just makes you hungry for freshly popped corn.  Will order again when we are almost out.  FYI  this will arrive in a melted state after being in the delivery truck all day in the hot sun and after it cools down inside the house it then becomes almost a paste.  It's okay like that and nothing is wrong with it ... just so you will know.<br /><br />Updating this and now giving it a 2 star from 5 stars.  This is my second batch and again I'm throwing this out because of the really weird taste and smell after having it for several months.  These jars tend to last about 6 months then go bad ... or just taste really bad.  At first the taste is great,  but now ... it's hard to explain.  I thought maybe my popcorn was going bad.  Cooked up a batch with regular oil and the popcorn is fine so it's the Coconut oil.  Would recommend this if the whole container would be used up fairly quickly.  Makes many batches so unless you are eating popcorn every single day this container will turn on you.  Maybe if the product were sold in smaller containers.  That would be great if did and I would buy again.

review/text: This is probably the best substance we have popped popcorn in. The corn was very fluffy, no duds, pretty non-greasy and none of the revolting taste that conventional cooking oils always manage to leave a hint of. It works especially well with the whirley-pop popper we just got. We didn't detect a "nutty" flavor, but then we didn't want that especially.

review/summary: Very good value.
review/text: This is just coconut oil and beta-carotene for color. The coloring is unimportant and is specifically for making popcorn look more appetizing.<br /><br />Coconut oil is the best oil for popping. It's also the same type of oil that is used at the movie theaters.<br /><br />Note that this product solidifies at 76* farenheit. Generally at room temperature it'll either be liquid or a shortening consistency depending on your climate. It does not require refrigeration - and if you do refrigerate it, it will become spoon-bending SOLID!<br /><br />You can still use it while it's solid or semi-solid, just scoop it into the popper. It will quickly liquify with little heat. If you feel you need to prewarm the whole container to liquify it, you can sit it on a shoe rack accessory for your clothes dryer if available (i.e. don't let it tumble around in the dryer) - just loosen the cap to allow air to escape as it will expand.<br /><br />You should not microwave the oil.

review/summary: OK--but not as fabulous as expected!
review/text: After reading reviews on several products designed for popping corn that renders a theatre-like taste to the popped product [without one having to add flavored salts or ancillary toppings], I decided that coconut oil would be the safest and most satisfactory route.  Paragon's gallon container of a coconut oil--specifically targeted at popcorn lovers--seemed the best choice.  And in many ways it probably is, but it has some aspects that disappointed: [1] The container of oil arrived on a 66-degree day in a near solid form (way more solid than a can of vegetable shortening);  [2] Its heavy jar is awkward to maneuver and the small mouth of the jar makes it quite difficult to "scoop out"/extract three tablespoons of the product;  [3] As this coconut popcorn oil apparently becomes quite solid under 70F temperatures, one may not be able to easily transfer the contents to more user-friendly containers;  [4] In three comparison popping sessions, this Paragon oil left more un-popped kernels than did vastly lower-priced, pure canola oil; and  [5] Lastly, the popped flavor of this coconut oil indeed is good but not stellar,  Crisco's pure canola oil left a lighter and not unappealing taste.

review/summary: Popcorn has never tasted so good!
review/text: I needed a new popcorn popping pan which I purchased from Amazon just before Christmas. In the add it mentioned trying Coconut oil for popping popcorn. I never heard of this oil, so I checked it out on Amazon. The Coconut oil had great reviews so I purchase some to give it a try. Well, popcorn has never tasted so good and I use only about a teaspoon to pop about six quarts at a time.  My wife said that I should not use this oil because it is a hard solid based oil and not a liquid oil like Olive oil. She said it has trans-fat and not good for you, I told her that I only use so little Coconut oil and that I can't believe it would clog anyones arteries. The Coconut oil came in such a large container that I have given small containers of it to members in my family too try and they all say it works wonders with popcorn. Today I was watching the Dr. OZ show on my television January 25, 2011 and Dr. OZ said that Coconut oil has gotten a bad rap and that it is as good as Olive oil. He said it has trans fat but that it will not clog your arteries in fact it is very good for you. Dr.OZ stated that the molecules in the Coconut oil are shorter and  different than other solid oils and great for frying too.  Dr.OZ gave seven ways to use this oil and that it is great for cooking and has a great taste to. So keep on popping your popcorn with Coconut oil and enjoy the great flavor it adds to you foods.

review/text: I ordered this twice because the first came with the lid broken into pieces and the jar was open to the elements.  The box was damaged as well but there wasn't enough packing to protect.  It was fulfilled by Amazon and shipped by them as well.  The second one arrived packed differently and was intact.  The product is of a very high quality and the seller of the second one charged less (Amazon wouldn't do a simple replacement of the first - I had to return it for a credit and then reorder).  The product is dense and must be scooped out of the jar to use.  It has a very pleasant taste by itself and cooks at high heat needed for popcorn without burning and without very much smoke.  It gives the popcorn a very nice aroma and adds to the taste somewhat.  This is the real thing for making movie theater popcorn.  A little melted promise margarine makes the final product just like the movie theater taste.  (I asked several local theaters what they use to butter and they all used Promise margarine).  Very good product.

review/text: This is essential for movie theater tasting popcorn. I put in 2 small spoon fulls of this oil, in with 1/2 a cup of popcorn kernals, put in microwave bowl, and I get popcorn that I can't tell the difference between home or movie theater...<br /><br />No joke. Add popcorn salt to give a little salt to taste, and it gives a little yellow coloring as well...<br /><br />Very good stuff.

review/summary: Awesome Stuff...Great Price !!
review/text: Not much I can add to the rave reviews, except I totally agree! It is a great value for money, melts nicely and has that slightly nutty taste that adds to the movie theater flavor of popcorn. It arrived promptly, well-packed and sealed. It is enough to last forever [just for popcorn] so I plan to experiment with using it to saute potatoes, stirfry, etc. Do not be bothered by the solid nature of this oil in cool temps. That is simply the nature of coconut oil. It will be liquid at about 76 degrees, as others have said. Not a problem. Just keep in a cool place. A dark pantry is ideal. No need to refrigerate.<br />  I highly recommend buying this.

review/summary: Necessary Ingredient
review/text: I started my quest for good homemade popcorn about a year ago. I tried all of the variations of stove, microwave, plus I bought a small movie theatre style popcorn maker. I was still getting half popped and unpopped kernals of mediocre taste. During my research I read that coconut oil was needed as it could best handle the hi-temp needed for popping popcorn. I finally sprung for the coconut oil and it has made all the difference in the world. The same popcorn I was using now popped larger and nearly all kernals popped. Some reviewers said they were disappointed with the lack of buttery flavor. The oil never claims to and I never expected it to but it does give it that movie theatre taste. I only add salt no extra butter. The only problem for me is that it tastes too good.

review/summary: Excellent taste and texture!
review/text: My family used to eat a lot of pasta, and so when I found out that I'm gluten intolerant, it was a big change to our diet. I've tried several brands of gluten-free pasta (some all rice, some with corn, some with quinoa, etc.) and none of them tasted even close to wheat pasta and they tended to be somewhat mushy/slimy in texture. I was pretty sure we were going to have to give up pasta for good .<br /><br />My local supermarket recently starting carrying the Hodgson Mill brand, and so I figured I'd give it a try. It was fantastic! Texture is excellent (more firm than most gluten-free pasta, though a little softer than wheat pasta, but not slimy at all!), and the taste is as close to wheat pasta as it gets. My husband and daughter both said, "Wow, this is really good!" So of course, I bought several boxes the next time I went shopping.<br /><br />My husband actually cooked with this other night, and he said that it was super easy (even though he wasn't paying attention and it got a little overcooked, it was still delicious).

review/text: I received this item the other day and every single can in the box was dented.  Not sure if this was a fluke thing or if it's normal since this was the first time ordering these.<br /><br />Also, my 20 month old daughter who eats everything under sun would NOT eat these.  I'm not sure if she didn't like the taste or if she just has to get use to them.  She LOVED her Gerber raviolis and since she ate so many of them I wanted to try and go organic but she can't seem to swallow these (no pun in tended).  I'm going to try a couple more times and if she won't eat them I will probably go back to Gerber brand.  Maybe my 5 month old son will like them when he's old enough.

review/summary: Best diced tomatoes ever!
review/text: I really love these hunts diced tomatoes with green peppers, celery and onion. Hunts and Amazon did a good job packaging the cans so that my four cases arrived safely without any severe dents to any of the cans. I'm stocking up on canned tomatoes because Amazon has a marvelous price of $10.53 a case or around $0.88 per can, which is $0.33 cheaper per can than my local grocery store and I receive the added convenience of having them delivered right to my home.  I've read news reports that the prices of tomatoes will be going up from 15% to 20% in the coming months because of inflation and supply shortages so I want to make sure to have a nice supply.<br /><br />  I've had other brands of diced tomatoes and they are usually overly filled with juice or contain harmful ingredients like "high fructose corn syrup" Hunts quality can't be beat,these cans are filled with tasty healthy tomatoes with very small amounts of liquid to drain. I use them mostly with black beans for mixing my own low cost salsa ^_^<br /><br />  I do wish they made their cans like Libbys which are made to stack on top of each other, Hunts cans are difficult to stack.<br /><br /> Enjoy!

review/summary: Good consistency, but sugar added?
review/text: This product has a real nice consistency: a lot of firm matter inside, not so much water as in some other alternatives. However, I noticed it's kinda smooth and sweetish, and lo and behold, one of the ingredients is sugar. Wth? Sugar? Why add sugar to a canned tomato product? Not too much, about 1 g per serving more than my usual brand I get locally (according to the label), but you can feel it. I'm not sure why they added sugar, and I don't like it. Sugar aside, this would be five stars (online price is quite good too, although sometimes locally it's on sale and costs even less than here). I'm not sure I'll re-order... I'll continue searching for sugarless alternatives.<br /><br />Added on 02/19/2012: When I posted this, I said the online price was good, well, it surely isn't good now at near two bucks a pop! You can always get this sort of product at about a buck a can, +- a few cents, so use that as a guideline. The prices here jump a lot, so keep that in mind when you read reviews: a price a reviewer mentions may not be the one that's currently displayed here.

It just adds more calories and hardly to boost to the taste. I recommended to anyone who has a garlic lover in the household and needs to makes a quick dip for a party. Also, try the dip with plain kettle cooked chips. Very delicious.

review/summary: Eczema relief for baby -- Talc and Corn starch free!
review/text: When my baby started rolling over and sleeping on her stomach, she would wake up from naps and bedtime even more flared up than during the day. I wanted a talc and corn starch free alternative and found this product that claimed to provide eczema relief. I use it as part of my baby's daily regimen to help our fight against her eczema flare ups. I do not use it in her diaper area (I use raw shea butter to keep her diaper area rash free, check out my listmania for more info on the shea butter that I use.) I use this dusting powder on her chest, stomach, back of knees and right across her belly button along her sides where the pamper is tightest because of the straps. This dusting powder is very gentle and helps keep a barrier between her sensitive skin and any friction arising from her pamper, clothes or simply her rolling around on her stomach while sleeping.

review/summary: Works great!
review/text: This product works wonderful when coupled with chemical free diapers. Our little girl is 3 months old and we have only had one bout with diaper rash- which happened before we had this powder. I agree with others that the packaging isn't the best, but the benefits outweigh this for us. It is hard to break the plastic tab on top and the sprinkle holes get clogged so you could be there all day trying to get enough out. We set it to half of the large opening and gently tap- seems to work good this way:) Got this 2 pack first through Amazon and it seems they don't have this anymore. Unfortunately,we have had to find this elsewhere for a more reasonable price. It is worth shopping around for.

As a child I enjoyed this product. I never forgot its unique taste. I knew it was made in England but that was all I could remember. Now, fifty years later, thanks to modern technology, I can once again enjoy this  candy. The service from the source was excellent. I shall order again.

review/text: I started with 8 oz. of this product at first.  I loved it so much, I worked my way up to the 3-lb. bag in a relatively short time.  I use it in smoothies with coconut milk kefir, banana, carob powder, vanilla extract and stevia.  YUM!!!  I also blend hempseeds into my salad dressing recipes for a creamy, delicious dressing.<br /><br />I love the fact that the hempseeds stay fresh in the freezer for months.  I put some in a jar and keep it in the refrigerator so it's ready for me to use when I need it.

review/summary: Hemp for breakfast
review/text: Nutiva Organic Hempseed is a high quality prodcut. Hemp seeds are high in protein and essential amino acids with an omega-6 to omega-3 EFA ratio of about 3:1. I use about three tablespoons in my breakfast smootie every day so a 5lbs bag will last me about four months. I portion about about a month's worth, reseal the bag and keep it in the freezer so the seeds are still fresh by the time it's emptied. Good stuff!

They taste just as good as the ones I bought from my local health food store, and I love that I was able to buy them in bulk for a much better price online. Just make sure that you have a large container for storing them after opening if you do not have a way to re-seal the package.

They also fill me up so that I don't need to eat a big meal for lunch if I've had them for breakfast.  I typically cut up half a banana, take 2 Tbsp of raw, unpasteurized yogurt and 3 - 4 Tbsp of hemp seed and mix together.  Homemade banana yogurt with hemp seeds....great breakfast.

review/summary: I must have received a bad batch
review/text: I have purchased hemp seeds many times, and count them as a large part of my diet. I typically purchase the Manitoba Harvest brand, but the price on the 5 pound bag with Subscribe & Save was unbeatable. The hemp seeds I received looked and smelled normal, but sent my GI tract into a nightmare. I thought it was a fluke, and had nothing to do with the hemp seeds, so I ate them again a few days later, when I was feeling better. Within 30 minutes of eating, I was vomiting profusely, with terrible stomach pain. I wonder perhaps if there was some ecoli (or similar) bacteria on the seeds. I tossed the rest of the $50 bag. I won't buy Nutiva brand again.

review/summary: Great Expectations not Realized
review/text: I had great expectations when I purchased these hemp hearts as someone at our local health food store was very enthusiastic about its ability to cut appetite and thus worked for weight loss and control  I found it pleasent to eat, tastes fine and texture is appealing although the seeds get caught in my teeth and under my gums so I need to brush, rinse and floss quickly after eating it.  I was surprise to read the fat content at 45 percent so I am only eating it with breakfast.  I don't think this is any miracle food supplement and probably will not buy again unless something changes with my experience.  I've used it for a month now with no noteable impact.

review/summary: Good Milk Subsitiute
review/text: Plenty of time to use before exp. date.(close to a year give or take) The flavor is very mild and won't throw off the taste of your recipe's.<br /><br /> I usually keep it in the freezer to keep it fresh. Follow storage insturctions on package. It will start to get an strong flavor as it starts to go bad. (just like flax or any other perishable food) I noticed that once when leaving some in the frige too long. (a couple of months)<br /><br />Mostly I use it for a subsitiute for milk. Just add water and/or other ingredients and blend. Great for drinking, cooking, and making "milk shakes". Or you could just use it as a sprinkle on your salads.

review/text: Hello,  I started to eat a little healthier, so I have to buy hemp seeds.  I am a Nutiva's consumer for 2 years now (coconut oil), so I know their product quality, and I wouldn't buy any other brand than Nutiva. I used few times a day: in my morning protein shake, with plain yogurt and in my strawberry smoothie. I need to loose weight, but I am not in a diet yet, but I lost 7LBS in 2.5 weeks. Like I said, I am not in a diet. I am not exercising, so I believe is the hemp seeds.<br /><br />For those of you who are trying to loose weight, I highly recommend you to buy the Hood� Calorie Countdown Fat Free Dairy Beverage. It only has 35 calories x serving, and  it has all vitamins and everything else than milk.  Google it.

review/text: I've had hemp seeds before, purchased at my local natural foods market (navitas brand, I believe) and enjoyed it very much.  In contrast, Nutiva in the 5 lb bag, was disappointing to say the least.  Poor taste, plus a horrible burn all the way down my throat.  I'm not allergic to hemp, in fact consume hemp milk every day, so this was quite a surprise.  Unfortunately I did not keep the packaging, since I had immediately transferred the seeds to glass containers to prepare for freezing.  These seeds are going in the compost bin (hope it doesn't burn the worms!)

review/text: I have enjoyed Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed for three years.  But I just received a three pound bag that was puffed up with air.  When I opened it up, it still smelled like hemp seed so I took a bite and swallowed it.  Not only did it taste bitter, but it burned my throat!  Amazon is refunding my money and I am going to try a different brand of hemp seed.  I suspect improper packaging or storage which is a shame because Nutiva's product is really good when it is fresh.

review/text: I ordered this product based on good reviews like 2 months ago and i really loved it and I ordered another 3 pound bag a month later, the second bag was just not right, I thought i must be a bad batch or something because it had more green shells in it and the seeds looked more brownish, it had this bitter burning taste. I called amazon and they said they would send me another ( i really did not wanna give up on it so i wanted to try another), same thing. I called again and they said they would send me another just to make sure that it was not a fluke. I got the bag 2 days ago and the same thing :(  finally i gave up on it. I will look in to another brand. I am really curious if other people are having the same issue..
