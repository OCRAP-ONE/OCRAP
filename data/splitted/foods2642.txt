review/summary: Light, crispy and delicious, but very delicate!
review/text: Well, my title says it all.  Schar is my absolute favorite for all things gf, and these crackers are fantastic like everything else of theirs.  They have a light and crispy texture and have a mild toasted flavor much like a saltine (but not salty).  The only drawback is how brittle they are.  I've bought them from Amazon and other gf warehouses and they arrive in many pieces every time - you will seldom get a whole cracker in a package.  And if you can get a large enough piece, it likely won't stay in one piece while you are handling it, and forget about trying to spread anything on it.  Doesn't stop me from buying them though as they are a lot like the gluten-filled varieties of crackers in terms of taste and texture.  I will make little hard-cheese "sandwiches" out of the pieces, and they are excellent to eat if you don't feel well.  Probably not a good item to use for entertaining though.

review/summary: crackers great shipping awful
review/text: The crackers taste great.  They arrived in terrible condition.  The big box held a smaller cardboard box containing bread and the crackers were just shrink wrapped and placed in the box with a few air packs. The filler offered no protection to the crackers. I think the movement caused them to be reduced to the broken state they arrived in.If they were in a box as the bread was maybe they would arrive whole. I would order again, but alone and hope for better packing.

review/summary: Good taste, but brittle
review/text: I ordered the 6pk of these crackers. I've had them in the past and wanted some crackers to go with the Chicken soup I was planning to make.<br /><br />I like the neutral taste of the crackers. They aren't salty. They are very brittle though. Every package will have some broken or completely crushed crackers in it. If you are using them in a recipe that is perfect. However if you want to put something on the crackers, they will usually break into pieces when you dip them or put spreads on them unless you are very careful.

review/summary: The Best GF Crackers Available!
review/text: I gave these crackers only 4 stars because of their packaging (or lack thereof).  Although they taste delicious -- a cross between a saltine and a ritz for all the gluten-eaters -- only a few of them remain whole, or even semi-whole.  The majority of the crackers are crumbled into bits.  Schar tried to prevent this by wrapping the craker packages in corrugated cardboard, but it really doesn't do the job.  My kids still enjoy the tiny pieces but a good deal of it is just too small to eat, so I save it for breading or fillers (like in meatloaf).  Buying them on amazon is much cheaper than the other health food stores in my area, who charge between $6 and $9 dollars per package!  I buy these every few months from amazon and will continue to do so as they are also milk and egg-free, which I need.  I just wish they arrived in better condition, then I would give them 5 stars.

review/summary: Good But Pricey
review/text: I think this is new on the market and got a free sample.  It tastes delicious like Pina Colada but not too sweet/heavy, low-cal and uses sucralose (aka Splenda) which is closer to natural sugar and supposedly better for you then aspartame (NutraSweet), (would be even better with stevia).  But at $2.50 a pop, that's $75 to get your Vitamin D each month.  Still if you are into fufu nutritional drinks and you got the money to spend, this is one of the better ones I've run across.  If I could get it for under $2 a pop, I could get hooked on it. These guys are obviously competing with the likes of Vitamin Water which comes in 20 oz bottles instead of 14.5 and can be had for cheaper.  Interesting bottle shape though.  They'll have to probably drop the price or say bye bye, at least in this economy.

review/summary: Bottled Sunshine
review/text: Bottled sunshine is a beautiful idea. It strides the border between science fiction and Saturday morning cartoons. To think you could go to your grocery store and buy this or order cases of it online brings a smile to my face. But is Neurosun as a beverage the equal of Neurosun as a concept? The taste, which is that of a pina colada flavored Dum Dum pop is cloying. The effects, when compared to Neurogasm or Neurosleep are marginal at best. You feel good after drinking Neurosun and it has some things that your body needs, but it's one of the less useful Neuro drinks available. Bottled sunshine is a beautiful idea, but Neurosun is not really what you expect when you look for bottled sunshine.

review/summary: Good nutrition, but my cats will not eat it
review/text: I brought home two bengal kittens (12 weeks old) and after a bunch of research, decided on this dry food by Wellness.  It offers high quality meat, excellent ingredients overall, low carbs, etc.  The problem is that neither of my kittens will touch the stuff.  This seems to be a common problem too, because in the latest "Bengals Illustrated", they gave Wellness a very low rating in terms of desirability to cats (i.e., how much they like it).  Too bad. Also, one must consider the recent recall of Wellness food (their canned food actually, but same company).  Can we trust them?

review/text: This dry food is great!  My kitten (5 mos. old) has been eating it since I brought her home when she was just 8 weeks old.  I bought it because it is a good quality food that I feel safe feeding to my little one.  She eats this along with Wellness wet food.  Her coat is beautiful and she's had no health problems.  She is not overweight so I think this is a good food to control weight if your cat is self-fed.  It is of course pricier than other brands but I am willing to pay that to know that my kitten is eating healthy, high-quality food.

review/summary: Good ingredients, reasonable price, kittens tolerate it
review/text: I did a bunch of research on cat foods, and realized that although wet food was recommended (no grain, more moisture), I was not available to provide my kittens the frequent feedings they would need throughout the day, so I decided that leaving out wellness kitten health dry food and supplementing that with wellness canned food for breakfast and dinner was a good compromise.<br /><br />Why Wellness in particular?  It has more quality muscle meat and less grain than most dry cat foods, it is one of several dry foods that are recommended by cat dieticians (do your own research on the web, you'll see), it's not insanely expensive, and it is widely available, both online and in local pet shops.<br /><br />This approach has worked well so far.  The kittens were used to an exclusive diet of Royal Canin dry food (which is awful stuff) when I took them home, so it took a few weeks of mixing the wellness dry food with Roayal Canin dry food to get them to accept it.  Wellness has *much* better ingredients than Royal Canin though, so it was worth the effort.  They actually got to the point where now they were sifting through the mixture of both foods to pull out just the Wellness bits, so I knew it was time to stop mixing.<br /><br />Now I've got them on an all-wellness diet things are going very well.  Their poo's are firm (which is not the case for many bengal kittens), they enjoy the food, and I have the satisfaction of knowing that I am giving them something of really good quality.

review/summary: Very Dissappointed wtih recent Wellness company news
review/text: Today, I discovered that the Wellness company (Wellpet) was recently acquired by Berwind [...], an investment management company with a portfolio primarily consisting of coal mining and chemical corporations. My personal beliefs are very much centered around conservation, the environment, and supporting clean and sustainable energy industries so to find this news out is quite a blow. I actively try my best to avoid supporting the dirty industries of this world, therefore I'll no longer be buying Wellness products as difficult as it may be:<br /><br />For the last 6 years I have fed my cats Wellness dry & wet cat food with excellent results.  Last year, my cat Isaac passed away. He was a special needs cat since a kitten and as an adult cat, many vets told me repeatedly that I should probably put him to sleep due to his condition (various over the years: arthritis, megacolon, leg paralysis, neurological issues, & urinary tract infections). Isaac wasn't supposed to live past 16 years old but thanks to a Wellness diet and lots of love, he lived to the old age of 22.

review/summary: misses the mark
review/text: I switched our 10 week old kitten from Science Diet Kitten to Wellness Kitten because she had the runs from the 1st day we adopted her. The shelter first said she never had diarrhea, then admitted she got the runs when she was spayed 2 days before we picked her up. So we are dealing with the unknown. Two stool tests were negative so we feel this might be food-related. This kitten was also being fed wet food with the kibble (Purina Pro Plan Kitten) I did some online research and decided to stop the dry food as it contained grains which is very bad for the runs. And I also stopped the Wellness dry as it has grains. The diarrhea has lessened, but it's been 2 weeks now & I'm still stumped. I did add some dry baby rice cereal into her canned food, and also include a capsule of probiotics (spread out over 4 daily meals). She had a more formed stool today, so maybe she's turning the corner.<br /><br />I also question Wellness putting vegetables/fruits in this kitten food! These are NOT foods cats would eat in the wild. Is this just another company trying to make a buck off us by putting in things we know are good for human health? That would be the ultimate con job. I truly don't think cats need to eat fruits & veggies, so Wellness is fast going to the bottom of my feeding list of good foods for cats.<br /><br />In fact, almost all cat food companies put out junk food for our beloved forever friends!<br />I will continue to try to find something more appropriate for this kitten, and another kitten, adopted a week later, from a different litter (and w/no digestive issues - she was/still is being fed Petsmart brand Authority wet & dry - the dry contains grains/corn, but I won't switch her as her digestion works great on it)<br /><br />Wellness came highly recommended to me, but my search for a grain-free/veggie/fruit-free/wheat-free kitten dry kibble continues....so Wellness Kitten kibble is off my list. I will try their canned Kitten formula but not easy to find thus far.

review/summary: BEWARE OF BPA IN INFANT FORMULA CANS
review/text: I fed this to my premature babies since this is what the hospital gave to them when they were born.  I continued to use the ready to use cans thinking that it was the best for them, since the powder formula "is not sterile."  My babies have had problems with gas, indigestion, reflux, spitting/vomitting all the time they were on this formula.  I just thought it was what all babies go through and didn't want to switch to a different formula again.  I recently switched over to the powder formula, and they seem so much better.  It's like I turned off a switch....amazing.  I can't say that I'm 100% sure it's the metal cans, but my instinct tells me that the BPA they used to line the cans made them sick.<br /><br />There's a growing concern over the BPA used in infant formula cans (and other canned foods).  BPA is used to line the cans in order to "preserve" the formula...and giving it a longer shelf life.  BPA is commonly found in plastic containers/bottles, and there's a movement to remove BPA from baby bottles because of its adverse effects on infants.  If babies ingest BPA, it can cause developmental problems in the brain and reproductive system.  The latest studies show that the level of BPA in metal formula cans is so much higher than what is found in baby bottles.  There's more information online (check out the Environmental Working Group) about this issue, and as a concerned mother, I felt that I needed to let other mothers out there know about this.  I know that there are millions of mothers who know little or nothing about this issue.<br /><br />I get sick thinking about this.  At the very least, we have a responsibility to be informed when it concerns our babies.

It works out to $6.43/can compared to $6.19 per can at the lowest priced stores in my area.  Every once in a while Target sells this product for $5.50 a can but they sell out right away and don't restock for over a week.  I will continue to buy from Amazon unless they raise the price from $39 case.  I recommend it.

review/text: This is a great product I always buy them from trader Joe's when I stop in. At the store they only cost about a 1.85! at the price this retailer is asking I have to say stay away, unless you like throwing away money. I rate it as a 1 just because of the over pricing. buy it some place else!

review/summary: Crowd Pleaser
review/text: Greenies are the house crowd pleaser...my westie, who is NOT food oriented, will pull out every trick in her repertoire before I can ask to get one of these. My lab starts to drool when he sees one. My shihvanese practically does back flips! Everyone loves greenies. I like how they leave my dogs' breath sweet smelling and teeth clean. Easily digestible, senior formulas with joint help, great on their digestive system, just a great, great product! Can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />I will say though...if your dog is a gulper, please make sure you watch them while they eat/chew. They seem to like it so much that you really need to be on hand just in case, as is true with any chewy product for your furkids!

review/summary: Fresh and Clean!
review/text: My reaction was "wow!" the first time I gave these to my 8 year old lab.  His teeth were extremely dirty with what seemed like plaque or whatever it was on his teeth that I could not get rid of by brushing his teeth.  I thought I would need the vet to professionally clean his teeth.  I was amazed as to how his teeth became pearly white after a few of these greenies not to mention that his breath did not have a nasty smell either.  I give these to my 2 year old pup as well.  Her teeth have never been as dirty as my 8 year old's but at least her breath is fresher too.<br /><br />5 STARS ALL THE WAY!

review/summary: Go away bad doggy breath!
review/text: My dogs don't have terribly stinky breath and I have Greenies to thank for it. I've tried the knock-off products and to be honest they don't seem as well made, plus  my dogs actually seem less excited about them.<br /><br />I ended up buying the large Greenies (pkg of 8) for two reasons. One, the price-point seemed right and two, I have two dogs (60+ lb catahoula leopard dog and a 10 lb terrier mix) and its easy to break the large Greenie into two portions for them. One packages last us about 1 month (1-2 Greenies / week).<br /><br />Our dogs really do love these things. If we present them with the option of a Greenie versus some other treat (say a bone) they invariably take the Greenie.

review/summary: deadly
review/text: 1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous and Deadly, May 25, 2006<br /><br />I have two beagles who love to chew, and greenies are highly compressed which woule make it a good optionfor my dogs. However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse.<br /><br />If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a "busy ball". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy balls let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety.<br /><br />If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie.<br /><br />Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly.<br /><br />While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies.<br /><br />I am actually surprised amazon even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to amazon users to petition them to stop selling it.

review/summary: Great deal!
review/text: This is a great deal - you get a large 16 oz bag of high quality Bay Leaf.  A friend of mine decided to buy one bag and split it between us because the quantity was more than either one of us wanted for our regular cooking needs, so the deal got even better after that!<br /><br />This is good fresh Bay Leaf with nice strong flavor. Given the quantity one might be tempted to use more Bay leaf than the recipe calls for, but the flavor gets stronger as you cook and too much of a good thing, in this case, is not a good thing.<br /><br />Bay leaves release their flavor during slow cooking so I like adding bay leaves to casseroles, stews, soups, marinades, and pasta sauces.  I also add it to the steamer when I steam vegetables, fish, seafood, or chicken. Bay leaves add nice flavor to the food with which they are cooked, but if you bite into them in the final dish they are not pleasant to taste. I always make sure to remove the leaves when the dish finished cooking. It is easier to do when you use whole bay leaf as they are easier to see when time comes to remove them.<br /><br />I recommend this product!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

I use them a lot when cooking soups, stews, chili beans, and spaghetti sauce.

review/text: I use between 2 and 3 bay leaves a week. I was getting tired of paying 20 cents or so for one leaf or opening a jar from the grocery to find broken and damaged leaves. I was tempted to plant my own bay tree. I bought this bag figuring even if I threw some of the leaves out I would still be ahead of the game. These leaves are big, undamaged and wonderful. I keep the leaves in the freezer and just take a few out at a time.

review/summary: Me and my RC
review/text: A company called Chero-Cola Co. had a line of sodas called Royal Crown in 1905. They reformulated one of their products in 1934 and "Royal Crown Cola" was born. Consumers called it RC Cola for so long the company finally made it official. "ME and MY RC to taste mighty good to me" was a popular commerical in the 1970's. It is not available everywhere, so some people are lucky to find it this way on Amazon. A very popular cola in the south, I have heard southerners swear by drinking a glass with a few shelled peanuts in the soda, say it tastes great that way. I have also heard that the combination of a Moon-Pie and RC was big in the 1950's but sounds like too much suga for me. Either way the 1950's was their heyday and they spent tons on advertising especially with celebrity sponsors like Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.<br /><br />Packaging: It is sold in plastic, glass and cans and like many sodas the glass bottle tastes better but good luck finding it. SMOOTHNESS: It is more smooth than Coca-Cola, but more uppity than Pepsi. CARBONATION: RC has average carbonation, the big two colas are a bit more fizzy. SWEETNESS: It is a little lighter in sweetness than the 2 big colas. COLA Flavor: You can taste the cola pretty well.<br /><br />In 1954, it was the first brand to be sold in an all aluminum can, the first to offer a low calorie diet cola, and a caffeine free soda. Four years later, they introduced the first 16-ounce bottle.<br />Dr. Pepper/7Up company owns this now, and they in turn were bought by Cadbury Schweppes a British company in 2000, who seems to be buying up all the soda companies in the country with the exception for the big 2. Check out their web site.<br />Update: As of June 2, 2007, Cadbury Scweppes is selling off their soda division. Let's hope someone keeps the regional sodas alive.

They are a flavorful, small cracker; just enough for a bite or three in each small cracker.  The crunch is satisfying enough for even the staunchest carb lover.  The crackers are conveniently packaged in a resealable tub.  They don't last long around here once the tub has been opened though.  I have tried many, many, many crackers over the years and none have come close to the flavor and crunch that is packed into this tiny one.  I will stay on auto-ship for years to come.

review/text: If i could give this '0', i would.  i have been purchasing these krackers for over a year.  this last batch (which was 6 containers of krackers), was so bad, i ended throwing them out.  they were nothing but plain crackers.  the amount of pumpkin seeds and cheese, was so minimal, i had to dig thru the box to find 1 or 2 that i wanted to eat.  I will not be buying these again.  The quality has dropped 100%.

review/summary: Useful, but mix carefully
review/text: This has worked well for me on long runs, but be careful when mixing it up. If you follow their directions, it'll be about 2x too strong, and you'll gag when you drink it, and leave you feeling weird (not to mention the way your mouth will feel). Use about 1/3 to 2/3 of what they recommend, and you'll have something that's palatable, and still effective. Also, 1 scoop != 1 serving. A scoop is a little over a serving, so it's a bit harder than it needs to be to figure out nutrition info for this product.

review/text: I normally despise gatorade products! They make my stomach queasy and sick feeling on runs where gels are needed too. No, I never bothered experimenting with diff. gels because I love GU gels, so I switched my liquid instead. BUT---I ran Boston this spring and this is what they said they were serving, so I had to give it a go. I couldn't even believe how great it tasted !!!  And no queasiness at ALL. Mixed fantastic with the GU gels. This is probably better that any powdered drink mix I have used. Even better that GU brew. Better than my race performance, that's for sure ! :-))

review/summary: Very good for boxed pasta!
review/text: I'm glad I ordered this.  It cooks easily and fairly quick - just boil some water and put in the pasta, let it cook about 10 minutes and it's ready to eat!  If you like puffier pasta, you can just put this pasta in a small pan of boiling water and then turn the heat off.  The pasta will absorb the water and puff up without additional heat, and without making the pasta mushy.<br /><br />I like to prepare this and just stir in a bit of fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  No sauce is necessary.  It's even good cold when there are leftovers.  You can add anything to this pasta and expect a good meal.  I added some steamed chicken breast and it was very good.  I even tried it with steamed okra - tasted great.<br /><br />The Parmesan cheese filling is fairly light yet you can still taste it.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Best Salt/Spice Combo
review/text: This is indeed the best salt/spice combo I've ever found. Our family uses it in just about every dish. The combination of sea salt and garlic compliments just about every food we prepare. As the label says, it is "Great on chicken, steak, burgers, fish, pasta, soups, eggs and vegetables." It also rocks in soups, dips, some salads and sauces too. The convenience of having these two indispensable spices in one package saves time in the long run as well. The plastic mill is easy to use; just give it a few shakes, remove the cap and grind away. Ours lasts us up to six months. If you live in a humid climate like I do, the contents can start to stick a little, but I find a few sharp taps on the counter and some vigorous shaking loosens things right up.<br /><br />Salt and garlic lovers, look no further!

review/text: This is a really yummy option for adding just a touch of garlic to anything.  The garlic is dehydrated flakes of garlic not powdered garlic so it doesn't have the harsh taste of a regular garlic salt.  I live in a moist climate so eventually the remains of the jar clump but I will still buy this more of this product because I find it very handy.  It's my go-to salt for anything that will be improved by a little whiff of garlic, e.g. sauteed veggies.

review/summary: Great flavor--now I can include pasta in my eating plan again.
review/text: After reading all the reviews I decided I'd try this brand and another (Ancient Harvest).  I like pasta salad--and my husband loves it.  The biggest plus is the TASTE, very mild and yummy.  The biggest minus is it can be tricky getting it done just right, a minute to long and the pasta will fall apart on your plate.  So I'm learning as I go; I think slightly under-cooking it is preferable in all dishes.

It cooks with enough firm texture, unlike other gluten-free items that become too soggy or a mush.  The pasta goes well in Greek tomato-based dishes, in a pasta dish with only olive oil, sardines, garlic, and chili pepper flakes, as well as in casseroles and normal pasta dishes.  I'm glad I bought the five box package too.

review/summary: Hands down, the best brand available.
review/text: The gluten free community holds a few long standing favorites among pasta brands. Tinkyada is one, and this should be the other number one. This pasta holds up, not only to cooking, but to reheating and stirring. I was introduced to this brand a few years ago when a friend brought me a box of their zitis and I fell in love with them. At the time, they were not available in my local grocery stores, so I was not able to get them. However, my stores began carrying the brand and now Amazon is offering the discounts for bulk, which always makes a great deal even better.<br />The cooking time on these guys is a bit shorter than the standard for gluten free noodles, but it does not make it easy to over cook them, either. I enjoy this great pasta with herbs and butter, in pasta bakes, or slathered with red or white sauce.

review/summary: Flavorful Change
review/text: If you're looking for a flavorful change from boring bitter coffee this is perfect. Full of smooth body rich flavor from the first sip, this finishes with a great coffee taste without a bitter or "too strong" ending. I enjoy drinking my coffee black without the additives to cover up taste that just isn't that good. I find this is so good tasting that there is no need to add anything. I do not enjoy Starbucks because to get the flavor you also have to take the bitter and too strong with it. I want a full rich flavor without thinking I am drinking bitter espresso. I would recommend trying this Brazilian favorite and see what you are missing. A mere 6 level tablespoons makes a full 12 cup pot in my Cuisinart maker, so this ends up being quite reasonable in cost as well. 5 Star in my book.

review/text: This is a great deal - you get a large 16 oz bag of high quality Bay Leaf.  A friend of mine decided to buy one bag and split it between us because the quantity was more than either one of us wanted for our regular cooking needs, so the deal got even better after that!<br /><br />This is good fresh Bay Leaf with nice strong flavor. Given the quantity one might be tempted to use more Bay leaf than the recipe calls for, but the flavor gets stronger as you cook and too much of a good thing, in this case, is not a good thing.<br /><br />Bay leaves release their flavor during slow cooking so I like adding bay leaves to casseroles, stews, soups, marinades, and pasta sauces.  I also add it to the steamer when I steam vegetables, fish, seafood, or chicken. Bay leaves add nice flavor to the food with which they are cooked, but if you bite into them in the final dish they are not pleasant to taste. I always make sure to remove the leaves when the dish finished cooking. It is easier to do when use whole bay leaf as their easier to see when time comes to remove them.<br /><br />I recommend this product!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Amazingly flavorful bay leaves
review/text: This is a huge package, enough bay leaves to last for years--and supply all your friends. But it is worth it! I am utterly lavish with them in my soups and stews because I have so much of it, and the aroma and flavor it imparts is more exquisite than any bay leaf I've ever bought in the grocery store.<br /><br />If you decide to buy this one-pound package and are looking for some additional uses for your large supply of bay leaves, here are some ideas:<br /><br />According herbal healers, bay leaves are an excellent digestive aid. This means when you cook with them, they also help you digest the meal you've prepared! When eating food you have not cooked with bay leaves or have acquired somewhere else, instead of taking antacids for indigestion, you can chew on a bay leaf. It helps with stomach cramps and with gas. (By the way, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ZZGG2">fennel seeds</a> are great for digestion and gas relief too. Just as for bay leaves, you chew on them.)<br /><br />The aroma of bay leaves is a natural repellent to ants, moths, and grain worms. If you put a bay leaf in your flour, rice, or cereal container, it will protect them from bugs. (Cayenne pepper makes a great pest repellent as well. Sprinkle it around where ants come into your house, and place it on your garbage can to repel squirrels and raccoons.)<br /><br />Bay leaf is also known by herbalists as an anti-dandruff remedy, and it helps with dry scalp, too. Place 5-10 crushed bay leaves in 4 cups of boiling water and seep for 30 minutes. Drain the cooled liquid into a plastic container (you don't want to take glass into your shower) and pour it over your hair as an after-shampoo rinse.<br /><br />Bay leaves also make a good-smelling addition to homemade potpourris.

review/text: Just so you know, this is a LOT of bay leaves. Like a restaurant-sized bag of them. I figured since they're about $5 for a tiny jar at the store, and this being Amazon, my ~13 dollars would get me the equivalent of 4 or 5 jars. Think more like 40 or 50.<br /><br />I cook a lot and this is still like a 5 year supply. Maybe longer.<br /><br />I can't really complain about it. Just be sure to order a large storage tin to go with these puppies.

review/summary: WOW! LIFETIME SUPPLY OF THE FRESHEST BAY LEAVES I EVER BOUGHT!
review/text: The title say it all! This is as others have stated.. A huge amount of bay leaves!!! I went to local store where I shop and have been paying about $5.00 for a small jar of bay leaves, size was 0.10/oz. So I got tired of getting ripped off and bought this large amount approx. 160X the amount for about $12.00 ... I gave some to my whole family and still have in my guess A lifetime supply left!! The best part was the super fresh smell that you never seem to get in those store jars, so that was A very welcomed extra bonus!! When I bought this on amazon my thinking was even if I only use A small amount of them I was getting my moneys worth and I did not care if I ever used the remaining amount. I also thought it would be nice to share this with my family so they could also share in the savings. If you give someone A single ounce of bay leaves it is still A huge amount! I zip locked baged them and sucked the air out and I would guess they should be good for years to come!! I hope this has helped someone in some small way??
