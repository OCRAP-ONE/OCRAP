review/summary: Not Your Average Season Salt...
review/text: Season salt is sort of a staple ingredient in most of my soups and stews.  I like the fact that its salt with a little dash of onion powder, garlic, and paprika to name a few included.  I will admit however that in most cases I settle for whatever season salt is available at the local dollar store or market.  Then one time while attending a local seafood festival I came across this Badia blend on a condiments table.  I sprinkled a little of it on my fried clams and was quite surprised at the zestiness of its flavor.  I was certainly no stranger to season salt at that time, but this was a blend that was definitely a cut above the dollar store offering, or the Lawrys or McCormick blends that are familiar in stores.  I was surprised to find Badia so easily in local markets.  I had never spotted it before.  I now buy it regularly, and use it sparingly.  For as deliciously sharp and zesty as it is, its also quite expensive compared to any other season salt I have come across.  Fortunately a little of it goes a long ways, and is just delicious enough for season salt aficionados to appreciate its flavor over its premium price.  If you fit into that category, I highly recommend this Badia blend.  If you enjoy or regularly use season salt, you will not be disappointed in this one.  (Just remember to use it sparingly until you get used to it). If you can't find it locally, its a fair price they are offering for it here on Amazon.  Unfortunately it only comes two pounds at once that will last you years, and with a hefty shipping charge thrown in by the current available sellers. I guess it depends on what you consider is a worthwhile price for what is in my opinion the best I have ever had.  All around its a superior season salt...

review/summary: Rival the Best Lemon Bars from Scratch
review/text: I love lemon bars, but they take time to make. Someone gave me the Barefoot Contessa's Lemon Bar mix and it definitely cuts down on the time needed from start to eating. But in addition, it is a great lemon bar. The shortbread is buttery and the right texture, and the lemon is tart and delicious. You do have to add more than just oil, water, and eggs, but the result is fantastic.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Lovely Tart Lemon Bar
review/text: This is a nice lemon bar. It is nice and tart (you use the juice of 3 lemons)<br />It is a multi-step process (my other half thought it was alot of work for a mix -- I will let u decide)<br />You mix 1 3/4 cups of butter with the crust mix.  Press into a 9x13 pan.  Put in the refridgerator for 30 minutes.<br />Then bake the crust for 15 minutes.  Then let the crust cool.<br />You then beat 5 eggs, the juice of 3 lemons and the filling mix. Pour the filling mix on top of the crust, bake for 30 minutes.<br />Then let it cool.  Once cool sprinkle powdered sugar on top.

review/summary: Delicious and delicate, if you like vanilla wafer cookies, and love lemon...can't beat it!
review/text: These are absolutely delicious...the best way I can think of to describe these cookies is to compare them to your run of the mill wafer cream cookies, but these are more delicate and the little waffley pockets on the cookies are smaller, kind of like the inside of a kit kat bar. Now, imagine that but in lemon. So essentially, if you like wafer cookies, lemon, or the inside of a kit kat you will like these cookies...I think they are soooo yummy, and usually I have 1/2 a pack as a serving and save the rest for later, I recommend storing them in plastic, or wrapped in press n seal though, or they get stale if you just fold over the pack. These can be hard to find locally, so I'm realy glad Amazon sells them! Soooo delicious for lemon lovers you can't beat these!

review/summary: Spearmint licorice lover---terribly disappointed
review/text: I love spearmint licorice, especially the twisters and after a lot of research I was excited to find a site that was able to satisfy my yearning.<br />The packaging of the licorice was very flimsy, very hard to get off the licorice. Once you are able to get the thin cello off the licorice you are met with very hard, and impossible to take the licorice apart to eat. What little you could break off was hard and stale. Very disappointed in the product and am even more disappointed with the way the company has handled it (or I should say hasn't handled it) I contacted them and they haven't bothered responding to my correspondance. We paid a premium price for the licorice 8.99 a package and ended up throwing out the total product because it was simply unacceptable and impossible to enjoy. So, on two notes , I would be cautious about ordering from them, because there is a chance they won't bother to answer your correspondance and secondly the product they delivered us wasn't remotely like the old fashioned spearmint licorice that we enjoyed as kids. Be warned.

review/summary: Oily, yellow, and disgusting...
review/text: I recently created a candy buffet for 150+ people for a work event, and 2 items went over extremely poorly.  This was, by far, the worst.  The colors for the candy buffet were red, white, and blue - and these appeared to be white in the picture.  Unfortunately, they were not even close to white.  They were a sickly looking yellowish color instead.<br /><br />Because I didn't have a lot of time and I needed every item I had ordered, I went ahead and put these out (I stuck them in back behind some other stuff).  People still managed to find them, pick them up with disgusted looks, and laugh as they yelled things like "Who brought the rancid licorice??" and, "What the #*$ is this??"  It was an after-hours party, as you can probably guess :)<br /><br />The worst part is that the candy was extremely oily, and even at room temperature, it seemed to "sweat" even more oil.  I've never seen anything like it.  I'm not sure anyone ever got around to tasting them, but my guess is that they weren't good, given the odd smells and texture.

If you have ever been to Georgia, these are as close as you can get to the licorice they sell at Stone Mountain. Nice!

review/summary: A bit too sweet
review/text: The concept is great. My concern is how sugary they are. "No sugar added"- true....sorta. They use concentrated apples which is effectively adding sugar, just not the heavily processed variety.<br /><br />At just over 3oz, each pouch has 12.3g of sugar. Granted that's not a whole lot, but I've been seeing more and more of this type of thing pop up. They tout it as no-sugar-added but they'll stir in a ton of concentrated pear or grape juice which is loaded with sugar! Fructose or glucose, it's all the same in your bloodstream.<br /><br />We've been giving our daughter unsweetened applesauce and now tasting this stuff it's dramatically more sweet. If you don't want your children to have sugar/get used to sugary tasting foods, then this is not the applesauce for you.<br /><br />Otherwise, the product is fantastic. I'd just like to see a more natural tasting version.

review/summary: Great Snack!
review/text: I love these!  My two year old son takes them in his lunch to mother's day out.  I had been buying the Plum, Revolution and Ellas babyfood in the pouches so that he could have a fruit or vegetable in his lunch that he could feed himself without making a mess for his teachers to clean up.  I decided to give these a try because they are much less expensive.  They are definitely worth it!  Purchased in bulk they end up being about $.70 each compared to the $1 plus for the other brands I had been purchasing.  My son loves them and doesn't make any mess AT ALL!  I even trust him to eat them in the car on roadtrips.  The only reason I did not give five stars is that I wish they were a little larger serving and would love to purchase a bulk variety pack.  We have 48 of one flavor!

review/summary: Kids #1 grab for a healthy snack
review/text: We recently discovered these in the appleapple (at Costco) and decided to take a chance on the applepeach thanks to the lower price and another reviewer here mentioning they liked both of those flavors. These taste much better than a store brand we tried. Without actually having both around at once, my kids say they think the peach and apple taste about the same. I actually think the peach is more tart, and I'm going to get the 48 pack of appleapple next time. Having tried apple-strawberry and apple-banana in the store brand, I'm not going to risk those flavors in a 48-pack, even though I'm sure GoGo SqueeZ would taste a least a little better. One of my kids hated the strawberry and neither really liked the banana (although I think I would personally like the GoGo banana).<br /><br />These are super-convenient and the kids grab them first for their lunches and healthy snacks. I would give them 5 stars if they were just a little bigger. They seem to be gone before you know it. They are 3.2 oz and applesauce cups are 4 oz. My kids never take the cups though, because they don't want to hassle with the spoon and mess. The only thing I would warn people about with these is that everyone I've seen try them baulks a little at first--maybe it's the getting used to drinking your applesauce thing. Kids and adults, both seem to need to give it another try after first thinking they don't really like it. Now my kids love it and I find myself grabbing them frequently too.<br /><br />Should you buy the 48-pack if you've never tried it? I asked myself if I could handle eating them all myself if the kids wouldn't (my answer was yes), so I think that's a good way to decide. You could also always donate them, although they're a little pricey for that. I think you should start with the appleapple first if you've never tried any (assuming you and your kids do like applesauce).

review/summary: Interesting flavor, multiple uses
review/text: Just had the kids try this flavor they loved it as much as the apple.  Will buy again.<br /><br />Below is my original review for the plain apple GoGo Squeez to finish this review.<br />When these got big and hit the shelves, my 2 girls had both grown out of baby food so I didn't notice these. Not until my father had handed it to my hungry daughters one day. It came out of no where so I had no idea why a grown man would have what I thought was baby food in his car. You see he had got a sample in a food market one day so he had the sample handy in his car one day when his sugar levels dropped. Being diabetic he needed something fast. He liked the convenience of these so much he now keeps them handy all the time. My father is a boss to a lot of people and I worry that with the hours he must spend managing so many people, it is a struggle for him to balance ones blood sugar level right once work projects reach their 11th hour. When he had first figured out he was diabetic, he would occational need to go to the ER because he could get it under control. Usualy due to working too much combined with not eating enough. So these things don't just keep the grandkids happy, but help keep him out of the hospital. For people as busy as my father with diabetes, products as convenet like these are true life savers.

review/text: Fromm is outstanding quality food.  You know how when starting a dog on a new type of food you need to wean them into the new food by giving a little bit at first and then more and more?  Fromm is such great quality that it doesn't have a "transition time". I have a dog with a very sensitive stomach, and I can tell the quality of a food by whether he will get GI issues after first eating it.  He can eat Fromm with no problems at all.

They like it better than the gold labeled grill with chunks in it.When they are presented with this dish for a meal there is no whining or looking around for the "better stuff," just the sound of kitties eating with no complaint, including stealing from each other's bowls, smacking sounds which are disallowed when human's are happy with a particular food, and the always famous...quiet dribbing of kitty food to the water bowl so that you will feel the necessity of changing the grunged up water bowl later: sounds/sights cat lovers all long to hear and see!!!

review/summary: A Delicious Classic
review/text: When I was a kid, I used to always buy these lollipops at the local market because they were DELICIOUS.  After I placed the order, I received the lollipops in two business days, I couldn't BELIEVE IT.  The first thing I did was pop a cherry lollipop in my mouth and it was the EXACT same taste I remember as a child.  Cherry is my FAVORITE flavor and there were a myriad of cherry lollipops in the box I received.  The other flavors in the box are Grape, Blue Raspberry, Orange, Watermelon and Strawberry.  Out of the 100 lollipops in the box, the two MAIN flavors were Cherry and Grape.  There were more than a few of the Blue Raspberry and the Orange but just about one or two of the Strawberry and Watermelon flavors.  I ABSOLUTELY HATE Strawberry and Watermelon so I was MORE than happy that they did not take over the box of lollipops.  If you LOVE a good lollipop with a lot of flavor, THESE are the ones to buy.  They are EXTREMELY difficult to find in stores and this was an excellent price.

review/summary: Memories of High School
review/text: Yep.  They are just as I too remember from High School 40 years ago.  Cherry and grape always have been my favorites.  There are quite a few orange, strawberry and blue raspberry.  I knew I would be happy with the suckers.  They have not changed and I never stopped liking them.  The challenge is finding them.  I should have known Amazon would point me in the right direction.  I read all the reviews before I ordered. Amazon did everything they could to protect the product.  The box of suckers was surrounded on all sides by those wonderful air pillows.  I was hopeful that there would be no breakage.  But, Amazon cannot stop the lollipops inside the manufacturer's package from crashing into each during the toss and tumble of shipping.  I counted (yes, I did) 14 shattered suckers.  I'll eat those because broken ones have no calories.  Many of the others show a few signs of being a little scuffed.  I'll still give them to friends and coworkers.  I also ordered the sweet and sour combination package.  I can hardly wait.  Close your eyes and enjoy the flavors.

They are hard to find in the stores so when I found them on Amazon I jumped at the chance.  They do have a lot of Cherry but I like all the flavors so I don't have a problem with that.  Maybe that is the most popular flavor so there are more of them in the box.  The pops last a long time so the sweet craving is gone before I have finished.  I do miss the polka dot colored wrappers from my childhood but I can get over that.  Over all a good choice when you are watching your calories.

review/summary: great tasting sugarless gum
review/text: Trident White peppermint sugarless chewing gum is delicious. I always keep a pack in the glove compartment of my car. I also carry the gum in my pocket so I can pop a piece in my mouth to freshen my breath just before social occasions--and even just before a dental visit!<br /><br />The gum is sweetened with sorbitol and aspartame instead of sugar; the absence of sugar is better for your teeth. The sorbitol and aspartame substitutes for sugar may make this a good chewing gum for diabetics; but please double check that with your doctor if you have any concerns about that. A piece of gum has no sodium and only five calories. It is very low in carbohydrates, too. It even comes with a freshness expiration date stamped onto the reverse of the package! Great! It does contain phenylalanine; if that is a concern for you then I would not recommend this product. It does not appear to be kosher, either, just in case that is important to you.<br /><br />In addition, each 12 piece gum pack is very slender; and this makes it very easy to carry it with you in a pocket or a ladies pocketbook.<br /><br />Overall, Trident White peppermint sugarless gum is a tasty, pleasant chewing gum.

review/text: I've not tried these from Amazon, but my local store occasionally carries the M&Ms almond. They are Terrific!  I don't care for peanuts, but these almond candies are absolutely wonderful.  And hey, they are protein too, so they are healthy for me!<br /><br />Just like the peanut M&Ms, these almond M&Ms have a whole nut covered in a layer of chocolate with a hard candy shell.  I find them most often at holidays (Wikipedia mentions Easter and Christmas) and they then come in appropriate colors.  Pastels in the spring, and greens and reds at the Christmas season.  Since an almond is a bigger nut than a peanut,  these are slightly bigger candies than the peanut ones.  They're not huge, just a bit bigger.<br /><br />And they are equally as addicting as is any other flavor of M&M!  (I recently tried dark chocolate M&Ms and loved them too.)

review/summary: Acquired taste, and proud of it
review/text: I am a soda fan, and I order unique sodas from all over the place. I just love to try the neat regional sodas that you just can't get anywhere but a limited area. Moxie fits that bill, as it might not be found in the local grocery. Having heard about America's longest continually produced soda from 1884 for many years, I finally determined to try one. They say it takes nerve to drink a Moxie. I learned you can throw all of your normal conceptions of soda out the window when it comes to the taste of Moxie.<br /><br />It has less carbonation than most sodas, so some people think it goes flat fast. It is just that is has less fizz to begin with, and that is OK since too much fizz actually masks the flavor in many sodas. It also has much less sugar than most sodas, only 25 grams per 8 ounce serving rather than the 40 plus grams of most sodas. The flavor is spicey, as in pepper - not Dr Pepper but peppery. It has a strong hot bite to it that some people say reminds them of medicine. It has a strong aftertaste. And that aftertaste stays with you for awhile, which is good if you like the flavor. I like Moxie better when I first taste it in my mouth as that is when the sweet part hits you, (it seems at first like Mr. Pibb) rather than a few seconds after I drink it until you get used to it. The taste is unusual enough that I hear New Englanders pride themselves on their ability to get used to the taste and like it. It is definitely an acquired taste. I myself noted that it tasted better the second day than the first, and the next day and so forth. Of course this is how we learn to like the taste of things like coffee. It is very dark like a cola, and it has caffeine. Today it is owned by Monarch in Atlanta, Georgia now. For another unusual but delicious regional soda at Amazon, try Cheerwine.

review/summary: Enjoying Moxie - a blast from the past... (1800s)
review/text: Just received my vintage bottles of Moxie - boy are they packed well! Yes, Moxie has a little less fizz and sugar taste than most sodas - that's fine with me. I do beg to differ with the review that says it has a hot (as in pepper) taste - to me it tastes very much like root beer with just a hint of the bitter gentian root that's in it.  It does give you a nice warm feeling inside after drinking it.  I highly recommend this "elixir." :)

review/summary: Organic, Vegan, Gluten Free Gravy!!!
review/text: With Amazon's Subscribe & Save option these are well below $1 per package!  I am able to make 1/2 of the packet if I don't need the whole thing.  Just mix it with water in the pan and whisk while it comes to the boil and simmer for only one minute and I had tasty vegan gravy!  It was perfect on my Edward & Sons organic, vegan, gluten free Instant mashed potatoes!  What could be easier or better?<br /><br />They also have a good looking recipe on the back of the packet for a lentil loaf that I plan on trying.<br /><br />Now I can't wait to try Roads End Organic's Savory Herb and Shiitake Mushroom varieties!

review/summary: Convenient & Tasty
review/text: I subscribe to the Road's End gravy packets because they are a great way to make a satisfying backpacking or camping meal - I can sautee up some fresh or re-hydrated veggies, add some gravy and eat them on top of instant mashed potatoes for a rich, filling meal.  The flavor is great & you don't have to use the whole pack - just roll down the top and save some for later.<br /><br />These gravy packets also make an excellent binder, to replace the UBI (you know - Campbell's cream of mushroom) in dishes like broccoli rice casserole (throw in a little Daiya cheese!).

review/text: Very tasty gravy.  Other products have confusing ingredients that may or may not be vegan or natural.  Why question, this is awesome and says Vegan right on the package.  My non vegan friends love it too.  It is very flavorful and quick to make with an amazing texture.  I have tried other vegan brands that turn out to runny.

review/summary: Good gravy - mild taste
review/text: I enjoyed and plan to buy more of this product.  So far I've only tried the savory herb.  Cooking it is simple and it thickens to a perfect consistency.  For me the flavor is too subtle so I have to use it along with other seasonings plus olive oil and yeast flakes.  Leftover gravy turns watery but is still useable depending on what you are putting it on.

review/summary: Will Not Buy It Again
review/text: The fact that it is organic is why I purchased it. The taste is somewhat bland, but the real kicker is that it is LOADED with commercial salt....not sea salt mind you.<br /><br />One serving (there are 4 per package) has 230mg! I don't eat that much commercial, overly processed, white table salt in a month! In fact, I get my Himalayan pink crystal salt from Amazon....and this stuff not only tastes great, it is a wonderful food for the body.<br /><br />Serves me right for not checking closer into the ingredients.

review/text: It is great to have this available as it is gluten free. The taste is okay to good. It does have a taste that I characterize as the taste I expect from a packaged sauce mix. I don't use it as much as I would like to as I can make a better tasting, more satisfying sauce, IF I want to take the time and expend the effort. I don;t always want to take time/effort, so on those times I use these mixes.

review/summary: An all-time favorite.
review/text: I grew up in a family of tea drinkers; and although I now tend to have a lot of coffee while I'm at work, I still drink almost exclusively tea when I'm at home. I generally prefer loose leaf teas - that way I know I'll get "the real thing," whereas tea bags tend to contain merely the leftovers of a harvest; little crumbs too poor in aromatic and other content to otherwise pass quality control standards.<br /><br />The exception are Bigelow teas: and first and foremost among those their flagship, Ruth Bigelow's original "Constant Comment" with its recipe of black tea, orange grind and holiday spices (primarily cinnamon). Created by Mrs. Bigelow on the basis of an old colonial recipe over half a century ago, the blend soon became so popular among her friends that their "constant comments" of approval prompted Ruth and husband David Bigelow to found their own tea company. Since then, "Constant Comment" has long become a true classic ... and if you love tea, it is indeed the perfect refreshment; whether or not it's Christmas time. (E.g., it also makes for great iced tea in summer; particularly if you add a bit of lemon.)<br /><br />If you're making more than a single cup of tea, and unless you like your tea *very* weak, you may want to rethink the company's measuring directions - based on the the "one bag per cup" ratio, you'll likely need two or more bags for an entire pot (depending on size), even when steeping an extra minute or two. That said, though ... wanna come over for a cuppa?

If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.
