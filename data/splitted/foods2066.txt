review/summary: Mallo Cups the best!
review/text: I have always LOVED Mallo Cups.  I grew up in Pennsylvania where they could always be had.  I have lived on the West coast now for nearly 25 years.  Whenever I get home to PA for a visit I make sure and buy some of these yummy treats.  They are definitely worth it.  Now that they are on line I will have to buy some.  YUM!

review/summary: Very low quality- and I'm not hard to please
review/text: So let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE fan of anything with marshmallows and/or mallow product of any kind. My boyfriend and I saw these and thought they sounded delicious, and they turned out to be a huge disappointment. The quality of the chocolate is terrible, I'm talking "Russel Stover" terrible: grainy, chalky, and hard. The "mallo" filling isn't too bad, but there isn't much of it, and the coconut is essentially non-existent. What you basically end up with is a mouth full of grainy, terrible chocolate flavor with sweet milky aftertaste from the wannabe marshmallow filling.<br /><br />If these things were more like Reeses Peanut Butter Cups with filling similar to the marshmallow in either Rocky Road candy bars or Hagen Dazz Rocky Road ice cream they would be awesome. And they should either have more coconut or none at all, because right now it only adds to the grainy texture without adding any flavor.<br /><br />Anyway, I seriously regret buying these- ESPECIALLY SINCE I LATER FOUND HUGE PACKS OF THEM AT THE DOLLAR TREE! -_-

review/summary: Mallo Cups
review/text: I hadn't eaten a Mallo Cup in decades and thoroughly enjoyed experiencing the taste and some memories of my childhood.  Although the cups that I received tasted good they were apparently seconds.  The filling in virtually every cup had partially leaked out of them.  I don't remember that in the ones that I had in the past.

review/summary: Somewhat unpleasant
review/text: When I first opened the can, it smelled musty.  Pu-er is supposed to be still actively aging, so I figured it must be normal.  (I haven't tried any of the cake pu-er yet.) It was very dark, and you could re-infuse it over and over, but the taste had a particular sour tang that even after several tries I still couldn't stand.  I tried airing it a few days to see if it just needed to let a bit of the mustiness out, but it didn't help.<br /><br />It could just be I don't like this tea, or maybe I didn't get a better batch.  Other Tao of Tea products have been quite good.

review/summary: Great taste, extremely convenient, good size serving
review/text: I purchased this item first at my local Giant just to try, it was a bit pricey at $3.50/each.  I tried it and I was immediately hooked.  I do really like tuna and the tuna found in this product is very good, the pieces are firm and not all mashed up and turned into paste.  After finding out that Sam's Club doesn't carry this I looked it up on Amazon.com and found it for $2.50/each so I bought several packs.  I am a university student and my eating habits are especially bad. I often skip breakfast and don't eat a lunch until after 4 pm.  Since a microwave is not readily accessible to me the fact that this tastes GREAT without heating is a huge plus.  I am an extremely picky eater and I found this to be very tasty and convenient.  The fact that this item is vacuum sealed and does not contain any preservatives is also a plus.  The included spork is quite sturdy and it is individually wrapped and there is also a sachet of "Orange & Acacia Honey" that is included which I don't think is mentioned in the product description.  With this I can pack one of these to eat around lunch time and I no longer have to starve for half the day.

review/text: I found this product to be extremely convenient to use since it does not require refrigeration or cooking and it comes with utensils.  The taste is a bit bland but not that bad.  It may also seem a bit greasy due to the olive oil but I wouldn't see that as a bad thing.<br />My advice is to try the wild salmon or the couscous version instead.

review/text: I'm not sure what the 1-star reviewer was expecting for $2.50 a can, but I found this to be tasty and convenient.  It can use a bit of salt, pepper or tabasco sauce, but to call it inedible seems hyperbole.  It's a healthy snack, and while it won't substitute for a restaurant lunch, does the trick for the office if you're not able to get out.

review/summary: Convenient and delicious! BUT, please be careful opening!
review/text: I've tried all of the varieties they have here and I really love them all, but I just had an accident with one of the containers that I want to warn others about.<br /><br />Please be very careful opening this can. Even though it's a foil top, it is VERY sharp and I got a nasty gash on my hand from it (don't even ask me how it happened, I have no clue! It caught me between my pointer finger and thumb somehow.) When opening, try to keep your hand away from the foil!<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant to try this because I am not very fond of fish. I do normally like tuna, if it's not that fishy, but then again I normally would eat it as tuna salad mixed with onions and mayo which would cut the fishy-ness somewhat.<br /><br />The tuna in this treat is AWESOME! It's nice big chunks of firm tuna that wasn't fishy to me at all! GREAT PRODUCT!!! I did, however, not get any dressing in mine, which I am disappointed about. I bet it would have even been better with that!<br /><br />I will order again, however! It was that good :) Just please watch out for your hands when opening. If you're a tuna fan to begin with, DEFINITELY give this a try...Yes, it is a bit oily (which is why I would have liked to have the honey dressing to cut that) but it's olive oil, so it's good for you! Go for it!

review/summary: Wow - Tasty, Conveniant & Cheap with Subscribe & Save
review/text: I was a little leery of a product that is A)canned meat & pasta. B)produced outside of U.S.A C)did I say CANNED?  I will tell you that I am very pleasantly surprised. I purchased this product because I am often eating granola bars in place of breakfast and lunch due to time constraints while working. This product works perfectly with that challenge. I can simply whip out a can of this, and eat. I don't have to get up to get a fork or heat it up. WOW!!!  The canned meal is exactly what the descriptions says it is. The texture of the food in the can is comparable to any type of soup that you might eat. The taste is a bit bland, but with a bit of black pepper or hot sauce you can change it up. I love it. And with a subscribe and save you get a nice discount so a per meal cost is around $2. PB&J can't beat that!

review/summary: Fishy Tasting and Smelling - Oily Taste
review/text: I purchased this as one of a group of items to test before buying for a trip. I chose this one because of the high protein content - 9 grams of protein per serving, or 18 grams for the complete can. Since it also has a relatively low carb count; it has 9 grams per serving with 3 fiber for a net carb count of 6 carbs per serving; it looked like a good choice.<br /><br />However, I did not enjoy this particular salad. The tuna tasted very "fishy" and the vegetables and pasta were very drab tasting. All I could really taste besides the tuna was the oil. Later, when I walked by the empty container in the trash I was overwhelmed by the fishy smell remaining. I can't imagine leaving the empty container in a car or in my trash can at work.<br /><br />It's OK, I would eat it if I were hungry, but it wouldn't be my first choice of meals. If you end up with this in a variety pack, I suggest heating it with cheese over the top, making a tuna casserole. A few crispy french fried onions on top of the cheese might really "spiff it up."<br /><br />Another thing to note is that the box says the container is "microwave safe." However there was an insert that said you should remove the contents from the container before placing in the microwave. Since the container is metal, I'd take the safe route and heat it in a microwave safe dish.<br /><br />An OK meal, but not great at room temperature on its own. I suggest if you want tuna for a trip to buy one of the packages with crackers, mayo, and pickles, cheaper and better tasting.

review/summary: Very convenient, tastes good, and the perfect portion
review/text: A friend of mine gave me one of these to try and I let it sit for a few weeks. One late night I was hungry so I decided to try this - I was pretty impressed. No it's not as good as making fresh hot food, but for coming out of a can, I think it's pretty good! An added bonus is that it's not loaded with sodium; one can has around 600mg of sodium which is not bad at all for well, coming out of a can.<br /><br />For the price (~$3/can) I think it's great. I love to cook so I rarely ever eat anything out of a can like this, and pretty much avoid any canned or packaged 'meal' because it's usually loaded with sodium and fat. Not this. I also tried the salmon with vegetables and honestly, I don't really care for it. This tuna one is much better. I see some people are complaining about the amount of tuna in these.. To me, the portion is acceptable for $3. You're PAYING for the convenience so it's probably not going to be chock full of tuna.<br /><br />I'm pretty pleased. I eat a lot but try to eat at least 4-5 meals and make them a little smaller, and I use this as my last late night meal before bed. Perfect portion. I probably would have appreciated this even more back in college when I stayed up late doing papers and what not. My advice: try this -- maybe buy a single can at a local market, but I'm pretty sure you'll like it!

By comparison this tuna and noodle tastes "off" tinny or something just not right with the taste. I took a few bites and took a break - then took a few more bites and disposed of most of the can.

I had to come back and double check to make certain they hadn't accidentally sent me a sample package.  Will not order this again...definitely not worth the $$.

review/summary: Disappointment
review/text: Although the dogs seemd to like them I was unimpressed. They appeared to look like dried pieces of wood and there were only 5 or 6 pieces in the bag. The product looked like pencil erasers. I only purchased this item as I needed to bring my total up to $25 to get free shipping on another product I ordered. Will not purchase again.

review/summary: A Nice Fruity Matcha!
review/text: I love pears--fresh, juicy, and crisp! This matcha captures the flavor of a perfectly ripe pear well, and it tastes pretty true to life. I think the matcha itself is really the star of the show, the grassy green tea flavor goes so well with fruit flavors, and pear is no exception! It reminds me of summer, warm days and cold fresh fruit and cut grass. A good, basic flavor, that will be great for blending with other types of matcha.

review/summary: Just May Be My Favorite So Far!
review/text: I think that the review I wrote for this somehow got lost somewhere in cyberspace, so I am writing another.  If the other one manages to find its way back, forgive me for having two reviews on the same tea!<br /><br />This is an awesome Matcha, if it isn't my favorite flavored Matcha thus far, then it is definitely my favorite pear tea thus far.  The pear flavor is very true to the fruit - authentic tasting and very strong.  It tastes so much like pear that I can almost feel the pulpy texture of the pear as I sip this!<br /><br />An excellent Matcha.  If you're wondering where to start with Matcha, I'd recommend this one.  So good.  So very, very good!  (Oh, the caramel one is good too!)

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: Coffee Crisps are Awesome.  I just found some the other day at a Wegmans (also awesome) in VA and had a little happy dance finding them.  Guy near me asked if they were that good and I of course said yes and explained how they were normally not available outside Canada. He picked one up and said he would give it a try.  I didn't add that growing up in Buffalo I remembered that whenever someone was crossing the border a bunch of people would give them money to pick up Coffee Crisps and they would bring back a bunch for everyone.  Anyway they are like a far better coffee-flavored version of Big Kat but with thinner chocolate. In short -- awesome. Enjoy!

review/text: Great candy bar!  Very light and guiltless.  I had a few of these once that someone brought from a vacation and kept one of the wrappers so that I could find them here in the US and I did here on Amazon however, I do feel they are overpriced.  A 10-pack for $40 that equates to $4 each plus tax/shipping which is too much for a candybar let's be honest.  I can't bring myself to order at this price but had to tell you that they are just wonderful.

review/text: I ordered these for a friend who is from Canada and these always were her favorite candy bar as a child.  She can never find them in the U.S. and I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  (Can't you just find everything on Amazon??).<br /><br />I was worried these might arrive stale or something, but no...they were just perfect.  And she said they were the original Coffee Crisp not some newfangled formula. Moreover they were packed well and arrived in perfect shape.<br /><br />I had to agree with her....these are a fantastic candy bar! They aren't too sweet, and are light and fluffy with a coffee flavor.  The bar has a coffee cream mixed on several layers of wafer cookie with a milk chocolate covering.  Yummy!!

I found suppliers out of the country, but all only sold betel leaves by bulk making any purchase pricey.  Finding Hawaiian Betel here was a relief.  Extra satisfying, I promptly received a nice package of leaves within a few days ordering through Amazon from BetelGardens.  "YourIndianShop" followed up with a "Thank You" letter asking if we were satisfied or if they could do anything ensure our satisfaction.  The Owner, Amrutha, also sent a 10% coupon for our next order.  This was fast, supportive and nicely priced service.

I like it so much I have it on auto order so I can have some to ice in the summer

I use the large chunks straight out of the bag as treats, and daily I give him a small amount of it mixed with warm (not hot) water.

review/text: I bought this food since it is very difficult to provide my cat with a variety of food due to all of her allergies. I was excited to find this food. Not only are the ingredients high in quality, but they are allergy free. The bad part is that my cat just won't eat it and she is not a fussy eater. The food is very dry (even when soaked in water), even the canned food is void of any gravy. This food may be better suited for dogs than cats. I'll have to wait for Natural Balance to straighten out the recall issues and rely on Wellness until then.

review/summary: Absolutely heavenly candy ... if you love gummies, then this is sure to please
review/text: This is the perfect combination of chewy/gummy combined with a "peppy" soft core.  It is really quite hard to explain; but just trust me, go buy one some day and you'll understand what I mean.<br /><br />My candy arrived promptly and securely (shrink-wrapped).  Absolutely nothing to complain about.<br /><br />As a note, if you tried a Kazoozle at one of the big chain movie theaters...do yourself a big favor and buy *these* "large" versions instead; they are soooo much better!  That is, the "8-pack" they sell you at the movie concession stand is really a rip-off in my opinion because the size of each stick is seriously only 1/3 the thickness/volume as one of these "full-size" Kazoozles that are sold at Amazon.  I point this out because the skinny "movie theater version" has little to no zippy core; instead the vast majority of the product is the red licorice exterior.  Don't get me wrong, the red exterior is great...it's just that the candy doesn't show it's true colors unless it is in the proper proportion as it is here at Amazon.<br /><br />Finally, the cost of the item here at Amazon is actually a better deal than what you would pay at a gas station or a supermarket (if you could even find them).  They are actually about 25%-40% cheaper when you buy in bulk at Amazon.<br /><br />And as a final point, I must say that these "Cherry Punch" versions are WAY better than the other flavor that has the crystal sugar on the outside of the licorice exterior.  Truly though, the other flavors of Kazoozles don't even hold a candle to Cherry Punch!

review/summary: The best candy ever
review/text: I consider myself a candy connoisseur, and so many times have I've had cravings for something sweet yet nothing in the stores seemed to hit the spot. Keep in mind, the one type of candy I cannot stand is licorice. One day, my boyfriend saw a movie with his dad and the theater had a deal- buy one popcorn and soda and get a Kazoozles free. He brought it back home for me and not knowing it was licorice I tried a piece. I've finally found the candy my cravings were calling for! I can safely say this is the PERFECT candy!  It's soft, chewy, slightly tangy and the core is filled with what tasted to me like blue blended sweetarts. What's even better is the package says "fat-free" although I honestly don't see how something this delicious can be fat free...but if that's not true, then this candy is worth breaking any diet. The only bad thing about it is it's really hard to find! I had been looking anytime I stopped in a store, and one day I had a craving for it so bad that I even dreamed about it! I tried googling where it can be bought and quickly discovered the best option is to buy it in bulk online. I didn't order it from Amazon, at first because I found another website that sold the other flavor (cherry lemonade). This candy is AWESOME! I wanted to tell Wonka that they need to make this candy as available in stores as any other candy they sell. Wonka deserves an epic praise for making a candy that hits the spot!

review/text: Five stars? Really? Who is writing these reviews? This candy is disgusting. The texture was off-putting to start and then the flavor, eeeyuuuckkk just sugar mixed with sugar mixed with even more sugar. Kinda fun to give to people though, as you watch them try to figure out what is happening.

review/summary: So that's why they call it Holy Basil!
review/text: I've been adding Tulsi Tea to my diet.  I love the peppermint flavor and drink it daily along with my other great teas.<br /><br />I didn't really care for the flavor of this honey chamomile tea.  I don't think it was the honey flavor that was bothersome- actually the Tulsi just seemed at odds with the chamomile.  It actually tastes a bit like basil, which I hadn't experienced with the peppermint, I guess because the tastes meshed so well together.  In this cup, I actually felt like I was drinking Basil-Chamomile tea.<br /><br />I can say I've never tasted the anise flavor that people find prevalent in Tulsi teas.

review/text: This one was eaten, but not happily.  They like salmon, but the greens thing in these florentines just don't tempt their appetites whatsoever.  They do look like real people food when you open the can, however. They don't smell up your kitchen like most cat food does and honestly, the nutritional content of these varieties makes all of them worth a try.  If you cat loves salmon, by all means try this one if nothing else, because of the nutritional value.  But if they're so-so, you may opt for a less expensive variety.  I do recommend these varieties very highly, however, because of their nutritional content, but we prefer the egg souffles in this house! :)

review/summary: High Quality from Hill's
review/text: We live in Santiago, Chile and the pickings were slim as far as quality dog-food is concerned. We had to search far and wide, and ended up having to import this food directly from the US. The monetary price for doing that is really high (about $80 USD per 35lb bag), but it really has been worth it. When our dog was around 7 months old we found him living on the streets (in developing countries, like Chile, millions of homeless dogs roam the streets and scavenge through trash to survive). He had cuts and scrapes all over his body, was very skinny, little energy, and his coat was a little patchy. Only months later our 1 year 3 month old black lab's muscle tone is great, his weight is staying at the ideal range without problems, he's healthy with a strong immune system, his coat is absolutely beautiful and shiny(even though we bathe him very frequently), and his energy levels are great (plenty of energy to play with us and with other dogs, but also calm enough to lie down and relax with us). I attribute a lot of his quick turn-around to him being able to eat this very high quality food. I'm very confident that it has given him a really stable nutritional foundation.

review/summary: Too Expensive for the Quality of Food
review/text: This food was not only super messy, but it made my dog itch like mad! The kibble is very dusy/grainy. You touch it and kibble fuzz gets all over your hands, it was always getting stuck on my dogs face when he would eat. It could be that my dog is just allergic to corn, but having owned dogs in the past any food that contained corn almost always made my other dogs feet itchy too. I am not going to rant on about high quality food vs. low quality food, but some of the SD Dog foods out there are way over priced for the ingredients that are in them. The only reason I was feeding this to my current dog is because we adopted him and the shelter gave us a free bag; so we used it to transition him to new food with no corn.

review/summary: fine sugarless gum with a peppermint burst
review/text: Trident White makes a terrific peppermint flavored sugarless gum. The sugar free gum is healthier for your teeth; and the gum makes your breath fresh in an instant. The thin cardboard package is easy to carry because it is so small; and inside the thin cardboard package the pieces of gum are wrapped individually in tiny plastic pockets that are easy to open. The package states that the gum whitens teeth but I cannot comment on that. Always remember to brush your teeth--this gum isn't a substitute for that!<br /><br />A single piece of gum has nothing more than a measly five calories; and there's no fat, no sodium and no sugar. Trident White uses sorbitol and aspartame to sweeten the gum. Moreover, the gum stays fresh until the expiration date stamped on the reverse of the package. Good job!<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a couple of caveats: The gum contains a milk derived ingredient and it contains phenylalanine. If either of these ingredients pose a concern for you please consult your doctor before chewing this gum.<br /><br />Have further questions? No problem--the manufacturers give you both a toll free number and a website. The website goes into detail about how this gum helps to whiten your teeth.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great gum that comes packaged in an easy to carry container. This gum makes your breath fresh; and it's a very tasty gum that you won't want to spit out after a mere five minutes.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: I purchased this package of 3, 16oz cans from Amazon.com. While the pancakes/waffles are definitely edible, they aren't my favorite. I followed the package instructions on the preparation required, added the ingredients (egg, milk, butter, and of course the mix), yet found that the strawberries did not taste as good as if you were to add them fresh, some were a little hard too (I did allow the batter to set for 10 minutes as the instructions state), and overall, the aroma of the strawberries went away after cooking and adding some syrup (not alot :P). I found that my pancake mix from Trader Joe's is better taste wise, fluffier, and less expensive. This recipe, unlike other pancake recipes, requires you to add butter or oil, and I was able to taste the butter more than the strawberries, not in a good way, more in a, I know this has a good amount of butter. Would I purchase this again, no.

review/summary: Firm tasty pasta
review/text: Last night, we went to dinner at an Italian restaurant in town. I had been assured that they could make me any dish on the menu with gluten-free pasta.<br /><br />When my dish came, the pasta was so different from what I was used to that I had my boyfriend take a bite to make sure it really tasted like gluten-free pasta. (It's been a very long time since I've had pasta with gluten.) After devouring my meal, I asked the waiter to find out what pasta the chef was using. It was this one.<br /><br />Here's what I liked about it: It was firm! It had retained it's structural integrity! All the penne pasta still looked like Penne pasta. And it tasted good.<br /><br />I am used to Schar and Bi-Aglut, both of which have an excellent taste. But even with the gentlest boiling, the noodles do seem to fall apart quite a bit. You will never, for example, end up with spaghetti strands long enough to "wind". Other GF pastas seem to turn to paste in the pot--or just taste like it.<br /><br />I thought I'd tried every GF pasta on the market. I was wrong. This pasta is OUTSTANDING. Please try it. You won't be disappointed.
