review/summary: Too hard to chew and expiring
review/text: I thought this one would be better than the blue potato that I tried 3 months ago as it has better review/rating, but it turned out to be a bad one. I am not sure if it became that hard to chew just because it is expiring in 1 month, but it hurt my teeth and jaw after finishing half of the first bag. My jaw became clicking sound and I had to see my doctor after eating this. I think three forth of the chips in each bag are those hard ones. Now, the remaining became the feeding food for the squirrels. Conclusion: 2 problems: (1) those 24 bags are expiring in one month; and (2) most of the chips are too hard to bite.

review/text: These tasted nice, but I think they are too thick and ridiculously crunchy. We purchased these to snack on at work, but they made too much noise to eat politely in a cubicle. Also, I have TMJ, and I sometimes found them difficult to eat. But if that's not a problem for you, they are a tasty, healthier alternative to potato chips.

review/summary: My new favorite Pringles
review/text: Move over Pringles Cheddar Cheese, I have a new love! For the longest time (since I was five), cheddar cheese was my ultimate favorite Pringles flavor but eversince I tried jalape&ntilde;o, I've been hooked. I can't get enough of them. I don't mind having it every single day. It has the right amount of flavor- at least for me. This one is not too hot which means I can have as much as I want (my stomach gets upset with spicy stuff, btw). It's spicy enough for me plus it's very flavorful so I'm hoping they would never change one bit of ingredient. For those people who like it really spicy, I don't think this would even excite your taste buds though. If you want something flavorful that's a little bit hot, I would definitely recommend Pringles Jalape&ntilde;o!

review/summary: An extremely unusual flavor--very long lasting
review/text: This is the best flavor of gum I have ever tried.  I wasn't even in the habit of chewing gum often, but this gum is making me into a habitual gum chewer.  I like it so much!  One thing that you should know about this flavor is that not everyone likes it.  Several of my family members don't like it much at all.  However, I think the flavor is amazing, and quake at the thought that they might discontinue it some day.  What would I do?  There's nothing even similar.  This gum freshens your breath, but it isn't as harsh as some of the other Eclipse minty flavors.  It's mildly spicy, but not quite as strong as most cinnamon gums, I would say.  It does have a pleasant sweet spicy flavor that lasts and lasts.  In fact, one odd (but in my mind, wonderful) thing about this flavor is that it actually gets stronger as you chew it longer!  I don't know how they did that.  It contains cardamom (a spice used in gingerbread and also in Indian curries).<br /><br />Please try it!  I'm desperate for you to try it and like it.  We've got to get more people buying this gum so that the flavor is never discontinued.

review/summary: Really Good Chewing Gum - Highly Recommended!
review/text: Eclipse Breeze Exotic Mint chewing gum is, by far, the best breath freshening sugar free gum I have tried. Unlike other gums where you need multiple pieces to get any noticeable effects, one piece of this gum is enough to leave your mouth feeling cool and clean. The cardamom flavor is fairly strong, so that might make a difference to how much you like this gum (my parents used cardamom a lot, so I like the taste).<br /><br />My only minor complaint is that the gum becomes somewhat "stringy" after chewing it for a long time, and since the flavor really does last a long time, it almost always happens.<br /><br />This is a really good, long lasting gum!<br /><br />Highly Recommended<br /><br />CFH

Just to be sure that it wasn't only me, my kids tried it as well and they both found it to be "gross".<br /><br />The only real upside of this sugarfree gum is that after the berry flavor goes away, the cardamom does do a good job freshening your breath.<br /><br />Not Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

The flavor is just right and it lasts forever.<br /><br />Seriously, if you see this gum in a store, buy all of it. It's like little candy gold bullion. I have opted to pay twice as much online for this gum versus gum I can buy on the store shelves just so I can get this particular flavor. Who would do that if the gum weren't the best gum ever? Nobody. That's who.<br /><br />I also wrote Wrigley to see if they'll send me a year-supply for free. Cross your fingers and wish me luck.

The cardamom works very well with the mild mint flavor, but "berry cardamom" sounds like a terrible idea. No thank you!

review/text: NALLEY CHILE CON CARNE REVIEW on AMAZON.COM<br /><br />As a child, I was brought up eating this FABULOUS tasting brand of Chili Con Carne. The "ORIGINAL" flavor is still the best, in my opinion. There is NO better brand of Chili Con Carne, than "NALLEY", that I have been able to find and I've tried pretty much everyone available. Try it on two (2) pieces of toasted, 100% whole wheat bread...heavily buttered OR using Imperial Margarine non-hydrogenated choice. Then, cut it into NINE (9) pieces for each one of two (2) pieces of toast...to make it last longer. Mmmmmm!!!  You'll be even more pleased that you have read this little so called review, if you try this suggestion, along with the more important suggestion found below.<br /><br />One person can make the contents of a (40) oz can, last for four (4) meal servings, if one is concerned about the HIGH salt or sodium content and/or the weight gain from too many calories.  Ten (10) oz on two (2) pieces of toast is more than enough. This is also a GREAT source of protein, in ones diet.<br /><br />Did you know that a high protein diet, from BEEF or any other RED meat source, is the MAIN cause of cancer cell overgrowth in human body tissues??? Something we call "CANCER" and keep wondering why the horrible and extremely sad true stories are becoming more and more difficult to listen to and worse to experience...which we have unfortunately experienced in our family...too many times over and over. Just to mention a few, a Mother-in Law, a Sister-in-law, several aunts and uncles, a few friends and then, the very worst of all, my very dear darling wifey, at age (57) years young. There wasn't anything that I have been taught and learned over the years and years that could save any of the above...you see, they would NOT listen to the "RED MEAT PROTEIN FACTS", that I've taken the time to try to help you with...above. Am I listening myself? It's NOT 100% yet but I am almost there but a ways to go myself. :o) I tell you that to be honest and try to show you that I am NOT trying to condemn anyone but ONLY to help the ones that will heed the above and hopefully ONLY die of an old age but a healthy old age full of everything we all could have if we only would listen and in some cases, even knew more of what we are doing that is making us ill and causing premature death. :o)<br /><br />This is the VERY BEST reason, I can think of, why we should eat more things like the kidney bean source of protein found in this extremely fine product call Nalley Original Chili Con Carne with Beans. :o)  Unless one is allergic to legumes or the beans found in this product, or some other GOOD reason, may I please suggest than no one wastes their time eating "CHILI" without the beans. '<br /><br />ENJOY...

review/summary: quite tasty!
review/text: there are a variety of ginseng coffee packets out in the market, and basically they all taste quite good.  the difference between gold choice and other brands, is gold choice lists instant coffee and ginseng as the first two ingredients and sugar last.  the other brands list sugar first, coffee creamer, coffee and ginseng last.  you do get a good energy boost from these coffees, but i've always wondered how much of it is from the ginseng or the sugar.  i will stick with this gold choice brand ginseng coffee for all future refills.

review/summary: Dessert in a cup
review/text: We first tasted ginseng coffee on a vacation in Italy last year. Unable to find it in stores where we live, it finally dawned on me to check on Amazon. Gold Choice looked like a good choice, so I ordered three lbs as a Christmas<br />gift for my husband. It arrived on time, and this instant coffee product tastes exactly as we remembered. Full bodied, rich flavor and aroma make it an absolutely delicious special treat. Good mail order service. We'll be ordering here again very soon. Highly recommended.

review/text: The kidney beans and black beans by Libby seem more like home canned than some of the others, which makes them taste better....like the black beans most of the cans had quite a bit of juice...a few more beans could give this a 5 star!<br /><br />This shipment came through o.k. and was thankful they also were stamped product of USA.<br />I ordered two more cases and there were several cans damaged in that shipment.  One the lids had swelled and I do not think it will be safe to use. Maybe Amazaon resolves this issue, I've not had much experience in that line.

review/summary: Food for Thought Fruit & Nut Bar: Eat Me...
review/text: NOTE from the Package: Official Instructions for Bar Consumption by the King of Hearts<br />"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: THEN STOP!"<br /><br />This is a fun little novelty item for Alice in Wonderland fans. The outside of the package contains quotes, riddles, brainteasers, and trivia related to the classic story. The bar code on the bottom seems to suggest a "Cheshire Cat" smile, which is a clever marketing touch. Inside of the package, a tasty Fruit & Nut Energy bar can be found. The"Food for Thought" Energy bar, with hearty bits, has a full, rich flavor. It's hard to describe, but it something akin to a fruit cake or granola texture. It's rather sweet and chewy, but in a satisfying way.<br /><br />I give four stars because I wanted a bigger bar or other feature for the price. (It's a novelty item though, so this is probably why the price.:) However, I would buy it again with no worries as a special treat because I did like the taste, and you have to laugh at a food that boldly demands: "Eat me!" LOL So, I'm hoping that this product will be available for a long time!<br /><br />Safety Recommendation: people who have special diets, dietary limitations, or food allergies should carefully check the current ingredients list and contents before purchasing / consuming. You can contact The Unemployed Philosophers Guild for more information and / or check out their website.

review/text: Not for the faint of heart, but this is the best pumpernickel bread I have had. It pan fries nicely in butter and becomes sweet if you do it properly, but can also toast quite well on its own. Very fibrous and wholesome; nothing like typical wheat bread and should not be expected to be as such.<br /><br />Sometimes a bit cracked, but pumpernickel is not expected to be strong and pliable. It'll break on you when you eat it; just part of the process. A very good deal on the whole, certainly the best price I've found.

Very nice with something on it, plain, or toasted. Made in Germany.

The first ingredient on other rye breads is wheat flour. This rye bread only uses whole kernel rye and rye flour.So it does have a stronger taste, nutty and rich. I am so sold on this product.

review/summary: Wonderful Dog Food
review/text: A recently deceased friend told me about this food, Canadae Platinum.  He fed his "boys" both the dry and the canned.  His boys are a German Spitz and a Bichon Frise, 4/14 years old respectively.  Doug said that after less than two weeks, the 14 year old was like a "new dog".<br /><br />I now have his dogs, fullfilling a promise, added to our Doxy and Shiba Inu ( 5/7 years respectively), three cats and 7 birds.  All the dogs are now on this Canadae Platinum dry food and love it.  While they used to pick at their old food, they dive into this.  They also seem to get satiated faster, so they actually leave a little in the bowls.<br /><br />The Glucosamine/Chondroitin is the key for the older dog.  A vet once recommended it for an older dog we used to have years ago.  When I started taking it for my arthritic ankles, I was soon able to stop taking anti-inflamatories like Daypro.  I've since found out that the medical establishment considers GC to be useless.  All I can say is that it works for me, and within a few weeks of re-starting Little Boy ( the 14 year old) on this food with GC, he runs, plays and jumps with the rest of the dogs like a puppy.<br /><br />There are a few places in Las Vegas selling this food, all "high-end" pet food stores and all slightly more expensive.  The convenience of one-click and having the food on my doorstep in a day or two is even better than the savings.<br /><br />We've also moved our cats over to Felidae (the feline version of Canadae) with similar results.

Check out the ingredients and you'll see there are no Corn products which, while being rich in protein and carbs, is also pretty fatty and is much cheaper to use.  I think you'll be pleased with your results with this food.

review/summary: Long live longevity!
review/text: I've been feeding my dogs Canidae foods for over 10 years.  I partially attribute their longevity to a great diet and regular exercise.  I had some problems in the past when it appeared that Canidae reformulated this particular food and I ended up switching to another brand.  I was never happy with the other brand, and after about a year off from Canidae, I gave them another try.  The food was back to the former formula and my dogs loved it (and still do).  I'm happy that this senior formula has Glucosamine as a supplement.  Overall, aside from the reformulation issue, I'm a happy Canidae customer and my dogs are happy Canidae dogs!

review/text: I have a 8 year old overweight Bichon Frise... he's a full 28 lbs! I just started him on this food about 2 weeks ago, and I already see a difference. People have commented that he has lost weight and I notice increased energy.  I also notice that he is not as hungry as he normally is.  So far, so good with this food. And, super convienent that it is dropped off at your front door!

review/summary: My dog looks amazing!
review/text: Because of the price, I decided to only feed this to my oldest (and only overweight) dog (out of 3 dogs).  She looks so good and still has a lot of youth and energy.  I adopted all of them, but I believe she is about 11.  I haven't weighed her, but she has visibly lost weight after 2/3 of the bag!  I'm guessing she has gone from 90 to 85 pounds in about 3 weeks, which is incredible.  I read a lot of good things online about the ingredients of this and a few other premium foods.  We will certainly continue with this if we can afford it; it's actually a great value if you have Prime; which is worth it if you're going to be ordering heavy items such as this.

review/summary: LadyBug Likes it
review/text: Ok, to be fair LadyBug likes anything edible.  :)  Which was part of the problem....  Lady is a older (11-14 yr.) std. American Eskimo who loves to  eat that I inherited from my Grandmother.  She got up to 42 lbs on her previous diet dog food and the vet wants her to be 35.  That means she was overweight by 20%  &lt;cringe>.  So I discovered this food and after &lt;6 months, she is 36 lbs.  She likes the food and once she adjusted to the smaller quantity of food, found it to be quite filling.  Our Bear (6 yr. Great Pyrenees / Border Collie mix) sometimes steals Lady's food instead of eating her own.  I'll probably move Bear over to this dog food next year.  I should probably note that as old as Lady is, she acts like a young dog...  even though she is losing her sight slowly.

review/summary: Best Mild Curry.....easy to use, store, pleasing to all
review/text: Yummy, yummy!<br />This curry paste is now my favorite. It is easy to use, store, and best of all it is delicious! Pataks Curry is very mild....not super spicy like many others. My husband likes flavor and a little spice so this is his favorite as well. I can use the one jar for about 4 meals which is a great deal.<br /><br />I have found that is it so simple to make a "stir-fry" with a protein like tofu, chicken or even salmon and then add veggies such as carrots, or potatoes. There are many combinations and just about any typical veggie taste great in this sauce (love cauliflower). I think it is best kept simple with 2 or 3 ingredients.<br /><br />This sauce is great for an easy meal with guests, throw the rice in the steamer, make the curry stir-fry, and add another side dish and you are set. Our friends love it!<br /><br />Pataks also makes other great sauces but this is my favorite to keep on hand at all times.

I know he enjoys the visual appeal of the coarse ground salt and I was tired of buying the $2.99 use-and-toss grinders of salt at the grocery store.<br /><br />As far as this salt goes, you should NOT use it in a grinder because it is too moist.  I did not know this until after I had purchased it.  I still use it as a finishing salt, but for the use I had in mind, grinding on food, it does not work.

review/summary: Good tea, but won't buy again
review/text: I wanted to try new flavors, so here is my experience:<br />1. Lemon Lift - lemon taste is too weak and i don't care for the spices they've added. I wish it had more of "clear" taste of lemons.<br />2. Green Tea - not bad for decaffeinated, but you have to love the taste of green tea to fully enjoy it.<br />3. Constant Comment - i wanted to love it but... sorry... it's not for my liking. The orange flavor is very nice but the spices are odd, almost smoky and salty tasting?<br />4. Earl Grey - excellent as usual. My first "Bigelow love".<br />5. French Vanilla - was the main reason for buying this assortment. Excellent flavor! Sweet and strong aroma, very satisfying tea.<br />6. English Teatime - nice, bold. Good as far as plain black tea goes.<br /><br />Conclusion - next time I won't buy this set, but only Earl Grey and the French Vanilla separately.

Can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />I will say though...if your dog is a gulper, please make sure you watch them while they eat/chew.

His teeth were extremely dirty with what seemed like plaque or whatever it was on his teeth that I could not get rid of by brushing his teeth.  I thought I would need the vet to professionally clean his teeth.  I was amazed as to how his teeth became pearly white after a few of these greenies not to mention that his breath did not have a nasty smell either.  I give these to my 2 year old pup as well.  Her teeth have never been as dirty as my 8 year old's but at least her breath is fresher too.<br /><br />5 STARS ALL THE WAY!

review/text: My dogs don't have terribly stinky breath and I have Greenies to thank for it. I've tried the knock-off products and to be honest they don't seem as well made, plus  my dogs actually seem less excited about them.<br /><br />I ended up buying the large Greenies (pkg of 8) for two reasons. One, the price-point seemed right and two, I have two dogs (60+ lb catahoula leopard dog and a 10 lb terrier mix) and its easy to break the large Greenie into two portions for them. One packages last us about 1 month (1-2 Greenies / week).<br /><br />Our dogs really do love these things. If we present them with the option of a Greenie versus some other treat (say a bone) they invariably take the Greenie.

review/summary: deadly
review/text: 1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous and Deadly, May 25, 2006<br /><br />I have two beagles who love to chew, and greenies are highly compressed which woule make it a good optionfor my dogs. However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse.<br /><br />If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a "busy ball". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy balls let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety.<br /><br />If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie.<br /><br />Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly.<br /><br />While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies.<br /><br />I am actually surprised amazon even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to amazon users to petition them to stop selling it.

I will totally buy these again - beats standing in line at the grocery store!
