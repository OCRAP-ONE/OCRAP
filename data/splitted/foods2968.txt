review/text: Bonnie's Tasty Herb Rub instantly turns chicken into a masterpiece.  I agree with the first reviewer:  My favorite way to use this rub is to put chicken breast or thighs in a gallon zip lock, with a couple of tablespoons of the rub, the juice from a lemon, I also throw in the peel, some salt and pepper and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  I pour all the contents of the bag into a pan and bake it and it comes out great.  Everyone in the family LOVES it and that is saying something.  Even if I'm just making some chicken on the stovetop for a quick meal, I just add some of this herb rub and it comes out great!  I gave some of my friends at work samples of the rub and got them hooked too.

review/summary: So simple, so heavenly!
review/text: I recently ordered some for myself and a friend.  I teach people how to eat in a health-promoting way, and I now recommend this to all of my students as a "no-brainer" way of preparing a great meal.  Open the can (ok, even the can is cool!) and your first sniff will tell you that you can use this rub for all kinds of things.  I love it on chicken (couldn't be easier to put some rub in with olive oil, garlic, lemon and let sit overnight before baking - yum!) but it is just as wonderful on roasted potatoes.  I have a lot of spices in my kitchen, but this is a quick, "go-to" combination that makes cooking up a great meal easy and fun.  An added benefit is how great the house smells when you are using it!

review/text: No, this is not sweeter than honey nor regular sugar nor even artificial sweetener.  However, it has the maple flavor that I need to add to certain winter cocktails (hot buttered rum, replacing some of the dark brown sugar with this) and to tea.  If you are expecting something super potent and super maple, like maple sugar candy, this ain't it.  It's what you'd expect from something that is pure and not artificially enhanced with other sugars or maple flavoring.  I'm satisfied and I think anyone would be IF they have proper expectations.

review/text: This is a great price for this.<br />I love baking with maple sugar, and sometimes I'll have it in my coffee as well. My favorite use of this wonderful tasting sugar is in shortbread made with whole wheat flour. The flavor stands up well to the stronger flavor of whole wheat and makes just the best shortbread I've ever had. I've also used it in breads. It's more expensive than brown sugar, but the maple taste of pure maple sugar can't be simulated.<br />It's also good in oatmeal, granola recipes, and most anywhere you would use regular sugar or brown sugar.

Yes, it is very expensive compared to regular sugar, even organic sugar, but anywhere else you will find it in the $20-$30 per pound range.  No, it is not a strong maple flavor, which I personally am glad about.  I can't afford to use it in all my baking, etc. but it is a nice treat for occassional use.  It is also much healthier than cane sugar in ANY form, including Sucanat.  I will continue to purchase it, although unfortunately not as often as I would like!!

review/text: I have a lot of food sensitivities that include cane sugar and high fructose corn syrup. I was using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009TMU0K">Pure Maple Sugar, 1 lb.</a> to sweeten the Roobois tea I drink, but the powder was a pain in the butt. It had a tendency to fly everywhere at the slightest movement because of how fine it is. I bought this 25-ounce container and I'm happy with everything but the high price (which is driven by market factors neither I nor the producer are in control of). Maple sugar is better tasting that cane sugar or HFCS, and it doesn't upset my stomach. The container is convenient compared to the bag the Barry Farms product shipped in. I also like the granules as opposed to the powder.

Broiling grapefruit halves?  Use maple sugar.  Baking (so much better than frying) bacon?  Sprinkle the bacon with a little hot pepper and maple syrup first.  You'll be hooked.  Oatmeal?  Of course.  I make an apple upside down pancake, swapping out the regular sugar with maple.  Amazing.  It's also great on yogurt.

review/text: Just tried this for the first time, and I'm quite pleased. We're planning to get some to take over when we visit friends in the UK - "live" syrup would be too risky to travel with - baggage handlers, airports, customs????<br /><br />I did find out some info by contacting Coombs directly - this is made from Grade A Dark Amber syrup; I would have preferred that they'd made it from the more flavorful Grade B, but "A Dark" will do in a pinch, and second, the woman at Coombs said it would re-constitute into syrup pretty well by adding 2/3 c. maple sugar to 1/3 c. water. Haven't tried as yet; suspect that 1/3 c. water may be a bit too much so I'll start with 1/4 when I try it.<br /><br />If reconstituting works out, it'll be great for any type of travel where weight and possibility of spills preclude taking real syrup along.

review/text: I had never tried maple sugar before, so I really can't compare it to another brand.  We thought that the taste was very good.  We like to sprinkle it on oatmeal.  It would certainly not be cost effective to use in baking.  At $16 or so a pound I cannot justify the cost. We really couldn't tell the difference between this and the $3/lb organic sucanat I found at the food coop.

review/summary: My Cats Really Enjoy This
review/text: My cats really enjoy this. Having grown spoiled and jaded on a diet of Fancy Feast, my cats did not know what to eat next. I was cruising through PetCo looking for an alternative when an employee came to my aide and suggested ProPlan. My kids like to have their meals in small bits, not in a thick lump like a Pate, and "Please Do Not Even Think About the dredded 'Shreds' ".<br />I took this and some other ProPlan flavors home for sampling. I was overwhelmed by the positive response!<br />Plates were licked clean very quickly. They continue to chow away on this flavor though it has been on their diet for a year! (It has just come to Amazon. I have been getting it from PetCo.)<br />All are quite healthy with shiny coats and clean teeth.(Kibble is free fed, while wet food is only for supper.)<br />I have been very pleased with this and the other Pro Plan flavors that come in bite sized chunks. I would suggest that you give Salmon and Rice to your kitties as a healthy meal and check out alternative taste treats under "Pro Plan Wet Food."<br /><br />My fondest hope is that Amazon will hurry up and put some of these flavors on "Subsribe and Save"! I have been hauling them home from PetCo for too long! This brand is great! Hope your kitties like it as well as mine do!

But peanuts were.  I ate lots of them.  Then my doc said cut it out. And told me about the health benefits of this little green bean.<br />I bought different versions, here at Amazon and else where.  All with salt.  I am supposed to cut down on salt.  So I finally ordered this package.<br /><br />Big surprise--they taste much BETTER without the salt.

review/summary: Fruit adds a wonderful dimension to green tea
review/text: I have to confess to being ambivalent about green tea. Normally, I drink herbal tea with no sweetener, or I occasionally drink a cup of black tea. But green tea, despite its health benefits, is not my favorite.<br /><br />However, add STRAWBERRY flavoring to green tea and you really have something. Strawberries add a light fruity acid to the tea and natural sweetness, so this takes away some of the tannic bitterness of green tea.<br /><br />Green tea has antioxidants, 1 cup of tea has the equivalent antioxidant properties of 2 apples. Strawberries have phenols --primarily anthocyanin, the colored components of fruits that also provide health benefits. But mainly, strawberries here add a great flavor.<br /><br />If you don't like green tea as a beverage, try fruit-scented tea like this one. It may change your mind. This tea is organic as well, so definitely it's worth your while.

However Diamond Naturals is highly rated and within my budget. I'm also not the type that spends time cooking or preparing food. I wanted a nutritious, healthy dry food with small kibbles for my small dogs that fit my budget. I am very satisfied with Diamond Naturals and my dogs seem satisfied too. The product arrived on my doorstep 2 days after I placed the order. Surprise!

review/text: The good thing about the Chipotle flavor is generally that the smoked jalapenos are a bit milder and more flavorful than regular (raw) jalapenos.  That is NOT the case with this powder.  This "Chili Chipotle Powder" is HOT HOT HOT, and seriously lacking in flavor.<br /><br />The other thing is that this is an extremely fine grind, so when I sprinkle it into a sauce, enough of it enters the air and I end up inhaling it, and it feels like I'm burning my nose.  YUCK!<br /><br />Stick with a plain old generic "chili powder" instead of this.

I use Allspice primarily for making carribean types of dishes like jerk chicken or pull apart jerk pork.  It also can add a really unique flavor component to gravies.  Although I don't do too many desserts, it's also good for spice cookies and I can imagine a cheesecake with a graham cracker + allspice crust being really good.  Another great quality spice from Frontier.

I was only going to have one, but one piece turned into two, two turned into three and I had to stop myself there before I devoured the entire package.

review/summary: Excellent quality white peppercorns
review/text: I was told years ago by many of the chefs at whose restaurants I dined in France and Italy that the quality of the spices in Europe is much higher because of the demand for the higher quality; as a result, we apparently do not receive the grade A spices in the US.  I was impressed by the quality of the spices at Hediard, Fauchon, etc...until recently.<br /><br />Many of those same chefs use either a large amount of, or exclusively, white pepper in their cooking, which was very surprising, as I had tried many sources, usually finding a fetid/fecal aroma in the background (sometimes the foreground!) of much of the product that I had purchased.  I commented on this to the previous head of Spice Hunter, who said that the problem is in production.  The least expensive method is the soak the peppercorns in ponds to remove the outer covering; the ponds become stagnant and the stagnant (read: fetid) aroma becomes part of the peppercorns.  The more expensive method is to soak the peppercorns in running water, which overcomes that problem.<br /><br />There is no comment about the production of this product, but I would be amazed if it were not the latter.  The aroma is so very exciting, with floral and spicy tones, and not a hint in the least of the off-putting aromas of other sources, even such well-known sources as Penzeys.  My wife and I are very delighted with this product.

I was extremely satisfied with these.  As to the cost, I have found that you pretty much get what you pay for.  Yes, the shipping is outrageous but it is outrageous for everything these days.  You can by a used .01 cent paper back book, and still end up paying almost four dollars.  The cost here is well worth the price.

The packaging is excellent, the delivery timeline is excellent, and the product is... well, I've already sung those praises above!  Oh, and a tip for you who order these, once the plastic bag is opened, just fill your pepper grinder(s), and put the remainder in a canning jar with a tight fitting lid, and store in a cool, dark place.  They stay fresh that way!!

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: The Bingo-Roo Kangaroo dog chew treats as stated are approximatly 10'-13'. I ordered two one for a distructive cattle dog (40lbs) and one for a shepard mix (75lbs)with severe allergies to beef. They both loved their kangaroo bones. Granted they were only allowed to have them for 15-30 minutes at a time they still made quite a bit of progress destroying the bones. In about 4 or 5 sessions (2-3hours)the bones are down to the center portion which is about 5'-6' in lenght.The shepard did get a slight up set stomach but it passed with in a day. The smell isnt too bad and the dogs love the taste but due to them being a little on the expensive side these will be added to the list of special order treats during the times I need the girls to be quiet for more than 20minutes.

review/summary: Tantalizingly Smoky, Delightfully Piquant
review/text: A good friend gave us this wonderful Whole Spice Chili Chipotle Powder for Christmas, 2009 and it's almost gone as I write this in early May, 2010.<br /><br />It's tantalizingly smoky and irresistable in the mysterious quality it lends to certain combinations. Yes, it's delighfully piquant and, if you have a heavy hand, just plain hot.  So, lighten up, use less and enjoy the deep flavor.<br /><br />Try a light sprinkle of this Chipotle and Garlic Garni on sunnyside-up eggs served on toast with a garnish of arugula or watercress.  Hmmmm...makes my mouth water just writing about it!

review/summary: Too spicy "flavor", too fine grind
review/text: The good thing about the Chipotle flavor is generally that the smoked jalapenos are a bit milder and more flavorful than regular (raw) jalapenos.  That is NOT the case with this powder.  This "Chili Chipotle Powder" is HOT HOT HOT, and seriously lacking in flavor.<br /><br />The other thing is that this is an extremely fine grind, so when I sprinkle it into a sauce, enough of it enters the air and I end up inhaling it, and it feels like I'm burning my nose.  YUCK!<br /><br />Stick with a plain old generic "chili powder" instead of this.

review/text: Diet Wild Cherry Pepsi is my favorite soda. Although I hate to admit this, I drink far more than I should--probably at least a twelve pack a week if not more. As my soda of choice, I find the diet Wild Cherry to taste less like a diet soda than any of the other sodas in the marketplace. There is a strong, but not too strong cherry taste. The flavors are much better than their closest competitor's brand! No comparison.

review/text: In my humble opinion, Haribo Peaches are dangerous. Don't eat them if you're celibate. Consuming these sweet-and-sour gummy peaches is almost an erotic experience. Being a sober-minded gentleman past my prime, I usually avoid them.<br /><br />Except as a guilty pleasure, of course!<br /><br />Eating them after devouring a Red Bull energy drink is especially sinful. Abstinence is a virtue, citizens of Alpha Prime. You have been warned.

review/summary: Highly Addictive, Strong Peach Flavor, Store Well
review/text: I've had my love affairs with Haribo candies on and off for years now.<br /><br />The peach flavor is probably my favorite. I preferred to buy these in the 5 pound size so they'd last over a year and I could share them, but the last time I looked, they only had the 5 ounce bags. I had a lot of trouble finding these for sale in the US, impossible where I am now.<br /><br />Be aware if you've never tried Haribo sugar-coated gummis that these are not like gummi bears, they're a step or two up from fruit slices in their gummi-ness :D<br /><br />I find the flavor of these to be almost natural, there is no artificial taste like I find in most candies and I'm very, very picky about that. The taste is very refreshing and peach-y.<br /><br />They also store well, as long as you keep them sealed. Once opened, store them in a ziploc bag or they'll get hard. Should be obvious, but I'm just saying :D<br /><br />A single bag of these will provide ME with about 3 servings. It depends on how much sweet you can take. I try to avoid overeating sugar and generally give away most of what I order just so I won't eat too much of it. You'll probably want to keep them all to yourself! :D

review/summary: Smell like feet when you sniff on it?......
review/text: I'm a big fan of haribo candies especially raspberries and gummy bears. I purchased these hoping I would enjoy the juicy+tangy taste of peach gummies. I mean, who can possibly hate the pleasant peach scent when they first open the bag? I couldn't resist but to toss one in my mouth. My first reaction: soft (not that chewy), fruity, doesn't taste artificial that much. As I was having few more, I started to smell something besides that aromatic peach scent. I questioned the origin of funky smell. I literally placed a peach gummy right on my palm and sniffed....... It smelled unpleasant, more like unwashed FEET. When you smell the bag as a whole, you can hardly notice it, but when you sniff on them individually, that's when it gets you. For people who commented here that they enjoyed these made in Germany, mine says it's from Spain. I'm not sure if that would make any difference though. I did try other peach ring kinds that are sold in local stores too, but they all seem to have the same issues.

review/summary: Not really gummy or peachy
review/text: I am so disappointed with these. First of all, they are coated in table sugar. I wasn't expecting that and it makes them taste drier than I'd like. Also they are really a firm chewy texture and require a lot of chewing, so they're not like other gummy candies I've eaten. Finally, although they smell like peach, they barely taste from peaches. It's mostly generic sugary flavor. The most positive thing I can say is that they are much better than Haribo Fruit Salad or Rainbow Frogs, which I also ordered. I'll be giving all of these bags of candy away and not buying Haribo again.

review/summary: This is the best!!!
review/text: I started eating this granola during a stent where I was eating foods without additives. I pretty much though I didn't like granola, but needed a snack and decided to give it a try. I originally bought it because it was the only granola I could find without any additives. Needless to say, I was AMAZED when I ate it! As other people have said, it is very fresh and the consistency is super, not hard, like most granolas. This makes the best yogurt parfaits. It's also good enough to just eat it alone, and you can't say that for the vast majority of granola. What's best about it though, is that it is actually healthy because all of the calories and nutritional content are from whole grains, nuts, and honey, not from other additional stuff whose only purpose I've found is to make the granola hard and not taste fresh. You will not go wrong buying this, trust me! My Fresh Market stopped selling their brand and I came on Amazon to see if I could buy it online and decided to write a review because I love it that much. It's that good.

review/text: If you are into Granola, and you haven't tried this, you really should give it a go!  Out of many granolas that i have tried, this is definitely my favorite.  Oats, Honey, Canola Oil, Almonds, Vanilla.  That's pretty simple!  It turns out it's not only simple -- it's pretty great tasting too, especially as executed by Udi's.<br /><br />I often eat this granola in plain yogurt or milk.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  The almonds are sliced thin, and add a nice contrast to the oats.  But my favorite part of this granola is the texture.  Hard, but not too crunchy.  The oats aren't 'chewy' like in some granolas.  perfect.<br /><br />I have nothing bad to say about this stuff.  I foresee more orders in my future!
