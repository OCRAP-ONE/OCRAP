review/summary: Ginger candy - yum!
review/text: I am a ginger fanatic and this is the best candy I have found. Soft, chewy, full of great ginger flavor and 'heat'! And the packaging is the best. With other brands I have tried, while they have been very flavorful, it was difficult to unwrap them without playing tug of war with the wrapping. These are wrapped in powdered parchment and then an outer wrapper, easy to remove and pop in your mouth. And the Amazon 5-pack price cannot be beat. I paid over twice this price in a local health food store. Stock up - they have a long shelf life!

review/summary: One of my favorite snacks
review/text: This is my favorite cheese.  It is particularly tasty when sharing each bite of cheese with a pretzel stick or two in the same mouthful.<br /><br />When I lived on the mainland, I would routinely buy Tiger Swiss Gruyere on almost every other grocery trip.  If you like high quality cheese, try to find this in your supermarket in the highly visible yellow round pack, with 6 foil-wrapped wedges.  The assorted flavors are also good, but I just prefer the plain variety.<br /><br />When I moved to Hawaii, I just couldn't find it in any local store. Bummer!  I now have to pay almost as much for shipping as the product itself. By mail order, it comes shrink-wrapped as 6 yellow round packs of 6 wedges each.  (You don't have to refrigerate it, and it tastes better at room temp.)<br /><br />My only complaint -- the mail order wedges are skinny 2/3 oz each, 4 oz per round, 24 oz per 6-round package.  The supermarket wedge is one oz each, 6 oz per round.  Watch out if you look at photos, since they incorrectly photograph the larger 6 oz rounds.<br /><br />I bought 2 packages (12 rounds) on Thanksgiving and ran out today. I just placed another order. Why would anyone pay $40 for 3 pounds of cheese? Because I can't find it any cheaper here, and save a LOT on shipping by buying two at a time.  If your supermarket carries it, it should be about half that -- you don't have to pay shipping you lucky dog!

review/summary: HEAT KILLS BENEFICIAL KOMBUCHA ORGANISMS!!!
review/text: I have always loved Yogi Teas and have many flavors in my cupboard as I write this. I have never tried the Green Tea Kombucha flavor and would normally not write a review on an untried product, but think it's important to set the record straight for anyone who purchases this product with the intent of gaining the benefits derived from kombucha. The beneficial bacteria, yeasts and enzymes that make kombucha so healthful can only do so if they are alive. Heat kills them, so pouring boiling water on a tea bag is going to obliterate those benefits. If you are drinking this tea for the taste or the other beneficial ingredients, then it probably doesn't matter to you. However, it is extremely disappointing that Yogi Teas is using deceptive marketing to influence consumers of their tea in this way. If you want to derive the therapeutic benefits of kombucha, it is necessary to either brew it yourself using a kombucha "mushroom" or buy the raw bottled version in the store.

review/summary: Original Idea---Kombucha from a Tea!
review/text: *****<br />This Organic Green Tea Kombucha from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Green Tea Kombucha is based on an ancient remedy and offers a convenient form of Kombucha designed for daily use. Legend has it that some 2,000 years ago, Kombucha originated in Russia, and from there it traveled to Japan. Since then it has been used to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach. This special healing formula is made with  Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis), which is organically grown and, unlike other green teas, has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. Green Tea has excellent antioxidant properties. To it we have added a concentrated purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm), which is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea, and is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs. The recipe is complemented with Organic Spearmint, which can help to relax the body and aid digestion; Organic Licorice Root, to support the adrenals and enhance the effects of other healing herbs; and Dong Quai Root, a well-known tonic. Once the benefits of these ingredients are released by hot water, you are ready to enjoy a delicious, delightful and soothing cup of tea - and one that is naturally rich in antioxidants and other health-supporting qualities."<br /><br />Yogi Tea's use of "Kombucha-Pure", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a decaf version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea is decaffeinated---naturally, of course!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: My digestive system thanks Kombucha :)
review/text: I began using this green tea shortly after the New Year when I was going to do a 3 day Detox that I had seen on The Today Show, which included drinking green tea 3 times each day. I chose this brand solely on the reviews since I was previously not a tea drinker and had no idea where to start. I was a little nervous about receiving 6 boxes of it the first time around, but am now actually getting ready to order another 6 boxes! On and off (more on than off) I have problems with constipation and it has been particularly worse since my entire pregnancy and birth in August 2010. I was increasing water, exercising, eating foods with fiber, even taking Colace and was still miserable. I tell you what, I have not had one problem with constipation since I started drinking this tea in January. Smooth as silk, for lack of a better description. It tells you on the box that it aids in immune and digestive function and so far it's claims are accurate. I haven't even been ill this winter (knock on wood). It tastes good, it smells great.... I have had many compliments on the smell of my drink while at work or others will come around and ask what smells so good. I even keep an extra few packets in my scrub jacket to share when people compliment it. I work nights, so the caffeine helps keep me energized. A neat addition to this product are the little sayings on each bag tag similar to the papers in a fortune cookie. Although I have not used any other green tea brands, I have to say that this is a great choice that I will continue to use for the simple fact that it keeps me regular and that, my friend, makes me happy :)  5 stars!

review/summary: Very good taste, great deal...
review/text: I am an avid tea enthusiast. I spend a good deal of time perusing little boutique shops and stores like Tea Gschwendner searching for that next great find. Though I tend to shy away from boxed teas, the Yogi line seems to be of rather good quality. When I saw a kombucha variety amongst their line-up, I just had to give it a shot. The tea is surprisingly good. I have a cup every morning. I am not too convinced that there is any real benefit from kombucha concealed amongst these little bags but there is a subtle hint of it in every cup. The blend is about as perfect as you can get, a bit fruity, a bit floral, a little vinegar, subtle. I steep for quite some time, usually 8-10 minutes to bring a bit more of that unique flavor only kombucha could impart. At 6 minutes, the flavors are more typical of a green tea / antioxidant or fruit blend but still very good.

review/summary: It's decent tea, just don't expect too much benefit from the Kombucha ~
review/text: If you really want true Kombucha health benefits you need to buy the bottled and refrigerated stuff.  Even cold brewing this tea (to not kill the beneficial bacteria), the tea is not made with a large amount of Kombucha.  I would say this is fruit flavored green tea WITH kombucha not green tea Kombucha as the label states.<br /><br />Overall though the tea has a pleasant taste, has organic green tea leaf, organic lemon grass, organic spearmint leaf, natural passion fruit flavor, natural plum flavor, and Kombucha-Pure extract.  But again, there is just a tiny amount of the Kombucha because apparently it's a pain to grow the fungi needed and that's why the bottled stuff is $2+ per bottle.<br /><br />But you can use as regular tea by hot water steeping (as per the instructions), or you can put in cool water (a couple of ounces) and leave in the fridge to steep for a couple of hours then add cold water up to 8-12 ounces total for a nice chilled beverage.  But don't be misled into thinking this will give you a lot of the probiotic goodies even brewed chilled.  And I do regularly purchase it for making iced green tea in the summer (see it says verified purchase).  So I'm still a fan!

Definately a worth a shot if your on the fence. Everybody I've given a sample to is hooked!

review/text: Yogi Green Tea Kombucha is by far the best tasting tea I have ever had the pleasure of consuming!  Knowing that Kombucha is a very sour/bubbly drink I expected a sour/bubbly tea, but this is NOT at all sour.  Some slight fizzing possibly but mostly a wonderfully pleasant, green tea with lemongrass flavor.  I couldn't/can't detect any Kombucha taste, but I certainly can feel the Kombucha difference.  I have more energy, less appetite and an overall happier feeling.  I drink it first thing in the morning, before lunch, dinner and before bed.  I love this tea.  I just LOVE this tea!  I've gone to auto delivery monthly for a pack of 6 because I am constantly drinking this and sharing this tea.  It's that good.

review/text: I purchased this tea based on the reviews here on amazon.com and because I so wholeheartedly agree, I am here now to back up all of the previous five-star comments. If you feel that the taste of green tea falls flat, this is an absolute solution. After reading that pesticides have been found in various teas, I now strive to only drink organic. I really can't say anything negative about this product! The value is amazing, you wont be disappointed!

review/summary: The very best green tea!
review/text: I drink this tea every day at work, at least two mugs of it!  I leave the bag in the entire time because I like my tea strong, and it never gets bitter.  I'm drinking some right now, in fact!  I've had kombucha before, but it's expensive to buy and I don't feel like bothering with it at home... add to that the fact that I really don't like encountering little stringy bits and globs in my beverage, no matter how healthy it is, and you'll understand why getting my kombucha this way is the perfect solution for me!  The little quotes on the ends of the Yogi tea bag strings also give me a moment of mindfulness in the middle of a workday, which is always pleasant and centering.<br /><br />I like many Yogi teas, but this is my very favorite.  You won't be disappointed!

The individual packaging is high quality, and the tea bags are kept very fresh.<br /><br />This Kombucha tea is tasty and has a wonderful aroma.  I'm not sure what kind of kombucha is in it though, because a big part of kombucha are the probiotics and obviously those would be absent from a packaged dry tea.  That being said, I love this tea and have recommended to friends.<br /><br />Flavor is a clean mint with plum.

review/text: The kombucha and the decaf kombucha are both really good.  No matter how long you oversteep this tea it does not get bitter & will still taste great.  This goes for all Yogi green teas.  My favorites are the kombuchas, green tea super anti-oxidant & green tea rejuvination. They are so good.  I drink Yogi teas every single day at work, normally with various different flavors of Yogi tea mixed together.  I like to steep 2 bags at once & always leave the tea bags in my mug.  You can re-use the tea bags but the 2nd time around will be a weaker brew.  I like strong green tea so i often use several tea bags at once.  Usually 2 to start out and then i re-use those 2 tea bags & add one more for the next cup.

review/text: I am really enjoying this tea. It has a delicious fruity taste and I am able to drink it without added sugar or sweetener.<br />I read that to enjoy the full health benefits of Kombucha the tea should not be heated and the bag should be left simmering in cold water. I have done that and I enjoy it. Although I really like my tea hot too so once in a while I will just make a traditional tea with this bag and hot water. Green tea is supposed to have a huge number of beneficial properties and this one tastes great. Japanese have a long established tradition about Kombucha but I am not Japanese, I just enjoy the taste and the benefits. Enjoy!

review/summary: My favorite tea
review/text: I had never heard of Kombucha, but our local discount store which sold great products would occasionally have Yogi teas.  I bought this one and loved it: regular green tea nauseates me, and whatever additives are put in this Yogi blend counteract that effect. I don't use sweetener/sugar with green tea, and the flavor is excellent without sweetening. Now here's the most interesting thing to me about this tea: the green tea portion has a mild stimulant effect, just enough to perk me up but not give me a jangly buzz. And whatever else they put in this blend (I'm assuming it's the Kombucha?) has a very relaxing effect on me similar to drinking a glass of wine.  Non-addictive relaxation aid?  Almost all other supposed relaxation-inducing herbal blends have the opposite effect on me, making me very restless, especially if I use them more than once.  I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced the calming effects of this blend ?

I use one tea bag and a quart jar filled with almost boiling water to make this into an iced tea.  I sweeten with Agave Light.  This is a very refreshing and yummy drink to me.<br /><br />I also drink this unsweetened as a hot tea or iced tea too.<br /><br />Will definitely order again.

review/summary: Plastic free packaging
review/text: I drink this tea or one of several other Yogi tea blends daily. Love it. This is the only brand I buy. As others have mentioned, this particular flavor doesn't taste much like green tea, which is great if you don't particularly like the taste of green tea (as I don't). Besides the flavor, and the cool company, what I really love about these teas is that neither the box nor the tea bags are wrapped in plastic. Thank you, Yogi Tea! Do we really need to kill the earth to have a cup of tea? I say "no, we do not!"

review/summary: Only buy this is you like the spearmint taste
review/text: Spearmint is a very strong flavor and it overpowers the whole tea. If you take a leaf and tear one and smell it, that is the aroma and taste of this tea. I personally cannot stand spearmint but this tea is good for you. I have to drink it fast and get a "blech" feeling afterwards, its just how I react to a minty tea.

review/summary: Best Tasting Yogi Green Tea
review/text: I drink hot and cold tea now instead of diet soda.  After trying many different brands and types, I've centered in on Yogi teas.  They have great flavors.  I drink Green tea in the AM and switch to herbals once I get to the office.  Of the several Green tea flavors Yogi makes, I prefer the Kombucha.  Give it a try.

review/summary: Mislabeled Product
review/text: When I first bought this product I fell in love, and when I stumbled across this great value of the kombucha tea by Yogi I thought it was a really good deal. Well, two week after I purchased the product; I opened the box, and the first thing I see is Kombucha DECAF! No wonder it was cheaper than the other prices. The original kombucha has 30 mg of caffeine, and this one has 5 mg. Okay, so it's decaf so what? I brewed one. I did not like it. It does not taste like the original kombucha. Plus I cannot return this product; therefore, this product gets one star. I am so upset and I will buy from another site.

review/summary: Very good and so healthy!
review/text: I have really been into Yogi tea and trying them all! I have all the green teas and after a month of testing them I conclude that Rejuvenation tastes the best. It has a natural peach and lemon flavor that is very natural and mild. Most say the Simply Green tastes the best but to me it was far too boring. I got used to all the special herbs and natural flavors and the Simply Green had none added. I do not like the artificial flavors at all, nor do I like the artificial sweet taste added by too much stevia leaf.<br /><br />Kombucha tea is my second favorite Yogi green tea. The flavors added are natural passion fruit and plum, but I prefer the lemon flavor in my green tea. The flavors are mild and pleasant however and this tea has the added health benefits of Kombucha but so does the Rejuvenation tea, which has this same ingredient in it.<br /><br />Slim Life tea is very good- Amazingly good compared to diet green tea pills! I do not ever feel the side effects of a diet pill with this tea and I drink a lot of it being I got 6 boxes from Amazon. I think it's a wonderful tea but I'd prefer it if the natural blueberry flavor was left out. It does taste natural and sweet but mixed with Green tea, I'd prefer the lemon or peach flavors myself. If you do love the flavor of berry in your tea, you will love this one and it is mild and pleasant to drink all day long.<br /><br />The Super Anti-Oxidant variety of tea tastes good except for the licorice. The licorice is okay in the bedtime and calming teas, but does not taste right in green tea. Other then the licorice it does have a very good lemon flavor that is soothing and mild. The Slim Life tea is also very good but it does have a blueberry flavor in it, but it is worlds better then the Fasting tea, which tastes the worst of all the Yogi teas. I just love the Yogi tea positive messages don't you? At first I just bought these teas for the messages then I learned to love the tea as well! Rejuvenation is my favorite green tea and Peach Detox and Redbush Chai are my favorite flavored teas and make exceptionally good iced tea as well! The flavors, however, are very close and it took me quite a while to figure out which green tea I preferred the best. This one is good if you like licorice in your green tea that is.<br /><br />Wise quotes from Yogi Tea by Yogi Bhajan<br /><br />"The universe is the stage on which you dance, guided by your heart."<br /><br />"The purpose of life is to enjoy every moment."<br /><br />"Delight the world with compassion, kindness and grace."<br /><br />"Laugh because that is your purpose in life."<br /><br />Happiness is every human beings birthright."<br /><br />"Be happy so long as breath is in you."<br /><br />"Real happiness lies in that which never comes nor goes, but simply is."<br /><br />"Travel light, live light, spread the light, be the light."<br /><br />"Your greatness is not what you have, it's what you give."<br /><br />"Practice kindness, mercy and forgiveness."<br /><br />"Bliss cannot be disturbed by gain or loss."<br /><br />"Compassion has no limit.

review/summary: Wish I had known more about Kombucha
review/text: After reading that some people have issues with Kombucha tea, I Googled it and read some more. I recommend that others do the same before drinking it. I am sure that Yogi Tea produces their Kombucha in a careful environment, but it can cause health problems. It also does not appear to be appropriate for people with Candida despite some claims. It contains alcohol, sugars, fungi, yeast and molds, and a study showed that it did not improve symptoms of people with Candida. I've been drinking it almost daily and have been having unexplained stomach aches lately and will try eliminating this tea to see if it helps, now that I know more. Again, read up on Kombucha and make your own informed decision.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like pesto.
review/text: I have to agree with the previous review that noted the taste of pickles in this pesto. That's exactly what I thought upon tasting it. It tastes like a combination of pickles and olives, which isn't an inedible combination, but not one I expected or particularly wanted. The part that made it almost inedible was the salt, and that's coming from someone who enjoys processed foods. This was just over-the-top salty. I'm just going to throw the stuff away. Shelf-stable pesto is a nice idea, but the refrigerated variety is the way to go.

review/summary: Unreasonably salty in my opinion
review/text: Too much salt in this product.  You'll regret using it if you have any other source of salt in your dish, e.g., pasta cooked in salted water, feta cheese, brined olives, etc.<br /><br />I far prefer the pesto marketed under the "Buitoni" brand (Nestle foods) that is sold in the refrigerated foods section at the grocery store, as that pesto has excellent taste without going over-the-top on salt.  The Classico product has almost 50% more salt in the same size serving, relative to the Buitoni pesto.<br /><br />I have nothing against salt, or salty foods, but the amount of salt in this Classico pesto is unjustifiable and may well spoil your dish.

review/summary: This cured our dog's separation anxiety!!
review/text: Our 70lb boxer suffered from extreme separation anxiety.  Any time we would leave him alone, he would scratch and chew up anything in sight into shreds, including a wooden doorway.  We tried everything: melatonin, scent diffusers, leaving the radio on, giving him raw beef bones.  Nothing worked.<br /><br />Finally, on a lark, I saw this on the shelf at the local health food store and figured, what the heck.  We gave him two capsules before leaving him alone.  Amazingly, it worked!!  After just a couple of weeks, we weaned him off to see whether he would go back to the anxiety.  He hasn't!  Somehow this supplement must have flipped the switch in his brain that was making him go bonkers.  And for that reason, it has been worth its weight in gold to us.

review/summary: calming effect
review/text: Our female dogs suffer from separation anxiety when we try to leave them to go out to dinner when traveling.  Because of the barking and whining that they could possibly make and fear of pissing off the tenants in the ajoining rooms we end up just eating in our room to keep them calm.  They howl or bark like crazy.  To aleviate the problem my husband stays with them and I go down to the restaurant to pick up the food and we just eat in our hotel room.  With this product we were able to give it to them within 1 hour to going out and they remained calm and quiet. We left the hotel room and the girls just sat their on the bed.  They were not groggy or sleepy just peaceful and calm. they did not even bark when someone walked passed the room window.  I don't use it often but when I do, it is so nice to know we can leave them and they remain calm and don't freak out.

review/summary: Nutritious for my Pregnant Doggie :}
review/text: I found this at a new pet store in Encino CA, after eating at Tony Roma's. I was looking for wet food that was very nutritious, made of lamb, beef or liver (I heard a lot of dogs and cats are allergic to chicken by products - but people don't really know about it.<br />I was looking for 'puppy' food for my pregnant dog.<br />I found this Lamb wet food. It said it was complete natural dog food for both puppies and adult dogs. So I tried it.<br /><br />I checked the ingredients for the Lamb formula, and it has NO;<br />* Meat by-products (ground/rendered/cleaned parts of necks/feet/undeveloped eggs/intestines - parts that are generally less nutritious and are of lesser quality)<br />* Chemicals<br />* Fillers<br />* CORN/Corn-meal (all dog/cat foods seem to be made of) Who wants to feed their animal Corn, to get them full?<br />* Meat substitutes<br />* CHICKEN MEAL (consists of chicken-flesh and skin without bone, feathers, organs, etc). Would you buy a chicken and strip the skin off it to feed to your pet?<br />* Artificial preservatives(BHA/BHT, ethoxyquin, propyl gallate) and MANY more!<br />* No Artificial Preservatives, Flavors, Colors or Bleached Ingredients.<br /><br />It does have Lamb Meal, which isn't something I like.<br />Although all around nutritious, I'm going to try 'Wellness Canned Dog Food for Puppy, 12pk of 12.5oz Cans.'<br />- Wellness can seems to have none of the above, and no chicken or lamb meal. It's cheaper too. A plus for me!<br /><br />ALWAYS read ingredients before purchasing cat or dog food. Even if the first ingredient is 'meat by product', or 'chicken meal', doesn't mean it's actual meat and nutritious for your pet. (It's the equivalent of a human eating imitation powdered mashed potato's instead of the real thing).<br /><br />Good luck!

review/text: I have been subscribing to this and other Kind products for over a year now, and have noticed that the bars are getting smaller and smaller, but the price keeps creeping up.<br /><br />It have become almost a game when the bars arrive: How much smaller are the bars going to be since the previous consignment of 3 months ago?  Maybe I should keep one from each shipment and compare its length when the next arrives.<br /><br />Of course the wrapper remains the same size, and that just adds to the fun.  I wonder if the bar will ever reduce to half the wrapper size.<br /><br />Apart from all this, the quality of the bars themselves has remained consistent, but the freshness varies from shipment to shipment.

review/text: I ordered the Fruit & Nut mini bars expecting to receive 20 individual mini bars since the description says 5 count pack of 4. However, as some other reviews indicated, what they actually ship you is 1 count pack of 4 - meaning 4 mini bars for the price of $22.xx. I contacted Amazon and they said they could not "fix" the problem but would offer me a full refund instead.<br /><br />If you are interested in these bars, order the regular size instead (as I did). They seem to be shipping correctly.

review/summary: Great bars, terrible seller.
review/text: Be aware, this seller is only fulfilled thru Amazon, not an Amazon product.  What was sent was 4 mini bars re-sealed, not a full package.<br /><br />From the description:"Pack of four boxes, each box contains 5 (0.8-Ounce) bars (total 20 bars, total 16 ounces)"  We only got 4 bars removed from the box and repackaged.<br /><br />The bars are fantastic and I love them but won't get them thru Amazon anymore.  Off to REI I go.

review/summary: The Best Snack Bar I've Ever Tasted
review/text: I've started working out.  The trainer inists I eat something every few hours and it's hard when I'm at work or traveling.  The workout program includes a nutritionist at no charge. She was adament that I stop using highly processed food bars and move to what she calls "real food" bars. This is the one she recommended and it's delicious.  I used to love another brand of bar that is more "processed" and now that I've been eating these more "real food" items I can barely stand the old stuff.  I love the apricot and the cranberry.  Great food.

review/summary: Love these...but was cheated!
review/text: These are the very best...but the boxes only contained 4 bars and appeared to have been carefully opened to allow one bar to be removed.  Please check your delivery if you purchase.
