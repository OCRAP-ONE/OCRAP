review/summary: Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie
review/text: My daughter stole it from me and ate it, I guess it's a good thing I can't stand oatmeal.  But both my kids are already huge fans of all things Quaker so it's easy for me to write this review.<br /><br />Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are chewy, nutrition and according to my kids, DELICIOUS.  They are made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats, individually packaged at $2.69 for a box of 6, is a good source of fiber, only contains 6 grams of total fat per cookie and sold pretty much EVERYWHERE!

review/text: I loved this delicious cookie! I even shared it with my 11 month old, and I'm a pretty big health nut when it comes to what I feed my daughter. It tasted great, was a great portion and it's not full of fats and sugars like all of those other cookies!

review/summary: very tasty
review/text: I love oatmeal cookies and have made them at least hundred times.  I love my cookies, but these come in a very close second to my under baked, soft homemade "vanishing oatmeal" cookies.<br />There's some ingredients in these cookies that I don't find in my kitchen cabinet, but if you're not against prepackaged food, it shouldn't bother you.<br /><br />I loved the allspice taste, but my guy friend didn't that much.  I think he's just partial to my cookies.  The individual serving size is nice.  I'm more apt to just have one cookie this way rather than opening a whole box and having to eat them before they get stale.  I could say that individually wrapping the cookie saves me from just having one more and one more and..........<br /><br />They are delicious and make me feel like I'm eating something that is somewhat healthy for me.  After all, there is oatmeal in the cookie.

review/summary: Good, but not homemade.
review/text: First thought--not as good as homemade.  Second thought--good anyways.  Homemade oatmeal cookies are chewy, moist, a slightly crisp outer layer... but these cookies are cakey throughout.  The other thing that sets them apart from homemade cookies is a slight taste of preservatives--or something--something different and packaged-tasting about the flavor.  They're not too sweet, which I like.  My kids have started revolting against granola bars and protein bars as snacks on our day-trips--I think this would be a good thing to take instead.  Filling, good energy boost, tastes better than an energy bar.

review/text: Good store bought cookie comes individually wrapped so every one is fresh.  Has a slightly burnt flavor, the bottoms of the cookies were very dark, almost burnt.  Soft and chewy with a sweet tast, could use more raisins and a stronger oatmeal flavor.  Overall, I liked them and my son loved them.  I guess the younger folks will like how sweet the cookie is.  Not like homemade but very good for store bought.

review/summary: Dry
review/text: Oatmeal cookies aren't my favorite but I do enjoy them from time to time but you would never know it by this cookie.  The first bite was pretty terrible, though they did seem to get better about half way through the cookie.  It was so dry and had a sawdust kind of texture.  I think the problem is the main ingredient is ground up oats, then with whole oats and wheat flour, instead of the recipes I've made with more whole oats and then wheat flour.  Even though I don't really like raisins they were the best thing about these cookies.  At least a bite with a raisin was a tiny bit moister.<br /><br />Not only that but it was 170 for only one cookie.  If this was a diet cookie, maybe I wouldn't be so harsh about the texture, but 170 for one cookie sure isn't diet food.<br /><br />2 stars.

review/summary: A tasy cookie from Quaker
review/text: Quaker products always mean good tasting.  They also mean a healthier option of processed snacks.  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookies are indeed soft and moist.  Each cookie is over an ounce; a nice size cookie.  You can see the whole oats and raisins.  I can taste the raisins and spices as well.  It is a tasty oatmeal raisin cookie.<br /><br />There are six individually wrapped cookies per box.  I like the individual wrapping as it keeps the cookies fresh and aids with portion control.  Per cookie you are looking at: 170 calories, 6g of fat, 27g carbohydrates, 4 g dietary fiber, 12g sugar, and 2g protein.  The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Nutritional facts are displayed on each individual wrapper as well, so nutrition, ingredient and allergy information is accessible even without the box or the internet.<br /><br />For a convenient, cheaper and healthier option, Quaker's cookies are a good choice.  I recommend these cookies.  I hope to try the chocolate almond flavor next!

review/text: I received a sample pack of the Raisin variety of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster to test out with my family.<br /><br />My 22 month old son loved the cookie and almost ate the whole thing himself. I did manage a couple bites and I love the soft, chewy-ness of the cookie. Plus, it provides a good source of fiber, something we don't incorporate enough of in our diets sometimes. I will definitely consider purchasing more of these cookies as a snack for my son!

review/text: The soft baked cookies are amazingly delicious! Even my children really enjoy them!! I was surprised when they all actually ate it because they never eat anything with raisins in it. This was exciting since I now keeps these with me in case the boys need a snack since they would be able to eat one between the four of them.

review/text: My kids will devour these cookies. They must be super good because believe it or not my kids are picky cookie eaters. I do not like raisins personally so I haven't tried them myself. My only negative thing I can think of is that they are very crumby because they are soft, so with kids it gets quite messy.

review/summary: Lunchbox or Work Staple
review/text: Quaker, which knows a thing or two about oats, has put together a pretty nice oatmeal cookie here. The cookie is soft, as advertised, but is NOT pillowy, doughy, gooey or some other displeasing variety of soft. Rather, it just has a nice yielding softness. No doubt related to the consistency, the cookie is not cloyingly sweet. Oh, it's still definitely a cookie - but you're not overwhelmed with a sugar rush. The raisins didn't add a lot of flavor - the ones I encountered weren't large or anything remotely like plump.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like a relatively low-guilt addition to a lunchbox or a desk drawer for snack time. Tasty, soft, and full of oatmealy goodness.

review/summary: Over-Packaged Product
review/text: In one box you get six cookies, each individually wrapped.  Which is all meant to be quite convenient, I suppose.  Throw one in your child's lunchbox and send him/her off.  Frankly, these cookies are not nearly as delicious as the ones my husband and I make and ours are lower in fat and calories, with fewer additives.  In other words, healthier.<br /><br />But "healthier" isn't why most people buy pre-made food products and these cookies taste good enough.  I love oatmeal raisin cookies and I wasn't disappointed by these enough to dislike them.  However, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L5UD2K">Grandma's Homestyle Oatmeal Raisin Big Cookie, 2.5 Oz Bag (Pack of 20)</a> are lower in calories and have the same amount of fat, per cookie.  (Of course, it's hard to eat just the one when there are two in the package so you'd have to share.)<br /><br />I know that it's hard to find time to bake from scratch sometimes but the effort to do so, teaching a child how to measure and mix a recipe from scratch, to then enjoy something that the two (or three or four) of you made together, is invaluable.  Make a double batch and freeze the dough before baking and you wouldn't have to do this every week to have enough cookies to last entire month or longer.  You'll build bonding moments, create less waste, teach simple mathematics and cooking skills, and provide a far healthier snack option for your child(ren).<br /><br />And if you truly don't have the time to bake cookies, then buy some fresh fruit.  If nothing else, you'll have fewer additives and most fruit comes in it's own convenient packaging.

review/summary: Well, the foil packet is handy...
review/text: Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies (raisin) fail the most important test of a cookie.  They are not delicious.  Considering they're 170 calories for ONE cookie you'd expect something decadent.  It's not even as tasty as an average cookie.<br /><br />A little bit dry considering it's supposed to be soft, moist cookie.  A slight sandy or grainy texture.  There's nothing foul or obnoxious about the taste - it's just nothing special.<br /><br />Nutritionally - ok for a cookie.  170 calories, 1.5g sat fat.  4g fiber!  (quite a bit.)  But I don't look at a cookie as some sort of health food.  A big* cookie like this should be an indulgence - a treat.  Instead it's not abhorrent.  If you start eating this, you'll finish it.  But you won't go out of your way for another one.<br /><br />*not THAT big.  It's not like a famous amos or something.

review/text: I got to try these through Influenster. Though I'd planned to buy my own, I'm glad I had to do it for the site, because otherwise I wouldn't have tried the Oatmeal Raisin. I'm not a fan of the combo. I don't know why.<br />But, Quaker did a great job. There was the perfect combination of oatmeal to raisin, and I didn't feel like I was tasting cardboard, as I tend to with oatmeal cookies. Instead, it was super moist, and honestly, if it had been hot, I would have assumed it was straight from the oven. Just perfectly done!

review/summary: Not my mother's oatmeal cookie
review/text: Generally, these Quaker oatmeal cookies were a disappointment.  The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are 170 calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around 3 inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only "fortifications" to the cookie are calcium (4%) and iron (8%).

I did notice it was a little heavy in the cinnamon department, so if you don't like cinnamon or if you have an allergy to it, then this would not be a good cookie for you.  This was shared with my 14 year old daughter that gave her seal of approval, too.

review/summary: Great Snack Alternative for Kids and Adults!
review/text: I'm not a fan of oatmeal or raisins (lol) but I wanted to taste the cookie before I gave it to my daughter. So I'll give my review based on how well she liked it. The cookie was extremely fresh when I opened it. My daughter ate about half of the cookie before putting the pack down. So I'll take that as she was somewhat satisfied because if she doesn't like it, she throws it aways and if she really likes it she'll eat it all! Ha! I am interested in finding out what other types of cookies are available because it is a more healthier alternative versus her eating chips or candy.<br /><br />**NOTE: In my review, I only took into account my thoughts on the cookie itself.  But if I had to grade this with the price that Amazon has it for, I would probably give it 1 star!  A 6-pack of these cookies is $2.69 so why is a 12-pack almost $35 on here?! Am I missing something, lol**

review/text: I love oatmeal raisin cookies, really love them.  So, I am always on the lookout for a good cookie...especially if they are made by someone other than me.  When I got the chance to sample Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins, I said "Why not?"  The cookies come 6 to a box and are individually wrapped.  They are pleasant soft oatmeal with a balanced blend of spices and raisins.  I would have liked more raisins.  They were also very soft almost, as another reviewer mentioned...powdery.  They did have a good taste and they are very convenient (good for lunches, tucked in a backpack or desk drawer) and I found them very filling/satisfying.  But, for me, they were just a bit off mark.  I guess I expected a soft oatmeal cookie to be a bit more solid and chewy.  I will buy them occasionally if I have a specific need for something quick and easy.

review/summary: Bland, but great for older adults
review/text: QUAKER SOFT BAKED OATMEAL COOKIES RAISINS is a product consisting of a box of six cookies.  Each of the six cookies is enclosed in a sturdy plastic envelope, with a tooth-edge at the top and bottom, suitable for grasping and for tearing open the envelope.  On the plus side, all of the cookies were intact, despite shipping.  The intact nature of the cookies was largely due to the fact that they are soft (not crunchy) and secondarily due to the secure packaging.  The cookies were bland and unadventuresome, both in taste and in texture.  Although the photographs on the cardboard box and on the plastic envelope show cookies having a surface dotted withabout 12 whole raisins, it was the case that the actual cookie contains a scattering of chopped raisin bits inside.  Therefore, the consumer should not expect to be treated to a cookies bearing a cargo of plump, juicy raisins.  In paying attention to the flavor, I noticed that the cookies had a detectable raisin flavor.  Also on the plus side, in knowing (from first-hand experience) that hard oatmeal can get wedged in between fillings, resulting in damage to teeth and fillings, the older consumer will be pleased that this QUAKER product is totally inocuous, as far as dental work is concerned.  These cookies are, indeed, sooooooft!<br /><br />Ordinary oatmeal has about 61 grams carbohydrate, 12 grams protein, and 7 grams fat, per 100 grams of oatmeal (Pomeranz (1987) Modern Cereal Science and Technology (pages 350-370)).  The NUTRITION FACTS label that this QUAKER product shows that the breakdown is as follows.  Each QUAKER cookie (42 grams) contains 27 grams carbohydrate, 6 grams of fat, and only 2 grams of protein.  Hence, it can be seen, that the cookies, as compared to straight oatmeal, is somewhat low in protein.  The low protein content should not be a concern to most adults, because growth, and the issue of acquiring the proper nutrient balance to sustain growth, is generally relevant only during pregnancy and lactation, and for growing children.  If any conclusion can be made regarding this fine product, is that it could be a preferred snack food for adults who have had multiple dental fillings, and need to worry about dental damage.  Although this cookie is fine for children, please remember that much better sources of protein are available, e.g., milk, cheese, meat, fish, poultry, tofu, and legumes (peas, beans, lentils).

review/summary: Surprisingly good cookie!
review/text: I love homemade oatmeal raisin cookies, the kind that are a little chewy, made with lots of oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and not too many raisins.  So I was skeptical of this soft, "store bought" cookie.  I assumed it would be, well, bad.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It's made with whole grains, which imbues each cookie with 16% of daily fiber recommendations.  It was indeed soft, but it didn't seem artificially so, more like it was just cooled down from the oven.<br /><br />As I began my 'taste test', I appreciated the fact that the cookies are individually wrapped, which allows for easy transport in lunches or purses.  I took a small bite at first, because I was already prepared to be disappointed.  As that bite went down, I reached for another.  Then another.  Very tasty, as it turned out!  Soon the cookie was gone and I realized I wanted another one!  However, at 170 calories each, these are NOT "low calorie", they're just made with better ingredients than most.<br /><br />As for other nutrition information (other than the fiber and calorie count mentioned above), each cookie has 150 milligrams of sodium, so not too bad there.  You'll find 4% of calcium and 8% of iron (recommended daily requirements).<br /><br />The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Sugar is about number 10 or so on the ingredient list.  One quibble I have is that the list of ingredients is rather lengthy.  My nutritionist has advised me to watch for products with what seem like extraordinarily long ingredient lists, probably means there's lots of stuff in there that's not exactly "good" for us, but it is what it is:  a factory-made, store-bought cookie that's got a pretty long list of ingredients and shelf life that don't come naturally to "homemade cookies".  Just accept it for what it is, a decent, convenient mass-produced cookie.

review/summary: Pretty durn good cookie.
review/text: Taste: I thought these did a good job of mimicking the taste of home made cookies. Cinnamony and raisiny (though the raisins aren't big plump raisins...they're more suggestions of raisins...and they are sweetened by sugar and fructose NOT HFCS.<br /><br />Mouth feel: When Mom makes oatmeal cookies, you can feel the oat meal (usually) when you are chewing. This doesn't have that. The oats are milled to the point where the flavour is there but the texture is not. If this is a problem for you, you might want to pass. Other than that, it's probably a good idea to have a glass of milk handy. They are "moist" in that they aren't crunchy...but they verge on dry.<br /><br />Value: On Amazon, the cookies come to about .50$ a piece. Which is comparable to my local grocery.<br /><br />A good all around (large) cookie and I think I will try the other varieties...you should too!

The cookie also does have enough raisins for it to qualify as oatmeal raisin, which was something I was concerned about at first.<br /><br />The cookie is very soft and still tastes pretty fresh, even after all the packing and processing that obviously went into it. They're about as big as you'd imagine it to be from the picture on the box, which is actually impressive given how often cookies end up being smaller than they appear. Overall, this is a good choice if you want cheap, store-bought oatmeal cookies.

review/summary: This cookie is a winner
review/text: This oatmeal cookie was delicious - soft, full of raisins and not too sweet or sugary.  Full of whole grain, I feel confident eating this cookie and giving it to my family to eat as well.  Great item to have in the bag for a quick snack that feels like a treat and is filling too!  Thanks to Quaker and Influenster for introducing me to this product!

review/summary: Good, Portable Snack
review/text: Quick breakdown of the cost.  For $34.71 you got 12 boxes of 6 cookies.  That's about $2.90 a box, and 49 cents per cookie.  NOT too bad.<br /><br />Taste-This is a denser cookie than I usually enjoy, especially when it comes to my oatmeal raisin.  (My favorite cookie, by the way!)  It almost has a cake like consistency, and while it isn't the type of cookie I would munch on at home while I watch a Blu-Ray, this is the type of snack I would buy for road trips or picnics.  There is a hint of brown sugar, not overwhelming, but enough that my little ones (8 and 4) remarked that they liked the sweetness of it.  My oldest, wished there were more raisins, and I would have to agree with that as well.  But I liked the whole grains. Overall, it is good, but a bit dry.<br /><br />Size-this is a larger cookie, similar to what you would get in say Subway or Starbucks.  Not overly huge, but not too small either.  I think this is a perfect snack size.<br /><br />Nutrition-at 170 calories it isn't a lightweight, but nor is it overly fattening either.  6 Grams of fat, 1.5 grams of Saturated (NOT horrific), but it has some Polyunsaturated and 3.5 grams of Monounsaturated=the 'good' kind of fat.  4 grams of fiber, good in a snack like this, but only 2 grams a protein, wish there was more.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't a snack I would buy on a regular basis.  Maybe once in awhile for school lunches, and I would certainly get this for a road trip, or a hike.  Compared to many other snacks like this, it is a decent value for the money, and if you enjoy a thicker cookie, this is right up your alley!

review/text: These cookies are soft and chewy and the real raisins add a nice touch.  While they are 170 calories per cookie, the good taste makes them worth it.  They are also individually wrapped which makes them easy to add to a packed lunch.  They are almost as good as mom used to make!

review/text: I sampled this product for the Influenster Mom Vox Box that I received in the mail.  I am purchase Quaker cereals on a regular basis and was excited to try this cookie.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the cookie and felt it stayed true to the Quaker brand.  I did not like the fact there were so many preservatives in the cookie like TBHQ and BHT.  For those reasons I will not be purchasing this on a regular basis.

review/text: I recieved the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal and Raisins Cookie in my Influenster Mom Voxbox 2012. My husband and kids devoured the cookie before I had a chance to look at it or taste it. So this is what they thought of the cookie. It was sooooo good according to my 4 year old son and 3 year old daughter. My husband said it was moist and soft and delicious. He is most definitely ready for me to asdd it to the grocery list. I gave this product a 5 star rating because these cookie totally rock!!!

review/text: I got the opportunit to try Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster in my Mom VOX BOX.<br /><br />I enjoyed the chewy, soft-baked cookies made with wholesome Quaker Oats and delicious raisins. They are cookie and not as moist as a bar, but wonderful none the less. They offer the following benefits:<br /><br /> -Made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats<br />-Individually packaged<br />-Provides a good source of fiber<br />-Contains 6 grams of total fat per serving

review/summary: You can actually taste the oatmeal :)
review/text: As part of Influenster I received a Mom VoxBox full of great products to try and review.  Included was a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie.  I don't like raisins so I gave most of it to my kiddos.  I did take a taste though and it was delicious.  A lot of store bought oatmeal cookies don't taste good at all but this was so good.  You could see the oats and everything.  What a great special treat to have with whole grains to get that extra fiber we all need.  I can't wait to go and buy some in a different flavor.  :)
