review/summary: Dented Cans- great product
review/text: First I will say that the oatmeal is a great tasting product. This is my second subscription delivery. This is the first time I have had dented cans. There are major dents.The lid will not fit on one can. A note about packaging: The cans were sent shrink wrapped with the lids off all the cans. The taste is not affected by the dents,as there is a foil seal under the lids.<br />I do not regret the purchase, and will continue to buy as I am unable to get the oatmeal otherwise.This oatmeal does not taste like the rolled oatmeal you see in the store. It reheats well after being cooked also. I have not tried the quick cook method yet.

review/text: This is the most delicious oatmeal we've ever had. It's got a hearty, almost nutty flavor.  It's more nutritious because it's not processed like other brands.  Well worth the price and the time. It takes some time to cook (about 30 min or so), but leftovers can be refigerated and warmed in the microwave and it still tastes great.

review/summary: Unique and healthly.
review/text: This  is one of the best things in the world for you to eat, and may well be THE best. This is old fashion oatmeal, and it takes a lot of time to prepare compared to Quaker oats. If you are a novice to this type of product, let me tell you how my Wife prepares it for convenient use. Get a rice cooker The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3Q1I2">Sanyo ECJ-N100W 10-Cup Electric Rice Cooker with Porridge/Soup Cooker and Steamer</a> looks good, and use the porridge setting. You can use some old butter or whipped cream type plastic containers, and store the cooked oatmeal in the freezer. You can then nuke it in a few minutes for breakfast, or if you want a healthly late night snack. I know the purists will condem me for Americanizing this, but we are Americans... if it is not convenient we will not use it as often as we should.

Bring four cups of water to the boil, add one cup of oatmeal and simmer gently for 30 (yes 30) minutes. Add milk and honey, and you have a biblically good breakfast, nutritious, delicious.

review/summary: Not A Pack Of Four
review/text: I have not tasted this oatmeal yet but I do anticipate it to be very good.  It did not come as a four pack though.  It came as 4 separate cans that were not packed well at all.  They were loose without any packaging material in the over sized box.  All 4 cans came severely dented and look as though I purchased them from a bargain shelf.  The $10 S+H fee seems a bit steep for this type of careless packing.

review/summary: McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal
review/text: If it were not for the LOUSY packaging, I would rate McCann's Irish Steel Cut Oatmeal 5 stars.  The oatmeal is delicious with a nutty flavor and I will never be able to eat regular oatmeal again after having tasted it.  Plus, it is so good for you.  My family loves the oatmeal.<br /><br />Having said that, however, the people or department responsible for preparing the oatmeal for mailing should be terminated. I have ordered three separate times and each time the oatmeal containers arrive damaged.  I even complained to Customer Service and all they did was send me more oatmeal free to replace what I had received.  The free shipment was also damaged. This oatmeal comes in these really beautiful tins that would be reusable in so many different ways, i.e., filling the tin with steel cut oatmeal cookies as a gift, but the cans are so dented up that you can't use them.  Fortunately, this does not affect the quality of the oatmeal, but I feel like I am being ripped off because none of the beautiful cans are salvageable.  Apparently this is not important to Customer Service (I have seen several complaints from other reviewers about the same thing) or they would do something about it.  I am going to try and find another source for this delicious oatmeal.

review/summary: It's all a matter of opinion, or taste buds!
review/text: I cooked this Irish porridge with Soy Dream soy milk instead of water, since my family and I like oatmeal (with rolled oats) with this milk, and let it simmer for 25 minutes. I added 2 tsps of brown sugar, as somebody suggested, and some raisins. I absolutely loved it, and devoured it in a couple of minutes, going back for more. My wife, however, did not like it, and said that the texture is like what she imagines it would feel like in your mouth if one were to eat bugs!!! So, as you see, it's all a matter of opinion, or taste buds. I imagine this product is one of those that, either you love it, or hate it! Enrique and Paula, Lakeville, MN

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I've been an oatmeal addict for quite awhile, but it was always Quakers rolled oats, until i found steel cut oats. Much creamier and nuttier tasting. I do mine in a crock pot... 1 cup oats to 5 cups water which makes them come out a little creamier, also a pinch of salt. I tried the stove top method and forget it..lol..I dont have that much time to waste and I do believe that the crock pot method is better. I make enough and keep the rest in the fridge and just re-heat in the morning adding a little water.  I knocked off 1 star because of the price as I have gotten organic steel cut oats from my local co-op for about 1/3 the price. Overall a great product and a cool can.

review/text: I bought this after reading the raving reviews.  It is undoubtedly, healthy for you.  It also takes a lot of time to cook and you need to bring your creative side into the kitchen to make it palatable.  Since I now have several cans of this stuff (the cans are smaller than the photo appears, by the way, so check the size) to consume, I've purchased some sugar free jam to mix with it to give it (hopefully) a hint of flavor.  Quite frankly I just don't see the "wow factor" with this oatmeal.  I'm going to finish it since I bought it (although the idea did cross my mind to pawn it off on relatives as an unusual gift idea), but afterwards it is back to Quaker Oats for me.<br /><br />UPDATE 08/04/08:  I find it really interesting that when your opinion differs from the more popular ones, your review is considered "unhelpful" ;)

review/summary: Poor packaging
review/text: We were really looking forward to receiving and trying the oatmeal.  The 4-Pack arrived today.  The box in which they were shipped was busted up in a couple of places and the postal people had to tape it up.  One can was busted open and the oats were emptied out in the box. The other three cans were badly dented and the seam on one was coming open with oats leaking out.  I would have expected better packing for the type cans the oats come in.<br /><br />I will send another review after we've tried the oats from the surviving cans. This is a very big disappoinment and I hope future shipments will be packed better for shipping.  Please advise as to what type compensation you would offer.<br /><br />Hoping for better results in the future.

review/text: From reading other reviews before I bought this item, I was expecting something other than what I got.  I love regular Quaker Oats; however, I had heard how much better steel cut oats were for you. I just tried them this morning and was very disappointed.  If you are expecting something that qualifies for "comfort food" like regular oats do for me, then don't order this item.  I was expecting something creamy and full of flavor; but I got crunchy, chewy, and bland.  I kept thinking the oats would soften; so, I cooked them an additional ten minutes.  They never did.  I guess I'll stick with my regular oats.

review/summary: Get educated, save $
review/text: Even at $6 per canister, this product is inexplicably overpriced. Let me explain why:<br /><br />Intro to Oats 101--Oats, in whole form, are known as groats. In an effort to cut down on cooking time (or eating time, for those on the run, who don't have the time or patience to chew @mouthful 20-30x), oats are refined into the following:<br /><br />  -steel cut oats--cracked into two or more pieces<br />  -oat flakes--flattened with an oat roller<br />  -oatmeal--same as flakes, but parboiled<br />  -instant oatmeal--more processed than reg. oatmeal<br />  -oat flour--milled into dust, for baked goods or as a thickening<br />  agent.<br /><br />This product fits into the first catagory.  Their claim of "guaranteed uniformity" is a coined phrase, meaning each cracked grain is the same size, a gourmet characteristic.<br /><br />All this being said, I am not aware of oats from Scotland or Ireland having any magical or mystical quality, outside of marketing hype or myth.  Truth be told, you could go to any health food store with a bulk bin (one sign of a conscientious health food store), buy whole oats, certified organic, for about $2 per lb., and crack your own oats with a grain mill (Corona brand, one time investment, about $70, lifetime expectancy), or in a blender. For those more ambitious, you could cook them whole, which involves soaking them overnight, then simmering for about 90 minutes. Do not be put off by the cooking time, it is unattended, with a flame deflector. Cooking becomes a chore because of prep time, not the time on the stove.<br />Why whole? Because any time you grind or crack a grain, there is nutrient loss and, to those open to more estoteric models, a loss of life force (a.k.a. "chi").<br /><br />I did buy this product, and as connoisseur of oats, I was not impressed, did not give the same energy boost as others. Did not taste fresh, either.<br /><br />Now, onto an advanced concept: if you truly want the "Rolls Royce" of oats, there is a brand called "Really Raw Oats". Why is this? Because the oats commercially available are partially steamed to protect against rancidity (oats are about 10% fat, albeit an exceptionally healthful fat).  How do I know this? Because a truly raw grain will sprout. Attempts to sprout other oats have been fruitless.<br /><br />The Really Raw Oats carry a price tag of about $11 per lb., but are worth it. Conversely, the product here, in my opinion, does not command the price point it seeks.<br /><br />p.s.  the best TASTING oats I had came out of Canada--when you dry-roasted them in a pan, it took on the aroma of vanilla--BLISS! Haven't seen them, however, since the mid 1990's. I purchased from Lynn Paterson, who was pictured in David Sergel's fine book, "Zen Shiatsu"<br /><br />Bon Appeite, Good Health and Caveat Emptor<br /><br />-Andrew

review/summary: Great Oatmeal, Poor Shipping
review/text: We eat 'slow cook' oatmeal, because it has more fiber and nutrients, so my wife is used to cooking our oatmeal longer.  Most people are used to instant oatmeal which you just add hot water to.  Neither slow cook or steel cut are like that.  So, if you don't like taking the extra time to cook your oatmeal don't get steel cut.<br /><br />The oatmeal has a geat flavor, and is very filling.  It may have a completely different texture from any oatmeal you'ver ever eaten.  Several people have stated that it has a nutty texture and nutty flavor, they're correct.  Our whole family loves the taste.<br /><br />My only complaint isn't with the oatmeal, but with Amazon's packaging.  Several other buyers complained about this, so I was aware of it.  They put the oatmeal in a box bigger than it needed to be and then didn't pack the oatmeal firmly.  So, the cans moved around and knocked into each other during shipment.  We ordered 2 (pack of 4) sets, and they were shipped separately, although they arrived one day apart.  Of the 8 cans we received only 4 made it without blemish.  One was badly dented, and 3 slightly dented.  So, if you are getting the oatmeal in the cans with hopes of giving them as gifts, or something along those lines, be aware that you may not be able to do so.<br /><br />All things considered I would buy the steel cut oatmeal again.

review/text: I use a small crockpot (about a quart size) and fill it with water within an inch and a half of the top, then add about 3/4 cup of the oats and a dash of salt, a handful of raisins, and a half teaspoon of cinnamon. I cook it about 5-6 hours. (Overnight is a little too long.) So I cook it during the day, put it in a container, and reheat a serving in a bowl in the microwave in the morning. The advantage of this method is that you don't need to watch or stir while the oats are cooking since they don't stick to the bottom of the crockpot.

review/summary: Delicious and healthful
review/text: Two health articles I read recently recommended eating steel cut oats. After some research I came across the John McCann brand at Amazon which turned out to be a stroke of luck. It is truly delicious and I'm delighted that I signed up for a regular supply.<br />After cooking the recommended way for a few days I tried the suggestion made by another reviewer of boiling the four cups of water (I use two cups of water and two of low-fat milk - wonderful!) the night before, stirring the cup of oats in, putting a lid on and placing it in the refrigerator to 'cook' overnight. IT WORKS (thanks Amazon for reviews!) - though I prefer to leave it sitting out for an hour or so to cook in its own heat and then place it in the fridge before going to bed. Next morning all you have to do is heat on the stove or in the microwave (takes seconds!)and you've got a delicious, healthful breakfast with minimal effort.

review/summary: Don't be put off by the "slow cooked" title -- it can be fast
review/text: Forget the other tricks -- steel cut oats is something that could have been tailor-made to pre-prepare in the era of refrigeration.  About once a week or so in the evening when I'm in the kitchen cooking something else anyway, I partially cook up a pot of oats (I've always used McCanns, which is great, and I'm going to try some from the local health food store out of the bin -- I'll then decide whether to switch.)<br /><br />Anyway, 4 cups of water brought to a boil, 1 cup of oats added and simmered until the oats are just starting to get a little chewy, then turn off the heat and let it sit to cool.  Some extra cooking and softening will take place while it is cooling, but you want to leave them pretty chewy.  Then, into a sealed plasticware container in the fridge.  The amount of tending that is needed is minimal during this process -- just occasional stirring to keep it from sticking until the heat is turned off.<br /><br />Each morning, I scoop out what I want (for me, 2/3 of a cup), add a little water, stir it up, and microwave for just under a minute and a half.  Sprinkle on some cinnamon and freshly cut up fruit and raw slivered nuts. and you have about as healthy a breakfast item as you could want --  no more than a 2-3 minutes of morning prep time.  High fiber, complex carbs, no gluten, low calorie, and it stays with you all morning.<br /><br />Once you get into this routine, you'll wonder why you ever touched instant or quick oatmeal, or any rolled oats for that matter.  You'll learn to adjust how long you want the initial cook to be, how much water to add before microwaving, and how long to microwave depending on how soft you want the final bowl of oats to be, depending on your personal taste.  I feel more satisfied with a chewy oatmeal and think it tastes better a little undercooked, but to each his own.<br /><br />Only downside preventing 5 stars?  McCann's is a bit expensive compared to bulk steel-cut oats that is available to many, but a can goes a long ways, and is certainly cheap compared to most unhealthy "quick" breakfast foods.  Compare for yourself with what is in the bins at your local organic stores and decide for yourself if the extra price is worth it, but if you haven't eaten steel cut oats yet you owe it to yourself to try it.  Also, I've lived places where McCann's was the only steel-cut oats that could be found at the local grocer, so in a choice between McCanns and a cereal other than steel cut oats,  -- spend the money.<br /><br />This is basically the only grain I eat.  Another caveat -- I've never bought it through Amazon, but I would imagine that the quality is going to be very uniform for this product regardless of source.

review/summary: Steel cut where have you been all my life?
review/text: Like many people, I grew up eating Oatmeal for breakfast some days, especially during the winter months. My memories of it were not terribly fond though, as it was always soupy and weak. We always had to dump on the brown sugar or maple syrup to give it any flavor whatsoever.<br /><br />I continued to buy instant oatmeal through college and into adulthood, but would always use far less water than called for on the package, mainly just to give it some texture. I thought that was the best oatmeal could get.<br /><br />Then one day someone made me a bowl of steel cut oatmeal, and it was seriously like Oatmeal reinvented! For one it looks nothing like rolled oats--instead of flat little flakes these are like little pellets. When cooked, steel cut oatmeal gets an awesome "al dente" consistency that is both smooth and chewy. But more importantly, steel cut oatmeal has a wonderful rich flavor I've never tasted in rolled oats. I find that with this I only add a very minimal amount of sweetener (usually maple syrup but honey also works). Sometimes I add some cranberries or fresh blueberries if I have them, but it is perfectly delicious sans extras.<br /><br />Yes, it takes preparation, but it's the best use of my rice cooker I've found (ironically I use it more for oatmeal than I do for rice!). I just pour in the oatmeal and water the night before, set the cooker to porridge mode and set the timer for whatever time I want to eat. In the morning, I wake up to the wonderful smell of the cooking oats and by the time I'm dressed and ready for breakfast, they're all ready to go.<br /><br />I can't recommend these highly enough. They're really good tasting, yet good for you. Hard to beat that!

review/summary: Healthy and delicious
review/text: I've read many places and heard Dr. Oz say that the only oatmeal that really has the health benefits is steel cut oats.  I just love this stuff.  I make a large amount and eat it cold all week.  I use 8 cups of water, 1/2 cup non-fat dry milk, mix it, bring to a boil, and then dump in 2 cups of the oats.  Stand by the pot and keep stirring so it doesn't overflow the pot or stick to the bottom.  I love the flavor and the sort of crunch.  It would also be good with dried cranberries and some walnuts or slivered almonds.  It's a few pennies cheaper at Trader Joe but they don't always have it.  I've been eating it every day and thoroughly love it.<br /><br />EDITED TO GIVE A GREAT AND EASY WAY TO COOK STEEL-CUT OATS:<br />After a few batches, I have perfected this stovetop technique for steel-cut oats:<br />1. boil 4 cups of water in a pot on the stove<br />  (optional:  1/2 cup non-fat dry milk to up the calcium)<br />2. add 1 1/2 cups of steel-cut oats<br />3. bring to rolling boil again<br />4. cover tightly and let it keep boiling for a few seconds<br />5. turn off flame and forget about it.<br /><br />It doesn't take too long, under 1/2 hour I think but not sure, and the water is totally absorbed and you have the perfect combination of creamy/chewy steel-cut oats.<br /><br />You get enough for quite a few servings; not sure how many. 10 maybe??<br /><br />Nothing stuck to the bottom of the pot. What a delight.<br /><br />Much better than standing over the pot and stirring and much better than cooking in a slow cooker.<br /><br />(Learned this on egullet!)

review/summary: Who knew there was such a thing as premium oatmeal?
review/text: This was a splurge purchase.  My wife knows that I occasionally will go on a health kick and eat oatmeal for breakfast.  She got me this almost as a gag.  I was very happily surprised by the quality.<br /><br />First, I like the retro packaging.  It looks like I'm going to have something "old school" for breakfast, from an era when my dad says that Grape-Nuts would "almost break your teeth".  It's silly, but the esthetics of food do play a big role in how much we enjoy it.<br /><br />Still, packaging wouldn't mean anything if the taste wasn't there.  Happily, these oats have more texture and flavor than any others I have eaten.  Will the taste blow you away?  Well, truthfully, no.  You could argue that "tastiest oatmeal" is kind of like being "tallest dwarf" or "smartest stooge".  This is also not a product to consider if you are feeding three teenagers on a budget.  What I would say is that if you like oatmeal and don't mind spending a bit more for quality, at least consider treating yourself to a can.

These oats aren't quite as good as McCann's, but they're pretty darn close in these times of austerity.  If you have a Trader Joe's nearby, give them a try.

review/text: McCann's Irish oatmeal is quite different than traditional rolled oats in both texture and flavor.  Note that it takes a half hour to cook, so it is not a good choice for workdays.  I prefer normal rolled oats, but this is a nice change occasionally.  It is very dense, similar to al dente pasta in texture; it is the equivalent of grape-nuts for oatmeal.  On a per pound basis, it is more expensive than rolled oats.<br /><br />Cracker Barrel's oatmeal is similar to McCann's.  Recommend you try it there before purchasing.

If your price is higher than Whole Foods, you know you need to revisit it!<br /><br />But, there is something available at Amazon that will make cooking the oatmeal a breeze, especially on weekdays, this little, Proctor Silex 1.5 quart slow cooker!

When you wake up, you'll have perfectly cooked oatmeal without standing over the stove.  It makes between 2-4 servings depending on how much oatmeal you can eat at a sitting!  We get 4 out of it with two grownups and to kids. Another plus is that you can keep the oatmeal warm in this pot for quite a while, accommodating a family where everyone doesn't get up at the same time.

I found McCanns' was available in a couple of stores there for a premium price, stocked up, and learned how to prepare it. A quick visit to the McCann website gave me some shortcuts on prep (it is NOT instant oatmeal), and some more surfing found me at amazon, where the price is right.

One taste of the rich nuttiness & chewiness of this porridge will convince you to ban rolled oats, especially the instant varieties, from your household. There is nothing instant about this product; it does take time to boil water, add the oats & cook for 30 minutes. The flip side is you can make a batch once a week & eat from it for several days by reheating a portion in the microwave...it truly is worth the effort.

review/summary: Robust and filling
review/text: Growing up in England porridge or "porage" if you came from Scotland was a staple food in our house, especially in winter, and although I never liked the traditional made with water and salt version, sugar or syrup were always an alternative for a healthy and filling (and warming breakfast)<br />Most oatmeal available here in the USA (including the instant microwave stuff) is a pretty stodgy, slimy affair, that even though it tastes OK for the most part, is a mile removed from this McCann's steel cut Oatmeal.<br />This stuff is far more granular (so you use less) robust, and tasty, almost a nutty kind of grape nuts texture that is flavorful and nutricious, as well as filling, with only the addition of some sugar or sweetener to personal taste.<br />I purchased 4, 28 ounce tins on a Gold Box deal, but even at full price, they are not as expensive as they may appear, given the price of most other breakfast cereals today, especially the high price "organic" tagged ones.<br />It does take about 30 minutes to make, so a lot of people will not like that compared to the convenience of "instant" oatmeal, but I see that some reviewers have some tips for shorter cook times with a microwave.<br />For me, I like the idea of the tin instructions if you don't have 30 minutes in the morning.<br />Bring 4 cups of water to the boil per one cup of oatmeal in a saucepan, remove from heat, cover and cool and put in the refrigerator overnight, then cook in the morning for about 9 minutes on stovetop. This actually makes the finished article a little softer than fresh made, but still great in taste and texture.<br />The above measures are for about 4 servings (3 if like me, you have extra!) and I only add 4 teaspoons (one per serving) to the mix of raw cane sugar while cooking for a nice grainy but little sweeter taste.<br />A no doubt 5 star review for probably the best tasting and healthiest oatmeal (or porridge) I have tasted. Try some!

review/summary: The BEST oatmeal, like a dessert for breakfast!
review/text: This is the BEST oatmeal anywhere on the planet! I found a quick and easy way to cook it for those that like lots of fruit. I use a 'fuzzy logic" rice cooker on the porridge setting (2 hrs.) but set my kitchen timer for only 25 minutes--which is all it takes to cook as it is a sealed rice cooker that steams the contents as it cooks. I use 1/2 of a rice cup measurer of oatmeal, 3/4 of a regular liquid measuring cup of water, 3/4 of a reg. liquid measuring cup of either cranberry, apple or pomegranate juice, then slice up a whole apple, add some dried cranberries, goji berries or other dried fruit and set the rice cooker. 25 minutes later when the oatmeal is done, I add walnuts--and perhaps more fresh fruit if you like. The fruit juice is sweet enough not to need sugar or any other sweetener! It is truly like a very healthy dessert for breakfast!

review/summary: Hardy Morning Goodness!
review/text: I've always enjoyed oatmeal for breakfast, but when I purchased my Sanyo Rice Cooker, it had a porridge setting, so I bought McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal to try it out.  So much more flavorful than regular oatmeal!<br /><br />McCann's has rough cut bits of whole oats that cook into a hardy bowl of goodness that really stays with you through the morning.  Very satisfying.  I'll be keeping this on hand from now on!

review/summary: Wowee, Yum!!
review/text: This oatmeal is so delicious, and the texture is awesome.  The downside:  once you try this you'll never want that 'instant' oatmeal garbage ever again!  I have a small slowcooker:  I like to put in 1 cup of the oats and 4 cups of water, and then I put it on low to cook overnight. It's ready for me when I get up in the morning, and I have extra for later! For flavorings, I like to add a little salt, butter, cinnamon and sugar.<br /><br />What amazes me most is that it keeps me satisfied for so long.  With other oatmeals, I'd be hungry again within a couple of hours, or worse: still hungry when I finsh the bowl.  When I eat a bowl of this oatmeal, I'm good until lunch time, easily.<br /><br />And it's perfect winter comfort food!!

review/summary: Give it a chance, it grows on you
review/text: McCann's has a very different taste and texture than Quaker instant oats or other quick oat products, but it will grow on you.  It takes a few more minutes to make, so a little planning is required if you're an up & go kind of morning person, but it's worth it.  It's quite filling.  The tin cans are neat.  My first order arrived with one can popped-open and the oatmeal spilled into the box, but Amazon sent a new can, actually four new cans, at no charge.  And in many reorders I've never had that problem again.  Why shop anywhere else!

review/summary: Slow and inconvenient still the best...
review/text: I had been eating McCann's Quick & Easy (5-minute) oatmeal for some time, and it is really good.  I was mistakenly sent a batch of the traditional stuff (30 minutes), and I have to say it is quite a bit better.  So there you are.  I have found that by adjusting my routine it is not so difficult to give it the 30 minutes.  I won't be ordering the 5-minute stuff any more.  Highly recommended...

review/summary: True Porridge
review/text: McCann's Steel Cut oat meal is the best. With the steel cut you get a nuttier flavor. It's filling and the fiber in the steel cut doesn't cause that bloating gas feeling. It doesn't have the oat flakes you find in regular oatmeal and at first glance you'll wonder why they call it oatmeal, but this is the real thing.<br />Since you have to cook it for 30 minutes (enjoy the aroma)you can make a big batch ahead and just heat with milk as you need it. I cook a weeks worth and just take out my morning portion, add skim milk and microwave for two minutes. Add honey and you have the best porridge you'll ever taste. The price is right too. If it was good enough for the Chicago's World Fair in 1893 (Columbian Exposition), it's good enough for me.

review/summary: ALMOST AS EASY AS INSTANT OATS
review/text: Traditional oatmeal is an acquired taste which more people are acquiring because of the health benefit. McCann's is the easiest to find and to my taste the best.  (Quaker has put out a steelcut product which is not bad).<br /><br />The drawback is cooking, it takes a long time to cook.  My grandmother used to cook it in a doubleboiler overnight.<br /><br />There is an easy way.  The night before put 1/4 cup of oats to each cup of water in a saucepan, add salt, bring to a boil stirring occasionally. Turn off heat from anywhere from 30 to  90 seconds after reaching a boil, cover. In the morning  it is ready to eat, you can heat it in microwave or on the stove or eat it room temperature.

review/summary: Great Stuff
review/text: My 3-year old asks me to make this nearly every Saturday morning. We all love it. I have no problem with the 30-minute cooking time. Just start the pot of water boiling first thing after wandering into the kitchen. Do your usual other morning tasks while it cooks. Before you know it it, oatmeal is done.<br /><br />This porridge has been our little Saturday morning tradition for more than a year ever since we read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735814414">Good Morning, Little Fox</a> which involves a mom cooking porridge. Amazon's price for this item is much better than any of my local grocery stores' prices.<br /><br />We add a little milk and either brown sugar or fresh or dried fruit. It's summer now so we put slices of fresh ripe peaches in the bottom of the bowl before adding the hot oatmeal and a little milk. It does not have to be over-sweetened to make it taste good. I had no problems with the tins being shipped that was reported by several other reviewers.

review/text: I love this oatmeal for many reasons but the the best are the taste and the chew factor.  You really feel like you are eating a meal. I make a batch of this twice a week.  I cook it only 20 minutes and then I add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1&1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon stir and put a cover on it and let it sit for 15 minutes or so, off the heat, to finish.  This also helps so it doesn't stick to the pan.  No comparison to Quaker oats. So healthful and yummy.  I am on Weight Watchers and 1 cup of cooked oatmeal with 1/2 cup 1% milk, 1/8th oz. almonds (3 chopped), 2 dried apricots chopped, and 1 Tablespoon dried cranberries = 4 delicious filling points.

review/text: I generally like oatmeal. Did an Amazon search and came up with this product and bought some just to try.  This stuff is GREAT.  I tried the crock-pot overnite receipies as well as the stove top.  IMHO, the stove top method is by far the best.  If you like, add in some dried cranberries or raisins towards the end of the cooking process. I prefer mine serverd with a little brown sugar and some 2% milk.  BTW the leftovers hold up nicely and reheat well in the microwave.

review/summary: Tasty oatmeal
review/text: The flavor and texture of this oatmeal is different from rolled oats.  It's nuttier and the oats are still somewhat chewy after cooking.  I agree with the reviewer who likes both ... depending on the weather or mood.<br /><br />You do have to follow the directions on the can ... it takes about 35 -40 minutes on the stove.  It has to be watched at first so it doesn't boil over, but as others have said, it's worth the effort.  I've tried the microwave, but it doesn't work there because it boils over even on low setting in a very high dish.  Old fashioned rolled oats cook up swell in the m.w. - 3 minutes on high.<br /><br />Highly recommended!  The tin is terrific and will be useful for other treasures.

review/summary: Best Oatmeal I've Found
review/text: McCann's deffinatly deserves all of the awards it has won, plus it has adorable packaging.  That great tin is practacle too, most oatmeal comes in cardboard boxes that are easy for pantry pests to get into, but not this sturdy well sealing tin.<br /><br />If you are in a rush, this may not be the oatmeal for you, buy McCann's instant instead.  But if you have the stirring time deffinatly buy the original.  It takes a little while to cook, but it is evenly cut so it cooks evenly, unlike some of the other brands I've tried.  One of the things I love about this oatmeal is all the wonderfull ways you can flavor it.  To get you started there are basic cooking instructions on the can.  This oatmeal is healthier for you, it has a relatively low glycemic index, plus it has naturaly accuring protien, perfect for a carb junky like me.  Make a big batch and save some for reheating on mornings when you have less time.

review/summary: Delicious, nutritious and sooo good.
review/text: Homemakers on a tight budget, take note.<br />My little secrets for super, tasty and very economical breakfasts.<br />Take one egg, beat it well in a simple stainless bowl, thoroughly coat a portion (1 cup) of oatmeal. Using a large fry pan, with a little dab of earl, on medium to high heat, CONTINUOUSLY stir fry kernels until they are separate. Three to ten minutes, depending on the heat output of your stove.<br />To make it toothy, I add only a  tad over 3 cups of water. Ten minutes on the lowest heat (covered) and let it sit a few hours left to cool down. No point enriching the utility company and/or spoiling good food by making your fridge work past its capacity.<br />Important. Do not stir at all, period, basta, etc.<br />Having done so, creates a bit of a nice toothy textured meal.<br />Overnight in the icebox. Formula can be safely doubled for larger broods.<br />Garnish with maple syrup, honey, fruit etc. Use your imagination.<br />I generally stopped using white sugar almost 40 years ago. Although I am not an academic, and ain't gotten any degrees, empirically, it appears to me that white sugar avoidance does NOT kill you, it may even possibly be good for you. Use your good judgement and lead by example.<br />An exotic and excellent treat for children of all ages.<br />Heads and tails better than anything "Quaker".<br />BTW: This is the same way I prepare another of my favorite breakfast treats which should appeal to any good cook, namely , buckwheat (kasha).<br />A final comment, using Amazon auto reorder, this has to be one of the best and cheapest ways to provide a proper breakfast.<br />Enjoy and prosper.

review/summary: restaurant style oatmeal in your home
review/text: Our family began a search for this oatmeal after having it served at a lovely, popular hotel.  It was not until later that we all shared the fact that we loved it so much, but by then we were home.  Many phone calls later, we discovered the name, and found it on Amazon.<br />Now that we have begun to use it, there are so many ways to use it besides the typical boring sounding oatmeal. Try it in breads, make it for a healthy desert, fruit adds lovely touches and the creaminess is one of it's hot points. You can use any kind of milk, soybean milk and the wonderful tasting almond milk. Yes, for those of you demanding instant oatmeal, have at it.  But, it seems obvious McCann's is a healthier choice all around, so the extra time is worth it.  We make large batches at night, cool it and refrigerate it in tupperware for an easy breakfast to heat in the microwave.<br />There is the unique rich nutty flavor, very fresh tasting.  It is packaged in an attractive old fashioned can that I like as it is resistant to moths and pantry pests.  My husband uses the empty cans for all sorts of organizational projects in the garage.  Please give it a try, and then explore the way you like it best.

review/summary: The way oatmeal was meant to be: sensual, not pasty
review/text: You will look at instant oatmeal with scorn and disgust once you have enjoyed slow-cooked steel cut oats. There is nothing especially magical about the McCann version of this---you can get steel cut oats in bulk in practically any store that sells organic cereals and grains---but this brand remains my nostalgic favorite since I was introduced to these in childhood. Cooks beautifully in about 20 minutes without stirring or intervention of any kind if you use a double boiler.  Or better yet, load it into a programmable rice cooker the night before. The nutty, chewy texture is essential to the experience, and in that regard, the double boiler approach delivers a somewhat crunchier end result than my rice cooker, which creates a softer, more porridge-like oatmeal, due to the longer presoak and cooking time involved with the night-before approach.<br /><br />The cans keep quite a long time unopened---at least a year or two if the freshness dates are to be believed--- but I find the grains start to taste a littel stale or musty if you keep an open can more than a month or two.

review/text: I use my pressure cooker to make a huge pot of this in about 20 minutes. I use a half milk/half water mixture to cook, add some vanilla extract, bring it to a simmer, add the oats to the mix, and cover the pressure cooker. Let it go about 15 minutes, take it off the fire and let the pressure die down. I then take out the amount we are ready to eat that day and add raisins and a bit of equal, splenda or brown sugar-depending upon who is eating....YUMMM. I then put the rest in a giant container in the fridge, and each day of the week, I just have to microwave whatever we want to eat, add raisins and a bit of milk, something to sweeten it a bit and enjoy. Sometimes, I add fruit, cinnamon whatever I happen to have in the house ...A great way to start the day with very minimal cleanup and work on the busy weekdays.

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: I love the taste and the texture of these steel cut oats, but they can be somewhat of a labor of love to prepare.  It can take about 35 minutes to cook them from start to finish, with lots of stirring of the pot and keeping track of exactly how the heat is regulated on your stove.  I have made them the "long" way many times.  The taste is absolutely wonderful and the texture is quite pleasing.  I have also soaked the oats in water overnight and then cooked them the next morning which reduces the cooking time to about 10 minutes for me.  Still the same wonderful taste, but this method loses quite a lot of the whole grain sensation in the mouth.<br /><br />I was in the market for a rice cooker and while investigating them I noticed that some have a setting for porridge.  When I made my choice of the Panasonic SR-DE103 rice cooker it was partially because I wanted to use it to cook these oats.  The only drawback is that the rice cooker will only cook two servings at a time because the oats foam and bubble up so much during cooking.  Any more than two servings and they will be bubbling out of the steam vent of the cooker!  It also takes one hour to cook those two servings, but I can be off doing other things while the cooker takes care of the oats.  The oats cooked in the rice cooker have the same taste and texture as those cooked for the 35 minute method on the stove.<br /><br />This product is delightful.  I do add a tiny pinch of salt during the cooking time.  They are wonderful with either white sugar, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, butter, or just completely unadorned.  And, which is very important, a serving of these steel cut oats stick with me and I don't find myself wanting to eat a second breakfast two hours later.  One serving lasts until lunch time and beyond (if I'm really busy).  Any leftovers also keep well in a bowl in the refrigerator and warm up nicely in the microwave.  Just an all around great product.

review/summary: Cooking time
review/text: So, I've been a heavy user of this oatmeal.  I don't know how many would agree with me, but I find a 30 min cooking time unnecessary.  I cook it on the stovetop for 17-18 min after coming to a boil.  It is done.  But you have to use a bit less water too - use about 3x water instead of 4x.<br /><br />I really like the extra texture that this short cooking provides.  If you find it a bit hard at first, leave it stading for a couple of minutes and it will soften more.  Ever since I've found I don't have to spend 30 minutes to obtain great taste, it saved so much time!  Try it!<br /><br />Unrelatedely, the price on Amazon has not become competitive enough to order 4 cans, even with the 15% discount.  WF have lowered their prices and I now buy it there.

review/summary: "new" oatmeal gotr hungry Hoosiers
review/text: We have loved Quaker Oats for years and years, and will not cast any negative words bout it.  Always ready to try something new, we ordered the McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal and are not disappointed. The oatmeal has wonderful flavor, is mouth-satisfyingly chewy, and like the old friend Quaker Oats, sticks to the ribs.  You can't rush it ... it takes a good 30 minutes to cook, but it is worth the wait.  Read the contatiner for a short cut.  We've since cut the recipe in half giving just enough for the both of us.  (the full recipe is four servings)  A hearty recommendation for this project.

review/summary: Delicious, healthy, easy to prepare, versatile
review/text: After many years of eating Quaker Oats, I purchased McCann's and haven't looked back. I didn't know such a modest dish could taste so incredibly good. On Sunday nights I use the short cut method (on the side of the can)which requires one minute of cooking and then storage in the fridge until the following morning. I cook a medium pot which lasts us all week. Just heat them up for about 10 minutes on low (or microwave on medium high) and you have the best oatmeal on the planet. I frequently charge it up with dried cranberries, fresh frozen blueberries, strawberries, chunks of apple and cinnamon and even chopped nuts, sunflower seeds and ground flax seeds. This oatmeal is not mushy but neither is it hard. The texture is chewy and the flavor is awesome. My husband and I are hooked and keep our cupboard well stocked with this healthy breakfast food. We even eat it as a light snack at night with a bit of maple syrup when we crave something sweet. For anyone who loves oatmeal, this is the one to try.

review/text: If you're an oatmeal love, you owe it to yourself to try Steel Cut oatmeal. McCann's is an excellent choice. It comes in air-tight cans that keeps everything fresh. You can make regular oatmeal or porridge. This stuff even tastes good without embellishments like milk, fruit or honey. Great choice!

review/text: I bought this on a lightning deal sale at Amazon.<br /><br />I normally don't spend more than 15 minutes preparing breakfast but cooking this oatmeal for 30 minutes is well worth it.  I love the texture and flavor and this is much better than the Quaker Oats you buy at Vons or Ralphs. I don't add any salt or honey in my oatmeal. I eat it plain and I love it.

review/text: The only real downside is that you have to plan ahead.  It has to cook for about 30 min. Its has a harty texture, it does not taste anything like the typical oatmeal that I have found in stores., really good. I eat this oatmeal almost every morning for my breakfast. This is the BEST Oatmeal I ever Tried. Absolutely yummy. I cook my oatmeal according to the direction, listed on the can, You make it with 4 cups of water, bring to a boil and 1 cup of oatmeal. When I added the oatmeal to the boiling water, you stir, let get a bit  thick, than I place a lid on the pot of oatmeal to steam it for a while longer.

review/summary: Great Oatmeal Takes Time
review/text: We are very pleased to be able to purchase this online as our local store has closed due to the economy. Though it takes a tad longer to cook than conventional oatmeals it is well worth the time. The taste is superior and the health benefits out way everything. We just cook up twice as much as we want for the week and then portion it out in the morning. We keep what isn't eaten in a container in the frige. It is just as tasty on the last day as it is on the day it was cooked. Reheating is a breeze in the microwave.

review/summary: Great product, cook in a rice cooker on porridge setting
review/text: I eat this every day, and cook it in an induction rice cooker so that it comes out perfect with no worry about timing...can even set to be ready at a time in the morning. Adding frozen fruit of any type towards the end of the cycle is all you need for sweetness..Cherries, blueberries, mangoes..whatever and raisins are good too. I find the price varies greatly by retail store, but whole foods sells it for 4.99 every day which is less than here on Amazon unless you get the repeat delivery cycle. Life changing breakfast!

It was always the coolest gum to buy as a kid because it came in unique little sacks with drawstrings.<br /><br />Well, good news, retro candy lovers! It is still here. This is an enormous and heavy box full of 24 satchels of Gold Mine gum. Not only is it still fun, it's still delicious. It's relatively expensive for gum, but for an occasional treat or to introduce it to a new generation, I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Fun drink, but expensive
review/text: The taste instantly reminded me of my last cruise, sitting on the pool deck and drinking a fruity alcoholic "drink of the day".  Basically, it tastes good and is not hard to get down or anything like that.  The first time I tried it like a shooter, literally shooting the whole thing.  That was a mistake, I think it is better to just sip it three to four times instead.<br /><br />As for the energy boost, I think the 1-shot a day idea isn't going to do much to boost your energy level. But if you take three or four of them a day, then yes I can see it giving you a boost.  Unfortunately you also need to apply for a bank loan to be able to afford it.

review/summary: Jumpstart your Day
review/text: I am a big Jamba Juice fan. For someone on the go, I get my energy anyway I can. Therefore, when I saw this, I instantly thought of the "boosters" they add into my smoothies and how great it would be to have this at home, in a single "shot," even. I had never heard of Cupuacu but I do love mangoes. I thought whatever it tastes like, it cannot be that bad. I was pleasantly surprised at the sweet taste. In fact it almost syrup like so if you don't like something that is too sweet you can mix it into some juice or a smoothie. 1 fl. oz is all that you need for the serving size. After drinking it for a few days on and off, I could tell the difference between the days that I took it and the days that I did not. It gave me energy, it reduced my nasal congestion, and made a little more bright-eyed in the morning. I will definitely be buying this again. It gives me a little shot of caffeine but also B-vitamins for lasting energy. Would recommend.

review/text: I'm not one to imbibe things that I can't pronounce, because they're usually made with lots of artificial chemical ingredients -- but this "Cupuacu" is merely a Portuguese word for an antioxidant-rich Brazilian fruit.  For vitality and endurance, I pronounce it a success!<br /><br />It provides a natural boost like chocolate (40mg caffeine), but it tastes like a combo of coconut, mango and tangy tropical fruits.  A shot a day gives you 100% daily value of B6 and B12, yet has only 20 calories.

review/summary: Unique delicuous taste
review/text: I opened my first bottle, and poured an ounce into the included "shot glass".  It is thick and a murky color.  I wasn't sure what to think, but it smelled ok, so I took a sip.  It was so different, definitely manogo-y, but also had another flavor I couldn't place.  Then it came to me, it tasted a bit like chocolate.  When I read the label, it said that cupuacu is a "cousin" of chocolate, so that explains it!  If it wasn't so expensive, I would have poured a glass and added a few ice cubes.  I have been drinking my little shot in the middle of the afternoon for a little pickup, due to natural caffeine and for a little sweet treat.  This drink supplies antioxidants as well as 100% of vitamins B6 and B12 with nothing artificial and no added sugar, a great product!
