review/summary: Great taste - poor packaging wastes k-cups
review/text: I love the taste of this coffee.  But apparently they have poor quality control.  These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly.  You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to.  Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem.<br /><br />It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens.<br /><br />I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them.<br /><br />Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing.

review/summary: the best of the best
review/text: My husband and I are crazy about Coffee People k-cups.  A friend gave us a box of the "Donut Shop" cups and they are spectacular.  Very rich and bold, not bitter, but packs a nice punch.  Reminds me of coffee from an old-fashioned percolator.  A good, strong cup of coffee is hard to come by when you are using some of these newer brewing machines, but the Keurig system is definitely the exception and this variety of k-cup is the best we have ever tasted.

review/summary: A perfect "Anytime" coffee that is sure to please.
review/text: I have tried many, many brands and blends in my Keurig coffee maker and this is definetely one of my favorites.  The type of coffe I drink depends on my mood.  Sometimes I want a strong, bold cup like, Newman's Own Extra-bold Special Blend K-cups, 80 Pk for Keurig Brewers and sometimes I want something more mild like, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NP30XQ">Green Mountain K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108-ct.- Nantucket Blend</a>  But ever since I have had my Keurig I have been looking for one of my favorite coffees.  The Dunkin Donut brand.<br /><br />This coffee is superb and very much like the Dunkin Donut brand.  Not bold or bitter.  Not weak or under flavored.  It is smooth and very flavorful.  It is the perfect crowd pleasing blend for any time of day or night.<br /><br />I have shopped all over and you can't beat the variety or the price here on Amazon when you join their club.  A great value.<br /><br />I do wish that Amazon would change the name by removing "Extra Bold".  It is not.  It is, at most, a medium roast.  Even when brewed with the smallest setting of the Keurig I would not concider it bold.  It comes out great on the medium size setting.  Very remanicent of that great cup of Joe you would get in the old days at your favorite diner.

review/text: This coffee is exactly what you would get at a coffee shop. Sweet and aromatic, not bitter or too bold. I like the pack of 50 and it comes in one box, so there is no waste of packaging or more trash to throw away. If they only made a box of with 100... We love the K-Cups and get great consistent coffee every day without wasting half a pot. My favs are Timothy's German Chocolate (desert coffee!), Donut Shop (mid Morning) and Emeril's Big Bold Easy (first thing in the morning!).

review/summary: Quality control needed ASAP!
review/text: Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control.  I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each.  In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in.  Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.  I hope the folk at Coffee People can rectify this situation, as this is my favorite coffee, but I will not order this product again without some resolve on their side.

(I was expecting it to be red or purple..)<br />also, it tastes kind of like green apple!!

This does not have a sugared up sweetness that most other sodas have.<br /><br />This would be a special drink on those days we would BBQ or have a family dinner. Nowadays it continues to be enjoyed on occasion as well, as it unfortunately doesn't fit my daily diet. While it does not contain High Fructose Corn Syrup (a huge plus in the world of sodas!), it does still contain sugar/carbs.

review/text: I don't know why Science Diet is being referred to as junk food, as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market. A lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be. But regardless, my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine. After some comparisons, Science Diet Mature Adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food. Both my cats, the younger one and the older (10) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it. They both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them. My younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy :)

review/summary: The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?
review/text: I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Kitty Junk Food
review/text: We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.

review/summary: Not minced, this is ground beef
review/text: Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef.  My cat ONLY likes minced.  Not chunks, not ground.  Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.<br /><br />I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.  The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all.

review/summary: Not minced
review/text: I ordered this because it is Science Diet and it says it is minced. Well, it is NOT minced and my cats do not like it. It is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they can't eat it. I am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too. Will not be buying it again. Returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so I would be losing money.

review/summary: Kitty Junk Food
review/text: We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: All By-Product & Corn -- Don't Waste Your Money!
review/text: I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: So far, pretty good for cockroaches!
review/text: Well, I wanted to try a "multi-use" option, one that didn't seem so dangerous for in-and-around home use.  I put this down to start with in a few places in the garage as I started to clean up the area, then called it quits for the day. The very next day I had two large dead dudes not more than a few feet from where I had spread this - and I had only put it down in 2-3 areas by one wall.  I was impressed.  My only hesitation (and why I have not given it 5 stars) is that the roaches were so close to the bait that I wonder if it killed them so quickly it never got back into the nest.  If so, that is a powerful bait, but I am not sure if it is the best option if you have to get the guys one-by-one. Still, very fast and very easy to use.  Sort of like spreading a coarse grain - very little odor, shakes out of the can well enough. I'm pleased for now.

Don't use in areas you have recently sprayed as this will prevent reaches from getting to it and bringing it back to the nest for others tio feed on.

review/text: I just love Knorr Hunter Schnitzel Mix.  I find it very hard to find in grocery stores. The pork cutlets you make with it are also a little hard to find, but on the West Coast Trader Joe's has them.  If people knew what schnitzel really is, and how easy it is to make fabulous schnitzel with this mix, I'm sure every store would carry it in their foreign foods section.  It's especially good for days when you are pressed for time, or dead beat and you want to make an extra good meal, or if you have company coming.  I like to serve it with a little spaetzle, though the more authentic way is with roasted potatoes and a little Rot Kohl.  Now if I could only find some great ready-made spaetzle for those busy days.  The instructions are in German, which is not really that hard to read, but if you need help, Google translate does a fine job.  There is an American version of this mix, but I don't live in Pennsylvania, so I was delighted to be able to get it quick and fresh over the internet.

review/text: So i got this here turkish delight box. These are in my opinion a step away from your average turkish delight (not that i am a seasoned T.D.consumer) but they are more than anything just too soft...just like winegum even though they are much easier to chew up if you will, and therefore reminiscent of eating plain candy even though they have a very good quality consitency and taste. These come largely without any nuts inside..maybe the odd bite though. But the sugar coating is excessive and may upset your tummy. Don`t eat to many of these at any one time. YE BE WARNED! I think i would try to open them up and maybe let them sit a few days to become dry?? (more chewing resistance) Even maybe try to get wrid of some of that sugar coating?! Anyway i like the way the box opens. Side opening with a nice drawout feature and neatly wrapped in a thin plastic foil. So basically these come plain, with the odd bite with some nuts inside. Not my favourite. Too little fibre maybe?

I never knew you could get cornstarch to form a gummy--not just chewy--consistency.<br /><br />The flavors were all good: lemon, rose, mint, and nut (seemed primarily hazelnut for me).  There was no lemon-rose or plain in my box.  The powdered sugar was a bit messy while eating, and although it would be inauthentic, I would have rather had the gels covered with chocolate or fondant.  It was a little on the saccharine side for my preference, but overall quite delectable.  I'd consider buying from this supplier again, especially their rose-flavored ones.

I make Japanese curry 1-2 times a month, buying a package of 10 is great especially I'm saving about $1 compared to local grocery store per package.<br /><br />In case you don't know how to use this: Add 4 cups of water and bring to boil, add your favorite meat (I usually use beef), your favorite veggie, traditionally we use onions, carrots, mushroom and white potato, cook until meat is tender, then you add the entire package but make sure to break into pieces and drop into this stew, and gently mix with a wooden spoon, until curry is melted all the way through, it should be thick like melted chocolate, you can add some butter if you like. As for rice, steam medium or short grain rice, after it's cooked, add finely chopped raw onion (1/2 - 1 cup) and a 2 table spoon of butter and mix well. On a plate add rice and pour curry over it, mmmmmm, it's going to be curry tonight!

I actually bought the single box not the ten pack and I would recommend you do the same if you want to try this stuff. What you get in each box is two blocks of something like chocolate in individually sealed packs with instructions on the back for using both at once. My biggest complaint with the product is that it was not hot at all in fact the predominant flavor was MSG. There _was_ a complex undertone that might have been pleasant had not the blaring MSG main note been so overpowering. I wound up throwing away most of it after staring down the leftovers in the fridge for a week.

Amazon has these at a great price versus what my local grocery store charges, so I went ahead and ordered a box of the Sour Cream and Onion flavor.  They're good, but I must admit I think the original flavor is better.  I'm surprised as I'm a flavored chip junkie!  However, the sour cream and onion flavor seems to lack salt and I noticed most of the powder flavoring ends up in the bottom of the bag.  Don't get me wrong, they're good--I just prefer the original flavor.

They added rice, took away certain seasonings, and added a DISGUSTING tasting ACID. It tastes like im eating a LEMON. This tastes like a completely different snack - I dont buy it anymore. WHY OH WHY DID THEY CHANGE THE RECIPE. GOD HELP US.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />These krinkle sticks are the best baked low fat snack EVER. NO QUESTION. They have a great crunch and a HUGE SERVING SIZE!!!! You would have no idea they are so low in fat! They are seasoned to perfection. Sometimes the seasoning can settle to the bottom a bit and the sticks near the bottom are seasoned more (MORE FLAVOR NOM NOM NOM NOM). They are baked, not oily, but still taste awesome.<br /><br />You HAVE to try these. I prefer the regular sea salt flavor.

review/summary: A true carb-craving life saver!
review/text: In my never ending quest for lo-cal yet tasty snacks, I happened on these potato sticks at Fresh Market. The fact that a serving is a whopping 40 sticks for 110 calories and (wait for this) a mere 20 calories of fat intrigued me. I figured the sticks would be mini-sticks....but NO! They're a generous size and, better yet, are crispy and delicious! They're lightly salted with sea salt so you don't feel like you're sacrificing anything! I was quickly addicted. Unfortunately, Fresh Market isn't exactly around the corner, and I could find no other stores in the area that carry them. Amazon to the rescue! The price was better and the speed of delivery is...WOW! They also sell them in individual bags. I highly recommend these snacks for fellow carbaholics!

OK Amazon take note that to keep customers you need to add expiration dates to all food products advertised and let the people decide if they want it or not.

review/text: This is the best sweet chili garlic sauce I've ever had.  The product description here on amazon makes no sense.  Here's what you need to know:<br /><br />1) it tastes great.  I just ate a potato purely as an excuse for putting this sauce on it.<br />2) it's made in Thailand<br />3) it's garlicky, spicy, and sweet, but not too much in any direction.  well, maybe a little on the sweet side.<br /><br />The distributor is based in California, so this sauce may be hard to find outside of local specialty stores (which is where I got it) or online.  However, having tried it, I would just cough up the shipping because it's a masterpiece.

It is hands-down the best ingrediant for creamy Italian dressing, spaghetti sauce, marinade, Bloody Marys and everything that you can think of that needs absolutely perfect seasoning. There's no need to keep adding salt, other spices, herbs, oils, sugar, vinegar - NOTHING!  I was pretty devastated when I could no longer find Viva at any grocery store and equally delighted when I did find it on Amazon!

This stuff tastes aweful but I'm well aware it's a medicinal herb.<br /><br />I can't give less ratings because of taste - that wouldn't be fair. Just be prepared for something very bitter, suck it up, and use it for the health benefits it offers.<br /><br />I also can't give this 5 stars because the zip-lock bag it came in was cheap and it took a very long time to ship. Shipping was way too expensive too. Being a prime member, I guess I've been spoiled.<br /><br />Be sure to try a little first to make sure you'll be OK with it too. Other than that, it was harmless.

With only 2 grams of fiber, they are not considered high-fiber, but what a tasty way to start the day!  Good price for the 60-bar pack from Toy Ranch at the time I purchased and super-fast shipping with Amazon Prime!

review/summary: The "Original" is the Better Choice. The garlic/lime variants are a bit heavy handed and don't match the quality of the Original
review/text: I much prefer the original Cholula hot sauce. This variant adds a heavy dose of lime to what was and is a good hot sauce.  Buy the original hot sauce and if you want to add some lime -- then add it yourself. At the very least, then you can control the amount of lime added.<br /><br />The original Cholula hot sauce was and is quite successful and for good reason -- it is really tasty. Unfortunately some marketing "genius" came up with a lime and garlic version of the original sauce. In both cases ---  the lime or garlic versions are so heavy handed that they obscure the finer nature of the underlying sauce.<br /><br />Try the original version before even considering these heavy handed variants.<br /><br />PS: Watch out for high shipping charges that do not decrease even if you are purchasing multiple bottles at the same time! Review the final shipping charges before you check out here on Amazon. They may be much higher than you where lead to believe. Some companies on Amazon attempt to profit by offering very low prices combined with very high shipping charges. Buyer be aware!

review/summary: The Best Chili Lime Sauce In A Bottle
review/text: This Cholula chili lime sauce is the best chili lime hot sauce that comes packaged in a bottle. Some of the reviews have given it a lower rating because it doesn't taste good on EVERYTHING. You can't really expect one type of hot sauce to be the solution to all your bland tasting food. If you use this hot sauce wisely it will become one of your favorite ingredients. Another review pointed out that this sauce tasted best on chips, I couldn't agree more. People who are using this on their tacos don't know how to eat tacos, and shouldn't be using bottled hot sauce to begin with. So if you love lime and Cholula original then you will enjoy this Cholula Chili Lime sauce. Give it a try and experiment, I assure you that you will find a use for it and become addicted to it in the process. My only complaint is that I can't find anything bigger than a 5 oz bottle, but luckily there's a 5 oz. 12 pack option I can resort to.

review/text: Tucked in between the main island of Scotland and Islay, Jura is a mysterious island distillery that produces a fine line of expressions. I like the Superstition most as it is most accessible in the US.  It is an orangy, peaty, smokey, biscuity, nutty affair with a touch a vanilla, salt, and a waft of smoke on the medium length finish. Not quite as balanced and refined as I like and the E150a creates a bit of a chalky caramel texture, thus the couple of star hit from me. A fine expression nonetheless and very affordable. Well worth trying as an introduction to some of its famous neighbors on Islay.

review/summary: Poor customer service
review/text: I ordered some xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very, very strange, foul smell. Kinda like mothballs. They get some of their products made in China (the erythritol, apparently), so I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination. I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund just for the strange smelling items (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable). She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again. Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one of the same thing since I'd never ordered from them before. (Note: I only wanted a refund for the unopened bags of the item in question. I did not ask to return anything else in the order.)<br /><br />I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same. Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site. While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me.<br /><br />I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc. Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried. I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective.<br /><br />NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar. They are also available here on Amazon.com.<br />Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />-I ordered a wide variety of things, including this item: erythritol, xylitol, gum, candy, etc. It included this item and a lot of other things.<br />-I asked only for money back on items I tried that were suspect as being defective, and then only for the items I had not opened.<br />-I asked the manufacturer if the items were safe to consume, given the very odd odor some of them emitted.<br /><br />-My review concerns primarily the customer service problems I had, as well as the concern with the origin of their products I had ordered in general.<br /><br />Personally I think it is odd that when I called to return a small part of a rather large order that the customer service rep did not want to honor the guaranteed refund posted on the web site. She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing. How was I to know the substance would smell so badly? She said I should have just ordered one. What difference does it make since I had only opened one? The others were perfectly sealed. She said she would take them back after much ado, and then said they would never accept another order from me. (Like I would anyway after that).<br /><br />I stand by my post. If you have had a good encounter with their customer service, I am happy for you. That was not my experience. They should not post a guaranteed refund when they don't mean it.

review/summary: Great alternative to sugar
review/text: I discovered Xylitol by accident and will never go back to using sugar in anything I make or drink. I use it in coffee, tea and it is used exactly like sugar in baking and even sprinkling over fresh strawberries. A plus is that studies have shown it is actually good for your teeth and bones, as well as having a very low glycemic-index value, so it is even great for diabetics. This is a natural product, not like the chemical concoctions currently being sold as artificial sweeteners.

review/summary: Doesn't taste that great
review/text: I decided to try Xylitol since I've been using Spenda for a few years and heard this sweetner was better. I was really disappointed. It's not nearly as sweet as Splenda and you have to use a ton more of it to get the same sweetness.  I also didn't care for the strange taste.

review/text: I have used Emerald Forest Xylitol Sweetener from these packets and from the 2 lb. cans from Amazon for six months and it tastes and smells just fine to me.  No "foul smell" whatsoever--in fact, it smells sweet to my proboscis. I have purchased other brands in the past and this product is identical to them if not better, as far as I am concerned.

review/summary: Worth the price, even if for the entertainment value alone!
review/text: I am a self professed chili-head and this is my take on this assortment of fine pepper sauces.  I came home from work on a Friday evening and was delighted to find that this package had arrived.  I immediately opened the carton and grabbed a sleeve of saltine crackers, so I started the ultimate taste test.  One by one I tried a few drops of each sprinkled on top of a cracker.  Well just after finishing number six (Dave's Ghost Pepper), the wife arrived, walking into the kitchen she looked at me and asked "Why are you crying?" I replied "I can't help it! The world is so cruel !".<br />In my opinion the best tasting sauces in this assortment are Blair's and Mad Dog 357.  Blair's is probably the mildest in terms of heat and has a sweet almost tomato like flavor.  Mad Dog, a very hot sauce with smoky BBQ type flavor is probably my favorite.  All of these sauces have decent flavor, but with the exception of Mad Dog, the hottest sauces tend to end with a metallic after taste.<br /><br />Absolutely, and without any doubt Dave's Ghost is the hottest of all in this selection.  Although it has a good flavor, it's usefulness is questionable.  I am unable to add enough quantity of it to a dish to impact flavor without raising the heat to almost intolerable levels.<br />This stuff is extremely hot!!

review/summary: Now lower price - but same great quality!
review/text: I love these little tomatoes. They are a specialty from southern Italy, growing at the foot of the Vesuvio. When you taste them, you actually feel little taste explosions in your mouth! Crazy? No, not at all, you must try this for yourself!<br /><br />These little tomatoes are best used as a simple (simple!) companion for outstanding pasta (for example Bucatini By Pastificio Faella From Gragnano, or Maccheroni by Martelli, Toscana, or Latini Spaghetti Chitarra 1.1lb) by just sweating 2 or 3 cloves of fresh garlic in evo oil, than adding these tomatoes with a pinch of salt on MILD heat and gently heat them up, then add to prepared pasta. You can add a good pesto or fresh basil to taste, if you like. The experience will be otherwordly!<br /><br />I had tried them first in 2009, that is how I know the price difference. At that time the small jar (520g) was 22.50$, and I found that a bit steap. But now they offer 2 sizes, and now you get a kilo (1000g) for 25.50, respective the small jar for 14.00$. Now I have tested the product again, because I was suspicious about that. Would that be a lesser quality, now with the lower price? No, not at all, it is really the same great item. Maybe the higher price had to with a lesser harvest back then? I have no idea, but I love love love these tomatoes.<br /><br />I have seen videos on youtube about fancy restaurants in New York City putting them on their fancy pizza. I can't travel there, but I can get the ingredients delivered to my kitchen!

review/text: They have a creamy, rich (but not overpowering) hazelnut flavor with a crunch from the nut placed at the top of the chocolate. I like that each one is individually wrapped, making it less messy and fresher. This is one of my favorite chocolates and I find that the "love notes" included between the foil wrapping and the chocolate add a nice touch.

review/summary: Excellent taste
review/text: Simply put, this tea is delicious.  The mango taste is smooth and not overwhelming and all the ingredients are blended well so nothing is overpowering.  I also like the fact that Numi did not pump tons of sugar into the tea to make it overly sweet, thereby cutting down on calories, carbs, and sugar.  As the label indicates, this is 'barely sweetened' but it tastes just right.  There are also little 'gems' of wisdom underneath the bottle caps.  I can't wait to try every flavor in this line of Puerh teas in the glass bottle.  I did not order the tea through Amazon, rather I got it directly through the Numi tea website, but wanted to give a review here for others.

review/summary: Dilmah Tea is Delicious!
review/text: Thank you Amazon, for selling this wonderful tea. I first tried it in Fiji, some 5 years ago. I was hooked from the first sip! The flavor is rich, the color is dark -  definately pure Ceylon. I was unable to find Dilmah tea in the States, so I had to order directly from the manufacturer, in Sri Lanka. It was a fine experience, except I had to remember to notify my credit card that there would be an international charge, or they would decline the transaction, thus making me wait even longer for my precious tea. It is very reasonable to purchase directly via Amazon! Thank you.

review/text: I am from new Zealand and they have this tea in all the grocery stores over there, I loved it when lived thee and missed it when I moved to the USA.  I ran out of my stash from my last trip home and was bummed.  I was thrilled when I took a chance and looked to see if amazon selled it and they do! I love the taste, it is better than any tea we have in the USA and they other thing I love is that they are not individually wrapped which is not wasting paper and extra packaging.  They do not have strings and that may bother  some, but I like it better as you can compost them or put them right down the waste disposal.<br /><br />Def give this tea a try if you are a tea drinker, it's the best!
