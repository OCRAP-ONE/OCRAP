review/text: These work best as refills for the Busy Buddy Bouncy Bone, so if your dog likes the Bone these work great as refills for the chewy part of the toy. My Boxers don't really play with the Bouncy Bone, so I gave these to them as a treat and they love them-altgough they eat them in seconds and so aren't very ecomical!

review/summary: Dog-gone It, It's Worth It!
review/text: My dog is the brainiac type.  No stuffed animals or balls for him.  He'd rather take apart a plastic bottle or a remote control.  I knew I'd have a hit on this toy and I sure do!  He's built up his speed to get the rawhide rings off the spools, but he's still interested in it and can't wait until I reload it.  Just be sure to remember which size toy you purchase...I accidently bought the wrong size replacement rings.  Luckily, they work at all sizes, but the treat after all the effort on his part is not the same.  Better than a Kong, which I'll probably be donating to the shelter dogs who would settle for less.

review/text: These Premier treats are made for the Buddy Bouncy Bone. We call them the pepperonis and my puppy gets one on the Bouncy Bone every night before bed to calm him done a bit and he just loves them!! In fact after two nights he really started craving them before bed and asks to get down to our bedroom not to sleep but for his pepperoni!!<br /><br />Doing two at at time can be expensive but one on one side to the bone is just right!!

review/summary: Delicious chutney!
review/text: I am a big fan of Patak's Indian food products.  This chutney is delicious and very much like major grey's chutney, only with a bit of a kick to it.  I would say "hot" is an exaggeration.  It is more flavorful, and just a little bit spicy.  My husband, who does not like very hot food, is able to enjoy it.  It has certainly enhanced every type of curry dish we have served it with.

I also like the fact that the small cans allow you to have that fresh fizzy sparkle every time, not like the last half of a liter bottle.  Free delivery is a big plus!<br /><br />I love Tito's premium vodka from Austin, TX mixed with Hansen's and a wee bit of Manhattan's key lime juice (available here) over very clean ice like Arctic Glacier.  Try it - you'll be commenting favorably on this review!  Very clen, crisp and refreshing in moderation.

review/summary: A Top Garden Radish
review/text: French Breakfast radishes are a real garden treat.  I plant them every year and am rewarded with fresh radishes from the garden each spring.  This is an early spring crop, so plant as soon as the frosts are over.  I plant a row each week for 4 weeks to get a continual supply of radishes.  French Breakfast radishes have a red body with white tips.  They are about 3-4" long and take about 28 days to mature.  Do not leave them in much longer than this or they will get pithy (hollow).  Water regularly to ensure even growth and prevent spliting.  These are easy to grow and very mild and tasty.  They are generally not a "hot" radish.  Fine for eating whole or slicing on salads. Grubs tend to enjoy these radishes, so you may want to consider a grub killer before planting.<br /><br />konedog

review/text: I bought this because it was on sale and I was on a diet but NEEDED a chips fix.  It worked perfectly!  The serving size is around 17 chips but I eat about half of that with a spinach-yogurt dip for a high protein midday snack.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a snack high in protein but keep in mind it is a bit salty.  The crisps are not crispy- it's more of a rice cake consistency.

review/text: Manufacturer Luck Chen has shuttered the facilities that produced this product due to quality concerns in China.  Beware of products that feature $40 savings... Especially if it is a food product.<br /><br />EDIT 12/17/2011<br />Due to my concerns, I phoned Luck Chen and spoke at length about my apprehensions.  The noodles Luck Chen LLC produced were manufactured in China.  The MannaSoy product is manufactured in Israel.  My over critical mind assumed that because on Luck Chen's website (the LLC that is at the 'top' of the business structure, at least as product description reads "Manufacturer: Luck Chen') then I felt all products under that name would be suspect of quality as well.  My concerns were fostered by lack of distinction on either Luck Chen's or Manna Soy's websites detailing the different countries of manufacture and lack of highlighting this applies solely to the noodle bowls; the Luck Chen representative said he hadn't considered how that may play out in a customer's mind and said he would work on clearing up that distinction on the websites.<br /><br />I now feel confident in ordering some of the MannaSoy product and giving it a spin in my wok.  Hopefully if anyone should have concerns similar to my initial ones, they will be rested by my experience and Luck Chen's explanation to me.<br /><br />Thanks to Daniel D. STEIN-FREER for challenging my initial comment.

review/text: I gave this five stars because it is an overall a great meat substitute. However, because it is supposed to be faux meat I felt they overseasoned this product( but its not salty). If you do not like curry chicken DO NOT PURCHASE. You will have to use this in a chicken curry dish, maybe a sweet and sour dish would be a good dish to lower the curry flavor, but its still there. I love the texture, this could very well be mistaken for real meat. I love it!!

review/summary: Tasty, versaile and easy
review/text: I like this because it can be stored on the shelf for long periods, a good way to always have some protein on hand. Once opened, it lasts up to 5 days in the fridge. It can also be frozen for a 2-3 months. The texture is good, firm and chewy, but not tough. A 2 ounce serving has 63 calories, 9 g protein, 3 g fat, 1 g carbohydrate, 4 g fiber, and 367 mg sodium. The package has 63 (2 ounce) servings.<br /><br />The curry flavor is mild but tasty. It's not hot, has little or no chili, tastes mostly of turmeric, with a little cumin (another reviewer called it a "strong" curry flavor, so reactions will vary). It has a bit too much salt for me. This dish could be improved by allowing those who want it to add salt on their own. It's better with rice, veggies, etc., than eaten alone. If mixed in with unsalted foods, the salt can be balanced.<br /><br />This is a good value, it's better than OK. Rounding up to 5, I'd give it 4.5 stars, detracting only because of the salt. Worth a try, especially for vegetarians and vegans who want pantry stock.

review/summary: Finally!  A quality meat alternative at a fair price!
review/text: I was skeptical about ordering this product due to the extremely reasonable price per pound compared to most other meat alternatives.  I was concerned that the stated 4.4 lb. product weight would be composed mostly of liquid.  But, the shipping rate was very reasonable, so thought I'd give it a try.  After recieving the product (extremely fast shipping) I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the product texture, density and ease of handling (the size of the "chicken" strips is perfect for most recipes).  The heavy, sealed bags were crammed with product with just a little broth to keep moist.  I have not yet tried it in a recipe but just popped a couple of the heated strips in my mouth and they have a mild curry flavor - I can't stand the over-salted, over-seasoned products of many manufacturers.  The meaty, but not rubbery, texture should lend themselves well to using in an endless variety of dishes - even cold over salads.  I will definitely order this product and others in the Manna Soy line in the future.  Oh yes, the company even included a bunch of recipes!

review/summary: pretty good, but not what I hoped
review/text: Campbell's Chunky Beef with Country Vegetables (BCV) is my favorite, but this was such a good deal on subscribe and save that I decided to try it as an alternative. It has a thinner broth than BCV, LOTS of rice with a few veggies (and a few pieces of beef of course), and a little bit of a kick in the flavor. It's okay--I'll be finishing all the cans--but every time I open one I wish I just bought BCV instead.<br /><br />A note about Campbell's Chunky soups in general... they all have their names "mixed up" and you should swap what is before and after the "with" in the name to know what to expect in the can (e.g., BCV is really more like "Country Vegetables with Beef"). That said, I still prefer Campbell's Chunky soups to any other brand. And... this flavor is pretty good, as long as you like rice and you're not trying to substitute it for BCV.

review/summary: The BEST alcoholic eggnog ever!!!
review/text: We live in PA, and we tried this for the first time last year.  I couldn't wait to get some this year so my brothers and their families could try it!  They ALL could not believe how great it was, and especially how we didn't have to add ANY liquor to it to make it taste like good old fashioned eggnog like my brothers and I remembered when we were young!!!  Needless to say they all said this is the eggnog they will buy fromm now on!!!!!  I just hope and pray we can continue to get in PA, cause all of our liquor stores are owned by the State of PA and from year to year you never know what items will be sold in our illustrious State "Wine and Spirits" stores!!!

review/summary: Great Cat Food!
review/text: This cat food is great.  There is no grain and it's natural.  Also, my cats love it.  My cats are fed a variety of cat foods, never the same food day in day out; would you like to eat the same thing everyday?  This is one of their favorites.  They like food that is chunky or shredded, like real meat, and do not like any of the pate style foods that are so popular.  I would recommend this food for people looking for healthy cat food.

review/summary: Great cat food
review/text: My old cat who died last year had diabetes because I didn't understand the basic principles of feline nutrition.  After he was diagnosed, I switched him to a canned food diet with multiple small feedings per day, and that was actually enough to get him off insulin!<br /><br />Although I would have done anything to prevent his diabetes, I didn't appreciate how unfussy it made him until he died and I got another cat.  The old cat would eat anything.  The new cat would starve himself to death before he'd eat something that doesn't meet his standards.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's particularly fussy about canned food.  He doesn't like pate-style or ground foods - if I even want there to be a prayer of him eating it, it has to have shredded meat.  That's why I was so pleased to discover this brand.<br /><br />First of all, I love the ingredient list.  The foods are balanced and grain-free (so important!) and don't contain unnecessary chemicals or preservatives.  The only ingredient I'm less than thrilled about is the tapioca starch (used for thickening), but it's listed after the protein sources I really don't worry about it.  When I was first considering this brand, I checked out reviews for it on other websites, and there were a lot of people upset that some of the flavors contain menadione.  I looked into this, and it's a form of vitamin K which is an essential additive in fish-based foods because they don't contain enough natural vitamin K and it's required for health.  The controversy appears to be based in that it was banned for humans...after a bunch of babies died when they were given great big whopping doses.  Fortunately, the amount of menadione added is so minuscule that I'm totally comfortable with its inclusion.  (And since it's not present in the chicken-based formulas, and since I think poultry is a better staple food for cats than fish, he gets that much less of it.)<br /><br />Actually, the chicken and pumpkin flavor seems to be his favorite.  I was a little unsure of using pumpkin, since cats are carnivores and carbohydrates can have some bad effects, but it's apparently good for their digestion.  Since I rotate the different flavors, the possible consequences are really reduced...and since cats seem to like to barf just to keep things interesting, I'm pleased about any possible stabilizing effect!<br /><br />Soulistic's website also promises to use human-grade ingredients.  No by-products here!  It even smells like regular people food, which, let me tell you, is a welcome relief.<br /><br />But the best part: the cat loves it.  He doesn't refuse it, he's not even merely indifferent to it - he devours it.  I've tried every single flavor of the "in gravy" flavors (I haven't tried the "in gelee" flavors) and every single one of them sends him into raptures.<br /><br />Seriously, it doesn't get any better than this.  There's a canned grain-free cat food with a high moisture content and shreds or chunks of real meat and fish as the first ingredients, and the cat loves it.  There are enough flavors to give him variety, both in taste and nutrition.  I'm sold!

review/summary: Bought for Pumpkin Ingredient
review/text: Purchased this food specifically because it had pumpkin in it.  Pumpkin is recommended for laxative purposes in digesting hairballs.  (Just spent a few thousand dollars having a hairball surgically removed from my 1 year old kitten.  UGH!)  Of course I cannot tell if the food is helping with that particular problem, I can tell you what I like so far.  First of all it smells 'normal'.  Not that nasty cat food smell.  Second, the top ingredients are all natural (real) foods.  You know, words I can pronounce.  The cat loves it, although since she's still young she isn't really that particular.  It has helped her digestive system in easing (not curing) constipation issues.  All in all I recommend it.  Only food I have found with the pumpkin plus it smells good and looks like what the name says it is.

review/summary: This Flavor Great for Cats with Kidney Disease
review/text: After months of research and contact with scores of manufacturers, I found this flavor of Soulistic to have one of the lowest Phosphorus contents which makes it a great food for cats with kidney disease.  I refuse to by prescription diet for my cat because of the low quality of ingredients so when I found this one by Soulistic, I was ecstatic. There aren't many foods available for cats with kidney disease which is sad since it's one of the most common diseases.  Add to that, a picky eater and you have a serious situation.  By lowering the phosphorus level, switching to canned food and encouraging your cat to drink more water (LOVE the fountains by THIRSTYCATFOUNTAINS-I HAVE 4 OF THEM), you not only extend their life but increase their quality.  My cat is my devoted companion and deserves the best.  Soulistic Chicken and Pumpkin IS truly one of the most nutrionally complete, safe and high quality cat foods available.  Be aware however that this review is for Chicken and Pumpkin only.  Not all flavors are equal and the only other Soulistic flavor with low Phosphorus is Good Karma Chicken Dinner in Gravy which I haven't tried.

review/text: My 2 cats are somewhat picky and older than 10. They had been eating science diet wet food, and then got bored and stopped finishing it...they LITERALLY gobbled down this stuff!! I tried the pouch of the tuna in pumpkin soup and they LOVED IT. They have also liked mostly all of the other flavors...def worth a try, they esp loved the poaches because they have so much juice in them and I think it is def keeping them more hydrated. They beg me when I ask them now if they want to eat. This stuff is def their favorite brand now of wet cat food and first time in years I have seen them continually licking the plate till its clean.

review/summary: Soulistic - holistic and makes our cat happy!
review/text: We picked up a couple of the packets (grain-free) at a local store and our cat is incredibly fussy. He will only eat one brand and a few types within that brand. On a whim, I saw the Soulistic cat food and decided to try two packets. The one with the pumpkin soup he gobbled up (amazing). The other one in the pink packet, he is working on. This company has an informative website that tells about the food and their commitment to nutrition. They have an enviro-conscious ethic which I like. There is plenty of moisture in the packets, which our cat loves and this is also good for their urinary tracts, as many cats don't drink enough water or get moisture through their diets. Cats need wet foods! I'm happy our cat will eat a high-quality wet food and plan to try other varieties.

review/summary: My Picky Cat LOVES this food!
review/text: I was advised to try this food by a worker at Petco when I was having difficulty finding wet cat food that my cat would like.  His wet food 3oz per day would sit in his dish for hours with him only touching a little bit of it.  It was a total waste of money for me.<br /><br />At first I was questioning the quality of the food because it was set in between the cheaper low supermarket brand cat foods instead of it being placed near the higher quality foods like Wellness, Natural Balanace, Blue Buffalo etc.  The worker said.... "just try one 3oz can and see if your cat likes it."  I looked at the ingredients and it looked like a pretty good food list.  I give my cat a dry combo of Nature's Variety Rabbit Food with Blue Buffalo adult so I know he is getting great dry food in his system so I wasn't too worried about the wet not being up to the level of the dry as long as the food wasn't full of crappy stuff.<br /><br />Well I gave him him the Shrimp flavored one first the other day and he literally ate it in 3 or 4 minutes without stopping to take a break.  I then went back to Petco to buy some more Shrimp and figured I should just try all of the flavors.  Well, there wasn't much to choose from.  Apparently cat owners are getting told about this wonderful food and the stores are running low on it.  I picked up the Chicken & Pumpkin(gone in 3 minutes again yesterday) as well as the Tuna in Gravy ( ate it this morning in less than no time) so I am really glad the Petco worker suggested this food for me.<br /><br />The foods come either in a gelee or a gravy.  My cat loves both of them.  I hate to tell more cat owners about this food in fear that the shelves will be completely empty when I need cat food but I just couldn't help spreading the good news about this new food I found.<br /><br />I would not hesitate trying this food.  It seems to be a winner in my house!!

review/summary: Delicious food and not as unhealthy as the "junk" on the market
review/text: I have 5 cats, and all 5 just love Soulistic.  My cats have always been dry-food cats.  After my princess got sick, I started researching cat food and came to the conclusion that wet food is better for them.  I've tried every brand out there.  My goal is to have my cats on a grain-free, high protein diet made of natural ingredients, and minimal by-products.  I've tried Wellness, Natural Balance, etc.  But my cats are just so finicky that they'll stop eating a brand after being served the same thing more than 2 days in a row.  But with Soulistic, they're still loving it, and it's been close to a year.  I notice they like the gravy ones better than the gelee ones.  I also try to switch up the flavors so they're not eating the same flavors every day as I find that they will be less enthusiastic if I keep giving them the same thing.  This brand is a bit watery compared to other premium cat foods.  But if you look at the "meat", it seems to be unaltered natural fish/chicken.  I don't know for sure though.  I think the watery gravy actually makes it easier to blend and tricks my cat into taking in more fluid.  Unfortunately, this brand is only available from Petco.  I'm not a big fan of Petco, but have no choice since my kids only like this brand.  I hope with more people buying this brand, they will start selling it somewhere else.<br />Oh, and my cat's favorite flavor is the tilapia and tuna (I think).

review/summary: Delicious taste, but you pay a premium to substitute fructose for sucrose
review/text: I eat this jam occasionally with peanut butter on crackers, and it is quite delicious. I love cherry preserves, and these are a very good choice for that.<br /><br />While this brand is less unhealthy than other sugary jams, I don't deceive myself that it won't raise blood sugar, because it is essentially 100% fructose, which is just as capable of raising blood sugar as sucrose (white/table sugar)--more on this below.<br /><br />Most people buy this product as a presumed health food due to it being lower in sugar than other jams. It's ingredients are: "Juice concentrate (pear, grape), cherries, maltodextrin (dietary fiber), fruit pectin, citric acid, natural flavor." This product contains no artificial sweeteners, which are associated with various health hazards.<br /><br />This product's primary claim to fame is that it is, as the label states, "sweetened only with fruit juice." Any jam will have its sweetener listed first, meaning that is its primary ingredient. If you are on a low-carb diet or diabetic, you might want to know that this jam basically substitutes fructose for sucrose. Since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose, the producers only need to use half as much as they would have of sucrose, so it has about half the calories of regular jam. (On the other hand, many cheap jams contain high-fructose corn syrup--but that's another health issue entirely.) The problem for many people is that they are used to the taste of sucrose, and 100% fructose tastes very different from a combination of fructose and sucrose which is the case with regular jam made with white sugar. To my own taste, since I'm seeing this as a fruit spread as much as a jam, it tastes quite sweet enough to me.<br /><br />The fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber, so I am not sure why the company decided to add in maltodextrin and call that "fiber" too. Anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam. The producers claim on the label it is "gluten-free," but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn, and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten.<br /><br />Another ingredient that is problematic as to how healthy this product can be is the "natural flavor." It is possible that the producers add a cherry extract so they can get away with using less real cherries, which are more expensive than a flavoring. The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: "The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.

It smells pretty weird, and whenever I eat it around my friends, I get funny looks and wrinked noses, but the smell doesn't affect the taste at all! Though you don't want to replace actual fresh fruit and vegetables with this bar, I do think it's better than not having them at all, and I try to keep one in my bag for the really long days. I definitely prefer eating this to vending machine snacks or yet another fast food meal (the only choices near my school).

review/summary: My health nut family member was right for a change!
review/text: I have a family member that is really big on healthy eating and often she suggests totally revolting health food with the promise of "okay so it smells a bit musty but it is soooo good for you!" Uh, thanks but no thanks.<br /><br />I was on a long car ride with her this month and some time around hour four when I was starting to think about finding a donut shop, she pulled out some Rebars for everyone in the car and said "8 servings of fruit and vegis! Try it!"<br /><br />I was hungry enough that I tried it out, and shockingly enough I actually really liked it. Liked it enough that when I got home I ordered a box from Amazon and am happily eating one right now. Like other people have said, it tastes mostly of apple with some raisin, but I don't like raisins normally (I'm notorious for picking them out of scones and that sort of thing) and I find that the taste of apple helps mellow out the raisin taste.<br /><br />I'm a nursing mother right now, and it seems like there are some days where I have maybe five minutes for lunch. The temptation for something junky but fast is always there, and I can see that having the Rebars around are really going to help me. If you are trying to find something that is super healthy, that you can eat on the go, and that doesn't taste like hell, I think this is great. It really leaves me feeling full for hours, and I feel good about not eating crap because I waited too long to eat and start craving fat, sugar, and carbs.

review/summary: best health bar without the sugar or soy
review/text: I've been enjoying ReBar for years.  As a vegan looking for a a low fat snack bar, this is the best.  Better than just having some dried fruit because it has Veggies also!  You get greens, veggies, and fruit packed into one bar.  I often roll a bar in some granola or nuts to give it a bit more built.  Great for some energy without the sugar and soy or milk proteins found in other bars. Taste is very nice, as it's not too sweet like date bars, but it doesn't have that odd grassy taste of pure wheat grass juice.

review/summary: Good taste, nearly lasts an hour, but a little expensive
review/text: I've purchased packs of this gum at my Walgreens a couple times before (largely when it's on sale). I like its taste and how it lasts nearly an hour. It also claims to have a quarter of the recommended B6 and B12 vitamins which is cool (I don't rely on getting my B vitamins from gum, I get them elsewhere). The $14 price sold on here is a little more expensive than the periodic sale of $2.99 for a 3-pack I see at Walgreens. 5 stars for the gum, minus one for the price.<br /><br />For those suffering with acid reflux, try chewing bubble or any fruity gum. When you chew bubble or fruity gum, your mouth generates more saliva offsetting the acid and bile that's been climbing your esophagus. Even though this gum does noticeably tame my acid reflux when I chew it, don't do it like me, with mint gum like this. Mint products only aggravate the symptoms of acid reflux even more. Go for bubble or fruity gum instead. Learned it from Dr. Oz.

review/summary: Fun treat - especially for Narnia fans
review/text: Before I lived in Turkey with the military, I never knew what Turkish Delight was though I'd heard of it in the Chronicles of Narnia (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe).  If you've never had Turkish Delight, I would compare it to the inside of a jelly bean.  It is served in small cubes and covered in powdered sugar to keep them from sticking together.  The plain flavor is similar to a white jelly bean.  I rated it a four because it is slightly fresher and softer in Turkey, but I was impressed with the taste.  Enjoy!

It was fun sharing it with the guests.  Most people had never tried it (us included)!  My son enjoyed it the most.  It is an acquired taste.  I think the guests liked being able to try something completely different.  My son has asked for more (not unlike Edmond!!!)

review/summary: Davidson's Spiced Peach tea
review/text: Ok, while I didn't like this one as well as Davidson's other peach offerings, I did think it was decent, and totally drinkable.  And this is coming from someone who doesn't really like tea, but is trying to develop a taste for it.<br /><br />The overall taste of this tea is a bitterness slightly spiced.  I didn't really taste the peach at all, but that was ok.  It was a good kind of bitterness, one that combined with the actual heat of the drink warmed you up and it was very calming.  The spices were hard to identify if you don't look at the package, but they reminded me of winter and fall, and getting ready to settle into the harvest.  The same kind of spices you would find in a cookie.  Although the clove did really stand out.<br /><br />The ingredients are good in this tea.  Organic black tea, organic orange peel, organic cinnamon and organic cloves with some natural flavor.  So almost everything was organic, which I wasn't expecting, but was pleasantly surprised by.  I do have to say the orange peel surprised me, I would have never guessed it was in there.  But I was a little disappointed peach wasn't actually listed, which is probably why I didn't taste it.  And the one teabag was sufficient enough for a large mug of tea after steeping for several minutes.  I added no sweetener to the tea either.<br /><br />A nice tea by Davidson's but not my favorite.  Still, the ingredients alone make it worth getting.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: The best ramyun as far as I know
review/text: 2011 has seen a new wave of Korean ramyuns coming. Shin ramyun black, Kkokko myun, and Nagasaki jjamppong are the three "premium" ramyuns and Nagasaki jjamppong is the best among those by far. Kkokko myun has same white-colored chicken-based soup as Nagasaki jjamppong and actually is pretty good, but not as good as Nagasaki jjamppong. Shin ramyun black seems to be a little bit better than ordinary Shin ramyun, but that's about it. Nagasaki jjamppong has very clean and freshening taste, a bit spicy but not too extreme. Ordinary ramyuns such as Shin ramyun usually have red-colored beef-based soup which sometimes can easily make you fed up whereas Nagasaki jjamppong is much less likely to do so. I hope its price in Amazon drop soon so that I can order it often.

review/text: These were actually better than I expected, they don't scrimp on the filling. One point, though, if you heat them in a microwave, be careful. The filling becomes superhot almost before the crust feels warm. Follow up- I bought these again at Christmas 2011, and was just as satisfied. Again noted the tendency of the filling to become very hot when they are done in a microwave. I also compared them to other brands- Hopper's, and Mr. Kipling's, and I think these are the best of the lot. I also prefer them to the the Glenfiddich ones, by a smaller margin.

review/summary: Great stuff! Especially around Christmas ...
review/text: Heat these up in the microwave for about 15-25 seconds and they're ready. Too bad there's NO MEAT inside! Mince pie (or mincemeat pies) are a traditional festive British sweet pastry, usually consumed during the Christmas and New Year period. Mince Pies normally have a pastry top, but versions may also be found without the top in which case they are known as a mince tart.<br /><br />The name 'mincemeat' comes from the original recipe. Up to the Victorian era the mince(meat) pie would actually have been a spiced meat pie with some dried fruit. Today the only remnant of the original meat is (sometimes) the inclusion of suet. Typically fillings today consist entirely of fruit-based mincemeat containing dried fruit such as raisins, currants, glace cherries, apricot, candied peel; spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg; nuts such as walnuts or chopped almonds; suet; and some kind of alcohol, usually either brandy or rum.<br /><br />Walkers Mince pies are suitable for vegetarians because the suet is replaced by vegetable oil. The pie is often finished off with a delicate dusting of either castor sugar or icing sugar on top.

If I can find this at a decent price, I will be buying more of it for myself. Sorry, Amazon, but $35 for four 12-ounce jars is NOT a decent price, not even with free Prime shipping. Not even close!

I was hoping the "nut" was a walnut, pecan, or almond (or all of the above!), but it's merely an unimpressive sliver of regular old peanut. After I got done picking the hard cranberries out of my teeth, I decided I would never by this flavor of overpriced, disappointing peanut-butter again.

I thought I was hooked on the Cashews with Sea Salt and Pepper......until today.  These are So, SO gooood!!  I, personally, have no issue with the Splenda in them, as I am one of those people constantly doing battle with the bathroom scales.  Better a little Splenda than a lotta calories.  And they taste Deeeevine!  Definitely worth trying if you haven't!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ55RW">Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, 11oz Canister (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Aftertaste - Contains Splenda
review/text: These are nice tasting and a nice change of pace -- I eat almonds daily and was looking for something new. However, I find that the almonds have an aftertaste to me. After closer inspection of the ingredient list, I found out that the product contains sucralose (Splenda). That is the aftertaste.<br /><br />I doubt that I will be buying these again.

review/summary: Delicious!  Bye Bye Sweet Cravings!
review/text: I'm not even a big fan of dark chocolate but these nuts are delicious! They are the perfect thing to snack on to help rid sweet cravings and they contain the same amount of fat/calories than the plain almonds. They don't even have added sugar!

review/summary: Nuts abot these nuts!
review/text: I read the reviews and thought they sounded good. I tried them and they are better than I expected. They are a great healthy treat. I feel like I am eating candy. They are addictive, its hard to stop nibbling.

review/summary: Cocoa Crunchy Fun
review/text: So about a year ago i go over my friends house and he offers me these Emerald Cocoa Almonds and i must tell you that they are delicious.  Even today i can't get enough of these things. The Cocoa flavoring is light and not overbearing.  The almonds are crisp and nice sized for snacking.  Should be healthier than honey roasted and caramelized almonds. In short an all around great buy if you are into great snacks.<br /><br />Money well spent.

review/summary: Loved these !
review/text: I just discovered these. They are GREAT for me because I am trying to cut back on "bad" carbs due to insulin resistance and PCOS. I have been craving sweets so badly (fell off the wagon during holidays and trying to get back on again!).<br /><br />The chocolate taste IS subtle but it is noticable enough for my 4 year old to say "mmm chocolate nuts!". He's really picky and he loves these.<br /><br />I didn't find them too dry or burned tasting. They tasted great to me. I bought the 100 calorie packets and they are great to keep in my purse. The 100 calorie packs have 4g carbs and 2g fiber.<br /><br />A chocolate candy coated almond this is not. It's basically almonds dusted in dark coccoa powder -- and sucralose is listed in the ingredients. The cocoa does not get messy on my hands and that is another huge plus !

review/summary: These are delicious
review/text: Twenty five dollars for 4? I bought these at Stop and Shop for 2.50 for an 11 0z. package.<br /><br />I would have enjoyed more chocolate but still enjoy them the way they are. I don't feel as guilty grabbing a handful of these as I would grabbing a candy bar. Very yummy and great to munch on at games, in the car, etc.
