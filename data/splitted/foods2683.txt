review/summary: Finally Some Flavor
review/text: Being a relatively new overweight, diabetic, with a gluten intolerance, my life has become a bit of a challenge. Especially when it comes to eating.<br /><br />I need foods that I can carry with me that don't taste like cardboard. I have been scouring the Internet and ran across these bars. I picked some up and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Good flavor, good texture, a little more fiber than most and on top of it, chocolate. YEA!!!!<br /><br />Not your typical gluten free, low sugar food. Good stuff!

review/summary: These Are Delicious
review/text: I've tried many low carb bars and these are very good.  Not too sweet but a perfect balance of sweet and crunchy.  They don't have that funny chemical taste that many bars have - probably because they are made with maltitol, which can cause gastric distress if you eat too much of it.<br /><br />One reviewer complained about the lack of nutrition information provided in the description, with which I agree.  However, I have that complaint with Amazon overall for the food items they sell, not just this particular item.  I look up nutrition information elsewhere before buying on Amazon, which shouldn't be necessary.

review/summary: Good but expensive
review/text: My daughter likes these a lot, but I wish they were more reasonably priced on Amazon.  Five dollars a can is ridiculous.<br />I am also still waiting to hear back from Happy Baby company to make sure this can is BPA-free.  The rest of their products state that they are, and this one has some metal on it, so I am assuming that it probably does have a BPA coating.  I dont see why Happy Baby didnt put these in a BPA-free container!<br /><br />Update- After reading about Happy Baby products that contain GMO's I am no longer buying from the brand.  Also, the company does not use sprouted or soaked grains so the nutritional content of the grains is not available to the child.  Young children have a hard, if not impossible time, digesting grains as it is, so grains are not a good food for a child under 1 anyway.  I wish I would have known these things earlier or I would have never bought these or given my baby grains as a first food.

My kids love the crunchiness of the munchies and I love the real cheddar taste. Another thing I noticed was that there was no salt or preservatives in them.  The canisters that we got were full to the top with snacks (so many times I open the bag and it is 3/4 full). Great value and great taste.  Definitely a winner and a buy again!

review/text: Brought a single bottle from another online store. Thank God I did not buy a whole 6 pack here. This tastes horrible. It almost tastes like some type of lemon medicine. Smells a bit nauseating too. I did not try it on food. I poured a little out and tasted it. Yuck. I thought maybe it was just me, so I let a friend try it. She made the same face like me. She agreed that it was horrible. I have no idea why 7 Up can't make a tasty mariande with their formula. It should be simple.<br /> Maybe it can taste better on food, I don't know. I doubt I'll want to waste my time finding out. If I do, and it tastes good, I will change my review. But from tasting it out of the bottle, I say, don't buy it!

We couldn't quite find the source of the problem so we looked into purchasing at home pest repellents before having to call up the professionals (this was our last resort).<br /><br />This product didn't have any reviews but was willing to give it a shot considering the price was only at $10.<br /><br />I began spraying cracks and crevices with this product around the outside of our house as well as the inside around the walls (NOT NEAR ANY FOOD). Did this about once a week and about every other day I would notice some dead bugs...eventually no bugs at all. (With use over a course of a month)<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this product! It really works! :)

review/summary: No more upset stomach and better health for our papillon
review/text: After switching from puppy to adult food our 8 lb. female papillon would often vomit at least once a day.  We were feeding her and our 13 lb. papillon Blue Buffalo food.  They both really liked it.  The larger papillon had no stomach issues with Blue Buffalo.  Our veterinarian suggested we give the small papi over-the-counter Pepcid (1/4 pill) a couple of times a day.  We tried that for a month and nothing changed so I did a lot of research online regarding dog food.  From that research I decided to try the Natural Balance L.I.D. sweet potato and fish small bites formula.  Voila!  No more stomach problems or any other issues.  Both papis are on this food now and the results have been wonderful.  The small papi gets small bites, while the large papi gets the regular sized bites.  They are each fed the recommended amount and they have maintained their optimal weight.

review/summary: Limited Ingrediant Diet wroks as described.
review/text: After doing a lot of research on foods for dogs with allergies, I happened upon this brand, and flavor in particular for its positive reaction for so many other dogs with allergies.  I have to say it has worked wonders for my dog.  Her regular itching, diarrhea, etc. occurrences that the vet could never figure out, and were just treated with various antibiotics,  were essentially cured with this food.  I also use the same formula for her treats as well.  That's it, no other ingredient types.  I'm very satisfied so far.  My only complaint is no local stores stock the smaller bite sin the larger bags.<br /><br />Just a note: I recommend this size even for 30-40 lb dogs.  The larger pieces are VERY hard and were a bit difficult for my dog to chew.<br /><br />The only con to this formula is that your dog WILL be going #2 more often.  It is sweet potato after all.  Mine went from typically twice, but no more, to guaranteed three times a day.  However her allergies are under control and she is happy eating the food so that is all that matters to me.

Most other hab sauces I've tried are either blended with carrots and tomatoes or they're supplemented with pure capsicum for "blow-your-brains-out" heat. Yes, this sauce is very hot, but it's hot on its own merits and you can taste the actual pepper flavor, which is why I like hot sauces in the first place.  This is a true gourmet hot sauce, not some culinary toy to play Jackass-style pranks with.

review/text: Of course how 'hot' a sauce is is a subjective matter, but objectively speaking this is a rich and warm sauce.  Since it's not mixed with carrots, sugar, lime and the like, you<br />taste pure habanero.  The sauce is hotter than most habanero sauces that are adulterated but is in no way obnoxious-I-dare-you-to-try this hot.  No doubt the heat and taste of the<br />pepper comes through but so does that of the food you're putting it on.  Highly recommended for those who like real heat and flavor without resorting to mouth-numbing<br />over the top concoctions.

review/text: Definitely has a kick, love the composition of this sauce. It just arrived today and almost half of the bottle is gone (I'm crazy about peppers, use them in everything even in oatmeal) The only thing that I do not like is a bottle, you really have to work your arm to get a substantial amount out of it, nothing that degrades quality of the product but it is a little annoying ;-) Almost forgot, but for a price I did kind of expected a bigger bottle....lol

review/summary: Great flavor, intense heat
review/text: Pure Habanero added amazing flavor and great heat to a recent batch of chili I made. It seemed to add a depth to the flavors that were already present as well as its own amazing flavor. A few drops to several cups at a time really kicked up the heat which is exactly what I was looking for though I certainly would sample straight from the bottle. Speaking of the bottle though, the extract is very thick and the bottle is glass with a narrow neck. It's just about impossible to get anything out. I used a straw but a better bottle design would be nice or include a suction dropper like children's medicines come with.

However, if you save it for the next day, it is not very good at all.  It is too hard and dry.  I make quick breads for breakfast & save the rest to eat later in the week.

review/text: After receiving a free sample of the orange-flavored Stevita drink mix, I decided to try the cherry and strawberry flavors.  The strawberry's sweet, but does have a slight bitter aftertaste.  It also took a little while for it to desolve in the water bottle.  However, it doesn't have that chemically aftertaste that you get with some drink mixes.<br />For someone who doesn't have a huge sweet tooth, or trying to wean themselves off of sugar/artificial sweeteners, the Stevita singles make a pretty decent alternative.

However, when you do the math, you are paying approximately 70 cents per packet and this doesn't even include the price of the water. If you still want an all-natural drink mix that is less expensive, take a look at the True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade.

review/text: I bought this for my diabetic son-in-law as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. My daughter had commented that he was drinking a lot of artificially sweetened drinks at work as they were easy to pack and carry. When I saw this product I thought it might be a chance to see if he liked it! They both thought it was great! The only drawback is that it is a little more costly than the popular artificially sweetened drink powder, but when it is a matter of health, one may want to opt in favor of a healthier product if possible. I suggest doing a bit of research on stevia to see the positive health benefits as well before making a decision...

review/text: I have had a huge problem with moles in my yard and had no clue how I was going to get rid of them. I hated the thought of putting out poisons so I purchased this trap just to see if it would work. I have never used a mole trap before but figuring it out was very easy. I already knew where the active tunnel was so I pressed down on it and inserted the trap into the ground. I lifted it up and down several times to make sure debris was out of the way of the spikes. After I set it I went in the house and about 15 minutes later I noticed it was tripped. I went out and dug and sure enough I had a mole. Talk about quick results. I can't figure out why others are having trouble with it, but my experience was good and I would recommend this product to someone wanting to get rid of moles.

I found his main tunnel going back and forth between the woods and the house. Did a lot of reading. Placed two traps on his tunnel, after pushing the ground back down. I set the trap as it is supposed to be set. Leaving him room to go underneath and push the dirt up again. One day later, and I got him. No more tunnels! Pulled them out and stored them for the next guy, if he dare comes. I am telling you, if you set the trap correctly and wait a day or two with a fresh tunnel, you WILL get him.

I didnt even have to move it around in different spots to get my kills either.<br /><br />The first one I got, the trap had been triggered but there was no mole to be found under the ground.  I pulled out the trap and saw blood on one of the spikes and knew I had got him.  The second one I got I found the lifeless body of a mole under the ground beneath the trap.<br /><br />This is truely a GREAT way to rid your yard of moles.  I read bad reviews of the different types of poisons and electronic pulse thingys and decided to go right for the trap and I am glad I did.

review/summary: Sweeneys Mole Trap Works Great
review/text: I'm on Amazon to purchase 3 more of these traps because my 2 local national hardware chains do not carry them anymore. There are 2 advantages of the Sweeney over others of the same type. 1)It does not rust like the others. 2) One of the spikes that support the trap in the ground (not the spikes that kill the mole) is turned sideways, making a wider path for the mole to come into, allowing him to be well under the "kill" spikes when the mechanism is sprung. Yes, the mole is killed, not trapped. And alas, the spikes just wounded one mole, and I had to finish him off. Ugh. But I digress. The trick with this type trap is to make certain that the portion of the tunnel where the trap is set is pressed down firmly so that the mole going through will actually push up the ground under the trap. Also, especially when the ground is hard, it is difficult to depress the support spikes deep enough so that the "trigger plate" is at ground level, a must if you want it to actually release as the mole goes through. To overcome this, I make a channel in the ground where each support spike will be located by pounding a chisel into the ground (and then pulling it out of course). Then you can easily depress the support spikes far enough into the ground so that the trigger plate is at ground level. One final clue. Before you pull your sprung trap out of the ground, depress the tunnel area where the mole came from. That way, if the trap spikes nabbed only a non-lethal part of the mole, you can stab him before he runs back through the tunnel. Ugh again.

review/text: I really wanted to use and like these traps for my gopher problem, but the fact is they aren't strong enough to pierce dirt that is even marginally packed, and the tunnel has to be no more than 3-4" deep.  Basically, they're useless unless you have VERY shallow gopher tunnels, very loose dirt, and very stupid rodents.  This trapping concept can only work with a foot long spike and a very powerful spring in my opinion... I ended up having to flood the gophers out instead.  And to top it off I bought 3 of these stupid things, what a waste of money.<br /><br />Grade: F-

review/text: Bought this trap at my local Menards hardware store.  Seemed ok at first...directions say make sure the lever is outside the metal plate, then set it (after properly placing it in the soil).  It 'set' once.  Didn't catch or kill anything when it went off.  Could never get to 'set' again.  There is a video on youtube where a guy says, "A lot of people are having trouble setting these traps".... then shows you how to do it.  Only thing is, the one you have in your hand will not set like the one in the video.  Completely useless.  I wouldn't take this trap if somebody tried to give me one.<br /><br />If that many people are having trouble setting this trap after following the directions then its a problem with the product.  I now use the spikes from the trap (useless for killing moles) to cook meat cubes on the grill.

review/summary: This trap activates fine, it just can't kill anything
review/text: I've had this trap for 6 weeks plus and it's activated no less than 6 times. Quite simple it is junk, a flawed designed that cannot be improved. Every time it has activated it pushes itself out of the ground. With no penetration of the spikes in to the ground it lays lopsided...no affect on the mole. I have moved it around the yard (grass, dirt, and sand), tried deeper sets, and making a depression underneath the activation plate. But out of all the activations there is nothing to show for it. Absolutely buy something else, anything else.

review/summary: no good
review/text: didn't work and the instructions on the box are lacking.  I ended up calling a "mole guy" and the traps he brought out were different (looked like pinchers).  he said the ones I had were crap.  He showed me how to place the different traps;  you find the two ends of a recent tunnel, get two traps, dig up a section of the lawn at each end of the tunnel.  place the traps in the hole, sprinkle some loose potting soil over the trap, don't pack it in.  (he said don't use soil with rocks in it, since rocks will block the trap from closing and trapping the mole).  the mole comes through and tries to clear his tunnel, and whamo.  took about 48 hours for a trap to trigger.

review/text: Overall this trap was a disappointment.  I've set it 50 times and almost every moring I would come out and the trap would be tripped, but it never seemed to catch the mole!  I came out this morning and the mole had triggered the trap and then just tunneled around it and kept going!<br /><br />I picked this one because the wife said "That one is better looking because it's painted, get that one..."  Well, paint flakes off eventually and now the thing is just a sharp, rusty tetanus shot waiting to happen.  I'm going to try the scissor style next.

review/summary: Good Cashews But..
review/text: Planters Cashews as you should all well know are great. There is nothing wrong with Planter's well besides the price really when Emerald tends to be cheaper and taste just as good, if not better.<br /><br />Anyway, the reason I rated this 3 stars was because it arrived dented and with the foil off some of the canisters and such. I contacted Amazon about this and recieved a prompt refund and no need to return the product.<br /><br />So in the end, I can recommend you buy these cashews, but make note that Emerald is cheaper. Also these are whole cashews, but quite a few were halves and pieces. When for quite a bit less can get a can of the halves and pieces.<br /><br />Has a great taste, but I will leave it up to you to decide if its worth the money.

The caramel flavor is light and sweet and the fiber in these bars (a whopping 9g!) makes them a very filling snack or a quick meal on the go! I typically enjoy these in the afternoon to carry me through between lunch and dinner but have eaten them for breakfast on occasion as well and they keep me satisfied until lunch. Fiber is one of the hardest things for me to get enough of (25-35g is recommended daily) and these bars definitely help! Some people have reported digestive upset when eating these but I've never had a problem with them. I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Taken for Gout
review/text: I had heard about some kind of juice being good for relieving gout symptoms, but I didn't follow up on it.  Now the FDA has given one, and only one, pharmaceutical company the monopoly on colchicine and so the price is going up something like fifty fold.  Yep, a ten cent pill will now cost five bucks.  Colchicine is made from the ground up stamens of Autumn Crocus flowers and was first developed by the ancient Egyptians.  People have been taking it for gout for centuries.  Fooking FDA.  Well, it turns out that it is black cherry juice that is good at relieving gout symptoms.<br /><br />There are several choices at Amazon, I think this one, the pint of concentrate from Dynamic Health for $7.63 is the best deal.  I have a Vitamin Shoppe nearby that sells their house brand for the same amount and I believe that their's is made by Dynamic Health too.  It's good stuff and I do believe it is helping with the gout.  I've been drinking black cherry juice for a couple of weeks.  I use two table spoons in 8 oz of water to make a glass.<br />The first week I was drinking a couple of glasses a day, by the second week I'm down to a glass every couple of days.  I haven't had any gout flares since I started drinking black cherry juice and I'm convinced it has helped.  I still have a few aches that I know are gout related, but no flares.  Now if I could cut back on beer and get some exercise even the aches might go away but......beer, mmmmm beer.<br /><br />Some people have said that they don't like the taste of this particular brand.  Taste like cherries to me but if you want something that taste "better" that pretty much leaves Knudsen and that brand cost considerably more.  As I stated above, I think that The Vitamin Shoppe brand is actually made by Dynamic Health.  I give it 5 stars, Knudsen may taste better, but at this price this is a fine choice.

The company responded immediately in fact received a personal phone call to my home on a Saturday inquiring about my status, after informing the company that I still hadn't gotten the order was told they would send me out another order immediately, which they did.  The owner of the company called me at work to personally see if my shipment had arrived, he checked himself and saw that it was in my city at the post office awaiting to be delivered to my home that week.  I was impressed that not a representative for the company called me personally but the owner himself called and discussed his genuine concern for his customers receiving their orders correctly and promptly.  That experience there alone has assured my that company is who I will continue to do business with in the future.

The Black Cherry type didn't give any noticeable results. It is still a good product, it is tasty and makes a nice juice when mixed with water. No reason to skimp on stars, but for information purposes, those looking for gout relief may find better results(as I did) with the Tart variety.
