review/summary: Delivery time
review/text: I bought a small container of Barlean's from the health food store about two weeks ago, just to see if I was going to be able to handle the taste and texture.  Day three I decided to stop ruining smoothies with it and just started taking it in 4 ounces of plain water (actually tasted better that way).<br /><br />However, $23.00 for 15 servings is more than I want to pay on a regular basis, so I ordered the Amazing Grass on Saturday.  It arrived today...4 days later.  I am impressed!<br /><br />Having just tried one serving, in 4 ounces of water, I have to say that the Barlean's tastes better and has a better texture.  But I don't care.  I'm not using powdered greens as a treat.  I'm using it for better health.  And, while it doesn't taste wonderful, it's not horrible either.  It takes less than 30 seconds to drink the four ounces, pour in a little more water to swish around to pick up what stayed in the glass and drink that, too.<br /><br />For 30 seconds, who cares if it doesn't taste like a chocolate malt?  Use a straw.  I do, and it's tolerable.<br /><br />I'll try to remember to update this after I've used it for a couple of weeks.  I do like the fact that it has twice as much fiber as Barlean's.  The only thing I don't like is that the nutrition label is so tiny you need a telescope to read it.<br /><br />***Okay, I guess the taste and texture bothered me more than I thought it would.  Shortly after I wrote this review I went back to the health food store and bought more Barlean's.  And I just got an order for a larger container from Amazon this afternoon.  So my plan is to mix the two, half and half, and just keep drinking it that way.  The Amazing Grass definitely isn't as bad taken this way, though I can still tell it's in there.  It feels kind of scratchy on the way down.

review/summary: Energizing nutritious greens!
review/text: I love Green Superfood! I did a lot of research about a nutritious vegan greens powder and decided on Amazing Grass... I don't regret my decision at all! These are whole food, minimally processed naturally antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies. I love the taste--mild and slightly chocolatey. Their other products are nice to try too, even the "Kids" superfood blend. The best thing is that I'm not only getting my fruit/vegetables and probiotics (1 billion vegan probiotics) in, but it makes me feel so good! Those rare days when I don't have Amazing Grass, I notice my energy levels are lower. I don't get sick either.<br /><br />Every morning, I look forward to smoothies with Green Superfood powder! The greens are best in a smoothie with fruits--it's very mild when blended with berrries and bananas, some non-dairy milk, and some fruit juice. It is high-quality, so expect it to taste grassy on its own, because it is what it is. That's why I find it fantastic in smoothies versus just plain with water.<br /><br />By the way, Amazing Grass offers a great deal if you sign up on their website to be a "Grasshead" and get recurring automatic orders quarterly or every 3 months with 15% discounts each time. Easy way to keep getting in delicious and nutritious greens!<br />http://www.amazinggrass.com/grassheads.html

review/summary: Worthwhile, but gross
review/text: I bought this because I felt I wasn't getting enough vegetable in my diet at college, and I'm sure that it has done a terrific job stuffing my system full of nutrients, but I am always hesitant to take it because of a few reasons.  First of all, as I'm sure must be expected, this powder (when mixed with water, of course) has a god awful taste. Thankfully, the drink doesn't taste all too bad in the moment, but the aftertaste leaves you looking remarkably like a cat wheezing out a hairball. This might be due to the fact that the powder doesn't dissolve fully into the water, and instead all sifts down to the bottom of the glass, such that when you reach the end of the drink you're literally drinking a gritty green sludge (even if you stir vigorously and then drink it immediately). The only other reason that I have any qualms with this product, is because you're forced to use so much water to mix it into, that you overload your stomach with liquid and it sloshes about for a surprisingly long time. This always leaves me feeling nauseated, and I always end up burping excessively and having the fight the urge to vomit.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy this product exists, but I wish there was some way to make it dissolve more effectively, or simply taste ever so slightly better. I've heard that mixing in a packet of Emergen-C does wonders for the taste, and I've also considered mixing the powder into something like apple juice to help the taste.  In any case, I'd still consider it a worthwhile product with just a few understandable drawbacks.

I use to be a bodybuilder and I am very knowledgable when it comes to supplements and can feel in my body when something is good and bad and I have had nothing but good from this drink. The nutrition that your body gets from it is amazing in many ways. I mix mine with coconut oil and a reds superfoods powder and a drop of mint oil and it tastes great. I have recommended this to all of my friends and will recommend it to you as well. Don't think about it just get this product and let it prove itself to you.

review/text: Just want to add my vote for this product - it's the real deal.  My wife and I have a smoothie every morning, and this is a key component.  It very much makes a difference.  There is a bit of a funny flavor, but it's more like a nutty, green tea flavor that we don't mind.  I love having a full serving of greens, including wheat grass and spirulina.  I'm almost 41, and I've also noticed I recover faster from runs and exercise in general since adding this product to my regimen.  Give it a shot - it's worth it!

I ordered the chocolate flavor of this powder and it is really good mixed with vanilla almond milk.  Unless you are really into this kind of stuff, go with the chocolate.  This stuff tastes really bad.

review/summary: Product has Alfalfa... which can be  VERY HARMFUL!
review/text: Please be aware that these bars have ALFALFA that can cause DNA mutation from a component called L-canavanine( this is an analog of an amino-acid that 'tricks' your body into forming  dis-functional DNA!). When studied in monkeys (they will not dare study this in people, even though there have been many case reports), ALFALFA has induced Lupus.I am vigilant to to beware these natural companies put questionable ingredients in their products!<br /><br />Alfalfa grass is in the bars and powder of this Amazing Grass product. I did purchase this product and did not realize it contained alfalfa until after I received it. L-canavanine(found in alfalfa seeds and also to a lesser degree in leafs) is a plant insectiside. L-canavanine occurs as a toxic non-protein amino acid in Alfalfa.  The seeds have the highest amount of L-canavanine ; the grass also contains this product. There are other plants that contain L-canavanine but are not common- Alfalfa is the most studied in this area.<br /><br />See the Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL - published in Autommun Rev. 2006 Jul;5(6):429-35. Epub 2005 Dec 29. has found:<br /><br />"One mechanism of its toxicity is its incorporation into proteins, replacing L-arginine and giving rise to functionally aberrant polypeptides. Association of SLE and alfalfa was first reported in a volunteer who developed lupus-like autoimmunity while ingesting alfalfa seed for a hypercholesterolemia study. This was corroborated with studies in monkeys fed with alfalfa sprout that developed SLE. Re-challenge with L-canavanine relapsed the disease. Arginine homologue L-canavanine, present in alfalfa, was suspected as a cause. L-canavanine can be charged by arginyl tRNA synthetase to replace L-arginine during protein synthesis. Aberrant canavanyl proteins have disrupted structure and functions. Induction or exacerbation of SLE by alfalfa tablets reported in a few cases remains controversial. Epidemiological studies on the relationship between alfalfa and SLE are sparse. In mice, NZB/W F1, NZB, and DBA/2 mice fed with L-canavanine show exacerbation/triggering of the SLE, however, BALB/c studies were negative. L-canavanine incorporation may be more efficient in the presence of inflammation or other conditions that can cause arginine deficiency. The L-canavanine induced apoptotic cells can be phagocytosed and a source of autoantigens processed by endosomal proteases. Endogenous canavanyl proteins are ubiquitinated and processed via proteasome. Incorporation of L-canavanine into proteasome or endosome can also cause disruption of antigen processing. Alfalfa/L-canavanine-induced lupus will be an interesting model of autoimmunity induced by the modification of self-proteins at the translational level."<br /><br />Please be careful with this product. There are many other "green foods products" that avoid the use of Alfalfa seeds or grass for this reason.<br /><br />Other research all accessible by public at Pubmed (among many):<br /><br />Prete PE. The mechanism of action of L-canavanine in inducing autoimmune phenomena. Arthritis Rheum. 1985;28(10):1198-1200.<br /><br />Rajkowski KT.

review/summary: Get the tablets instead!
review/text: I am about halfway through my 60 servings and I dread my drink a little more each day.  The first day, I excitedly mixed a serving into about 12oz of water and chugged down what tasted like a field of grass.  The next two times, my gag reflex kicked in, so I started mixing in some juice to trick myself into drinking everything down more easily.  The main problem is that the mixture doesn't really dissolve, so no matter how many times or how constantly you stir it, you still end up with a large amount of grit to choke down when you reach the bottom of the glass.<br /><br />I can definitely say that I am feeling better and more energized, and I haven't gotten a cold since I started my daily regimen (which is a rare thing...I usually have an ongoing cold from Fall-Winter, it seems).  I did not even think to look for this is a capsule form, but they do sell such, so that's what I'll be opting for once I finish off the powder.

review/text: First of all, let me say that I LIKE the stuff from WaWa or other machines, so that is what I was looking for.  I did not want some fancy cappuccino, but something comparable to the stuff I pay $1.50 for in the mornings.  Well, this stuff was very good.  VERY comparable to the machine cappuccino, sweet, smooth, good flavor.  For under $10 a box it comes to around .40 a cup which is great compared to the $1.30+ at the store.  I definitely would recommend it.

review/summary: Big Dissapointment
review/text: This is an instant product that's mostly cream and sugar.  Yes I can taste the hazelnut, but smell it more than taste it.  A small cup is way too sweet and the larger cup is weak.  It's so sticky sweet that I run a large cup of water through my maker to make sure it doesn't clog my machine up.  If you like the instant stuff you get from a machine at a convenience store then this is for you.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q37U">Grove Square Cappuccino Cups, Hazelnut, Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>

This cappuccino tastes delicious with no additions like milk, cream or sugar. Just brew it by itself and enjoy the perfect combination of a great cappuccino.

review/summary: The Perfect Treat!
review/text: I first tried this at my mom and dad's house (in the Vanilla flavor) and was hooked.  Then, after checking out the stats, I was even more hooked and ordered the Caramel right away.  I do a low sugar or sugar free diet and this fits perfectly into my diet as a treat.  With only 80 calories, 4.5 grams of fat and 5 sugars, it's a win/win situation for me.  I do brew it with 10 oz of water instead of 8, otherwise it's just a little too sweet for me.  All in all, I'm very happy with this product and will order more when I run out.

review/summary: I love these!
review/text: Normally I don't care for coffee at all, but I absolutely loved these!<br /><br />My sister got one of the Keurig coffee machines, and there were samples of these included in the box. She told me that she thought I would like them, so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />She was right! I absolutely loved these, and after running out of the samples decided to order some from Amazon.<br /><br />For me, they were the perfect ammount of sweetness, and I didn't find there to be any weird artificial sweetner taste as some other reviwers have mentioned.<br /><br />Now I drink one of these every day. The only thing I prefer over these are the Caramel flavored ones (also from Grove Square).<br /><br />I would highly recommend these to everyone. Especially people who normally don't like coffee. A+ and 5 stars in my book!

review/summary: Delicious Cappucino Hot or Cold!
review/text: I loved this Caramel Cappuccino. It reminds me of the taste of Tim Horton's Iced Cappuccino with the caramel flavoring. I made it hot and it was delicious. Then I made it with ice and it was even better!<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to buy this flavor because I saw a negative review and it came in a 36 count package. I didn't want to have to throw out that many Kcups if it was awful. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />We just started using our Keurig a few days ago so we're still testing out all of the good flavors. I've got this on my list of Kcups to stock up on in the future! The Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino is our second favorite flavor at the moment; our favorite is the Celestial Seasonings Sweet Southern Tea.<br /><br />Note: This cappuccino is very sweet. We love sweet drinks so this is great for us. I think it's perfect. However, if you don't like sweet drinks, you may not care for this.

review/text: I was very happy with the taste of this cappuccino!  Unlike the coffee's which i find to be a little strong for my liking this item was perfect! With the coffee i always use the large cup option and add a ton of cream & sugar to make it where it isnt sooo strong.  But the cappuccino is good even in the small cup option! It taste very much like what you buy at a good convenient store from one of their cappuccino machines!  Looking forward to when this becomes available again so I can order more.  You will really want to order this 3 pack instead of a single pack!

review/summary: Disappointed. . .
review/text: I do enjoy Hazelnut flavored creamers as well as french vanilla creamers in my coffee, I know the flavors aren't exact but  since I enjoyed them in coffee I might like them in cappuccino as well.  I love the french vanilla flavored variety they sell, so much so I've had to purchase additional (early) shipments from subscribe-n-save.  Unfortunately the hazelnut isn't so great, and not b/c it's 'convenient store' cappuccino either.  I prefer that over 'real' stuff.  It smells wonderful, but just something in the flavor that's lacking and it leaves a weird after taste.  Just wish I didn't buy the 36 count.  Definately buy the French Vanilla variety if you are trying to choose between the two.

review/text: First of all, tasted pretty good.  BUT, contacted a few Keurig K-Cup authorized on-line  sellers and was told by all that Grove Square are NOT approved by Keurig and using them will void the warranty on your brewer. Was told they are a "pirated" product.  Upon inspection, I discovered that the content are powdered milk, sugar, artificial flavors and INSTANT COFFEE!  Not even real coffee. Not sure if I'll buy again but does taste like Cafe Vienna instant coffee products with the convenience of Keurig. All authorized on-line sellers cannot carry them due to contracts with Keurig. Guess, buy at your own risk.

review/text: I ordered Grove Square K-cups - the cappuccino variety, for my Keurig BREWER.  As with all of the other K-cup coffees I've purchased, I expected it to be filled with coffee for my Keurig to BREW.  Unfortunately, it is filled with instant coffee and flavored with creamer and sweetners.  It tastes HORRIBLE.  I'm pitching the rest -it's not even worth donating to our church.  If I'd wanted Sanka, I would not have purchased an expensive coffee brewer - the microwave would have been good enough!  What I WANT is a cup of freshly brewed coffee.  The product description did not disclose the fact that it is fake coffee.  If a real cup of freshly brewed coffee is what you want from your Keurig brewer, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

I tried with all my might to get through a fourth of the cup but I simply could not do it. This so-called cappuccino tasted greasy and overly sweet at the same time. I did not even know that was possible for a caffeine product. I would have rather had gas station cappuccino than this garbage. I wish there were a way for me to return the 22 K-Cups that are left but, sadly, they will just end up in the trash. What a waste of my hard-earned money.

review/summary: If you like coffee.. buy something else
review/text: Imagine yourself craving coffee. But you're on... a big ferry boat. With a single coffee vending machine. The kind that you wouldn't venture near if you had any choice in the matter. But you need a hot beverage, or the caffiene, or something warm to hold, whatever. So you bite. The paper cup shoots out of some recess in the machine, and a close approximation of coffee pours into said cup, with the familiar, but suspect aroma of vanilla in the air. Then you taste it - and yup, it's exactly as vending machine icky as you hoped it wouldn't be. You taste the artificial, and you learn to settle for it. Because you're stuck on a boat.<br /><br />Well, Grove Square Capuccino Cups, French Vanilla - are just a little better than that. A smidgen better, not much more.<br /><br />So if you aren't stuck on a ferry boat (or train station, or gas station, or local DMV waiting area or someplace equally dismal), and if you actually do have a choice, I would urge you to at least try before you buy. So you aren't stuck with 23 k-cups that make you cringe :)

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I was really excited to get this product, as an alternative to straight coffee, for my keurig. Sadly, not only am I disappointed that it is not frothy, as the picture on the box shows, but 1/4 of the box are defective k-cups. The edges of the foil on top are not sealed, so the cups contents have leaked and the machine does not function properly if you still try to use them. I feel that I definitely wasted my money.

If you are ok with drinking diet soda you will be ok with these. If not I would stay away. I keep trying to feed these to guest but with very poor luck :-).

review/summary: Beware of artificial sweetener!
review/text: In two words...awful and artificial.  I didn't find any place I could find out what the ingredients were in this until after I got it and it tasted so weird.  I know, I should have checked it out first, but I didn't even suspect artificial ingredients would be a concern.  Anyway, it is non returnable but Amazon did refund my money for this because to us, it is not fit for consumption.

review/summary: Not As Good As Starbucks, But Better Price
review/text: I bought this item for an occasional treat but still have to find the right setting use to make it have that perfect flavor. The largest "Travel Mug" setting leaves the coffee too weak and the smallest "coffee cup" setting is too much and even the middle size isn't "just right" and sort of tastes like a "lite" cappaccino. I never thought I was hard to please but it seems like this has proven me wrong.<br />The price is pretty good so I can't complain on that note, but I guess I'm going to continue to drink this item and let it grow on me. As a now-and-then cup of cappaccino it's ok.<br />The 4 star rating is for the price and convenience of not traveling miles to get a cappaccino.

review/summary: Good Flavor, not real coffee
review/text: It is a great tasting "coffee" but in fact it is more akin to a hot chocolate than a coffee.  The flavor is coffee (not chocolate-y), but  I noticed it didn't give me the pep as my other Kcups, so I decided to open one of the Cappuccino Kcups and noticed that (unlike my coffee Kcups) this was only a powdery mix - NOT ground coffee placed over a filter - the standard innards.  If you are ok with the idea that this is a coffee equivalent of a hot chocolate powder mix, then this is a great tasting buy, with less pep than coffee.

Kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it?  I guess it's my fault for not having read the package? But no where in the product description does it indicate this is "Instant Coffee".<br /><br />I would never buy this product again.  It smells wonderful, but tastes like what it is, and that's simply not good for someone looking for a cup of coffee.

It is a mix that fully emties when you run it through the Keuirg.  A word of warning to the die hard coffee drinkers...this is not your Starbucks cappuccino.  It's more like your gas station cappuccino, which was exactly what I was looking for.  Great taste even on the largest cup setting on the Keurig platinum.  My new favorite morning pleasure.
