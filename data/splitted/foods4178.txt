review/summary: No more breast milk!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply.

review/summary: I Love Sage Tea!
review/text: I heard about drinking sage tea on the Dr. Oz show. Though sage is most commonly used in cooking, sage tea has been shown to boost alertness and mood, while decreasing anxiety, I was told.<br /><br />I find it very soothing. I was surprised that I actually like the taste. It's a woodsy taste just very appealing. It always makes me feel good afterward. The tea is caffeine free so I normally drink it in the afternoon or evening as I still need the caffeine coffee provides in the morning.<br /><br />This is a great product and I will most likely order it again.

review/summary: Great for colicky acid reflux babies
review/text: We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.

review/summary: Recommended by herbalist--love it.
review/text: We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.

review/summary: Red Raspberry Leaf Tea
review/text: I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.

review/text: I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot.

review/summary: Birthing Miracle Tea
review/text: I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.

review/text: This tea really works. Drink a big cup before bed and in the morning you will have to use the bathroom. Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now.

I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

review/text: I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

review/summary: Senna Leaf tea
review/text: A friend suggested this as I have been taking pain medication which tends to bind the bowels. He told me that this would help keep me regular. He was so right. A cu p of Senna Tea with my dinner has been better then metamucel for regularity. It tastes good, and I recommend it to anyone who has constipation problems due to medications. If you eat out, you can take the tea bag with you and ask for a cup of hot water to steep your tea in, and you do not have to worry about missing a dose.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

review/text: I love Valerian and I love it's earthy smell! But just because a previous reviewer hated the smell and threw a tantrum, (which is ironic because Valerian is used for its relaxing properties) doesn't mean it doesn't work! Keep that in mind when making your decision to purchase a natural product! Valerian is not like raw garlic! It's simply a very safe and effective herb which, to me, has a wonderful smell!

review/text: You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.  It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.<br /><br />You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!

review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

Like Fritos and Pace Picante Salsa, it was first made in San Antonio ... this beverage in 1913. I remember it as both tart and sweet with a mostly "grapey" taste.

I finally wrote to the company and they told me that certain Walmart's were selling it. I located bigger bags right here on Amazon! It was a much better value!

review/summary: Good bye Red Bull & FRS, Hello Orbana
review/text: I'm not an avid consumer of energy drinks; I occasionally drink Red Bull or, more recently, FRS to get me through tired spells at work and into the gym.  Those helped, but you felt a noticeable loss of energy and attention after the effects wore off.  I don't know the science behind Orbana - I understand it is the most healthy, natural of its kind on the market (although I never really believe those claims) - but what i can attest to is a heightened energy level over a sustained period.  You don't notice the come down; rather, there is no come down. And you don't become dependent on it.<br /><br />In short, it works. And for me at least, its better than Red Bull, Lucozade, Gatorade or FRS. 2 thumbs up!

review/summary: Orbana - a great marathon companion
review/text: I have really enjoyed using Orbana this year as I prepare for marathon season. I have done 9 marathons over the past 5 years and experimented with a number of supplement drinks for pre-race and while running. Some taste great but really don't do much good. Others taste horrendous:so bad that if there was any improvement in performance, it was hard to tell. Orbana hits the spot as it is proven, tastes great and gentle on the internal engine! Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Orbana helped me qualify for Boston!!!
review/text: I just ran my fourth marathon.  I had never fueled during any of my races or training except for water.  I tried Orbana for this last marathon during some of my training runs and for the marathon.  I actually PR'd by 16 minutes, and qualified for Boston with 12 minutes to spare!!!  The recovery was also incredible - I was actually functional after the race.  I highly recommend this product for any athletes looking to PR.  I will never run another race without fueling with Orbana!

review/summary: Near Perfect Pre-workout Drink
review/text: I have used Orbana for two different long distance running races (a 10 mile and a half marathon, both PRs) and several long runs (all at least 10 miles) and it is the only energy drink I have tried that delivers on its claims.  When I take Orbana, I have sustained energy through my run, which can be crucial for those difficult stretches.  I would highly recommend Orbana for any endurance athlete, especially for races.

review/summary: Delivers on It's Promises
review/text: Overall:<br />I would recommend this product to be used as a supplement for athletes to occasionally help boast their performance.  I do not think it would be a good idea to become overly dependent on this or any product so obviously use at your own risk.  All in all I think that Orbana delivers on what it advertises, especially as a pre and during workout supplement. I would say that you could find better supplements for post workout.  I will have to test it's effectiveness during an ultra event to see if it still has a similar effect at 2:00am at mile 72 of a 100 mile trail race.  I'll let you know how that goes.<br /><br />Full Review:[...]<br />Video Review: [...]

review/summary: Orbana is Great! Love this product!
review/text: Orbana is awesome! At first I was expecting a jolt, like the kick you get from coffee or other energy boosters, but this came on slow and soon I was hoping around the office crossing things of my to-do list and smiling at the same time. I feel good about drinking it and it helps it all sorts of ways. It's like taking my daily vitamins. If I didn't have time for breakfast, it gives me enough energy to make it to lunch. If I go running, I am sure to have one as I feel I am hydrated and can confidently push myself up the hill. I feel healthy, and that's enough for me to order again. Thanks Orbana!<br />Britt Ventriglia

review/text: I may not be a marathon runner like all these other reviewers *allegedly* are, but I like to have a little extra energy myself from time to time. Maybe I'm taking out an extra heavy load of beer bottles to the recycle bin, or maybe I just don't want to fall asleep in the middle of a good movie or baseball game. In either case, I have found this product to be very effective. When my friends comment that I look less lethargic, or am a less sluggish video game opponent than usual, I just smile and quietly thank Orbana.

I'm a professional cyclist and have tried nearly every hydration / nutrition product out there for cycling and bike racing.  From rides ranging from 1hr - 5hr Orbana has left me feeling the freshest and most "bonk-free" I can remember. I find I can sustain a higher threshold, for longer and recover faster after an effort. Nice job Orbana - thanks for sharing the secret- I'm onboard!"

review/summary: Orbana gives you the lift you need to get out the door!
review/text: I have always looked to running as a special treat to selfishly do something that is just for me. My choice distance is the Marathon. Last year I ran Eugene and had a great race with a Boston Qualifying time of 3:27. My friend was visiting from London around the same time and gave me a sachet of Orbana to try. It was a cold and rainy morning and I didn't feel like running, but I mixed my Orbana into water and drank it down. As I got dressed I started to smile with anticipation of my run. Orbana gave me the lift I needed to get out the door. Even though it was pouring rain I couldn't be more excited to be outside running. I flew through my run-I was hooked. I spent the next 6 months training for the Long Beach Marathon and used Orbana exclusively this time. I drink it 20 minutes before I run and again about 2 hours into my run. All I need to carry is water-I don't need to mess with all the ooey, gooey stuff that leaves me feeling ill. Last fall finished Long Beach ten minutes faster than Eugene with my PR of 3:17. Boston 2012 here I come! Thank You Orbana!

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I was looking for something healthy to snack on at night.  A lot of the mixed nut/fruit products out there are full of sugar, fat and other things that are not good for you.  This product is all natural and quite tasty.  To compare, the equivalent Kirkland brand all natural mix is 150 calories for 3 tablespoons.  The Terrafina product is 140 calories for a 1/4 cup.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is sometimes their fruit is a little sweet because they do add a bit of sugar for their fruit.  That's probably more of a personal taste than anything.  Otherwise great product.

review/text: This product was advertised as natural, so I wasn't expecting as good of taste as a product that the nuts had been roasted, salted, etc.  However, the raw texture and blandness of the nuts left a foreign after-taste.  The raisins and cranberries were flavorful, having a little sweetness added.  I definitely prefer a not so "natural" product to this one.

Delivery was quick.<br />Some of the reviews remind me of my first experience with sparkling water years ago when I discovered that plain sparkling water has no flavor.<br />I am  grateful for the peach-nectarine flavor in this, and like the motto on each can :  "As in life, chill for best results."<br />  In addition,  for the record, I drink this slowly since it's carbonated, always a  varied adventure with carbonation

review/summary: Inconsistent quality from can to can
review/text: This is the first time I can ever remember such a difference in a beveridge's taste from one can to the next of the exact same product.  My first couple of cans were very appealing, with just a subtle hint of flavor mixed in with the sparkling water.  Then out of the same case, I suddenly find a can of Talking Rain with an intensely awful taste, as if some absent-minded employee had left the flavor spigot on too long resulting in a very nasty, strong taste that was far removed from the delicately flavored water I had first sampled.  Doesn't this company have testers to assure uniform quality throughout?  Apparently not, which is very sad.

I really wanted to like this, especially since I've had such good results with other brands of similar products, but it's definitely a no-go.<br />However, Amazon very kindly refunded me the cost of the entire shipment, even though I didn't hold them responsible for the lousy handling/shipping which was out of their hands, and I thank Amazon for their consideration. I've had great results in shopping with Amazon, and will continue doing so since this is the only way I can browse, compare, and shop (am bed-bound, but prefer doing my own shopping). Thanks.

review/summary: Peach Nectarine: Taste Like Alka Seltzer
review/text: I bought this item with such great expectations but I am disappointed in the taste.  Yes, it is true that it smells great, just like peaches, and it has no calories but when you taste this beverage, it reminds me of alka seltzer (yes, the pop-pop fizz fizz medicine).  I don't recommend this product.  However, if you can get past the bitter taste you may like it, buy with caution.  You may want to buy only one case, (24) cans, for about $12.00 on subscribe and save to make sure you like it.  I have tasted the Talking Rain kiwi strawberry which is five calories a can but it tastes great; the calories are probably because of the juice and splenda added but I don't mind the five calories per can to have a great tasting beverage!

review/text: I like this water, but I agree with the person who said the flavor varies from one can to the next. Sometimes it's more peach, sometimes more nectarine, sometimes heavier and kind of perfumey. I think that's the peach. I don't know how else to describe it; it reminds me of perfume. But the price is great and, like I said, I like it. I buy a lot of unsweetened flavored waters from Amazon, and this one tastes good to me. My shipment wasn't very well packed--just the four six-packs and some paper in a box that was a little too big. Two of the six-packs came undone in transit, and the cans were loose in the box. I'm torn about saying this, because sometimes the packaging seems excessive. I get annoyed with heavy shrink-wrapping and boxes inside of boxes, too, but the loose cans were a pain.

review/text: I became a fan of Talking Rain while visiting my son in the Pacific Northwest.  Sadly, it's not available in my home state, and I was glad to find this available on Amazon.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the rather shoddy packing when shipped, the case of 4 six packs is placed in a larger box, with two sheets of crumpled kraft paper.  With the handling during transit, the cans come loose from the plastic rings and on occasion are damaged (punctured).  I received one shipment where the case was shrinkwrapped, and the cans stayed neatly in place and arrived in good condition.

review/text: I love talking rain water. I get cravings for carbonated beverages, so it is wonderful to drink these - which are calorie free and free of artificial sugars (ick!) These are way cheaper than the plastic bottled version. With mineral water you need to drink it right away or it goes flat, so I don't mind it being in a can. I love this flavor, it is subtle and tasty. When you open the can there is a wiff of peach nectarine which is delightful. I highly recommend this drink!

review/text: This coffee plugged up my pot and didn't have near the flavor I am used to getting from a flavored coffee.  I did use it all but ended up mixing it with another flavor in order to spice it up a bit.  I wouldn't buy this one again. I drink flavored coffee everyday.
