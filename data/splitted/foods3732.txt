review/summary: Wonderful mix of green tea and chai flavor
review/text: I like drinking green tea for the health benefits, but I find that many are either boring-tasting or bitter, especially without the addition of added sugar.  Luckily, I discovered Stash Chai Green Tea, which tastes great completely on its own!  It is a wonderfully fragrant tea with a tasty combination of spices, including cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.  The combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy (not as spicy as regular chai tea).  You can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai, but I prefer to drink it plain, as I think it's perfect as is.  Finally, the small amount of caffeine in the green tea makes Stash Chai Green Tea a great pick-me-up at any time of the day--highly recommended!

review/summary: very tasty but bags leak the very finely crushed leaves
review/text: Before trying this tea I'd been drinking the packets my husband brought home from Japan. The stash had the same nutty flavor of the good japanese green tea but the bags were fragile and leaked tea leaf into the cup. Just a personal pet peeve. I bought the Stash green tea based on a review I read in Men's Health magazine that rated Stash as having the highest level of anti oxidents (and Caffeine) in those tested.

review/summary: Nice mild minty tea, actually makes an enjoyable cup.
review/text: I've been tasting along several green tea's trying to find one that I liked.<br />I was beginning to feel a little like goldilocks. One would be too strong, the other too bland.<br />I think the spearmint in this tea adds an really nice note with the peppermint and lemongrass, making it actually enjoyable rather than a necessary evil.<br />I found the mint to be nicely pronounced, and the lemongrass to be only barely detectable, with a little bit of honey it's really good.<br />So if you're looking for a way to incorporate green tea into your daily routine, and like me you like it mildly paired with mint. Then give this tea a shot.<br />(I do agree that maybe you should try with a single box first, so that you're not stuck with 6 if your palate is more refined than mine)

review/summary: Very mild green tea
review/text: I am not a very big fan of green tea. I have always found the flavor to be a bit strong. I have had real Moroccan mint tea and found that to be a bit strong as well (in the mint direction). This tea was the perfect mild blend of both for me. And because it is all natural (no artificial or "natural" flavorings) I have been able to drink it every other day on my detox.<br /><br />Please Note: I did not purchase through Amazon. I purchased a box at Target. I would recommend trying it before investing in 6 boxes. I do plan to order this offer thru Amazon once my current box is depleted.

review/text: I'm trying to drink more green tea because it is so good for you. I'm trying all the Stash green teas one after the other. This one is a favorite as it had a strong Pomegranate and Raspberry flavor I love. By mixing these flavors in with green tea it makes green tea less bitter. The ingredients in this tea include: green tea, chamomile, hibiscus, orange peel, pomegranate flavor, raspberry flavor and Japanese matcha. A perfect tea with honey on a rainy afternoon.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Had this been labeled "green tea with a touch of pomegranate and raspberry essence" I might have rated this higher.  However, the name is pomegranate raspberry and I therefore expected those vary flavors.  The overall taste is mild and muddled.  I except a greater sweetness.  The tea's second ingredient, chamomile, has a distinctive presence.  While I didn't find the flavor to be unpleasant, there is nothing about it that would make me reach for it over one of my other teas.

review/text: This green tea by Stash, just might be one of the best ways to get your jasmine tea fix, and your antioxidants, to boot. The scent of jasmine blossoms comes through very nicely. You can actually enjoy this tea without any sugar, though I still prefer a little bit. There were no discernible aftertastes and I'd say the caffeine kick was light. I'd certainly buy this tea again and again...pass the crab rangoons, please!

review/summary: Exquisite Tea
review/text: I do not find this tea to be overly sweet and I take it hot or cold without any sweetener. I prefer it hot I find, but have tried it iced and found it to be quite pleasant.  This tea has a lightly fruity taste.  There are many ingredients, which I have found to be true of all of Stash's herbal teas.  To fear the ingredients, they are all top quality and marry well.  I wondered what "goji berry flavor" was and contacted the company.  Here is a transcript:<br /><br />Email reply from Stash when asked about goji berry flavor:<br /><br />Unfortunately it's proprietary information with our suppliers; however we do require natural statements from our suppliers. We use the Code of Federal Regulations as far as our definition of natural<br /><br />According to the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), the term natural flavor means "the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive,  protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juices, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible years, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in t food is flavoring rather than nutritional."<br /><br />There you have it, essential oil of goji berry.  Not so mysterious after all.  I recommend getting the superfruit sampler where you get to try this flavor and five others.  I have found them all to be outstanding and go back for more all the time.

review/summary: Clean and subtle rather than grassy, a stand-out flavor in a crowded field
review/text: I drink STASH PREMIUM MOROCCAN MINT GREEN TEA all day with no adverse "overdose" effects from caffeine.  The flavor is not grassy like some green teas, but very clean.  I don't normally like mint taste in anything other than gum or toothpaste, but this mint is subtle and goes great with the clean taste of the tea.  Besides green tea, the ingredients are spearmint, lemongrass, and peppermint.  Lemongrass is another ingredient that can be overwhelming, but if it's truly in there, I can't taste it.  So as I write this, I am realizing it contains a lot of flavors that shouldn't work for me, but they do!  In fact, I enjoy it so much, I get a little anxious if I let myself run low.  It's a great thing to be able to order it in bulk from Amazon.<br /><br />I do want to note that the tea can get a little bitter if steeped too long.  I try to go no longer than five minutes, but I often forget about it at work.  For me, it's drinkable but noticeable.  On the other hand, I'm not an aficionado.  I don't worry about the temperature of the water I use to brew the tea.  At home, I use the hot water that comes out of my Keurig coffee maker; at work, I use the hot water out of the filtered water dispenser.  As evidenced by the amount I consume, the flavor comes out great!

review/text: I tried to like this tea being that I bought a whole box, but I am still working on it going 4 months now. I drink at least one cup of tea at work everyday and I am partial to mint in my tea. However, there is little to no tea or mint flavor going on here. I have shared this with many people at work and it isn't just me.<br /><br />There are particles left behind in the tea bag with more aroma than the brewed tea itself. I always leave the bag in the cup as I drink it and it never gets stronger. There is nothing satisfying about it, I might as well just drink hot water.<br /><br />I do like stash teas but don't make my mistake, try it first. The packages I received are different than pictured now, maybe it has improved. I am disappointed.

review/summary: Stash Premium Fusion Red, White & Blueberry Tea
review/text: Amazing tea.<br /><br />That pretty much sums it up - it's an amazing tea. The taste is sweet and the smell is strong and also sweet. I love waking up, steeping a teabag with two teaspoons of cane sugar and half water half milk mixture. Adding milk gives the tea an amazing body and unlike a reviewer said below, there is no notes of green olives nor of cough syrup - this tea is simply astounding.<br /><br />I've tried Stash's Mango/Passion fusion and their Chai tea but didn't care for those, then I stumbled upon this one and O-M-G is all I had to say. The Chai has a somewhat bitter aftertaste and the Mango/Passion is forgettable on the palette. This tea however I love. The smell like I said is strong, super strong, and sweet. The taste is also amazing, very fruity and very very endearing. However, on the downside, I would not recommend that you make this tea with water alone, although it is a very smooth tea, it lacks body - thus, like I said before, make it as follows:<br /><br />Steep in 4oz hot water with 2 teaspoons of cane sugar (or substitute your own)<br />Add 4oz warm milk<br /><br />The milk as I said gives it extra body that the tea lacks, however it is forgiveable. Stash truly hit the mark on this one and hopefully they don't discontinue it - because the day they do discontinue it, I will be a very very sad man :(

The only thing I have to say that's negative would be the box design makes it difficult to grab the packets from the little like half circle opening, just open up the back otherwise they get all messed up and you have to push your fingers and root around trying to grab one of them and then pull them out etc.  Really good tea for a really nice price.  Even though I just bought 6 boxes, I would buy this again for sure (me and my family have already gone through three, and I gave one away as a gift).

review/summary: nice subtle flavor
review/text: I really like this tea.  I tried all the stash Fushion ones and liked this one best.  To get the full flavor you have to steep it for a long time. This tea also makes a great ice tea.  I make it like regular and then put it in the fridge when it cools down. You can use 2 tea bags in a standard tea pot and it makes a great strength of tea.  The listing says only 5 left, nearly out of stock, does this mean it's being discontinued? I am frustrated with Stash coming out with new flavors left and right and stores can only stock so many. Every time I find one I like, the stores stop carrying. I hope this continues to be available from Amazon.

review/summary: Cooks great. Tastes great.
review/text: This rice is a little tricky at first due to thicker bran.  Once you figure the right amount of water and time (about 45-60 mins) they turn out great.  You can time them tight and have fun chewing them or let them puff out a bit for a more cloudy rice.  The taste is great...I eat them by themselves with vegetables or they work good in burritos or Mexi-style dishes as well.  Recommended.

When I cook it, I use my rice cooker on the brown rice setting - and then add just a little bit of extra water, and it comes out perfectly.  We often put it with stroganoff, but we also like it with butter, salt, and pepper.

This salt is more mildly flavored than the black truffle salt I've experienced before both in the states and in Italy, which I believe is the nature of the white truffle as opposed to the black. Next time I would opt for spending more on a similar quantity of black truffle salt.<br /><br />Product arrived swiftly and in good shape.

review/summary: My dog loves them, groomer noticed cleaner teeth
review/text: I tried several different products to help my dog keep his teeth in optimum health and Dentastix work the best for the cost, and, my picky puppy-dog will eat them.<br /><br />I tried several non-edible "chew" products but he would not chew on them. He's very picky about what he chews. So, other than a couple of products that are edible, all the non-edible options for my dog are useless because he won't chew them. The other edible options are ridiculously overpriced.<br /><br />Our vet said that the Dentastix do seem to work and as long as he only eats 1 per day, that they won't hurt his diet.<br /><br />My only gripe is the cost. But Amazon sells them at a pretty competative price and my local stores don't always have them in stock, so I often purchase them here. (Walmart usually has the lowest price, but they don't always have the large stix in the 32 or 40 stix pack; Petsmart and PetCo are more expensive and, again, don't carry the larger packs.)<br /><br />I gave this item 4 stars because my dog likes them and I can get them at a fairly good price.

review/summary: Pooch loves these, I like the fresher breath
review/text: My dog Tucker has always been a Dentastix dog. He knows he gets one when I leave for work in the morning, and I think it is one of his favorite things. I was a little bit wary about switching to the new Dentastix Fresh, because really, why mess with a good thing? Luckily, Tucker loves the Dentastix Fresh just as much as the originals. His breath is somewhat less offensive, but nobody is going to mistake it for human breath after a dental cleaning and some mouthwash.<br /><br />Tucker had a little bit of an adjustment to the Dentastix Fresh, in terms of some looser than normal stool for about a week. I haven't noticed that problem since. The Dentastix Fresh have an almost herbal aroma, like a kid got in the kitchen and just started mixing together all of the green spices on the rack. Maybe a mix of basil, parsley, and oregano, I think. The ingredients list parsley, so I'll take their word for it.<br /><br />In the end, I would recommend Dentastix or Dentastix Fresh. I'm going to stick with the Fresh version going forward.

I read about the benefits of adding raw sunflower seeds to a healthy diet and I'm disappointed that it didn't work out. I will try another brand of raw sunflower seeds and see if that works out better.

review/summary: A family favorite
review/text: For many years for Christmas and birthdays our family would buy a box of Queen Ann Cherries.<br />I don't know how it started but our children would buy a box for daddy every year and for almost any reason.<br />He just loved them, they were filled with a nice liquid center and hardly every crystalized, that happened a few times but for the most part the centers were nice and  juicy.  The kids used to watch dad get all gooey (on purpose to make them laugh)  then when our children grew up the little grand kiddies would take on the roll of candy givers.<br />Sadly grandpa is gone now but we still buy each other Queen Anne cordial cherries in his memory.  It has become part of our lives and it would not be Christmas without that red box under the tree or on a pile of birthday gifts.

At first I thought perhaps this was a larger quantity, but after checking the description it's not; it's two little boxes, or four dollars worth of candy.<br /><br />As for the taste...I don't care for this brand as much, because it's the kind with the white creme inside with the cherries; I prefer the clear filling. If you're looking for this particular kind, however, and really like the super-sweet granular white sugary filling, then these are a good bet. Just buy them at the store instead of here!

review/summary: Fageolets From France!
review/text: Roland Green Fageolets From France are pretty good if you like Fageolets.  Fageolets are tiny, tender French bush type beans that are very popular in French cooking.<br /><br />The Fageolet has an inedible green pod about 3-inch long and small, light-green, kidney-shaped seeds. Fresh Fageolets are occasionally available in the summer. They range from creamy white to light green.<br /><br />Fageolets are removed from the pod when tender and just maturing. This bean of French origin is grown in the fertile soil of California. Its versatile flavor compliments lamb, as well as fish and chicken.<br /><br />Fageolets are usually prepared simply, in order to show their delicate flavor. Fageolets are a great source of fiber.<br /><br />Preparation:<br /><br />Soak in cold water overnight. Rinse thoroughly. In a saucepan boil 1 1/2 cups water. Add 1/2 fageolets and 1 tsp. salt to the water and simmer slowly until water is absorbed(about 1 hour). Makes 3-4 servings.<br /><br />If you can't find them, substitute navy beans instead.

review/text: I love Honey Bunches of Oats and have been a fan for years. Of all the varieties out there, I prefer this pecan version the best. It seems to be slightly less sugary tasting than the original, and more flavorful than the almond version. The pecans are delicious. Overall, this is a fantastic everyday cereal. Its light and flakey, yet satisfying so you don't feel hungry again in an hour. Easily my favorite cereal.

review/summary: The unflavored ice milk of tea
review/text: As no one has reviewed this, I thought I'd take the plunge and be the first. I'd like to give it a bad review, but "bad" would imply it having some qualities to describe. This tea can no more be "bad" than distilled water can be bad--there is essentially nothing to like or dislike about it.<br /><br />It was a bad sign when I opened the bad and smelled...nothing. But that doesn't always mean much, so I brewed up a pot, using about a tablespoon for a 14-ounce mug. I tried it after a couple of minutes and it didn't have much flavor, so I gave it another two or three minutes...still nothing. While it develops a lovely color and is composed of what open into large leaves, it has no aroma, no flavor, really no distinguishing characteristics at all. At work later on, I filled up the strainer in my three-cup Chantal teapot and gave it a good 10 minutes. It's possible some flavor may have developed, I'm not sure. I could have been imagining it.<br /><br />And now I'm stuck with 2.2 pounds of this stuff. I'd better develop a taste for a nice, hot, steaming cup of water, because that's what I'll be having for quite a while.<br /><br />I previously purchased the Malden sencha; it's more than adequate.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003466CMM">Fine Japanese Sencha.

review/summary: One of the Best!
review/text: I won't say this is the best coffee in the world; because I have yet to try them all and everyone's tastes differ.  However, from my 20+ years of coffee drinking and of all the Kona coffee's I've tasted, THIS one reigns supreme.  And it better for that price!  But if you appreciate a well rounded, flavorful coffee, then this is the one to try.<br /><br />I lived in Hawaii for 3 years and was introduced to Kona coffee at the source.  Of all the coffees I've had in my life, Kona is my favorite.  It is the richest and smoothest you could imagine.  Others are good, but not in this class.  Also, watch out for Kona coffee blends.  They can be tasty, but are usually only 10% Kona beans and not the top crops at that.  This is the primo stuff here!  There really is something in that Volcanic soil on the Big Island.<br /><br />A word of caution though.  Drink this at your own risk.  It is very hard to go back to "normal" coffee after tasting this nectar of the gods.  Enjoy!

review/text: I am a medical school student and you might imagine how much coffee goes through my system in any given year.  I had Aloha Island first when I was an undergraduate and have since given up all other coffee.  Kona is by far the best there is out there, and Aloha Island is amazing.  I have tried 100% Kona from other retailers since my first dalliance with Kona, but not even the best of the premium coffees compare to the rich taste of Aloha Island's gold collection (which is their lowest grade).  The rich, dark grounds are perfect every time and make the perfect study break.  Now they say that the diamond collection is a special treat, but once you have a really good coffee it is so hard to go back to something that is below it.  I highly reccommend the diamond collection.  Word to the wise: don't stock up on this coffee; while it does last quite some time even with the most careless keeping, the coffee is best when kept in an airtight container and ground fresh for every cup.  The longer you keep coffee around, the more flavor it loses.

review/text: I am not a raving optimist and am a highly ciritical comsumer. I have never before publicly rated any product 5 stars. This is a 5-star product.<br /><br />Why? It tastes good :)<br /><br />Seriously, it has near-zero acidity, an inviting aroma, and can be drunk without prior consideration as a "dessert coffee" just as easily as a "breakfast coffe". It's as versatile as a swiss-army-knife and as refined as the highest grade Damast linen.<br /><br />I have had 7 other distinct Kona coffees purchased on my behalf on the Kona island and brought home for me to try. All others Konas were compared to this one and found lacking (in some cases seriously lacking). No "Kona blend" will ever again be found acceptable once you drink this coffee.<br /><br />So, not only is it a 5-star coffee among general coffees (including the "Charbucks" of the world...yech!), but it is a 5-star coffee among other high-achiever coffees.
