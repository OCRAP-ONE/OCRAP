review/text: I've tried various dark roasts with K-cups and could not find something that was dark and rich enough.  Tired the Caribou, Jet Fuel, French Roast....nothing.  My apartment smells great and this is a smooth, rich cup of coffee.  I highly recommend it to dark roast lovers.

review/summary: If you like a dark and toasty big mug with just one K-cup, this will do it.
review/text: I have real issues trying to find a K-cup that will give me a robust-tasting enough mug of joe. For a while, I'd found near-perfection in the Coffee People extra bold mix... especially the Wake-Up Call (which got horribly expensive all of a sudden), but even those I only made on the middle setting of our brewer, and never the largest.  The Double Black Diamond still satisfied me on the largest setting, and has an intense, smoky dark edge that reminds me of the coffee that first converted me to the Pacific Northwest style of espresso---one I had a a tiny, roadside espresso stand out in the middle of nowhere between Tumalo and Sisters, in Oregon.  (It's probably not there any more--this was back in the 90s. LOL)  Anyway, it's definitely robust, and as I use milk/creamer, I don't find it bitter at all, but rich and worthy of savoring.  It will stand up nicely to a shot of your favorite flavor, and even shines through getting mixed with cocoa and vanilla for a toasty mocha.<br /><br />I just wish the coffees I'm finding out that I really, really like weren't shooting up into the "Can't Afford" ranges. But for those who love bold, smoky dark roast---this one is a real winner! I will keep it on hand for the times when I sit down with breakfast or with my Kindle to savor a cup of coffee rather than drink it in haste on the way out the door. But, if I find this coffee "loose" I'm getting it for my Eko-Brew reuseable K cups for sure.

review/text: I have been searching for a nice strong coffee for my Keurig that doesn't leave a bitter or flat aftertaste.  This a very nice bold flavored coffee that seems to fit the bill.  I am a bit spoiled after tasting Barista Prima's Italian roast as it has such a nice rich full-bodied flavor.  It is a bit pricier so the Double Black Diamond is a nice close second at a more affordable price.  I like my coffee black or with a little milk and this does not leave you wondering where the coffee went!

review/text: I have been drinking Starbucks brand coffee with my Tassimo brand machines for years.  It was the perfect combination for me.  Now that they have stopped making Starbucks inserts I was forced to look for an alternative.  I bought a K-cup machine because it appears to be the dominant brand on the market.  This coffee is actually better than the original Starbucks!  I will not go back to the Starbucks brand even if they start making it for the K-cup machines.

Since purchasing my brewer, I've tried many varieties and Double Black Diamond is my favorite. I drink my coffee black so I don't like weak coffee - I want it to be bold and smooth, not bitter. Black Diamond will not disappoint if you like good coffee. My other favorites are Green Mountain Expresso Blend and Coffee People Jet Fuel. I love my Cuisinart K-Cup Brewer - easy to use and no clean-up. I can make just one cup of fresh coffee whenever I want and don't end up throwing away unused or old coffee. And happily, I've found Double Black Diamond to start my mornings!

review/summary: strong, burnt and bitter
review/text: I typically use my Keurig as a hot water dispenser, running it without kcups because they generally are too weak, even on the small cup setting.<br /><br />So, I'm very much in the market for stronger k cups.<br /><br />I can make medium size cups with this pod, but it's still a bit weak, and still bitter.  Makes a very strong small cup.  Perfect would be 2 pods, one cup, one brewed on short and the other on medium.<br /><br />As for the flavor of the beans, they produce a full bodied, bold and bitter cup.  Not necessarily a bad bitter, as it is pure arabica, however, I personally wouldn't recommend having more than one cup of these a day.  That bold flavor loses it's luster cup after cup, so it's not really a good all-around coffee.<br /><br />It's a good first or second cup of the morning coffee.  It's kind of like a cup of "good new york city coffee" back before the coffee renaissance of the past decade.<br /><br />Buying this in the extra large amount may not be suitable from an individuals' point of view because it's not something you'll want to drink 2+ times a day.

review/summary: I like it for my little wife
review/text: I love K-Cups coffee.  They are easy and one always has a FRESH cup of coffee in less than a minute.  However, coffee this way can be quite expensive.  I myself use those refillable cups that one can find on amazon.  I have a half dozen of them.  I fill them with grocery store cheap brand and set my Keurig for the 6oz expresso cup.  It makes great strong coffee.  My wife on the other hand is lazy and doesn't want to mess with the two seconds it takes to fill the refillable little baskets.  She loves the Green Mountain Extra bold and as I buy it for her she doesn't care how much it costs.  It's good coffee and keeps my wife of forty years off my back.  I'd pay twice as much for that feature alone.

review/text: Impressed,as always,with Amazon's expedient delivery. I perused customer reviews before ordering and felt comfortable with my choice (I was going to get the Emeril Bourbon Street blend , which I love) as reviewers gave this a great rating. I find it strong but bitter as opposed to strong and rich. Would not recommend this blend to anyone. No negatives to Amazon but wonder who could find this a pleasurable coffee.

review/text: There's a Keurig machine at my new job, and they have a couple varieties of K cups that I haven't seen in local stores or wholesale clubs. My favorite, easily, of these is "Double Black Diamond", the darkest, boldest coffee offered by Green Mountain. So I checked for prices on-line. I was psyched to find this box of 50 for a reasonable 57 cents each or so delivered to my doorstep. I ordered on Wednesday, and the coffee showed up Saturday morning in time for brunch. Hooray to Green Mountain and Amazon. We'll be ordering more soon.

review/summary: Almost too strong!
review/text: My biggest gripe with the Keurig pods is that the coffee is too weak so I always try the bold varieties.  I think I met my match with this one though. Its almost too strong for me.  I take my coffee black and this one has just a hint of bitterness. I have to use the tallest coffee cup setting when I use this pod.  Dont get me wrong...its a good cup of joe but for my taste I think I like the Emerill bold pods a tad better.<br /><br />On the plus side you can often reuse this pod for a second cup as its strong enough to still make a good cup second time around.

And with that affliction comes the experience of having consumed a crap-load of coffee from all over, K-cups and otherwise.  In the end, Highlander-esque, there can be only one, and the Double Black Diamond is that coffee.  This is the untouchable, best Keurig coffee that I have ever encountered and I am relatively sure that once or twice while drinking it I experienced the mythical Quickening.<br /><br />Buy it, don't buy it, I don't care, just get out of my way so I can keep drinking it.  I just want to die with the taste of it on my lips.

review/text: Every time I get a new Keurig k-cup to try, it just gets better and better most of the time.  This one is no exception.  Green Mountain Double Black Diamond is AWESOMELY bold, and makes a great 6oz. cup. (And it is strong, so you may like an 8oz. brew on this one!) You can tell by shaking the k-cups that these bolder flavors are ground more finely, almost like an espresso.  This really is the best k-cup coffee I've tried so far, just edging out "Dark Magic" because of it's arabica origin.

review/summary: Strong Bold Taste
review/text: I like strong coffee and this fits the bill. My favorite is Barista's Italian Roast with Starbucks Verona close behind. Green Mountain Double Black Diamond is almost as good as those 2 but less expensive. I will buy this again.<br /><br />To save money, we have been making our own Kcups by reusing the brand cups -- after use, peel the foil top off, try to get all off the edge (but not necessary). Rinse out the used coffee. There is a filter built into the cups. We bought some Kcup lids on Amazon - 100 for about $15. Fill the rinsed out cup with your own favorite coffee, snap on the replacement lid and you are good to go. When placing in cup holder, make sure the little hole on the bottom from first use puncture is at the top and fits back onto the bottom pin - that way you do not get 2 holes in bottom of Kcup. You can resuse the Kcup many times befor it wears out.<br /><br />In the morning I will start off with GM Double Black and then for 2nd or 3rd cup use one we filled. Someday's I splurge and start with Barista Italian Roast.<br /><br />If you like strong, bold coffee, try the Black Magic. It is smooth without much of a bitter after taste. Although, I kind of like that after taste. It is too bold for my wife, so I tell her to reuse the Kcup I just used and make an 8oz cup... makes a good cup of coffee, just not quite as strong... and we get 2 cups out of the one Kcup.

review/summary: Nice replacement for Green Mountain Coffee's Espresso Blend
review/text: Upon trying to replenish my supply of Green Mountain Coffee's Espresso Blend, I found they had discontinued it.  I hesitated to buy Timothy's Espresso Blend (now the only espresso k-cup on the market) due to the reviews but have since tried GMC's Dark Magic and now GMC's Double Black Diamond.  Double Black Diamond doesn't have the flavors the Espresso Blend has but it has a very good flavor on its own.  It has no bitter aftertaste as you would expect with such a strong, extra bold coffee.  Where the Dark Magic was too weak for my daily latte, the Double Black Diamond makes for a very fine latte.  This is my pick as a substitute for GMC's Espresso Blend.<br /><br />Update: I've been drinking this coffee for a few weeks now and have to say, it is great.  It is my new favorite!  Also, bought a couple of Extra Bold Roast k-cup coffee sample packs via Keurig and haven't found any better than GMC Double Black Diamond.

review/text: I grew up drinking coffee in New Orleans.  I have been soooo disappointed with all of the K-cup coffees because they are so mild. After reading reviews, I decided to try all the ones that were said to be good, strong coffees.  First I tried Jet Fuel.  It is strong, but no taste.  Then I tried Paul Newmans dark roast.  It was so so, but nothing special.<br />I saw the Big Easy k-cup and thought, this must be it.  It is good. Don't get me wrong.  It is my second choice.  But the winner is  Green Mountain Double Black Diamond! It is really, really good.  If you like your coffee strong and bold with great flavor, this is the one.  I don't care what it costs.

review/summary: Bold, Rich, Divine!
review/text: In my search for the boldest, richest, darkest blend for Keurig, Double Black Diamond wins hands down. When compared to traditional coffees, it is comparable to Cafe Du Monde. I am actually quite surprised it doesn't have chicory in it. It is bold and rich without being at all bitter. Prior to this coffee, I thought Starbuck's Italian roast was the boldest commercial blend. But, Double Black Diamond makes it look weak in comparison. It brews to an almost jet-black and is very dark and earthy without a hint of bitterness or sweetness. It is very much like an espresso and I suspect it may contain as much caffeine. I am very surprised to find a Keurig blend that is comparable to the best French Market coffees and Italian espressos.

review/text: I found that this coffee was much more BOLDER than the JET FUEL that I had before. If I would have known it was that much stronger I would not have bought it. It is good, I just make the smaller cup and blend it with another flavor ,such as cinnamon. Other than that I like it. I will not buy it again though, it is to bold for my taste buds.

review/summary: GM Double Black Diamond - Pretty good.
review/text: One of my concerns with the K-cup brewers is that I wouldn't be able to get a good, strong cup of coffe, which I love.  It has taken a few orders of different varieties to find a strong one that has the right blend of bold, flavor and bitterness.  Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond meets most of that criteria pretty well.  It is a little more on the bitter side than I normally prefer, which I why I only gave 4 stars, but overall a great bold cup of coffee.  I would order this variety again.

The Nantucket Blend is a great coffee for anytime of day or night.  I usually wait until Amazon has a sale on these to make my purchase...Make sure when you buy k cups that the Amazon Prime logo appears...Without the Amazon Prime Logo, I have found what I received in the past did not reflect what I had ordered.. Substitution get made without your knowledge and sometimes count is short, etc...

review/text: Bought a Keurig for times when a single cup of coffee is all that is needed.  What I had not anticipated was that my husband was underwhelmed with the assortment of coffees that came with the brewer... until I found the Double Black Diamond Extra Bold. Now my Keurig is being used for afternoon coffee breaks and I don't feel like my "investment" is headed to a yard sale/thrift shop anytime soon.  If you are a lover of stronger, premium coffee, this may be exactly what you are looking for when a pot of coffee is simply too much for one.

review/text: This is one of my favorite K-Cups, and over the last several months I've sampled pretty much all the "extra bold" ones I can find. This one is very dark and strong without being too bitter (although I don't mind a little bit of bitterness in mine). They are similar to the Green Mountain "Dark Magic" variety, but I find that they are stronger, and perhaps a little more bitter. For reference, my favorite K-Cup is the Starbucks French Roast variety, but I also really like this kind, Green Mountain Dark Magic, and Emeril's Big Easy Bold.

We have not been disappointed.<br /><br />This has a french roast taste, which is a favorite of his but not usually a favorite of mine. The coffee is not bitter nor does the coffee taste burnt.  Pretty decent on days where I want something with more of a punch.<br /><br />I am glad this is the brand/blend that I chose.  I probably won't be experimenting with the K-cup bold blends. This one works for us.

Double Black Diamond is getting there, but it's still a touch weaker than I prefer.  Green Mountain's Dark Magic, or Sumatra Reserve, go a little darker and deeper and are, in my estimation, the five-star K-cups.  This one's close, but still not on the target.

review/summary: My favorite morning cup
review/text: I've tried lots of different coffees in my Kuerig brewer located in my office.  I like strong coffee, but it also has to be smooth.  Some of the stronger coffees tend to be bitter, but at least for me the double black diamond is smooth and tasteful.  While I drink some other flavors just for variety, this is by far my favorite for that first cup in the morning.
