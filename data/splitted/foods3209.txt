review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: This is an excellent dog food. My dog just had IVD surgery and has been on the canned dog food - chicken and brown rice. Not only does my dog love it, but he does not have problems with his bowels (like he does on other canned 'wet' dog foods). His stools are still solid (although softer) and I can mix the food with water, since my dog is in need of more water in his diet. I love the product, although much pricier than other canned food, but well worth it. No problems whatsoever.

review/summary: excellent, healthy dogfood
review/text: I was looking to change my dog's canned food as he is getting on in years and I wanted a more nurtitious healthy brand than what I was currently using. My dog loves this food and eats it heartily. I feel better knowing he is eating an organic food from a company I trust...I would recommend it highly. I also signed up to receive automatic delivery which saves money. With that discount this is the least expensive pricing I have been able to find.

review/summary: Great Ingredients
review/text: I have been cooking for my dog since before the pet food scare, that gets to be too much at times when you have other things to do or aren't feeling well, I have been feeding the dry Newmans for 3 years but have a spoiled cocker who has to have a little 'something' in with her dry.....this canned food drives her crazy, she just loves it, must be the whitefish in. She gets a teaspoon or so in with her dry & cleans the bowl...Amazons price beats that big box store when you use subscribe & save.

review/summary: my dogs love this food!
review/text: First, I feed my dogs fresh raw food I make into patties and frez, each morning they eat one frozen,and I give them Fish oil, Garlic and Klamath shores Blue Green Algae caps. Then at night I give Newmans Chicken can food and mix in their Probiotic Miracle & Enzymes and Plaque off. Then they always have their dry food (Taste of the wild, grain free)anytime they are still hungery.<br /><br /> My 2 big dogs are very healthy at 8 years old, hardly get fleas anymore, I don't use chemical flea or heartwormer products anymore, as one dog had a bad reaction to them and lost most of his hair and had hot spots for two years. Then nat. path vet said my other vet should not have given him the yearly vacinations,which also caused the problems. He went on a 10 week detox after that.)<br /><br />For the alternative heartwormer I do 1 week each mo. I give my dogs Natures sunshine Artemisia Combination 2 in the morning, 1 at night with 1 BlackWalnut. then 2 times that week I will give them 1 HS2. I give these about 20 min. before I give them morning food. Then at night before bed. My dogs weights are 100 and 70. The dog that had allergey, I also would give him first thing in the morning, before eating, Transfer factor, or colostrum, also everyother day a kelp tablet, which I think helped the hair grow back in. I used emu oil with lavender oil and tea tree oil mixed in, on the hot spots. Also for the ears, I used Zymox, OTIC Enzymatic Solution. it worked great.<br /><br />Hope this info helps someone.

review/text: I did not post this under packaging review, because the order arrived fully sealed, no markings or damage to the outside box, but 8 out of the 12 cans were severly dented, so I had to assume they had been packaged that way.  They were even hard to open with the can opener.  I will still get my subscribed monthly order, but if it happens again I will probably cancel it.  I have no problems with the quality of the product, just very dissatisfied with the way it was mailed.

review/summary: All flavors repeatedly make my dog terribly sick
review/text: At first, I thought my toy schnauzer had gotten into something that made her very sick but I took her off the Newman's Own anyway just to be safe (a decision made by my vet and I after I took her into the ER that night). I decided to try again a few days ago because it appears to be an excellent food (ingredient-wise) and we hadn't pinpointed the specific problem but, yet again, it wasn't even an hour before she was horribly sick and the effects of one feeding have lasted for days (Thank God I have medication left over from our last trip! I'm trying to avoid another vet visit but we're not in the clear yet). Even the stray cats on the block won't touch it and they pretty much eat anything. Definitely won't be trying it again.

review/summary: We Both Love It
review/text: My Husky/Samoyed mix, The Lovely Marie, adores this food. As soon as I open a can, she starts dancing in circles. I think she especially loves the smell of it, although that occasionally puts me off a bit because it does contain fish. Some cans are stinkier than others, but it's all perfume to Marie's nose. She gobbles it up. I do vary her diet to include some grain-free products, but this is the food she gets most excited about.<br /><br />I love it because I trust this company, and I believe that Newman's Own products are of high quality. (I hope I'm right.) I also like their mission to bring good green and fair trade products to the market, and to use their profits to support charitable causes. Bottom line: I feel confident that I am giving my girl something wholesome and good.<br /><br />I stock up on this food because the chicken they put in it is "human grade." I hope the fish is "human grade," too, because I have several cases of this in my garage. I'm thinking that when the "Big One" (earthquake) hits here in California, I'll just break out a case of this food and Marie and I can both survive on it until help arrives.

review/summary: My Yorkies love this stuff!
review/text: After researching the ingredients on my dogs' old dog food (Beneful & Cesars),I wanted to get my pups on some healthier food and I also did not want to break the bank doing so. This turned out to be a great alternative that met all my nutritional and financial requirements I had set forth. For a well rounded nutritional meal, I mix the following <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK339Y">Newman's Own Organics Chicken & Brown Rice Formula for Dogs, 12.7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PMDYZA">Newman's Own Organics 100% Organic Liver for Dogs, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK33C6">Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 7-Pound Bag</a>. The dogs really go nuts for this stuff and seem to enjoy it. It appears to me that the dogs have more energy and are in an overall better mood. One of Yorkies had a licking issue and that behavior has decreased dramatically since I made the switch to Newman's. It keeps their stool very solid as well. Overall this a great, nutritional meal at a good price......5 STARS!

review/summary: Turkey and Chicken Formula smells like fish
review/text: Unless you read the fine print, you won't know that "Turkey & Chicken Formula" actually contains turkey, chicken AND whitefish.  Upon opening a can, you immediately get a hint of something fishy--perhaps this is why others have reported the food as "contaminated".  After just a single 5.5 oz can, my dog had a serious case of fish breath and by the next day was occasionally passing fishy-smelling gas.  Don't get me wrong---my dog loved this food, and I have read enough reviews to be satisfied that it's very good quality.  I have no doubt he would love to gobble down more of this (and I've got another 23 cans to get through), but I don't think my family will appreciate more of the fishy smell.

review/summary: Too Rich for my dogs
review/text: I think this is a very good food but as little as I fed daily (about 1 tablespoon) to my dobie and Dogue de Bordeaux, they both had terrible gas and then went into diarrhea, making several trips outside in a panic more than 5x's a night. They were kind enuf to wake me up! I can use it a couple of times a week and that is it. I think if you buy the Newmans's chicken/rice organic canned and the plain beef and mix them up once in a while it would be better, but feeding the "organ" meat daily is a mistake. Maybe your dog will be fine with it, but be careful. My little shih tzu had no problems, but just like the BARF diet they generally only feed organ meats a few x's a week and maybe this was my mistake. So personally I feel it is a good food, just be careful as it is much richer than most any other canned food you will feed and a tablespoon goes a long way!

review/summary: My picky eaters love it!
review/text: I have two Yorkies that are very picky eaters.  After a period of 2-3 days up to 2-3 weeks they will decide they don't like the food I am giving them and just stop eating.  I went through a real struggle when one of them got a stomach bug and got real sick with vomiting and diarrhea.  I started cooking fresh turkey with brown rice and his stomach healed up in no time.  But them I couldn't get them back onto dog food!!  I found the Newman's Organic Turkey and Brown Rice formula and they LOVE it.  I still give them a good quality dry food for little snack times.  However, they usually wait for their turkey and rice and gobble it up.  They have lots of energy and for the last two months have not gotten tired of the food.  I think we have found a keeper!

review/summary: Good food but...
review/text: I do think this is a good food.  However, it is just too mushy to serve alone.  I give the feline version to my cats and they love it, but cats don't mind a softer food.  We give our little poodle canned food for the low carbs and since our cats love Newmans we thought we would try it for him.  First I got it in the big cans, which is enough for 2 days for Joey and I was OK with that.  The first can I used was OK, not great, but OK when I opened the can and gave him the top 3 ounces.  His dinner with the second 3 ounces wasn't as good.  Next day it was even mushier in the second half of the can.  I liked the food though and he did well on it so I ordered the smaller cans to see if there would be a difference there.  I used half of a can this morning for his breakfast and it was OK, but not stiff enough to make it easy for me to chop up and him to eat.  I am going to use this food as a mixer with his Tiki dog food until it is used up and then I don't think I will buy it again.  I don't get it either because it is the same 78% moisture as his California Natural and By Nature dog food but it just doesn't hold up.  I will continue to give it to my cats in their rotation, but little Joey will be sticking to his other good foods.

review/summary: My dogs love this stuff from Uruguay
review/text: OK, I admit, if this hadn't been offered during an Amazon lightning deal I would not have bought it due to the high price.  However, this morning I opened a can to use for one of my dog's medicines.  Each of our three dogs got one-third of a can.<br /><br />And oh my, all three woofed it down and waited for more.  Even the cat chimed in and wanted some.  My dogs don't get this excited over canned Pedigree, which is what I usually feed them as a supplementary food source.<br /><br />Although the pureed liver comes out of the can looking and feeling like something that comes out of the back end of a dog, it doesn't smell offensive.  I'm just not used to these more organic ingredients:  liver, beef broth, minerals and vitamins.  This is definitely something I will buy more often for special meals.<br /><br />Interestingly, this product comes from Uruguay.

review/text: I bought a case just to try out on my wiener dog, Oscar.  He has lost weight.  Now he is much more energetic and can jump higher which means he can get into more trouble.  Before going up stairs was slow and sometimes I had to wait. Now he is the first up the stairs just like the old days.  Keeping weight off of Dachshunds is very important for their back.  It costs a little more but I think I will make it up in vet bills and also have my buddy around for a longer period.<br />Doesn't have that dog food smell and you can actually see the ingredients.

Bottom line, we were feeding her, but our vet compared it to us eating spaghettios every day for every meal for life.<br /><br />Demodex is not contagious but inherited and a skin disorder we had to treat.  We talked to our vet about her immune system and how we would want to keep her as healthy as possible during treatment and after.  While he didn't really recommend any particular brand, he did encourage us to educate ourselves about what's out there.<br /><br />After some research and with the idea that we buy Newman's Own brand foods for our human selves, we ordered the dry kibble and mixed it with the active dog and puppy formula canned food they make as well.  Our dog does love this food, and clearly prefers the canned to the her old cheap foil top square packages we'd pick up each grocery visit.  We have noticed that her fur, while always been soft, has become thick and buttery soft when you pet her.<br /><br />I know the vet warned us that the treatment might have adverse effects, but she has been fine.  I credit a healthier diet for getting her through this.  And it clearly has done wonders for her skin and coat.  Added bonus, the food actually smells good with minimal odor as opposed to the cheapy stuff which made me gaggy.

review/text: I feed my dog nothing but Newman's products.  Before I got her from a bunch of college kids she had subsisted on cheap dog food and cheap fast food.  Did she wolf down the Newman's the first time I gave it to her? No.  Just like us, it took time to retrain her palate and appreciate the lack of salt and msg, artificial flavors and colors, and to relearn better eating habits.  Two years down the road, she is allergy free, healthy, energetic and has a beautiful coat.<br />Highly recommended.

review/text: I have this on automatic shipping once a month.  It's great to have a case of dog food on hand to jazz up the kibble.  We board labs and goldens in our home so sometimes dogs need a little something extra to make the food special enough to eat.  This does the trick.  And it's a high quality canned dog food too.  Far better than carting a case or even 1/2 dozen cans from the supermarket.  Love having it shipped right to my door, having it discounted and no shipping charge through Subscribe and Save.

I am also a firm believer in feeding the best grain free diet to my Labs, and 95% organic beef went well with that.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the product is disgusting.  The consistency of what comes out of the can is disturbing.  Try to imagine dried out peanut butter that is impossible to separate or spread.  No amount of water that I added would allow me to use a fork (and knife) to try to separate the product and mix it with my dry kibble.<br /><br />Instead, I am trying the new Castor & Pollux Organix Grain Free product, and hoping for the best.<br />[...]

My yellow lab is bad with any grains and causes her to have asthma attacks (really, really bad attacks).  Tried this first time last night and she woke up coughing and wheezing.  WTF I thought and sure enough, it has oat bran in it.  My stupid dumb ***, I trust Newman's to have a product accurately reflecting the products on the label.  Brown rice and chicken aren't oats.  I guess my lesson learned is trust no one and read all the labels (actually did before i bought, must have missed it though). I didn't miss it,but Amazon has proven they are wonderful when it comes to taking care of their customers if they feel there was an error or communication problem.  I will continue to use Amazon for most of my shopping, given the incredible value of unlimited 2 day shipping for $75/year

review/summary: Rich, complex, delicious, very pure ingredients and low in caffeine:  what's not to love?
review/text: I consume a lot of this tea on a daily basis while at work.  If you are trying to find a good coffee substitute, this is great because it is very low in caffeine, yet very strong, rich and complex in flavor.  I am sensitive to caffeine, yet this tea does not get me too wired.  It does, however, give me a gentle jazzy infusion of energy.  My personal fave thing to do, tea-wise, is to COMBINE a bag of this kukicha tea with a bag of pure peppermint tea (I favor Celestial Seasonings Pure Peppermint, which has peppermint as the sole ingredient and it is a very strong peppermint) and let them steep together:  VUNDERBAR!  You get a tea with unexpected chocolate overtones that is very delicious, strong and complex.  But back to the straight Haiku kukicha experience:  to sum up, if you are looking for a strong, pure (organic, as a matter of fact) green tea that is heavy on depth and flavor and low in caffeine, you have found it.  ENJOY!

review/summary: Excellent healthy delicious organic soup base! Great for kids!
review/text: A friend told me about this product. She is very health-conscious when it comes to food for her kids. One of her kids has allergy, so she has also been looking for good gluten free food products. She first found this line of soup base in a high-end food store in the East Coast and tried it out. Her whole family loved (and still loves) it. She sent me one as gift a few months ago and we tried it out and my kids love it too. We used to boil meat and vegetable or 2-3 hours and used the soup to cook food for the kids. This was very time and energy consuming. We tried other soup bases in the past but the kids complained about being very thirsty after drinking those. This one is great. It saves us a lot of work and the kids still get healthy delicious soup! I recently found it on Amazon & bought 5 different flavors. The order arrived within 2 days with my Amazon Prime membership and we now can enjoy the different flavors.

review/summary: No perfumed sissy teas for me ;-)
review/text: I have been a tea drinker since I was a baby. In fact, I cannot remember a day of my life without at least one hot cup of tea... And so, it is no wander that I am continuously on a quest for a better tasting leaf.<br /><br />As of lately, my choice has been the Black Pearl. Its fairly recent appearance on supermaket shelves has saved me from frequent trips to a not-so-local tea boutique. The Black Prearl is en excellent choice for those who, like myself, enjoy the brew without the addition of taste masking ingredients, such as lemon, sugar, or milk.<br /><br />The leaves are large (tea dust in the bag is an indicatour of inferiour quality). They brew a liquid that is golden in color (make sure your tea cup is white to enable you to admire it), strong but sweet in taste (unlike most Lipton brands that brew too dark and bitter for my liking), and an aroma that is true to the taste (be patient and allow it to develop; too short a brew=no aroma; too long=bitter taste).<br /><br />The Black Pearl presentation, a fabric piramid, is an added bonus, especially if you are brewing directly in a cup, or a transparent tea pot. My suggestion is to always use a tea pot as it lengthens the experience and allows for a better water to leaf ratio manipulation (quick tip regarding water: OVERboiling removes oxygen and prevents the maximization of flavour!).<br /><br />Sip and enjoy!<br /><br />PS: The price I have paid for this product on Amazon thru Subscribe and Save is HALF of what the supermarket charges! Go, Amazon!

review/text: Let me start by saying I do not find regular Lipton tea very good, kind of like the Budweiser of teas, average, inexpensive, and easy to find (two stars at best).  I read a review of teas a while back, and Black Pearl got great reviews, so when it turned up on the grocer's shelf I had to try it.  The flavor is OK, clean and fresh, not the bold flavor the reviewer gave it.  While it is far better than regular Lipton tea, it is not anywhere close to the english tea that I prefer, Whittard English Breakfast.  I was going to give it three stars because it lacked the bold flavor I was looking for. But taking into account the price and ability to obtain easily, I give it four stars.

review/text: I've drank many teas over the years and have always been a lover of Lipton teas but this one is absolutely exceptional.  For my taste, this is the perfect tea.  It is very much like the original Lipton Tea with a blend of orange pekoe and black cut pekoe, but this variety is somewhat stronger and smoother than the regular Lipton.  It is not too tanic and the infusion provided by the pyramid style bags is much better than the traditional tea bag.  This tea costs a bit more than the regular Lipton variety, but compared to many other brands, this one is a great value and in my estimation it is the best tasting.  I really couldn't be more pleased with it.

review/text: Both my wife and I are heavy users of tea and seldom does a day go by that both of us does not consume several cups of the stuff.<br /><br />Now right from the start I will tell you that neither of us are what you would call "tea snobs."  We are not tea experts nor do we have any brand locality what so ever.  We have lived in and used tea from several different countries and cultures, but to be frank, this makes little difference to us.  We do brew a lot of our teas when possible as we do feel that no matter what tea we drink, brewing the loose leaf yourself gives a better flavor...something that in all likelihood is all in our heads.  But that being said, we simply do not have time to go through the process, and most of the time heating a cup of water in the microwave and dunking in a tea bag is our general mode of preparation.<br /><br />Anyway, we have recently started using this Black Pearl by Lipton and found it to be quite satisfactory.  The taste is good and not overwhelming.  We like the pyramid style bags.  I only add a bit of sweetener to my tea with no cream, etc.  The flavor of this tea comes through quite well.  Large leaf tea is used which is far superior (In my opinion) to that of the ground up stuff you find in many traditional commercial tea bags.<br /><br />The tea taste is strong but there is no bitterness and the stuff actually smells like tea as you are preparing it.  The color is very nice; a rich brown and again, it actually looks like tea with not of the clouded look you so often find.<br /><br />Right now (by my very informal inventory), at least 18 different teas in our stash and that is not counting the dozens of different herbal teas my wife enjoys.  We like variety.  Right now we are using this Black Pearl...who knows what it will be next week?<br /><br />For us this is good stuff; we like it and it will be a part of our tea regimen.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

Easy to oversteep and make bitter, I didn't like it the first time I drank it, but the second time I just didn't brew it as long. I Think the mistake I made was trying to make it get dark, it doesn't get dark, just develops a richer color. I save caffinated teas for in the morning to drink instead of coffee sometimes, makes me feel more hydrated. I think it has plenty of flavor, but, then again I'm not crazy about really strong teas.

Wow can't believe I have stayed with this brand for so long.  I have it on auto ship.  The quality control has improved tremendously.  So no split bags in several years.  And the tea is still good quality.  I would recommend it for convenience and quality.  Still does not match some of the better loose leaf teas, but I only have time for that on the weekends.

review/summary: Good, for American tea
review/text: While Lipton seems to have borrowed the pyramid shape idea from PG Tips, they have improved on the concept of the triangular bag.  This mesh bag allows for more water to pass through and for the tea drinker to observe the handsome, long leaves.  Black Pearl's taste is strong by American standards and definitely the best thing Lipton has going.  Tazo's Awake boasts a more distinctive flavour, but either choice is a pleasant surprise for the supermarket shelves.

review/summary: Good tea in cool looking bag
review/text: I tried this tea recently and It tasted just fine. It tasted better to me than they're regular black tea, but I have tasted other brands that have tasted just as good as this too. I wish the bags were sealed to prevent them from gradually losing their flavor though. You can use a mesh screen tea ball to do the same thing with loose tea, if you dont wanna pay extra for the pyramids.

review/text: This is a most excellent everyday tea. From a fine full bodied iced tea in the warm/hot summer months to a soul warming tea in the winter, this is an excellent tea. I enjoy it in the afternoons during a tea break  when I can collect my thoughts and relax a while. Not at all bitter and full of flavour and strong enough to please even my taste.

review/text: I am crazy about black tea.  I spend way too much money searching out great black teas.  Also, I loved Lipton as a child.  It's too boring for me now, but I still have the memory of my love for it and that makes me smile upon Lipton.  I was excited to try this tea, but it was a disappointment.  It's a decent tea, but just bland and boring.  The words "black pearl" lured me in, but it's really just a decent grocery store tea.

review/text: this tea appears to be regular orange pekoe( mid grade -to low grade tea), totally not worth the money.<br /><br />  However the worst part about this tea is due to the plastic bags in which the tea is packed. Lipton apparently assumes that someone wants to drink plastic with their tea... I ended up cutting up the bags and using it as loos leaf tea.<br /><br /> Lipton's other varieties taste slightly better, for example their Bavarian black forest variety, beware of the plastic bags though. -

review/summary: a tea that will impress all tea-drinkers!
review/text: We first tried Black Pearl at my parents' house and we fell in love. As they were preparing the tea, they said how great it was, but we assumed the were exaggerating since, after all... you can get this at any grocery store.<br /><br />Then our tastebuds were in heaven as we slurped down every last drop of this exceptional tea! Think of your favorite black tea. This is probably 30 times better. It has a very deep dark flavor that often gets lost in some of the cheaper brands of bagged tea.<br /><br />It is definitely worth the price difference, and buying it through subscribe and save is a great deal!! This is the tea you pull out for your tea-lovers! It really hits the spot each time we brew. (4 minutes of brew time)... We also sweeten our tea and for me,  it just enhances the flavors!!<br /><br />If you like a darker, savory black tea give this one a try and you'll never turn back!!

Unfortunately the tea I had at the hotel was very expensive so I looked for a more affordable option and this one was great. I found this product online first but found out it is a little less in the store. None the less this is a great product and I would recommend it.

review/text: I'm more into the herbal teas, but I have a friend who really enjoys the black teas, and Lipton's Black Pearl is his particular favorite. We can't find it in stores anymore, so he was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.com. I ordered two boxes, which will last him quite some time, but they're wrapped well and have an expiration date well into the future, so there's no risk of it going stale before use.

review/summary: A cut above the usual black tea
review/text: I took a chance and signed up to receive shipments of this tea and after tasting my first brewed bag today, I'm glad that I did.  I drink a lot of tea at work and I've tried a bunch of different varieties.  Recently a coworker went on a trip to China and brought back loose leaf black tea from there that cost roughly $1 per cup.  This tea is at least the equal of that, I actually did a blind taste test and couldn't identify which tea was which.<br /><br />The flavor of the tea is strong and very, very smooth.  I usually brew a second cup from each tea bag and even the second cup was not the slightest bit bitter and almost as flavorful as the initial brew.  I never add anything to my black tea, I just drink it straight, and these Lipton bags are definitely the best quality and value I've found.<br /><br />The tea bags themselves appear to by nylon and are very high quality.  The tea leaves inside are fairly large, and as a result little to no debris is left in the bottom of the cup when done.  This is a great tasting tea with no downside I can see.

review/text: I was excited to see a reasonably priced pyramid shaped teabag by Lipton.  Previous experience with this concept in teabag design was very postitive, rich-tasting.  This paricular product fell flat in the taste department.  If it didn't turn the water brown, I'd swear there was no tea in it.  Even two teabags in the cup failed to produce noticeable flavor.  I'm doubling them up anyway now just to finish off the case.

review/summary: Average taste, bad bags
review/text: For something as alluring as the "black pearl" name, I really didn't find much difference between this tea and the mass bulk lipton tea packs. I'd say the only difference is the size of the leaves, which are bigger for this tea.<br /><br />However, the bags for some reason are poor quality despite each bag having a much higher unit price compared to the bulk one. Three times I've had leaves leak out and go into my tea and I've noticed that there are leaves in the box from another ripped bag. Maybe I just got unlucky, but I like my tea leaf-free. I'd give it 3 stars for average taste, 1 star for bag quality, so it averages out to 2.

review/summary: The Real Black Pearl:  An Adventure Tale
review/text: Lipton Black Pearl Tea.  Ahhhh.  Now only a bloody fool would equate Black Pearl with Pirates and the Caribbean, which no doubt is equated to that hack Jerry Bruckheimer and that hack corporation with that sissy mouse.  Truth be told, the Black Pearl refers to something far darker and ominous.  The Black Pearl refers not to fanciful Yankee fairy tales, but rather to our journey's aboard the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish in the winter of 1935 searching for unimaginable riches deep in the jungles of Ceylon.<br /><br />His Majesty's Empire had controlled Ceylon since the early 19th century, captured from the cowardly Dutch.<br /><br />The rotten scoundrel, Sir Algernon Mitford-Freeman, our commanding officer in his Majesty's Royal Navy, had requisitioned us to seek out the elusive Black Pearl.  The Black Pearl, also known as "La Peregrina", was perhaps the most famous pearl in all the world.  You see, it was nicknamed the Black Pearl, because of the heavy curse believed to be carried by the one who claimed ownership on her.  British reconnaissance, the finest in all the oceans, had reason to believe the Black Pearl was somewhere in Ceylon.<br /><br />First Mate Tignor and myself had met with E.F.L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax, 20th Viceroy and Governor-General of India, and the current Chancellor of the University of Oxford, who told us the tale of the Black Pearl.  It was found by a slave in the 1500's in Panama, and made it's way to the Spanish crown.  Prince Phillip II gifted the Black Pearl to his wife, Mary Tudor as a wedding gift.  It passed down to Queen Margarita and Queen Isabella until it found it's way to Napoleon Bonaparte, the diminutive Frenchman.  We departed for Ceylon, as Sir Algernon Mitford-Freeman sent word to Sir Reginald Edward Stubbs, Governor of Ceylon, of our impending arrival.<br /><br />I was below deck, plotting our course, when my rigid focus was disturbed with the boisterous yell of First Mate Tignor.<br /><br />"MAN OVERBOARD!", bellowed First Mate Tignor, without nary a hint of his youthful effervescence.<br /><br />I carefully secured my tea, (truly a travesty to spill or waste a cup of Earl Grey), darted out the Captain's quarters, and scrambled upon deck.<br /><br />"STATUS UPDATE!", I yelled.<br /><br />"Skipper, Mr. Micklegal has gone over, Mr. Constance has already gone in after him.", First Mate Tignor responded.  "Skipper, there's Hammerheads in thems waters," his voice quivered with a sullen terror.<br /><br />I pulled my Bagh Nakh dagger I received as a gift from Maratha Emperor Shivaji as a gift of rescuing his beloved daughter three summers prior and secured it within my grip.  I removed by coat, and dove into the temperate waters of the Gulf of Mannar.  I saw Boson's Mate Micklegal and Helmsman Constance treading water about fifteen meters past the starboard hull.  Circling them with efficient precision, were four great Hammerheads.  I held my breath, dove under, and kicked mightily towards the first beast.<br /><br />With one fell swoop, the dagger plunged within the first Hammerhead's eye, hastening it's retreat further into the depths.  The second Hammerhead never knew what hit him, as the dagger came down upon it's head.  The third hammerhead received a similar fate.  The last remaining Hammerhead snapped around and headed straight towards me.  One snap of it's jaw and the Hammerhead bit down into the flesh of my left arm.  Pain coursed through my body, but than I was taken over by pure British rage.  As the Hammerhead tried to drag me into the depths, and a glorious death fit for song and tale, I drove the dagger deep within it's gill slit, silencing the water dragon.<br /><br />I found Boson's Mate Micklegal, apparently unconscious in the water, grabbed him, and swam him back to the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish.  Helmsman Constance, ever the gallant swimmer, made his way back to the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish as well, two perished Hammerheads in tow, a fine meal.  Midshipman Householder yanked us topside with all his might.  Midshipmen Householder gave a swift kick with his boot into the ribcage of Boson's Mate Micklegal.  Boson's Mate Micklegal coughed up the sea and awoke.<br /><br />"Sorry Captain", he exclaimed.<br /><br />"Glad to have you back Boson's Mate Micklegal", I replied, "Earl Grey is not the same without you."<br /><br />We recouped on deck and reset our course to Ceylon.<br /><br />It was days later when First Mate Tignor threw the anchorline of the bow and bellowed, "Anchoring Skipper, time to prepare the longboat".  The recon crew of Boson's Mate Micklegal, First Mate Tignor, Midshipman Householder and myself lowered ourselves into the longboat, and set ashore Ceylon.  Our intel had informed us that the village of Nuwara Eliya, at the foothills of Mount Pidurutalagala where the Indian Tamil people lived, was where the Black Pearl resided, after one of His Majesty's Royal Caravan's had been raided on the way to Colombo.  Intel also informed us that the Indian Tamil's were potentially hostile, so our crew proceeded with a high degree of focus.<br /><br />"Captain, the First Earl of Halifax also mentioned great fields of tea leaves 'round these parts", whispered Boson's Mate Micklegal.  "Says they rival even the best Earl Grey the King has to offer."<br /><br />The backside of my gloved hand came speeding across Boson's Mate Micklegal's cheek with deadly precision carrying with it a loud pop.  Boson's Mate Micklegal stumbled back.  "I am truly disappointed in such wretched tomfoolery Micklegal.  Every fine upstanding Englishman knows that Earl Grey is the finest tea in all His Majesty's land, and is truly, the tea of Kings."<br /><br />"Sorry Captain", Micklegal offered, his cheek flushed red.  We pressed on to Nuwara Eliya.<br /><br />We arrived at the rear end of a grand estate, where the Indian Tamil leader had taken up command.  Midshipman Householder threw the grappling hook up onto the second floor balcony.  Boson's Mate Micklegal stood watch as Midshipman Householder, First Mate Tignor and myself ascended up the rope.  We pulled ourselves upon the regal balcony, which was eerily silent.  We entered the room with silent precision.  As Midshipman Householder, on point, traveled around the west corridor, he encountered a guard.  Midshipman Householder slid behind the guard, grasped his shoulder and slid his cutlass under the guard's neck.  "You'll tell me where the Black Pearl is, or I'll bleed you, you fool", Midshipman Householder whispered.<br /><br />"Fourth bedroom on the left," whispered the guard, "the woman is wearing it".  With a a little amount of pressure applied, the guard fell haplessly asleep.<br /><br />We entered the fourth bedroom on the left and were taken aback by the pint-sized Punjabi woman clenching a Pata sword, the elusive pearl dangling from her neck.<br /><br />"Put down your sword my lady, and you'll live another day", I declared.<br /><br />"Put down your sword, and you'll live another day", she replied.<br /><br />"M'am, I am stronger than you, I am faster than you, and I am a significantly superior swordsman."<br /><br />"Sir, I am stronger than you, I am faster than you, and I am a significantly superior swordswoman."<br /><br />"M'am, if you do not lay down your sword, and hand over the pearl that is hanging from your neck, I will not hesitate to strike"<br /><br />"Sir, if you do not lay down your sword, and hand over the pearl that is hanging from your neck, I will not hesitate to strike."<br /><br />I was getting extremely frustrated, "M'am, there is no pearl hanging from my neck, as you can clearly see, and at this point, I believe you are simply restating my words and modifying them for the appropriate gender.  We come to do no harm to you, we only seek to return the Black Pearl to it's rightful owner", I said exasperated.<br /><br />The Punjabi woman began talking at high pitch speeds which were near impossible to follow.  She jumped around thrusting her Pata blade in my direction.  After a few parry's, I picked up a rock, which she promptly hit.  Momentarily dazed, I picked up the Punjabi woman and tossed her to Midshipman Householder, the brawns of the operation.  The Black Pearl in our possession, we descended down the rope, but Boson's Mate Micklegal was nowhere to be found.  Puzzled, we debated our next move.<br /><br />The ground began to shake uneasily.  We all whipped our heads around and saw Boson's Mate Micklegal in a full sprint, arms flailing.  We could barely hear him, but could make out the words on his lips... "RUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!".<br /><br />Before we could put the thoughts in our heads together, we saw upon the horizon hundreds of Indian Tamil's running full speed to our location.  Instinctively, we all joined Boson's Mate Micklegal in a mad dash towards the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish.  Midshipman Householder had the Punjabi woman over his shoulder.  Arrows flew by our heads as we ran towards a future that we know longer knew whether it existed.  With English luck, we arrived at the longboat and pushed off as a final arrow flew by First Mate Tignors left shoulder.<br /><br />Aboard the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish, we asked Boson's Mate Micklegal what had happened.<br /><br />"You see Captain, as a fine and accomplished teasmith, I could not leave such savage land without the most exquisite tea of which the First Earl of Halifax had spoken of many months ago.  I was picking some leaves from the fields, pure long leaf quality black tea you see, when one of the savages saw me, cursed at me in a beastly language.  I pulled my cutlass and was givin' him a good ole English talking to, when alls of a sudden, them savages multiplied by twenty.  So I gathered the pure long leaf quality black tea, and ran back, which is when I saw all yous mates, and you Captain."<br /><br />As I told Boson's Mate Micklegal I was glad he was safe, and that we had rescued the Punjabi woman and recovered the Black pearl, we began to celebrate on the deck of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish.  With the Punjabi woman locked away in the brig, the men drank and sang victory hymns throughout the night.  Boson's Mate Micklegal pulled up his trusty kettle and brewed us the pure long leaf quality black tea, and we had a fine cup of tea.  (Though, certainly not as fine as "The Earl").  The tea was fit to be named after the Black Pearl itself.<br /><br />The morning we set sale, Punjabi woman in tow (for as memory serves, was not the end of her involvement with our journeys), for jolly ole' England and riches we were promised.  Unfortunately, we were unable to share the joyous Black Pearl tea with the First Earl of Halifax, nor our countrymen, because Boson's Mate Micklegal, with a bottle of Glen Fiddych he found somewhere on Ceylon and stashed in the hold, had consumed way too much of the Glen Fiddych, and rolled the remaining pure long leaf quality black tea into cigarettos and offered them to the entire crew.<br /><br />I missed that strong and distinct flavored pure long leaf quality black tea for many, many years, until the Hack's at Lipton brilliantly recreated this intense and earth masterpiece.  So top of the morning to the folks of Lipton, and to the memories of that winter of 1935, this one goes out to you!

review/summary: Stanley wants seconds!
review/text: Stanley may not be the best source for food reviews, since he generally eats anything he can fit into his mouth and seems to enjoy it, but the fact is, he is very fussy about dog food.  I've tried the high priced stuff, Royal Kanin, Iams, even Paul Newman's offering which smells better than the stuff I feed myself.  He eats it, of course, but not joyfully, not with that Cocker Spaniel enthusism.  Plainly put, when Stanley eats something he loves, he sends up a spray and every fiber of his doggy being exudes joy.  Yeah, I know, so do I, thanks for bringing it up in front of strangers.  We're talking about the dog, so beat it.<br /><br />Anyway, until now, only people food...but specially prepared for Stanley (vet approved menu: chicken or beef, baked boiled or broiled, fat removed, diced and mooshed together with selected fresh vegetables)...elicited this kind of enthusiasm. I am not averse to cooking for my dog, but it would be nice to be able to open up a can every so often instead. Particularly when there is only one piece of chicken left and I want it.  A friend told me that his finicky dog loved Purina, to the exclusion of all other canned offerings, so I tried it.  Country Stew, Lamb and Rice and this "Gravy with Beef" which sounds unappetizing, but smells fine, are his favorites.  He still prefers a nice piece of beef and has absolute and undisputed dibs on the white meat from every chicken, but this rates a ten on his tail-wagging unbridled joy of eating scale.<br /><br />I should point out that Stanley also eats bugs when he can get them, so while the word "choosy" might describe his eating habits, so does disgusting.  But no matter, he's the best Good Boy ever and deserves the best...whether it's people food, dog food or the occasional crawly thing.

review/summary: Purchased Pedigree Cuts in Gravy with Chicken Food for Dogs
review/text: Have purchaed through Subscribe and Save through Amazon.com the Pedigree Choice Cuts in Gravy with Chicken Food for Dogs, 13.2 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24) and our dog prefers this flavor over repeatedly and I will always give it 5 Stars!  This flavor has  Chicken in cube bite size with gravy that is just yummy.  Our dog wags his tail the second he sees the can and so enjoys his meal which means the bowl is clean when done! Our pets know when they are being served the best. High recommendation.

review/summary: Our dogs love it but finding low price and 12 oz cans is tough
review/text: When Amazon LLC was selling large cans it was affordable via super saving shipping.  You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.  Our dogs love the pedigree brand pouches and cans, especially the beef and liver.  Although, they use corn product (one reviewer noted) and my veterinarian espouses "...it's mostly water," our dogs vote is positive.  We treat our pets and give this to them because they like it...not for their health.<br /><br />After finding the substantial price increase this morning, I found the small cans at PetCo.  Perhaps, Amazon will get a small can supplier for the "beef and liver" chunks in the future.

review/summary: poor taste
review/text: Just when i got my shipment i tried it out on my pit but he only ate portion of it and he never ate it after that. So i also tried it on my rottweiler and she does not like it also. The only way they would eat it is if i add some caned meat with it then they would, but that shouldn't be the case. so i don't recommend.

review/summary: Pedigree Dog Food, why I give if 5 Stars
review/text: I have a four year old dog who loves Pedigree Canned Dog food.  We have been using it the last six months.  I have purchased some of the most expensive canned dog foods at a local pet store and he will not eat the stuff.  If I have a bag of high quality kibbles and mix it in with the Pedigree, he will not eat his food.  We tried Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Eagle Pack, Holistic Select, Innova, Merrick, and Natural Balance.  I don't know what is in these higher quality cans of dog food he does not like.  Maybe too many vegetables??  He will even hide and pout if I put that stuff in front of him.  One time I left the food out for 15 min., put it away, and tried the next day.  He just would not eat the food.  He just loves the smell and taste of Pedigree, and he will even eat Alpo on occasion, but he will not eat the expensive dog foods, which I am more than willing to purchase for him.  I talked to two vets about this.  They tell me dogs go by odor.  The worse something smells the more they like it.  This is why many dogs will roll in dead things out of doors.  We do try to balance out his diets with apples, carrots, etc., if he will eat them, plus the dog gets a vitamin with minerals each day.  Of course he will eat cooked meat if I give it to him, and often we will give this to him with some rice or whole wheat pasta mixed in.  If someone can tell me how to get him to eat the better canned or kibble dog food that so many folks think dogs should be on, then I would like to know this.  Also, the reason we started using Pedigree is because we have some friends (and their relatives) who have had many dogs over the years and feed them Pedigree.  These dogs have lived to a ripe old age.  The biggest thing that got them down was arthritis, but the Pedigree never killed them.  So, this dog food may not be high quality, which I agree when compared to Blue Buffalo, etc., but it does not seem to affect their life span.  I am sure there will be folks who will tell me differently, but for those folks I know personally, they have not found any problems with this food for their dogs.  Amen.

review/summary: Delivered to the door right on schedule
review/text: What a great way to get heavy items like dog food from an affordable and dependable source. I usually by my dog food in a discount box store rather than my local grocery store. That means another trip and more than once, I've run out. With gas prices what they are the convenience and one less trip is well worth looking into having stock items delivered this way.

review/summary: MY PUG WONT EAT ANYTHING ELSE
review/text: My 9 1/2 year old pug seems to have developed a senesitive stomach as he got older and lost some teeth.. So I had to put him on some soft food that would not upset his tummy.. I bought these for him and Thought he was gonna eat right thru the bowl the 1st time I put it out for him.. Needless to say he absoutly loves his food! and it seems to agree with his tummy.

review/summary: The dogs won't eat it!
review/text: My two dogs turn their noses up at this flavor dog food.<br />Even Mikey who eats anything when fed with the other dog won't touch it.<br />I don't understand why as the texture of the food looked fine and I hadn't noticed any usual smell to it.<br />There was some left over steak that I cut up into little bits and put in with the food and they managed to get the pieces out and leave the food.<br />Needless to say I am trying something else to feed them.<br />Other than the dogs not touching the food, it was delivered super fast and cans were all in tack.

review/summary: NEVER! NEVER! NEVER!
review/text: NEVER buy Pedigree. I made a huge mistake trying this. It has the nutritional value of a cardboard box. It's full of corn and by-products. Your dog deserves better than this. If I could give Pedigree a -0, I would. My dog's coat is softer and shinier and she's much more energetic on another brand. There's dog food info all over the NET. Please, steer clear of the ugly Pedigree.

review/summary: Great cup of coffee
review/text: These pods work well with my Simplehuman coffee maker.  And I can get both an 8 oz. cup and an additional 5 ozs out of each pod.  Taste of the mocha cinnamon swirl is balanced and not too sweet.  But do some comparison shopping - if you buy directly from the Java Podz website, the cost of both the pods and the s/h are lower than buying through Amazon!

review/summary: Great Flavor - works for Senseo
review/text: I love the Senseo - it is so easy to use and so easy to clean.  I wanted to replace Starbucks (why pay $4 or more for a cup of coffee) but the Senseo coffee pod flavors did not excite me.  I spent some time googling coffee pods that fit the Senseo.  I like strong flavor, so I ended up buying these and I use two (2) pods for a stronger cup.  I really like these.  The flavor is really great.  I will purchase them again!

review/summary: Javapodz
review/text: We own the Senseo coffee maker and were using the Senseo coffee pods. I was so excited to find the Javapodz flavored coffee. However, they tell you that you only need to use one pod for an 8oz cup, unlike the Senseo coffee where you use 2 pods for an 8 oz cup. After drinking the Senseo, I found the Javapods to be a bit weaker coffee flavor, especially after I add half and half.<br /><br />My remedy to this was to use one Senseo mild pod and one flavored javapod and make a 12 oz cup, by using the 2 cup button and then directly after without changing pods I used the 1 cup button. This works wonderfully for me as I get the stronger coffee taste with the wonderful flavor that Javapodz offers. It makes a super iced coffee as well!<br /><br />The packaging is great. Each pod is foil wrapped so they stay fresh for a long time

review/summary: Got Your Pep and Your Mint Right Here!
review/text: If you can't get to a specialty shop (e.g.candy shop, Cracker Barrel-type-joint) to obtain any type of candy resembling peppermint bark (I never can), then get these suckers. They are at Target, and they do go fast. Not too strong, not white-chocolate-chalky at all, slightly crunchy due to mint specks added by the elves...I just ate one right now in order for reporting purposes, and I feel like I am in the Andes. Without rugby players, of course.
