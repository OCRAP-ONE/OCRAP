review/text: While many believe that A id better than B grade I find the B grade maple syrup very rich.  It has more flavor than the A and is excellent to use in both baking and with roasted fowl and pork.

review/summary: Great Maple Taste
review/text: I bought this 1/2 gallon because I am a big fan of Grade B maple syrup.  Grade B has a more pronounced maple flavor than Grade A syrup.  The price on this syrup is good, and the jug has a flip top, so that you do not have to unscrew the cap to pour a serving.

review/summary: BUYER BEWARE - DON'T BUY FROM NUTRICITY!!!
review/text: If I could put zero stars I would!<br /><br />I purchased two 64-fl oz containers of pure maple syrup from Nutricity through Amazon. The product was fine. Then without ever using it, I decided I wanted to return it for a refund. I printed the return authorization and the shipping label from the Amazon website, paid an extra $15 for shipping, and sent the items back. About two weeks later I got an email from Nutricity stating that their policy is no refunds on grocery items, and if I wanted the product back I would have to pay for shipping back to me. That's fine if that's their policy, but it was not clearly stated, and if that is their policy, I should not have been able to print a return authorization from the Amazon website. I feel like I have been ripped off. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!<br /><br />Save yourself the headache, and just buy this from someone else!

review/summary: See how it stacks up against the others
review/text: This is good syrup and my 2nd favorite.  It has a medium sweetness when compared with the other 2 that I've tried.  I typically don't like things very sweet.  I used 3 syrups listed below for my Master Cleanse.  They are all good quality and I'd recommend any of them.  You probably will want 1 jug for every 5 days of a cleanse.  It is possible that you'll need more.  I'm not an expert to comment on darkness or many other factors.  Here's my brief breakdown:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - The sweetest of the 3 for sure.  It is also probably the thickest but still runny.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  When I put this in my lemonade for the Master Cleanse, it makes the lemonade sweeter than how I like it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ENHSC8">NOW Foods Maple Syrup Grade B Organic, 32 ounce</a> - Is less sweet when compared to Coombs but a little sweeter than Family Heritage.  Runnier than Coombs but these syrups are all a little runnier than grocery syrups.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  It provided the right amount of sweetness for the Master Cleanse specifications for a drink.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248E980">Family Heritage Organic Vermont Maple Syrup, Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - Good quality and tastes sweet but definitely not as sweet as the other 2.  Didn't get the calorie info before throwing the bottle away but I'm figuring it's the same as the other 2.  I usually put an extra 1/2 a tbsp in my master cleanse lemonade to get it a little sweeter and curb the hunger.

review/summary: Adds a dash of magic to breakfast
review/text: This is really good maple syrup, packed with flavor, dense, and dark. Naturally it takes homemade waffles and pancakes to the next level, but it can also add a dash of magic to other breakfast staples, such as oatmeal or muffins. It is hard to imagine how commercial syrups laden with artificial flavors, colors, and other content can even be marketed as syrup---this is the real deal.

review/summary: So much better than Grade A!
review/text: I'm from Maine and I have to tell you that I would never buy grade A maple syrup. If I'm going to use maple syrup, I want that rich, distinctive taste, not something that's barely different than white sugar. That's actually a good comparison - grade A is to grade B as white is to brown sugar. I know we're all used to thinking of "grade A" as meaning of superior quality, but that's not how it works with this. It is referring to the level of filtering/processing the sap goes through. If you want generic sweetness, go grade A. For everything else, grade B. This is a trusted brand of organic syrup with a great flavor. By the way, for baking and real maple syrup afficionados, there is also a grade C (even darker)!

review/text: If you are thinking of doing the Master Cleanse, this is the product you are looking for.  It is reasonably priced, high quality and exactly fits all the specifications they recommend.  One note, if you are going to do the full 10 days you will either need 2 or an additional 32 oz. I personally liked it as a table syrup as well.  It's the "stout" of maple syrups.

The only problem I have found is in the shipping sometimes the plastic cap gets broken even though they pack it well the delivery people most likely have dropped it at some point.  Thats the way it goes sometimes.  Since the jug is sealed it's still usable.

My husband has been wanting pancakes just so he can eat the syrup! I've used it for a Master Cleanse and don't know if it's the quality of the syrup or what, but have had better success with detoxing using this than a Grade A or other brand of Grade B (this is my 3rd MC).  I look forward to using this for breakfast and baking, I will reorder again and recommend to friends and family! It would make a great gift in a gourmet gift basket!

review/text: I have used real maple syrup for years.  When my kids were small I used the standard stuff until I started becoming a label reader, then I could not in good conscience continue to serve a product that amounted to a liquid chemical concoction.  I recently discovered grade B syrup, which has a stronger, more molassas kind of flavor.  Besides the obvious pancakes and french toast, I also use it on oatmeal and in baked goods.  Will continue to purchase.

However, my 8 year old son, whose taste buds have been conditioned to the tune of high fructose corn syrup type syrups, thought the taste was too strong.

review/summary: Definition of NON-GE for this product, from Now Foods. I have not used this item, am just giving definition.
review/text: Non-GE - "GE" stands for genetic engineering and is also referred to as GMO (genetically modified organism). Genetic engineering of food products uses gene splicing to overcome natural boundaries that would otherwise prohibit the creation of a product. Genes from different species can be combined to create a hardier product resistant to certain exogenous factors. As an example, you might be able to add fish genes to corn to make it resistant to pesticides. Although there may be "instant gratification" from such benefits as better taste, longer shelf life, and greater yield, serious concerns exist about the long-term ramifications of using these types of products and ingredients. Until more research backing the safety of GE products is available, we'll continue to make every effort to use only non-GE ingredients and products

review/text: It's grade-B maple syrup. I used it for some Christmas recipes. It was sticky and smelled and tasted of maple, and was (presumably) not made out of some unknown substance that fell to earth, possibly from space. I trust that a health-food company would sell the genuine article so advertised. Perhaps naive of me, but I was willing to take that leap of faith this time.<br /><br />Only gripe: the blue cap arrived broken. There was a silvery plastic seal across the top, much like you would find on a bottle of salad dressing, so the syrup stayed in place. I would not, however, recommend using the syrup as salad dressing. Unless you're into that kind of thing. Not that there's anything wrong with that. You freak.

review/text: I bought this as an add-on to an order. I can see why now. This coffee does not even SMELL like Jamaican Me Crazy in the bag and tastes like good regular coffee when ground and brewed. It is good but has no distinguishable JMC aroma or taste.

review/summary: not our favorite
review/text: We recently purchased seven unsweetened chocolate bars for comparison. The goal was to find an unsweetened chocolate that was so good (to snack on) that it didn't need sugar.  It does exist:  Pralus French 100% Cocoa: Criollo Chocolate.  The Schaffen Berger Unsweetened 99% Cacao Baking Chocolate Bar came in last. Our rankings (which of course reflect out personal tastes) from love to freecycle:  1. Pralus French 100% Cocoa: Criollo Chocolate; 2. Vintage Plantations 100% Cacao Arriba Bar; 3. Michel Cluizel French Chocolate - "Chocolat Noir Infini" 99% Cocoa Dark Chocolate (has more ingredients added); 4. Sunspire 100% Chocolate Bar; and it was difficult to rank the last three as we did not care for them at all - 5. Ghirardeli 100% unsweeteed Chocolate Bar; 6. Callebaut Unsweetened Liquor Chunks Cocoa; 7. Schaffen Berger Unsweetened 99% Cacao Baking Chocolate Bar.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I'm a huge chocolate fan, and I've eaten lots of different brands, ranging from the lower-end Lindt and Ghirardelli to the higher-end Valrhona and Neuhaus. I was frankly disappointed by the taste of this bar, which ended up being extremely dull for a very high cacao content bar. Even Ghirardelli's 100% cacao baking bar had a more exciting fruity flavor. The only redeeming quality of this bar is that it melts extremely smoothly and makes a really thick melting chocolate, which is good for those bakers and candy-makers out there. Not really great for tasting alone.

review/text: I think that this is an ok salsa, I prefer the picante to this by far.  I love the picante, its got more flavor and more juice which I like.  If you are looking for a salsa that is full on chunky style then I would go with this, the taste to me is blander then the picante and leaves a strange taste in your mouth afterwards.  Still a great salsa and I recomend it to anyone looking for a great chip salsa for partys and what have you.  If you want a more liquid salsa then I would go with the picante but again, you like more firm chunk salsa then go with this pace chunky salsa.

review/text: The product description says: "Keta Salmon Caviar is from the select roe of the Keta Salmon, which has very large eggs with a color that can range from bright red to brilliant orange."<br /><br />The caviar I received consisted of really small eggs (about half the size of those at a sushi restaurant) that are mushy, and taste awful. Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them. I had a "taste test" with my cat and dog, who *love* caviar) and they both turned their noses up at it. NOT a good sign.  :-(

review/summary: Don't buy this cheese on line
review/text: I once bought this cheese from a high-end cheese store in the San Francisco area and it was the best cheese I had ever eaten -- crumbly, fragrant of earth and (for some reason) oranges, a deep complex flavor that just kept on giving. I hunted for it in Los Angeles, couldn't find it, finally tracked it down on line at igourmet. What I got was like so-so parmesan: hard and a little oily with no particular flavor. To igourmet's credit, they apologized and gave me a full refund, so I don't blame then. I've since read that the cheese is fragile and very hard to find in its best state, even in Italy. If you love good cheese, put in the effort to find a cheese store that carries this cheese at its best. Unforgettable. But don't try to buy it on line.

review/summary: Good Value , Nice Flavor
review/text: I bought this to flavor coffee.  I don't like sugar in my coffee.  I like the vanilla flavor in coffee but not the sweetness of syrup.<br />This is just right.  I also use Almond or hazel extracts instead of syrup for the same reason.  If you like a flavor boost in the coffee but don't like all the sweetness, a bit of extract is the way to go. And you control how much  flavor to add without any sugar.<br />When I was a kid, my mother would flavor milk with plain vanilla or almond to make it more palatable.  It's a good way to add a touch of flavor and sweet touch without sugar.<br />I use real vanilla extract for baking and custards, but I am sure Mccormick brand imitation vanilla is fine for baking too, just use a little more to taste.  That's the cook's choice.<br />When I make cocoa from real cocoa poweder, I use half the sugar and add this vanilla.  Voila, a hot drink with lots of chocolate flavor but not too sweet.<br />All together, a useful product for me and 32 oz was good value for the money.

review/text: A while back, I ordered one of each of every tea-tree foot/body powder I could find, to try them all out. I was looking for a natural alternative to the various anti-fungal medicated powders I'd been using for athletes-foot and jock-itch.<br /><br />On first glance I was unimpressed by this product. It's rather plain looking, and the label is even kinda wrinkled up like it was badly glued onto the cardboard tube.<br />HOWEVER, after evaluating all of the powders, this one is BY FAR my favorite one!<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice is that it doesn't poof clouds of powder everywhere. Secondly, it has a pleasant tea-tree oil scent - not too strong - just right. It does an excellent job of cooling, relieving itch, and healing and preventing chafing.<br /><br />It is labeled as foot powder, and it does that job well, but it's great for an allover body powder - not too strong even for the "sensitive" areas!

When the dogs have a Red Barn Bully Stick handy, there is no mischief chewing of chair legs, carpets, blankets, and other stuff they like to nibble at.

review/text: I have 3 children with food allergies who are on the Feingold diet. The diet eliminates chemicals, colorings, preservatives, and artificial flavorings and finding "treats" that don't contain any of these "bad guys" is a tall order these days. The most difficult issue is that manufacturers are not required to list ALL of their ingredients on a label if it's less than a certain amount, or can be more broadly categorized (ex. flavorings), or an ingredient was utilized by a secondary manufacturer or in processing (ex. the coating sprayed in a pan to make it non-stick that ends up on the end product). At any rate, the Feingold organization monitors those ingredients NOT on the label, with cooperation from the manufacturers, to help kids who have reactions and allergies. Well, St. Claire's is cooperative with the Feingold organization and these mints are free of the "bad guys". My kids enjoy the heck out of them and it's a fun little treat that I can be happy knowing isn't going to cause an issue for them which means, these will be great for ANYONE to enjoy!!

review/summary: Glucosamine Helps Dog
review/text: Dasuquin was the brand of glucosamine supplement recommended by our vet. Our daughter found the best price on Amazon. It's worked wonderfully well for our dear old dog, a 10 yr old Blue heeler. He soon became less painful, & now has the spring back in his step! We learned from our vet that he can stay on the maintenance dose of 1 chew daily, or increase to 2 chews a day for when he has more activity.

review/summary: A big improvement over hard chews
review/text: It used to be a big challenge to get my dog to eat the hard chews, especially when he was stressed from traveling or around other dogs. Now his supplement is his favorite treat, which has removed a small but daily hassle from my routine. I balked at the price initially, but it's definitely worth the cost for me.

review/summary: It's helping!
review/text: Stella, our mixed-breed rescue dog, was limping quite noticeably, so we took her to the Vets to learn what the problem is.  He told us she has deformities in both front legs, and suggested we try Dasuquin, a supplement for joints.  It took a while, but now she's on her 3rd bag of the product, and her limp is so much better, most of the time it's not even there!  She couldn't tell us if she hurt when she limped, but now that she hardly limps at all, we feel like any pain she might have had, must be greatly relieved.  We will keep Stella on this product because it's proven to help her.  Thanks, Nutramax, for helping our little girl out!

review/summary: Remarkable Product at a Great Price
review/text: My 15-year-old, 50-pound mixed breed has only been on the Nutramax Dasuquin Soft Chews for just under 2 weeks and I'm amazed at how much better he seems to feel already.  He is lying down and getting up more easily and quickly along with walking around with a little more pep in his step.  My 8-year-old Pug, who has shoulder issues, is now walking around without even a hint of the limp she has had for a few years now.  I am encouraged by the progress they are both showing in such a short time and I am quite optimistic this could be the one thing I do for my dogs that greatly improves their quality of life.  The seller had a great price with super fast shipping, I only wish I had bought more at that time.

review/summary: Can't live without it
review/text: I knew this product helped my 5 year old beagle, but I didn't know how much.  My beagle is a rescue and had torn ACLs in both back legs and was unable to jump up when I got him.  They said he couldn't walk far and that he would need surgery.  I took a chance and got him anyway.  Turns out, all he needed was love, someone to spend time with him and Dasuquin.  He takes it every day at his morning meal and though he still needs a running jump to get up on the bed and the sofa, he does it just fine.  He plays and runs and is a little inhibited, but not much.  I ran out a couple of months back and thought I'd pick some up in a few days, wasn't worried about it.  Within three days he started to pee in the house, limp and have no energy.  I won't make that mistake again.  This stuff is worth every penny I spend on it.  Bentley the beagle highly recommends it.

review/summary: Causes diarrhea and foul stools!!!
review/text: We used Dasuquin with MSM with our almost 15 year old Shih Tzu per vet recommendations. After about a week diarrhea began and increased in frequency as time went on. It took a little while to recognize the cause as we had started other medications almost simultaneously but a web search, stopping each medication separately and waiting for the effect proved Dasuquin chews to be the cause.<br />It caused diarrhea about 4-5 hours after administration and extremely foul smelling stools. Numerous inquiries on the web can be found about this. We were not warned by the vet nor does the literature available that we received say anything about it. As it is a supplement versus a regulated medication, there is a typical lack of indications of adverse conditions.<br />As for its effectiveness otherwise, I cannot comment. The dog liked the taste and ate the chews readily but the consequences were terrible!

She started walking after we gave glucosamin/chondroitin to her.  Science Diet has older dog food with both, we feed her that and ....Dasquin really boosted her abilities and was introduced to us by the Vet.  It is interesting to see the price for the same product vary from $34 to $72 though!  You have to search and search to get a reasonable deal.

Needless to say, I returned and will get it from my vet from now on.

review/summary: She'll be 17 on Valentine's Day 2012.
review/text: Our senior lab/springer mix has been declining very slowly thanks to the benefits of glucosamine.  Lately, however, a need for a change has become apparent.  She's about 55 - 60 lbs.  She gets one dose each morning that she gobbles down happily.  Her movement is less restricted and she actually broke into a trot the other day.  What a blessing.  She's right on the cusp of the weight suggestions for this product line so we went with the "under 60 lbs" dose first in order to get her acclimated to the new supplement.  As she is getting used to them and still exhibits discomfort in her hind end we'll be moving her to the "over 60 lbs" dose very soon.

review/summary: Great Preventative Care
review/text: I got this for my 6 year old pomeranian after our vet suggested it not only to prevent his minor luxating patella from becoming worse, but also to strengthen his cartilage to prevent collapsed trachea, which is common in pomeranians.  I tried the tablets, but he wouldn't eat them and I couldn't blame him because they smelled, well, like vitamins.  After trying these chews and having been on them for a little over a month now, I have noticed that he is jumping better and I am noticing less "popping" in his knees.  Considering that he gets half a tablet each day, it will only cost around $60 to give my dog this each year, which is a small price to pay for such a great product!

The only problem I had is that I couldn't clearly find the information on dog size for the product. I ended up getting the Dasuquin for dogs up to 50 pounds and my dog is 85 pounds so I have to give him 2 instead of one. It's no big deal but I will look more closely for that info the next time I purchase it.

Our vet recommended this product along with an explanation of what makes it truly effective.

I hadn't planned on spending this much for either my dog or myself, but am ecstatic about the product efficacy.

My grandchildren love it and ask me to make it for them<br />each time they come.<br /><br />The local chain grocers have replaced their shelf space with another brand which is not nearly as good as Mrs Grass soups.<br />I searched everywhere and even called the company. I finally found it on Amazon and love the 8 pack box.  The chicken soup<br />is also very delicious. I add my own white meat chicken breast, absolutely delicious. Try them all, you won't be disappointed.
