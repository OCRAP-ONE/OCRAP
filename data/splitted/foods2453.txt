review/summary: Gluten Free Pantry Bread Mix...Best By Far!!!
review/text: I have tried several prepackaged Gluten Free Bread Mixes and this is by far the easiest and best tasting of them. I have a daughter with a Gluten allergy and we had hunted for a bread that wasn't like a brick or just awful and crumble apart. This is the one. It is still "gluten free" so its not like Wonder Bread, but it is edible for certain.

review/summary: Simply THE best GF bread anywhere
review/text: I have been cooking and baking as well as buying products that are gluten free for 15 years. This is absolutely the best Gluten free bread I have ever seen , including those available from bakeries or in stores.  I mixed all the ingredients together, not even taking care to beat the eggs separately, etc.  Baked it for an hour. Presto. The best looking best tasting GF loaf we have ever seen. As a bonus, the loaf was a normal size, and much better for slicing for sandwiches. Although we often use storebought (eg Ener-G tapioca), the size of the slices on ready-made GF bread is ridiculously small.<br /><br />More importantly the texture of this bread was perfect. and the bread was totally flexible, no crumbling whatsoever. Sliced up like 'normal' bread, no falling apart.

review/summary: Best yet
review/text: I was diagnosed with Celiac disease last spring and finding gluten free bread that tastes good has been nothing short of a nightmare. I love this mix. It is so easy and versatile. I use it in my bread machine on the gluten free setting and add some extra time on the bake cycle to make sure it's done. I also add about 1TBsp of honey to the wet ingredients to moisten it up a bit.<br /><br />This bread makes delicious deli style sandwiches. No more frozen bread for me!

review/text: I agree with most of the reviews on this bread.  I have been gluten free for 10 years and at first I made my own bread from a recipe from Gluten free gourmet, but when I found Gluten Free Pantry I have made only the sandwich or french bread by GFP with the exception that someone else bought some other brand, one was so bad I used for cold bread pudding.  I just noticed that the new owners have changed the box.  Please leave keep it in the original box.

review/text: The first loaf was a little confusing, but then I caught on! This can be made by oven method or bread machine - both instructions are on the box.  After I mixed it and let it rest I was concerned that it only was as high as the bread pan.  I now know that it will continue to rise in the oven as it bakes.  It cuts well and the taste is the best we have tried.

review/summary: the next best thing to wheat bread
review/text: I was completely surprised by how this turned out!  While it was rising, I was doubtful, but once it cooled and I sliced the bread, I was eager to taste it.  The texture was very much like white wheat bread, and the taste was very delightful!  My 16 month old is allergic to wheat and she loved being able to eat bread again (she has terrible eczema from wheat, tomatoes, dairy, and eggs), but even my 9 year old loved it.  Definitely recommended!  My only complaint is the price! over $6 a loaf including shipping.

review/summary: Better than gluten-full bread!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this bread!  I am the only one in my household with celiac disease and the only one who is gluten-free, but my whole family likes this bread better than store-bought gluten-full bread.  It is not dense, dry, or crumbly at all, and when I have served it to people outside my family, they couldn't even tell it was gluten-free! This is by far the best gluten-free bread I have found.<br /><br />One tip - it does seem to rise much better for me when I make it in the oven as opposed to my bread maker.  A pastry chef had suggested to me that it may be because of the upright loaf pan (rather than a horizontal one) in my bread maker not allowing it to rise well, since gluten-free breads often have difficulty rising anyway.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give this bread 5 stars is because I am so disappointed that Amazon has removed it from their "Subscribe & Save" program.  It is still much cheaper here than buying it in the stores, though.

We have tried several kinds and have found this to be the closest in texture and taste to wheat based breads.  Cook it in a bread machine using the light bread setting (if cooked too long the crust can become chewy).  Also used dough cycle to make rolls so my husband could have a hamburger bun.  Used the bread also to make stuffing.  Highly recommend this.

review/summary: GF Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread
review/text: My husband and 3 of our 4 kids were recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease. It's been a struggle to feed the crew but discovering this product has been a big help. We actually did a bake off with 3 different brands and no question Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich bread was the winner. Once in a while we use their French bread mix for variety. If you're new to this gluten free thing my advice is to buy a bread machine with a delay timer, load it up before you go to bed and when you wake up you'll have a nice, fresh loaf of bread. When it's just made it's great. Later you'll need to toast it. We also make French toast and grilled cheese sandwiches from this and the kids feel like their back to being regular members of the eating world!

My sons gobbled down the first loaf in record time.  They love it.  We also used it to make mini hamburger buns for the kids, baking the bread in cup cake pans.  Definitely worth it.  And, it is not overly time consuming like so many other bread recipes.<br /><br />This bread does have a bit of a yeasty flavor and is not all light and fluffy, but is not heavy as a brick like most GF breads that we have come across.  It also makes a great grilled cheese!

Tried the rice breads but they just didn't come close to a bread product.  I add fiber and honey to the bread and it does not change the consistency at all.

review/summary: Now THIS is an excellent bread
review/text: I was really excited when I discovered this foolproof bread mix- it has great texture and flavor- and actually tastes GOOD. Try it with margarine (or butter) and honey on top- I think you won't be disappointed. Also works really well in a bread machine, even if it doesn't have a gluten free cycle. This is a great bread for newly diagnosed celiacs (just remember, it won't be QUITE like you remember gluten being, but it's a new, good different) as it is so easy and only requires a few common ingredients. Then after you have your legs under you, you can try the world of gluten free baking from scratch, which in my experience yields the absolute best results. BUT this bread is great for times when there's no time for serious baking, and is WAY better than most of those nasty premade breads (though Whole Foods sundried tomato bread may give it a run for its money). I almost feel like I should give it 4 stars, because I stopped buying it after a while, but it really is good for what it is, so in memory of my old relationship with this bread mix, I gave it a 5. :) (I  am currently in a Bette Hagman phase- search for her cookbooks)

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: I bought this bread mix due the high rated reviews.  The mix made a beautiful loaf, but the flavor wasn't the greatest.  The only way I was able to eat it, was to pile it with peanut butter and jelly.  As stated by one of the reviews it also contains milk, I'm lactose intolerant. I will give Pamela's a try.

review/summary: Who Knew Bread Could Make Me Cry.....
review/text: Who knew bread could make me cry!! With a new diagnosis and a grumpy picky 15 year old son.... I was at my wits end to find something, anything he would like.  I literally held my breath when I put this mix together in my bread maker (2lb wellbuilt - and it actually overflowed my bread pan!!) anyways... signs on the doors to be quiet for fear the bread might fall.... sniffing the air every 10 minutes thinking "Yup smells like bread... could it be??".  It had just cooled when my son walked in the door starving.... (being in high school, football, and lunch time have been rough!!) I ask him to sit down I've got something for him.... holding my breath some more - watching his first bite and him jumping up and down, "Mom is this for real? This is AWESOME!"  Let me say that again, "This is AWESOME" now when have any of us heard those words from our teenagers mouth in relation to anything.  I got huge hugs, kisses and high fives, I think he even was dancing!!! My other 4 kids in the house tried it and couldn't believe it wasn't "regular" bread!! That is saying something cause let's me honest there are some out there that you just can't  fake liking, even a little bit!!  The other kids are so happy that he is happy cause these last couple of weeks have been rough on all of us, mostly on him.  Thank You Thank You Thank YOu - you won't be sorry with this mix!!

review/summary: A very good bread, with some tips
review/text: I have been gluten free for several years, and I generally don't even attempt to eat bread anymore, even the gluten free kinds.<br /><br />When we discovered that gluten seemed to really affect my autistic son, we had to come up with something for lunches for school.<br /><br />This mix had good reviews so I decided to try it. I have a dedicated gluten free breadmaker that was a gift.<br /><br />With a little toying, I was able to program my machine correctly for the bread. The first loaf I made was underdone in the middle, so I increased the baking time by five minutes for the second one. It wasn't a total loss, because I put the underdone pieces in a buttered skillet and fried them until they were done in the middle.<br /><br />You will need to choose the lightest crust setting you have and change it so there is only one rise time for the bread. Also, while the bread is mixing (it mixes for about five minutes or so), push the mix down on the sides with a rubber spatula about halfway through mixing. This only takes a minute. Now that my machine is programmed, all I have to do is hit the button, come back in about three or four minutes to push down the sides, and then in an hour I have a loaf of bread.<br /><br />As all gluten free bread, it will fall apart a bit if you cut it while still warm. The best way to do it is to make the bread, unmold it onto a paper plate, wrap it in plastic, and put it in the refrigerator. When it is cold it is much easier to cut with the bread knife. Also do NOT cut the whole loaf ahead of time or it will dry out within a couple of days.<br /><br />The bread tastes fabulous. There is milk contained within the mix, so it's not good for gluten free casein free people. I gave a fresh slice of it to a friend who is NOT gluten free and he thought it tasted great. I'll never buy store bought loaves of gluten free bread again, though. This tastes a hundred times better!

review/summary: Best Bread ever when extra water and honey is added
review/text: This bread mix is the best ever but you have to play with it a bit. Depending on which bread machine you use, extra water may need to be added. Also play with bake time till you get it right. Both of these take a bit of time but worth the effort. Also to make the bread a little more moist add about 2 tablespoons of honey to the mix, it realy helps.

review/summary: Better bread if you use your own yeast
review/text: We'd been making this bread for a long time with results that were all right but nothing to rave about.  Then we opened a mix with a packet of yeast that felt as though it had solidified.  Rather than use it and risk losing a loaf of bread, we substituted a packet of our own active dry yeast that was fresh.  What a difference it made!  The bread was lighter, fluffier and not sunken in the middle like it always is when we use the yeast that's included in the package.  Now we are using our own yeast to make this bread, which increases the cost.  Glutino's "Perfect Rise Yeast" is not only far from perfect, it's apparently stale and/or out of date.  The Glutino company needs to do better!

review/text: I waited until I made this bread mix a few times before I would review it. This has by far been my favorite bread mix. I have completely given up on trying to make my own and will now ONLY buy this.<br /><br />A couple things to note is 1.) I let the dough rise accidently for 2.5 hours and I must say this was the best accident. The bread rose above the pan and rolled over some but it was almost like it completely changed the texture of the bread. It was way more fluffy like real bread. I will from here on out be letting this dough rise for at least 2 hours. 2.) I like to place foil on it half way through so that the crust doesn't become too dark, and 3.) when I pull it out of the oven I  like to baste it with milk and it softens the texture of the crust.

review/summary: Begin With This
review/text: This is perhaps the easiest, most neutral tasting GF bread mix I have tried yet. It was the first I bought, and it made my GF transition much simpler.<br /><br />You CAN mix this by hand. I tried a single box first to be sure, then came here and ordered a case. It makes a large, 'normal' looking loaf of bread. The texture is wonderful for the first 2-3 days, then I slice what's left and store in my freezer until I need another slice. Try the Cinnamon Raisin bread recipe and make french toast for a real treat! Play around with the recipe. Try it with milk, then water. Try it with butter, then oil. Eggs, or egg-less. My personal combo is oil, eggs, and 3/4 water to 1/4 milk.<br /><br />The cons? A bit crumbly, and not enough 'chew' to the bread to pretend you are eating a rustic bread. All and all though...you can't go wrong starting your gluten free journey here.

review/summary: The bread that fools them all!
review/text: Our 9 year old was recently diagnosed as celiac and we suspect she may not be the only one in our family with the 'wheat issue'.  My 9 year old loves to eat bread and milk and, of course, now she can't have either.  I knew there were gluten-free flours and breads out there, but they're not easy to find in my local grocery store.  I went online to Amazon Grocery to see if they offered anything and to see what customers' reviews were.  I wanted to try something that others had enjoyed, not just buy whatever (few) items they happened to carry in town. This bread mix was very highly rated, so I bought a whole case to give it a try.<br /><br />I received a bread machine from my mother that wasn't a special 'gluten-free' type bread machine, so I gave this bread mix a try using the standard method.  It took some adjusting to get the best ingredient combination to yield the right taste and texture, but this formula is a winner!  The instructions on the box call for either milk or water, butter or oil, and several types of egg combinations.  The best tasting (and texture) combination was milk, olive oil and 2 large (whole) eggs.  The smell of the freshly baked bread brings the whole family out of hiding and into the kitchen, salivating as I slice into the warm loaf.<br /><br />Celiacs need not despair!!!  This gluten-free bread mix makes the most delicious bread that's so good it's hard to believe it's not traditional wheat bread.  It also takes the hassle out of trying to purchase and concoct a wheat-flour substitute that can be used to THEN make bread that anyone accustomed to wheat bread might actually want to eat.  Our whole family LOVES this bread.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!

review/summary: Too Yummy to be GF!!
review/text: We have tried many GF breads ... both prepared and mixes.  None of them were acceptable substitutes for "real" bread.  This bread is a keeper. Rises well. Slices easily.  Tastes great.  My son loves it so much that we put it on auto order.  My husband got into it and didn't realize that it was GF.<br /><br />Hint 1:  This makes a 2 pound loaf.  It WILL rise enough to overflow a 1.5 loaf bread machine.  I use the bread machine just to mix the batter and then let it rise on the counter and cook it in the oven.<br /><br />Hint 2:  No preservatives.  The bread stores best if you let it cool, slice the entire loaf, and store in the freezer.<br /><br />Hint 3:  This bread mix is NOT casein-free.  Milk is ingredient #4.  Whey is #5.

review/summary: First time buns/hot turkey sandwiches.
review/text: I made a gluten free meal for my Bunco group.  My menu was early Thanksgiving.  The main item was hot turkey sandwiches.  I mixed the Gluten Free Pantry Sandwich Bread Mix according to manual directions.  I divided it into 12 greased  8 oz.Corelle bowls, covered them with plastic wrap sprayed with Pam.  I put them on two cookie sheets in the oven preheated to 250 with a pan of boiling water and shut the oven off  to rise until I liked how they looked.  I removed the plastic wrap and heated the oven to the temp. on the box of mix and baked until golden brown and sounded hollow when I tapped the top.  I cooled them on a rack and then froze them in zip lock bags.  The day of my party I took them out of the freezer and cut them in half.  I placed them on a serving tray and put them in a paper grocery bag to warm them in the oven just before serving.  My gluten free friends were elated to have real food that everyone was eating as well and they didn't have to worry what they could or couldn't eat.  By the way, the rest of the menu was Sweet Potato Oven Fries, Cranberry Applesauce, Relish Tray of Carrots, Celery, Ripe Olives and Pimento Olives and Pumpkin Mousse for dessert.

review/text: I have used this bread mix for quite some time now.  I recently ordered Pamela's gluten free bread mix, which came in a close second place, but I kept wishing I had the mix from the Gluten Free Pantry instead.  It bakes a loaf that is not too different from gluten containing bread.  Some GF bread mixes make a doughy loaf, but this mix bakes all the way through with a consistent texture.  Although most GF breads need to be toasted to make them more palatable, you really can make a very good sandwich with this bread untoasted. Like most GF products, you need to refrigerate this bread to prevent mold.  If you are looking for a GF bread mix I definitely recommend this mix from The Gluten Free Pantry!

review/summary: Wonderful Hearty Bread
review/text: This is a wonderful mix that makes a hearty bread and works excellently in my breadmaker on the regular setting.  I have been using it for over a year now, since I was diagnosed with Celiac disease, and I've never missed wheat bread since I began using it.<br /><br />It's very easy to make in the breadmaker.  The mix does take two eggs, which might be more than some people would like to use, and butter or oil as well as milk or water.  I usually use dry, non-fat milk and real butter.  It made primarily of corn flour and rice flour, has a full flavor, and is dense but not heavy.  My husband, who is not gluten free, enjoys it as well, especially toasted.  It has been commented to me that it has a slightly sweet taste, but I don't particularly notice that.<br /><br />I use it for cold sandwiches such as peanut butter or chicken salad, for hot sandwiches such as grilled cheese, and it makes the most excellent toast I have ever eaten.<br /><br />I have tried other gluten free breads, but this remains my favorite.

review/summary: Okay but not great
review/text: Positives:The mix is easy and quick to make, requiring only about an hour total time for a loaf of bread. Appearance is very close to a wheat-based 'white' bread. Cost is comparable to most other mixes that I've tried. It keeps well and holds together well with toasting and constructing a sandwich. It made good croutons, too.<br /><br />Negatives: I did not really care for the texture that much. It is fine at the first bite, but with chewing falls apart into a granular mouth-feel that is off-putting. Also, the bread has something of an after-taste that I did not like very much. I found myself really loading up my sandwich with spicy mustard, pickles, tomatoes, et cetera to cover up the taste.<br /><br />Overall, this bread is "okay" but not great. It is certainly better than most of the loaves you will pick-up from the freezer at the grocer's. I would recommend trying it if you are looking a child-friendly gluten-free bread, as it does look very much like white bread.<br /><br />*The texture improved when I made the bread using a bread machine vs. by hand. I would recommend that method for making this particular brand.

review/summary: Best bread ever- ridiculously easy to make.
review/text: I've tried about a thousand different packaged gluten-free bread mixes, making bread for my girlfriend.<br />I've tried gluten free flour that replaces regular flour 1-to-1.<br />They have all turned out mediocre at best, inedible at worst<br />Kobe beef burgers with absolutely inedible buns),<br />with all the loaves being small, dense, and not much rise or loft.<br />This was the happy opposite.<br />I don't have a bread machine, but I followed the simple instructions- water, butter, eggs, mix for three minutes. Seriously, three minutes, and then turn out into the pan, smooth with wet hands or spatula, cover and let rise.<br />It cooks in only 30 minutes(!!!), and is done when it sounds hollow when thumped. Every other recipe I've ever tried cooks for 45-60 minutes until it reaches an internal temp. of 190-210.<br />I let this rise on the stove top for 45 minutes as the oven pre-heated, and then put it in to bake. I about had a stroke when I checked on it, and it had risen over the top of the pan to make a regular sized and shaped loaf. Mine finished in about twenty five minutes. I unpanned it immediately and let it cool on a rack for about thirty minutes. I sliced several pieces, and they were moist and tender, and tasted like regular bread.<br />If I could give this six stars I would.<br />Two quick notes,<br />Gluten free breads are fragile- you must let them cool before you slice or handle them.<br />When you cover the bread to let it rise, I used a sheet of plastic wrap I smeared with Crisco. It really worked well to stop the risen bread from sticking to the plastic, and allowed the plastic to be removed without peeling the skin from the loaf.

review/text: One box of this in a 2 lb bread maker comes out perfect. Rises wonderfully. Texture is great- even sliced thin for sandwiches. Definitely use WHOLE MILK instead of water (it mentions it in the directions). This is the closest it comes to wheat bread- enjoy it.

review/summary: Best bread mix I have found
review/text: I have had celiac for over 10 years and I have tried many bread mixes over that time. This is the best tasting mix I have used and is the only one that I can truly make a sandwich out of. Does help if you toast the bread first, it holds together beautifully when you do.

review/summary: Best-Tasting Gluten-Free Bread Mix
review/text: This is one of the easiest bread mixes to use. You should really have a Zojirushi Bread Mixer for the best results as gluten-free mixes are heavier then regular mixes and require two beaters, which the Zojirushi mixers have. The finished product makes delicious sandwiches, both plain and toasted.

review/summary: Really Good
review/text: I've been on a gluten free diet for about 8 years now and have tried quite a few different gluten free bread mixes. While many of these products are good, the Gluten Free Pantry goes above and beyond in my opinion.  It is by far the best tasting bread I have had since being gluten free.  I do not have a bread mixer so I mix this by hand and it is actually quite simple.  I usually con my husband into helping stir for a minute or two once the batter becomes thick, but I've also done it solo with a quick break here and there.  Whenever this comes out of the oven I usually have to fight to keep my husband away from the bread.  He is not gluten free, but he really likes the taste.  I tend to keep the loaf in the refrigerator after it has cooled and it will usually last about 5-6 days.  I'm sure you could freeze it for longer preservation, but I haven't yet done this.  The bread has a really good consistency and it holds up like any normal bread for sandwich making.  I really can't say enough about this product.  I will certainly be purchasing it for as long as it is available.

review/summary: Fantastic...Every Time!
review/text: This bread has been a staple in our household for the last 3 years.  After my wife and oldest daughter were diagnosed with Celiac Disease, we went on the hunt for good bread.  It certainly took a while with some barely edible "bread" along the way.  Now I make a loaf of GF Pantry bread almost every weekend and watch it go.  I have a hard time leaving it for them.  I typically add 1tsp of Potato Flour (not starch) to keep it from getting crumbly.  I also add a couple of Tbsp of ground Flax Seed for some whole grain.  I let it rise for about an hour in a warm place or oven. For sandwiches, French Toast, grilled cheese, even hamburger buns, we have yet to find a better alternative.  You can't go wrong with this mix.

review/text: I have been making this bread for over 6 years for my son. It is a simple and straight forward item, and the variety of other products in the Gluten Free Pantry are good also. The flavor and texture of the bread is great, toasts (taoster oven is a best way) well, and make a mean grilled cheese. The subscription cost of the case from Amazon underscores the shelf price at the stores, and is worth looking in to. I make 2 boxes at a time, slice & freeze for 10-14 days of bread to use.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8H4">The Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, 22-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Amazing bread mix!
review/text: This honestly is the best GF bread mix we've ever tried (and we've been GF for 2 years and have been trying GF bread mixes the whole time).  Hubby needs one that is millet free, and I need one that is soy free, and this is free of both!  He has never had a reaction to it, and it tastes amazing!  I'm not sure if this is specific to my Breadman GF Breadmaker, but when I bake the bread, it does not always cook all the way... I just have to put it in for a "bake" only cycle in addition to the regular cycle, and it's perfect - such a minor inconvenience for such an amazing bread that our family can eat  :)  I highly recommend cutting the bread as soon as it comes out - once it has sat out for a while it tends to be a little dry, making the bread fall apart during slicing.<br /><br />I bought a few boxes at Whole Foods, but will be ordering the case since Whole Foods doesn't always stay on top of keeping it in stock.  I totally recommend it!

review/summary: Like Whole Grain Bread?
review/text: This bread mix is wonderful and I recommend it to everyone, even those not living gluten-free!  I have always been afraid to try making my own yeast bread, but this mix is so easy to make!  It's a hearty bread with the texture of sourdough and is awesome for grilled cheese sandwiches or toasted and served with a bowl of soup.  I played with this mix a bit and have created a great "whole grain" bread by adding 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons each of sesame, sunflower, flax, & chia seeds, plus 2 tbsp. whole oats.  Then I sprinkle a generous amount of sesame seeds across the top of the loaf, let it rise, then bake as recommended.  It was a bit dry the first time I made it this way, so I added 2 egg whites to the next loaf and was delighted with the results!

review/summary: High-rise and heavenly!
review/text: I have baked two loaves of bread with this mix.  Both have turned out fantastic!  The resulting bread rises to a high loaf that is "normal" sized and slices evenly.  It is delicious, too!  It has been wonderful to have sandwiches again!  I used 2% milk instead of water and added a teaspoon of sugar to the milk and yeast mixture to give the yeast something to chew on.  I used coconut oil as the vegetable oil.  I have found that the bread machine never really mixes dough well enough and so I mixed the dough using my Kitchenaid.  I beat the dough for 2-3 minutes and then transferred it to my bread machine pan (which I sprayed with vegetable spray for good measure).  This removed the need for the paddle (which always tears a hole in the bread).  I set the machine at 2 hours and let it go!  The bread rises perfectly, bakes perfectly, slices perfectly, and tastes wonderful!  Oh, instead of sugar, I added a tablespoon of molasses to the second loaf.  This gave it a nice flavor.  I'm going to try honey next, then, maybe some cheese, then, maybe some dried onion, then...  I am so glad I signed up for Subscribe and Save because I'll be making a couple of loaves of this bread a week!

I have experimented widely with adding ingredients (such as pumpkin and pie spices; cheddar and onions; italian seasonings; molasses; and cardamom and anise) to this mix and have never made a bad loaf.  Very versatile, but - like all g-f products - more expensive than the non g-f versions.

review/summary: Best bread so far
review/text: This is the only gluten free bread that I have found that taste good. The first couple of times I made it in the bread machine but never turned out. Now I just use the dough cycle then I split a loaf pan w/ reynolds wrap and put in half the dough. I add cinnamon and raisins to the other half and put that in the pan then bake it. I let it cool slice it and then wrap each slice and freeze it right away. The cinnamon raisin makes great french toast. If you don't freeze it the taste is only good out of the oven, by the next day it does not taste good and gets dry. It is also good for making rolls.

review/text: This is the best gluten-free mix I've ever bought. I play around with this mix, adding extra yeast, yogurt, and other tasties. The texture is similar to corn bread, much less gritty than other mixes I've tried. My non-gf friends enjoy eating it. It is especially tasty warm and fresh. Freeze to keep fresher. Unfortunately, it cannot compare with fresh baked wheat bread.

review/summary: Makes the BEST GF Pizza Dough!!!!
review/text: I accidentally made a little to much of this mix in my bread maker and I didn't want it to bake over and burn, so I scooped some out and put it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes.  What I discovered was the fluffiest best tasting GF pizza crust I've ever made.  It doesn't crumble and it doesn't have a weird texture.  Make the dough with the dough setting of a bread maker. I used 1 whole egg and two egg whites and I used 3 tbs. of canola oil instead of 4 tbs. of butter. Here's the important part... pour it like you would cake batter, not like you would pizza dough. Cook it on aluminum foil that is greased with canola oil at 400 degrees until it is slightly brown and you can stick a knife in without residue.  YUM YUM YUM!

review/text: This bread mix was okay.  If you haven't eaten bread in a long while and are just dying for a taste of bread, this will do it.  But you have to smother it with something - anything - in order to enjoy it.  It was pretty decent fresh out of the bread machine, but after refrigeration I ate some, spit it out and froze the rest for breadcrumbs later.  It tastes way better than store-bought GF bread, so that's a big plus. Nothing to write home about, though, IMHO.

I did a search hear at amazon and found this and I bought a 6 pack. I was really happy with how easy it is, All You need is the entire bag of Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, the included packet of yeast (2 1/4 tsp.); 1 3/4 cups lukewarm water or Milk, 4 tbsp melted butter or vegetable oil, 2 large eggs or 1 egg and 2 egg whites, lightly beaten. And follow your bead machine directions for combining and your all set (with my machine its liquids first yeast last). You can even vary the recipe make cinnamon reason brea quite easily. And you can very the yeast to make it faster if desired. I am very pleased with how the bread comes out, it taste good has a nice texture and is very substantial. This is wonderful for anyone who needs to eat Gluten free and its even man proof because even I can do it.

review/text: i have been buying this bread mix for over a year because it has good taste and texture. I have introduced my nieces to it as they have wheat allergies also. One of my nieces also has a yeast allergy, and uses this mix by substituting baking powder for the yeast.  It can be mixed in a bread maker by using the separate quick bread (to mix)and bake preset buttons, or bake in the oven. It takes a longer rising time than indicated on the box - the box says 1/2 hour, but an hour is better - when using the yeast.<br />If using baking powder, no rising time is necessary. Just mix and bake.

It reminds me of the bread my Mom used to make, fresh out of the oven with all the good smells. I put butter and honey on the first slice and went right back to my childhood. Thank you Gluten Free Pantry!I have to say I have a plain Jane, single paddle breadmaker, nothing fancy so I was skeptical that my breadmaker would produce the best bread. I used the "Rapid" option and it came out just fine. The color and texture were perfect, it did not fall apart or have a strange flavor (as other bread reviews I read) and it could be sliced immediately (serrated knives work best). I will definitely buy more of this bread mix. I would like to recommend that they package this product for 1 1/2 lb loafs as well (my breadmaker only goes to 1 1/2 lbs) or in bulk bags for more economy.

review/text: Just recently went gluten free as much as possible in the home.  My first loaf was alright but tasted good when I toasted slices, I forgot to lightly beat the eggs so it was more dense and I drizzled honey right before it was done baking.  The second batch is awesome!  Fluffier than the first and this time I mixed the honey in and used soy milk instead of water - tastes really good!  My husband likes it.  The bread also tastes good with Philadelphia's spinach and artichoke cream cheese, YUM!  I cook this on my Breville Bread maker I bought on Sonoma's site.  I'm a Cuisinart fan but I like Breville's bread maker better, more stylish and love the LCD display.  Too bad Amazon doesn't sell it on their site, it's exclusive to Sonoma.

review/summary: The best gluten free bread
review/text: From Michael's other half - I have made a lot of gluten free breads. Gluten-free bread baking is an art, not a science. Weather, moods, oven differences, and mischievous fairies can all wreak havoc, even with the best recipe. That being said, I figured that I would need a few tries to get this mix to an edible form. But I did NOT!! First try, using my breadman bread maker for a 2.0lb White loaf with medium crust did the trick perfectly. I used milk instead of water as optioned on the recipe and 2 whole eggs (also an option). This turned out tasting great, spongy texture, and after the third day in the fridge it is still moist. Not to mention the most fabulous smell in my kitchen. I can't wait to start experimenting with different flavors. I am going to make an herb loaf and a cinnamon roll flavored loaf to see how they turn out. In the meantime, I have great sandwich and french toast bread.

review/summary: I'm CocoNUTS for this bread!
review/text: I used this mix all the time and substitute 1/2 to 3/4 of the water for coconut milk.  Makes the bread a bit thicker (denser) but really tastes good.  I also slice it as soon as it is cooled and freeze it in individual slices so I can take it when I travel (via car to my daughter's home 7 hours away).

review/summary: So much better than frozen breads
review/text: I've tried some frozen gluten free breads for my 9yo, and she has not liked any of them, even toasted.  This bread she liked and ate - and to me, it tastes like a typical potato bread.  I will be buying more!

review/summary: yummy!
review/text: THIS IS THE BEST BREAD WE HAVE TRIED FOR OUR 11 YEAR OLD WITH CELIAC DISEASE.  THE TEXTURE IS AS GOOD AS WHITE BREAD AND THE FLAVOR IS DELICIOUS. WE HAVE ADDED HERBS, CINNAMON, AND OTHER SPICES TO CHANGE IT UP. THE DOUGH CAN BE STICKY, SO WE MOISTEN OUR HANDS WITH WATER WHEN PATTING THE TOP TO LEVEL THE DOUGH.  THIS HELPS THE BREAD TO BE SMOOTHER ON TOP.  THIS BREAD IS BEST BAKED IN LOAF PANS IN THE OVEN RATHER THAN A BREAD MACHINE.  THE AROMA IS DELICIOUS WHEN BAKING.  WE ALSO USE CANOLA OIL INSTEAD OF BUTTER IN THE MIX.  YOU WILL NEED TO KEEP IT WRAPPED AND IN THE FRIDGE UNLESS YOU ARE A FAST BREAD EATER.  YOU CAN ALSO SLICE THE LOAF, THEN WRAP IT AND FREEZE IT AFTER IT HAS COOLED.  I ALSO ENJOY MY DAUGHTERS BREAD. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8H4">The Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, 22-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Delicious and Soft
review/text: I was skeptical about this gluten free bread actually tasting good (after some bad experiences with other poor excuses for gf bread). This was not only easy to bake, it came out soft and delicious. I am enjoying it toasted, with peanut butter, right now. I'm keeping mine in the refrigerator wrapped in saran wrap, and only cutting the slices I need to keep it fresh.

review/summary: Recipe Alteration Needed
review/text: This is the house favorite for my Celiac Teen. One minor alteration: reduce yeast by � teaspoon to keep bread from rising over top of bread maker and burning on coils, at least if you live in a zone similar to the Central Coast of California.  Also, order by the case with monthly shipping, it's much cheaper. Local stores charge as much as $9.99 per box and Amazon makes sure you get boxes with the best expiration dates. We go through at least a box per week.

review/summary: Almost like my wifes homemade bread.
review/text: I was diagnosed with Celiac Sprue and a gluten intolerance in 2002. I have never found a gluten free bread mix as good as this one is. When I bake this bread it smells just like my wife's homemade bread. I can eat sandwiches, toast, grilled cheese sandwiches, etc again. Great product. Thank you.

review/summary: gluten-free bread
review/text: One of the best products on the market today for gluten-free individuals. Makes a bread product that can pass for the real thing and you don't feel deprived at all. perfect loaf 95% of the time without intervention in a bread machine. Have also used it for the basics for a specialty bread and it works well. Works well for "homemade" hamburger buns and rolls.

review/summary: Very good bread mix
review/text: In response to other reviews I added a couple of tablespoons of agave nectar to the mix to give the yeast some extra sugar to use. The bread turned out wonderful and I like it. Maybe not exactly the same as wheat bread but much better than most I have tried.<br /><br />For someone who still has yeast not getting the bread to rise, it may be your water. Try a batch with bottled water & see if this makes a difference.

review/text: Hands down the best Gluten Free bread I've experienced since I've been gluten-free.  It's fluffy, can be eaten without toasting.  I finally can enjoy a sandwich again, even cold!
