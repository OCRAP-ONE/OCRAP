review/text: because of the shape of the crystals makes it is difficult to get a even spread. Some parts of your steak are saltier than others. It does have a nice crunch but the taste is not so special, to my buds anyway. I prefer French Grey Salt for taste and since it is a fine grain it can be 'applied' evenly. Not to mention the price 17 bucks for 5 lbs delivered.

review/text: I usually purchase the rolled rawhide bones but I decided to try these. They seemed to last a little longer than the rolled rawhide, but don't give them to your pooch if you have carpet. They make a huge mess and the pieces stick in the carpet, plus I worried that a large piece might break off and cause my dogs to choke or have a blockage.

review/summary: Anna Perciatelli #15 and DaVinci Bucatoni Pasta
review/text: The two pastas being rated are hollow spaghetti type pastas, one larger than the other. What happened, after many years, a E-mail friend of of mine said she loved this type of pasta but could not find it any more in the market.  Which set off a Bulb in me and I decided to find these pastas somewhere. Any how , Lo and behold I found them in Amazons inventory.  So any way, I ordered 20 lbs of each, which were delivered to me in the Shanandoah (sic) Valley in two days, thats 40 lbs of pasta for the UPS man to carry up on the porch.  Of course I could not eat 40 lbs of pasta, so I gave much of it away as a surprise.  Which it was to most people who are not familiar with this type of pasta  but enjoy the taste of the pasta in their Spags dinner.  What can I say as I ordered another 20 X 20 pounds of each which I am using now.

review/summary: Worst garbage ever
review/text: Is there any actual yeast in this?  I have used this many times from several different batches.  Each time I was careful to make sure that it was nowhere near the expiration date.  In EVERY case, the bread has failed to rise.  This is worse than garbage as it ruins all the ingredients and you have to throw it all out; there is little worse than needlessly wasting food.  There appears to be little or no actual yeast in this so-called "yeast".<br /><br />Update May 2012:<br /><br />I have been experimenting with this brand of yeast by trying to activate in the following manner.  Take one packet (about two teaspoons), add 1/4 teaspoon of sugar and 1/4 cup of water between 110 and 120 degrees.  Put it in a coffee cup and get it all nice and wet and wait about five minutes.  Red Star brand and Fleischmans (regular and fast rising) and the Hodgson Mill yeast in their bread machine mixes (the only other ones I have checked) yeast will rise and fill half the coffee mug.  (Fast risers fill the whole cup)  This brands increases its volume by just a little.<br /><br />I have also found that Red Star (regular, did not try the fast rise) yeast that is more than one year past its expiration date performs nearly as well as the fresh stuff.  Therefore I can say with the confidence of empirical evidence that Red Star yeast that is more than one year past the expiration on the package performs better (read: acceptable) than the packets of unexpired SAF yeast I have tried (read: unacceptable).

review/text: If you love the earthy full flavor of fresh Porcini mushrooms but can't find them (they have a limited Fall season) or just can't afford them fresh or dry (dry can run you $15/oz), this a product worth considering. You can add it to sauces, eggs, & casseroles directly or, as I do mostly, add it to your somewhat flavorless American white mushroom and get a fantastic "Porcini effect".  It is essentially a year++ supply of great mushroom flavor for $30 ( cost is dependent on what the on-going sale price is).  You can even buy it and share it with friends (sell or give) and lower the cost - 16oz goes a long way.

review/summary: A new favorite!
review/text: I had this tea for the first time at Monument Valley in the Navajo Nation.  The night I had it at The View restaurant, I enjoyed it along with a sampler platter of traditional Navajo foods.  It was so delicious and I had such a feeling of relaxation that evening, as if I had a glass of wine with dinner.  (but I had nothing alcoholic that night). I wondered if I was feeling good just because I was enjoying the meal and the culture and scenery of the area....and I was on vacation!  I bought a box to bring home with me, so I was very curious to see if I would experience that same feeling when I next consumed it.  I tried it again after a rather stressful day and I found the same thing to be true again.  I love this tea and will definitely be ordering some more when I run out!

review/text: I purchased a box of this tea when we were driving through Navajo country last year, not really knowing what to expect.  What a pleasant surprise!  The flavor is quite mild, coming as it does from a tisane of greenthread herb.  I think of it as a very slightly smoky flavored chamomile type taste.  If your stomach is upset or you're feeling anxious and unsettled, you will notice an almost immediate difference if you drink a cup of this.  I stretched out my box as long as I could because I was saving it for when I didn't feel well, so it was a real delight to find that it is now available through Amazon.  I don't know if there are any real health claims made for this tea, but it wouldn't surprise me to find that it is discovered to have potent medicinal properties.

review/summary: Great product, but the price...
review/text: This product is a must, if you are a purist, and if you are going to make Italian Beef like the meat you get in Chicago.  The juice the meat sits in is heavy with garlic flavor.  I saw a guy make it.  A huge pan of beef broth, meat juices and spices.  The garlic juice he then added was in a 1/2 gallon jug and he used it all.  One would think that would be a lot, but, frankly, you can drink that meat juice by itself, like a soup; it is that good.  But that amount is for a restaurant and their many customers.  For home use, these bottles are probably the right size; though the last time I made Italian Beef, I used 2 bottles.  It is a great taste, but the price is almost stratospheric when you consider what it is.  See if you have a friend to share a case.  [...]

Be sure to shake it vigorously to get the full benefits....oodles of 'stuff' float'n around in there!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/13/2011: I just received my 2nd bottle of this really nice oil and I have upgraded it to 5 stars because this one has a nice pleasant "olive taste" to it. Also, I like how the glass bottle is made to minimize light getting to the oil.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/22/2012: I just read the other reviewer's comments about the "unfiltered" being suspect. Actually, I had reordered another bottle of "unfiltered" recently, and guess what!!, they actually sent me a bottle that was not marked "unfiltered". So, I can see how the reviewer received a bottle that is filtered. I contacted Amazon and they gave me a full refund and I was allowed to keep the one they sent me. I will not order olive oil from Amazon again.

I have reservations if this is even unfiltered olive oil and just a false description by the seller.<br /><br />I've posted a couple pics but I can't see a single spec of anything in it (yes, I shook the heck out of it).  Nor does Delallo's website make any suggestion that this bottle of olive oil is unfiltered.

review/summary: Low calorie/low fat because it's unbearable to eat
review/text: Better'n Peanut Butter is one of the foulest things I have ever eaten. It has a runny, sticky consistency that tries to replicate the real thing, but more effectively replicates a dirty diaper. If you ignore its slightly (oddly) medicinal smell and actually consume this product, you'll wish you hadn't. The taste? Think less peanut butter, more roasted peanut-flavored glue. Low calorie/low fat? Absolutely; especially since I couldn't stand to choke down more than a few bites. In the end, I opted to go without lunch rather than eat my Better'n Peanut Butter sandwich.<br /><br />As a vegetarian who commonly shops at natural food stores/in natural food sections and who is always looking for low calorie foods, I can generally handle "alternative" flavors. I drink rice milk. I eat imitation chicken (soy based). I use whole wheat items whenever possible. So while I was not at all expecting Better'n Peanut Butter to fully live up to it's name, I at least thought it may come close to matching the taste of the real thing (I've eaten the low fat versions of Jif and Skippy peanut butter for years and actually prefer them over their full-fat predecessors). I couldn't have been more wrong.

review/summary: Better'n Peanut Butter - my opinion
review/text: Better'n Peanut Butter is way too sweet. Not good for diabetics or hypoglycemics. I am hypoglycemic. Not good for people on Nardil meds because of soy flour ingredient which is a high tyramine and I am on Nardil. I had a bad reaction just tasting a tip of teaspoon. It has a nice taste if you like real sweet, but it's a mouth full of sugar. I bought it for low fat but I'll stick with my Smart Balance Omega peanutbutter. If you took out all that sweetness and soy flour I would definitely be your permanent customer. Very rare to find low fat peanutbutter which we all need, but there is always a setback somewhere. I also took a chance buying it being it didn't show any ingredient label.

review/text: When eaten plain, this stuff is absolutely awful, inedible even.  I nearly threw it away. It almost has a bit of a coffee flavor, but in a very bad way, and the aftertaste is even worse.  However, if you eat this on a sandwich with jam, it isn't too bad.  You can tell it isn't real peanut butter, and it doesn't taste good, but it's at least tolerable.  I've been mixing it with reduced fat peanut butter- it's cheaper that way, plus it tastes MUCH better, and I'm still saving on fat and calories.  Overall, I would only recommend this if you have money to spare and you find yourself unable to eat regular peanut butter as moderately as you would like.

review/summary: Literally made me gag
review/text: I rarely write reviews, but this product is so revolting that I had to warn my fellow consumers against it. Let me preface this by saying that I am a very adventurous and multicultural eater, was a vegetarian for a while, and enjoy many vegan, soy, and natural foods. There are very few foods and textures that I do not like. I usually respect the fact that everyone has different tastes, but I am sorry to say that I cannot imagine how anyone would enjoy this product. Hoping for a lower-calorie alternative to peanut butter, I spent $6 for a small jar of this product at Target. I drove home, tasted it, and immediately gagged. Although the smell is actually not bad, the flavor and texture are disgusting. It is sticky, mealy, and tastes somewhat like a sweet peanut-flavored syrup. Despite my gag reflex, I wanted to give it a fair shot, so I tasted it a few times, including pairing it with an apple. I tried to ignore the cloying sweetness and gag-inducing texture, and once the stuff got to the back of my tongue, I was able to taste a little bit of peanut flavor. However, it was not enough to allow me to choke this product down. I was so grossed out by this product that I immediately got back in the car and drove back to the store for a refund. If you want to be adventurous and try this stuff yourself, be my guest, but don't say the other reviewers and I didn't warn you!

Just as sweet, but more peanut-y and without the gross oily stuff that's in the top of the jar on natural peanut butter. It makes great sauces and is only 2 WW points for 2 Tbs

review/text: Like others I was desperate to find a lower calorie alternative to peanut butter and made a special trip to a store to purchase this jar.  I wish I had come here first and read the reviews!!<br /><br />Horrible!  Utterly nasty.  It tasted way too sweet and nothing like peanut, the texture didn't make it either and it left the most disgusting aftertaste in my mouth.  This jar is going in the garbage sadly.. an appalling waste of money and food.  Mine was Wonder, the jar should say, 'Wonder you don't spit it out if you eat it' butter.<br /><br />I can't possibly give this even a single star but it is making me so reluctantly one because there wasn't a minus!!  And my advice?  Give it a miss.

review/summary: An Adult's Perspective
review/text: Better 'n Peanut Butter states clearly on the label that it has 85% less fat and 40% fewer calories.  It's pretty easy to deduce that they mean "better" for you as opposed to "better" tasting.  I am nearly through my first jar and I am quite impressed.  PB is my dieting nemesis and this product allows me to approximate PB without destroying my diet.  I imagine that all the critics of this product actually prefer the name brand PB of their childhood that contains peanuts, sugar, molasses, salt and FULLY HYDROGENATED oils.  Incidentally, my favorite adult PB is Smuckers Natural which has 2 ingredients (peanuts and salt), but this Better 'n Peanut Butter will fill the dieting PB void.

review/summary: Great Taste and Low Fat
review/text: Please ignore the negative reviews. They are way overdone to the point of hyperbole.<br /><br />If you can eat real, unadulterated peanut butter, then do it. But if you are like me and must be on a low-fat diet due to health reasons, then Better 'n' Peanut Butter is certainly worth a try. It has a unique taste but it still carries most of the flavor of real peanut butter with a significant reduction in calories and fat. Try it; you just might like it.

review/summary: I'm on my second case...doesn't that say it all?
review/text: What is there not to love? For people like myself that like to eat peanut butter out of the jar, it is a wonderful alternative. Two tablespoons of regular peanut butter have 190 calories and 16 grams of fat! The reduced fat peanut butter still has 180 calories and 12 grams of fat! This product has 100 calories and just 2 grams of fat for the same size serving. Sometimes when we are going for the lower calorie alternative, it can contain alot of chemicals, etc.,and may not be good for you. But this product is healthier than the original! As far as the taste is concerned, Better N Peanut Butter is better if it is mixed with something, such as in a smoothie, or on a PB&J sandwich. But to be quite honest, I now prefer it to regular peanut butter even plain. Maybe because I know that it is better for me. Anyway, for the people that have not tried it, you should definitely give it a chance.

review/summary: Not Just Another "Reduced Fat" Peanut Butter
review/text: I was tired of all of the regular brands of peanut butter offering so called "reduced" fat peanut butters when they are hardly reduced at all.  Being on a restrictive diet, I had to find something that actually worked for me.  Better'n Peanut Butter is the only TRUE diet Peanut Butter. And when it comes to taste, you hardly sacrifice at all.  I love Better'n Peanut Butter and its going to remain a vital part of my diet from here on out.

review/summary: Try it for yourself
review/text: I couldn't disagree more with the negative reviews this has been given. I thought it was very good! It does have a bit of a different taste, slightly like molasses, I thought; but the peanut flavor is there. I didn't find it to be runny at all. Maybe the earlier reviewer hadn't refrigerated it. (It must be refrigerated after opening as there are no added preservatives.) I have stayed away from PB for years because of the fat content and calories- now I can have it again! (And, no, I don't work for the company, either!) I find it to be very satisfying even without the extra calories and fat. So I would urge others to judge for themselves. If you need to limit your calorie and fat intake you just might want to give this a shot. I'm sure glad I did!

review/summary: avoided just on cost basis
review/text: Was curious about Bell Plantation "PB2" (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P4POZ8">Bell Plantation PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter, 16-Ounce</a>), which is basically what's left after pressing the oil out of peanuts. Seems expensive for repurposed animal feed, so I thought I'd look into less costly alternatives.<br /><br />A 16oz jar of Better'n at Target (and Target is the only local retailer) costs about as much as a 40oz jar of the regional grocery chain's house brand of full-fat PB. I didn't even buy it - because hey, if I'm feeling fat I'll just save a few bucks and use less regular peanut butter. I didn't even think to look at ingredients, glad I didn't end up with an inedible jar of emulsified soy/peanut flour.

review/summary: not worth the money
review/text: This peanut butter isn't cheap and it's awful! I normally eat natural peanut butter (just peanuts and some salt) or specialty peanut butter from Peanut Butter & Co. I'm health conscious and decided to give Better'n PB a try since it's less calories and fat. OMG-- the consistency is gluey and the taste is awful. I had to spit it out. It tastes nothing like peanut butter. It tastes rancid and medicinal. Don't buy this! The fat and calories from pure peanut butter are much more worth it and are healthier for you than a nasty PB with a long list of ingredients.

review/text: I'm not sure why it is receiving bad marks, because I love this peanut butter. And I do NOT work for the company. My Trader Joe's no longer carries it, so I'm buying it online. It reminds me of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. If you're expecting it to taste like Skippy, you will be disappointed. It's just different. But, it is very good. Peanuty. And I don't feel like I can tell it's low fat at all. My husband is not a big fan of it, but I had my mother try it and she loves it too. We are both life long peanut butter fanatics. So, I hope this helps.

review/text: Saw this in Trader Joe's, I was looking for a something that didn't need to be refrigerated. Nowhere on the label did it say to do so, so I thought I would take a chance on it. (I hate natural PB that sits in the fridge and gets the consistency of a tub of 5 year old spackle left in the garage.) Took a small teaspoon of it, tasted half of that- then spit it up into the sink and tossed the rest in the trash. What a waste of $3. It was the weirdest flavor; someone here likened it to peanut butter flavored glue. I can't think of much better than that.

review/summary: WEIGHT GAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: LOOKING TO GAIN WEIGHT? I wasn't. My favorite smoothie to order is the PB and Strawberry, but they use this product. After 2 smoothies 2x week for two weeks, that's what 4 cups total. My weight has gone up! I'm a size 4, 5'6, 119 lbs. I'm a fitness, health freak, so when my weight goes up, something is wrong! What is it, then? SOY. Anytime I have eaten soy, my tush, thighs, and hips grow rapidly. Soy is a phytoestrogen, a plant estrogen. Women, like me, will put on pounds (around the ovaries: hips, thighs, tush) when consumed. Clifbars are a no no for me, too. This 'magic' low-cal low-fat 'peanut butter' is half soy! I am taking my organic PB to the smoothie shop, so I can have the real deal. The fat in the peanut is good unsaturated fats, why would you want less? Also, a tip. If you would like to feel great, and lose weight fast, try eating according to blood type! I went from 132 to 119 in two weeks! Google it!<br /><br />Ciao!

review/summary: Mood Enhancing Lemonade!
review/text: The Lemon Lotus is a wonderful product. Absolutely delicious, it's like drinking a glass of sweet lemonade with an ever so slight hint of the x50 Blue Lotus extract flavor (which I also love).<br /><br />I like how they switched from the shots to the powder. It dissolves easily when steeped and stirred into hot water (or when funneled into a water bottle and shook). I prefer this for 2 reasons.<br />One, the shots where just that, shots. As a powder I can enjoy a whole glass of it!<br />Two, I can more easily control the dose -- stronger when I'm in a bad mood, or weaker if I just want a nice refreshing drink.<br /><br />As for its effects, I would say overall, it subtly puts me into a calmer, more talkative and generally happier mood.<br /><br />Overall, I really love this product and will definitely buy more as needed. Was shipped and arrived very quickly and Mood & Mind have always been more than happy to answer any questions I have about their products.<br />Highly recommended, 5/5!!!

review/summary: Lemon Lotusade? Lemonotusade? Whatever you call it, it's great!
review/text: In the time since I first discovered blue lotus, I've tried several conventional and a few unconventional methods to to consume it. The first time I got the powder, I just sort of grabbed a handful and dumped it into my mouth. That did not go well.<br /><br />Next I tried dumping a few tablespoons into yogurt and then eating it. That also did not go well.<br /><br />I tried buying the plant itself and burning it, steeping it in hot water, and even tossing it into a salad, but overall, my favorite method was making a tea out of the powder.<br /><br />Or so I thought. I decided to try the mood drink despite my apprehensions, and boy am I glad I did! When I got it, I opted to have two servings at once, since I'm what you might call a tall drink of water (or lemon lotus drink, as the case may be), and after making the drink and seeing how easily it dissolved , I resisted my urge to pinch my nose and down it in one.<br /><br />It tasted GOOD! And I don't mean the sort of "good" where you grimace and rasp "H-hey, this is *cough* kind of good!", I mean good like a nice glass of lemonade, with a hint of blue lotus. There was no annoying grit (the biggest problem I have when I make tea, but that's my fault) and it had a nice effect that wasn't too overbearing. Yet another highly enjoyable experience from a company that actually cares about the quality of their merchandise.<br /><br />BONUS RECIPE: Lemon Lotus Piledriver<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />1-4 servings of Lemon Lotus Mood Drink<br />1 bottle of Perrier or something similar<br />1-4 tablespoons of lemon juice<br />Vodka (Citrus works well, but plain is fine too)<br />2 pinches of lemon salt<br />Ice<br /><br />Directions:<br />Mix lemon lotus powder with room temp vodka, mix until drink powder is thoroughly dissolved.<br />Add in Perrier and lemon juice, put into shaker with ice and shake vigorously.<br />Pour into highball glass, garnish with lemon wedges or lotus ice cubes and serve.<br /><br />PS: Check out my blog for more recipes and such!

review/text: 50:1 lemon lotus 4 pack shots (first time user) Item was mind altering but not as powerfull as expected, started with one shot early in the day and recieved mild effects felt sort of like an alcohol buzz, later in the day i had another shot and had the same effects as b4 drank a can of beer and another shot trying to get more out of the lotus within the hour i did not feel much of a change,had a 3rd shot and no change 45 minutes later i was sober. problem could be because i didnt use right, was left wondering if maby you can only get so much effect out of product similar to kratom (you can only get so high with kratom after that you get sick and misureable) then thought maby i was suposed to take all 4 shots at once for the great feeling and phychoactive or hipnotic effect who knows it was fun anyway. After i do more research on using lotus i will most likely buy this product again and give it another run.<br />  Please do not let my story discourage you from buying and trying this product. my intent was to get the message across if you dont know how to use this product learn about it first then try it out, that way the seller doesnt get blamed for your poor results

review/summary: Does Nothing!!!
review/text: This product is a complete waste of time and money.  Me and a friend tried it with a bottle of wine and it had absolutely no noticeable effects whatsoever on either one of us.  We did feel a little more sleepy than normal after taking it.  But other than that, this product did absolutely nothing to either one of us.  After my experience with this product, I am convinced the other reviews are either shill reviews or from inexperienced users who merely received a placebo effect from this product.

review/summary: Unfit for scooping
review/text: Tostitos scoops is a misnomer, these chips are unfit for scooping anything more than whipped cream. Out of ten attempts to scoop my 7 layer bean dip with these chips, only two were successful. And out of those two success stories one of them ended poorly when the Tostitos Scoop broke in half and lodged itself in my palate. I am sticking with the Frito Lay scoops, while traditionally used for chili I think they would do a better job than these sorry pieces.

review/summary: Disappointed with the Packaging
review/text: These are delicious and hot, but they were very poorly packaged. About 70% of the rings are broken into small pieces. I paid for Funyun RINGS, not Funyun particles.<br /><br />If a vendor has so little respect for his customers as to not correct the problem even after other reviewers have also given negative reviews for the same reason, they are hopeless in my opinion.<br /><br />I should have heeded the warning, but unfortunately, these are hard to find. I rolled the dice hoping they'd addressed the problem, and I lost.<br /><br />I will not purchase from this vendor again.

review/text: I remember purchasing this fruit paste back in the 70's and thought it was a wonderful product. I'd missed seeing it over the years and was<br />pleasantly surprised to find this on Amazon. It tastes nothing like what I remember. There was absolutely no fruit flavor to this at all. It mostly tasted like olive oil leather to me. I would advise anyone looking for an apricot leather to keep searching.<br />I contacted the seller about the item's quality and they were accommodating, refunding the shipping fee.

review/summary: Great value, and YUMMY!
review/text: Although the selfish part of me wants to save all of these for myself, in fairness this wonderful product deserves a few more reviews.<br /><br />I know that these are often used for cooking, but I purchased this product in lieu of the overpriced and overly-artificial strawberry fruit leathers in little foil wrappers. These "Dried Apricot Fruit Paste" packages that I bought contain just apricot, sugar, olive oil, and glucose--a very short list, and contain almost a POUND of fruit per package. That's almost three POUNDS of fruit, rather than foil, fluff, and a few ounces of product.<br /><br />Both my daughter and I love the apricot, and we can enjoy it at any time of the year. I just unwrap some, cut it into pieces with a pair of scissors, and arrange them in a little bowl to enjoy. My daughter always wants seconds, but they're a treat, and sticky, so I limit them the same way as one would with candy.<br /><br />If you enjoy fruit leather for treats, these are AWESOME. Please try them, but also please don't drive up the market price on me too much because I still want to enjoy them.

review/summary: A tasty cereal for breakfast or snack
review/text: My kids love this cereal. It tastes like cookies without nearly the richness of real cookies and not as sweet. The "chocolate chips" are merely specks and I don't taste that at all. Sure, it has sugar, but it is also fortified with lots of vitamins and minerals and I'm okay with that. The cereal is good with milk or dry. It's not as messy as some other cereals when eaten dry, so it makes a great on-the-go snack.

review/summary: The taste of Asia
review/text: I could not figure out why my Asian food did not taste the same.<br />I would walk into an Asian restaurant and see signs indicating "We do not use MSG".<br />I did not even know what MSG was.<br />Well, I did a little research and found out that MSG was the essence of Asian flavor.<br />All the Doom and Gloom types have given it a bad rap. It's just like anything else, consumed to extremes... Bad,  consumed once in a while... Very Good!<br />Sure, some people might be sensitive to this particular spice and they should not use it.  As for the rest of us.... MSG gives food a unique taste that can not be duplicated. Soooo, Keep your paws off of my MSG so I can experience Asian food as it was meant to be.

review/text: Well, as a Chinese people who moved to the US for a master's degree, I was kinda shocked that how you guys feared MSG so much. I've been taking MSG (so is most of Chinese people) for over 20 years and I'm still alive and kicking. MSG could be harmful if you heat it up too much, however, as long as you guys use it after remove the dish from the heat of just use it in your salad, it's perfectly fine.

review/summary: Medicinal Considerations
review/text: MSG has purpose beyond seasoning.  It is a meat tenderizer, and that is the aspect I'd like to address here.  The way it works as a meat tenderizer is by denaturing protein; once denatured the protein can not function as originally intended.<br /><br />Some 20 years ago our then 12 year old daughter was in the Gulf of Mexico and waded through a school of baby jellyfish.  For those not familiar, baby jellyfish can be as small as an ant, but they sting like a bee.  She got them in her swim suit and was really in distress by the time she got to us.<br /><br />I sent Mom to the grocery store for some MSG and instructed her to take our daughter to the rest room and coat her stings with MSG.  In 15 minutes she was OK, and had no lasting effects.<br /><br />I have no medical training and profess no medical knowledge; I did take chemistry in college and understand denaturing proteins, and I also know that most venom by snakes, bugs, spiders, you pick it, is a protein.  Egg proteins injected IV will kill as fast as a rattle snake; foreign protein is a poison.<br /><br />I am not advising anyone to follow my recommendation, I am not giving medical advise here, I'm simply saying our family has been using MSG for superficial bites of any kind for the last 20 years with substantial success.  Normally a small amount made into a paste or liquid spread on the bite serves the purpose.

review/summary: What a blessing!
review/text: I just love this broth and was dumbstruck when my local stores stopped carrying it.I actually thought College Inn discontinued it.<br />While on a weekend away, I found 8 boxes for a buck a piece at a Big Lots. I felt like I had struck gold, bought all of them, but was then SURE they had been discontinued.<br />Today, I decided to go to College Inn dot com and saw that they still made it. I called customer service and the gentleman there told me to go to Amazon.com AND to tell my local grocery managers that I want that product back.<br />I am sooo thrilled to see it will soon be available here and cant wait to get the notification!<br />My recipes are knocked out of the ballpark with this broth...it adds a depth of flavor that you just cant get with plain chicken broth, even if you add what you think will replicate the complexity of the broth.<br />Last week I made Thai peanut noodles...using the Culinary Broth to smooth out the peanut butter, added a bit EACH of lemongrass, garlic and ginger pastes, soy sauce and sesame oil. Toss with cooked linguine and lots of thinly sliced scallions. Voila! It was so darn good, I could slap yo' mama!!<br />Thank you, Amazon!! I will be waiting...but please hurry!

review/text: How relieved I was to find an outlet for the College Inn Culinary Broth's. I have searced all of our local area's, and was dissappointed, to think the Thai Coconut Curry  product was no longer available. This is a great product! Last summer, I cut-out the Thai Vegetable Noodle Soup recipe on the Thai Coconut Curry Broth carton. This soup was a big hit at a family reunion. It was a bit spicy for me, but, I modified it by reducing the red pepper, curry, & ginger amounts slightly,for my taste. I was also out of any thin spaghetti item's at the time, so I used some ramin style noodles I had on hand. Great recipe! (You may need to contact College Inn's Consumer Affairs Dept. to get it). I am inspired by the reviews & ideas other's are sharing, can't wait to try some of those as well....V.T. - No. CA.

review/summary: Great snacks
review/text: These are loved by my 2 and 4 year old and they take it with them to their daycare at least twice a week.  It is very difficult to find these in Puerto Rico so it is great that they can be bought from Amazon and shipped to PR!!

review/summary: Not fresh
review/text: I was very disappointed with this tea, it didn't taste fresh.  It was not delivered in an air tight container and the leaves have very low fragrance and the brewed tea has a poor weak taste.  I felt the decaf teas from Taylor's of Harrogate and Clipper were significantly better.

review/summary: "Begula" caviar
review/text: Tried the squid ink with pearl couscous to make a recipe called "Begula" caviar.  It was extremely tasty!  It's also great mixed in with any pasta to serve with fish or seafood entrees.

review/summary: Works great
review/text: Be warned that the little packets will say the date on them is from i believe 2010, but they last for up to 4 years after the date. I had used it to make a black fettucini and spaghetti  it came out really good.

review/summary: Not bad but expired product...
review/text: maybe squid (cuttlefish actually) ink doesn't expire exactly on it's expiration date, but any well respected company shouldn't send you a product that is 5 months past it's due. i'd also appreciate it if they called it cuttlefish ink since that's what it is.

review/summary: Don't order from this company
review/text: I ordered this product and when it arrived it was expired - by 4 months. Unfortunatly I did not notice this until  I went to use it a couple of weeks later. What company send expired products? This is enough for me to never order from them ever again!

review/summary: Excellent recovery drink for hardcore workouts
review/text: I've been using the Pacific Lab products for the past two years and have really noticed an improvement in my overall recovery levels.<br /><br />Definitely worth a try.<br /><br />Try the lemonade flavor, the fruit punch is not so great.

review/summary: not as tasty as fruit punch, but still delivers!
review/text: I use the product almost daily (swim, bike, run)- I like the fruit punch flavor better than the lemonade oddly, because I LOVE lemonade.  The primary reason I use this product is for the "lite" version that is is.  The decreased sugar content compared to regular-strength Accelerade is key - but still provides a small amount of protein.  I have not had any GI issues with this product which is also key for me.  I wish the Hydro version was fortified with Vitamin C like the regular strength is....otherwise, it does the job.

review/summary: No scoop!
review/text: This is the second Pacific Health brand I have used, the first being the orange flavored Accelerade.  I tried this one because it has less sugar.  It also has less protein, which I didnt know until I got it, my bad for not checking ahead of time.  The product taste fine, but it did not come with a scoop, which I found odd, especially since the directions state that one serving size is one scoop.  Maybe I just got the one can that didnt have a scoop.  Overall a good product.

review/summary: From my Blog
review/text: [...]<br /><br />I picked up 2 packages of Accelerade Hydro today.  Accelerade is the direct competitor to my favorite drink powder; Endurox R4.  Both Endurox and Accelerade use the 4:1 ratio of carbs to protein.  There is a version of Endurox R4 called "Restore" which has fewer calories and less sugar than the original but I have yet to find it when I need it so instead I will be reviewing the competitors product:<br /><br />Accelerade HYDRO<br />Usage Instructions: Mix 1 packet with 12oz of water. Use before, during, and after exercise.<br />Copy: All the rehydration and endurance benefits of a regular sports drink with: 30% fewer calories; 55% less sugar<br />The secret of Accelerade Hydro is the patented and proven 4-1 carbohydrate-protein ration. Studies show that Accelerade Hydro:<br />Enhances Rehydration - Rehydrates athletes as effectively as a regular sports drink and twice as effectively as water.<br />Extends Endurance - Extends endurance as much as a regular sports drink and 48% more than water.<br /><br />Calories: 60<br />Calories from Fat: 0<br />Total Fat: 0<br />Cholesterol: 5mg<br />Sodium: 180mg<br />Potassium: 55mg<br />Carbs: 10g<br />Sugars: 8g<br />Protein: 2.5<br /><br />Warnings: Contains milk and soy. Manufactured in a facility that processes eggs, wheat, tree nuts, fish, crustaceans, and shellfish products.  Wait what?!?<br /><br />Honestly that is a strange mixture of products to be pushing through the same facilities.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />I tried this product according to the instructions and can report that the product desolves fairly easily into cold water and definitly tastes like lemonade although there is a hint of creamy flavor on the backend that is neither welcome nor a deal-breaker.  there is a certain weight to these drink powders I notice with Endurox as well which is why I never mix it into just 12oz of water,  typically I will mix it into 21oz or more; besides who carries around only 12oz of water?  I dont know if dilluting it into more water has any kind of negative effect on the product ability to produce results but I doubt it.  All in all I find this product just as useful as any other recovery drink and the packaging very convenient to throw in the gym bag; although I find throwing a shaker bottle with a servings worth of dry powder into my gym bag just as convenient and much cheaper than the $1.75 I spent on this one serving.<br /><br />Comparing it directly to Endurox R4 I can appreciate the benefit of lower calories and sugar however I would like to try Endurox R4 Restore and compare the Nutritional info on both before making any blanket statements as to my preferance of one over the other.  That being said Accelerade is the only one available in a lemonade flavor which is a nice change from the barrels of fruit punch Endurox I have been going through.

review/summary: I Have Definitely Noticed A Difference
review/text: I bought Accelerade Hydro (Lemonade Flavor) because it seemed like the best substitute for the P90X Results and Recovery Formula. It features the same 4-1 Carbs to Protein formula to allow for quick muscle recovery after a taxing workout, and the taste is very easy to get used to. I haven't tried the P90X Results and Recovery or the Fruit Punch flavor of Accelerade Hydro, so I have no basis for comparison on that topic.<br /><br />However, I can definitely say, I've noticed a huge difference in how I feel after my workouts. Before Accelerade Hydro, I had the all-too-familiar muscle soreness the next day - where almost any time I moved - I would experience some form of pain in my muscles (what the trainers like to call, "that good pain"). While I'm used to that - being someone who's played sports my entire life - it's not fun, and it makes pushing yourself hard the next day, less desirable. I like to be excited for my workouts, not dreading them. The soreness is still there, but it's nowhere near as prevalent. I'd say it went from an 80% down to about 15%...Seriously.<br /><br />The label says you can drink this before, during or after your workouts, but I definitely prefer right after. The only reason I don't like drinking it during, is because it doesn't rinse my mouth of that thick saliva like water does. Plus, it's kind of like a little treat right after I'm finished.<br /><br />Be sure to drink this within an hour of finishing your workout. It'll benefit you the most in that time period. Also, to respond to what someone else mentioned about a scoop not being in the tub, it's supposed to come with one. When you get the tub, it should have a seal underneath the screw-off top (similar to ketchup, kinda...you get the idea). So if you get your tub and it isn't sealed, I would send it back for an exchange.<br /><br />Overall, I love this stuff. I'm thinking of stocking up just so I don't have to worry about ordering for a few months. Also note: it's 50 servings! Results and Recovery tub is half that and about twice as expensive on Amazon.<br /><br />Enjoy!
