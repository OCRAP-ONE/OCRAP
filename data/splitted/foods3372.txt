review/summary: It's decent,  but expensive........
review/text: I bought a case and drank one every afternoon at work. I am not sure if it was the placebo effect, but it seemed to give me a little afternoon lift whereas I would normally be dragging. The taste is probably not for everyone. I gave one to a coworker and she gagged. I drink it over lots of ice and find it to be tasty, albeit probably an acquired taste. In any event, it was too expensive to drink every day so I stopped. Might pick up another case in the future.

review/summary: Sceptic won over
review/text: You are receiving this from the world's biggest skeptic. My 13-year-old son convinced me to buy four of your Brain Toniq drinks at Wholefoods even though I told him it was a big joke to think a drink could make you focus any clearer or have any positive effect whatsoever. We each drank one of your drinks around 2:30 pm. I couldn not believe it--I felt clear headed, in a great mood all afternoon and evening. I felt "sharp" in two business meetings that afternoon and actually forgot I had taken one of the drinks. My 17-year-old son commented about my great mood and why was I so happy? It was then that it dawned on me that my day was no different than most, except for the Brain Toniq drink. My skeptism kicked in again. The drink could not be responsible for how I felt.<br /><br />So the next day I took another one of the drinks and again, same great mood, same happy feeling, same sharpness of thought and my entire family noticed. Wow! If anyone thinks this is just another marketing ploy or scam to get people to buy some kind of energy drink, forget it...this is the REAL deal. You have my permission to let anyone read my email to you or even inquire with me! Finally a company that actually delivers on their promise. Thank you so much! (By the way, we went back and cleaned out Wholefood's inventory, HA!)<br /><br />Ray Ramirez<br /><br />Highlands Ranch, Colorado

review/summary: Great Choice for Non-Caffeine Alternative
review/text: On my quest for a new type of energy drink that is more natural and doesn't contain caffeine, corn syrup, fructose, taurine, and all the other "unnatural" ingredients most energy drinks contain, I stumbled across Brain Toniq. I read many reviews(Amazon) on this drink before I made my order. From what I read I had HIGH expectations and after ordering a pack of 24, I can honestly say, I wasn't let down.<br /><br />First off, you gotta love the flavor of this drink. It's got a nice, smooth, clean citrus flavor that just makes you want to sip on this stuff all day. I LOVE it!! You'll be done with the 8.4 oz can before you know it and wishing you had more to sip on (my only complaint).<br /><br />Secondly, once consumed, the drink gives me almost an immediate mental edge bordering on a comparison between DVD to BluRay quality (for all you TV enthusiasts out there). It's not some huge "rush", but slight and enough for you to feel like you just got a great 8 hrs of consistent sleep. If I had to describe it in 2 words, it would be like a "Brain Refresh".<br /><br />With that being said, Brain Toniq is NOT going to give you a surge of energy, nor is it going to speed your brain up to the point where it turns you into a complete "tweeker". It is nice and steady with no burnout.<br />Brain Toniq is also not going to keep you up when you have 3 hrs of sleep and are looking to stay up for a longer period of time. It may help a little, but I have personally found that if I'm very tired (lacking much sleep) then I can fall asleep on this stuff. What it DOES do is improve your mental focus and thought process a bit when you may be suffering from "brain fog".<br /><br />I wouldn't really classify it as an energy drink, so if you purchase this under that assumption, then you'll be sadly disapointed. Brain Toniq doesn't even mention the words "energy drink" on their can and I truly believe they don't want you to think of them as one. Their labeled the "organic think drink" and that is exactly what it is. If your looking for a refreshing drink to give you a nice little mental boost through out the day, then this is the drink for you.<br /><br />TIP: If you'd like an extra "turbo boost" of mental and physical energy that's 100% natural to combine with Brain Toniq, try Panax Ginseng pills/shots. This will give you that added benefit of energy and mental power.

review/summary: BrainToniq Rocks!!
review/text: Very seldom do I ever write reviews on new products..however, I happened to come across BrainToniq at my grocery store and decided to give it a try.  Im not a fan whatsoever of carbonated drinks including sodas but I was won over my BrainToniq's smoothness and above all taste! It does not have stimulating effects but provides a noticeable charge of energy and a sense of calmness and stamina.  Very surprising that a product delivers what it claims...very rare.  The only downside is the price but what it delivers justifies the cost. Worth a try..even for the taste.

review/summary: Rating on taste & effect on thought, NOT price
review/text: I did not buy a case of this, I bought a couple at Sunflower Markets to try out.<br />In spite of what I've read others say, it tastes good.  However, it's not like your buying this for something tasty.  It helps me when I drink this, as I have a brain fog that tides away for the most part when I drink this.  I've stopped and it slowly comes back.  That being said, for $2.00-$2.50/daily, a little expensive for 8.4 oz.  (1 Cup)<br />At sunflower markets, it was 2 for 5.00, which is where I got the $2.50 price tag.<br /><br />You figure 1 month being 30 days, $2 would be $60.  Then again, I guess some people do smoke cigarettes at around $50/carton, so it's not a far stretch for some...

review/summary: Seems to prevent brain fog, but nothing spectacular
review/text: I've been on the Brain Toniq (1 can a day) for 2 months, with a pause of 1 week while traveling. My diet is healthy (exclusively from Trader Joe's or Whole Foods), includes chicken meat and seafood, but no beef, pork, trans fats, sodas, chips or junk food. Here's what I noticed since I've been on Brain Toniq:<br /><br />* In the very first weeks, I noticed random memory improvement. However, that was not remarkable, and not constant. If I suddenly had a significant memory boost, I would've noticed.<br /><br />* In the first three weeks, I observed less brain fog during the afternoon.<br /><br />* In the following month, my daily health log showed no brain fog.<br /><br />The latter is an improvement that I can attribute to Brain Toniq. At some point in the future I plan to go off Brain Toniq for two weeks and see if the brain fog comes back.<br /><br />UPDATE (2 years later): I haven't had brain fog in 6 months, without using Brain Toniq or anything equivalent really. It turned out that the brain fog was caused by being assigned dreadful projects at work, and trying not to procrastinate on them, despite not believing in their goals.

review/text: I first tried this product from Whole Foods and instantly liked the clean, refreshing citrus flavor. Since then I had a few dozen but I didn't really notice anything significant in terms of a lift although I have to say I have been getting plenty of sleep since I bought a big box of these. So it's mostly a good and thankfully a small amount of really refreshing soda.

review/text: Not a miracle but, in my experience there is no such thing when it comes to these drinks. I will say that does seem to give a mental lift and I really like the taste, it's different.<br /><br />I'd probably buy it a lot more often if it cost less. I wouldn't mind drinking one of these every day but even with free shipping $44 is not much cheaper than the average $2 a can it usually goes for at the store. Pricey for 8.4 ounces.

review/summary: chemo brain
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00128DPT2">Brain Toniq, the Non-caffeinated Think Drink</a><br /><br />Most aren't aware of the damage chemo can do to your brain (it's called "chemo brain"). It not only fights to kill the gremlin but attacks other cells as well. I've been on a search for any energy/focus drink that's natural with no artificial sugars (bad for anyone) for 2 years. This one is my favorite.<br /><br />It cost a bit more ($44 a case is the best price I've found, no shipping fees) but it doesn't have the icky, sweet, over-flavored taste of most similar products on the market. The only way I can get those products to taste close to Brain Toniq is to cut them 1/2 club soda (or any fizzy water) and 1/2 energy drink. This works well & gives you more to drink for 1/2 the price & 1/2 the calories. With Brain Toniq I can grab it and go.<br /><br />* Focus is noticeably improved.<br />* Even maneuvering through traffic is noticeably improved.<br />* Brain Toniq works for me.

review/summary: Great product! ...but pricy.
review/text: Brain Toniq is an interesting product. I love the fact that it is an energy drink and focus enhancer without all of the additives and caffeine. However, I'm still not exactly sure what gives this product its effectiveness. There's no major amounts of vitamin B or no ingredients like taurine or guarana, so what is it? I don't know, but I do know the ingredients are good and that it works. That's good enough for me.<br /><br />The down side to this product is its very pricy, especially considering the drinks only have one major ingredient, agave nectar. So why charge $2 a can for it? I guess they just can. If they can continue to succeed with this product at that price then I commend them for their marketing abilities.<br /><br />Overall this is a 5 star product with 3 stars for price.

review/summary: A Smart Choice to Fuel Your Brain
review/text: On a whim, I purchased this item at a grocery store.  I needed something to give me clarity, focus, and motivation to complete my graduate school coursework.  Within an hour of consuming this drink, my mind felt sharper; I was more productive, calmer, and accomplished a great deal within a few hours.<br /><br />I have consumed other energy drinks and I must say that this drink triggers a state of mental acuity without the potential pitfalls of caffeine, sugar, and chemically produced ingredients.  It appears to be made from wholesome/natural compounds like nectar, citrus extracts, and other super rich nutrients.<br /><br />In short, it's a "smart" choice for the body, mind and your pocketbook.  It's a great price at $44, with free shipping.  Per drink, it's much cheaper than what I paid at the grocery store!<br /><br />Highly recommended for students and professionals who work mentally demanding jobs!

review/summary: This Does Work
review/text: I failed my Biology class with a D. I try my best and I still do very bad. After failing I thought maybe I have ADHD.  I'm always late, disorganized, and make careless mistakes. I found a list that attributes what I have<br /><br />poor organizational skills (home, office, desk, or car is extremely messy and cluttered)<br />tendency to procrastinate<br />trouble starting and finishing projects<br />chronic lateness<br />frequently forgetting appointments, commitments, and deadlines<br />constantly losing or misplacing things (keys, wallet, phone, documents, bills)<br />underestimating the time it will take you to complete tasks<br /><br />Despite getting a D on my Biology class, I passed one test. I had bought one of these before one of my test to prepare for it. I was very skeptical but it seemed like it worked. I didn't feel any difference. I got an 83 on that test. I had not realized that it was this drink that helped till the end of the semester because well I thought it was just an easy test, and no. Many of the ingredients were important for helping me focus such as DMAE.<br /><br />You may buy DMAE separately but I think DMAE is one of the most important ingredients in this drink to help you focus. I truly think that the ingredients in the drink will help you but most importantly DMAE.<br /><br />So perhaps I have ADHD but if DMAE will continue to focus I think that is a great alternative than Adderall to help me focus. Till then I will continue taking supplements unless DMAE stops working I will take visit to my Doctor. Its a shame that I may have ADHD but a huge discovery because I have been not doing well in my classes and I'm continuously late, and have all the symptoms above.<br /><br />Oh yeah also Rhodlia Roea mimics Adderall in a very weak way. "Rhodiola rosea's effects are potentially mediated by changes in serotonin and dopamine levels due to monoamine oxidase inhibition and its influence on opioid peptides such as beta-endorphin,although these specific neurochemical mechanisms have not been clearly documented with scientific studies. "From Wikipedia<br /><br />"amphetamines also cause an increase in dopamine in between the neurons in your brain. dopamine is a neurotransmitter which means that it is a chemical necessary for different brain cells to communicate with each other. by increasing the amount of dopamine between neurons, it allows the brain cells to increase efficiency which causes a general sense of being energetic and usually makes it easier to pay attention, learn things, etc..." From Yahoo Answers<br /><br />Also in addition to DMAE and I recommend L-tyrosine which supposedly increases Dopamine, epinephrine, and non epinephrine.<br /><br />Also please explain to me how my review was not helpful in the comment section. I do not believe that I have not helpful as I gave a thorough review. So if you have doubts let me know. If you think this review is fake let me help you out with that by getting rid of your doubts. Also I clearly list the ingredients and their functions on what they do to your brain so this drink works. The only draw back is the price.

review/summary: Still Not Sure
review/text: Before buying a big case, I decided to buy a can from Whole Foods to try first. Tonight was the tester - I am up working as usual and it is 12;40 am. I took Brain Toniq about an hour ago. First of all, it's a very refreshing drink, with a tropical-fruity flavor and kind of a perfumey aftertaste. I liked it.<br /><br />However, as far as "effectiveness" ... I should know better but I had high hopes that this beverage would help me not hit a wall and get sleepy at this point in the evening. But eyes are heavy and I'm just about to give up and just go to bed in a few minutes. Sadly, it didn't work for me. I may give another can a try to take to class to see if I retain the day's lesson better.<br /><br />It sounds like a great idea and I'm sure it works for some people - just not me ao far.

review/summary: Very Gummy Absent Flavor
review/text: I am a fairly good cook and had no issues with the preparation.  The texture was dissappointing.  I boiled the gnocchi as instructed, then sauted it with onions, garlic, and butter.  A little parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper was added.  The gnocchi did have a strong whole wheat taste, but the texture was gummy.  Once the product cooled some, the texture did slightly improve.  I will use the remainder of my 6-pack order of gnocchi, but I will try another method of preparation to impove on the taste.  Unfortunately, I don't know if this gummy texture is inherent of gnocchi, since I have never eaten fresh gnocchi.  I cannot recommend this product.  I prefer a good whole wheat penne.

review/summary: FINALLY, bacon that really tastes like bacon!
review/text: If you're older than 30 or so, you have probably noticed that the bacon in supermarkets is getting worse and worse as it gets more and more expensive. The texture is weird, and the flavor is unappetizing. I have tried every brand of bacon around, looking for the bacon I remember from my youth. I've been to butcher shops, I've been to Costco, I've tried every brand on the supermarket shelf, and I even once spent $14.99 on a pound of artisanal organic nitrite-free (and thus grey) bacon. None of it had that straightforward quality of great bacon: cooks up to a great, crunchy strip without burning, and tastes like pork and salt, with no "off" flavors.<br /><br />Rejoice, bacon lovers! Burgers' bacon nails it. It tastes like Oscar Meyer used to taste about 20 years ago. Unfortunately, this is a lot more expensive than supermarket bacon, but hey, it's not like I gobble the stuff by the pound. If you're going to eat bacon in the first place, you might as well go "whole hog" (excuse the expression) and get something that delights you.<br /><br />All the flavors are medium-thick sliced and quite meaty. No fatback-with-a-streak-of-meat "bacon" here.<br /><br />I ordered my sampler directly from Burgers' before I realized Amazon had the same thing for the same price. It was delivered in under a week, in styrofoam coolers thoroughly filled with ice packs.<br /><br />(Oh, and if you're hesitating about the health aspects of buying so much fatty pork, don't -- may I recommend the excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307949435">Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It</a>? You already know bacon gladdens your heart, and now there's scientific proof that it's good for your cardiac health as well! Enjoy!)

review/text: I always purchase bags on board to pick up my puggles poop. I normally buy the blue bags but decided to purchase the colorful ones because they were a couple dollars cheaper at the time. I guess these bags are defective because I have had a few of the bags open on the wrong end and my hand went all the way through. This is not good when you are about to pick up poo. So I don't know if it was just a bad batch or what but I will definitely go back to buying the blue bags as I have never had a problem with those ones.

review/summary: These bags used to be good
review/text: I open up my new bag of 360 today and take my 2 110lb dogs for a walk.  I open up the bag to pick up my dog's droppings to find out the damn bag has been shortened.  What a HUGE PIA.  Not only are they shorter, they are also thinner.  What a complete waste of money, now I have 358 bags that I have no need for.  Looks like it's time to find another bag for my dogs.

review/summary: My Hand Thanks These Bags
review/text: I have an 80 lbs Greyhound that poops like a horse.  He can easily fill a bag on a single walk.  The bags are the right size and have not torn.  Nothing is worse than using a bag to quickly realize you are literally picking up dog doo with a naked hand.  These have saved my hand from the cheap bags my wife keeps buying from the pet store.<br /><br />You could put a softball in these things.

review/summary: Great Bags
review/text: Our family got two greyhounds last year, so we needed to have something that would pick up A LOT of poop.  These poop bags are great!  I have never once gotten poop on myself, which I am quite grateful for.  The bags have never broken, and I have used them for some pretty sharp, frozen poop!<br /><br />I do not use the dispenser along with these bags.  I just buy the bags and bring the roll with me on walks.  They are fairly inexpensive as well, which is great when you have at least 4 poops a day, 7 days a week.<br /><br />The last thing I would comment on is that a tightened bag does not hold the smell in completely.  I didn't expect that it would when I bought them, but I wanted to make sure that anyone buying them knows this.

review/summary: Picking up poop made easy
review/text: Before I got my puppy, I was collecting plastic bags (instead of using my reusable cloth bags) from grocery stores to pick up my puppy's poop.  I refuse to be one of those people who think that dog poop will melt into the sidewalk after a certain period of time.  I also do not want to be blamed for starting the next Black Plague if dog poop could start a plague like that.<br /><br />In comes this `bags on board' bone thing stocked with bags for like $4.  I'm thinking, "Well, $4 is less than the price of a Bacardi and Diet...why not?!"  Man.  I am not looking back.  For some reason, my puppy pooped her way through all 30 bags in a little over a week.  Good for her... I guess?  So I had to re-up.  I almost went with stuffing plastic grocery bags in the bone and then decided that $7 was worth 120 convenient poop bags.  They fit perfectly into the bone.  The bone is not bothersome on the leash.  And, most important, I never forget a bag!  I don't really care about the colors and I don't see a quality difference between these and the `regular' blue bags.  The bags are not super thick, but my fingers have not broken through the plastic and poop has not come through the plastic.<br /><br />I am conscious of the destruction waste causes.  I do recycle.  I do wish that these were biodegradable.  But, instead of collecting the big grocery bag plastic bags, I am going to use these smaller bags for poop and my cloth bags for groceries.  Right now, the bags are a little big for my puppy, but I am sure she will grow into them...gross.

I ordered these for a change of pace; they are more transparent than the originals, which wouldn't bother me except they are also not as sturdy.

review/summary: Bags split open
review/text: Several of the rolls of bags were defective, so that individual bags split along the seams. This would obviously lead to some very messy clean ups, that were more like using a piece of ripped saran wrap (no surefire hand protection) than a bag. Sticking with the trusted blue ones, which I haven't had an issue with.<br /><br />Also, these are definitely normal, plastic bags. They are not biodegradable.

review/summary: Never had a doggie waste bag fall apart before
review/text: I used most of the rolls in this pack without a problem, but recently I started a new purple roll and two bags I pulled off the roll tonight immediately tore open.  I took out a third and it started to tear from the top, but I managed to be delicate enough with it that I could use it to pick up after my dog without having a mess on my hands (literally). I've never had this happen before, but I won't buy these bags again!  I can't be caught outside without a way to pick up after my dog and I certainly don't want to risk using bags that will tear just trying to open them.

review/text: I am currently a contractor in Afghanistan, and we use porta-potties and toilet units that absolutely cannot handle anything but toilet paper.  These bags are a GREAT solution for what to do with one's feminine products.  Large enough to handle each change, but small enough to not be wasteful, inexpensive, and fun, friendly colors make these an excellent solution to one of life's little problems.<br /><br />I'd imagine they are also good for doggie poo ...

(both were bags on board brand)<br /><br />These bags are very similar to those ones, but harder to open.<br /><br />It's not that big of a deal, when I need more bags I would buy these again, but if it is the same price as the light blue ones I would buy those instead (which I why I gave 4 stars instead of 5). But if these were cheaper I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again.

review/summary: visible at night so neighbors don't panic or glare
review/text: I like these bags for night use (especially the<br />coveted yellow and bright green ones.  Orange is<br />third best and purple doesn't help.  When I have<br />yellow or green, they are easier to see at night<br />as I walk my dog and neighbors are more likely to<br />relax and get in their house, rather than stick around<br />to watch me pass by.<br /><br />I always pick up after my dog.  However, in my neighborhood<br />there are people who open their door and let the dogs out to<br />go where they please unsupervised.  Or there are stealth walkers<br />that let their dog go, then walk off, without picking up.<br />I don't like finding others' surprises on my lawn either,<br />so using bags is a must to be a good neighbor.<br /><br />PROS: Bags on Board are well made, I don't feel like the<br />moisture is going through the bag onto my hand like I did<br />with another brand. As mentioned before, the bright yellow<br />and green are great for night use.<br /><br />CONS:  Unlike the blue bags on board, these are a thinner material<br />and seem to stick closed.  The bags are all attached on a roll, so<br />after tearing free one bag, I usually rub the top bag edge  between<br />my hands very fast and try to get the bag to separate, then when it<br />gives a little and I see that milimeter of separation at the top of<br />the bag, I carefully pry it apart and open the bag fully.  This is<br />BEFORE I go out with the dog at night, because in the dark, I'd never<br />be able to see the milimeter separation and pry the bag open it timely.<br />It takes awhile to rub the bag material and get it finally opened.<br />Blue bags by contrast are easy to open without having to rub.<br /><br />I will continue to buy these bags and the blue ones, but because of the<br />difficulty getting the bags open, I have to rate this at 3 stars<br /><br />UPDATE - dampen one finger before you rub the edge of the bag and it<br />sticks a little, making it easier to open the bag

At 5 am it is especially nice that these bags tear evenly, neatly, and easily along the perforations, and that the opening has dark bars making it easily distinquished.  With this kind of cheap convenience there is no excuse for not picking-up after your dog.

review/summary: Cheery bags for a dirty deed
review/text: As the title says, these are cheery bags for a dirty deed.<br /><br />One bag usually suffices to take care of the business done by two 25 kilo dogs. I'd estimate the bag rupture/burst/break/tear rate at a little under 0.5%, which is acceptable considering the cost and how thin they are - usually it's just a small tear.<br /><br />Sometimes it's a little tough to open the bag, I suggest pinching the end with your fingers and rubbing back and forth to make it easier. Usually a bit of moisture helps that as well. We usually just use the pinch method before knotting the bag to the handle of the leash, then when it's business time it's simple to address things quickly without fumbling to open the bag.<br /><br />Good deal, worth the money. Love the colors.

They've got the Bags on Board logo printed on them. They're pretty sheer, so if you don't want to be obvious about what you're carrying, go with a black bag. I usually put an extra one under the roll, so that I don't unexpectedly run out.

Defective. Also, these bags are hard to open in the cold as we can't figure out where the opening is each time & it doesn't initially open easily when rubbed together to find the opening. Overall, ok for the cost (although, I think I found similar cost at Home Goods with cute colors too). One note for "big" dog owners; these bags are small. It's ok for us as we have mini dogs.

They will tear if you throw them against wall etc. Bright colors also make it easier to see, and also more fun.<br />I have been using them for over a year now and very satisfied with them.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: These bags started off okay... but once we got to the 3rd refill we began to notice that many of the bags either a) didn't open at all or b) both ends were open! We figured maybe it was just one refill, but in four of these refills we have had the same problem. We had to throw away about 1/3 of the bags or try to use them even though they are defective. Will not be buying these in the future.

review/summary: Excellent quality
review/text: Great quality of bags.  colorful.  easy to insert into the dog-bag-holder.<br />Remember, the bags must be thin enough to fit a large number of them in the roll, and thick enough so you dont feel like you're picking up poop with your bare hands!  as far as picking up poop, the thicker the better! We purchased another product from Amazon with a LARGE NUMBER OF BAGS for ~25, and while it was much cheaper than THIS product, the bags are so thin that its really nasty to pick up the poop.

review/summary: Good bags, great price on Amazon!
review/text: These bags are pretty handy to have.  They beat trying to use recycled grocery bags (which often have holes in them that you only notice once you're out on your walk).  The bags are thin but pretty sturdy.  Some reviews complain that they are too big, but I have a small dog and don't find that to be the case.  They are long enough that you can tie them in a knot, any shorter and this would be tough.  Overall a good buy and a much better price than you would find in the pet store!

They also tear off well and open well. I've had some before that drove me nuts because when I tore one it tore the bag and it took me forever to open it. These work well for me.  As for the colors, the dogs could care less, but I like them!

When the bags arrived, they were clearly different from the originals that we received as a gift, so my wife called the company and learned they had changed the chemistry of the plastic, and they are no longer biodegradeable.  They said that the EPA requires that anything in a biodegradeable package must be compostable, and they do not recommend that animal waste be composted.

review/summary: I may have gotten a bad batch...
review/text: I originally got these in the 1 pound bag and they were great! Perfect condition, great assortment, neatly wrapped individually. The candy itself is amazing. If I were rating the 1lb bag, it would absolutely be 5/5 stars. But this review is about the 3lb bag and NOT the 1lb one (I mention this because the same seller lists both bags in a single listing). I decided to get the 3lb bag and I was terribly disappointed. Over 75% of the bag was one flavor, the bag was a cheap generic bag which split open in shipping (the 1lb was in a very nice, tough, and resealable bag), the individually wrapped candies themselves were covered in an unknown sticky residue, and many of the candies were either 1/2 piece or 1&1/2 pieces inside the wrappers. It seems the 3lb bag contains the rejects from the 1lb bag.  Maybe I just got a bad batch? I guess I will return it.<br /><br />Edit: the seller has been very helpful and explained that the batch I got was likely damaged in transit, and has verified that the 3lb bag is the same quality at the 1lb and that I likely got a bad batch which could be returned. And so I will return them and purchase another to see, as the candies themselves are amazing enough for me to mention that they are amazing twice in the same review. Hopefully the next ones won't have the same issues.

review/summary: My favorite coffee for a while
review/text: I've been drinking the breakfast blend for two years now. Every now and then I'll change up and do a different brand of coffee, but I always come back to this one because it's perfectly balanced to my tastes. The reviewers here saying it's too bitter really surprise me. The lack of bitterness is exactly what I love about it. I can make it strong without ruining the flavor. I guess everyone's taste buds are different. Mine were raised on cheap grocery store coffees, and this stuff is miles better in comparison.<br /><br />If you like Community Coffee, keep your eyes open for coupons here. There's usually one for $3 off every few months.

review/summary: Worst coffee ever, dump them all in the garbage
review/text: The worst coffee I ever bought. As soon as I opened the bag, I know what a terrible mistake I made buying three bags of cheap coffee. It smelled foul, it expires within 1 month of purchase, and it definitely contains more than just grounded coffee beans (leaves, branches etc). But I still tried to brew the coffee, I brewed one with a french press, terrible taste. And then I tried to brew it with a Moka, still terrible. So now they are where they belong, the garbage bin. I don't know if my three bags of coffee all happened to be outliers, but I just cannot agree with the other reviews.

review/summary: Believe The Reviewers Who Complain About Imminent Expiration Dates!
review/text: I should've paid attention to the reviewers who warned that their coffee arrived shortly before the marked expiration dates on the bags.  Mine did as well.  No way I'll go through the three bags in time.  For that reason, and the fact that this coffee tastes no better than what you'd get at your corner gas station, I'm cancelling my Subscribe and Save order. One other thing I should've checked out: the majority of the five star reviews are the only product the reviewers ever reviewed.  Must be a Community Coffee Employee Incentive Plan.
