review/summary: Allergy Westie
review/text: My westie has food allergies and has had tummy problems since a puppy. He had soft stools and was gassy. I fed him really good food. He started scratching, licking paws, and getting waxy yeasty ears. He would vomit first thing in the morning. These are all signs of food allergies. I tried the grain free foods. They seemed to help but he still had problems. I changed his food to one brand and he got very sick to the point he had to spend a couple days at the vets. My vet recomended the California Natural no Grain. My dog is doing so much better. His stools are normal, almost no gas, and his itching is almost gone. If he does get grain like a stray cracker or cheerio he is a sorry puppy (he just turned one) for a couple of days. I'm so happy my vet recommended it and it is available at other places too.

review/summary: Helped with allergies
review/text: I switched to this food to try and eliminate food allergies.  After spending hundreds of dollars at the vet for my dog who wouldn't stop licking his paws raw.  Within 3 weeks he stopped licking and his hair stopped falling out.  I also mixed this dry food with EVO 95% venison in a can. I took about a week to slowly switch over to the new food. So now his only protein was venison and all grain free. The food is expenspensive but cheaper than weekly vet visits and giving him steroids/sprays/baths.  Make sure you don't give your dog anything else like rawhides, treats or table food.

review/summary: Excellent product, outrageous price
review/text: One of my dogs is restricted to 21% protein or less and another has food allergies.  This is the only dry, grain-free food I could find with low enough protein or I wouldn't have paid so much.  The dogs all love it and most are showing improvement since going grain-free but I'm still looking for less expensive alternatives.  The venison doesn't work for the dog with food allergies.  He seems to do better with poultry.

review/text: If your dog is scratching and itching, please triple your dog's exercise and let him/her have some excitement ( A different road, a few different lanes, even a nature-spot where he/she can be off leash to feel free.)  Science says a small risk 'mastered' is great for humans, and science also says the same for dogs. The most nutritious, least tiring food helps. A lot. Great good can happen when small risks are mastered--both for humans and canines. Baby steps lead to mastery. Good nutrition helps a lot. Good, great food, no grains, and lots of chemical-free proteins add to life, Chemicals are hard on the liver and kidneys. Older dogs might need chemical drugs--but younger dogs might have options. Explore chemical-free options if your dog is young,<br />We'll all be old--let's not make our dogs older before their time with food.

I purchased Ghirardelli Squares Milk Chocolate with Caramel Filling because others have recommended them.<br /><br />These candies are special - genuine chocolate that  slowly melts in my mouth.  Then after savoring the sweet chocolate, the caramel drifts onto my taste buds.  I like the caramel filling.  The candy is smooth and tasty.  I noticed that Ghirardelli has other candies with different fillings.  I may try them all (one small piece at a time).<br /><br />I recommend these chocolates.<br />.

review/summary: Skimps on chicken
review/text: These are the typical rawhides wrapped with chicken, and seem slightly higher quality than the kind you get at the dollar store.  But they really skimp on the chicken, so you it's mainly a rawhide twist with a shred of chicken on it.  My dogs go crazy when I give them one but their enthusiasm diminishes when the chicken's gone and with these treats, the chicken vanishes FAST (and my dogs are TINY). So they're great if your dogs loves rawhides and would enjoy the extra zip of chicken flavor but if your dog gets bored with plain rawhide, the joys of this treat will be over in a few seconds.  I'll be looking for a brand that delivers a meatier product.

review/summary: Nonni's Chocolate Biscotti
review/text: Actually, I love Nonni's chocolate biscotti and would buy them at my local grocer if they had them.  I found these listed at Amazon and ordered two containers.  When they arrived which was during the warmest part of the summer, most of the chocolate frosting had melted and flowed onto the plastic packaging which made eating them very messy.  The worst part which didn't seem to be caused by the heat was that virtually every one of the biscotti's were broken into multiple parts which I attribute to rough handling. I don't know whether this rough handling occurred at Amazon or by the shipper.  I have always liked to buy from Amazon but won't buy any more biscotti.

review/summary: Hot Enough to be "The Source" of the Big Bang!!!
review/text: I just started "officially" collecting hot sauces / extracts this year...2010. Although I just started collecting as a "hobby", I've been a fan of hot foods for decades. Plus, I've grown many different peppers including but not limited to jalape&ntilde;o, Cayenne, and Haba&ntilde;ero.<br /><br />I thought I knew "hot"...until I tried "The Source Collectors Extract". This extract is rated at a nuclear 7,100,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU)!! I've tried it both as a food additive and directly on my tongue (DO NOT TRY THE LATTER). This stuff is the hottest of ANY sauce / extract I've ever had...and I've had a lot. There has been a few close seconds but they just didn't quite have the same peak heat or staying power. "The Source" is hot instantly and you think, "WOW, this IS HOT", but then it creeps up on you even more until your reaching for some milk...ice cream...water...anything to make it stop!!!<br /><br />This is my personal favorite and I highly recommend "The Source" to anyone who is a true hot pepper enthusiast.<br /><br />Five Stars!!!

review/text: In fairness to the product itself, I did taste it and it does taste good. However, I couldn't get over the fact that there was no safety seal or tamper evident seal. I know I'm probably too paranoid, but in this day and age I like to see some type of safety seal on products I'm going to consume. I think that there should at least be a button that pops up when you open the bottle. But that's just me. The order came in 6 bottles. I didn't return them, because the next buyer would have absolutely no evidence that I opened one of the bottles. So it's a loss to me. Oh well, I guess it's one of the risks of ordering from the internet, not being able to inspect the packaging before purchase.

review/summary: Baby hated solids until I tried NuturMe!
review/text: We started our son on solids when he was six months. The first "food" we introduced was rice cereal as recommended by our pediatrician. We tried every day for 2 weeks to feed my son rice cereal and then oatmeal cereal but he hated both! He'd refuse the food by turning away and keeping his mouth tightly shut. I was at my wits end and gave him a break because I knew I had to be patient. I was never a huge fan of the idea of feeding my son rice cereal so I went searching for something that was convenient and came in small portions. I didn't want to feed my son the traditional baby food from a jar due to the risk of BPA found in the jar lids. Luckily, I found NurturMe! My son loved it from the start.  We started with the peas and then worked our way through the apple, squash, and sweet potato.<br /><br />Here is what I love about NuturMe Baby Food:<br /><br />CONVENIENCE. The food comes in BPA-FREE paper pouches that are easy to travel with. They contain the same amount of food as a 2.5oz jar of baby food. When we first started my son on solids he ate 1/2 pouch at each feeding. We saved the rest in the fridge and fed the the rest at his second feeding. It states on the packaging that they can last 2-3 days refrigerated. I personally only trust 24 hours if prepared with formula and 2-3 days if made with water. This is because it states on the formula can that prepared formula should be discarded after 24 hours. If I still breastfed, I would trust breastmilk to last 2-3 days as well.<br /><br />TASTE. Although the food is quick dried, it tastes fresh! The peas actually taste like peas and they are actually bright green, like they should be. I've tried the foods myself before I first fed them to my son and they passed my taste test! I also love that the baby food is organic. This is very important to me that everything my son eats is free of pesticides. I am conscious about what I eat, it shouldn't be any different for my son.<br /><br />MIX & MATCH. I love that you can mix and match the baby foods together to make new flavor profiles for the baby. I am all about introducing new foods to my baby and this is the perfect way to do it! Another great idea is to add juice to the baby food once your baby is 8+ months. When my son gets older I am going to try out adding pomegranate juice to the apple variety. I don't plan of giving my son juice to drink so this is a great way to introduce him to the flavor of pomegranate.<br /><br />ECO-FRIENDLY. The packaging to completely recyclable and doesn't take of the space that canned baby food does. That means a smaller carbon footprint! In addition, the packaging is BPA-FREE. I emailed the company and asked them before I purchased the product on Amazon.<br /><br />Here is the only issue I have with NurturMe:<br /><br />CONSISTENCY. I noticed that it can be difficult to mix the baby food together to get the desired consistency. For instance, the apple was really clumpy and hard before I added the water and I had a difficult time getting all of the clumps out. Its similar to mixing formula -- you have to take extra care! My remedy for this was to use a handheld milk frother and from then on I got the perfect consistency with no clumps! I've also noticed that the peas have a little bit of a grainy texture but my son doesn't seem to mind.<br /><br />I am definitely happy with NuturMe baby food. I think it is a quick and convenient way to serve my baby organic baby food for when we are on the go! It is the best alternative I have found to homemade baby food.

review/text: I had high expectations based on some reviews, but aside from the apple, these were mostly blech and my baby did not like them.  The consistency of the squashes was very pasty, and the peas tasted like powder.  I ended up just using them to sneak extra nutrition in other dishes (the squash wasn't bad mixed with mashed potatoes, but I couldn't put in too much or the little guy was on to me!).  The apple was actually a really nice consistency, a little bit of texture and tasted quite delicious.  I definitely recommend getting the variety pack before launching into a big box of one kind.  It's a great idea, but won't work for everyone.

review/summary: To say I LOVE this baby food is an understatement
review/text: At the age of about 4 months, my little boy stopped gaining weight and dropped from the 55th percentile to the 2nd very quickly.  I am SO GLAD that I found Nurturme at the time I did.  It allowed me to start introducing him to solid foods, while mixing it with breastmilk or formula, so not only was he getting the calories from the food, but from the milk as well.  After several months on Nurturme, he is gaining weight at a steady rate and we no longer have to be concerned about his growth.<br />I also have a SUPER picky 3 year old who won't touch a vegetable if I cover it in chocolate and call it a Twinkie.  I am able to add a packet or two of the Nurturme veggies to her mac & cheese or other foods to sneak her in some nutrition.  Now to try that on my husband...

review/summary: Sensible product, portable and versatile
review/text: There are many reasons to reconsider the first foods we give to babies.  The jars and the plastic containers for processed baby food are often difficult to recycle.  The processed food and the dried cereals (wheat, rice, etc.) are nothing more than empty carbs for a society facing a massive problem with the rise of type II diabetes.  Is this anything to give to a 4 month old baby?<br />To complicate matters, the World Health Organization is now recommending that babies feed on only breastmilk or formula until baby is 6 months.  The reason is that baby's small intestines cannot process the iron out of other foods until baby is six months.  As any parent can tell you, by four months of age, most babies are wanting to try other foods.<br />Nurturme baby food can help with all of this.  Each packet makes up about 2.75 oz of baby food, the same amount in a standard baby food container.  The freeze dried food is combined with breastmilk or formula, so baby can try new foods like peas, apples, squash or sweet potatoes and still get iron a form they can use, while eating a nutritious veggie instead of a starchy carb.  I know carbs are important, but they hardly seem like the best foods to introduce when energy can be supplied from formula or breastmilk.<br />The different foods can be combined to make up baby food, for example apples and sweet potatoes together.  Another versatility option is to add a little bit of nurturme to babies bottle, sort of like a baby food smoothy.<br />The freeze dried packets are super convenient.  They are easier to carry around and store than regular baby food.  After baby is six months, if a parent wanted to add water rather than milk or formula, they can.<br />The baby food tastes good, too.  Normal baby food peas tastes like horrible canned peas.  If you ever wondered why baby wouldn't eat peas, try tasting that nasty food.  The nurturme peas actually taste like fresh peas (yes, i tried them for myself). I tried all four foods in this pack, and they all tasted like fresh food.  I think that having good tasting, healthy food would be much better to introduce than nasty tasting food.  I am trying to develop good eating habits in my child, after all.

review/summary: By Far Our Favorite Baby Food
review/text: I ordered out of curiosity, but nurturme quickly became my favorite baby food. Now I'm on my third order. I've spent so much time staring at the baby food shelves and doing research online. I've tried Earths Best, Sprout, and Happy Baby, but I'm going to stick with Nutureme. First of all, my baby loves the taste. I love the small packaging, portability, and (most important for me) high nutritional value. I also like that it has more calories than other brands when you compare serving size. That tells me that other brands are watered down. My baby is small for his size, so I want him to have more calories per feeding. I'll feed my baby nuturme on its own or mixed with oatmeal cereal. Either way, it's super easy to use. My favorites are the apple, squash, and peas which seem exactly like their fresh counterparts. Unlike the other varieties, the dried sweet potatoes aren't as appealing as fresh. Sweet potatoes are so easy to make into baby food that I'd rather just make my own anyway. I probably wouldn't order the sweet potato version on its own, but I use it anyway as it's part of the variety pack.

review/summary: Best baby food ever!
review/text: My 6 month old baby absolutely loves this food, he smacks his slips every time I give it to him. Its so quick and easy to prepare I mix it with oatmeal or cereal and milk. Only downside is each package makes 2.5 oz, and its a bit pricey for me. But the quality of the food is superb! Its worth every penny! I don't use this daily since I make him his food, but this is a great substitute for on the go or last minute quick fix.

review/text: My 8 month old loves the food, especially the pumpkin (squash) and sweet potato.  I like it because it's easy to mix, organic, lightweight and environmentally friendly.  When she is older, I will use it in the other foods as well.  It tastes like "real" food, not "baby food".  It smells better too!

review/summary: Our favorite baby food!
review/text: We started our son on baby food a little after his 6 month birthday.  (he is almost 8 months now)  After introducing avocado and quinoa cereal, we tried NuturMe's squash, and it was a huge hit.  Same with the sweet potatoes, then the peas, then the apples.  I love that they are organic, they really do taste fresh and I much prefer to make it for him than give him jarred food.  I will often use a different spoon to mix it so I can lick some of it off, it tastes so good!  (the peas might be my favorite!)  Another reviewer was right, the peas end up being a bit grainy in texture; at first we just mixed it with a bit more water to make it smoother/more soupy, but now he eats it just fine at the 3 tbsp. of water mixture.  I just ordered some more as our stash was running out - a very sad thing!  I also want to try the "froggy pasta" recipe I saw on their blog.  I keep thinking of ways I want to use NurturMe after he's out of the puree stage.  I can't wait for them to introduce new flavors!

review/summary: Mother & Baby Approved
review/text: Granted, we haven't tried all of the other brands of organic baby foods, but this is certainly a GREAT product, especially for baby's first intro to solids. Each one smells & tastes amazingly fresh & good. Packets can be packed in the diaper bag & reconstituted with water or breast milk/formula to the desired consistency. My grandaughter looks like a baby bird with her mouth open waiting for the next bite. That wasn't the case with Earth's ____ brand that she rejected! She loves all of these, especially the squash.  That being said- this isn't inexpensive, so this subscribe & save plan for the variety pack is appreciated. Without that option, we might be searching for another brand- though I'm doubting we would find a better product. Waiting for the expanded 6 pack to be offerred that adds carrots & bananas.

review/summary: Great for picky toddlers!!!
review/text: My little boy is nearly two and has become an extremely picky eater.  The peas and carrots he used to love just get thrown on the floor and the little chunks of squash I give him - he spits them out and makes himself gag!  So, these pouches are my salvation!  I mix the powder with a little milk into macaroni and cheese and voila!  Now he eats macaroni and squash and cheese or macaroni and peas and cheese and we are both happy :)  The squash is also great mixed into spaghetti sauce.  It's just an added bonus that they can sit in the pantry without going bad for weeks or months so I always have some veggies on hand for him.

review/summary: cool concept, but expensive, in the end- just ok
review/text: i am constantly adding baby food to regular food [pumpkin, sweet potato into pancake mix; carrot, tomato, greens into spaghetti sauce; etc..].  so when i saw these i thought it would be a cool mix in without changing the consistency.<br /><br />tried the sweet potato into our pancake mix.  i couldn't taste them, nor did it change the color of the mix.  which for most older kids probably would be great.  however, my toddler calls them "orange pancakes," so we ended up dumping in a jar of sweet potatoes anyway to make them orange.<br /><br />also added the carrots to a 4 cheese noodles i made.  it colored them great and you couldn't taste the carrots.  so if you are trying to be sneaky, then these will work, it's a very, very small amount of powder, so it'll boost the nutrition without being detected.  with that said...<br /><br />in wegmans where i live, they were 1.10 a pouch.  i didn't think that was bad considering the organic packets  [plum/happybaby] are anywhere from 1.00-1.50.  EXCEPT, that nurturme is equivalent to a 2.5 ounce jar, NOT the typical FOUR oz!  this is equal to those 1st stage baby food jars that are tiny.  their picture seems a little deceptive, because i think when most people see a pic of a baby food jar they think of the normal size ones- not the tiny ones.<br /><br />so in the end, you are paying more and getting less.<br /><br />like i said, i didn't buy these to mix up and feed my baby, i just wanted to try as a mix in.  in all, i think it's a cool concept, but as for paying double for the same product, ehh dunno.  might buy a pack and use it here and there as a mix in.

review/summary: Had high hopes but this fell very short
review/text: I thought this sounded like the perfect solution for taking nutritious wholesome food with us for our 8 month old baby on our vacation out of the country where I am worried we won't have very many fruit and vegetable options.  I have been making my own baby food with organic ingredients for the last 2 months.  I was excited to get the package today and ripped open the sweet potatoes, one of my daughter's homemade favorites.  I was extremely disgusted by the smell of the powder but decided to put some water in and give it a try anyway (hoping that the hydration would somehow help the mixture).  I tried a bite and these don't even taste anything like sweet potatoes.  They are very dark brown and tasted like minerals and quite unnatural.  My daughter ate the two bites I gave her but I felt too guilty feeding her anymore and dumped out the bowl...and my garbage smells terrible now.

review/text: I bought this for the first time on Amazon a few weeks ago--the variety package and it was great (5 Stars)--powder was fresh and vibrant looking. Ran out of the peas--so thought I'd purchase it again--but without the variety pack--just the peas. This time--got a package that expires in May and the packaging was a bit different--which was fine--since it's only end of March right now--but when I opened it--the powder was stale looking (like sand)--whitish in color not the vibrant green and powder flew up in the air (like sawdust)--whereas it's usually more dense.  Too bad--my baby really liked the peas in the variety pack.

review/text: My husband and I both tasted the peas today and they were delicious!  Huge step up over other baby foods we've tried!  Just wish there were more flavors to choose from...<br /><br />However, we've stopped buying this product based on Amazon's RIDICULOUS amount of packaging for it.  One of the reason I liked this product was that I felt greener using a baby food without the glass jars.  However, in order to ship 32 packets of powder, Amazon put the 4 small boxes of 8 powder packets into a bigger box, surrounded the bigger box with plastic padding, and put that box inside an even bigger box!  As if they were worried the powder packets would break?!  See the attached picture.  We bought it ~4 times and same over-kill packaging every time.  Even if you're not concerned about the environmental impact, it was annoying to break down and dispose of that much packaging just for a few things of baby food.

review/summary: Pure deliciousness
review/text: For reasons known not even to me, I have purchased about 25 types of honey, made from the nectar of different flowers. Of those many types, this is my clear favorite for eating by the spoonful. It is very sweet, having only a mild flavor, and that flavor is delightful. Little or no aftertaste. I could joyfully eat far too much of this to be healthy.<br /> I have found that honey falls along a broad spectrum of flavors. There is the familiar, grocery-store flavor; clover honey and orange-blossom honey fit this description. They have a mild but distincly honey-like taste with just slight aftertaste--if you sampled an unknown type of honey and it happened to be one of these, it would seem familiar, plesant, and unremarkable. There are milder, sweeter honeys with somewhat less of the familiar honey taste and less aftertaste. Tupelo honey is one of these; starthistle honey is even milder, in my opinion, and differs somehow from the usual honey flavor in a way that I like. Then there are the progressively more strongly-flavored honeys. Avacado honey and manuka honey are these, with manuka being the stronger of the two, at least of the batches I've sampled, though there are probably differences to be had. They taste like honey, only with less sweetness, more aftertaste, and stronger flavor that still tastes like honey, though more like something that would be used as a baking flavor rather than eating by the spoonful. Eucalyptus honey (there are acually dozens of varieties of eucalyptus, of which I've tried only one generic variety so far) is also stronger in flavor, but different, with a bit of pleasant-but-medicinal aroma and aftertaste. The strongest honey I've found so far is buckwheat honey--it is dark like molasses, is as strongly flavored as molasses, and definitely fits the "tastes like a baking flavor" description (though I've heard it's wonderful mixed into pancake syrup, and I can believe it).<br /> There are a dozen or so honeys that are undistinguished, being a bit stronger perhaps than clover, but not so strong as manuka. For every honey that stands out as having its own flavor, there are many more that taste like a not-quite-perfect clover honey, i.e. palatable, perfectly acceptable, and perhaps a little different, but just slightly less appealing than the ubiquitous, generic clover honey.<br /> If you want a mild, sweet honey that is pleasantly different from anything else you've tried, this is it. I'll be buying more.

review/text: I used to be a super coffee snob - buying green coffee beans and roasting them at home.  It was tedious, but with a good espresso blend it would make one heck of a cup of joe.  Then due to the economy I needed to scale back, so I tried Folgers Black Silk after seeing an ad (this is when it was first launched).  I became immediately hooked and it is now the only coffee I drink when I brew at home.  If you use a French Press, you're in for a treat.  Black Silk excretes a delightful nutty oil when allowed to steep that those using filtered brewers will miss out on.  This coffee is strong, deep, dark, smooth, and delicious.

review/summary: Bold coffee flavor
review/text: While I enjoy coffee, I do not roast or even grind my own beans. Until recently, I didn't even make coffee; I just went to a local coffeehouse or Starbucks and bought what sounded good. Having decided that I would rather make coffee at home if I could find a decent approximation of the flavors I enjoyed while out and about, I started with lighter roasts. Needless to say, I was finding myself teribly disappointed by the weak results. I wanted coffee that tastes like COFFEE.<br /><br />When I decided to go for stronger flavors, I eventually settled on this one as my favorite. A dark roast, Black Silk has a strong flavor that goes great with milk and/or creamer. It does a good job of bringing the coffee flavor front and center in a pleasing way. It isn't easily pushed aside by other flavors and works well whether I feel like a more "straight" coffee, or something with all sorts of other elements. It isn't bitter or flat, and the aroma is heady and inviting as it brews.<br /><br />For a while there, I wasn't sure that anything I made at home could be both cost-effective AND as tasty as what the local barista could prepare for me. I am pleased to say that this is, and I find I have no interest in buying hot coffee as much when I have Black Silk on-hand. It's just great coffee at a great price that I can make at home in a matter of minutes.

I had no real expectations that it would be any good.<br />It was better than most commercial Mainstream coffee, but nothing to rave about.<br /><br />Then I decided to run this ground coffee through my Capresso Conical Burr Grinder (with it set to the finest grind), and lo and behold this coffee was transformed into a pretty damn good cup of coffee. I purchased a pack of 6 and it is the best commercial coffee I have ever used.<br /><br />While I prefer my Whole Bean Jet City, this coffee is far more than just acceptable.<br /><br />So, if your regular coffee is not available, try this one and Grind it on Fine and give it a try.  It will hold you over until your favorite is available and the price was not bad at all.

review/text: Like many coffee drinkers, I LOVE coffee and if you're reading this, you probably love good coffee too. I've tried all sorts of brands from the high end to the no names in search of a consistent, enjoyable and brutally strong cup each time. I like it potent and use 1 cup of grounds for a 12 cup pot...... no matter what brand I use. Of all of the brands I've tried, Black Silk is my absolute favorite as it comes out dark, oily and heavy but not too bitter. Keep in mind, I like a sweetened and creamed coffee, this will matter to some readers.<br /><br />For a real treat, pick up (or order from Amazon) the International Delights French Vanilla creamer (better if bought from the dairy section.) Pair these two together and you have a taste treat that's truly addictive.

review/summary: Best canned coffee I've ever tasted.
review/text: I work in an office full of coffee drinkers.  The other day, in a 16 hour double shift, we ran our 12 cup drip machine 10 times.  It's always a bit of an informal contest to see who can bring in the most exciting new grinds from our bean stashes.  The first time I brewed a pot of Black Silk one of the guys I worked with commented on how good it was and asked what it was.  In a very level voice I answered, "Foldiers."  The guy was absolutely horrified for a moment, thinking he'd lost his edge in the coffee tasting arena.  Then I told him what it was and that it was a new product and he went from horrified to merely pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />In short, this has become my go-to coffee when I run out of beans or don't want to run my noisy mill and wake everyone up in the morning!  It appears that the "Starbucks" craze has done to coffee what the micro-brew invasion has done to beer.  Would you ever have thought you'd see wheat beer that said Budweiser on the can?

review/summary: Black Silk! Believe it!
review/text: In an effort to save money, I bought this coffee on sale for $3.99 at the grocery store when I was unemployed. I grabbed the container as I drooled over the bags of Starbucks and gourmet varieties also present on the self. Once home I brewed a pot and to my surprise the aroma was incredible. Finally, I partook of a cup, and was surprised by how delicious it was! It is dark but not bitter. When I was a regular Starbuck's customer, I'd sometimes get a bad cup, with a bitter after taste. Not the case with this stuff. It's smooth. Keep in mind that you do have to add a little more coffee per each cup of water. For example if you usually put one heaping scoop per cup, put one and half per cup, or to suit your taste. Experiment with the measurements, but the coffee itself is quite good.

It's a little cheaper (if you compare price per ounce) than you could even get at Walmart with their large size can of the same coffee. The fact Amazon sells the small cans in a pack of six is an added bonus because the coffee stays fresh longer.

He told me how unbelievable it was on steak, and, boy, was he right!  I've used it on steak as a dipping sauce and I've barbequed with it.  I've used it on pork and chicken and have had it accidentally soak up into my side dish on my plate,such as rice and vegetables.  I don't care what you use it on, it's absolutely the most delicious concoction I've ever used on everything (although, I must admit, I haven't tried it on ice cream or cake! Just joking!)  I'm so hooked, I plan to buy a case of it.

review/summary: Just like the little cups, but neater
review/text: These wonderful fruits are of a consistency somewhere between apple sauce and baby food. I found this particular flavor to be exactly like the little cinnamon and applesauce cups that I often have at home.<br /><br />While these are more expensive (even in the store) than the little fruit cups, they have a perfect use ... Traveling!  As any parent with a child knows, kids, spoons, and  liquids are not a good mix. Spills happen!  Since these include only fruit, juice, and natural flavorings, they make a nice snack without added sugar.<br /><br />However, having recently made an extended trip by myself, I discovered they are wonderful in a different way. They make a great boost for the driver as well. And they aren't half bad, even when warm! I am a diabetic, so the 15 grams of carb are a perfect complement to my needs for a snack. I kept a couple next to me, and they were perfect when my blood sugar was dropping and the next rest stop was far away. My only problem using them this way involved getting the lids off!

review/summary: So YUMMY!
review/text: I first found these at our local "mart" store (you know which one) but they are often out of stock totally or only have one flavor.<br />This flavor, the apple cinnamon is good, but not my favorite. It's basically just applesauce with cinnamon like you can buy in the big jars, but this has no preservatives, colorings, additives, water dairy or gluten-nothing artificial...just apples and cinnamon, but the texture is much smoother than regular applesauce. It's not as smooth as baby food, but somewhere in the middle. It's extremely convenient for on the go, for kids *no spill and it has a cap!*, trips etc. They're a little spendy..in fact, more so here than at the local store, which is strange, but worth it to have the type you want, when you want it. I actually think my husband and I like it more than my 2nd grader! My personal favorite is the apple/strawberry flavor. I'm not a banana fan, so i haven't tried that flavor.<br />This brand also makes pure fruit bites, which are basically fruit snacks, but without added sugar, preservatives or anything but 100% fruit..and best of all in my opinion, NO GELATIN! They're very yummy, more so than sugary fruit snacks...they're a little tart which is nice. It's so great to have good snack food options, they're a great, fun way to get your daily fruits in. And, like the fruit pouches, they come in a resealable, ziplock type pouch which is also super convenient.<br /><br />All Natural<br />No preservatives<br />No added sugar<br />Soooo YUMMY!<br />..who could ask for anything more??

review/summary: Fun little snack; have video camera ready for first timers
review/text: A+ for concept, ingredients, flavor, fun, snack-worthiness. C for function.<br /><br />This product is a great little snack idea and is great to add fruit servings in to your kiddos day. It's a tad tart for my preference but both my 1 yr old and 4 yr old love these. They're these little plasticized foil pouches that have a sort of bottle-like nipple'ish mouthpiece - but free flow - that the kids can suck the product out while squeezing the pouch flat. The mouthpiece itself is under the twist-off cap and is about 1/3 of an inch diameter. They have a permanent home in my go-bag as they do not require refrigeration.<br /><br />BUT they do require a clean-up crew until your child figures out how to use em. WARNING: DO NOT USE FOR FIRST TIME IN A CAR. They're so cute and you're thinking "oh this is a perfect car snack!" But they're not until AFTER your child learns how hard they can squeeze em. My 4 yr old was coachable and likely could have been fine unsupervized in a carseat while I drive along. But my 1 yr old? Haha, she grabbed that thing up and WOOP! Up shoots a 3 inch geyser of applesauce-like-product. It was super cute and definitely a home-movie-moment but I'm glad we usually have wipes within reach. Unless you trust your kids to eat super neatly be cautious with this product: no dressy outfits, no papers, no artwork, nothing that can't be wiped down with a moist cloth. This apple cinnamon product in particular I'm not concerned about color stains, but it is sticky and... well, it's fruit.<br /><br />Once my girls got the hang of em it's been great. I even trust my 1 yr old in the car with em - but only when I'm not alone and another passenger can clean up possible 'geyser damage.'<br /><br />I bought this during a special and signed up for Subscribe & Save and the price was far better than in stores (Amazon was ~61% of my stores price). I'm definitely going to keep purchasing this product and try out other pure blended fruit flavors - I'm a little wary of the 'touch of milk' products that require no refrigeration.

review/text: I've never liked to eat fruit, and sure never liked applesauce.  But when my wife brought one of these home she offered it to me in front of our three year old, knowing full well I wouldn't refuse in front of our little mimic! I tried to steel myself to suck it down without grimacing so my daughter wouldn't decide she didn't like it either, but I knew I was going to hate it.  WOW, was I shocked!  This stuff is great!  No mess (the reason I don't like fruit), wonderful fresh sensation, smooth creamy texture and absolutely great taste.  I'm careful about preservatives and additives in our food, and Buddy Fruits pass my muster easily.  My daughter loves it and I'm now an addict.  It works especially great in the afternoon when my sugar drops and I start wearing out.  Beats energy drinks for a quick and lasting pick me up.  And being on subscribe and save makes it easier to handle the cost, which is cheaper than our local grocery stores.

I was impressed with the reputation of Whittingtons, but what is this stuff?  If I mixed coarse salt with dirt from my backyard, this would be it.  Maybe I just don't know black truffles, but someone should have washed them first!  I'm sending this back and will get truffle salt at my local gourmet store that I can smell first.

review/summary: Wonderful dog food, good price
review/text: This dog food was recommended by our standard poodle's breeder.  She feeds it to both her breeding dogs and her show dogs.  Our dog loves it, and eats every bit of his breakfast, lunch and dinner right down.<br /><br />The breeder said for us to mix the food with a little warm water and a tablespoon of plain, unflavored, nonfat yogurt.  My vet agreed, and said that the yogurt was an excellent addition.  He also has standard poodles as his personal pets.<br /><br />As poodle owners know, the breed can be susceptible to a horrible stomach condition called "bloat."  Feeding your poodle a top grade dog food on a regular schedule is very important for these lovely animals.  This dog food fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />It is interesting that this is an adult dog food, but the kibble is smallish, and if mixed with the warm water while the dog is a puppy, it can be used throughout the dog's life, once he/she is weaned.  You do not need a puppy chow when the dog is young.<br /><br />This seller provides this food at a fair price, and ships promptly.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/text: I am on a diet, but there are there are times when I like having a small snack.  A pack of Melba Toast doesn't cut it - just five small, dry crackers for around 100 calories.  The jerky is very tasty, not too chewy, not too sweet, and just the right amount of food.  It takes a lot longer to eat a packet of this jerky than a pack of Melba Toast, too.  So, I highly recommend this jerky for people who want something that is low-fat to nibble on.  The beauty of this is that you can also buy in bulk.  I don't think you save any real money doing this, as opposed to getting it retail, but it is very convenient to always have it on hand or just a "click" away!

review/summary: Love the 100 calorie packs
review/text: I love the 100 calorie packs. They limit my intake so I don't eat a huge bag. Bring them to lunch with me to get a good amount of protein. I like how they are smaller bite size pieces of jerky. It makes it easier to eat and not so gamey. They are delicious too! A little pricey though.

review/summary: jerky
review/text: pieces are small, not like a regular piece of jerky.  It had a good flavor though.  After purchasing them here, found them a lot cheaper at local warehouse store.

review/summary: a nice treat, especially with berries
review/text: I love Hunt's sugar free vanilla snack packs.  I frequently take a cup of raspberries or sliced strawberries and mix them with a pudding cup for a tasty, low calorie snack that keeps me satisfied between meals.  The cup itself is 60 calories and when paired with a cup of fruit you are looking at a 100-120 calorie snack. Each cup also has the equivalent of 10% of your daily calcium. It doesn't get much better than that.<br /><br />Eaten alone, the flavor of the no-sugar added cups is not as intense as the regular Hunt's pudding cups.  With my preferred way of eating the no sugar added cups, I don't even notice.<br /><br />I like that these are shelf stable and can be left in an office drawer when the need for a snack hits.  They are a good treat for those who enjoy pudding and don't mind a flavor that is a little less intense than the regular Hunt's pudding cups.<br /><br />It should be noted that most grocery stores carry the Hunt's snack packs for the equivalent of .25 a cup.

review/summary: How did this ever get to market?
review/text: These things taste so bad, I could not find anyone in my office who would finish one ON A BET!  They are absolutely foul.  I can't for the life of me figure out how any company would have put these on the market.  when you open them, they smell like pudding, which is a good thing except for when you actually taste them and then you feel like you've been tricked.  They have almost no taste, and the texture of melted plastic.  Another way to describe them is that it is like easting grease, except I think eating grease might be better.  And don't think the chocolate ones will be marginally better.  Snack Pack, shame on you.

review/summary: Keeps my pup occupied much longer than regular bully sticks!
review/text: These bully springs are excellent for dogs who tend to scarf things down quickly. My French bulldog (28 lbs) would chew half weay through a regular 6-inch bully stick and then basically swallow what was left. (This is why he never gets rawhides! At least bully sticks are 100% edible/digestible.) The spring shape, however, really forces him to SLOW DOWN. He works his way around each coil slowly. For me, this makes them worth the $$ just in terms of TIME he gets out of each one! He also absolutely adores the flavor--as with most bully sticks.

review/summary: Misleading ad. More like a quick snack.
review/text: I finally gave in and bought these expensive chews because the others we have used only last a few minutes. The package claims to provide "hours of entertainment" for your pet. What a ripoff! They didn't mention you would have to buy a case of these things and feed your dog a big meal of bull hide for it to last hours. I have a seventy-pound mixed breed dog, Roscoe, who is four years old. He doesn't chew for entertainment like a puppy would, but when it comes to eating, he is a real chewer. The kibble he eats is the size of puppy kibble and he thoroughly chews every bite. Well, I just gave Roscoe a bully spring and it was thoroughly chewed and eaten in under ten minutes. My seven month old puppy isn't quite as fast as him, but she too can put one away in minutes. The pig skin rolls at the supermarket last longer, and they aren't advertised and priced in a way that victimizes customers.

review/summary: Good and Healthy
review/text: I've been buying this company's cookies for many years.  They are tasty and don't seem "weird" although note that they have a rice-flour base, making them generally a tad crumblier and more delicate in flavor than cookies made with wheat flour.  They remind me of a light,  softer shortbread-type texture.  Personally I find this to be an appealing difference, adding some variety in choice (I'm not gluten intolerant but have a mild wheat allergy, so I can still eat some wheat cookies as well).  If you enjoy things like rice crackers, cream of rice, rice noodles and Asian dishes, you will probably like these and not find them strange.  In essence, I'd describe these as a lighter, more delicate version of a chocolate-chip cookie.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: These cookies are excellent in flavor and texture. They are the best wheat free, gluten free and non-dairy cookies I have tried. My son is on a very restrictive diet and is a picky eater. He just yums up these cookies. I often have to battle him to eat something else because he wants his cookies. These are the only cookies of this type he will eat. I don't know much about the other flavors but this flavor of cookie is tops.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that Amazon will not package them correctly. They will not cushion the bottom of the box and so a lot of cookies are broken upon arrival. I have E-Mailed a complaint but have not heard anything. Hopefully my next shipment will be packaged correctly.

review/summary: Heavenly
review/text: I've been sampling gluten free cookies, including Mi-Del and Enjoy Life. These are the clear winner. Nothing else comes close. These taste very "cookie like" and have that special something that is delicious. If I didn't know these were wheat free, dairy free I wouldn't have suspected anything.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: Taste is very good.  With any gluten free product, the texture is different. i feel the taste more than compensated for that.  Lots of choc chips and nuts.  Would definitely buy again.
