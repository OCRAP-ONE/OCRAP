review/summary: No. Just no.
review/text: This was a horrifying experience. I was really excited to see the noodles advertised on one of my favorite "deal" sites, and when the cost of noodles averaged out to about a dollar per package, including shipping, I decided to purchase them. I did some research on Wikipedia to make sure I wasn't secretly purchasing poison, but I should have done further research to understand what I was really buying.<br /><br />First off, these noodles smell like fish. Like nasty fish. They are packaged in water in what has got to be the most unappetizing presentation ever. The texture is disgusting and the noodles are this creepy, pure white. Do we have any Doctor Who fans here? Do you remember when the Tenth Doctor has opened up a Cyberman and those white cyber-innards come out? THAT IS WHAT THESE NOODLES ARE. SSeriously, Google "Doctor Cyberman innards" and the first picture is of The Doctor getting ready to embark on what he doesn't yet realize will be the most depressing meal of his life.<br /><br />You can't even call them noodles.<br /><br />I tried. I really did. I washed them (ugh) and boiled them and sprinkled seasonings and alfredo sauce and shrimp. The noodles still smelled like fish, but I pressed onwards. I ate about two bites and threw the noodles out, then I went and threw out all the other packages of noodles that I had just spent about $30 on. That is how nasty these things are.

review/text: I must admit that I am only a casual coffee drinker. However, I love nothing more than to relax with a nice cup of coffee after dinner. Kahve Koffee's Decaf Danish blend does the trick for me. Not only did this coffee win several awards in blind taste tests, but it is reasonably priced too! I strongly recommend this award-winning blend for all coffee drinkers. And for those of you, nay-sayers that turn their nose up to decaf coffee, just give it a try, I guarantee that you won't be able to taste the difference.

For anyone who may read this review, buy the smaller container of this stuff to give it a try if you are not 100% sure, and I bet that on your next order you buy the big container!

review/text: After spending 7 years in South Texas, you learn quickly what the good stuff is among the locals...and THIS is one of them! Years have passed and after moving to Tennessee, I was disappointed when I ran out of my well-stocked supply. I ended up back in South Texas a few years ago due to a funeral so I restocked, gladly! I recently, again, ran out and was thrilled to find the product on line! I've tried many brands throughout the years and NOTHING compares....TRUST ME! They also have a NO-Salt version...a Mesquite flavored fajita mix, and a Chicken Fajita version (I've tried it on the chicken, it's good but I still prefer the regular for chicken as well...just my preference). My mom, who moved from Texas 22 years ago, also keeps her kitchen stocked with this brand. There is just no comparison. Their website, to my great surprise, offers a ton of other products that are authentic and accessible....even some recipes. I'm known for my cooking and the love thereof... :) so, I quickly, and eagerly built a cart full of their other products to experiment with. Try this product, you WON'T be disappointed!

review/summary: "A chocolate malted milk in a candy bar" since 1923
review/text: In 1923 the Milky Way bar was created with the idea of putting "A chocolate malted milk in a candy bar".  The original Milky Way bar was created in both chocolate and vanilla flavors, even though the latter had a dark bittersweet chocolate coating.  The name was trademarked in 1925 and sold nationally the following year for 5 cents.  In 1932 the 5-cent bar was increased to a two-piece bar and then in 1936 it went back to being a one-piece bar and the vanilla Milky Way bar was changed to the Forever Yours bar.  If you were wondering why you do not remember the Forever Yours bar that was because it was discontinued in 1979, so I would strongly advise against eating any Forever Yours bars that you might happen to find.  However, in 1989 they came out with the Milky Way Dark bar, which basically had the same ingredients as the Forever Yours bar, but you should not eat any of those either because in 2000 the Milky Way Dark Bar was renamed the Milky Way Midnight bar, because the name change along was seen as a way of increasing sales, so those you can safely eat.  Outside of the United States if you want a Milky Way bar then you just gets a Mars bar.<br /><br />A Milky Way bar is made of chocolate malt-flavored nougat and caramel covered with milk chocolate.  The nougat part is made by whipping egg whites with other ingredients until light and frothy enough to make a frappe.  That is when the cocoa and malt flavorings are added to the frappe to create the candy bar's signature flavor.  As for the wiggly lines on the bottom of the bars, those come from the belt they ride on while cooling.  In 1999, in case you did not notice it, the Milky Way brand was reformulated and relaunched.  The year before they made over 200 million single size Milky Way bars produced in the United States, so they decided to change everything, from the packaging, slogan, and advertising ("Milk it!") to the taste.  The Milky Way bar saw a 20% increase in the caramel and the chocolate was made chunkier (however the Milky Way Dark bar that is now the Milky Way Midnight bar had its caramel increased by only 10%).  Today the slogan for Milky Way is "Pleasure you can't measure."<br /><br />The ingredients in a Milky Way bar are milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, skim milk, chocolate, lactose, milk fat, soy lecithin, artificial flavor), corn syrup, sugar, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, skim milk, less than 2% milk fat, cocoa powder processed with alkali, lactose, malted barley, wheat flour, salt, egg whites, artificial flavor.  Each Milky Way bar is 2.05 oz (58.12 g) and has 270 calories, of which 90 are calories from fat (which is not as bad as it sounds).  The product is gluten free but is only kosher certified in the Celebrations package.  The key thing here is the taste, which combines milk chocolate with creamy caramel and fluffy nougat into a pretty sweet tasting candy bar.

review/summary: My Favorite Candy Bar
review/text: While I enjoy chocolate, I'm not as in love with it as so many others seem to be.  My preference is caramel.  So when it comes time to pick a candy bar, I prefer ones that include caramel.<br /><br />That's why I got turned on to the Milky Way bar.  Each bar contains three layers.  The outside is milk chocolate.  Inside is mainly nougat, but it does contain creamy caramel.  That layer of caramel adds so much to the taste for me.  I love it.<br /><br />Naturally, it's a candy bar, so it isn't good for you.  A two once bar has 245 calories, for example.  Yet as an occasional treat, this one is tasty.

review/summary: Important Facts About This Product. Thank you.
review/text: Some of us should be warned about two important facts about this Annie's product:<br /><br />1. It is made from organic, white cheddar cheese.<br /><br />2. These are shells, not macaroni.<br /><br />Point number one is very important. Not just because the cheese is organic (organic pastuerized milk, salt, enzymes), although that is very important to some people. No, it is mentioned here because some purists will eat only YELLOW cheddar cheese. White cheddar cheese makes white cheddar cheese sauce, and together they make something to eat with the color of white cheddar cheese. Therefore, this will look white--not snow white--but a soft creamy white, and some people (who will not be mentioned here) insist on yellow. Often this is a bright, unrealistic looking yellow, almost like it's radioactive, but I am not one to judge.<br /><br />The second thing to know is that the noodle-like things covered with the white cheddar cheese sauce are NOT macaroni. (As in "stuck a feather in his hat and called it...") These are "shells." They resemble some sea shells, like the kind that Pagoo the hermit climbed into in that book, or like the rounded shells--only smaller--that you can put up to your ear and supposedly you can then hear almost anything, like even something happening in New York or France. Again, these are not macaroni, and this is important because there are some people who will eat only the little tubes known as macaroni.<br /><br />If you are OK with this, then you're in luck, and you don't need to look any further for a good lunch, dinner, or after play snack (or school, if you go to school). Annie's is like that other big company's product (Annie's is number two), where you boil and drain the macaroni (although here we have shells, NOT macaroni), and then mix in the dry sauce, maybe adding some milk or butter. "Season to taste."<br /><br />The actual, official, ingredients include the following:<br />Organic Durum Semolina Pasta (Organic Durum Semolina, Water), Organic White Cheddar Cheese (Organic Cultured Pasteurized Milk, Salt, Enzymes), Whey, Salt. These are all vegetarian.<br /><br />One more thing is that for information, games, links to "Arthur," and more about the company, visit www.annies.com. According to the website, Annie's is available in every state, and now has "a product line that has grown to include 13 different varieties of totally natural macaroni and cheese, Annie's now makes five tasty pasta meals, four yummy canned macs, and a microwave macaroni and cheese..." By the way, the name of the bunny on Annie's products is "Bernie." I learned that on the website.

review/summary: The Purple Box is so much better!
review/text: I was a kid raised on Kraft macaroni and cheese. The somewhat rubbery elbow noodles, the neon orange cheese.<br /><br />It was not my favorite...that was reserved for my friends families version. Grating up a whole bunch of mild cheddar cheese, and mixing it in with hot noodles off the stove.<br /><br />A couple years ago in the commisary I noticed that they had Annie's Brand Mac and Cheese. It looked more appetizing than the Kraft stuff my parents had, so I bought some. I haven't looked back since.<br /><br />Annie's Mac and Cheese comes in several varieties. You can look at them all on the Annie's Naturals website. The brand is oraganic. They get organic noodles, the cheese isn't full of fake preservatives and chemicals.<br /><br />Obviously, it's still mac and cheese we're talking about here, so it's not really GREAT for you to eat this all the time. However, this brand tastes so much better. It is admittedly a bit strange to eat white mac and cheese after being used to the neon orange for so long. But once you get over that, it's worth it. The shells hold the cheese sauce more nicely than the elbows do. Also, the cheese tastes fresher, more like real cheese does.<br /><br />It lends itself to mix ins, which is good for a change. Brocolli, small bits of carrots, peas if you like them... it's a good way to sneak some veggies into a picky childs diet. [I should know... I was that super picky child!]<br /><br />If you have a hard time missing the orange color, Annie's Naturals recently introduced a new version that has orange cheddar cheese mix. They use Anetto [it's an extract from a tree bark, I do believe. Look on thier website for the full information.] which is a natural colorant. It has that familar orange color, but tastes much much better!<br /><br />If you are looking for a better alternative to Kraft, I highly recommend this. The noodles cook up very nicely, the cheese is not gross, and you can reheat any leftovers the next day in a pan with a bit of milk which is nice.

review/summary: Good for cats - Loved by cats
review/text: Approximately 20 years ago, I began to exclusively feed our cats Iams or Science Diet.  Those brands were recommended by our Veterinarian after our first cat showed signs of Feline Urinary Syndrome (FUS).  I had previously fed the cats the typical brands such as 9 Lives, Purina and Friskies.<br /><br />I continued with IAMS and Science Diet, because the other brands caused FUS, caused other digestive problems and the good reputation of IAMS and Science Diet.<br /><br />Then last year, one of our cats developed bladder disease and died.<br /><br />Not long afterward, the pet food scandal broke. Cat and dog food from nearly every pet food company, including premium foods like IAMS and Science, were tainted by melamine.  More than 150 brands of cat and dog food were recalled.  IAMS and Science Diet were two of the recalled brands, as was natural sounding brands such as Nutro.<br /><br />I vowed to never again purchase pet food from the brands that had betrayed my trust.  I began searching for pet food that was all natural and organic.  Newman's Own is both natural and organic.  It was also one of the few brands not recalled. Although it was difficult to find a local source, I finally found a few, including Amazon.<br /><br />My cats love Newman's Own canned and dry food.  They also love Innova EVO.  I love it because I don't have to worry about tainted food poisoning my cats.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Peace of mind<br />2. Does not cause FUS, as did Purina and other similar brands<br />3. Much less likely to be tainted by lethal contaminants<br />4. The cats love it<br />5. Does not cause the other digestive problems.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It is more expensive than the non-premium brands<br />2. It can be difficult to find a nearby store that sells Newman's Own.<br /><br />Overall, the pros outweigh the cons.  And I can now add Amazon to my list of sources for the food.

I wish it were available nearby but I'm signing up for the auto ship which gives you free shipping and a lower price. My cats love the flavor and respond well to the nutrition and absence of processing in their food. I know how lethargic I feel when I get busy and eat too much processed food-why would they react any differently? It's well worth the money-I've tried cat chow naturals and while it is better than regular it does not produce the level of improvement that PN does so I'm sticking with the good stuff!

review/summary: My cat actually loves it......
review/text: ...and he hates everything. I fed my cat Iam's for years, because his vet reccomended it and therefore I figured it must be the best for him, but after the cat food scare, I wanted to get out of all the traditional brands. The vet reccomended another brand, which I cannot think of the name right now... that you can buy at PetSmart. It was pretty pricey - about $28 for a 64 oz bag. My cat hated it, he refused to eat it, and it looked wooden.But I took him to a playdate at a friends and he has this habit of eating out everyone's bowl and came across Newman's Own in his friend's food bowl. He loved it! My friend sent me home with enough to transition him and I ordered a bag instantly from Amazon. And if you are looking to go organic with your kitty, comparatively, the price for Newman's Own is right. Much cheaper than those in the same class.

review/summary: Great for cats with corn allergies--meat #1 ingredient
review/text: I have 2 cats.  One is fluffy and finicky and won't eat anything but wet food and human meat.  The other one is athletic, lively and will eat only dried "crap" food.<br /><br />Well, the athletic one started having terrible eye problems (red and weepy) and she constantly scratched at them.  We tried oral Lysine, Terramycin antibiotics, and swapping out the plastic dish for ceramic.  Still she had eye problems.  So, guessing it might be a food allergy, I bought her Newman's because it doesn't have corn gluten, the primary ingredient of almost all dry cat foods. Newman's #1 and #2 ingredients are MEAT.<br /><br />She ate it immediately. Within 2 days her eye problems disappeared, so I am assuming she had developed allergies to the corn product in the dry food (and by the way, what felines eat corn in the wild?).<br /><br />But what really amazed me is that fluffy and finicky passed over her usual wet food and went right for the dry Newman's.  I just about wet my knickers!<br /><br />There you have it, 5 stars.

I'll buy it when I can find an affordable price. (Five stars for ingredients and taste, one star docked for affordability.)

review/text: I purchased this food because I have 6 cats, and they were throwing up a lot.  I went from Purina, to Purina One to Whiskas to Iams and I knew there was something bad in the food.  After buying Newman's the throwing up stopped.  GOOD NEWS!  Except they don't like the food. I had 2 different flavors and they didn't like either one. I had a leftover bag of Iams and they broke into it.  I mixed it with Newmans and they picked it out.  I have now switched to California Natural and they don't throw up and they love the taste. I went to the natural pet store and got some free samples of different foods and my cats told me what they wanted.

review/summary: Good stuff, cat loves it.
review/text: I recently purchased the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FK60LM">Petmate Le Bistro Portion-Control Automatic Pet Feeder, 5-Pound Capacity, Black</a> automatic cat feeder and I have been looking for a good large bag of organic dry food to fill it with. After reading some reviews about Newman's Own Organic pet food, and spending a few minutes on their website checking out the ingredients I was confident the quality was high.<br /><br />The bag is a great size for the 10lb automatic feeder, fills about half the tub. I have one medium sized cat so this lasts for a couple of months. I placed the cat food on subscription, using amazon prime, so I got it for a great price as well.<br /><br />My cat seems to be enjoying it and eating her two potions a day. I'm never quite sure what people mean when they say their cat won't eat the food. Perhaps I'm a little more stern with my cat, if she doesn't eat it, she doesn't eat. Trust me, sooner or later they will learn to love it. I think this policy has meant she is pretty good at trying new food and enjoying it.<br /><br />As much as I can review cat food without eating it, I'd say this is a good buy. I checked out the price of some bags of organic cat food at my supermarket and its competitively priced.

review/summary: My cats seem to love it.
review/text: I've got two cats.  One is about 8 years old, grey shorthair domestic, and very calm by nature.  The other is about 4 years old, abyssinian, and a loud pain in the butt by nature.<br /><br />I've been feeding them the Nutro for fat cats, and they eat it up, but never all at once.  I decided against IAMS a long time ago because of their issues with animal cruelty while doing their nutrition/diet tests on animals.<br /><br />Today I decided to buy them Newman's Own Adult Cat.  I didn't give them too much since it's not a weight control formula (which, frankly, both my cats need).  They both practically inhaled this stuff.  Later on the abyssinian even went back to lick the dish some more.<br /><br />After they ate it they both instantly became very calm and went to sleep.<br /><br />I'll keep an eye on how much they keep on liking this food.  If all goes well, I'll keep buying it despite the slightly higher price.  (The price at Whole Foods was similar to the price here on Amazon... where can I get this for the other price people have seen?  That's like half the price... are you guys sure you're getting the same size bags?)  But it's Newman's Own and they give money to animal charities, so that takes some edge off the price.<br /><br />My only wish is they also made a weight control cat food as well.

review/summary: Switched to Newman's Own Organic and all 3 cats stopped vomiting
review/text: Our three cats throw up every day and have been doing this for years. I am not talking about hairballs but vomiting up undigested food. The vet says they are very healthy but "cats do this".<br /><br />Last week we switched from "Purina One" to "Newman's Own Organics Adult Formula Dry Cat Food" and low and behold the vomiting completely stopped -OVERNIGHT!<br /><br />Prior to "Purina One - Urinary Track Health Formula" we fed them "Prescription Diet c/d" with the same vomiting.<br /><br />One caveat -the chicken in this Newman's Organic dry cat food is "Natural" and not "Organic" so I contacted Newman's Own to ask them what they feed their "Natural" chickens. We received a quick response from L.Phillips Brown, DVM, confirmed that even though they are not Organic chickens, they do NOT feed these free-range chickens GMO grains.<br /><br />We recently learned that since the mid-90s, food companies have been slipping GMOs into human and animal food, without our knowledge or approval, even though studies say these are quite harmful (causing damage to internal organs). The Europeans are smart enough to ban GMOs but not us "dumb Americans". So unless it is organic you are best to avoid all non-Organic meat, poultry, and "farm raised" fish (they are all fed GMOs) and non-Organic corn, soy, cottonseed, Canola products (these are GMO).<br /><br />Perhaps this cat food stopped the vomiting issue because Newman's Own has no GMOs or perhaps it is because there are no grains. In either event, it works. And this is nothing short of a miracle! We are astonished that the change was so immediate.<br /><br />All three cats love this food. The cats have not vomited once since we switched. Also, the cats seem calmer and their food cravings - to have their bowls constantly filled - have gone away.<br /><br />We really lucked on to something here. What a great cat food!

review/summary: Better Than Prescription Food
review/text: I rescued two cats, and the female cat had urinary infections...she had to be put on a very expensive prescription cat food. When the manfacturer quit making the food, I had to search for another food, and every one of them gave her problems. I tried one prescription that made both her and the healthy male sick. I never even knew Paul Newman had cat food. Well, since I have put both cats on Paul's cat food, it has been wonderful. She is healthy now, and we aren't taking her to the vet frequently, as we were before. Our little male cat, Boots, has a shinier coat now too, which the vet noticed when he got his yearly shots. I highly recommend this food.<br /><br />Sadly, Paul and Joanne are now deceased. I admired them both. All of the money from their products went to charity. Yes, 100 per-cent. I don't know if things will continue the same when both Paul and Joanne were alive, but hopefully it will.

review/text: Wow, I was surprised to read the other reviews here.  After doing extensive research on this and other dry and wet foods, I found Newman's Organic to be one of the highest quality available.<br /><br />I was disturbed over the number of cancer deaths in both dogs and cats occurring each year.  The numbers keep going up and I figured it must be related to their diets.  This food uses human grade natural chicken (no hormones, antibiotics, pesticides) in both their canned and dry food.<br /><br />I wish this listing had the Nutrition Facts, but if you go to newmansownorganics dot com and read the FAQs you will learn a great deal about pet nutrition.  My cat loves this stuff and had no trouble with the transition from its old food.  She also loves the canned food.

review/text: Our 6 year old cat has been eating this food exclusively since we transitioned him from the Science Diet kitten food he was eating at the shelter before we got him.  We simply leave food out for him at all times, and this food makes up 99% of his diet (outside of a few bites of bacon here and there).  Once he reached adulthood, his weight has not varied more than a few ounces either way from a very healthy (for his overall size) 10lbs.  Our vet says that the long-term maintenance of a healthy weight is one of the surest signs of a good diet in adult cats.  He has a VERY healthy and shiny looking coat, is very energetic, and has very few gastrointestinal issues.  Plus, you get the added bonus of all the good the Newman's Own Foundation does.  Couldn't be happier!!

review/summary: Saved a lot of $$$ at the vet--be patient, though, it might take some time!
review/text: I bought this food based upon other reviews from people who said that it helped their cats who had been licking off their fur. For a long time our cat had been licking the fur off of her back legs. The vet said it was possibly an allergy and that we could spend all the money for allergy testing but might not find anything. She also said that we could consider giving the cat Benadryl to see if that helped (but didn't necessarily see the need to do either at that point).<br /><br />Eventually, though, the cat got to the point where she was pretty much licking off all of the fur she could reach--we literally had a half naked cat! She also had lots of small "scabs" (which she'd gotten before, but not to this extent), which was probably at least partly why she was licking the fur off. We figured the vet, if she saw the cat at that point, would recommend allergy testing. I decided to give this food a try first.<br /><br />I'm very happy to report that it worked! Some other reviewers said that it worked for their cats in a couple of weeks. With our cat it took at least 4-6 weeks. At this point she's grown all of her fur back and the scabs are gone, too.<br /><br />And she has loved the food from the very beginning--no problems eating it (as at least one reviewer mentioned), even though it is in very small pieces.<br /><br />So if your cat is licking off his or her fur, consider trying this before spending all of the money for allergy testing (unless, of course, your cat is having other medical issues, too, that you're worried about). Great stuff!

review/summary: Cats can't stand it
review/text: Of all the food I've tried on my cats in the last several years, this one is the only one they absolutely don't want to eat. Then when they do finally eat some, it tends to come back up again more than the others. Definitely a "don't buy". They really like Newman's Own canned food, though.

review/summary: 3 out of 5 liked it
review/text: The 2 cats that didn't like it are older and I think it is because the smaller round shape is harder to hold in their mouths to chew as a piece would drop out of their mouth and they wouldn't try to retrieve it. The other 3 eat it fine without hesitation. When it goes on sale again I will purchase it again. One improvement to the bag would be for it to self seal like so many other products are now doing.

review/summary: My cats wanted nothing to do with it
review/text: I have two cats - one of which will eat dry cat food. (The other has had some teeth issues and simply won't eat anything crunchy.) The one the does eat dry cat food though - who seemingly will eat any dry food wouldn't eat this one and I ended up donating it to a local cat rescue center hoping that it would at least feed some cat somewhere.<br /><br />I need to emphasize that my cat is not a fussy eater by anyone's standard and that she would not consume this says something about the product. So I guess it doesn't matter how healthy it may be if your animal won't consume it.

review/text: We were looking for an organic food after the melamine poisoning of pet food debacle.  Newman's Own dry foods for cats and dogs are manufactured in the US per their corporate veterinarian.  Newman's Own is up front about their ingredients.  For an organic food it is affordable.  Also it has been great at keeping skin issues under control.  Lastly Newman's Own is listed as a "More Responsible Pet Food Company".

review/text: I tried this in place of Iams.  My hefty maine coon won't touch it.  He is not a picky eater either (he was adopted at 5 and his previous family fed him some grocery store brands).  He eats around it and would rather sit at the pantry door meowing for new food then to go eat a full bowl of this.  The feral cats outside won't eat it either!  The only ones who seem to like it are the raccoons and possums and I try to not feed them.  We give this a two, two thumbs down.

review/summary: Kitty does not like it...
review/text: What a wonderful thought that Newman's Own makes cat food. Organic cat food. I would love to support this product and feed it to my big fluffy girl... she's really not a kitty anymore, and she's usually not picky with her dry food. However, she hates this food and literally turns her nose up at it. I've tried fooling her by mixing it in with her other dry food... since I had to go out and buy a bag of her old stuff, that is. She's good at leaving this stuff in the bowl and sorting out the food she likes. So I am about to toss this food in the garbage, and I hate to waste food. I wonder if there are too many veggies in this food? Cats and dogs are carnivores after all. Carrots and oats and peas are not really good for them. I'm at my computer right now, away from the ingredients list, but I recall this food is heavy on the veggie, non-meat ingredients. Sadly, I will not be buying this great-sounding product again. I think it would benefit from some steak juice at least... or some really stinky fish bi-product.

review/summary: Cats Won't Eat It.
review/text: Did the company that makes this product bother offering it to cats first to see if they would even eat it?  My cat won't eat it.  Pixie gives it two paws down. I tried offering it to the starving feral cats outside, and they won't eat it either.  I bought two bags of it for nothing.  My cat actually did try it once, and promptly threw up.  No fur balls came up any time after that, either, so I know she wasn't sick at the time.  She still refuses to eat any more of it.  It might be great from both nutritional analysis and organic points of view, but it's not any good if cats won't actually want to eat it.  I'm going back to Purina when I feed kibbles to the cat because I know from information that I've seen on TV that Purina actually taste-tests their products.  My same cat will eat the Newman's Own canned cat food with the same degree of enthusiasm that she eats Purina, but the same is not true for the kibble.

review/text: I am buying this product because my cat has health issues. While I lived in Indiana I was able to buy it at Walmart for around 11.00 for the same size bag. Since I have moved to the south there are no stores in this state that carry it so I had to pay a little over 20.00 per bag. This is really very over priced. You can bet when I go back to Indiana this fall I will be shipping several bags home so I don't have to pay this horrible price for a while.

review/text: I give it five stars based on the impression that this is a quality product, low in grains and high in ingredients more appropriate for carnivores.  Other than that, my cat ate it, but didn't love it.  He adores Purina One for sensitive stomachs (he was throwing up a lot and was very itchy so I tried Newman's thinking he may have an allergy).  He rarely throws up on the Purina.

If you would like a nice change (without something that you find keeping you up at night), and a tart but wonderful flavor and color, this is the tea.

Because it is caffein free, and I love my caffein,  and I love the taste of black tea, I make a half and half iced tea using this and plain orange pekoe and pekoe black tea.  And because I am from the midwest, I like my tea sweet.  NOne of this California unsweetened tea for me.  So I use Splenda of Equal to sweeten it.  Another great way to make this is as an iced tea using half raspberry and half Bigelow Lemon Lift tea.

review/summary: Great healthy raspberry drink, alternative to soda or juice
review/text: This is great raspberry herbal tea.  The bags are big so it makes a whole quart.<br /><br />The ingredients are just hibiscus, rose hips, apples, elderberries, natural and artificial rasberry flavors. (So who's going to be picky about a little artifical flavor - not me.)  Some herbal teas have other odd stuff like soy in them, so these are pretty basic flavorful ingredients.<br /><br />It has a very nice fruity taste, without the plant-like flavor you get in some herbal teas.  I  put a little bit of sugar in it and refrigerate.  Makes a great alternative to regular soda (which has high fructose corn syrup and other unhealthy stuff in it).<br /><br />Recently (2012) I found some boxes of this on clearance sale at two stores for just 99 cents a box, and bought them all.  I hope they are not discontinuing it.  Bigelow, if you read these reviews, PLEASE keep making this tea!

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: I recently purchased 12 bags of this gum.  It took several weeks to get here (backordered).  It is a wonderful product, but still unclear as to why you can no longer buy it in any stores (only online).  I paid over $50.00 for 12 bags of bubble gum for an uncle who loves it.  I'm sure I will purchase it again, but it seems that something this popular should be made available more places (especially for diabetics like my uncle).

review/text: Just the way I remembered it when I was a kid. I like having the sugar free rather than the sugar. Flavor does not last too long, however.

review/summary: What A Find!
review/text: When I saw this product I was elated.  With the desire to add more fiber to my diet and not being excited about some of the products on the market these seemed ideal.  Swallowing pills is unpleasant, mixing and drinking is not ideal to me and seems messy so the idea of just eating something in gummy form appealed to me right away.  These fiber gummies are WONDERFUL! I only wish every supplement I ever choose to take would or could come in this form.  No worries about chalky texture, bitter after taste if you don't swallow them right away and they begin to dissolve on your tongue and above all they aren't the horse pill size of some supplements on the market.  I will be purchasing this product from now on.

review/summary: Best fiber ever!
review/text: Fiber is good for you and I don't get enough of it in my typical diet.  The obvious solution is to take fiber supplements but I HATED those chalky, nasty things.  Then I found these!  Fiber gummies that actually taste good (even the no sugar added ones) and I actually enjoy eating.  When I first got them I actually ate too much fiber unintentionally because I suddenly didn't hate taking the supplements.  Plus, check this out, 2 tablets of the nasty, chalky ones generally have 4 grams of fiber.  But 2 tasty gummies have 5 grams.  These are awesome, if you need more fiber you can't possibly go wrong here.  One thing to note, their shelf life isn't fabulous and they start getting a bit too stiff and chewy if you keep them around 2-3 months or longer.  In other words, do buy them but don't stock up in bulk.

review/summary: Love me some fiber!
review/text: I purchased these for my son to help you with going to the bathroom and they have worked so wonderfully. They taste really good and I've actually started to take them as well and I really like the results. One thing to think about before you purchase this item on line in the heat of the summer is the shipping. I ordered this item a week or so ago and when I received it, all the gummies had melted inot a big lump, I assume due to the heat during shipping. These really need to be packaged in heat resistant package or temperature controled environemnt. I had to return the product and will probably be purchasing this at my local Costco instead.

review/summary: Taste great, good value, but give you the gas
review/text: The gummies taste really good but it gives me a lot of gas. Everytime I eat some, my stomach would growl and the gas would follow. Maybe it is the ingredient in the gummies?<br /><br />Oh and by the way, this item is heavy and the seller will most likely ship with parcel post. I would recommend grabbing some at Wal-Mart if you don't like waiting 2-4 weeks.

review/summary: Yummy Gummy
review/text: I purchased my first Bottle of Vitafusion Gummies (multi-vitamin) at my local supermarket.  I have since become hooked on Vitafusion!!!  I can't take a regular multivitamin in the morning or any other pill I must swallow.  For some reason they upset my stomach and I have been known to throw up all those precious vitamins. So, when I tried this and have no nausea, I was hooked!! Not only does it taste awesome, but they sell all kinds of different vitamins and Fiber!!! Believe me, once you go gummy, you never go back!!!  I have Fiber, Multivitamin, Calcium, Omega+ and B complex and LOVE them all!!! Thanks Vitafusion for answering my prayers!!!

review/summary: Awesome product
review/text: I was fortunate to buy this product when it was sold as a 3 pack (660 gummies) for the same price as the one bottle listed now. The gummies are awesome tasting which is a Vitafusion constant. I also take their gummy vitamins and they have the same great taste. My little boy and I have constipation issues and after taking these gummies for a couple of weeks now I can already tell a difference. I'm excited to find what I hope continues to be an easy fix for us. Thank you Vitafusion for another great product!

review/summary: Tasty Fiber in a gummy? You bet!
review/text: I'm a huge fan of Vitafusion products because they taste good and make taking vitamins really easy, if not, enjoyable--it's almost like eating candy without the guilt. The only draw back is potentially eating too much of it, so I would keep it away from children. Like other fiber products, eating excess can cause gas or upset stomach. There is also a regular version that is not sugar free, so if you are not too concerned about sugar, you have that option too. Personally the sugar free and regular versions taste pretty similar so no big deal either way. Overall, a good buy especially if you want to increase your fiber intake without the hassle or unappetizing of traditional powders, pills, and drinks.
