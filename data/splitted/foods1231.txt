My son had these last summer for the first time when he was at the Boy Scout Ranch, Philmont, in New Mexico.  He, of course, said this as a real treat while he was there.  I'm so glad I found them on Amazon!  Well worth the price...a great value!

review/summary: Best Thing On The Trail
review/text: I hate to just echo everyone else, but these things<br />really ARE that good. Like a lot of folks, I hadn't<br />heard of these before Backpacker Magazine<br />raved about them in April of '09.<br />I gave 'em a try and was blown away.<br /><br />Over the years I've found that I find food<br />--on long hikes--less and less appetizing...<br />especially when the temperature is over 90.<br />The thought of chewing and swallowing is<br />not appealing.<br /><br />Obviously SOME nourishment is still necessary,<br />but I came to dread PowerBars, and then next, the<br />tastier bars they spawned. So I switched to gels,<br />but after awhile, I came to dread those, as well.<br />But these little chews are delicious--I'll eat them<br />even when nothing else sounds good.<br />Between hikes, I keep them out of sight, because<br />otherwise I'd snack on them at home.<br />I'm on here now ordering another dozen for a big hike.

review/text: These are really good!!!  Also, be sure to try the Cherry Blossom flavor if you can - that one tastes absolutely wonderful!!  This doesn't stick to your teeth at all and it has a very pleasant taste and even smell to it.  One pack has just enough pieces.  Great to bring along when you're traveling.  I gave some to a 7yr old and she loved it!  Because it's not too sweet (none of that dreaded corn syrup in here), people of all ages would easily approve of this - I certainly do and would not hesitate to recommend this to everyone!

review/text: They have a great fruity flavor.  They are pretty sweet but you can taste the honey in them and the sweetness doesnt overpower the fruit flavor.  The texture is perfect, not too gummy like gummy bears that you have to chew forever but also not stick-to-your-teeth like sharkies. Kinda like gum drops and there's lots of them in a bag so you dont feel like you got cheated.  I think I like these more than any other sports chews I have tried.  They also dont leave your fingers sticky after handling them.  I hope they come out with new flavors.

review/summary: Great, but special?  I'm not so sure.
review/text: These Honey Stingers are great.  I've used them a handful of times on runs lasting over an hour.  They do seem to provide some much-needed energy.  They're easy to chew, taste great, don't stick in my teeth or make me extra thirsty, and the packet is small enough to be portable.  I really like that the ingredients are pronounceable and healthy enough (organic tapioca, cane sugar, fruit juice, etc.).<br /><br />However, I don't see how they're any different from organic fruit snacks (like Annie's bunnies), which I can get much cheaper in a multi-pack from my local wholesale club.  The ingredients and nutrition information are virtually identical.  For that reason, I gave them just 4 stars.

review/summary: Good substitute for candy but Sharkies are healthier
review/text: These are a good alternative to candy, but still a lot of sugar in a better form.<br />Sharkies energy sports chews are not quite so sweet BUT are Healthier becasue the man ingredient is brown rice syrup which is a complex carbohydrate with low glycemic index. Being very hypogylcemic brown rice syrup and agave nectar are the only two natural sweetners that don't cause a "sugar crash". So for this reason the stingers only get 3 stars and sharkies get 5! If you want sweeter in sharkies get the kids version, but they are like stingers- no brown rice syrup. Oh, the brown rice version fill me up faster because they are a complex carbohydrate and don't cause blood sugar fluctuations.

review/summary: Skip this if you don't want to Bonk!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Stinger products. However, these little gummy gels do nothing as compared to the Stinger Honey Packs. If you are a road or mountain biker and need a good burst of quick energy to keep from bonking on that last hill, these will not help. In fact, the only benefit that I (or any of my riding buddies) have found is that they make your mouth water. Conceivably, this could help with water consumption when riding through the desert (Moab, Fruita). It is my guess that these are not intended for exercising. Maybe, people just use them at work to keep from eating Starburst or something less healthy?!

review/summary: Great for Marathon Training
review/text: I'm training for my first marathon in November 2011 and these chews have kept me going during my long 18 to 20 mile training runs.  I dissolve them in water rather than carry them as chews and sip steadily after mile 8.  They taste like concentrated hawaiian punch and do not upset my stomach whatsoever.  I also eat them prior to a workout if I am feeling low energy and will even snack on them in lieu of candy.  Seriously, they are that good.  I have tried GU as well as Powerbar gels and both do the trick but are nowhere near as tasty.  The consistency of the chews are slightly softer than DOTs candy.

review/summary: Great tasting with help keeping energy up.
review/text: I was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running.  I am 60 years old and about 50 pounds overweight.  I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still, everything is organic which I suppose should add to it's value.  I found that I felt no energy boost during my activities but I can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going.  It's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going.  I don't like feeling like I'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that.  I think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising.  The only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them.  I will purchase again when my grocery money allows.  I would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy pickup to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost.

review/text: These are the most awesome little energy snack possible!  Brought a box of these on a hunt for a week with some buddies for the first time...along with a box of Sharkies. Prior to this, Sharkies where our mainstay when needing a boost and energy replacement.  Have to say, even the Sharkies fan in the group had to admit Honey Stingers fairly surpassed Sharkies in both taste and performance.  Will still probably bring both next time for variety, but definitely twice as many Honey Stingers.  Honey IS the perfect food!

review/summary: Smells like skunk-doesn't taste bad!
review/text: I don't quite know what to rate? The product was fine, the packaging was fine and there was nothing wrong with the fruit so I gave it 5 out of 5 since I don't think the taste should count in this instance. I ordered mine from ebay for much cheaper (totalling $7). The package arrived today. I had tried to get a whiff of the infamouse sewer-like smell from other Durian products I've ordered online. I tried Durian fruit chips off of ebay (HeyHah brand totalling around $3) and gleefully tore open the bag in hopes of getting a  knock-out decay smell only to not smell anything but fruit chips that didn't even taste that different from other fruit chips like banana. So I ordered this product in hopes that it would be different. It surely was, upon opening the bag I smelt a skunk scent that seemed to take over my eating space. Due to the smell I was being an avoidant procrastinator by putting it aside and focusing on something else until I built up enough of a hunger to try it. But then a chip fell out onto my desk and not wanting to toss it I bit into it spontaneously. The taste wasn't bad. It tasted like ordinary fruit with a musky background after swallowing. Don't eat this before a date. It is sort of like fruity garlic though not as strong as garlic and the taste surely doesn't last that long in your mouth. The fruit was sort of good with a somewhat creamy taste. Try it if you like to try new and different foods!

The smell is fine, I've never smelled fresh durian, but i assume it smells like this stuff just more potent, i like the smell of this stuff. The seller i buy from is Maxim eBusiness Technology, they can deliver from USA so i don't have to wait a month for delivery, I get free 2 day delivery with amazon prime which is great.

review/summary: Not too bad
review/text: If you have never tried Durian and are curious, these freeze dried pieces don't smell too bad -- not as bad as Durian jam -- but they don't taste good either. The texture of of Durian is one of the nice things about it, and it's lost when dried. These taste like dried dirty old gym socks.

review/text: I never thought I'd try this fruit, but thanks to this freeze dried option I got the chance and wow - a pleasant surprise! I was prepared for the worst after seeing so many people's reactions on TV. I happen to love the unique caramelized onion, sweet/savory flavor of this amazing 'king' fruit. I wish I had access to fresh durian so I could compare, but for now I'm satisfied with this. I just wish it were a little cheaper and easier to find.

Add to that the 08/10 sell buy date is fast approaching so the 2 unopened bag are in the freezer. Growing up the dried fruits were winter holiday treats a guess for a good reason.

review/summary: Herbmeal - Herb Seasoning Salt
review/text: This herb seasoning salt is very useful for anyone concerned about salt in your cooking. It is made of fresh and organically grown herbs infused into the sea salt. You'll use less than you would for table salt on your foods. The recipe is from the world famous Swiss Naturopath, Dr. A. Vogel. Herbmeal is completed under a special vacuum process at low temperature. So it is not only healthy but also very delicious. Give it a try and experince it yourself.

review/summary: Best seasoning salt
review/text: I don't add any purchased salad dressings. Being Greek I follow the greek style salad dressing: olive oil, lemon, salt and herbs in all my salads, not only in the greek salad. I was using fresh and/or dry herbs. And when I found this Herbamare salt I loved it. It has all of the herbs I was adding to my salad, but additional ones that taste great in salads.<br /><br />You can also add it to your rice, to your vegetables, to your meats, etc, etc. It gives a great, light, pleasant flavor to everything you add it on. It doesn't have an overwhelming taste.<br /><br />Everybody that tastes my salads loves them and asks me how I make them. I tell them the secret is the salad dressing. The simpler and most natural the better. I tell them about my Herbamare and now they are all buying it for their salads. And of course, I keep buying.<br /><br />The best part I like about this product: it is organic!!!!

review/summary: Best all-season salt, hands down... iffy spout!
review/text: This is the best all-seasoning salt. Only complaint: the rotating spout on top. It has three positions: pour, sift and closed. The two open setting are so close to the "closed" setting that I always have to take a few extra seconds to visually make sure all holes were covered up... kinda annoying. Even when they are, I don't feel like this "closed" setting it sealed tight enough to maintain freshness. Wish the lid "snapped" or "slid" closed instead like the smaller packaged versions of this product. Guess I could always transfer salt to another container. Otherwise, salt is highly recommended!

review/summary: Excellent Beef Jerky!! (I tried many - I love this!!)
review/text: Everyone has their own taste.  But I just got this bulk beef jerky sweet and spicy stuff and I love it.  I went on a crusade to find my favorite beef jerky and probably ordered and bought 15 different kinds, mainly looking for something beefy. spicy, and sweet.  This is by far the best.  It is savory, has that deep, beefy flavor, is sweet, and has the perfect amount of heat.  It is much more fresh and tender than other kinds I have ordered on amazon, some of which are as hard as a rock.  I would keep raving to you, but instead, I am going to go order more right now.  If this sounds like a sales pitch, sorry, (it's not) but I am so happy to have found such awesome beef jerky after months of searching.  There is another local ranch that makes some ok stuff, but they charge a lot more, and honestly I think this is better.  And, it comes right to my door!

It's not dry like other jerky - this one is kinda soft and bendy.  If you want some good hot & sweet jerky, definitely give this one a try!

review/text: I recently tried to find my food allergies by going on an "elimination diet" which initially means I could not eat any foods with any wheat, dairy, corn, refined sugar, etc.  This millet rice cereal got me through this initial period because it actually tasted good.  I would eat it with my rice milk and whatever fruit I was allowed to eat at the time.  I also liked it because it is crisp and does not get soggy too fast like some other cereals I tried.  The larger size of this bag was handy and less expensive than buying the smaller boxes.

review/summary: Cracklin' Oat Bran. Serious Business.
review/text: A long time ago, an organization called the Dutch East India Company controlled much of the global spice trade.  One of their most prized items of trade was Nutmeg.  It was so valuable in fact, that if one were to steal a nutmeg from a storage facility or even freshly plucked... the penalty was death.  Thanks to persevering horticulturists, nutmeg and other closely guarded spices were freed from their tropical island locations and found their way onto the tongues of those who weren't royalty or at least rubbed elbows with them.<br /><br />Why the heck do you care? Because the good folks at Kellogg's decided to liberally sprinkle the stuff all over Cracklin' Oat Bran after first adding brown sugar, cinnamon, coconut and vanilla.  Nutmeg is a traditional add-in for oatmeal with some cinnamon so it's easy to see why they gave it a shot.  The result however is a classic "greater than the sum of its parts."  The mix of ingredients is perfect.  Don't get thrown by the Bran right in the product name... YES there's 6g of fiber in every 2 ounces or so but there's also lots of sugar and palm oil.  While it's not technically health food, the balance does work.  The only way I could describe the taste would be an oatmeal cookie mixed with a nature valley granola bar mixed with a macaroon and sprinkled with magic... but better.<br /><br />I don't even bother to put milk on this.  It's the only cereal I eat dry but it's just too good to get all soggy.

review/text: I highly recommend trying this cereal. My mother served this to me for breakfast when I was a growing teenager involved in sports and kept me going through the day. Less artificial sweeteners than some of the other cereals out there.<br /><br />Amazon's subscribe and save program worked wonderfully. I ordered the cereal and two days later my large box of cereal arrived on my doorstep.

review/summary: one of the better cereals out there
review/text: This cereal has been a family favorite since it was first invented. Unfortunately it's a little more expensive than most cereals so that's why it merits 4 rather than 5 stars, but it's also much tastier than most cereals, and there's a lot of good fiber in it -- you can eat a smaller bowl of this and feel full.

I like the idea of nutmeg, cinammon, and coconut being mixed together. I was not disappointed. Another reviewer was correct about the cereal staying crunchy, even when put in milk. This cereal tastes like ginger snap cookies to me for some weird reason. Abd it's healthy! Highly recommended!

review/text: Ok, so maybe a warning is a bit strong.  I haven't eaten Cracklin' Oat Bran in at least 25-30 years, but I still remember that fateful day that I first tried it.  I popped a couple of crunchy pieces in my mouth and proceeded masticating.  After a few chews, I knew something was awry.  I detected the unexpected and undesired texture of coconut. I checked the label...sure enough coconut was right there.  For you COB lovers, rest assured that the formula has not changed in the past quarter-decade.  For those of you, like me, you detest the texture and flavor of coconut, you are forewarned.

According to Cento, they stopped paying extra to get the DOP label, but those with the new "certified" label are the same tomatoes grown in the same region of Italy as the cans with the old "DOP" label. It would appear the different labels make the product taste different to some.

review/summary: Good quality cat food
review/text: We feed this food to our almost grown kitten. He loves it.  Since cats are carnivores, this food fits the bill as it is mostly JUST fish, not fillers like corn and grains that really are not good for cats.<br />I really didn't like feeding the cat canned food because it grosses me out.  This food smells just a little fishy but is really not bad at all - compared to some cat foods which smell disgusting.  It's also very convenient and not messy.  You don't need to use a spoon to get it out of the pack.  Just rip it open and squeeze it out.

review/summary: Cats love the food (Hooray!) I hate packaging
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/summary: Slop.
review/text: Maybe my cat is spoiled. We've fed her "Soulistic" brand pouches since the day we brought her home. I saw this product when I last shopped for her food. It looked like a real gourmet scene, so lovely was the image of the food on the packaging. Now, I know there's always a disparity between the box image and the actual fare, but this has to be the most glaring, bald-faced LIE in the history of marketing.<br /><br />When I opened the package (which showed a expiration date well into 2012), I felt confused! Almost like I wasn't sure if my eyes weren't playing tricks on me! The entire brown, gelatinous mess slid out like a giant leech into her bowl. After some desperate prep work, mashing things up, I managed to get this glop to a state where it more resembled something that you'd see sliding down the wall in a monkey's cage.<br /><br />My cat took one sniff, and regarded me with a glance that can only be described as a "how dare you", and strutted away. Hungry, but with dignity in tact.<br /><br />I WILL get a refund for this gunk. Mark my words.

review/summary: The cats love the food, I hate the package (cats win!)
review/text: I have four cranky senior cats who never seem to enjoy the same food (picture an older, more crotchety male cast of the golden girls). One likes fish, the other eats it and throws up bright pink everywhere; one was open to trying a raw diet, the others wanted to eat canned food - though usually just the juice or gravy. Anyone who has cats knows that they will starve rather than eat something they don't like - just to prove their point. Because one of my cats is diabetic, I've been trying to keep them on a grain free diet, only, they don't seem to enjoy any of the fancy grain free canned food from the local yuppie pet store.<br /><br />I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef).

review/summary: Finally a food my finicky feline will finish!
review/text: My cat is 15 years old, and has NEVER liked a kitty treat in her life - the only non-dry cat food she would ever eat was REAL tuna fish juice, drained from the can (and never mind the tuna). She has also had what I affectionately call a "tender tummy", meaning that every few weeks, since she was a kitten, she has had vomiting episodes that last a day or so and then disappear again. No explanation. Basically, I've just had to find cat food for her that matches the carpet on the way back up. Ew.<br /><br />About a year ago, she stopped eating all together, and I was worried that she and I had reached the end of her long life. In actuality, she had just decided she no longer liked the IAMS senior she had eaten for 10 years, was going on a hunger strike that put her in the ER Vet with failing kidneys due to dehydration.<br /><br />Enter Wiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna (in the pack of ten, with the sardines and Whitefish/tuna mix). She instantly started eating again, and her health returned in a matter of days. AND, no more random vomiting!! She even deigns to eat dry cat food once a day to supplement the moist stuff - I'm using IAMS young adult (orange bag), and have had no problems there either.<br /><br />She has her preferences with the Wiskas, don't be deceived. She will ONLY eat the purrfectly fish, NOT any other flavor, and really doesn't prefer the sardines (neither do I). The tuna entree with the whitefish is often only halfway eaten, but the tuna entree alone is always finished, which is why I was so happy to see it for sale here by itself.<br /><br />One complaint, though. My kitchen now smells like dead fish. But, to save my carpets, her health, and my sanity, I'll sacrifice a little smell.

review/summary: Whiskas Won
review/text: My cat has developed an increased appetite since I changed her diet from ONLY dry food to moist food.  She is 17 years old and has lost so many teeth that dry food was becoming too difficult for her to eat.  After two years of serving her "wet food" I never made a distinction among the different brands of wet food until recently.  I always buy different brands of wet food, and she seems to enjoy the ones from a packet rather than a can.  However today, with WHISKAS, after devouring a whole packet,  she wanted another one.  Not only that, but she licked the plate entirely clean.  She kept begging for more and I finally gave in to her wishes. I was very surprised when I just went to look at her plate because she consumed an entire second package.  I better check this out with her vet.  She is not overweight, but I don't want to overfeed her.

review/summary: My cats love it!
review/text: My cats are 10 years old, and have eaten dry food their entire life. I would give them wet pouches once in a great while as a treat. However, about 6 months ago, the female started puking on a daily basis, and let's just say it was not a "normal" type. I tried different brands (they had been eating Cat Chow Indoor Formula), but she is no longer interested in dry food (the male will still eat it). So I started buying Friskies pouches, and they seemed to really like it, but I noticed that little by little, they started leaving more and more food. They would only lick the gravy and leave the food.<br />Finally I tried this Whiskas item, and they seem to really love it, and they eat every bite. I'm glad I finally found something she will eat, because she has visibly lost weight.<br /><br />Oh, and Amazon's price is more expensive than a grocery store, but unlike some other people who misuse these ratings, I am rating the PRODUCT, not Amazon. The 5 star rating is for the cat food alone.<br />I'll go to a message board if I want to discuss Amazon's business practices.
