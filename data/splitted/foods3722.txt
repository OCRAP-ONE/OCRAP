review/summary: Better than Bob's Mills- lots of flavor
review/text: We cook with coconut and nut flours often. This has a much better flavor than bob's mill.  This brand has a fresh coconut taste whereas Bob's is much more bland and doens't taste that much like coconut. To make this brand more into flour, we just put it in the food processor for a few minutes and it is well worth the extra work for the flavor.

review/summary: Disappointed!
review/text: As someone who has lived in the Caribbean and is therefore very familiar with coconuts in all forms, I am very disappointed with this product.  The coconut is dry, stale and lacking in flavor.  None of the mildly sweet, deliciously unique flavor of dried coconut is present here. Save your money and look elsewhere for a superior product.

review/text: It is great to have exactly what you need to cook with on hand without running to the grocery store constantly which is why I love "Subscribe and Save". This coconut is something that I purchased a small bag of, for a rather high price, locally a few years ago and knew that it worked well in most of what I use it for. It does not overpower other flavors like a lot of other cheaper coconut. It has a very mild flavor that doesn't taste fake like cheap coconut does either. Make sure to refrigerate after opening to keep fresh too. Great product!

review/text: First, this isn't your sweetened, find it everywhere else coconut!  It's an organic, finely shaved, unsweetened coconut with a dry texture.  I've used it for making coconut butter and it's awesome!  It set up in just a few minutes using a blender and it had a great taste!  I also use it for smoothies - no added sugar and all the benefits of coconut!  But, don't buy this if you are looking for a grocery store look a like...it's not the coconut you are used to seeing!!

review/text: Unfortunately, this product is not described accurately in its labeling.  The consistency is fine, more grated.  The problem is small coconut fibers tend to stick to the roof of one's mouth...creating a undesirable after effect. I'm not sure what I can make with these 12 bags of coconut now.

I made cookies since getting it and love that the coconu blends in so well and is not chunky like others I have used before.  The Price on Amazon is cheap compared to the bulk section in my health food store.  Which surprised me, I did the math several times before buying.  Like another reviewer states, this is not a medium shred, it is very  very fine.

review/summary: Going Coconuts!
review/text: I love this product. Searching for unsweetened coconut was a hard chore. So many of them are sweetened and I didn't want that. I have used it in baking, making coconut milk, coconut cream and coconut flour. The bags are the perfect size for my use as they are smaller and I don't have to open one and let it sit in my freezer forever getting stale. The tastes is all coconut and I like the smaller pieces because it makes the milk easier to blend and my resulting four much more fine. And I looked everywhere and this price can't be beat.

review/text: What would you like to know about salt? You can most likly learn all (...)On the morton [site] you can read up on all the different uses for salt, for cleaning, your feet, your throat and so on. Beyond that, I will add my opinion. Morton was a well trusted product long before I was born. When I was a kid they use to really promote the anti clumping agent in the salt, so it poured when it rained. From what little I know about geology, salt has in some cases been around for millions of years. But mineral deposits in some area are more pure then in other area. We know we can trust Morton to give us the cleanest, purest product available. Even when the company is bought and sold, they still seem to maintain their high standard of excellance. Everyone needs salt, but we should also be careful not to over due our salt intake.

review/text: 5***** for GOITER PREVENTION! 5***** for VALUE!<br /><br />"Morton Iodized Salt" is a lot like Coca-Cola, it is available everywhere and you can be sure of what you are getting. Morton makes salt into their reason for being, so we can be pretty sure that they get it right. Every container of "Morton's Iodized Salt" that I have used over the past 50 years was exactly like every other which is the kind of consistency that makes a consumer feel safe. If you want to avoid Goiter, this is the ticket. But it must be taken in very small doses and only when it must be added to something you are cooking.<br /><br />At Morton's very informative website which will not copy here but it goes by there name, there are links to useful nutritional websites such as "THE SALT INSTITUTE". I know what you are thinking, but it does have wonderful color slides of human anatomy showing how much salt is in our body and what it does. Essentially, salt is an essential mineral that is over-consumed in processed foods. However, if you don't eat processed foods, you will need salt and iodine to be added to what you eat, especially if you exercise daily or if you live in a desert or other hot place.<br /><br />This is a product that my family buys once every 3 years, so how could we ever consider saving a dime with a store brand when we have 50 years of satisfied experience with Morton's Iodized Salt? I love the little girl on the packaging also. She hasn't changed much since 1914 and not at all since 1968. Some things can't be improved, just like Morton's Iodized Salt.<br /><br />NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY COMPANY OR PRODUCT

I add some plain tea leaves to the pot and I've got a delicious spicy chai, just the way I like it.  There's nothing better on a chilly evening than a warm cup of chai properly sweetened with raw cane sugar... and don't forget to add some fresh cream.  Mmmmmm!

review/text: I hunted long and hard for a Chai tea that I enjoyed and there were several that I found of high quality -- this was one of them.  I drink a pot of this Chai every morning and it is one of the highlights of my day.  But most impressive for me (seeing as I do drink a pot a day) is that I am not paying an exorbitant price for the honor of so tasty a beverage.  Thank you Amazon for bringing this to me, so that I don't have to pay for an over-the-top mall store-front with overpriced EVERYTHING, and I don't have to pay for layers of mental canisters that will only add to our recycling costs unnecessarily.  Zhena's puts this phenomenal tea -- and a lot of it -- in a sensible, air-tight, zip-lock, bag.  So I am paying for what I truly value -- TEA!  I read some reviews that complained of too strong a pepper flavor -- I must admit that sometimes a cup does taste a bit "peppery."  But I enjoy that flavor, and it mingles well with all the other earthy and dark spices, so I believe that ultimately it is a very satisfying taste.  Great with a little sweetening and milk.  Great with gingersnaps, carrot cake, or a cinnamon roll!

review/summary: It's good but not enough flavor for me.
review/text: I've been a big fan of their Coconut Chai for a long time, then I wanted to try something new, so I got this one.  I saw in the reviews that this was too spicy for some people and wanted to try it because I like my Chai flavorful and a little spicy.  I don't think it's spicy enough.  I think I like their Coconut Chai better, it has better flavor.  I'm going to try their Fireside Chai next time though since that seems to be the real spicy one.

review/text: I am a big fan of Rockstar for long drives, late nights, and it works miracles on headaches.  The 16 ounces is a lot and i feel it is almost overkill for me.  I would describe the taste of the traditional flavor as liquid Smarties it has an after-bite when you swallow.  I also feel it's not necessarily the healthiest thing to pump myself full of that much caffeine because i feel the drop off of the large dose and i often get upset lower-intestine tract the day after.

review/summary: Yes, I love Rockstar
review/text: I was surprised that many thought this was different then the "regular" Rockstar. Double strength refers to the size of the can, not the ingredients. Rockstar definitely tastes best when as icy cold as you can get it. I like to compare it to champagne, most of your really expensive champagne's taste exactly like Rockstar, except they have the opposite results. Which is why you should never combine the two, can't believe people are crazy enough to combine an energy drink with alcohol, not smart.<br /><br />Normally I would not order this from Amazon because I can get it for a lot less locally, but Amazon was running an "Amazoning" special that worked out to $1.00 per can, woo hoo, way to go.<br /><br />PS: it is one of the few ways to get your Vitamin B's that isn't nauseating. From one who gets sick at just the smell of Vitamin B's.

review/text: It's hard to overstate the benefits of oat bran. It's delicious, filling, high in soluble fiber, lowers cholesterol, etc., etc.  I've used lots of brands of oat bran over the years and find this one especially good. It is a little coarser ground than I am used to and thus needs to be simmered for a few minutes. For this little extra effort (I've had oat bran that I could just microwave) you get a great nutty flavor and chewy texture. I cook it with milk and add a little virgin coconut oil and cinnamon--fabulous and super filling!

review/text: Hodgson Mill Oat Bran is a staple in my house hold.  I follow a body building/fitness lifestyle, and this is something I have for breakfast every day.  This stuff swells up and makes a huge protion, without packing on additional calories.<br /> I normally cook it in the microwave in a large bowl at 80% power for 6 minutes.  40 grams oat bran, and 1 1/2 cups water.. not all water added at once, but 1/2 a cup of water at time. Stirring it every minute or so. Make sure you keep an eye on it because it can over flow easily.. Let it sit for about 15 minutes after cooking.  I then add 1 scoop of Chocolate protein powder to it.  It makes it taste like Chocolate Malt O Meal.  So good for a pre workout meal or post workout meal.<br />I subscribed for autoship on this product here on Amazon.. SO excited as I can only get this a one certain grocery store here in town, and normally they are out of it.<br />One thing I noticed is that the calories on the packate dont quite add up.  It adds up to 3 calories per gram on the box, but, in reality its 3.32 calories per gram. I find that a lot of products information like this dont quite add up, so I always double check.. no biggie.

review/text: The Green Mountain Cafe Escapes chocolate is my current favorite among the chocolate flavored coffees and cocoa available for the Keurig coffee makers.  Note that this product is "dark chocolate" cocoa, not chocolate flavored coffee or "milk chocolate" cocoa.  It has a more intense chocolate flavor than the milk chocolate version.  Sometimes I like to add to the rich chocolate flavor by adding 1 tablespoon of Coffee Mate Sugar Free Hazelnut non-dairy coffee creamer. For calorie counters that's about 90 calories for the cocoa and the creamer.  An occaisional dash of cinnamon is also very good.  Delicious and very easy to make.

I am a huge dark "drinking chocolate" fan but this didn't taste natural to me. I've kind of learned my lesson to stay away from K-cup beverages that are sweet by nature because I don't care for artificial sweeteners and at this point, that's what most of them use. It's not the worse I've tasted, though.

review/text: The product contains suralose. This may be a bonus to some, but for us, it's a deal breaker. We can not stand the taste of artificial sweeteners, and both my husband and I agree the aftertaste in this beverage is too much to tolerate. I would have preferred if the product would have highlighted this fact before I purchased it at a local supermarket.(Which I had decided to try some of the k-cup products there before purchasing large batches from Amazon.)<br /><br />If you like the taste of sweeteners like suralose, this product may be for you. It is not too watery when made on the 7.25 oz portion size, and is an acceptable instant hot chocolate otherwise.<br /><br />I just wish there was a k-cup hot chocolate not made with an artificial sweetener, even if it had to be unsweetened or add your own sugar. I have yet to find any hot chocolate product like that, and it appears all Cafe Escape products contain suralose.

review/summary: Great for my allergic dog!
review/text: We adopted a dog from the humane society and had tried about 6 different high quality dog foods before we tried this one, this is the first one that we really noticed a big difference! Her coat came back and her itching has reduced noticeably. She's gaining weight and loving it, as is our other (non-allergic) dog. So glad we tried this dog food, I know it won't work for every dog's allergies as everyone's are different, but this one is definitely worth trying!

review/summary: Dog with Allergies, Sensitive Stomach
review/text: I have been feeding Nature's Variety Instinct, turkey and duck, to my German Shepherd for almost a year now. He has suffered with allergies (both food and environmental), and has a very sensitive stomach. I am very happy with Nature's Variety, and my guy does great on it. I recommend it to anyone who has struggled with finding a food for a dog with allergies. I also appreciate Amazon selling it with a repeat delivery service. It is really nice not having to go out and buy it every month!

review/text: i have been buying dog food, for id say probably 20 years. and for the most part i didnt know the full extent of the crap i was feeding my dog. i used to buy anything id find at the local grocery store. turns out the stuff is bad for them. i believe the vet bills confirmed this. since i made the switch to instinct my beagles have been doing much better. one is just turning 15 and has basically turned back the clock. when it comes to dog food you really do get what you pay for.

review/summary: Finally, no more soft stools and scratching!
review/text: My nine year-old labracollie has a very sensitive tummy and is allergic to a lot of foods.  I started my labracollie on Instinct Grain-Free Duck/Turkey about two months ago, when I ran out of her usual dog food (which was working out "okay") and had to give her our wiener dog's food.  I immediately noticed how pungent this dog food was.  It smelled very concentrated but I ensured myself it was not bad by checking the kibble and expiration date.  The smell may shock some people, but after that initial surprise, I noticed how eager my dog looked when she got a whiff of this food.  I think some dogs like stinky-smelling food.  She started eating it right away, and the very next day I was happy to see that she passed a normal stool!  It was even great that she was not scratching like she a maddog.<br /><br />It's only been two months so I can't comment on how she does long-term.  I will probably update this review if I find notice anything that I feel could be shared.  My dog is about 52 pounds and I go through the 13-pound bag in about two weeks.  The results, so far, definitely validate the additional cost; and I feel this brand is decently priced compared to other grain-free dog foods out there.  So far she has tried the Turkey/Duck and Beef/Lamb and she liked both of them, and is still passing normal stool.  Unfortunately she's allergic to chicken so I can't give her the Chicken mix and she has never particularly cared for fish so I am debating if I should bother with the Salmon Meal.  My next bag will probably be the Instinct Grain-Free Limited Ingredients, just to give it a try.<br /><br />So to recap...<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good for dogs with sensitive tummies and food allergies<br />2. Kibbles are small.<br />3. Reasonable price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Smells strong.

review/summary: My dog likes it
review/text: My dog doesn't really eat much (strange for a corgi) and I just leave food out for him to eat whenever he wants. He usually eats a cup or so a day. With some brands (I only buy the higher end dog food for him), like taste of the wild, he seem to only eat when he was starving. This brand must taste better to him since He eats more frequently. He's energetic and his fur looks fine so no complaints (besides the higher price tag of $65/25.3 lb).

review/summary: Best of the pumpkin kcups
review/text: This kcup was pretty tasty once you get past the weird smell while brewing.  It was described as a bit "funky" by some coworkers.  I tried it out anyway and was impressed.  It's very smooth and has a nice pumpkin flavor.  It gets better as it cools.  The clove flavor is only slighty noticeable which is a very good thing.  The flavor was pretty close to pumpkin pie.  This would mix really well with a good french vanilla kcup and some cinnamon.  The flavor is light years better than the Green Mountain pumpkin spice kcup. It took me a year to get through that box.  I threw out the last few.

review/summary: Idahoan REAL Premium Mashed Potatoes - 3.24lbs
review/text: Okay, Okay, I can see your eyes rolling. Instant mashed potatoes?  Well, not everyone has the luxury of having the time (or skill believe it or not)to properly prepare mashed potatoes.  There are many things that are going on in our lives and having to make a side dish that takes more time and/or effort to prepare than your main course on a weekday evening just ain't gonna cut it.  The nasty instant (dehydrated) potato?, blasphemy you say!<br /><br />Well, I may not be totally crazy (although the jury is still is still out on this one) but there is at least one (the only one that I know of) that is pretty damn good and it is the Idahoan REAL Premium Mashed Potatoes that I used to buy at Costco long ago in 3.24lbs containers.  For what ever reason, Costco stopped carrying this product but may still may carry some of the Idahoan potato product line.<br /><br />In short, they taste pretty  darn good by themselves but I have been known to add in some sour cream in lieu of some of the milk, blend in some well-cooked cauliflower, cheese or even some bacon bits.  Just follow the directions.  It is that easy.  Also, instant mashed potatoes can also make a good gravy thickener if used in small quantities.<br /><br />I just ordered some from Amazon.com for $14.337 a box.  Remember, this box weighs more than 3 pounds and will last a long time and price per ounce you can't beat...and as a matter of fact, you can't even mash it.  lol<br /><br />I usually order more to get the Super Saver shipping discount.

review/summary: AWESOME mashed potatoes -- from a Box?  YES!!!!
review/text: OK, so if you're actually serving mashed potatoes from a box (erghhh...), you wouldn't want to TELL anyone, right?  WRONG!!  These are so good, it's worth bragging about them.  I was serving dinner for 12 from my open kitchen, a little behind on the cooking, and thus everyone saw (and gasped!) when I mixed the mashed potatoes just before serving.  My husband and I are generally considered a team of good cooks, and people were already wolfing down appetizers in preparation for what they fully expected would be an outstanding meal -- and here I was making mashed potatoes FROM A BOX??<br /><br />Well, several stuffy guests put token amounts of mashed potatoes on their plates and just moved them around on the plate, leaving them there when plates were cleared.  No one else said anything -- except that everyone else had seconds or even thirds on the potatoes, and *three* wives contacted me afterwards to find out where to buy the exact same box!!  Confession:  I'd have made the potatoes in advance and hidden the box if I'd had time.  Alas, I didn't.  Now, I wouldn't even bother trying to hide.  These potatoes are THAT good!!  We still have remnants in a box that's a year old (don't have mashed potatoes for dinner parties all that often, and use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOUK7E">Idahoan Mashed Potatoes, Four Cheese, 4-Ounce Package (Pack of 12)</a> in a smaller and even more convenient package for family use) -- and the potatoes from our old box were still GREAT last weekend!<br /><br />If you're a mashed potato lover, or if you cook for those who are, you owe it to yourself to try these.  I make great mashed potatoes from scratch, but these are just as good and take a whole lot less time (best part is not having to peel all those potatoes!).  This product is a huge win!!!

review/summary: Cheap & Cheerful
review/text: This is a great staple to have on hand when you need a quick bite. I never really measure the potatoes, just sprinkle and stir the dried potatoes into a bowl or pan of boiling water until they are just slightly wetter than I want. The potatoes will absorb a little more water as they sit. I then add salt, pepper, and sometimes butter and milk. If I have no milk on hand, I sprinkle in a bit of nondairy creamer. Doesn't sound great, but it tastes fine. Sometimes I sprinkle on a layer of shredded cheese and allow it to melt and then stir it into the potatoes - yummy! I also save the packets of garlic butter dipping sauce that a major pizza company includes with their delivery pizzas. I've found that they are a great flavoring for these mashed potatoes. I just open the packet and pour the liquid into the potatoes and stir. They taste like the much more expensive boxed garlic butter mashed potatoes at a fraction of the cost.

review/summary: Delicious alternative to other healthful herbals
review/text: If you are seeking a stupendous alternative to the same ol' herbal teas, look no further.  My wife and I were graciously given samples of this (and many other) teas when we stumbled on the Stash Tea Company's headquarters in Portland, Oregon.  True to its name this tea has a light honey-sweet floral flavor that nicely tolerates a little added cream, though it is fine without as well.  While my wife and I have slightly different tastes in teas, we both agreed we should stock this as a regular tea.<br /><br />Similar to red tea, honeybush contains antioxidants like polyphenols, flavones and isoflavones, so it is not merely tasty but good for you as well.  This tea is caffeine free.  There are few tannins, so it will tolerate longer brewing times.  Try a cup at your local coffee shop if you're not certain you'll like it, but buy it here in bulk to save $.<br /><br />Many thanks to the kind folks at Stash for the free samples!
