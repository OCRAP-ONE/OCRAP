review/summary: Great, but not worth $12 a bag
review/text: $12 a bag if you include S&H. What? Are they hoping we're STUPID???? I bought the same tonight at the store down the street for less than $5! I was thinking about keeping the Chocolate Drawer at work replenished by auto-ordering every couple weeks, but this is just insane! I'm sure there are folks that never paid attention in 3rd grade math who will buy them anyway, poor suckers. There's always someone with more money than sense.

review/summary: #1 Rated Candy among Grandpas
review/text: 9 out of 10 Grandpas agree that Werther's Original Creamy Caramel Filled Hard Candies will stick to their false teeth, but is still well worth the battle.  Most Grandpas will opt to remove their dentures and just gum the sweet treat.<br /><br />I am not a grandpa, nor do I wear false teeth, yet I still enjoy these little chewy delights because they will fit inside my Fabric Waist Pack Many Colors! and the thin hard shell offers a moderate layer of insulation to the caramel when I am out and about on a hot day, such as at the largest flea market West of the Mississippi.

review/summary: Quite possibly.....the BEST?
review/text: I got addicted to Werthers Original Hard Candies years ago. The unique flavor became a favorite during long hikes in the mountains, and years of working in the desert. Many a weary hiker would smile when I would offer one of these to them along the trail....a simple, yet satisfying pleasure. These new cream filled morsels are even more of a good thing, but as most people will tell you, they don't last as long, and you wind up eating a LOT more of them. And they're even more addictive! I suspect that the Shortage has a lot to do with folks wanting to HOARD these things, and I can understand why, because that is exactly what I'm trying to do! I'll feel better when I have a case or 2 hidden away....in a cool dry place.

review/text: Unlike the chewy caramels which pull on your fillings, these are hard candy (which isn't really so hard) filled with a soft carmel center.  They are sooo very addictive it's amazing!  When you want just a touch of a sweet treat, pop in your mouth for a satisfying experience.  I received a package of these as well as 2 other new Werther's Original Caramel products as part of my bzzagent packet.  I am glad I took this campaign and so are those who I associated with that week as I heard not one complaint from anyone who tried them.  This is a buttery, satisfying treat!

review/summary: Werther's Original does not taste the same
review/text: I have been buying these little pleasures for many years and they have been consistently great; however, the past two orders - now up to 24 bags of 5.5 ounce hard candies - taste has changed drastically in my humble opinion.  Something is different.  Has anyone else experienced this?  I don't usually write reviews - probably my first now - but maybe some of you other consumers will let me know if you have the same opinion.  All bags are marked with 2012/10/31 -P35F expiration dates, so they are not too old.  The past years' quality taste is gone.  You all may know the great smiling feeling you get when you pop an original Werthers into your mouth - that is gone for me with this batch. I have compared these new candies with some of the ones left over - had to look in suit coat pockets and glove compartments to find any. I asked a few others their opinions of old versus new that I had given them, and we all agree - it is different - not as good - more like mass production generic candies now.  I complained to the Storck Company online, which is the only way I found to contact them. No address to write to, so I offered to send my defective candies to them for testing.  You can only write a few sentences on the website email, and then get cut off, so I had to write two emails and fill in all the info over and over.  The reply from Storck was a snail-mail letter thanking me for buying Werther's and 3 coupons for $1 off my next purchase.  They completely missed the point that something is wrong with this production and I don't want any more if they are going to be like this new taste - I just don't like it.  But that was not even mentioned.  I asked for a phone to call and discuss this, but that was ignored as well.  These candies are marginally OK as usual hard candies go, but the price is way to much for an average taste.  Amazon was great about it and sent me a few replacements, but the problem is- they are the same batch and taste the same unacceptable way. I want my old style original Werther's back!  I tried another few emails on the Werthers/Storck website, but that has gone unanswered for several weeks.  So I finally found an address in the European country Storck operates in, and wrote to the president to see if they will allow me to send my two dozen bags of 5.5 ounce Werthers back to them to test themselves.  That was last week, so I will have to give them a little time to respond internationally - if they will.  I remember when the experts changed Classic Coca Cola and what happened with that blunder.  I hope Werther's is not doing the same - but if that is their idea, I ask them to please take a lesson from Coke.  The old quality and attentio to excellence is what makes these candies sell.<br />I hope I am just missing something and it will all be explained that I got the wrong item or something.  Please let me know if you find the same thing happening with your order.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F542AE">Werther's Original Hard Candies, 5.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Good intentions gone terribly wrong.
review/text: While without any doubt I give the Werther's original and caramel chews a big 5, this candy doesn't really fit the bill at all.  For starters, the description on Amazon is totally misleading "Werther's Original Original Creamy Caramel Filled Bag" made me believe I was ordering the caramels, then to my dismay it was the hard candy with caramel filling.  Fortunately Amazon was very charitable and offered a refund given the truly needed change to the description.<br /><br />Besides this, the hard candy which is just a brittle shell mixed with a version of the caramel, but doesn't taste at all like the caramel chews, was very disappointing as I had actually tried the new candy from two bags purchased at my pharmacy.  The brittle shell really tastes nothing like the hard candy either making it feel like your eating hard candy while chewing gum.  What possessed Werther's to go this route is a bit of a mystery to me since their current tried and true products are perfect.

review/summary: The best tasting Izze by far!!!
review/text: I have tried many of the izze drinks, and I have to say that this one is my all time favorite.  A close second would be the apple.  I just love the flavor of this, its has such a nice sharp berry taste to it. Not bland in flavor at all.  Its not tart, but its not overly sweet at all, its just perfect.  It tastes similar to the blackberry but there is just something different about the blueberry that I cant describe, its just that wonderful.  All natural, no added sugar, and in each 12 fl oz bottle you get 2 servings of fruit, how can you beat that?  You will not be dissapointed at all in the blueberry izze, its just perfect.

review/summary: Enjoyed by dogs, both large and small
review/text: I have three large dogs, two labs(70+ lbs) and a mixed breed. My mother has a very small dog, about the size of a chiwawa. About once a month I pick up a pack of these Dentist's Best 5" Twists for my dogs, and pull one out from the pack for her pup. My dogs get them every so often as a treat or as something to keep them busy while something else is going on. They are able to have them eaten within an hour. My mothers dog chews on it for a month before she's able to eat through the whole thing. Which is why I just pull one twist out from the pack a month to give her.<br /><br />The dogs all enjoy them because they are easier for them to chew on the the traditional rawhide bones with rounded ends. Even though they do still get the much larger, regular shaped rawhide bones from time to time as well, they always prefer these because the shape and size make chewing on them so much easier. Their small size also tends to keeps dogs who swallow food without chewing thoroughly from choking. I have one dog who seems to always choke at some point on pieces of the large rawhide bones, then gets sick all over the floor. That is never an issue with these little sticks/twists. She's able to tear these up into small bit-sized piece and swallow them without any difficulties. They make great little snacks for dogs, of all sizes.

review/summary: Great Extract with Lovely Lemon Flavor
review/text: I was hesitant to buy a larger bottle at first because I had read some reviews regarding a clear bottle and a decrease in quality from OliveNation, so I bought the smallest container to try it out. I encourage you to ignore the previous review about there being alcohol in the extract: all extracts are suspended in alcohol- normally an pure fruit oil and alcohol mixture.<br /><br />Anyways, the extracts were well packaged and shipped quickly. I was pleased to find that the 4 oz container is tinted glass and the aroma is superb. I have used the extract in various baked goods and it provides a lovely hint of lemon.<br /><br />The only con about this item is that it is very subtle. I need to add what seems to me to be a lot of extract to get the dominate lemon flavor in things like lemon poppy seed muffins.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who is in short supply of fresh lemon juice. This makes an excellent substitution.

review/summary: Great but must be used as directed
review/text: The reason, I suspect, that people have varying results regarding glucose levels after eating Dreamfields concerns overcooking. Their website explains that it must be cooked precisely according to the individual box directions in order to retain the low carb aspect. This should probably be explained on the box as well. The website states:<br /><br />"It is very important not to overcook Dreamfields because over cooking can damage the protective matrix and increase the digestible carbs per serving. We also recommend pouring any sauce over the pasta just before serving. If the pasta is mixed in a pan with the sauce, do this only over low heat for a short amount of time."<br /><br />I don't cook mine even a minute longer than the the recommended time.<br /><br />With the exception of the lasagna noodles, it's not recommended for storage after cooking, either. The company recommends only preparing what you will consume at the time. Storage in a sauce, especially an acidic sauce (like one with tomatoes or vinegar), will also break down the protective matrix which prevents digestion.<br /><br />Needless to say, portion control is important, too. A diabetic friend told me that her blood sugar level rose significantly after eating it but, upon further questioning, she admitted she'd eaten almost the entire box at one time.<br /><br />This product does work, but has to be as directed.

review/text: This is so disappointing!  As someone who must restrict my carbohydrate intake (for my glycemic index), this Dreamfield's pasta is a fabulous find and I love the product performance; the price here wasn't bad, either.  HOWEVER, I ended up with an infestation of flour beetles (teeny tiny dark things, that don't really destroy anything as they eat grain products but DO cause an awfully annoying infestation) and the ONLY product in my huge pantry--we went through a couple hundred nonplastic or nonmetal-wrapped items items--where I found these bugs in UNopened packages was the Dreamfields pasta, and they were in all 8 remaining boxes of angel hair and in 6 of 8 remaining boxes of penne.  No bugs were apparent when the shipment arrived a couple or so months back.  When I found them inside the Dreamfields, the bugs were crawling over other items, speckled on the pantry ceiling, and had gotten inside a few other opened packages (especially a box of Milk Bone), but only this pasta had them inside unopened boxes (which were still semi-wrapped in plastic), as I said.  Thus I must conclude that this batch was the original source.  The boxes immediately went in the trash, would be unfair to try to return them, but since I'd only used 2 boxes when this was discovered, it was a big waste of money!  It took 4 hours and two of us to go through everything in the pantry, I promise I would never accuse any product specifically unless I had a pretty good idea of what happened.<br />Any way, love the product, it does not ever seem to spike my blood sugar, but I guess I won't be buying it in bulk again, even though it seems so convenient, because in the end it was horribly inconvenient and an expensive loss.

review/text: We have used this spaghetti for a couple of years now.  We were able to purchase it in grocery stores until we moved to an area that does not carry it. Many things for diabetics are not tasty but this spaghetti tastes just like the regular spaghetti without all the carbs.  We love it and were so very pleased to find it on Amazon.  We will continue to order this product and highly recommend it.  It is a good product for diabetics and anyone else.

review/text: I like marshmallow that has a squishy pillowy texture, the marshmallow in this is a bit on the firm side and doesnt contribute much to the overall flavor.  But in saying that the overall treat is not sickly sweet, as always Old Naples chocolate is a treat by itself but a nice little twist with the marshmallow for those who like a little extra.  Although I like these and recommend them I prefer the caramels.<br /><br />Shipment was fairly quick and included a cool pack to keep everything protected from the heat.

I can only drinks sips at a time, as it is very strong.  Apple cider vinegar enthusiasts would love this drink, as it reminds me of drinking vinegar.  I'm not sorry that I purchased it, but will not likely buy again.

review/text: Culinary Teas Gourmet Teas Pumpkin Spice Tea<br /><br />Price: >$16 (4oz bag shipping added to my total) Purchased through amazon<br /><br />Caff-O-Meter: Undetermined, I'd estimate 15-30 since the base is not all black tea<br />Ingredients:<br />Luxury Black tea, Hibiscus, Rosehip, Almond pieces, Cinnamon pieces, Rooibos, Vanilla pieces, Apple pieces + Natural dried Orange, Sunflower + Calendula petals, Triacetin, Natural flavors.<br /><br />-Smell (.5) - The smell is not very strong nor does it remind me of pumpkin  or fall. Scent falls flat<br /><br />-Taste<br /><br />+Unsweetened:<br />++Hot (.5) - Does not taste like anything other than normal tea.<br />++Iced (1) - again no flavor is present aside from just tea to me<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (1.5)- Adding the sweetener (.5 pkg of truvia) usually makes flavors stick out, and until I added the sweetener I didn't detect anything other than just black tea.<br />++Iced (2) -  So Iced with sweetener is the only way I find this tea to be enjoyable.<br /><br />2nd Steep (2) it maintains its flavor through a second steep but I'm still not impressed.<br /><br />Summary -  I really wanted to like this tea but it just didn't do it for me. The tea was very weak, perhaps I will try to double the strength in a few days and update my rating. to me it just tastes very bland.<br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp per 16 oz water) "steep" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference. I use plain Lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea).<br /><br />*** I have spoken with the seller who has assured me the tea is not old. You cant make everyone happy flavor wise and this was just not for my palette, I have a feeling it may be due to tea having no sweetener added and I prefer a sweetness to my tea. I am very pleased with the professionalism of the seller  and I will be giving them the full rating.

review/text: All I can say is, WOW! I read the other reviews for this product here on Amazon. I thought that surely it couldn't be as good as everyone was saying. I mean, come on. It's only salsa.<br /><br />I'm here to tell you. This stuff is the best salsa I have ever had. (I eat salsa just about everyday.) I would love it if it was a little more chunky but the flavor just can't be beat.<br /><br />The medium has a little bit of a kick to it, but not as much as I would have expected. I added a few tablespoons of Texas Pete hot sauce to about a cup of this stuff and that kicked it up a few notches.<br /><br />My wife asked why I bought this from Amazon when it is available at Costco. Then she realized she hasn't seen it there in a while. I will be checking soon to see if our Costco has it. I think 10 bucks a jar is a little too much to pay for it at Amazon and that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />Try it though. You are in for a treat.

review/text: I've always liked tomato-based sauces on my foods. Ketchup, seafood cocktail sauce, chile sauce and salsa are all in my cabinets. They can brighten up a host of different foods. I particularly like salsas, and my favorites are fresh salsas. However, there's always a preservation problem. As such, I usually have a couple jars of salsa in my pantry This week, I found some bottled Kirkland Signature medium organic salsa on my trip to our local Costco Store. Well, I hadn't noticed this before and it must be something new. I had to try it.<br /><br />This Kirkland Organic Salsa is quite good, just about the best bottled salsa I can remember. Good flavor. The right amount of zest for me. A nice fine-chunky texture. I tried it on some ravioli last night and on a plate of scrambled eggs this morning. Excellent! It's good I like it because with two 38-ounce bottles, there's a lot of it. I'm not worried. It won't last long. This is good stuff!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Fruit that is as addictive as candy
review/text: These dried apricots taste wonderful--it's hard to stop eating them! If you are expecting beautiful golden color you'll have to adapt to dried organic fruit which does not keep the original color. They are not dried with sulfur dioxide, which makes them healthier. I recommend them wholeheartedly.

review/text: Husband loves dried apricots.  These are very good quality overall.  Have had a bag or two over the years that seems to have a grainy flour texture coating on the inside-- doesn't bother me but it does my husband.  Try them with a dollup of peanut butter on it as a snack.  Like a PBJ without the bread!  Love it!  Yummy and reasonably priced for organic dried apricots that are unsulphured.

review/summary: Covered in white powdery fuzz, no expiration date
review/text: The apricots were shipped with, what looked like, specs of white powder all over them, that in a few days times turned to white fuzzy mold. Clearly these apricots were sitting in the back of a warehouse somewhere, for months (possibly longer). Amazon was great in offering an exchange. I hope my replacements will be mold-free. If so, I will alter my rating. But considering how much money I've shelled out for these, they shouldn't arrive in the horrific condition that they did.<br />Further warning: the bags don't have any expiration dates listed, so there's no way of knowing how old they are, or when they expire.

review/summary: Product is not dried properly and can rapidly mold
review/text: These apricots are of high quality, however they seem to be packaged too moist, and rapidly develop a white mold.  The spooky part is, the mold looks like sugar, and some folks, especially kids, might mistake it for a normal condition.  A couple of other things are odd:  There is no expiration date on the package, and each bag has a hole in the bottom, looking as if it has been punctured by a needle.  After a month or so in storage, all 8 of my remaining bags were in the same decomposing condition.<br />Please see attached pictures under product information, images section.

review/summary: Great organics, not the best cots for flavor
review/text: Yes I have eaten organics before, the brown color has no effect on me whatsoever........... but, these taste more like big fluffy raisins, not apricots.  There's a hint of 'cot, but there is more 'cot in Apricot Pyramid Beer than these.  That said, they are what they are and they are great for regularity and great to send as gifts - dried California organic fruit.<br /><br />I should say I am used to slab 'cots from casa de fruta, and these do not resemble in any way those dried 'cots even though they use sulfur dioxide, they are juicier and sweeter and taste like apricots.  Even Casa de Fruta's basic 'cots taste better than these.  I ordered on subscription, but will cancel today and have at least 4-6 gifts for Christmas already.

review/text: It takes a lot more of this product to flavor a 16-20oz water bottle than I expected, and I was anticipating more of a tang flavor. That being said, I would rather use this product than one filled with artificial ingredients. Also, unrelated to the product itself, the company first sent me the wrong order and then the bottle came broken and leaking from the box.  I had a new one sent within the week, but was still a hassle. Took up to 3 weeks to get my actual order. Again, that inconvenience isn't reflected in my rating.

review/text: We cut these up into small pieces for our Corgi pup (so each treat actually becomes 8-10 mini treats) to prevent throwing off his diet.  This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!

Use the container as a shaker to help train your dog to come, and the other treats get a liver flavored (dust) coating that makes your dog love them even more!

They do quite often reject other treats, and certainly after a while of the same other treats.  But then tend to always enjoy these. In fact, I have to be careful not to over feed them these because I don't know if they are healthy to eat in quantity.  Certainly not for my wallet.  They do last a LONG time though, especially compare to their weight.  However, dogs wolf them down quite quickly.  I highly recommend you reward you doggies with some!

The tricks he'd do for the Pro-Treats were really entertaining.

review/text: Getting grain free treats for training usually leaves three options: hard biscuits (and who wants to work for those?), cooked meat (which is gross to handle), or commercial meaty grain-free treats which cost an arm and a leg.<br /><br />These on the other hand, are very affordable, not gross to handle, and the dogs think they smell AMAZING.  They work great when your dog's attention is wavering - a waff of freeze dried beef liver usually snaps them back to attention!<br /><br />Also, being as they're only beef liver, I don't feel bad feeding my dog as many as needed for training.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
