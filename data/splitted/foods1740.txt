review/summary: fish flavor, tastes good, not for me
review/text: White guy who is trying different things and likes alot of the asian stuff ive tried before.  i didnt know this would be pretty fishy.  i made mine with shrimp and yellow onions (last minute decision, no green onions).  it was more fishy flavored than i thought it would be.  not too much, but just on the edge of acceptable for me.  this might be how all laksa is but i wasnt a huge fan.  i probably just dont like laksa though.  i like other prima taste products, but i think just not this one.

review/summary: Yummy Treat!
review/text: I love this candy! It has a pleasant, mildly sweet (rice flour) taste and the texture is similar to a powdered, soft gummy bear. The melon flavor is mild and sweet (not sour). This candy may be an acquired taste for someone who is accostumed to mainstream, super-sweet American candy. The texture may take some getting used to and the taste of rice flour may not appeal to some. All that said, I've been trying to find this candy for several years but because I didn't know the name of it, I've been making-do with my memories. Now that I've found a merchant, I plan on buying a stockpile.

review/text: I love japanese treats snacks and most things but its problematic  because i absolutely dislike bean paste. I had been trying to find a mochi type of snack with out a red bean paste filling for some time and wandered across this gem. I ordered 1 pack to see how it was and the mochi is as soft and gummy as the day it was made and the filling is just delicious. I will probably proceed to stockpile these and eat them all! please enjoy and try them out.

review/summary: Hmmm...
review/text: My honest opinion, beautiful, but strange tasting, and made me feel a little sick. They tasted good enough so that I ate five more quickly after eating the first, and did notice a melon flavor, but it seemed quickly muted by this odd sweet taste that made me feel ill. It wasn't highly unpleasant, but made it taste what I thought was overly candy like and so turned what could have tasted like something pleasant, into a cheap candy taste, that was too strong and so made me feel sick. Also the powdery consistency in the middle I don't think was strong enough, I noticed more of the soft outer covering than the filling, which was more interesting and so wanted to taste that more, but it was so easy to chew that it passed into me fast and was gone in a moment.

review/summary: Melon-tastic!
review/text: I have to say that out of all the flavors that have graced my tongue from Japan, Melon is my favorite. It is such a refreshing flavor and its not too sweet. Daifuku is like a marshmallow stuffed with flavored paste or jelly. It takes a bit to get used to, but once you overcome the different texture its amazing. I prefer my cold so I keep them in the fridge, I also know some Japanese people who keep them in the freezer. I really recommend trying these, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

review/summary: Best Japanese rice candy ever!!!
review/text: I had browsed this product several times before I finally decided to give it a try, and I'm glad that I did!  This is one of the best treats I have ever tasted!  It has the perfect balance of delicious melon flavor that is not drowned out by an overdose of sugar like most American candies and has a wonderful texture that isn't too sticky.  I had tried Japanese bean cakes with red bean paste before and found them to be OK, but after tasting these treasures, I won't be eating those again!  Veryasia was great to deal with as well--communication from the company and the shipping of the product was very prompt.  I would highly recommend this company and this product.  This delightful candy is one of those rare, not-to-be-missed treats for the tastebuds that everyone should try!

review/summary: Only daifuku I like!
review/text: I've tried a variety of Daifuku and Melon is the only flavor I love. The Rice cake is mildly sweet with a thick jelly like texture you can squeeze in your hands with a light corn starch coating so it won't stick everywhere. The Melon filling is sweet with a light melon flavor sort of like gum that you can't chew. I don't know if I'm turning you on or off to the product but it's very delicious and sometimes I like to eat the filling separate from the cake. They are both quite good on their own and neither overpowers the other in flavor.

review/text: These are very delicious little Desserts with a gooey melon center and a great alternative to average high fat cakes. The texture at first may seem a bit odd to many, but the taste is wonderful. It's a very clean, natural taste and I highly recommend them. But you only get eight cakes, and you will be wishing for more when you have finished with them. So I suggest you buy at least two or three packs at a time.

review/summary: Taste Good!
review/text: My friend is really into different asian foods and I am getting more and more into them so I figured that I would try this mochi. It ended up tasting really good. It's not like other mochis that I have tried. It's sweeter for starters and has mellon filling inside. Around the filling there is something that seems to be a marshmallow thin layer and then the outside rice ball layer. This mochi though is not like normal asian mochi so be for-warned if you like mochi to be semi-sweet this might not be for you. But if you like other asian mellon candy I think that you will like this. The color is also brighter that the photo shown.

review/text: Ever since I have seen these here on Amazon I have always wanted to try them. It took a while, but I bought some. They came earier than expected, but all the same I was still pretty excited. Being into Japanese culture and all.<br /><br />I was a little surprised when I had my first bite. I did not expect the texture to be like that. But I loved it all the same. Its nice and soft, almost like biting into a marshmallow. It's really nice, and sweet too. Not way too sweet like most American candy. To me the sweetness level is perfect.<br /><br />So I believe its a nice treat to have once in a while. Even nicer is that the eight pieces could last longer than other snacks since just one if good enough for a few hours. [At least for it is like that]<br /><br />Anyway I'll be sure to order more in the future.

The color of these Daifuku looks quite disgusting as they have some kind of glowing green color, which looks very different from the picture they have it up there. After the first bite, I threw the whole pack into trash can. Yar, it is that bad.<br /><br />I don't know why it has such high ratings among other reviewers. I guess it is either those people have been eating really bad snacks or my pack just got spoiled during the shipment. Either way, I personally don't like this product at all.

review/text: Illy issimo caff&egrave; Italian espresso style coffee drink is a 6.8 fl. oz. (200 ml) blast of sweetened caffeine in a can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a slightly bitter dark roast coffee taste with the right amount of sugar and a pleasant mouthfeel.

review/text: I hope there's nothing too pernicious in this tea because I drink one cup a day during the weekdays and three cups on Saturday, Sunday and bank holidays.<br /><br />These are big cups so I add another bag of plain black tea to slightly cut the vanilla flavour and make the drink stronger.  Right now this is Saturday morning and I'm on my second cup.<br /><br />I tried Bigelow's other flavoured teas and thought they were undrinkable - I was acutely conscious of consuming some kind of artificial additive.  I am with this tea also, which accounts for my first sentence.

This way is less expensive, and so convenient.  We stay one order ahead as a couple of years ago, Bigelow had a supply problem.<br /><br />I use a Russell Hobbs Tea Kettle with warming tray, so my water heats up to the correct temperature, brews in a separate glass pot and stays on a warming tray.  I have a pot on all day long.  I do love my tea.  I love that Amazon ships directly to my home.

Sadly, it has been disappearing from my local grocers' shelves and I can only find it in one specialty store.

I signed up to get six boxes delivered to my door every 3 months.  This convenient service costs me just a little over half what I was paying at the specialty store.  There was a mix up with my first order that caused me to receive 2 shipments at once, but I have been assured that this has been sorted out.<br />I would highly recommend this tea to any tea drinker.  The vanilla flavoring can't be missed, but is not so strong that it overpowers the tea.  This tea has never tasted bitter or "strong enough to trot a mouse" even when I go over the brew time.  Always delivers a smooth flavorful cuppa. It's not an exotic, upmarket tea, but if you are looking for a good, smooth tasting everyday cup of tea, give this one a try.  I give the tea 5 stars and the convenient Amazon delivery 4 & 1/2 stars that maybe should also be 5 star.  I did get a double order....could have been my human error, or their human error or computer glitch.  Customer service was excellent and the duplicate was returned at no cost to myself.  Overall, I am 5 star happy with both product and Amazon.<br />The Amazon provided price of $14.ish drops to $12.ish when you sign up for the regular scheduled delivery....and free shipping...whatta deal!

review/summary: Wonderful tea
review/text: This tea has a wonderful vanilla flavor mixed in with Bigelow's fine tea.  I was always able to get it in a couple of local grocery stores.  However, everything on the shelves seems to be green tea, or some spicy Chai tea.  For a tea with a great flavor that even makes great iced tea, you can't go wrong with this one.  It's a winner!

review/summary: Bigelow succeeds again
review/text: I like Bigelow teas a great deal.  They typically have rich flavors and it is easy to drink cup after cup.  While not my favorite Bigelow tea, the French Vanilla is robust in its composition.  I only give it four stars because while it is a very drinkable tea, I wouldn't consider this a vanilla tea.  The ingredients include black tea, natural and artificial flavors and I would have anticipated that vanilla be explicitly noted.  It's definitely a good tea, but I wanted something that was more heavily accented with vanilla.

review/summary: Excellent French Vanilla taste
review/text: I drink this tea at all different times--breakfast, lunch, and after dinner. The French Vanilla flavor is bold but smooth, and not at all syrupy tasting. No other brand of French Vanilla tea that I have tried equals it for taste. Sometimes I drink it with honey and milk, which is amazing.<br /><br />While I usually don't drink coffee with caffeine in the evening because it keeps me from falling asleep, not so with this tea.<br /><br />If you are looking for a truly delicious French Vanilla flavored tea, look no further. I buy this at my local supermarket, which usually has it in stock, for about the same price as on Amazon, so I don't need to buy six boxes at a time.

I will order these again and I recommend this product to other apricot lovers.

review/summary: "PREMIUM-IZED" (Adulterated) APRICOTS
review/text: I am disappointed in the description of this product on Amazon. But I have to blame myself for the purchase because I could have gone to the Mariani website and seen that they DO NOT call these "Dried Apricots" [http://shop.mariani.com/Mediterranean-Apricots/p/MAR-1140091&c=Mariani@OrchardFruit].<br /><br />The product listing mainline on Amazon is: "Mariani Premium DRIED Ultimate Apricots 48 oz. Resealable Value Bag by Mariani" [caps are mine]. (That line is repeated also in Amazon's "Product Features".) The ONLY place on this product's bag that the words "Dried Apricots" appear is in the INGREDIENT list.<br /><br />The front of the bag says, "Premium - Intense Flavor and Aroma - Ultimate Apricots," and the back of the bag says, "We've taken our most luscious Mediterranean Apricots and infused them with a natural flavor essence to create Mariani Ultimate Apricots". Few of the apricots would qualify as "dry" compared to the dry apricots I've eaten my entire life (a long time) and some of them are almost mushy. When you open the bag it smells a bit like a fruity wine. No, I don't think they have fermented, I just think the odor is that special, ". . . natural flavor essence" that the MANUFACTURER adds to the DRIED APRICOTS!<br /><br />Although I don't like to publish "indelicacies", these are also the first dried fruit (including prunes) that ever gave me the bends from gas. I am not suggesting that will happen to everyone, but after eating some (a reasonable number) of them 2 days in a row and being symptomatic, then eating none and not being symptomatic, then repeating the process, I am a bit beyond buying into the theory of coincidence as a cause.

review/summary: ***NOT*** GLUTEN FREE
review/text: This product has two markings:<br /><br />1. Gluten Free<br /><br />2. Allergen Information: This product was packed on equipment that also packages products that contain milk, soy, wheat, and tree nuts.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was so happy to see "gluten free," I failed to read on to see the allergen statement which indicates the exact opposite of "gluten free." I ate these for two days - and paid for it each time - before I realized my mistake in trusting the first indication of "gluten free."<br /><br />If you are allergic to gluten or a celiac, DO NOT consume this product.<br /><br />I am very disappointed when businesses don't take these allergies seriously - in this case, by placing two contradictory statements regarding allergens on their packaging, and, of course, emphasizing the one that increases the appeal of the product to a specific group of people vulnerable to allergic reactions. In particular, reactions due to celiac have permanent effects on people's lives and health, including an increased risk of cancer, and a failure to recognize this is blatantly irresponsible and should be prosecuted.

review/summary: Gives you smelly farts, worst apricot product ever had
review/text: This product can be summed up in one word, GARBAGE. This is not even worthy for compost, because it has been tainted with all sorts of chemicals, preservatives and "natural flavors", whatever the heck that means.<br /><br />The ingredients list is as follows;<br />Dried apricots (from Turkey)<br />Natural Flavors<br />Medium Chain Triglycerides<br />Sulfur Dioxide = Uncontrollable smelly farts<br />Sodium Bisulfite = Uncontrollable smelly farts<br />Potassium Sorbate.<br /><br />This is a good product if you're going to shoot a prank video that involves you having to fart really loud and smelly in someones face or something, but other than that I can't think of why you would want to buy this product, in my opinion it is complete waste of money. On the package it is advertised as "premium" and "intense flavor and aroma". Allow me to clarify, if by premium they mean premium tainted apricots then that is spot on, and by intense flavor and aroma what they mean is the smell of sulfur coming off these apricots is so intense you'll be farting every minute for the next 3 hours.<br /><br />Shame on Mariani for wasting so many apricots. Worst apricots ever. I would Strongly NOT recommend this product, buy organic apricots instead.

review/summary: Knead a little taste of home? Add water and knead in some flour to make it at home.
review/text: This is a product from my home town.  Swedish Limpa Rye is a sweet, dense, moist, and dark rye bread.  The color of this bread is lighter than you would expect if you've seen a dark rye, but the richness of flavor (orange and rye) reminds you it's still the rye bread you remember from childhood.  This is a dry mix and makes one loaf.  The crust crisps and the interior is so moist it makes for great toaster bread (slice thick).  Make a grilled cheese with American cheese and be generous with butter.  Delicious!  You do need to knead the bread and must have some flour on hand for the couple of times you have to work the dough.  No stand mixer needed.  Need two loaves?  Buy two bags.  Check out Sturdiwheat's pancake mix and Fish Coating mix.  The original flavors are fantastic.  The pancake mix is hearty with alot of texture from the grains used and so is the coating mix.  We oven-roast potatoes and nearly any other garden vegetable with a quick toss in the coat on an oil-lined baking dish.  We pan-fry fish and chicken in the same coating.  It's sweet, a little peppery, and extremely crunchy.  I buy the coat mix by the dozen.  Each bag of coating makes more than one recipe of fish, chicken, and vegetable.

review/summary: Stale Candy was Smashed and Difficult to unwrap
review/text: When it comes to soft, edible candy it's hard to separate the packaging from the treat itself since we enjoy these sweets with more than our taste buds. I still hesitated to factor the packaging into this review, but ultimately decided that the candy itself wasn't very fresh either. I thought it may have been just a few pieces that were hard/stale, but it's pretty much all of them. I don't know if I received a stroke of bad luck or if the entire supply shipping from Amazon is old. My candy was also severely smashed making the caramel stick to the wrappers. I'm a fairly lazy person so it's a chore to fight with the wrappers to remove them when I want a piece of candy. The cookie part of the Twix were crushed as well and some of the chocolate had that chalky white thing going on.

review/summary: OMH dog biscuits
review/text: I agree with another review in that too many biscuits are broken when they arrive at my house. BTW I had the same problem buying them directly at the store.<br /><br />I have fed my dogs these biscuits for about 25 years. The dogs love these biscuits but the real reason I feed them is because they are the hardest biscuits I have been able to find. The dogs take a long time to eat them and have to do a lot of chewing. This cleans their teeth. Since I started feeding these biscuits not one vet has suggested that my dog's teeth needed cleaning. I've probably had 5 or 6 dogs in that time and 5 or 6 vets too. I figure what I've saved in cleanings has more than paid for the biscuits plus the dogs like the biscuits.<br /><br />One thing worth noting is that my dog's diet is more than half dry food; I don't know if a dog on a wet food diet would have the same success.

They're on the smaller size as far as dog biscuits go - shaped like peanuts in the shell (and are a little larger than the actual size of a peanut).  We particularly like them because they fit perfectly into a medium sized Kong toy - and because they are shaped like a peanut - you can shove them so they get kind of stuck in the Kong and it takes the dog a while to get it out.

review/text: Although these delicious delicacies can stand on their own merit, they have a know reputation.  Everyone remembers the red stapler from "Offices Space" (1999). But only a connoisseur would associate gummy bears with "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986). While Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) was making his principal getaway on a school bus, a young lady offered him a gummy bear. It was warm and chewy as she kept them in her pocket.<br /><br />You do not need to keep these animals in your pocket to enjoy them. Just be aware that they may not blend well with temporary fillings. You can just suck on them in that case.

review/text: My son has loved this since he was a baby, he loves the satin parts. He is now 20mos and still loves it so much that I had to buy a spare.<br />The only negative is that it says it is "spot" clean only. I'm sorry but who creates something for children that you can't put in the washing machine.

review/summary: Limited Availability of Canada Dry Diet Cranberry Ginger Ale
review/text: Could easily find this in the Wash DC area about ten years ago and loved it.  Since moving to California in 2002 have been unable to find it.  Contacted local distributors and got no explanation why.  Have since learned Canada Dry seems to be playing games with the availability of their diet cranberry ginger ale.  Seems odd a product so popular and in high demand would intentionally be kept from public.  What's the reason Canada Dry?

review/summary: Excellent Organic Green Tea
review/text: The previous reviewer did not read the description, nor pay attention to the picture on the tin.<br /><br />The tin clearly shows both green tea leaves, and matcha powder. The product description also clearly states that this product is "organic green tea powder known as matcha with fine, organic green leaf tea". In other words, the tea bag contains green tea leaves, along with a bit of matcha powder.<br /><br />It is an excellent tea if you are the casual tea drinker, or someone looking for a healthy, tasty and organic green tea (with a bit of added benefit of the matcha powder). If you are a true matcha drinker, then this is not the product for you.<br /><br />I find this to be an excellent organic green tea.

review/summary: Passable as green tea, but "matcha" is misleading
review/text: When I saw this at the store, I thought, "Wow! How did they capture the flavor of matcha in a tea bag?" The short answer is: they didn't.<br /><br />This is an acceptable (not great) plain green tea. The flavor is a bit stale, but I recognize that we're talking about pre-bagged leaves. It's certainly nothing to write home about. It also brews up weak for a green tea (and I'm familiar with how green tea should brew - I'm not comparing it to a black tea).<br /><br />My major issue with this tea is the same issue that the first reviewer had. It is misleading to label this as "matcha tea powder with green tea leaves", because that statement implies that it will taste like matcha mixed with green tea. The actual tea does not deliver on this promise. There is no matcha flavor whatsoever to this tea when brewed. It tastes like a straight green tea (and as I mentioned previously, not even a very good green tea). Where's the matcha???<br /><br />The reality is that it was silly of me to get sucked in by their marketing, because there's simply no way that the matcha experience can be recreated in a teabag. Here's why, for those of you who are interested:<br /><br />Matcha tea is prepared in a completely different manner than green tea brewed from leaves. If you're reading this review, you already know that making green tea from leaves involves pouring hot water over the dried leaves/teabag, allowing it to steep, then removing the leaves/teabag. In comparison, matcha tea is made by placing a scoopful of matcha powder in a bowl, adding hot water, and then whisking with a bamboo tea whisk until the powder is completely dissolved into the water. How can that be recreated in a teabag? It can't be. In these teabags, there's only an extremely minor amount of matcha powder, not even enough to even be noticeable in flavor. Plus, you're not whisking it to create the distinctive matcha consistency. These are just teabags that have been lightly dusted with matcha powder to create a puff of green powder when you open the tin, so you think you're getting your "matcha money's worth" for buying this flavor instead of regular green tea.<br /><br />Sorry, Republic of Tea. I usually enjoy your teas, but this one fell far short. I won't be buying it again.

review/text: I bought this tea yesterday, splurging $13.49 at Central Market. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this was a big let down. It's not strong or flavorful enough. When I order green matcha tea at the bookstore it is delicious, strong and flavorful.(not sugared up) Wouldn't recommend it. You can buy green tea at Costco that is just as good for a fraction of the price.

review/summary: "Double" in what sense?
review/text: I guess if they mean "twice as much matcha as green teas that don't have ANY matcha," then they easily exceed that, because you can definitely smell a hint of matcha when you open the tin - it's in there, all right.  I'll bet lab tests would confirm it.<br /><br />However, the tea itself has almost no discernible matcha flavor.  The experience is like drinking a pretty good cup of normal tea-bag green tea, while somebody across the table from you has a cup of matcha.<br /><br />It's not *bad* - it's a good cup of green tea, but there are lots of good cups of green tea, several of them from the same company.  What's supposed to set this one apart is the matcha component, and it just doesn't.<br /><br />Buy matcha if you want matcha, buy regular green tea if you want regular green tea, and buy this if you'd like to mix the two in a 3%-97% ratio, but don't have sensitive enough equipment to do it yourself.

review/text: I really like this Double Green Matcha tea. I prefer the taste to the other green teas offered by Tea Republic. The price is reasonable and it is better than most readily available green tea out there. I can brew to large cups of tea from one bag without losing much flavor in the second cup. This is my everyday go to tea. There is a decent amount of matcha powder in the tea. It tasts great as ice tea as well. The only green tea that I like a lot more is from Mellow Monk and it is much more expensive.

review/summary: A smooth green tea, and it does remind me of Japan
review/text: In Japan, you're offered green tea with most meals, often free of charge. It's been years since I visited, but there are many flavors that I've simply not been able to replicate since I've been there. This green tea comes closest to that memory. It's a smooth tea, without a lot of harshness or bitterness found in other brands of green tea I've tried here in the States.<br /><br />If Matcha experts are saying it doesn't come close, then they're probably right. I'm just saying this is a smooth tea, and a nice delicate flavor. I'm not a big tea drinker, and I'm pretty cautious about buying a box since I know I'll probably not finish it. I often find a cup of tea difficult to get through because of the bitter or tart flavor. Then if I drown it in sweeteners, it just tastes worse, and I feel worse for drinking it. I feel confident that I'll finish this entire can easily, helping me stay on teas instead of less healthy drinks.

review/summary: Innova EVO helps my cats be healthy
review/text: We lost our first cat to stomach cancer when she was only 6 years old.  When we adopted our two new cats, I did a lot of research on nutrition.  I found that the grocery store brand dry food we fed our first cat was full of unnecessary carbs and fillers like corn and wheat.  Cats don't need carbs in their diet, because in the wild they would be eating live prey, and the prey's stomach contents would be the only grains the cat would get.  Keeping that in mind, I became an avid label reader.  I now feed my cats 1 can of Innova EVO or similar quality food each day, plus 1/2 cup of Innova EVO dry kibble.  If I had the time and the local resources to feed a raw diet, I would.  But Innova EVO, in combination with other super premium foods and the occasional treat of raw chicken meat, bones and organs, gives my guys super shiny coats and lots of energy.  The litter box is also not as stinky since they absorb many more nutrients.  I now have two healthy one-year-old cats who look forward to meal times and don't have any health problems.  They are well-behaved and don't shed much at all.

review/summary: Best damn thing since sliced bread
review/text: I heard of Tim Tams thanks to Wikipedia, they sounded good, but I didn't pay much attention as I figured I'd never be able to try them. However, my curiousity was piqued when I saw these badboys at my local Target, and my friend Charlie being the generous man he was, bought me the Caramel Tim Tam, he bought the regular. When we got to his place that night, we tried them, and I was hooked. The chocolatey goodness surrounding two crunchy wafers, a creamy filling in the center, and of course the caramel which is chewy after a few seconds, talk about silky and heavenly! Of course, the regular ones kick ass too so you know. But seriously these things just rock.<br /><br />Everything about this cookie/biscuit is high quality, the chocolate is very tasty on all counts. The wafers have a crisp unlike anything I've tried before in my life, and the chocolate cream is wow, and the caramel, it starts off a bit hard at first, but softens up after a few seconds in your mouth. Minus that part for the regular Tim Tam, but you got the idea basically. Long story short, Tim Tams rock, and you all need to slam a few down.

review/text: I love Tim Tam's, and I searched when I found Pepperidge Farms was coming out with them. That version I can cheerfully pass by. I don't share my Australian ones, even the kids know not to ask. The difference? The original has a very light crumbly cookie, the center melts when exposed to hot liquid into a sublime smooth rich cream and the outside chocolate has so little wax it will melt in your hand. Even several months old Arnott's Tim Tams are better. The US version by Pepperidge Farms has a stiff chocolate coating, a thicker cookie-less porous, and the center leaves a greasy mouth feel. Very disappointing.<br /><br />If you have not tried Arnott's Tim Tams, these are a pleasant creme-filled cookie covered in chocolate and probably good for chocoholics.
