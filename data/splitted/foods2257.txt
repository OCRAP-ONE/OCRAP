review/summary: Best coconut water we've tried
review/text: This stuff is delicious, sweet and fresh-tasting - no strange aftertastes like some brands (*cough* Vitacoco *cough*)- and the only ingredient is coconut water!  No preservatives, stabilizers, thickeners, or sweeteners. I'm hooked.

review/summary: This seasoning used to be so good but now its trash!
review/text: I grew up using Old El Paso taco seasoning but within the past year the company changed their recipe and now the seasoning is horrible.  If you go to the Betty Crocker website for this product you'll see upwards of 50 negative comments asking that the seasoning to be changed back to what it used to be.  If it says "original" beware because its just deceptive packaging.<br /><br />It's a shame because they had a customer for life in me but now I'm in search of a new seasoning.<br /><br />If anyone has a similar alternative to this seasoning please let me know.  Don't suggest your favorite seasoning, just one that is similar to the old OEP mix. Thanks!

review/summary: Wonderful Stuff!
review/text: I have been using Giovanni Body Wash (White Tea scent) for several years now. I have extremely sensitive skin, prone to acne, rashes and irritations when using most other soaps. I have wasted tons of money trying soap after soap hoping to find something that wouldn't irritate my skin, lathering well, while leaving me feeling clean. This soap has a really nice, soft scent, washes skin clean of dirt and oil and leaves no soap scum after rinsed off. This is the only soap I have found that does not cause break-outs/irritations and lathers well. I truely wish I could find a more econonmcal product that does the same job as this body wash but still haven't found one. So I try to find really good deals when buying this body wash to help off set the cost.<br /><br />Please note: this soap is a little drying.. so if you already have a dry skin conidtion this may not be the soap for you. I lived in a very warm humid climate when I started using this soap and did not notice the drying effect until I moved to a much cooler and dryer area. With that being said Giovanni also sells one of the best moisturizers I have ever used, it's their body butter (comes in the same scents as the body washes). This body butter works fantasticly! I am in the health care field and have to wash my hands many, many times a day. If I put some of the body butter on at night right before I go to sleep, my hands are moisturized all the next day without reapplying! I have tried many moisturizers that seems to work great until you wash your hands, then its like you never had any on in the first place... the body butter is not like this.

review/summary: Where's the moisture?
review/text: Ok, so I absolutely love the packaging and the nifty description on the back of the bottle, but when I'm paying .64/oz, I expect it to moisturize. Giovanni claims that their washes include "essential oil complex to soothe, smooth and regenerate skin's lost moisture" but the ingredients' list contains no such ingredient, unless they are referring to the "Essential Oil Fragrance" in which case they are blatantly lying because essential oils provide scent, not moisture. Even the dollar bottles of cheapo wash at Walmart contain some type of moisturizer, albeit petroleum. Sometimes I use St. Ives Whipped Silk body wash and it's definitely more moisturizing than Giovanni due to the sunflower oil. I've noticed even JASON's washes contain Sodium PCA to moisturize (although their stuff also has harsh sulfates, so I've never tried them). Or maybe Giovanni deliberately left out any moisturizers out so that we buy their lotions/body butters. Ha!<br /><br />While I sound like I hate the product, I really don't; I just wish it provided some moisture. The good: it looks and feels like a spa product, washes well and rinses cleanly, and smells good and not artificial perfumey like Herbal Essences and all that other junk. Also, it actually works well as a shampoo when in a pinch. In fact, I've taken to using it as shampoo as well since Giovanni keeps changing their shampoo formulas (and for the worse, it seems, judging from the new ingredients) and body washes tend to be more gentle than shampoos. I've tried Raspberry Winter, Lavender Vanilla Snow, Cassifluer White Tea, and D:tox (bar soap form) and they all smell awesome. True aromatherapy in a bottle.

review/text: This is the best bottled jerk marinade I have found. It isn't very spicy which is great when cooking for my family. I love this on chicken, pork and burgers. It takes about an hour to marinate but I've had the best results marinating overnight. When I want more authentic jerk taste I add some Walkerswood Jerk to the marinade and that kick up the spice an incredible amount. My kids cant do the Walkerswood. I recently made chicken with this at a BBQ and I had to send one guest home with a bottle of this sauce.....thats how good the chicken was. I hate that i cant find this in my local market anymore but Amazon has me covered, so no worries.

Some in my family don't like sweet food and enjoyed this.  A good way to use it is in the crock pot over a pork butt.  Make a fruit salsa and you have the makings of a delicious taco.

review/summary: Good Product But Overpriced
review/text: This is quality vegetable broth; the only problem is that it is very much overpriced. You get twelve 16-ounce boxes for $31.68. Please take note that at 16 ounces, each box is one-half the size of the normal, 32-ounce (one quart) stock boxes that you see in the supermarket. So, you're basically paying for six quarts of stock. $31.68 divided by six equals $5.28 per quart, way overpriced. Even in expensive Manhattan markets, a one quart box of stock sells for $2.99. Caveat emptor and happy cooking.

review/text: Valentines day is all about flowers and chocolates and getting some action once a year. At least that's what the commercials tell us. In our house we don't play by the rules, therefore chocolates aren't gonna be heart shaped and taste like waxy butt.<br /><br />One of my Fiance's drinks of choice is Jameson's Whiskey and Cranberry Juice. We call it a "Slutty Laura" named after me of course. Looking for a sweet treat for V Day I came across these. Butlers Jamesons Irish Whiskey Truffles. PERFECT!<br /><br />Most liquor/chocolate combos are made of seriously crappy chocolate surrounding a splash of liquor, mostly concoctions such as Kahlua, or Baileys Irish Creme, or Orange something or other. I had never seen a straight up Whiskey truffle. They come 10 to a box, BUT they are very rich and potent and delicious.<br /><br />Just the right amount of Whiskey aftertaste, creamy on the inside, great quality Butlers chocolate. A smooth dream of a candy, just like my Fiance.

Now these were not my favorites that I have had in liquor chocolates so I gave them a good rating for the transaction being smooth but not perfect because it was not my favorite. Now was this fair of me when to each his own and it was not my favorite? Well I don't know but I have to take back my not so perfect score and revise.<br />THIS ISTHE BEST SELLER I HAVE CAME ACROSS THIS FAR on Amazon AND I LOVE AMAZON. I was on vacation when they called me back about my rating, when we finally got to speak the two people I spoke with were the most pleasant and accommodating people ever, they wanted me to give their product a chance and were very dissatisfied that I was not completely happy. WHAT YOU SAY? NOT THESE DAYS. YOU ARE CORRECT, I WORK FOR A REAL ESTATE LAW FIRM AND I STRIVE TO PLEASE my clients MYSELF, WELL IT IS A DYING QUALITY. I could go on but I will say this. They sent me something different and had me chose and this time it was HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. After being told by someone on here once that they did not want me to buy from them anymore because of a less than perfect rating, I WILL BE ALWAYS BUYING FROM THIS SELLER ANYTIME I'M IN THE MARKET FOR THIS KIND OF CANDY, NEXT TIME I WILL JUST CALL AND TALK TO THEM AND LET THEM SUGGEST FOR ME WHAT TO GET BECAUSE THE COCOLATE FILLED WITH BRANDY WAS/IS ABSOLULTEY AMAZING! Thank you for being this way and it is very much appreciated and I will refer anyone I know and share my candy with where and who to get it from I can promise you that much. BARBIE HADAWAY

review/text: I used to buy this sauce every time I saw it in the store, sometimes 5 or 6 cans at a time, because it wasn't so easy to find. I find the Hunts pasta sauces taste fresher than jarred sauces and are more flavorful too. But over a year ago, they changed the ingredients for the spicy style sauce. It used to be slightly peppery and spicy, but now it tastes like it might make a good base for chili or chili pasta or even a Mexican dish. Not bad, but definitely not an Italian flavored sauce.

review/summary: Colorado Spice Orange Peel, Fine Cut
review/text: It was more then I needed but I'm glad I bought in bulk. This product is as described and saves me the time of removing the pith and cutting the peel myself. I like the flavor the orange adds to my cooking and so do my wife and kids. Thank you for this great time and money saving product.

review/summary: Amazon subscription saves money and cats ecstatic with taste
review/text: My cats think this product is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Luckily they are not gluten free and having to toast the bread.  To me it does not smell as good as Alpo did decades ago, but it doesn't have that strong smell that you get if your cat does not finish its food.  Its portable and does not require a can opener.  I know we are all use to those flip open cat food, but they do not open 100% without the use of a can opener.  This product NEVER requires a can opener.  Its even easy to bring if you are on the go.  In short, its portable and cats love it.  So my pampered felines are really eating it all up which makes every living creature (including me) in my house happy.

review/text: All 3 of my kitties really seem to like this! I had a kitty visitor and she liked it, too. A friend feeds it to her cats and they love it so I decided to give it a try and we are on our second box. Meow Mix may not be one of the better brands but sometimes when kitties are picky and will not eat the premium food you have no choice. It is better for them to eat junk than not eat at all and my kitties really seem to enjoy this food. Fast shipping as always with Amazon!

review/summary: Astronaut Food
review/text: Any of us who grew up during the U.S. space age should use items like this as a way to introduce today's kids to the excitement of the late '60s/early '70s. This is an inexpensive and fun gift (buy several -- they won't go stale! -- including some of this ice cream for yourself to feel young again.)  Last Christmas my 9-year-old niece made a face over the freeze-dried strawberries (they were indeed a bit sour) and seemed to turn her nose up at the chicken-and-rice meal.  I thought my cool idea had been a bust.  This year, however, she reminded me of the astronaut food and requested more.  Score!

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: If you are even a semi-regular baker with recipes that call for candied fruit peel (or you happen to throw candied fruit peels into everything including your morning coffee and thai curry just because they taste good), you have also realized that the baking section in most grocery stores now consists of atrocious "mixes" where you "just add water and bake" or poisonous looking icing tubes. Even if you have the good luck to find a store which actually sells real candied fruit, the prices are more in line with those of Italian truffles. The candied diced lemon peel from Barry Farms is excellent quality, delicious and priced reasonably. I am coming back for more the moment I am done baking with the current box.

review/summary: Very Disappointed
review/text: I ordered two of these and will basically have to throw them away.  I make chocolate truffles with all natural ingredients, and I normally make my own candied lemon peel.  The process is lengthy, however, and I was looking for a small way to save time by ordering this item online.  The problem I found is that the ingredients are far from all natural, and I cannot in good conscience use these on my truffles.  Not to mention the fact that the preservatives in them would taste bad.  I immediately called Barry Farm and asked to return them and they refused to help me in any way -- no returns, no credits for other items, and no compensation whatsoever.  If you are concerned at all that the ingredients are natural, I suppose you have to zoom in on the label (which is illegible otherwise).  This is a lesson learned for me, and I won't be ordering from Barry Farm in the future.  The two 8 oz. containers are still new and sealed tightly together with shrink wrap.  Anyone care to purchase them from me for a bargain???  If you comment on this, I should receive an email.

review/text: I thought I was ordering candied lemon peels that can be eaten on their own. These are horrible for that purpose. I just read another review that said you can bake it into things and put them in coffee. That sounds like a bad idea, but I could be wrong. FYI - it is sweetened with corn syrup. Shipping is expensive because they send it priority, which to me seems like a waste and you have to sign for your package. So, if you miss the mail man, you have to visit the post office.

Would I recommend the flavored stevias? Only if you're not looking for much flavor.

review/text: For several years, I religiously carted bags home in my suitcase purchased at the French grocery store Carrefour in Dubai. Then this particular mix disappeared from the shelves.<br />AT first I thought I had introduced too many colleagues to the "Best Cereal Ever". I only eat this particular cereal and mix it with organic yogurt and fresh fruit. Especially tasty with fresh peaches.<br />After emailing Familia to inquire about the problem, I was pleasantly surprised to receive notification that they had a vendor in the US and I turned to Amazon.<br />I am much happier now that Amazon delivers my cereal to my back door... just in case I am in Dubai when it arrives. Ahhh, the life of an International Flight Attendant!

review/summary: An Excellent and Healthy Choice for Anyone's Diet
review/text: A quality product from Bio-familia, a Swedish company that developed "Bircherm&uuml;esli" a product so popular and successful that made the name Muesli famous all over the world.<br /><br />If you need a high fiber and protein snack option for your diet, this is absolutely a very good product. You can't go wrong and the best of all: excellent taste and quality, and for a pack of five this comes at a good value.<br /><br />Sometimes your diet will require you eat frequently and consciously, and in those cases you need to have a snack at hand when you get hungry, in order to keep your metabolism high all day long. In such cases finding a good and balance option could be hard. I love this 5-pack and I always have one at home an another pack at the office. I try to eat five or more times a day, so in my case having a healthy snack at hand wherever I am when I get hungry is a priority.<br /><br />Since you are checking this product I have to guess that you are probably a person that cares about what you eat, either because you are interested in losing weight, getting in better shape or just be healthier and keep in good shape, so I will share my own experience in the weight loss game and staying in shape game<br /><br />My own successful personal experience in weight loss is based on strategies to boost metabolism. Don't stress yourself, eat frequently, eat just what you need each time, and choose wisely what you are going to eat, supplement your diet. Yet simple and it works. I loss more than 200 lbs and shrink my waist (from 44 to 32), and I have been able to keep in good shape since then. Every single aspect of my life has improved since then.<br /><br />Keep in mind that a good diet is just part of the equation, you also need a plan that helps you keep on track and monitor your condition. Based on my own personal experience I can recommend some tools that you may want to consider, to establish your own strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off. They are:<br /><br />- "Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss" by Mark Hyman. A practical an realistic plan for weigh loss.<br /><br />- "The ABS Diet", which is another very practical, readable, insightful, and inspirational book, that also includes an exercise plan.<br /><br />- A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism).<br /><br />- A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism).<br /><br />- "Heart Monitor Training for the Complete Idiot", a primer on the use of Heart Rate Monitors for health improvement or weight control.<br /><br />If you want to star focusing only on your diet, the first two may be worth considering. If you exercise, or want to start doing it right, the last threee are for you. If you do both, all the recommended options can improve your results.<br /><br />I am 39 years old, With the help of the tools I just mentioned not only I went fro size 44 to size 32 pants, but also obtained substantial benefits that included weight control, cardiovascular improvements, lowered blood pressure, and improved muscular-skeletal strength and flexibility, but also the myriad of mental and psychological benefits derived from being in the best shape of my life.

The first time I thought they had broken apart because while cooking they turn clear from the outside in, so I saw tiny white dots in the boiling water, but once I spooned them out I realized they were there, just invisible.<br /><br />They taste great, but their turning clear surprised me, I guess I am used to the black ones from the drink stands here.  They are fun, and I will try cooking them in colored water to see if I can tint them, that might be kind of interesting.

review/text: By first soaking tapioca in 4 times as much room temperature water as tapioca (overnight for the large pearls and a couple hours for the small ones), then draining off the water and proceeding with your recipe you get tender tapioca in a reasonable amount of cooking time.  Using a lower temperature will eliminate or minimize the problem of the pearls breaking apart.  The white peals are supposed to turn translucent when fully cooked.<br /><br />If you want to end up with black tapioca then you have to start by buying and cooking black tapioca, it's a different product.

review/summary: not quite what i was hoping for
review/text: it took two+ hours to boil and even then some of the tapioca ball were still not cooked all the way through. and if your expecting the black pearls dont get your hopes up, they come out clear. if you have the time and the effort than this will work for you, i just cant see myself spending two plus hours making boba every time i happen get a craving for it.

review/summary: Breaks apart, dissolved in water! Poor quality
review/text: Bought this from one of the sellers here and was fulfilled by Amazon. When soaked, all of the tapioca pearls dissolved into water in mere 10 minutes! When cooked without soaking, they again dissolved and got mixed in with water! The package looks DIFFERENT from the one pictured here. It doesn't have any logos on it but states: Product of Thailand. No expiration date is printed anywhere. Dunno if the quality had anything to do with its use-by date. Can't recommend this to anyone.

review/summary: Great snack for kids
review/text: I needed something to provide for my kid's snack at school (the parents take turns)... I like these because they are packaged two crackers to a pack, so there's not much waste (as long as you recycle the wrappers).  If you give a kid a stack of crackers, they may not eat them all, but here, they will eat the two, and ask for more if they want.  And the price turned out to be equal to buying a big box of crackers that were NOT individually wrapped.  Nice buy.

These really are fantastic for everything - a real treat for company, appetizers, taking to someone's home or picnics. The kids even like them in lunchboxes. Great texture, flavor and shaped for dipping. Better than fried chips of any kind, any day.

review/summary: Just awesome.... totally happy...and convenient to get!
review/text: These are one of the best multi-grain or whole wheat pita chip snacks I've tried.  They are very hearty... hold up well to hummus... and would probably taste just as good with some peanut butter, good old onion dip, chili or other heavy dips.  What I like most, however... is that these are so easy to get on Amazon!!<br /><br />We live in an area that is not known for thinking outside of the bag o chips, so to speak... so when we travel and go into grocery stores, I always look for a brand of whole wheat or grain pita chips to try... and then if they are good, I will see if I can get them on line. These, I found at Publix in FL...I'd researched getting these directly from the company... and after shipping, they were more expensive (though  this might have changed since I looked last).  This qualifies for FREE shipping with Amazon!<br /><br />From Amazon, they arrived when expected... and the box was in perfect shape... no mushed up bags inside!!  The expiration on the bag is in MARCH 09 and at this rate,  I will be ordering by the end of Dec... and I got these mid Nov, I think...so no fear in these getting stale.  My family loves them, too!<br /><br />Will definitely order these wonderful tasting chips again and definitely from Amazon!!

review/summary: Crisp, Crunchy and Delectable
review/text: I bought two boxes of these and have been waiting, waiting, and waiting until the first box finally arrived about thirty minutes ago.  I'd been thinking that I should cancel the delayed second box because I figured they'd be crushed and crumby after traveling for over a week on UPS trucks, as this box had been.  I opened this box, thinking I'd see bags floating around inside, but I was wrong.  I found a perfect Stacy's red box, sealed tight.  When I finally found the expiration date on the product to be 12/07 and today's almost 10/07, I assumed these would be already going stale.  I again thought I'd be better off by calling to cancel the second box.  I opened the box and found inside a dozen perfect bags of chips.  Before calling Amazon, I decided to have some cheese, Byzantine Country Olives and Stacy's Multigrain Pita Chips.  I sliced some cheese onto a plate.  I put some olives next to the cheese.  I cut open a bag of chips, ready to find little bits of chips.  I was wrong.  I placed some nicely shaped chips next to the olives and cheese.  These are absolutely fresh and delicious and I'll be so disappointed if the second box is unable to be delivered.  As much as these chips were just enjoyed, I can't wait to try them with something soft and mushy like hummus, baba ganoush, egg salad or guacamole.  They will be perfect dipped into cottage cheese.  I could pit and chop some of the pounds of olives I have and serve tapenade with these chips.  In other words, these are versatile and healthier than most snack chips on the market.  I hope they return to Amazon stock because these need to be a staple in my household!

I was very happy with the second vase full of flowers and for this I would recommend it but my husband was very unhappy with the fact that on Mother's Day he had to hand me the previous mess that was sent. Try to not take on more orders than you can correctly deliver because that is when the name and quality of your company gets damaged.<br /><br />All in all the final vase that arrived was beautiful and hopefully they will keep true to the picture portrayed.

review/text: After trying lots of different blends in K-Cups over the past couple of years, I've settled on a mix of Tully's French Roast and Newman's Extra Bold as my go-to choices for morning wake up coffees.  Both have a strong, deep flavor that pairs well with weekend waffles and other "sweet" goodies.  It's a shame that the price has gone up so much, but it's not the fault of the coffee.  I'll keep drinking this one -- it's one of my simple pleasures and still much more affordable than picking up a cup at the local espresso stand.

Since I have been buying locally in smaller quantities, I feel I have been dumped upon with old product in this purchase - and will likely toss it. Advice:  buy nearer home and check "use by" dates.  This box comes with loose K-cups inside and no date whatsoever.
