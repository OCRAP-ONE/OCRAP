review/summary: Great product, fast delivery
review/text: I am very passionate about food quality and wary of what I feed my baby.  This is a great basic product that I am using to start my baby on solids.  I like that it is brown rice and that it is fortified.  I have mixed it with breastmilk as well as to thicken food purees.<br /><br />To be honest I have not done a lot of price comparison but I feel that at a little over $3 per 7-oz cans (with subscribe and save I got 6 7-oz cans for $20), there are plenty of frivolous things I have spent $3 on so I think it's worth it to feed my baby a high quality food.<br /><br />I was running low and had forgotten to order a can, but even without expediting shipping, my order came faster than anticipated.  It was shipped via USPS.

review/summary: Perfect First Food for Baby
review/text: I really wanted to find a rice cereal that had more nutritional value than just plain white rice and I am so happy I found this product. I started my baby on this at 5 months and he loves it. I mix it with Breast Milk and once he starts veggies and fruit I will add that in as well. This does not constipate him either and I love that it is Organic and enriched with Probiotcs and DHA.<br />If you are looking for a great first food for your baby with quality ingredients this is it and you can't beat the price for organic.

review/text: We love this oatmeal! The texture is very smooth and my baby loves the taste. We didn't have any problems with any other oatmeal types that we've tried but I was impressed by the DHA + probiotic and that the product is also organic. I also prefer the can over any type in a box, much easier to mix one-handed (which is a must) and much less messy. Great product.

review/summary: Tasty and healthy
review/text: Baby's getting to that solid food stage, so we tried the Dr. Sears recommended HappyBellies line.  Our girl likes their stuff--she's more partial to the rice cereal--and we like that it's organic and (fairly) unadulterated.  Addition of DHA and probiotics a plus.  If you can, try to find a sample portion or individual can for your child before committing to a large, 6-canister purchase, like this one.  Btw, it's tasty enough that Mommy and Papa don't mind getting this cereal in their mouths when cajoling their stubborn baby to eat.

review/summary: Not the best, but okay
review/text: My twins love oatmeal mixed with their food.  I couldn't find organic at our local supermarket so I tried this brand online and they didn't care for the taste (we managed to choke it down with smaller amounts mixed in), but I then found organic gerber which they love!  I can mix the gerber with a little juice and water and they love it.  I would not purchase this brand of oatmeal or cereal again.  The only thing good about it is that it is organic.

review/summary: Poor Quality Product - Recall should be issued!
review/text: After doing a lot of research on single grain oatmeal cereal, it's clear HappyBellies has the best ingredients (DHA from algea as opposed to fish oil and a better blend of probiotics as opposed to just one type). However, there definitely is some sort of production problem with the cans of oatmeal with a July 2012 expiration date.<br /><br />First, there is a distinct smell with this oatmeal. This oatmeal has a strong stale smell and looks grey in color. All other oatmeals have almost no smell at all and have a consistent light-khaki color.<br /><br />Second, the HappyBellies oatmeal does not thicken formula as other oatmeals do. Our son has acid reflux and we were told to add one tablespoon of oatmeal per ounce of formula. When I use Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, this makes the formula very thick - sludgelike. With the HappyBellies, no matter how much I add it doesn't thicken the formula at all. It remains watery and not suitable for a baby who spits up excessively.<br /><br />Third, I think our son has an allergic reaction to this oatmeal. He has no issue using the non-organic Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, but with the HappyBellies he has thrown up the formula/oatmeal immediately after eating it as if his stomach was upset. He also seemed to break out in a rash after putting him on HappyBellies after a couple of days.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviews that there definitely seems to be something wrong with this batch of oatmeal. I suspect that moisture somehow go into the oatmeal before it was sealed and as a result it rotted in the can, thus causing a bad smell, a grey color, and unable to absorb the moisture from the formula to thicken the solution. The grey color has even made me wonder if it's mold that has grown on the oatmeal.<br /><br />It's very clear to me that HappyBellies should issue a voluntary recall of this product!

review/summary: Read the Amazing List of Ingredients!
review/text: I showed this to my son's pediatrician and he was impressed with (and supported!) the list of items added to the cereal!<br /><br />This was the first solids I added to my child's bottle when we started to transition away from milk only. The cereal is really finely milled and melts away easily into the liquid. At first I was worried that it would thicken up too much that it would clog the milk from flowing through, but happy to report it did not happen. I usually add one tablespoon of cereal to 6oz of milk. I noticed that once I started to do that, the bottle will sustain my son for longer periods of time especially at night. Now, I use this with every bottle of milk I make for him. Sometimes I also use this to thicken some of the fruits or veggie puree that are too watery. This makes the puree thicker and easier for baby to eat from the spoon. When the puree is too thin, it will dribble out of baby's mouth easily - after all they are just starting to get the hang of gumming,tasting and swallowing something this is not completely liquid.<br /><br />Amazon prices are much cheaper ($19.29 for pack of 6 or $3.22 per canister) compared to what the local Whole Foods would charge(about $5 including tax for ONE). I hesitated for a moment since this is after all SIX canisters, but after looking at how much I use this on a daily basis, I am sure we will deplete this in no time!

review/text: We feed this to our twins. They've been on it a couple of months. I notice they seem less gassy using this cereal too. We've tried both the oatmeal and the rice and the kids like both of them. Sometimes we mix half with Earth's Best cereal to make it last longer. EDIT: It's been a few months since the original post. My kids are 10 months. They now prefer this to Earth's Best cereal. They'll eat them mixed together, but they won't eat the other by itself. Admittedly, Happy Bellies smells more appetizing to me too. Not that the other smells bad.  But this smells more tasty.

review/text: We fed our youngest all three of the HappyBellies - starting with the Brown Rice then MultiGrain and ended with the Oatmeal which I think was her favorite. I love the DHA & probiotics. And that it is organic - which no one else made. This cereal is great because you add your own liquid - she liked apple juice with it - and we didn't even heat it up. She liked it cold. As she got older I would mash up some bananas it in too.

review/text: I love this oatmeal. My baby had dairy allergies so that I had to eliminate all milk products from my diet while I was nursing him. He would have really bad diarheaa whenever I had anything that had even a small amount of milk in it. Shortly after I started feeding this cereal to him, he stopped having that adverse reaction to milk. He has also been very healthy. He's almost 1.5 now and has only been sick once.  Now if only it would do something for his teething.. lol.

review/summary: Mixes well, versatile and not glue-like~
review/text: I am very happy with this cereal. I am confident feeding it to my infant because it's organic and it has probiotics. My son needed to be on a powder probiotic supplement that was VERY expensive. It's nice to make the transition and have it included in his food at this price point.<br /><br />When I first tried the cereal, I made a small amount (1 tsp cereal and 4 tsp breast milk) and made it runny (easy to do, as there is nothing glue-like about this cereal). He wasn't too fond of the experience - but that's not a reflection on this product at all. He's 5 months old now so I mix 1 tablespoon of the powder with 1 oz of breast milk and drop in one cube of frozen veggies (I make my own food and freeze it in ice cube trays). I heat it all up, mix it well and he's in HEAVEN! He prefers carrots & cereal, and butternut squash & cereal... and his favorite is bananas & rice cereal. I've tasted them all and while it's more bland than I had imagined, it's tasty. It's not sweet, just like a mellow oatmeal. This cereal also retains it's consistency throughout the feeding and also holds onto its warmth - which is great for a son like mine who will only eat warm/hot food!<br /><br />Also, there's been no constipation/diarrhea side effects like most first foods will have on your baby - a welcomed relief!

(There are conflicting studies on this, but I figured it can't hurt.)  There is some controversy about Martek's DHA in organic products.  But overall it's a great cereal.  My son does well with it.  I only gave 4 stars because it's not the greatest value out there.

It could be a totally random issue.<br /><br />I am not personally a big fan of artificial sources of DHA, such as algae.  For mothers who are breastfeeding, breast milk is the best source of DHA and benefits of external sources of DHA are disputed.  However, we do like the fact that cereal has probiotics.<br /><br />We recommend this cereal to parents who are looking for a healthy organic option.

review/summary: She loves her Happy Bellies oatmeal
review/text: Our 7 month old was exclusively breastfed until 6 months when we started slowly introducing solids.  Her food is about 50% homemade purees and 50% jarred/pouched baby food (Earth's Best, Happy Babies, and Plum Organics).  We tried sweet potato as her first food but it didn't go over well, so we decided to try something bland and smooth but didn't want to give her a processed white rice cereal.  We picked up the Happy Bellies oatmeal and it was a hit!  Now when introducing a new food I'll mix up a bit of the oatmeal and blend it with the fruit or veggie puree to help her adjust to the new flavor.<br /><br />Plum Organics has an oatmeal that also has probiotics and my parents have purchased it to keep at their house (we go for dinner once a week). I much prefer the packaging, texture, and ease of mixing/smoothness of the Happy Bellies oatmeal.  Happy Bellies also has DHA, which Plum Organics does not.

review/text: My first can of Happybellies oatmeal was cream-colored and odorless, my second can was greenish-brown and smelled rancid (I immediately threw it out), and the third can was also greenish-brown in color but smelled a little less rancid.  Serious quality issues considering the high price and brand image.  I don't recommend this oatmeal until they acknowledge and resolve this issue.

review/summary: If you have gotten a bad can, read this!
review/text: I contacted Happy Bellies after purchasing what appeared to be a bad can at my local target. They responded within one business day. Below is an excerpt of their response to me. I thought other parents would appreciate this information.<br /><br />"I can tell you that this is a wholly organic, minimally processed product, and as such, it's subject to slight changes in the organic crop year, season, etc.  Also, since this is drum dried (thin film on a hot steel rolling dryer), changes in drum temp can occasionally cause more browning than normal.  Also, this product (BELLIES cereal) is on what's called a "positive release" program, which means that product cannot be released for sale until the required testing comes back acceptable.  The fact that it was for sale tells me it passed those tests...<br />Right now, I feel as though rough handling (trucks, forklifts, shelf stockers, etc.) has caused damage, most likely leading to a seam leak.  Since we flush the can with nitrogen, a seam leak allows air (oxygen) into the can, which can cause a set of oxidation reactions.  These are responsible for off flavours/colours/odours, but other than that, are harmless, and do not pose a food safety threat to your son."<br /><br />I believe in this product and their commitment to customers. Hopefully they will resolve these issues soon, but knowing that the product is safe is most important to me--even if the color is off.

review/summary: Be careful! May be dangerous.
review/text: I bought one of the oatmeal from wholefood and fed it to my baby right away. I was happy about it because she loved it. But after a couple of weeks, one day when my Mom fixed the cereal, she asked me why it has the bad smell. I smelled it, and it does(it's not very strong but does has the smell like when all the nuts or rice turn bad)! I smelled the "Earth's best" one I have and it smells pefectly normal. Then I remembered I got a Happy Bellies multi-grain cereal before from [...]. It had not been opened and expires on March 2010. I opened it right away and it has a VERY strong bad smell. It makes me sick for several minutes and feel like there will be something fly out of it! I was really scared! You'd better be careful too since baby won't taste it and you may not find it before it's really bad! I feel so sorry for my baby since I know it's really bad to her health, much worse then giving her non-organic cereal. I won't ever buy the product again no matter how my baby likes it. It makes me really upset and I want to give it negative 5 starts if I could.<br />BTW, I submitted this reviw to [...] but they didn't publish it. I just hope everyone smell the oat before you give it to your baby.

review/summary: Thought the grayish color was normal...
review/text: I've been buying Happy Bellies for the past 6 months (though I didn't use it exclusively... I also tried other brands). I'd say I've bought probably 5 or 6 cans so far. Unlike most of the reviewers here who opened a seemingly bad can, most of my cans have been grayish/greenish color! I thought it was a bit weird that the color/consistency/smell is different from the other brands, but since the "quality" I got has been consistent (consistently bad...), I didn't think too much of it. And then one day I finally got one that looks "normal"... I did some search on the internet and realized that I've been giving my baby bad oatmeal!!!! I feel so bad. I hope the company does something about it, and that FDA investigates on this issue. Has anyone reported this yet?

review/summary: Yep, They Changed the Formula...
review/text: This cereal has changed for the gross.  I didn't buy my latest can on Amaon, rather Target, so it's obviously a Happy Bellies issue & not Amazon.  The color of the cereal is a nasty grey/green and it smells awful.  I was wondering why my babies weren't really that enthusiastic about eating.  I like the added DHA & probiotics, but looks like I'll be going back to Earth's Best Oatmeal cereal.  Another company trying to skimp out on high quality ingredients, just to make a quick buck.

review/text: I ordered a whole box of 6 cans of the cereal. When I opened the first  one,  only a little more than half of the can is filled with the cereal. Well, I thought I got a lemon. I opened another can, surprise, the similar half full amount. It turned out all 6 cans were just like that. Why would they use such a big can when they only fill half of it?  Although I like the ingredient, I will never buy the brand again. It's not the way to do a honest business. So I am not going to trust its listed nutrition.

review/summary: Buyer beware
review/text: We used to love this product feeding it to our son twice a day for several months.  About 3 months ago, we opened a can and there was definitely something wrong with it.  The consistency was clumpy instead of the normal light, fluffy flakes.  The color was off as well.  The most notable change was the terrible smell.  I did contact the company and they responded to me right away.  The answer made some sense and it has been quoted by others here in this forum.  My problem now is that it just makes no sense!  How on earth is there no recall or some other investigation of this product by the FDA?  It was very noticeable that it all but disappeared off of store shelves and online stores for a few weeks.  The price here on Amazon has gone way up.  I was still buying it but will no longer.  I was still opening cans that were rancid and others that are not.  It is not cheap so I can't afford to keep playing the guessing game on my dime.

review/summary: Super Cereal!
review/text: Our son loves this cereal! I've compared and tried many brands, but I think this one gives us the most bang for our buck nutrition-wise. We started with the HappyBellies Rice about a year ago, and then graduated to the Multigrain as soon as the munchkin was eating more solid foods. Now, at 16 months, he's eating a thicker version mixed with fruits, veggies, yogurt, or even a protein; he likes it so much that I can basically get him to try anything that's mixed into his cereal.<br /><br />The easy-on-the-system nature and probiotics have been especially helpful when our son's been ill and had diarrhea due to a nasty virus and teething.<br /><br />Because this formula is more "concentrated" nutritionally than many other organic cereals, I think it's a good value, and it's certainly easier to take smaller servings (e.g. 3 Tablespoons vs. 5 for other brands) on the road. The cans pack and travel well, too.<br /><br />Overall, I'm sticking with this cereal because it seems to fill my hungry kid up, provide very good nutrition and is super easy to mix with stuff, even though he could technically eat adult oatmeal or whatever.

review/text: I found this product at my local Whole Foods for significantly less, which is shocking considering Whole Foods isn't exactly known for low prices - and I purchased in bulk on Amazon so the per unit price definitely should have been better.  Also, infant cereal is supposed to be 1/4 cup of dry cereal to 2 oz. of liquid, which is what it says on this container, but the cereal is way too thick when you make it like that.  The instructions say that 1/4 cup is 14 grams of cereal, which is not true; I weighed it myself and came up with about double that in grams.  So I have no idea whether the nutrition facts apply to the 14g or the 1/4 cup.  My daughter seems to like the cereal, though she definitely prefers the multigrain and oatmeal from this brand.

review/text: I purchased 3 containers of this cereal all having expiration dates in 2012.  The first container I opened seemed fine (at least I hope it is! I fed it to my 5 month old!) The cereal color was a pale whitish-tan and there was relatively no odor to it.  Baby likes it so I am happy.  The second container I opened (again, same packaging, and good expiration date) had a totally different color - this time it was brownish-green. However, the worst part was the rancid smell.  It smells like rancid oil.  I opened the third container - same brownish-green color and and same rancid smell.  Very unhappy with this product.  I have contacted the company, but have had no reply yet.  I would not recommend feeding this to your baby.

review/summary: Rancid Smell and Taste
review/text: I purchased this cereal because it appeared to be very healthy and promising. But once I received it and after smelling and tasting it i knew something was wrong. I know a rancid smell when i smell it. I would not feed this to my baby. I tasted and it left a terrible after taste. I called the company and read other reviews on this defect. The company says since there is less fat in this specific product, a smell has resulted but it does not affect the overall product and is safe to eat. I was sent another container but this had the same smell, so I would conclude that the recently made containers are all like this. The expiration date was in 2013. Sorry, but anything that smells like this I would never give to my baby. However the oat and rice cereals do not have a rancid smell and I give those to my baby every day and do not see a problem with them. I still need to research more into the extraction method of DHA which may also have something to do with the smell.

review/text: I do like this better than the Earth's Best Oatmeal cereal (made my baby constipated). However, I will not continue to buy this product. THIS IS COMPLETELY MY FAULT FOR NOT DOING MORE RESEARCH. The company claims that none of the DHA used in their products was produced using the "hexane method". However, the company that produces Life's DHA, claims that they only use the hexane method, because it is the only FDA approved method. I tried questioning both Happybaby, as well as Martek (makes Life's DHA), but didn't get a response from either company. If you are wondering what's so bad about Life's DHA, and the Hexane method... Google: Hexane method Life's DHA.<br /><br />I have the grain blender for my Vitamix, so I will make my daughter's cereal that way from now on.

review/text: I recently started my 18-month old son on this cereal and both he and I are very happy with it - I wish I had found it sooner! It is gluten free and provides 60% of his required iron (as well as a lot of other things he needs to grow well). He likes the taste and it mixes easily.<br /><br />My only complaint has less to do with the product itself than the packaging; the cans are only 3/4 full, which is a blatant and shameful waste on the part of the manufacturer.

review/summary: It doesn't get spat back out!
review/text: My daughter has a tendency to be a picky eater.  I am not sure where this came from b/c other kids are not.  But this product, she doesn't seem to 'reverse eat' as we like to call it.  But the product itself is very pricey for the amount that you get (7oz vs 16 ozreg for same price).  But,all in all, the ingredients are good for my little one. We take probiotics, DHA, and eat brown rice, so why would we feed her differently?

review/text: We love this cereal and the fact that it has probiotics.  I am not a big fan of the DHA from external sources such as algae, because it is not the same as the DHA found in breast milk.  However, the cereal is good and our baby likes it.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone looking for good organic cereal.

review/summary: Great product, reasonable price
review/text: We only fed our son rice cereal for about 2 weeks - he vastly prefers the taste of oats. This cereal mixes instantly, and combines well with other foods. The addition of DHA and probiotic supplements is an important factor in our decision to buy this product.<br /><br />It was a little disconcerting to open the cannister for the first time and see that it had settled to the point that it appeared only half full. The label says this may happen...it's a shame that so much packaging is wasted, though.<br /><br />Tip: We saved the scoop from his formula and use it to measure the cereal from the cannister.

review/summary: My son loves this cereal!
review/text: No joke--this was the first solid food we gave our son and he went "hmm hmm" (yum yum). We now give this to him one or two times a day (he is 7 months now) and often mix it with apples, or pear, or other foods too.  He really enjoys this and I like that it has probiotics. It does seem like a large amount of creal in one order, esp if you aren't sure if your child will like it. But if you plan to feed cereal to your baby while supplementing with other solid foods, I would say this is one of the best rice cereals available.

review/text: This is a fantastic cereal for babies.  Probiotics are needed by babies and will help them to avoid thrush which is common in infants, especially if they or their nursing mom has been on antibiotics.  Baby's bodies have the right balance of probiotics and will have less problems with thrush!  YEA!  The enzymes and probiotics are perfect for babies and a good idea!  Finally!

review/summary: My baby girl loves this!
review/text: My wife and I tried so many different types of cereal, and every time my daughter would give us this "what in the world is this stuff" face. She would then not eat no matter how hard we tried. Our friend recommended this rice cereal, and we have never looked back. My daughter loves this, and gets it three times a day. We love it because not only is it organic, but it has other vitamins and nutrients vital to the development of any child. Whats even better is that with this pack of 6 we are able to have plenty and not have to worry for weeks, and the subscription makes it even cheaper than if you were to buy it in any retail store.

review/summary: Our son loves this stuff
review/text: My son loves this stuff.  He likes it by itself or when it's mixed with fruits.  We were initially drawn to it at one of the local big box stores because it is multigrain and has DHA and probiotics.  Compared to plain old rice cereal I think this has been a much better choice.  After finding out that our son loves it we started getting it from Amazon and have put it on subscribe and save.  Our little guy is 11 months now and goes through the 6 pack in about a month.  Great product and a better price then we've been able to find locally (plus the convenience of getting it delivered).

review/summary: Sad that sugar is added unlike the rice or oatmeal HAPPYBELLIES
review/text: My son LOVES HappyBellies Oatmeal, so I tried the Multigrain and he loved it, too. So did I, until I read the ingredients and noticed that they added glucose to make the cereal sweet. No extra sugar for my darling. Back to the oatmeal version for us since it's naturally sweet. As he's now 10 months old, I'm exposing him to other grains, like quinoa (which is in the multigrain)and complementing his daily grains with the HB oatmeal to get all those good vitamins and probiotics and DHA.

review/summary: Pre and Probiotics Make the Difference!
review/text: I was searching for an organic baby cereal to give to my 2nd daughter because I had not been happy with what I had fed my 1st.  I am not saying that Earth's Best *caused* my daughter's PN allergy, but I was very disillusioned with them, having called and asked about cross contamination and having them dismiss my concerns (now, surprise surprise, everything is labeled for cross-contamination, as it should have been before!).  At any rate, my 1st had eczema and other issues, and although breast fed exclusively for 6 months (and for another 7 thereafter),did not stay on the cereal as long as she could have because of these issues.  So, when it came time to feed my 2nd, I was so happy to find HAPPYBELLIES!  I absolutely LOVE the added pre and probiotics, and think they make all of the difference in the world.  It is so nice to have this included in the cereal, without having to worry about supplementation.  Already at risk for food allergies because of her sister, I feel confident that this has helped boost her developing digestive and immune systems.  And ... so far so good ... she is allergy free! Great for mixing with HAPPYBABY fresh frozen or pouches, I cannot stop raving about this cereal (and continue do so any opportunity I get!!)

review/text: I baught this kind of cereal from Wholefood. Since this was the first time I tried this brand, I picked 3 kinds: multi-grain, oatmeal and brown rice. Oatmeal was all right, but the other two smelled like they were already stale(the expiration day is May 2013), and they tasted bad too and sticked on my throat when I tried them. My baby cried and refused to eat them. The customer service of Wholefood was very nice and refunded me. I don't think I will buy this brand of cereal again.

review/text: I bought this because I was looking for something with probiotics.  I have purchased a similar product from Plum Organics (contained Pro and prebiotics).  I have purchased several items from HappyBellies before and have been pleased with them all.  I ordered this despite the reviews from others that commented on the rancid smell.  I assume this has to do with the added DHA.  I bought 6 containers.  Opened all 6 and they ALL smelled rancid.  I would never feed this to my child.  Ended up contacting Amazon because there was no return available for this product.  Save yourself the hassle.  Buy Plum Organics Multi grain cereal.

review/summary: Great for milk/soy allergy babies
review/text: My baby is allergic to cow's milk and the doctor said he is likely allergic to soy.  I was feeding him Gerber cereal and didn't realize it had soy content.  Luckily my son was okay...just getting really chunky from the cereal in general.  So I bought this because it is completely dairy and soy free...and since it's organic and brown rice, much healthier for him.<br /><br />This stuff actually smells like rice, not processed shiny flakes.  My son also loves it.  He even makes an "mmmm" sound when I feed it to him.<br /><br />I left out the last star because it's a bit expensive compared to other cereals...  But as they say, you get what you pay for.

review/text: This is the first oatmeal cereal my 6 month old has been given and he really LOVES it. I drove my self crazy doing all kinds of research for a safe, BPA free cereal, then drove myself crazy looking at all the research on DHA, and so on. Finally I decided to go ahead and give this a try. Unfortunately there is no perfect baby cereal on the market at this time, but this product is pretty close. And my baby seems to really enjoy it. I will say my local target is currently selling it for only $3.19 a can, which is a little cheaper than amazons current price.

review/summary: Rancid / Acrid Smell
review/text: Our baby has been eating the oatmeal cereal for about five months now. Just opened up a recent case from Amazon and the first two cans out are definately different than what this product has been in the past. It is not white in color, but green/gray, it is also not as 'fluffy'. The rancid / acrid smell is definately present. It smells like a two year old can of holiday nuts that went stale long ago. I am somewhat shocked at the number of reviews and comments that have had a similar issue. The Manufacturer does not list a phone number on their website and e-mail is the only contact method. I got an auto-response e-mail with a 718 number that is no longer in service.....not inspiring much confidence in this brand.

review/summary: practically digesting itself
review/text: The probiotics helps my baby's gassiness. However, my 8 month old likes her food thick. No matter how much rice cereal I added, the food practically digests itself (very quickly at that too) before my baby even has a couple spoons of it. Don't understand why it has to contain amylase enzyme. I have let it stand and literally watch it thins itself out, without my baby ever touching the food. I typically added a couple ounces of homemade organic vege with an ounce of breastmilk plus the Earth Best oat and rice together with Happy Bellies, hoping to keep it thick a little longer, but to no avail. I am writing this review because I just threw out another bowl of food because my baby refuses to eat it after a couple spoons since it literally just became soup despite I made it *thick*.

Once i could not find the HappyBellies rice cereal at the store and got the Earth Best instead. The baby didn't like it and it was hard to feed through the bottle<br /><br />The only problem i have is what's up with the 3/4 of the container? Why it is not as full as it's used to be? Keeping static price in expense of the quantity i guess? oh well...economy it is

Even though, the tins were originally sealed and expiry date is in 2012!<br /><br />Is there a production problem for the cereals? Perhaps amazon.com should do a sample check!<br /><br />This is a serious problem and should be investigated immediately as the cereals are meant for our dear babies!

review/summary: multigrain version does not appeal to either of my twins
review/text: My now 1 yr old babies love the rice and oatmeal versions of this cereal, but hate the multigrain version.  Pity that I tried it out<br />as an amzn multipack, guess it will go into my second harvest bin.  Like other reviewers mentioned, it has a slightly stale<br />smell to it -- perhaps they don't wash the quinoa enough before processing it?  I taste everything my babies eat, and have<br />to mention that it does not have the melt in the mouth texture of the other two besides not tasting good.  My babies will eat quinoa for eg<br />when I cook it for family meals.  And amaranth in flakes from their brother's cereals.  Buy a single can from whole foods<br />or target etc before buying a multi pack.  They won't even eat it if I put in one tablespoon to 5 of rice cereal.  Ended up just tossing the open can.<br />Either of these is fantastic. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YSTGGW">HAPPYBELLIES Brown Rice Cereal Contains DHA and Probiotics, Organic, 7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YSS7EO">HAPPYBELLIES Oatmeal Cereal, Organic, Contains DHA and Probiotics, 7-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: My son has eaten cereal since he was 3 months old. He ABSOLUTELY LOVES this cereal. Its consistency is grainy, not mushy like most cereals. When I've tried to give him other cereals he can TELL the difference. This also promotes a healthy GI tract, which is great for my son because he get constipated from time to time.
