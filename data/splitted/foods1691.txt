review/text: The taste is fine on these granola bars, but they were so hard I had a sore jaw after eating each one. I suggest buying one box at your local store before buying the pack of 6. The chocolate chips are on top and don't really stick to the granola so careful when you open the package.

review/summary: Does the Job
review/text: Edward & Sons Not-Chick'n Bouillon Cubes provide chicken flavoring for vegetarians and vegans who do not want the "real" thing.  The flavor is excellent.  My only complaint is that the sodium content is pretty high.  I have learned to not use any other product that has salt in it when using the bouillon cubes.  Interestingly, the fat used in this product has the same texture of chicken fat.  Fortunately, the fat content is not high.<br /><br />Pretty dull review but it is rather hard to wax poetic about bouillon cubes.

review/text: Finally, a vegan bouillon stock that I can actually enjoy.  I add this to the water when I am making quinoa or rice, and the flavor is outstanding - it really does taste like chicken!  I wouldn't want to drink a lot of the broth, since it does have 1600mg sodium per cube.  However, when making soup/stew/quinoa/rice, this product can't be beat.  It contains no MSG and is gluten-free!

review/summary: My favorite boullion cubes without the MSG
review/text: These boullion cubes are soft and tasty.  They have a great taste and the cubes are also soft so that I don't have to sit there and try to break up a brick in a pot of water.<br /><br />I know the other cubes are cheaper but they are hard as a rock and have MSG.  For migraine sufferers triggered by MSG, Not-Chick'n is a great alternative.<br /><br />-- Update --<br /><br />Usually I am good at reading ingredients, but a friend pointed out that these cubes use 2 types of sugar:  evaporated cane juice and maltodextrin along with organic expeller pressed palm oil and garlic.  I was fine with this considering that the boullions do not have MSG, but I know some people cannot have sugar, garlic or palm oil.

review/summary: great for flavoring rice
review/text: I eat a good deal of brown rice because it is filling but it is also a tad boring.  It doesn't have much flavor.  This bullion provides a great way to flavor rice in a very simple way.  Simply place a half to full cube when cooking rice for a rice that is still filling but of a different flavor.  I like to pair my "chicken" flavored rice with sauteed greens and a vegetarian BBQ riblet (Moringstar Farms and Gardenburger sell a similar product).  I can't wait to try to make a vegetarian chicken noodle soup with this product.  The Edward & Sons website also has a lot of unique recipes so don't feel you would be limited to just soups or flavored pilafs.

review/summary: Vegan Flavoring for Soup and Other Dishes
review/text: This is the best vegan "chicken" flavored bouillon cube I have found for use in soups and for flavoring other dishes, like rice and homemade bean-based veggie burgers. I have tried other brands of similar products but this one has the best flavor and, unlike some, doesn't contain soy. It is salty so if you are using it in a recipe calling for salt I would definitely recommend reducing or omitting the salt. My favorite way to use this is in my split pea soup (posted on The Vegan Kitchen blog). In combination with the other ingredients it really gives the soup that perfect "split pea" flavor! I've also used this in homemade veggie burgers with kidney beans and rice. For that use, I recommend adding the cube to the rice while it cooks. These don't dissolve as readily as I would have expected so I would advise taking a bit of the water your recipe calls for and heating it in a small container where you can stir the cube(s) until completely dissolved, then add it to the recipe. You won't find it for cheaper than Amazon subscribe-and-save but pay attention to your shipment dates because one case of this goes a long way!

review/summary: Delicious and easy to use - but lose the palm oil, please!
review/text: The title says it all. Edward & Sons's vegan chicken bouillon cubes are both super-tasty and incredibly convenient. They dissolve quickly in water and don't make a mess, unlike some other vegan bouillons/bases I've tried. For example, the Rapunzel brand bouillon - available only in vegetable flavor -  is slower to dissolve, and the Better Than Bouillon line - which comes in small jars - is kind of messy and requires refrigeration after opening. (However, I have found that the cubes get a little sticky in hot and/or humid conditions, so you may want to store them in the fridge in the summer.)  Use it to make vegan chicken noodle soup, vegan sausage gravy, you name it. (Vegans only eat lettuce and granola? Lies!)<br /><br />On the downside, Edward & Sons Not-Chick'n Bouillon does contain palm oil (as does the Rapunzel brand; Better Than Bouillon does not). Palm oil, of course, has been linked to deforestation, habitat loss (such as that of Orangutans and Sumatran Tigers), the oppression of indigenous peoples, and greenhouse gas emissions. I contacted the company to inquire about their sourcing of palm oil, but did not receive a satisfactory answer. (The representative simply stressed that they use palm fruit oil, not palm kernel oil, and then elaborated on the health benefits of doing so.)  Please consider switching to another plant oil, 'kay guys?

This is a flavor unlike any asian bistro cooking, and yet, it's so-oooooooooooo so, so good.<br /><br />I must admit that I have often wanted to find other flavors that were just as tasty and spicy and have only found 1 that is nearly as tasty but it's not a similar sweet-n-hot-savory, it's got heat but it's very different.

review/summary: the most "straightforward" of the Earl Grey K-Cup varieties
review/text: This is my favorite of the currently (1/2007) available K-Cup Earl Grey teas.  To calibrate this review to your tastes: (1) I like *tea*, plus this one flavoring, not herbs with a little bit of tea -- I'm even finicky about how much Bergamot gets put in.  (2) I prefer Twinings to Stash (in bags, not available in K-Cups) for that very reason.  Twinings is sightly less expensive than Gloria Jean's or Celestial Seasonings, and has the "cleanest" taste of the three.  If you like a "brighter" or more flowery taste, go for the Celestial Seasonings; or if you like a more "complex" or "spicy" taste, choose the Gloria Jean's.

review/summary: Week flavor and leaves tea "powder" in the cup.
review/text: I really enjoy tea, and especially Earl Grey. I do not drink coffee, soda or anything else other then tea and water. So I find myself drinking lots of tea.<br /><br />When I purchased my Keurig, I also bought a selection of teas from Celestial Seasonings, which included their Earl Grey and English Breakfast. After using them up, I decided to try the Earl Grey from Twinings for K-cups but was disappointed. The flavor was quite weak, not to say everyone likes a strong tea, but those who enjoy the sophisticated taste of Earl Grey, often like it to have a bolder taste then what this produced. Also it left a lot of unpleasant tea powder at the bottom of the tea cup which gave the cup of tea an unappealing appearance of being dirty.<br /><br />I would have just assumed that this was the best a Keurig maker could do to produce a cup of tea if I hadn't already had 2 boxes of Celestial Seasoning teas that produced stronger tea with no muddy appearance. I was quite surprised with this result because I ordered the Twinings tea with the assumption that it would be better then the Celestial Seasoning.<br /><br />Not my favorite K-cup tea for the Keurig.

review/summary: A Good Cup of Tea
review/text: Twinings Earl Grey is my favorite tea, and I drink it almost daily.  I've tried Bigelow, Harrods, etc. and I like Twinings best, either loose or in bags, so I know exactly what this tea is supposed to taste like.  I was a bit concerned that the K-cups would disappoint, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I tried the 3 smallest brew sizes before I found a trick that works for me.  I double-brew one K-cup on the smallest setting.  By this I mean that I run the water through 1 K-cup twice, both times on the smallest size which makes a large cup that for me is about the right strength and flavor.  When you factor in the convenience and speed of using the Keurig, this makes getting a good cup of tea a breeze.

review/summary: Great Earl Grey, Now Available for Your Keurig Brewer!
review/text: Earl Grey has been one of my favorite teas since the first time I tried it (roughly 2 years ago).  I like the taste of bergamot, though I can understand how some might find it strange or overpowering.  This product was, to me and contrary to the opinion of others, just right in terms of strength.  I always use the lowest water setting on my brewer and am able to clearly taste the tea with no trouble and without feeling as though it should be diluted.  Of course, I should clarify that I drink my tea like my coffee (that is black with no sugar).  As a result, the tea may be too dilute when mixed with milk, but I can't say I've tried it that way.  I also haven't found it to leave "tea dust" behind, like another reviewer claimed, but that could be due to luck on my part or bad luck on that person's.  If you're looking for a delicious earl grey tea for your Keurig brewer, look no further.

review/text: This tea tastes good, but it is very finely ground and some of that ends up in the cup.  I like to use the same tea k-cup 2-3 times to make iced tea and with Twinnigs it doesn't work because there is so little tea in the k-cup (I suppose that's why it is so finely ground - so they can use less) that it ends up too dilute.  With Timothy's Earl Grey, on the other hand, there is much more tea in the k-cup which allows for my reuse of 2-3 times and the grounds don't end up in the cup.  The taste is about the same except you get more for your money with Timothys.

So it was a great surprise to find that the Twinings K-cups were so delicious.  Using the K-cups is also a time-saver, obviously.  Only down side is the environmental impact of all those plastic cups.  I'm hoping they come up with a solution to that soon.

review/summary: The Step Between the Bags & Captain Picard's Way
review/text: I've tried this tea by the bag and it does tend to be milder than your average supermarket Tetley or Lipton. But I've been drinking Bigelow Green Tea that way for about a year and I wanted to revisit Earl Grey via a Keurig-clone machine I got for my birthday over the summer. After I went through a couple of "variety packs" I picked up an Ekobrew Refillable basket and started drinking expresso done that way for my morning coffee. I admit, using a Keurig machine is still a bit low tech compared to just asking for "Earl Grey, hot" in my best Patrick Stewart imitation (which isn't very good) but give Mr. Coffee 10-20 years and they'll come up with a voice-activated machine. After all, if I'd wanted to pay another c-note per month, the car I've been leasing since last year could have come with that technology.

review/text: I have been a tea drinker all of my life. When I bought my Keurig coffee maker I was delighted to learn that I could make tea also. At the time I needed to drink only Decaf and after trying a few different brands which are hard to find I ordered Twinings Decaf tea and was so happy to taste such a good cup of tea. It tasted so similar to the regular Twinings tea that you wouldn't it was decaf. I am a satisfied customer

review/summary: Right Box, Wrong Tea
review/text: I really love this tea, it's my favorite. I like the mildly sweet flavor, and it is a medium strength tea, not too weak and not too strong. I haven't tried the caffeinated version yet, but I hope to in the future. Unfortunately I have to rate this 4 stars as one of the boxes I received was filled with English Breakfast Tea instead of Earl Grey. This was probably a packing issue with the manufacturer as the box was correct (Twinings Earl Grey). I received a refund, but it was still inconvenient and I hope it doesn't happen again.

review/summary: Not my favorite k-cup Earl Grey
review/text: I like Earl Grey...at least I THINK I do as I have always enjoyed the Bergamot orange flavor/aroma of it. This product, however, leans too far in the direction of lemon for me...not enough orange (I like the combination of both.) I don't know if it is simply too much Bergamot for my taste, not enough black tea, or the k-cup is the wrong vehicle for this brand. Then again, maybe it IS the way it is supposed to taste and I have just been acclimated to other brands. I don't use sugar or honey, so it isn't that.<br /><br />Either way, I like the Bigelow brand better(or even the Celestial Seasonings which is further toward the orange side, not exactly Earl Grey-y, but still good.) Twinnings is a fine name in teas, but this particular product isn't MY preference.

review/text: My wife loves this tea. I tried a cup and I like it too, even though I'm a coffee drinker.<br /><br />The problem is, 5 out of every 6 K-Cups we've used have split open and spread the ground-up tea all over the place. It takes the fun out of having this type of coffee/tea maker if you have to clean it after every cup.<br /><br />We've bought these before, from a different source, and didn't have this problem. We're hoping this was just a bad batch. At any rate, if you buy these, be aware that you may have many cleanups in your future.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because the tea itself is so good.

My cat likes it so much that he insists on a jar of it to start each day.<br /><br />More expensive than "cat food", it beats the heck out of having to deal with kitty vomit!  Since Gerber doesn't vitaminize its foods for cats, I add 50-100mg of Taurine to every plate.<br /><br />Amazon's prices are the best!

Now I am hooked and will probably order a bunch of it. In fact, I sure hope I'll never have a child, because s/he isn't going to be left with any food. I am eating it all!

review/summary: Reliable product, easy way to purchase
review/text: What can you say about baby food?  The ingredients are green beans and water.  But if you've tried buying baby food in any quantity in the grocery store, you know how the jars roll all over the place and are a pain to transport home.  Buying online, and through Subscribe and Save with free shipping, not only makes this product less expensive than buying at the grocery store, but far more convenient.

review/summary: You Ladies Don't Get It
review/text: Come on now, how much of this stuff actually DOES taste and smell good to adults.  The last time I bought it at Safeway, it tasted and smelled exactly the same--it's not Amazon's fault that grown-ups would rather eat pot roast with potatoes and gravy on the side.  So, if you don't like it, fire up the blender, and whizz up your unseasoned hunk of meat (which is why it smells so intolerable to our tastes and smells,btw) into a goopy smelly jelly (very much like the jar you're commenting on here). Walk through the market trying to convince your other kids to keep their hands inside the basket everyone's riding in, you stand in line at the end of the day with your feet killing you in those do-me heels guarding the gum and chocolate bars from the other day-care escapees (now busily reaching OUTside the basket for the gum and chocolate), and then embarassingly survive (you hope) the wet (or otherwise and getting smelly) diaper aroma.  Now, pay more for it than at Amazon,lug it all home while balancing tons of paper towels on your head (vs. waiting for the nice-looking UPS guy to set it inside the door where all you have to do is open it and put it on the shelf.)<br /><br />I like shopping in the quiet of my cleaned up kitchen after everyone's gone to bed, paying less for it (with a Prime Membership), and just putting it away when it arrives two days later.  I think that's what we're supposed to be rating and commenting on.  This works for me and rates five stars.

review/summary: The foulest thing..... ever
review/text: The beef, chicken, and turkey and gravy foods are disgusting. They are so disgusting, I didn't have the heart to feed this to my child. When I popped the lid to these the first thing I noticed was the foul smell. It made me gag. I can't even describe how bad this smelled. It was like rotten meat flavored jello. I didn't have the heart to make my daughters eat it so I gave it to my cats. None of them would go near it except for one who ate about 1/4 of it and walked away. Don't torture your child with this.

review/summary: So-Yuk!
review/text: This product is a rip-off. The previous reviewer said he could have used a few more noodles. I had trouble finding them in the sea of sauce, which was runny and  bright orange. The product looked NOTHING like the deceptive picture on the front of a delicious looking bowl full of creamy curry noodles. It was runny orange curried soup--more brothlike than creamy, with about 2 tablespoons of noodles and a few unidentifiable veggies. I bought another So-Yah! product when I bought this and it was equally misleading and unappetizing. Very disappointing, to put it mildly.

review/summary: Great taste of authentic curry!
review/text: Received this from Curry House in Cupertino, Ca. as part of a "surprise" packet that they sell once a year. The flavor was fantastic. A bit spicy. I later found out that the "dish" was vegetarian. Wow! The low calories is an added bonus. I can't state enough how great the curry flavor is. 90 seconds and it is done. Could use a few more shirataki noodles but other than that, I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves curry. The sauce is great over white rice too. Can't wait to try the Red Vindaloo Curry version.

review/summary: its okay.... hmmmm
review/text: In terms of taste, its a bit bland, but it seems if I combine this with a bit of meat, say, smoked sausage or some such, it becomes a bit more palatable.  its also an "acquired taste" that takes a bit of getting used to, but the chewiness factor is probably the reason for it being an acquired taste. Still, worth trying once, since everyone has different tastes... I wouldnt be so sure about buying this again, though even though its not bad as a lunch prep

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I have family in Finland and go there every few years to visit.  I always bring back candy, including this licorice. I was just eating some that I brought back and decided to see if they sell it on Amazon and was surprised to find it.  This licorice is very good and I don't really classify it as a licorice because I don't like licorice but like this stuff. Finnish licorice is different. In Finland, this type of licorice is very popular.  In the USA, licorice is not that popular at all, which I think is because it is so different and not that good.  If our licorice was like Finnish licorice, licorice would be much more popular in this country.  It is definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Best Black Licorice EVER!!!!
review/text: Moist, soft, and chewy, but not too sticky - best consistency of any licorice I've ever tried. Strong and distinct black licorice flavor - the most flavorful I've ever tasted. No ridges, lines, or holes (not "hollow"). No waxy consistency. The first bite was an amazing awakening - wow, that's what licorice is suppossed to taste like! I did a double take on the box - apparently the Finnish are licorice geniuses, who knew? Hands down, the BEST sweet black licorice I've EVER had (and I'm usually partial to the salty black licorice, but this is BETTER).<br /><br />Honestly, I'm not a big candy person and I bought this box on a whim, but was so blown away by how GOOD this licorice was that I felt it deserved a rave review. I actually went back to the store a purchased it from (Marshals, so it was an old overstock from somehwere, and STILL soft and chewy) and bought every box I could find in the store, then started looking online to see where I could find it for future purchases. I haven't purchased it from THIS seller though, but I'm assumming the product is the same.<br /><br />If you like black licorce - try it! AMAZING!

review/summary: packaged well; good for you
review/text: The Chia seeds came in a good, sturdy bag. My husband and I mix the very small seeds in yogurt to eat everyday. They don't really have a taste; you could put them on anything, but we like to put them in yogurt. They are nutritious, containing calcium and protein which is good for your tissues and brain functioning. They are easily digestible, even with someone like me who has had diverticulitis. Eating Chia seeds gives you more energy and endurance. It's an overall good thing to eat for your body. In the vitamin stores that we have been to, you can only buy them a jar. We were pleased to find larger amounts here and we feel the price is very reasonable. We will be re-ordering. Try them!

If you have never tried Chia seeds, you should do it! I will gladly purchase from this seller again.

review/summary: Super easy tamales!
review/text: Prior to finding Melissa's Corn Husks, I was limited to making tamales in the summertime when our sweet corn crop was harvested.  These dried husks cut down dramatically on prep time and labor!  The husks were larger than I expected, making the assembly of the tamales go quickly.  Soaking and cleaning them was easily accomplished as the directions indicated.  I also liked the authentic recipies included on the inner packaging.  Previously, I had surfed the net and tried several recipies for tamales before finding one that most reminded me of the homemade treats my friend's grandma used to make, and one of the recipes Melissa's suggested was almost a dead match for my favorite.  Plan on 2-3 hours to prep and cook a big batch, but the good news is that tamales freeze well and can be ready for a future dinner or side dish with a quick reheat in some foil.

review/text: Yes, I'm now officially a Reese's addict!<br />Amazon has shipped these promptly & then they were forwarded to me in Saudi Arabia. So, you can imagine how much time it spent in transit... They were fresh when they arrived & in perfect condition due to cold weather that helped keeping the chocolate from melting.<br />Now that I tried them for the first time I just can't get enough..! The first time they tasted kinda weird for me, but then when I got used to the chocolate & peanut butter combination, I realized it's one of those candies that wouldn't make you feel bad when you have more than 4 pieces..<br />I'm definitely ordering again -- perhaps next winter ;)

review/summary: Great new flavor for your bread
review/text: We like trying new flours for our home made bread (mostly sourdough).  Spelt works very well with sourdough starter.  Gives the bread a subtle nut like flavor and fine texture.  Plus, it doesn't affect the rise very much (we do add gluten to assist the sourdough rise).  Of amaranth, teff, and spelt, we like spelt the best.
