review/summary: My cats don't like the salmon
review/text: This is a great product and my three cats eat the Tuna Too Cool and the Tuna and Chicken canned food, but they don't like salmon, I guess.  You would just have to try it to know for sure.  This is a very healthy product because it contains NO GRAINS and is produced by human standards.  I know BFF is an excellent product.

review/summary: Look good to me but expensive
review/text: Best Feline Friend cat food cost more for less food. I did not try it but my cat eats few bites and look at me for something else. I found that it has a very strong smell of fish compared to other brand. In other word may be the food is too concentrated.Despite the much higher cost I would have given my cat this brand if he would have liked it.Sorry "Best Feline" but I did not decide. If you want more details ask Wicket, my cat.

review/summary: Not the best flavor of BFF
review/text: My cat completely ignores this flavor. Instead of the normal slab of meat, like BFF's other flavors, this one is soupy, and apparently not very good. My cat looks at me like I'm crazy when I give it to her. I don't know if I got a bad batch. If someone has gotten this, and it wasn't soupy, please leave a comment.

review/text: I am always looking for good quality cat food and thought I would give this a try.<br />Sadly it did not go down well in my house ! Two of my cats just walked away without a mouthful and the third ate about a quarter of a can.

review/summary: Cat loves it, but it STINKS horribly
review/text: I've been feeding my cat this food for about 2 weeks and my cat loves it. However, I feed my cat in the dining room and I eat my breakfast in the living room because the food stinks and the smell lingers.<br /><br />My cat seems very healthy and always has lots of energy after his meal. He seems very healthy and excited to be fed and licks the can clean.<br /><br />But I think I'll return to Tiki Cat or Newman's Own. I change his litterbox at least twice per day because I will not have my house smelling like animal droppings. I will not tolerate foul cat food smell either.

review/summary: My cat is a picky eater
review/text: and she will evetually "give in" and eat this food, but she doesn't "dive right in" as I had hoped she would do. Granted, she is a picky eater and an elderly cat, but I had hoped she would really enjoy this brand of organic food. I do better to cook and grind my own food for her. Heck, I made baby food when my daughter was a baby what's the difference for an old, sickly kitty cat? As expensive as this brand of cat food is I probably save money making my own. I am disappointed, but when I am a poor, old lady on a fixed income and have to eat cat food so I can buy my meds under Obama-care this is the brand I want to eat!

review/summary: This stuff stinks literally!!!
review/text: My cat Joshua is 13years old, he has been with me through thick and thin, good times bad times, you name it. When times were hard, he had to rough it with cat food from the ninety nine cents store, no complaints he ate it up. Lately times have been good so I wanted to buy him something special hence my decision to buy Best Feline Friend, Talk about a emotionally based decision!! this stuff is horrible!! it truly smells worse than any cat food I have ever come across not to mention the fact that he will not even come near the stuff, one whiff and he is walking in the opposite direction. This stuff may be good for cats but if they don't even want to eat it, whats the point? Here's some advice save your money and buy your cat what is good for them but at the same time something they enjoy, that's what your best feline friend deserves, not this stuff.

review/text: I have bought several different brands of pig ears. Most seem to use a tanning process in which the pig ears get soft, mushy, and smell horrible.<br /><br />These pig ears actually smell like pork and their crispy. My 10 week old puppy is able to devour a pig ear in one sitting.<br /><br />My pup will knaw on most pig ears for a few minutes and then give up on them while moaning and groaning in frustration.<br /><br />She can actually eat these ears from start to finish!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Y2TWQ">Smokehouse 100-Percent Natural Smoked Pig Ears Dog Treats, 24-Pack</a>  I was disappointed in the quality of this product.  The pig ears where supposed to have been "smoked" but they have zero smoke smell and almost smell a little on the spoiled side.  The pig ears cost $1.25 each when you buy them in the 24 count bag which is the same price I can buy non-smoked pig ears locally at Petco and Pet Smart.  Also the size of the pig ears are on the small side compared to similar products I have purchased in the past at the same price from other suppliers.  There is nothing really wrong with the product, my Boxer will chew them up regardless.  I guess I was expecting a higher grade pig ear based on the Amazon product description than what I actually received.

I didn't bother to un-tie the hand-knotted bag but put the LIGHTWEIGHT package back into the box in which it arrived and will now return them...For the price paid, I could go to one of the local pet supply stores and purchase MORE than 24 ears...and also would have an ear large enough to satisfy my large mix-breed pet! These ears are SMALL...while they appear to be ears, not strips, they are ridiculously small and have no weight to them. Color me disappointed. I thought about ordering another brand but this experience has made me gun-shy...or ear-shy !! Poor product; cheaply packaged in thin hand-knotted plastic bag...No thanks. My dog--and my wallet--deserve better !!

I usually cannot contain myself and will eat these bars on my way home (from Whole Foods, where I first discovered them).<br /><br />To top it off, the bars are nut-free (a major bonus point, as I am allergic, and the reason I tried them in the first place)--do you know how difficult it is to find tasty granola/cereal/otherwise bars without nuts in them AND at a price point that isn't prohibitive?

review/text: The product from a taste and quality standpoint was very good. I was surprised at the shape which was roundish balls instead of flat disks. Not a problem though, and it seemed to work better in terms of taste because of the bigger lemony flavor at the center.<br /><br />One disappointment was how little candy came in the one pound bag. Because of that, the price seems ridiculously high. This would be the only reason I wouldn't purchase again. Way too expensive for the quantity.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I don't generally crave candy or sweets that often, but if I have a weakness, it's sour lemon-flavored candy.  Here's the problem: I can never find one that satisfies me.<br /><br />Until now!  I have bought all sorts of different brands and types of sour lemon candies, in a bit of a "search for the Holy Grail" quest, and I believe I've found it.  These are absolutely great from start to finish.  They are sour all the way through, not like other candies that are coated with sour sugar, which gives you about 15 seconds of sour, and then are super-sweet the rest of the way.<br /><br />Everything about these is great, they're not too big and not too small.  And there's a bonus waiting for you in the middle:  A section of extra-sour lemony goodness that'll make ya pucker a little.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, these aren't annoying sour, like Warheads (which again, only are sour on the outside), but they are certainly have more kick than, say, your average lemon drop by Brach's or similar products.<br /><br />I recently got my order of 2 lbs. of these, which will last me a while, but I will certainly be re-ordering these again when I run out.  I've shared these with other lemon-loving friends of mine and they have all agreed on the quality.<br /><br />The only con:  They are slightly pricey, but I feel like I got my money's worth so I would absolutely buy these again.

review/text: I remember these being sweeter than the larger ones oddly. But I recently had the regular size and these and they both seem a tad on the salty side. I don't seem to enjoy them as much as I once did. I guess my tastes changed more than I thought. Or maybe the recipe? I just don't find them as delicious as I once remember them being. Still its a good product since they seem to be almost gone. Family still enjoys them.

review/text: ... these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004N5FR3S">Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures, 11-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> were just disappointing. I ordered them in early December to put in candy dishes around the house for holiday goodies. Imagine my surprise when the Reese's that showed up were all Halloween-themed--black and orange wrappers, with no red or green to be seen at all. Worse, the candies had undergone at least one round of melting and resolidifying; they were all warped, stuck to their wrappers in odd ways, with a grainy texture absolutely uncharacteristic of what Reese's should be.<br /><br />Like I said, I love Reese's. But I did not love these. Reese's may be my favorite chocolatey indulgence, but I'll be sourcing them elsewhere in the future.

review/summary: Fabulous taste
review/text: My sister's mother in law introduced us to these.  Her husband is Scottish and she said these were the closest you could get here in the states to what they taste like over there.  She warmed them up in the oven and oh my goodness they are decadent.<br /><br />I can't give a summary of the taste except to say that there is a start point of you need to like canned fish because that is what they are.  But the flavor and the depth of flavor is phenomenal and the fish itself is much more delicate in flavor and texture than tuna is (not that they are anything like tuna, but it's the only other canned fish I'd previously eaten).<br /><br />They were great just out of the can cold, but better heated up (a minute or two in the microwave, ten or so in the oven).  They were tasty on their own or on bagels.  Apparently they are considered a breakfast food over there so that's when we had them.<br /><br />One can will serve three people but once you've tasted them you won't want to share.

review/summary: Great kippers!  A keeper!
review/text: The John West kippers in sunflower met my requirements for a well flavored and firm kipper that does not fall apart on my fork.  The can was easy to open and the quality of the fish was excellent.  The smoked flavor was right on target and I can think of nothing negative to say except that it was hard to not open a second can and keep on eating!  The sunflower oil packing serves the kipper well and is a healthier choice than some other packings.  It did not create an oily fish, which I had feared.  I will continue my subscribe & save subscription and order again regularly!  The price was excellent for this larger can size and the free shipping and handling through subscribe & save is attractive!

The sunflower oil emptied from the tin and displayed freshness and tasted perfect.  Comparing this to the much cheaper selections is typical. . . you get what you pay for. While John West kippers are more expensive per ounce compared to some others, the product is a full magnitude fresher tasting and worth repeated eating!  The other kipper choices tried will be given to deserving pets and unwanted guests!  Many stars for John West Kippers!

We loved the first shipment we received but found that the bottom cone of each pack was broken, if not more.  I just received our second pack of 4 and over HALF of our cones are broken and can't be used.  They don't come with fragile written anywhere on the box nor do they come with enough packing to protect the delicate cones.  I can't find these in stores anywhere so I have to order them, but I feel as though half of my money is wasted.  The flavor of these cones is fantastic and don't get soggy but if we can't use half of them, it makes it hard to really enjoy them all.  I would recommend this product for the taste but would not recommend the way they come to your door.  It's really disappointing.

The Traditional Roast is my perfect coffee - smooth, not too strong, not too weak, doesn't seem to lose it's wonderful flavor even after sitting in the pot...it's wonderful. When I took my first sip, I was highly impressed and amazed at how different it is than regular ol' store bought stuff - Foldger's, House, generic brands - they really don't even compare. Normally, I use some non-dairy creamer and a packet of Sweet N Low for all of my coffee. When I tested the taste to see how much I'd need, I was blown away by the fact that the Traditional Roast coffee was so good, I didn't feel the need to put anything in it - that's a first.<br /><br />Excellent Coffee and I definitely recommend it.

review/summary: Love the Gevalia Traditional Roast!
review/text: It's to the point I hardly bother trying other coffees now, I always end up preferring this one.  I make mine quite strong, it's more like espresso, and it's just a good flavor coffee to me.  It's a dark red/brown looking clear liquid when I make it, not the darker brown almost black/opaque like some coffees are, I do not like the taste (or smell) of those darker types of coffees [but if you do, you might not like this Gevalia Traditional Roast].  I LOVE how this one smells when freshly brewed.  I like it black (no cream or sugar) or sometimes I add some milk.  I think its caffeine concentration might be high, sometimes when I've run out I substitute other coffees or drink tea or colas, and I can feel the caffeine headache coming on unless I overdose on the other caffeinated drinks.  I have also tried the Gevalia Traditional Decaffeinated and it's good also.<br /><br />Update 2/2/10 - this item was just removed from my subscribe and save order list.  Why?  The reason given was the product was discontinued, but I can see it's still available on Amazon.com.

The supervisor said that no one ever WAS going to contact me, so basically, "sorry about the six months of NO SERVICE from our customer service department."<br /><br />So my review is:  "DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IF YOU NEED TO CONTACT THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT, YOU WILL BE TREATED AS IS YOU DON'T EXIST BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND A COMPANY WHO DOESN'T CARE TO TAKE THE TIME TO ADDRESS GRIEVANCES."

review/summary: A cheap imitation of the real deal, but maybe worth a try if you have never tasted absinthe before
review/text: It is probably one of the most recognizable bottles if you are looking for absinthe.  After seeing the word "Absente", taking a look at the bottle with the attractive vintage-like label and the line "Absinthe refined" you are sure you have found a nice absinthe for not so much money.  Specially since most of the time the bottle comes in a box with an absinthe spoon as gift.  However, although nice, the presentation does not live up to the promise.  Specially after you take a look at the fake importation stamps.<br /><br />Problems with this drink:<br />- First, see the tag "Absinthe liqueur"?  A liqueur means a spirit that has been bottled with added sugar.  Real absinthe does not come with sugar.  You are free to add it later, but it should not come with it from the manufacturer.<br />- Second, it is made with Southern wormwood (Artemisia abrotanum).  To be considered real absinthe, it has to be made with grande wormwood (Artemisia absinthium).  Substitutions in the main ingredients are not valid when talking about absinthe.<br />- Third, it is artificially colored.  Real absinthe get its color from the chlorophyll of the plants of which is made, or no color at all; even though, the green is always subtle.  Being bright lime green is in no way a good thing.<br />These three points are enough for this drink to not be considered absinthe at all.  Some other things to consider are:<br />- It is overly sweet.  It's no wonder, considering it is bottled with sugar.<br />- You only can taste anise.  No other herbal flavors, or the subtle bitterness of wormwood.  Just anise.<br /><br />However, it has some good things:<br />- It is way cheaper than real absinthe.  If you are going to try it for the first time, it can be a good substitute; so if you decide later that you don't care for it, you are not out of a lot of money - this drink comes in mini bottles too.<br />- It does louche (meaning it changes color when you add water, turning milky).  That is always fun to watch.<br />- It provides a good example of what real absinthe tastes like.  Mainly of anise.<br /><br />Overall, this can be a fine pastis or absinthe substitute.  By all means, buy a bottle and share it with your friends at a party.  Just be advised that:<br />1- It is not absinthe.<br />2- You should not gift it to your absinthe-loving friend and expect a great reaction<br />3- You should not buy it if you have or plan to have an interest in real absinthe.  This spirit just does not cut it.<br /><br />P.S. I refuse to discuss thujone content and other non-sense and myths in my reviews.  If you are interested in thujone, go eat sage and forget absinthe altogether.

It has the taste of everyday vanilla salt water taffy.  I was naturally disappointed when I tried it.  Either the company has changed the recipe, or they use different brand ingredients.  If you hadn't eaten the original, you would be content with this one.  I wish the company would work on this some more and get it right, then everyone would like it!

review/text: I believe the recipe has been changed.  We remember this candy as our favorite from childhood days but what we received was not the same candy bar.  It does not break into many small pieces when hit against a hard table top unless it is first put in the fridge and it is not long and elastic when bitten into and pulled with your teeth as it did before so the consistency is not the same.  The taste also seemed to be less strong than it was before and our kids were not impressed when we put it in their Christmas stockings, which was a shame as my husband and I were trying to share a childhood favorite and pass the tradition down but were met with kids looking at us like we were strange!

review/text: Nourishing Traditons suggests using this grain.  We grind it and soak it overnight or as directed in bread recipes. My husband really loves the flavor, and he is hard to please. He usually buys white flour to make buscuits and I normally use Spelt for everything with occassional buckwheat, barley, and a few other grains.<br />I will have to find a bulk bag to fit our family ( 9 and growing!) But this was a good deal to try it out.  It is easy to work with, with the exception of fermented pizza dough.  I had to keep adding flour and it was still a bit gooey when I finally baked it.  I need to research, and as of now I think whole grains fermented just are harder to work with in these types of baking.  ( my buscuits did the same thing).

The kamut comes out very tough and chewy. It should be cooked for about three hours, adding water as necessary, then it is soft. I highly recommend this very nutritious food.

review/summary: Consistent Fulfillment mixups
review/text: I have placed four orders for this tea with Amazon, with five shipments.  The first one was perfect, and allowed me to discover the superb quality of the tea from the Diyagama West Estate.  While taste is very much a personal matter, this is my favorite Ceylon, and I have sampled more than a dozen high end Ceylon teas.  Therefore, even though the tea was relatively expensive, I was sold.  Soon thereafter I placed a second order.  This time I did not receive Diyagama West, rather a virtually identical looking package, but that clearly identified that its content was from the Kirkoswald estate.  Also a nice tea, but distinctly different, and, to my taste, nowhere near as sophisticated as the Diyagama West.  Since I opened the package, I used both of them up, and placed my third order. Received Kirkoswald again. This time I called Amazon and tried to correct the problem.  Amazon was great, as always. They promised to send a replacement of the correct product. The replacement I received was Kirkoswald AGAIN. Then I waited three months or so, and decided to try again.  Kirkoswald showed up once more.  I believe that whatever inventory location is supposed to hold the Diyagama has been stocked with Kirkoswald, and since the packaging looks so very similar, except for the estate name on the label, this way well remain uncorrected until the current stock runs out, and the bin location is replenished with the correct, Diyagama Estate product.<br /><br />When placing an order with Amazon, sophisticated, quick, and easy as it is, there is no way to add a comment or alert to CHECK the box and to NOT send Kirkoswald.  The only was to correct a mixup is through customer service after the product has been delivered. So on my fourth order, that is what I did, and Amazon, once again, corrected the financial aspect, but I am still without the tea I enjoy the most.

review/summary: Tea from the "Resplendent Island."
review/text: On Sri Lanka - which means "Resplendent Island" in Sanskrit - tea has been cultivated since the second half of the 19th century. After in 1869 most of the island's coffee plantations were devastated by a fungus that left the few (at the time, only experimentally planted) tea bushes untouched, a Scotsman named James Taylor, who had acquired some basic knowledge on tea plantation in Northern India, was put in charge of production. Under his shrewd management, output rose from a mere 23 lbs. to 81.3 tons between 1873 and 1880, and further to 22,899.8 tons by 1890.<br /><br />Most of Sri Lanka's tea plantations are situated at elevations between 3,000 and 8,000 feet in the island's southwestern part, to the east of Colombo and in the south. Although the island changed its official name from the colonial Ceylon (from Selan Dwipa, which possibly means "Island of Gems") to Sri Lanka in 1972, many companies continue to use the old name for its tea.<br /><br />Taylors' single-estate Ceylon tea comes from one of Sri Lanka's oldest and most distinguished tea growing areas, the Dimbula region on the western slopes of the southern/central mountain range; with plantations from approximately 3,500 to 5,000 feet above sea level. It is representative of the lighter teas for which this area is particularly well-known. Like all Ceylon teas, it makes for an excellent breakfast tea, but also great pick me up throughout the day.

review/text: These sucker are so good I have to keep them put on a high shelf so I won't eat them all at once, I only wish that they were bigger.  The chocolate/vanilla is the best sucker I've tasted.
