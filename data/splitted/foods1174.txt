review/summary: Yorkshire Red
review/text: I have enjoyed this tea for about fifeteen years. It was introduced to me by a tea shop owned by a Ms. Gray originally from London, England. She was a child there during the second world war. She was moved to the country side during the war because of the bombing of London. After thae war she moved to the United Staes settling in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I never questioned her about her reason to move here but suspect it was because of her marriage to an American soldier while he was in England. Ms. Gray and her daughter ran a tea shop in Bay View, an area on the south side of Milwakee. For a reason unknown to me she moved her business to Waukesha, a small city about twenty miles west of Miwaukee. Her new shop was located in the heart of Waukesha and drew many people. I moved to Waukesha in nineteen eighty and was introduced to the new shop by my wife. We then enjoyed breakfast there almost evey Saturday morning.<br /><br />My paternal grandmother was originally from London, having moved to Milwaukee at the age of seven, with her mother and her father, an engineer, who was sent to a new engineering office in Milwaukee by his employer in England in eighteen eighty two. She spoke to me at quite length about her childhood in England and Milwaukee. As a result I developed a kinship to the English people.<br /><br />One morning at the tea shop Ms. Gray sat down at my table and we discussed our past and other things. I then learned that Ms. Gray's grandfather had started the Gray's Pottery Company in England. My wife was a collector of English Children's Plates, epescially those from Gray's Pottery. We all became quite good friends, having a number of things in common.<br /><br />The tea Ms. Gray served as her "House Tea" was what she called Yorkshire Red, the very tea that I am speaking of here. It is a rather full bodied tea, often replacing coffee in many people's breakfasts. Taylors of Harrogate recommends the use of sugar and cream or milk in this coffee, the same way that I prefer it.<br /><br />The tea shop was closed in the late nineteen ninety due to the hard work required to make all the items the tea shop sold. These included skones and other baked items along with the breakfast staples served by Ms. Gray and her daughter. Yet Yorkshire Red remains my favorite beverage for breakfast. I have never lost my taste for it and probably never will. It has become an old friend of mine bringing back to me many fond memories. I suspect that you too will feel this way afer adding to your breakfast menu.<br /><br />Martin Ullstrup<br />Saint Francis, Wisconsin.

review/summary: Best Cuppa English Tea (In My Book)
review/text: First off, I'll let it be known that I'm English.  That means I have spent my lifetime drinking lots and lots of tea, which I think is compulsory when you're English.  I've had many different types of tea (mostly tea from England such as PG Tips and Typhoo) and when I finally stumbled upon Yorkshire Tea on a trip back home about 6 years ago I've been hooked.  This is by far my favorite tea and I drink 3-5 cups of it a day.<br /><br />Although many reviews say a bag is meant for a pot of tea that is not truly the case.  A bag is meant for a single cup of tea.  Now, some people may prefer a weaker cup of tea, like my mum who will use a bag twice since she prefers a weaker cup, but one bag is really meant for one cup.  Alas, to each his own.  I personally like a very strong cup of tea so I use one bag per cup and I allow it to steep for a minimum of four minutes.  Then I use a bit of half and half (whole milk at the minimum) and a half teaspoon of sugar.  Wallah, the perfect cup.<br /><br />As for price, well, Amazon cannot be beat!  I have searched high and low for this tea and have not once been able to find it for less than what Amazon sells it for in the States.<br /><br />Grab a cup and enjoy this very fine tea.  You won't be disappointed.

review/text: I use Yorkshire Loose Tea most of the time, brewing it by the pot. But, sometimes for a quick cup, tea bags come in handy. Everything in my review for the loose tea holds true for Yorkshire's tea bags. Be advised they make strong tea. One tea bag will brew a 14 oz. mug of very good flavourful tea.<br /><br />This is definitely tea for the tea lover. Enjoy!

review/summary: "I hope to make a pilgrimage to Taylor of Harrogate in England someday.
review/text: I ran out of this tea and couldn't find anymore locally so I was checking the Internet this morning, while gloomily sipping my Twinnings, to see if I could find some Taylor of Harrogate.  I'm so, so happy now to know that a 5-pack is on its way.<br /><br />  One dream of mine is to return to England to make a pilgrimage to Margaret Oliphant sites (if you're interested, skip her most famous books, except possibly for "The Doctor's Family" and go straight to "Agnes" or "He Who Will Not When He May" and on from there)and I do hope that I can add on a visit to Taylor's of Harrogate, if it's open for visitors.<br /><br />  I didn't think that I was picky, picky about tea until I tried Taylor's of Harrogate.

review/summary: Strong, Fragrant and Economical
review/text: One day an English pal of mine and I got into a discussion about tea vs. coffee.  Being a consummate coffee drinker I felt that no tea could ever satisfy me.  He was used to drinking instant coffee and therefore I felt that I must educate his palate.<br /><br />He sent me a package of Taylor's of Harrogate Yorkshire Tea and from that very first taste I was hooked. This tea is a blend of Assam and African tea and makes a deep, dark, rich, fragrant cup of tea.  Dark and strong enough to make me not crave my coffee over much!  While I will never give up my Sumatran coffee, this make an ideal substitute for when I'm getting an upset stomach from too much coffee.  It's so much less acidic.<br /><br />Plus I found out quite by accident just how economical this tea was.  While the English may not print directions for every little thing like us Americans do, I wasn't sure without directions just how long I was supposed to brew the tea or how big a mug I should brew it in.  We with trial and error I found that one tea bag will make a wonderfully strong 24 ounce mug of tea (yes I did measure it!) and I suspect that if I let it brew and steep a little longer one bag may get nearly a whole small pot (36 ounces)out of it!<br /><br />I'm hooked and it's all thanks to Yorkshire Tea and my pal Frank!

Almost as good as the superb Whittard, Yorkshire offers an excellent full-bodied cup of tea.  Never bitter, it is a drinking pleasure.  I highly recommend.

review/summary: not made in the USA
review/text: Hi. I just wanted to point out two things about these chews. First of all, they are made in Mexico not the USA. Therefore, the ingredient list is misleading when it says "American" beef hide because it is meant to make you think that the beef hide is from the United States of America. More accurately, it should read, "North American" beef hide to distinquish it from being from Asia (note, the label does not specify the origin of the hydrolysed vegetable protein which could be wheat gluten). Secondly, these chews do not contain chlorhexidine like the "C.E.T" brand and this may be an ingredient you want if your dog has peridontal issues. My dogs like these chews and I think they do help to a small extent to clean the teeth. gb

review/summary: Awesome horsepills
review/text: First off, I think the reviews on this page are confusing.  It seems to me there is a mix of people who bought the container of oil and those that bought the pills.<br /><br />I bought the pills and am enjoying them very much.  I read news reports on how coconut oil may help with Alzheimers, diabetes and diet so I thought I'd try them since I have issues with all of these in my family line.  I feel more mentally focused and alert since I've started taking them a week or so ago.  I definitely plan to continue to take the pills.<br /><br />They are large as many people have noted (see my photo uploaded with the quarter), but they are not any bigger than any other large vitamin.  The pills, like other vitamins, do have a slight smell if you stick your nose in the bottle.  But they have no taste, no after taste and no gross burps later.<br /><br />The bottle calls for 3 pills 3x a day.  9 seems pretty excessive for vitamins.  I'm taking 6 right now, 3 with my coffee in the morning and 3 with dinner since I usually only have 1 or 2 meals a day.<br /><br />I would note that taking these has loosened some things up, you know -- down there.  It's not an emergency bathroom thing but you probably will be flowing pretty freely when you do go.  I'm assuming my body will eventually adjust and become more regular but it's not really bother if it doesn't.

review/summary: Off Taste
review/text: As the other reviewer mentioned, it does have more of a coconut smell than the other 2 I bought, but it has an off taste to it that the others do not. Reading about coconut oils, someone mentioned the gag factor. I had no idea what they were referring to until I tasted this. NOW's a good name, but they fell short here. You'd be better off with Jarrow or Nutiva, similar price, better taste...

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: My primary reason for buying this product was to help my digestive system.  I have iron deficiency anemia, but I could not tolerate any brand of iron supplement, and the shots were extremely painful. So I became extremely anemic and needed transfusions. Consequently, I couldn't take a chance anymore on not using iron tablets and I had to find a way to take them without suffering.<br />Because I use coconut oil and milk in my cooking and for skin/hair care, I've done research on the benefits of this amazing seed, and I thought that these capsules might help me to tolerate iron tablets.  Well they have, and I am now able to tolerate 3 daily doses of ferrous sulfate, so I'm in compliance with my doctors orders and my hemoglobin level is rising.

review/summary: yuck!!
review/text: This oil has a rancid, off-putting odor that smells NOTHING like coconut, more like yeast.  It also has a TERRIBLE taste.  DO NOT BUY!!!<br /><br />I consume a jar of coconut oil a week because I take it as a supplement and cook with it.  Jarrow, Spectrum, Nutiva, Vitacost and Swanson are MUCH better.  Their coconut oils smell really good with a fresh, coconut scent and taste great too.<br /><br />I was surprised because I use other NOW products and am happy with them. The quality, judging by my experience & others', is that this may just be a faulty jar but the quality isn't consistent.  I don't see bad reviews from the other oils I use & I have never had a bad batch from the others I have mentioned.

review/summary: Coconut Oil capsules
review/text: Purchased this and Flaxseed Oil to help punch up my HDL "good" cholesterol levels. Not sure how it is working yet but they seem to work fine and I feel better taking them. We also use Coconut oil in bulk form for cooking as the fat composition is supposed to be better for you than other vegetable oils. As for capsules, I have read other reviews that say these "taste bad".... but I have never had this problem. Because they are capsules I am unsure how anyone could taste them anyway, unless they were punctured or chewed. They are rather large capsules, but they go down fine. I would recommend them.

review/text: This product is great, if you want to take small doses of coconut oil.  If you are planning on taking doses based on weight and need more than a teaspoonful per dose, you might just want to go for regular oil, as these capsules only hold about 1/8 tsp of oil.  Otherwise, they are fine :)

review/text: As a frequent NOW customer, I was surprised at the poor quality of their coconut oil.  It was yellow, cloudy, and smelled so rancid that I didn't dare eat it.  NOW usually sells good products, so maybe I just got a rare bad batch of coconut oil - who knows?  I think I'll stick with Nutiva organic VCO, which has never disappointed me.

review/text: Although I love coconut oil and know of all the benficial ways to use it, this coconut oil tastes too coconutty for me.  I have to agree with other reviewers in that the smell is so strong it almost seems like an artificial scent. I dont mind coconut flavor and scents but this is almost too much.  It almost makes me gag.  I'll be going with Nutiva next time.

review/text: I don't eat this. I use it on my skin and in my hair. It is great for locs as it is a light-weight conditioner and has a subtle coconut scent that quickly dissipates. It won't weight your hair down, make it hard; or, get kind of rancid like castor oil can. It was fresh and well packed. I recommend it as a great natural softening product for hair and skin, especially right after a bath/shampoo.

review/summary: Coconut Palms and Ocean Breezes: Paradise Rising?
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 9:08 Mins<br /><br /></span>While this review features the book, COCONUT OIL MIRACLE, it displays and describes other products [including coconut oil] which that book catalyzed into a healing synergy. I've reviewed most of the products shown in this video.<br /><br />Johanna Galt, thank you for your comment and question posted under the original written review I had submitted here, which I've deleted and replaced with this video [6/25/10]. Most of the content below was written in response to your question.<br /><br />I had purchased this brand a few years ago, and to be honest, I don't recall much about the flavor.  It was my first experience cooking with coconut oil, and I hadn't yet read any books on it.  The brands I've used recently and favor most for quality, aroma, and flavor are:<br /><br />EFAGold Coconut Oil, Extra Virgin, Organic, 16 oz.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />Both of those brands, from my experience, are excellent quality.<br /><br />When I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle (by Bruce Fife)</a> I learned a greater variety of uses of the oil and how to work with its relatively hard texture.  I had kept it in the refrigerator until I read Fife's book and learned the oil [if it's in good condition when purchased] could be safely kept in the cupboard, usually for a year or more.  There's lots of interesting, valuable information in that book, which helped me conveniently expand my usage of this miracle oil.<br /><br />I had recently read the later reviews on this NOW Foods offering and had felt that possibly I was lucky to get a better quality batch than some of those reviewers, because I don't recall the oil tasting off.  But after reading those reviews and experiencing what might be higher quality products [linked above], I will probably stay with EFAGold or Nutiva, but I'm curious enough to try the NOW Foods product on this page again for flavor and purity comparison, in case the poor reviews came from an uncommon occurrence of a bad batch of the product.<br /><br />The EFAGold jar I received seemed to be of slightly higher quality, but Nutiva is very near as good, and sometimes priced more economically.  The information on some of the Amazon product pages for Nutiva is interesting, very helpful, and impressive.  I'm now cooking so much with the oil that I bought the larger size, Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 54 oz.  But I will also keep the 15 oz jars, as they're convenient to take with me away from home.<br /><br />To be fair, I should buy this NOW brand again to compare it to these others which I've experienced.  I've used other NOW Foods products and have been pleased with them.<br /><br />I've noticed additional brands available on Amazon which look good, too.  From the information in Fife's book, I might try any oil which is cold pressed [ANH, absolutely no heat] and extra virgin.<br /><br />I LOVE cooking with coconut oil.  It seems to me to enhance the integrity of the flavor of the food it's used with, and the savory flavor of beef steaks and other stronger meats can be furthered and the coconut edge removed by use of garlic, onions, and salty spices added to the oil when cooking.<br /><br />Some of my reviews on the above linked product pages give different information from this one, and hopefully more helpful written information from the original one which had been posted here.  In view of some of the comments and the collected "NO" votes on that review, I decided to post this video, to delete the original written review, and plan to include a copy of it at the end of the first 6 comments which had been made on the original review.<br /><br />May pleasant aromas follow your nose,<br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />NOTE: If you have a magnesium deficiency like many people are experiencing now, feel free to read some of my reviews on magnesium products for information about ways to retain that index mineral into your system at adequate levels.  Most coconut oil has a lot of potassium in it, which can replace some of the needed magnesium.

review/summary: Awesome Product...
review/text: MY EXPERIENCE WITH COCONUT:<br />A few things first... I have done extensive research on Coconut oil & the benefits it has on our bodies.  I can tell you that the antiviral benefits it has definitely works. After a couple of days of sleeping a ton, being very sick & calling me at work crying because she couldn't stay awake, I took my daughter (13 y.o. then 17 now) to the doctor & she was diagnosed with Mono. The doctor explained to me that it is part of the Epstein Barr family (cold sores, herpes, etc.) and that there isn't any kind of medicine that can "cure" the illness. He explained that she would sleep a lot, that I needed to call her school & tell them what she had & that she would only be there half days for a few months. I was deflated, stressed & couldn't believe there was nothing I could do for her. I had recently read a book that included coconut oil as a way to detox, lose weight, boost metabolism and so many others and had bought some oil to cook with & take daily. I had done a search & read as much as I could about the coconut & remembered reading that it killed the Epstein Barr virus. I went straight to my computer when I got home & did another search & found the article I had read. I decided to give my daughter the oil twice a day to see if it helped her. I called her down & melted the oil in a spoon & had her take it that afternoon & then again later that evening.  The next morning before I left for work I gave her another dose. She called me around lunch time very happy and excited and said she wasn't tired and could stay awake. I remember thinking that the oil was working and was very relieved, but still a bit hesitant.  When I got home to my surprise, she was very excited, wide awake & for the first time since she was sick, was chipper and I could tell she was getting back to her old self. I gave her another dose of the oil that evening & for a few days after and she was all better.  The oil had killed the virus and restored her health.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who has any illness, pain or arthritis type conditions.  My old dog eats some oil, that I cook with, in his food for treatment of possible arthritis in his hip. He has stopped limping & can raise up from a laying/sitting position better than he has in a long time. It is also the first thing he eats in his bowl (I just take about a tablespoon and toss it on top of the dry food). HE LOVES IT!!<br /><br />ABOUT THIS PRODUCT HERE:<br />I have been taking these pills for about 3 weeks now to help raise my metabolism & to help lower my cholesterol.  I haven't been back to the doctor to see how it is working for my cholesterol, but I can say that it has boosted my energy levels more than any other oil or coconut product I have tried yet.  The closest I've come to this level of energy boost was when I drank some homemade coconut milk from a coconut we bought from the store. Also, When I dropped my daughter off at work yesterday, she was exhausted (stayed up late texting or Twittering I would bet)& I handed her one of these pills & told her it would give her energy... As she walked away she stuck it right in her mouth & swallowed it!! When she came home that night I asked her if the pill worked & she said yes!!  From a TEEN mind you!! This is the same child up top there that knows that this stuff works! I highly recommend this product if you are a coconut user and if you're not... What the H E double toothpicks are you waiting for???

review/summary: On a coconut kick...
review/text: Besides my balsamic kick, I'm kind of on a coconut kick. Purchased a few books stating how good coconut oil is for us. I've been cooking with it which I think actually makes things cook better (tastier). The literature I've read states that coconut supplements are good for you. So, I figured I'd try it. Can't say one way or another if it works. Haven't felt different (good or bad) since taking it. Good news is there is no weird after taste (like you can experience with fish oils).

review/summary: Just what I was looking for
review/text: I received the gum today and like it better than I had expected to.<br /><br />I only chew 1 piece at a time (the serving size on the box says "2 pieces" and many customers who have rated it under other listings on amazon have said they chew 2 pieces at once) but it is big enough for my purposes.<br /><br />Also, I chew it only for about 15 minutes and the flavor lasts with no problem at all.<br /><br />I mainly wanted this specific gum because of the high percentage of xylitol it contains (because xylitol is good for the health of teeth) and because of its LACK of other stuff (which is in almost all other types of gum) that I don't want like aspartame (nutrasweet), saccharin, sorbitol, mannitol, artificial flavors, artificial colors, etc.<br /><br />---<br />A few years ago I tried two brands of "natural" gum that didn't have any of those ingredients I'm trying to avoid, but they were awful - fell apart in the mouth, tasted bad, contained sugar, etc.<br /><br />So I grudgingly went back to chewing Orbit with xylitol because my dentist told me to chew gum for the sake of my teeth, even though in all other ways I scrupulously avoid aspartame etc. I limited myself to one piece a day of Orbit because I didn't really want to be ingesting the unwanted stuff.<br /><br />Therefore, I'm really pleased to have found this gum this week. Because it has the right blend of ingredients for me, even if the flavor had been nonexistent, I would have been happy with it, so I'm extra-pleased that there is a nice mint flavor and that it does last for at least 15 minutes (I only want to chew it for that length of time, so I didn't try it for longer).<br /><br />---<br />Note that this gum is manufactured in Finland and the xylitol is sourced from birch wood [also, it's non-GMO (not genetically modified)], which is not the case with some other up-and-coming brands of xylitol gum, which source their xylitol from China and/or from corn.<br /><br />---<br />Apparently if the mouth has 5 exposures to xylitol a day, its health improves greatly after only a few weeks.<br /><br />(My main concern is to reinforce the enamel of my teeth as much as possible, because they have been sensitive for years and the sensitivity is getting worse with age.)<br /><br />To that end, I'm going to order a 16-ounce package of xylitol crystals/powder soon (I found a cheaper offer on another site than I did here) and mix a little of the powder with water each day in a jar and swish the solution around my mouth a couple of times a day, so I can extend the lifespan of my stock of this expensive gum by chewing it just once or twice a day.<br /><br />If you want to avoid xylitol from China and/or from corn, also take care when purchasing the crystals/powder in either 16-ounce packages or small single-serving packages - I found very few brands that get their xylitol from birch.

review/text: My dogs love these bones.  I bought all sizes.  My jack russel loves the big ones and the small ones.  My 60 pound mutt loves the big ones. They are great.  They are able to digest them and able to enjoy the bones.  I bought so many of them.  Petsmart for some reason discontinued them I was so upset.  I was so happy to see them on Amazon for a great price. I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Doesn't last long for agressive chewers
review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/summary: R dog luvs these
review/text: Our Siberian Husky is overweight and on a diet.  She also is great at building placque and tartar on her teeth - baad breath! She has a touchy stomach on top of it all.  Tried these bones in all flavors and she loves them.  They help with her teeth and breath.  She gets one bone for her lunch (she's a 3 meals a day gal).  Her other meals are now canned green beans with either yogurt (plain) or low fat cottage cheese.  She has lost about 11 lbs and is doing great!  No more throwing up her food!

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

review/text: My chihuahua loves these, especially the peanut butter, chicken, and bacon varities. They have become increasingly hard to find at pet stores so I was happy to find them on amazon. I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.

review/summary: Perfect size snacks for Dog Toy
review/text: Until recently I was purchasing these snacks at my local Pet Supermarket. They no longer carry them so I went to Amazon.com. The reason they are perfect for my two dogs ( a Lab and a Chow mix) is not the size obviously but because I have a dog toy that is one of those toys that you pull out the center and fill the different layers inside with treats. After putting the center piece back in you shake it around and the dog has to learn to push it with his nose or paws to get the treats to lay just right to fall out. Well my Lab learned in one day and just loves this toy. The ONLY treats that I have found that fit are this brand and he loves all the flavors but especially the cheese flavor and the yogurt brand. There are quite a lot in one bag and reasonably priced. Yes, I will buy more!<br />Buddy Bits Rocks!

review/summary: Buddie Bits Review
review/text: My three chihuahuas (4 lbs, 8 lbs, 9.5 lbs) love these little treats.  The treats are small so that they are easy on their little mouths and teeth and they are small enough not to contain way more calories that I want them to have (have to keep them trim and healthy).  They are also lightly crispy rather than hard and crunchy (many chihuahuas have dental problems), so I don't have to worry about gum  or tooth damage or pain.  From the response that I get whenever my chihuahuas just see the package in my hand and the way they dance around until they get their treat, I have no doubts about how much they enjoy these little crispy treats.<br /><br />I first purchased Buddy Bones (a bigger treat but same recipe) from my local Pet Supplies store and broke them into smaller pieces because they were larger treats and my little dogs had some trouble chewing them.  Pet Supplies quit carrying these treats so after checking Petsmart and Petco, I was getting a little discouraged.  Then I had the (its seems to most non dog lovers I'm sure) thought to try on Amazon and here they are. Not only did I find the treats my dogs love, but I found a much smaller version and I do not have to break them up into smaller pieces.  Now when it's treat time, my three little dogs don't look at me with disappointment any more.

review/summary: My Dog Loves These Treats - Far More Than Any She Has Ever Had In Her 12 Years As My Companion
review/text: I received these Best Buddy Bits for my dog about 6 weeks ago - and she absolutely loves them.  At 12 years of age, she is far from training age where I could use these as training treats, but historically, she has loved chicken flavored treats more than any other flavor of treats.  That is why I bought these treats, and she has loved me for it from day one.  She has a habit of prancing on her hind legs over to me when I get out her treats and she hears the bags crinkling.  However, with these treats she runs towards me and starts standing on her hind legs so excited to get these treats.  I have never seen her so excited to get a treat in her 12 years with me.  I think that goes to the quality of the treats, and to her love of her master when I give her these treats. LoL.<br /><br />My dog is a small Rottweiler at about 65 pounds.  However, that is big enough that I have to give her about 20-25 bits each time I give her these treats.  Times three times a day, that is a lot of treats.  I am certainly glad I purchased four bags of these Best Buddy Bits.<br /><br />I will have to tell you that until I received my shipment from Amazon, for some reason, I thought these treats were named Best Buddy BITES.  I do not know how I made such a blunder.  Imagine my embarrassment (in front of my dog since she was the only one around) when I realized that I had been wrong this entire time. Oh well, at least I am certainly straight on the name now!<br /><br />One last item, the Crude Fat (min) level of these treats is 13%, it is a bit more than I usually like to give my dog, but I will overlook it on these treats because she absolutely goes bonkers for these treats.  The things I do for my dog.

Will do all their tricks and listen perfectly for these treats......was so happy to find them on Amazon, my local pet store carried them for a long time then tried something new.

review/summary: Yeah  for Best Buddy Bits
review/text: Our dog Callie loves these treats.  Her Auntie from Connecticut sent her these for her birthday and she loved them so much that after she ran out, we found them at Amazon. (of course)  We bought 2 more bags.  Callie sniffed the box they came in and got all excited.  She has the nose of a lab.  She is a 60 pound dog and these little treats go a long long ways.  They are small in size but get so much reward for the bite.  One bag will lasts for several weeks because you choose how much to give.  You can give 1 or 10.  The bag never seems to finish.  There is a lot of enjoyment out of one of these little bags because you can teach your dog tricks and reward them with like I say 1-10 little bits.  We love them also because they are healthier than other treats.  She loves them because they are good.  That's all that matters.  By the way you can't beat the price.

review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

review/summary: Best treat for finicky dogs!
review/text: My akita is an extremely finicky dog. He is hard to train with food since none of the treats I buy seem to please him...until I got the Exclusively Dog Best Buddy Bits Peanut Butter Flavor Dog Treats for him. He is now trained and well behaved. He would do anything for these delicious and easy to dissolve treats! These little treats are perfect for training!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DJNMQ">Best Buddy Bits-Cheese Flavor 5.5 oz.  package</a>. This treat contains garlic powder which is toxic to some dogs according to my Vet. My dog as well as a relative's dog became violently ill after eating these treats. We both ended up with $ 400 Vet bills. I contacted the manufacturer, Exclusively Pet, Inc. months ago but I never heard back from them.

review/summary: Nothing but the best for my baby! :-)
review/text: This is super premium dog food taken to a new level - BREED SPECIFIC. Eukanuba already makes some of the best dog available, and now they have tailored it from large breed to specific breeds. My dog likes the food, it keeps her teeth clean (which helps the breath), and I just feel like I am doing everything I can to meet her nutritional needs. Her coat is in great shape and she has lots of energy. No problems with digesting. The only downside is the cost, but in life, you get what you pay for.

review/summary: Premium Dog Food!
review/text: I ordered about 8pm on 10/23 and got my order around 3pm on 10/24. My order was very fast and I expect nothing less of amazon! My dog absolutely loves this food, but of course all dogs love any kind of food lol My rottie's coat is very smooth and shiny. This is exactly what Eukanuba advertised so I'm very pleased with the results.<br /><br />Thank you amazon for the expedient service!

review/summary: pretty good
review/text: just recently started buying this for our 2 rotties, one is almost 2 and the other is ~16 months. we have tried other brands, (wellness, 3 different types of Iams) and so far this seems to be doing the best.  my oldest seems to have less issues with allergies, their coats have gotten softer (my older one is almost back to his soft puppy coat) and the younger is not nearly as gassy as he was (especially on the wellness, not a bad food, just seems to effect large breeds this way). they are in no way finicky eaters so that wasnt a problem and switching them took no time at all. they have been stuck inside more than usual lately so i dont know how its effecting their energy yet. id give it 5 stars but it is a little expensive, though the cost is about what we paid for the wellness large breed.. so far seems to be worth it. i would recommend at least trying it..

review/summary: Natural Beef Jerky
review/text: John Wayne All Natural Beef Jerky is Great!  I am a low-carb, diet-controlled diabetic and find the JWANB jerky the best meal substitute for those days when life happens and I don't have access to a regular meal.  I carry an unopened package in my bag and replace it as needed.  I can get carbs almost anywhere but good protein is not as easy to find. The jerky is a little sweet to my taste but not to my carb count and its not loaded with salt. Good stuff!

review/summary: OK, but the Golden Valley brand Organic is better
review/text: I bought this product and the Golden Valley Natural Organic (Original) in order to compare them.  They're exactly the same price per ounce (the Golden Valley product is organic; the John Wayne organic is more expensive).  They're similar, both fall into the "soft" beef jerky category with no artificial ingredients.  However, the John Wayne product is a bit mealy and has a subtle but funny aftertaste.  This outweighs the single shortcoming of the Golden Valley product, which is that it is a bit too sweet.

review/summary: Disappointed to say the least
review/text: No doubt with the name John Wayne on the package the surviving Family is getting some coin out of each sale.  Did they taste the product?  I have had this same looking / tasting jerky many a time bought right out of the local Supermarket for the same price or less.. Translucent, soft (high moisture) and sweet.  If you like a dryer, smoked, slightly saltier jerky keep on looking. I should have waited for a few more reviews before pulling the trigger.

review/summary: Excellent, all natural Beef Jerky!
review/text: This is excellent, tasty beef jerky! All natural with NO MSG and NO Nitrites. Not too salty and not too high in sodium. This makes a great protein snack. I bought the same pack for $9 at the John Wayne Airport in Orange County and had to have some more...of course, buying here on Amazon is way cheaper than what I paid at the Airport gift shop.

review/text: LOVE THIS STUFF!!!  It's so GOOOD!!!  No chemicals in it!  No NITRITES, no GLUTEN!  Try to find another beef jerky<br />without gluten!  Only their 3oz size is gluten free, but it says it right on the front of the package.  It tastes fantastic!<br />I only WISH I could buy it at a store in my area cause I would eat it EVERYDAY!  I get it on auto order cause I love it that much!<br />It's great to get to eat beef jerky and not worry about MSG!  IT's the best EVER!!!
