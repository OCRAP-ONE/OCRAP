review/summary: weak to my taste
review/text: The good news is this coffee doesn't have the taste I think of as "conference coffee".  The bad news to my taste is it doesn't have flavor at all.

review/text: I like bolder strong coffee, so I thought I'd give this a try, and boy am I glad. Sometime when coffee gets stronger it can get bitter, but not this, it is still smooth and rich. I drink my coffee black, so I am fussy, but this is a great anytime cup when you need that little  lift.

review/summary: Coffee is great. Potential quality control, packing, or shipping issue.
review/text: The coffee is great. It is my favorite K-Cup so far. However, there were coffee grounds all over most of my K-Cups. Oddly, they were all intact, so I'm not really sure where the grounds came from. I tried cleaning them off. Still, when I brew them I get more coffee grounds in my cup than any other brand I've tried to date. It is still a great flavor, but I wish the manufacturer or Amazon would be more careful with the product.

review/summary: Not bad but not the best
review/text: I ordered this pack because I thought the price was decent and I was tired of the same K-cups all the time.  I drink 2 cups of it per day and it saves me the trip to Starbucks although I don't think the coffee is quite as good.  If you are a total coffee 'snob' then you might not like it, but if you like coffee but prefer to have something a little better than maxwell house or folgers, this might strike the right balance for you.

review/summary: STRONG Coffee for the Keurig
review/text: I like strong, dark coffee, so I am usually disappointed by k-cups, which tend to be a little on the weak side.  I usually pack my own coffee cups (using a Keurig adapter)so I can get a strong brew, but my Keurig sometimes malfunctions when I use the adapter.  I decided to try Jet Fuel instead, and I was not disappointed -- smells rich, tastes great.  If you want that strong coffee smell and taste, you won't go wrong here.

review/summary: Perfect for making lattes
review/text: I was searching for the perfect K-Cup to make lattes at home. I wanted one that tasted the most like coffee shop espresso. Jet Fuel is the hands-down winner! It's rich, bold and slightly bitter, which is perfect for lattes. I brew it on the smallest setting so that it is more concentrated. I heat milk with flavored creamer and pour it into the Jet Fuel. Then I whip it with my little hand-held frother. It tastes as good as, if not better than, a coffee shop latte at less than half the price! So wonderful! I would not drink Jet Fuel straight, but it is the perfect choice for lattes.

review/summary: Boldest K-Cup I Found
review/text: After I got my Keurig coffee maker and tried some of the brews available in K-Cups, I thought I might have to settle for a less bold coffee.  Based on some reviews on Amazon.com I went with Coffee People Jet Fuel and I've been very pleased for a couple of years now.  I do the subscribe and save option, which is great for me and a pretty good deal (at least for K-Cups).

review/text: In no way would I consider these k-cups having a bold flavor. In fact, I usually have to use two of them on the espresso setting to get any enjoyable flavor from them.  If I were you I would stick with the Donut Shop k-cup as it has a more natural coffee shop taste.

review/summary: Best K-Cup for Strong Coffee Drinkers Yet
review/text: I've had my Keurig for a year, and my only complaint has been the quality of the coffee made:  Not bad, but not nearly strong enough for people who think their coffee should run like molten lava rather than a fast trickling stream (OK, not really sludge, but you get what I mean).  The closest I came to finding a good cup was Dunkin Donuts' Dunkin Dark, but they are pretty expensive from the store.<br /><br />After reading the reviews here, I decided to give Jet Fuel a try.  WHOA!  This is proper coffee that will put hair on your chest, but also tastes DELICIOUS.  Buying in packs of 50 for a family with 3 coffee drinkers (and frequent visitors) also means fewer trips to the store for coffee.<br /><br />Very happy I chose to buy this brand, and now enjoy my morning hassle-free cup of coffee!

review/text: We've been receiving Jet Fuel via Amazon's "Subscribe And Save" program for about a year.  The coffee is dark and strong, as we like it.  Subscribe And Save is a great convenience.  However, with coffee prices creeping up as they are, we are re-thinking the whole single-serve coffee thing.  May put away our Keurig brewer and haul out the ol' drip maker from the back of the cabinet.  The taste of the coffee rates five stars.  If factoring in the price, it would be fewer stars.

review/text: I was drinking Timothy's San Lorenzo Dark, but apparently it's no longer sold in the US market, so I was looking for a replacement. Jet Fuel is a little stronger, but very good! Many of the "bold" and "strong" K-Cups have a bitter or burnt taste that I don't like, but this one is perfect. It's strong and gets me going in the morning but still tastes good.<br /><br />I took a bunch in to share with my co-workers and they all liked it as well. Definitely a winner in my book!

review/summary: My fave extra bold coffee
review/text: I don't like bitter coffee, which I associate with the term "extra bold". Jet Fuel is anything but bitter! Now, I use a B-60 and I make a couple brews off the same kcup on the large setting because I drink a lot of coffee and I'm cheap. I'll brew both into the same (rather large) cup to even out the tastes. It still tastes very good, but not as bold. A little creamer for me and I'm good to go! I now drink this more than the Kona blend from Coffee People. I also appreciate how cheap it is!

review/text: My husband loves strong coffee so he loves Jet Fuel. I was able to order it when it was subscribe and save so its very convenient. I wish Amazon would have other options for automatic shipments though. With this product you can estimate when you will need more very easily. The only other subscribe and save kcups available are made with "instant coffee" and they are horrible :(

review/summary: Very Strong
review/text: This coffee is OK, I have yet to buy a k-cup that has the same body that a regular brewed cup of coffee has. While this is strong in taste (almost too much), it lacks something that a regular drip brew has, almost kind of watery. Still a better k-cup than some that I've had. I do like the bulk amazon packaging though.

review/text: This is great coffee don't get me wrong ... I love how strong it is, but it should taste better than this. It's got that somewhat almost stale taste to it ... not so bad I don't drink it but enough that I am not choosing it every morning amongst the selection I have now. I drink my coffee black so I am pickier. A friend of mine tried it and she adds milk to her coffee... she loved it!!

review/text: Got this to try another type.  I have been drinking the rain forest extra bold and that is pretty good.  I can make a decent cup of coffee that fills a mug.  Even the largest size on the Kurig is OK.  Anyway, the Jet fuel is quite similar and I can't tell much of a difference.  They are both strong enough for my taste.  One problem I did have, is the cardboard box was so large it would not fit in the kitchen cabinet.  It is one of the "frustration-free" Amazon boxes.

review/summary: fixed the grinds problem; great coffee!
review/text: Jet Fuel is nice and strong coffee with excellent flavor!  Once in a while the kcup releases coffee grinds into the liquid. I contacted Green Mountain Roasters, who make Jet Fuel, and they suggested this fix:  when inserting your kcup into your coffee machine, push the kcup DOWN onto the little puncture needle until it is sitting firmly in place.  Then continue as you normally would for your Jet Fuel cup.  The grinds-into-the-coffee should not happen again.  Reason: pushing DOWN releases some of the pressure in the kcup which prevents the problem.  This has worked for me and I haven't encountered the problem since.  If you have a problem with quality, go to the Green Mountain Roasters website and send customer service an email. They were very responsive when I emailed them!  They'll want the lot number on your Jet Fuel, so be prepared!

review/summary: Manufacturing error?
review/text: I love the flavor of this coffee, but I agree w/ the post that it may be poorly manufactured.  I frequently have to clean my Keurig from blown out K-cups.  I suspect that problem is more of a coffee maker issue than the K-cup though.  My biggest complaint however is a recent apparent manufacture error.  I received K-cups which show they are Coffee People Jet Fuel but they have a distinct, nasty sweetened mocha flavor.  They're definitely not Jet Fuel flavor.  I cannot find a place to post a complaint to either Coffee People or Amazon, so I guess I'm stuck w/ 50 nasty flavored K-cups.

review/summary: Jet Fuel ok for dark roast
review/text: I tried Jet Fuel after looking at the reviewed on a number of K-cup roasts. I am a home roaster and new to K-cups because we have a Keurig in the office. I also bought a Solofil reusable K-Cup, which works very well. I was concerned that the so called K-Cup dark roasts would be weak and tasteless. I was wrong, in fact the Jet Fuel is a bit over the top dark and very acidic. I would recommend Emril's Big Easy Bold or a Coffee People French Roast for everyday - Jet Fuel is good for an occasional jolt.

review/summary: K-Cup Switch to Coffee People Jet Fuel Proves OK
review/text: My wife and I purchased Timothy's World Coffee, Parisian Nights, Extra Bold K-Cups for over two years and used Amazon's subscription to automatic shipping for the best economy.  It was disappointing to learn a few weeks ago that this particular coffee would no longer be available on the subscription program.  We looked over the list of coffees that would be available and selected Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups because the label and description included "Dark Extra Bold."  We are very satisfied with the new coffee.  It has the strong, rich flavor and aroma we like.  It is difficult to distinguish this Jet Fuel coffee from our old favorite Parisian Nights.  All of the subscription coffees are in boxes of 50 K-Cups which is a little more economical than the former 24 K-Cup boxes.  This savings plus the discount for subscribing to automatic free shipping results in the lowest cost we have found for these K-Cups.

review/summary: It's OK!
review/text: I was researching different flavors and reviews on K Cups. I came across Jet Fuel which was supposed to be one of the "Boldest" K Cups available. They arrived this morning and I could not wait to try them in my machine. I was quite surprised on how not so "Bold" they tasted!<br />I have tried quite a few other brews and I found the "Jet Fuel" to be the same or less "Bold" than the other ones.<br />I would suggest if you are considering this brand due to its "Bold" flavor that you only purchase a small amount first. I purchased 2- 50 count boxes and sure I will use them but I will still use the other brands that seem to be more "Bold" such as "Expresso Roast" and others.

This item isn't it. It was perhaps the most middle of the road, marginal cup I've had in a long time. Little taste, marginally robust, and lots of caffeine. I won't ever buy it again. The Coffee People Black Tiger is a much better product. I also enjoy Emeril's Big Easy Bold....long before this slack waste of time. Save yourself drinking a marginal cup of coffee and try something else.

review/summary: Good coffee, slight problems w/grounds
review/text: In general, I love Coffee People coffee. My only beef with them in general is that I often get coffee grounds in my brewed coffee, and I don't usually have this happen with other brands of K-cups. But it's usually not many; only one or two. My other problem with this particular order was that one of the K-cups was punctured, so my package arrived covered in coffee grounds. But Amazon was very kind about it, and shipped me a replacement quickly. Other than that, though, this is tasty, strong coffee. I just wish they'd put it on Subscribe & Save.

review/text: My husband I both like this coffee.  I use a 3 oz. cup with milk to make a latte.  He makes a 6-8 oz. cup and uses it with half and half. Strong flavor, not bitter. Not as "caramelly" as some we have had, but very good.

review/summary: Excellent Dark Roast
review/text: We recently purchased a Keurig coffee system... and although the convenience is great our initial impression of the brewed coffee was only so-so. That all changed when we tried Jet Fuel by Coffee People. I like my coffee black, rich and extra bold. Jet Fuel is exactly that, not bitter, not burnt, but deeply delicious with a bit of chocolate taste, without being sweet. A perfect wakeup cup - congrats Coffee People for getting it right!!

review/summary: Jet Fuel from Coffee People!
review/text: I tried this product because someone else had said that it was equal to Timothy's Midnight Magic Extra Bold... I am glad I did.  However, I now must get my hands on some TMM because I think I detect a difference, and wish to compare them side-by-side.  Jet fuel is excellent and I think that it has more body to it than does TMM, but I have not had a TMM for a few months now (Costco stopped handling it!)  The taste is very similar to that of TMM.  I think JF gives you that little coffee buzz while TMM does not.

review/text: As like the others have already said, a very delicious, rich, strong coffee that will keep you going all day. It is very good by itself, or with milk, or my personal favorite, some chocolate coffee creamer. I purchased both Jet Fuel and Wake Up call, they are both very smooth and I use them interchangeably The packaging and delivery was top notch, as is usual with amazon. Amazon is the best place to purchase any K-cups as can be found out by price comparison to other retailers.

review/text: This coffee was great...Its like having an espresso coffee. I love my coffee strong and this was it. For some people it may be too strong so use the larger amount of water on your Keurig. My wife love strong coffee as well but it was too strong unless she used the larger amount of water. If you like Spanish like coffee you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Great Coffee, Not so great change in price!
review/text: For those who love bold coffee, Jet Fuel, is for you.  Other brands that offer bold roasts are just not as good.  I am going to see if they sell jet fuel that are not for K-cups also.  When I travel, I do not always have access to a Keurig and have to settle for coffee that is subpar.  My only complaint is the increase in price!  I used to pay $17.83 per month but over the last 3 months the amount has sky rocketed.  Not sure as to why but I imagine it is because of several reasons and one of them is the increase in demand as Jet Fuel is no longer a cult favorite and more people are starting to buy it.  If the price does not decrease I will be forced to cancel my subscribe and save subscription.

review/text: First, you have to like real, bold coffee (which I do) to like this coffee. If you like this coffee, also try Organic, Black Tiger, and Wake Up Call. Each of these is similar but have slightly different tastes. I like to buy them in boxes of 50 using automatic delivery (can't beat the price that way).<br /><br />The coffee tastes great. I would classify it as bold/extra bold. I gave it 5 stars, and I continue to buy it along with the others that I mentioned.

review/text: I gave my wife a Keurig last Christmas but, being a coffee purist, scorned using it. Then one morning I was running later than normal so I borrowed one of her K-cups and had a cup. Not bad but not my cuppa. I was intrigued and shopped around trying different coffees until I hit on the Jet Fuel. Strange name notwithstanding, an excellent cup of coffee. I do occasionally miss grinding and brewing, but this is sooooooo convenient and the coffee isn't bad.

review/summary: Lovely coffee Manufacturing defect causes grounds to pour
review/text: I love the strong but not burnt taste of the Jet Fuel K-cup coffee.  However, about every 3rd or 4th K-cup has an undetectable manufacturing defect. My husband works in manufacturing and compared a proper K-cup with a defective Jet Fuel by dissecting both.  The K-cups have an internal filter but the defective Jet Fuel ones the interior filter is torn around the top edge which then allows a great quantity of coffee grounds to dispense in your cup. Then there is the mess of grounds to clean up in the Keurig coffee maker not to mention that drinking grounds is an experience you want to avoid. It's impossible to tell which Jet Fuel K-cups are fine and which are defective. It's a lovely strong coffee and was actually one of my favorites but I won't be purchasing any more of them because of the defect problem.
