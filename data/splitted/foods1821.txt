review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: I just received my order of 2 12 packs of this stuff here in lovely Kandahar, Afghanistan :) I ordered this to supplement the "wonderful" food that the Army provides here on our outpost. I initially drank one warm, even though it says to chill. There really isn't a big difference, apart from the fact the chilled ones are more refreshing on these hot days. Otherwise, the flavor isn't bad, considering everything they've crammed into this drink. I'd like to try the coffee one eventually, as I enjoy the flavor of coffee more, but it was out of stock when I ordered. Overall, I would say this is a great product, and I will definitely be buying this again. Cheers!!<br /><br />SPC. Greg Najduch<br />ACS 4<br />Kandahar, Afghanistan

review/summary: Can't live without my Orgain!
review/text: I have done MUCH research on different meal replacement shakes and this one hands down stands out from the rest.  The Iced Cafe Mocha flavor is the best!  Over ice, w/ a hint of nutmeg - there is nothing like it.  My husband couldn't believe the ingredients - top notch guys! Keep up the good work : )

review/summary: Orgain Chocolate Meal Replacement Shakes
review/text: Product served over ice or cold tastes very chocolate-like and has the calorie content that it should have for a meal replacement shake. It tastes much better than other meal replacement shakes we have tried, and is helping keep the weight on as we wanted!!  In using the internet to purchase, we have had no trouble receiving the product, and this time it actually arrived one day earlier than scheduled, which was a nice surprise!  We love this product, and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to maintain their weight or who may have trouble eating and needing to replace their caloric intake with a drinkable resource. I highly recommend this to any chocolate lover who needs to drink meal replacement shakes, or for anytime when on the go and needing good nutrition!!

review/summary: Light & Yummy Meal Replacement
review/text: I drink it as a meal replacement for lunch as my lower calorie diet. It's the quickest and easiest lunch, I just take it out of the fridge, chug one and I'm back to work. Probably not the "healthiest" method to losing weight but I find that it keeps me pretty full. Although, I do miss the feeling of chewing something..<br /><br />I'm not a health nut but I'm glad this stuff is made with organic ingredients. Makes me feel better knowing that I'm not drinking artificial junk because who knows what that artificial stuff does to my body.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that it increases my energy but it keeps it stable. And I don't get that food coma feeling afterwards, like I would after eating a heavy lunch.<br /><br />I'd say the Chocolate Fudge is the best flavor. I've tried the Vanilla and Mocha and both of them leave a weird after taste. Honestly, I think the Vanilla tastes like the smell of a butcher shop. =X I went through a whole case of Vanilla and I just couldn't get used to the flavor. The chocolate is creamy with a light fudgey taste and I swear it tastes better the more I drink it.. I must be getting used to the flavor. I've already gone through 3 cases of the Chocolate Fudge and will continue to buy more.

review/summary: Awesome Orgain!
review/text: I saw the Orgain promo at my local vitamin store and asked the sales person about it. After reading the ingredients I decided to try the chocolate. I really liked the taste, the consistency and realized later on that I had no negative side effects afterwards. Sometimes I have difficulty with digestion, burping, bloated feeling. Not with Orgain. I decided to buy a few 12 packs and have my husband try it too.  He's 63 years old, I'm 56. If he's in a rush in the morning, he now drinks his Orgain in the car on the way to the city.  He's a big guy, 6'3" and 275 lbs. He agrees that Orgain is a great way to start the day, replace a snack with Orgain, and feel great. I love the 16 grams of protein. I can go for 4 hours and not feel hungry or like I'm running on empty. I know I'm not missing out on important nutrients that can sustain my aging body. Thanks Orgain!

review/summary: Worth it
review/text: I don't normally write reviews but for Orgain I felt compelled to. I can't stand most meal replacement shakes or protein shakes, because the texture usually seems off to me. When I have the time I use unflavored protein powder in a smoothie, but for days where that's just not possible Orgain has been an excellent substitute. I have tried chocolate and mocha, and both are great tasting. I prefer the mocha because I feel like I'm getting my coffee fix for the day--and though this stuff is caffiene free I feel energized without the jitters! It's a good breakfast, though occassionally I get an upset stomach after drinking it. I haven't been able to pinpoint why, but it's something to keep in mind if you have a sensitive stomach.<br /><br />I also drink orgain on my workout days, half a shake beforehand and the other half afterward. Even though it's expensive, I don't drink it every day, and my monthly subscription for just a 12-pack has done me well for a while now. For me, it's worth the money to have meal replacement that is easy and tasty.

review/text: So if you're worried about getting enough protein but are grossed out by slim fast and the like... these are perfect. The other reviewers aren't kidding when they say it tastes just like chocolate milk. Very tasty, much better than any other protein drink I've tried. Sweet but not too sweet, and very chocolatey. I want to try the vanilla flavor, but I like chocolate so much I'm going to wait until I get sick of these first. TRY THIS! You won't regret it.

review/text: 4/16/12, Monday, New York City<br /><br />Orgain has fit in to my lifelong effort to stay out of doctors' offices. At over 88 I think now I've been doing the job right.  I was health conscious back as early as 1938.  My friends thought I was a health fiend. But I don't care about labels.  Except, of course, superior labels like Orgain's labels that informs us all that this product will help us through life's daily hurdles.  Chill it, taste it and then tell me what you think,  Here's what I think:  It's not a substitute for real food that you eat with a knife, fork, and spoons.  But, it sure does fill the gap between meals and keeps me going both physically and mentally -- knowing that I'm taking care of my health.  Try it, you'll like it enough to be hooked as I am.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FDG4K4">Orgain Creamy Chocolate Fudge, 11-Ounce Container (Pack of 12)</a>

review/text: I recently started dragging myself out of bed at 5 am weekdays to exercise. Since I'm a night owl, this is no easy feat! After my workout, I need something to 'refuel' while getting ready for work. I eat only organic food and tried several types of organic breakfast bars but none gave me the boost I needed. My goal was to find something with a high protein content AND great taste AND no early-morning stomach upset. I found Orgain while searching amazon.com and after reading only a few of the 5 star reviews, I ordered the Creamy Chocolate Fudge.<br /><br />Well, this is IT. Orgain covers all the bases - organic, high protein, balanced nutrition, convenient, gentle on my stomach, and it tastes GREAT. I'm stocking up and will use it post-exercise and also to keep me energized during 50 mile endurance rides on my horse.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how wonderful Orgain is but writing this review has made my mouth water enough that I'm signing off to go have one!

review/summary: A lot to like
review/text: What's really important about Orgain is the fast infusion of protein it gives you when you are really in need of a boost.  It goes to work within a minute.  If you're famished or feel hypo-glycemic, you'll really appreciate having one.<br /><br />The new Mocha flavor is far and away my favorite.  It tastes less sweet and has a subtle coffee taste. It is a pleasure to drink.<br /><br />The only reason I give Orgain 4 instead of 5 stars is because I'd prefer it didn't rely on the 13 grams of sugar it contains.  Sugar just isn't a nutritional plus, and nowadays, with alternatives like xylitol available, there is room to improve this very good product.<br /><br />I've tried other "smoothies" and supplement powders that you add to water, and none of them cut it.  Orgain is the best product of its kind out there.

She commented that they are more than a recovery drink, truly leaving her satisfied like eating a meal. We have tried several organic whey protein shake brands and some of them have such contrived flavors and are a hassle for her as they need shaking with blender ball and then go bad in the clinic fridge if she doesn't have time to eat (very busy doctoral student). She can just leave one or two in the clinic's fridge and she knows she has something instantly available that will sustain her.

I went on a hunt for a nutrition shake with fiber and more natural ingredients in it.  I finally found this one. I have so much more energy on this shake. I'm nursing now and very happy with the amount of protein in the drink.  And on top of it I get my chocolate fix off of the fudge flavor while still losing postpartum weight.  The taste is just okay to me, similar to what other chocolate milk drinks taste like but I am amazed that they cram so many fruits and vegetables into it. You really can't taste them.

review/summary: Best in Blender with Fruit
review/text: Orgain Vanilla just about beats all the competition with one exception: the taste. For a high protein drink that is organic, whey-based, and contains the equivalent of 10 fruits & vegetables, this should be no big deal. I would describe the taste as a mildly sweet drink that has the body of 1% milk. It also contains solids that tend to pool near the bottom of the container (great looking packaging, BTW). However, if you put the drink in a blender and throw in a few raspberries or strawberries, it really improves dramatically. Try it and see!

review/text: I don't frequently manage breakfast during the week. I had been going to a work cafeteria with food of dubious nutritional value and marginal taste. I did not want to use the sugar loaded mainstream meal replacement shakes. Enter Orgain. Yes they are more expensive but to me they are worth it. Super easy to use, great tasting (does not taste sweet at all and after the 2nd or 3rd one taste really good), feeling, and they leave me with good energy.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of though, and I have tried the chocolate fudge and the vanilla is that 2 different packages of vanilla were very lumpy. I contacted Orgain and they said the protein can become somewhat seperated. My wife and I ended up not liking the vanilla. So this is 5 stars on the chocolate fudge only. But Orgain had great customer service. Super fast response time and they said they would send me out a new pack of my flavor choice. We are on our 3rd carton of the chocolate fudge and none of the vanilla problem at all. Just smooth, good tasting, and I feel good about having one.

About a year ago I found this drink. The taste is excellent and it is the healthiest protein / vitamin / mineral drink I have ever found. You do not taste the vitamins or minerals. The drink is so good, I use it as a milk replacement in my cereal and on top of fruit such as blueberries. It also makes a great smoothy mixed with fruit and ice. My who family enjoys this product.

review/text: There use to be this great "meal in a box" energy shake called Sustagen Gold in Australia that I could never find the equivalent of until discovering Orgain.<br />You can tell it's made of good stuff because it doesn't leave that classic High Fructose Corn Syrup aftertaste in your mouth that most packaged drinks do.  And it's instantly satisfying, like all good food is.<br />I use it as my pre-yoga teaching meal - I bounce into Wholefoods next door, grab a vanilla or chocolate fudge Orgain (usually the vanilla) and suck it down as I bolt upstairs to my class.<br />It's utterly perfect for that - when you need fast nutrition sans a lot of digesting!<br />I buy it by the case to save money - and with Amazon and the occasional coupon it works out well under $3.<br />The only problem is restraining myself from drinking more than 1 a day.<br />More than that would require intervention, right?<br />I'd love them to come up with a "Pro" version in a less fancy box, that we can ideally buy by the cartonload for even less (so that yes, I can drink more than 1 a day and legitimize my addiction.) And, as I ride a bike, a powdered version would be great too - although sadly powders never seem live up to the pre-made item, even if you have an industrial blender ...<br />They should also sell this at raves and nightclubs instead of alcohol - you'll dance all night and live longer (my mother and I use to do just that downunder).<br />In short, perfect nutrition in a box.<br />http://galfromdownunder.com/yoga

review/summary: Love!
review/text: I love this drink. It tastes fantastic (the chocolate, anyway, the vanilla - no) and is packed full of ingredients I'm happy to put in my body. On busy busy days (most) I'll have at least one in lieu of grabbing food on-the-go. A lot of the time I will have one for breakfast and another for lunch. I feel great and effortlessly lost weight. My fridge is packed full of them and though they seem pricey, it is a nutrient dense MEAL for less (or the same) as a Starbucks coffee. I nixed that habit and upgraded (majorly) with Orgain. I'm looking forward to trying the coffee flavor but haven't seen it yet. signalreturn@gmail.com

review/text: For several years now, I have searched for a good quality and good tasting protein drink, and was never able to find one until I discovered Orgain Protein Drink.  It does not have the awful taste of whey that every other whey protein has.  I am so pleased to have discovered the Orgain Protein Drink.  I will recommend it to everyone.  Thanks Orgain.

review/text: Hidden behind the creamy vanilla flavor is a healthy organic list of veggies and fruit.  The protein curbs the urge to gag down junk food at work.  Often there is no time for lunch so I enjoy my Orgain and feel good about fueling my body well.  I have even used this one as a base for smoothies and it works great.  My favorite is the creamy fudge, but the sweet vanilla bean is delicious when I don't want chocolate.  Thanks for getting it home for free!

review/summary: Delicious alternative to liquid meals
review/text: I'm an on-the go person, who has never liked breakfast.  Years ago I used Slim-Fast to lose some weight, and developed the habit of a liquid breakfast.  Actually continued Slim fast (or sometimes Ensure) for breakfast for years.  But honestly, recently when I began to think those product really don't fit with my nutrition plan, which is about 99% organic.  I went looking for a better alternative and found this.  Oh my goodness, compared to slimfast, just tastes so much more 'real".  Still fills you up, but also seems to have a better vitamin profile.  This is my breakfast every day!

review/summary: Great product, highly reccomended!
review/text: I have been drinking Orgain pretty much since it was released on the market a couple of years ago and have really enjoyed it. Its a great alternative to all the other nutritional/protein shakes out there since it is all organic. About 4 months ago I started to have one every morning for breakfast since I am always in a rush in the morning. Since then, I have lost over 25 pounds! It is a great way to jump start my metabolism in the morning and has what seem to be the perfect ratio of fat/carbs/protein along with all the vitamins and minerals. Before I started drinking it for breakfast I would be super hungry by lunch time, but now, it holds me over really well and I can be more reasonable with my lunch portions. Overall, great product, highly recommended!

review/text: I love Kona coffee, it has a great flavor unique to its growing conditions. This coffee purports to be Kona, but it really is just a Kona blend. Blends are rarely more than 10% Kona... and this one doesn't even say that.  The flavor is mild, even when using extra grounds. Tastes like cheap coffee.

review/summary: My cats accepted this supplement in their food.
review/text: I bought this because it was kelp based. My cats in the past have rejected food with new things in it. Initially I just sprinkled some on the bottom of their dishes and put their moist food on top of it so they couldn't initally see or smell it, and just at a corner of the dish to give them the option of not eating it. They haven't boycotted any meals and have eaten all their food.<br /><br />To me when I taste this, it has a brief salty taste followed by the mild taste of what a vit e tocopherol smells like, and then tastes of dried herb greens. A very mild tasting formula and easily absorbed into the tastes of their favorite foods. They've been wanting to eat extra food!!! I've used a spray mist water bottle to chase them out of the kitchen and get them to stop begging for extra food I can't afford! :D

review/text: These don't taste like walnuts at all.  They are the whole shell, picked while still soft and green.  The texture, shape, and size are about like a pickled beet.  They are in a simple syrup that the walnuts have marinated in.  They taste like rich spice--as though clove and cinnamon were in there, and something else not quite recongnizable.  Yet there is nothing but walnuts and sugar in there.<br /><br />I never would have thought to try these if my Kroger hadn't given me a sample.  These would be so good on pancakes or waffles, or pureed and used in a million different ways.  So far I've just eaten them out of the jar.  ;)

review/summary: LOVE THEM
review/text: I first bought these preserved walnuts at a local specialty gourmet and wine shop because I was curious having never seen anything like them before. The shop person suggested slicing thinly and serving with cheese and crackers. Both the texture and flavor were unexpected and wonderful. The walnuts look like giant dark olives as they are made from immature green walnuts whose shells are still undeveloped and attached. They have a very interesting texture; not crunchy like a fresh walnut but dense and somewhat juicy from the preserving syrup. Everyone who has tried them at our house has LOVED them. So far I have only served them sliced on a cheese tray but I intend on edging my next Italian Cheesecake with the preserved walnuts diced. There are interesting flavors that dance around on your tongue; kind of cinnamony. I've given jars of these as gifts and they have been well received. I will continue to buy these 3 jars at a time on Amazon as the price is better than my local store but in a pinch would pay the $13 per jar locally if I ran out - they are that good.

review/text: This is the second Green Walnut preserve I bought, in hope of finding "the real thing" that I recently tasted during my trip to Turkey. (The previous one was Green Walnut Preserve (Gradina) 14oz (400g), also sold on amazon). Disappointed again. It's over boiled, does not smell/taste anything like walnuts, and has a very strange tea-like aroma. It's actually produced in New Jersey, not Armenia....<br />Avoid this product, as well as the other preserve I mentioned. If I find the real thing, I will post updates here.

review/summary: A much-missed favorite!
review/text: Last year, my cats and I relocated to Germany. And while my four-pawed trio has generally taken the move in stride and quickly adapted to their new home in a manner that has filled me with new love and admiration for them, there is one item now sorely lacking in their lives: Pounce Tuna Treats! For as long as we've been together (and in the case of the two females, that means their entire life), there has not been a better way to reward them or just show them my affection than by giving them some of these - my cats loved them, and I knew that due to the treats' many healthy ingredients I was actually doing something good for my kitties in addition to making them happy. But Pounce is nowhere to be found on the shelves of German stores! My cats are not generally picky in their food choices; they willingly accept most everything appearing in their food bowls. But they have made it quite clear to me that a decent substitute for Pounce is yet to be discovered. In the meantime, what's a poor cat owner to do???

They do tend to dry out by the time I near the end of the bottle, however. The flip-top lid is very handy. Very nice, inexpensive kitty treats. I have yet to meet a cat that doesn't just love these!

If you're hoping for a caramel frappe to add to your morning or just for a special occasion, this would be a great place to start.

review/summary: Caffe D'Vita Caramel Latte Blended Iced Coffee
review/text: This Iced Coffee is the best!!  I use to buy it at Costco for way more than I bought this box of 6 containers, but I moved to a town that doesn't have a Costco in it and was very unhappy that I wouldn't get to drink this product again.  When I found it on Amazon I was so happy I bought it immedinately.  It have a great texture, real Caramel taste, and very easy to make.  If you love Iced Coffee as much as myself and the flavor of Caramel then you really should try this Coffee and I'm sure you'll like it a lot.

review/summary: This is a very good chili
review/text: This is a very good chili and super simple to make but I only give it 3 stars because I think it is overpriced. The only thing innovative in this products is the small little packet of mixed spices. The rest of whats inside the bag are pinto beans and directions.  Oh and the tabasco sauce tied to the bag. This isn't worth the price to me. That being said....it does make for a neat gift for the person who loves chili. Its kind of like the cookie mix in the jar thing or a basket of treats. Its the presentation you are buying. Except this is chili powder in a cute bag with pinto beans and tabasco sauce. If it sold for less I would probably buy more people this as a winter gift. I know a lot of people that love chili.

review/summary: Crazy Pricing
review/text: The product itself is excellent.  It has a nice rich flavor and a dark color.  However, this is the first time that I've looked at this product on Amazon since I purchased the 12 pack of 1 qt jugs a little over a year ago.  The price may be good in general when compared to other syrups, but the increase in price is a bit cost prohibitive for me now.  When I first purchased it, it was a little over 15 dollars per quart jug.  Now it's over 25 dollars per quart jug.  It's good syrup, but it's not good enough for me to buy it at this price.  I give it four stars  for product quality, but I give it two stars on price.  So three stars overall.

review/summary: Cats run right to you when you shake this bag
review/text: I picked up a bag of these treats at our neighborhood market.  My cats think this is the best stuff on earth.  My little darlings have not enjoyed anything as much as they appear to love these.  The only problem with these treats is that the cats love them so much they sometimes get in little squabbles as each one tries to reach my hand before anyone else can get to the treat.<br /><br />If you want to feed you felines an organic diet, and you want them to eat what you give them this is a great product.  My husband continues to threaten to try one since they are all organic, and a nice mix of food that people would eat.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone with pampered felines.  Mine give these three paws up.

review/summary: Good, not great, alternative to Feline Greenies
review/text: I picked these up along as a replacement for the Feline Greenies that I usually get for our two cats. They swarm on me and attack when I have the Greenies and they do the same with these but they don't seem to enjoy these as much. One of our cats likes them as much as the Greenies but the other one seems indifferent. If you feed them to her directly from your hand she will eat them, otherwise she just lets it sit there on the ground while the the other cat swoops in to try to steal it away. It would be one thing if she were a finicky eater but these are about the only things she doesn't devour upon sight.<br /><br />Besides the taste test, I like the fact that they are big enough to actually force them to chew them. I noticed that our cats would swallow the Greenies in one gulp which seemed to defeat the purpose of the tarter control. With the Purrlicious, they have to chew on them a bit before they swallow. That being said, I am a little disappointed by the lack of feeding directions on the package. The Greenies package tell you exactly how many to feed them but no such info here. I wouldn't be so concerned if the vet hadn't told us that one of our cats needs to lose a pound or two.<br /><br />Overall, these are OK but I don't know whether I'll continue to get them over the Greenies since they are a lot more expensive.

review/text: These Grape Leaves are very thick and veiny and no matter how much you boil them they will not soften.  My mother used to pick grape leaves directly from the vine but only the "young" small leaves, not the old ones because they are tough and difficult to chew.  This jar is full of veiny, large "old" leaves and even after cooking the stuffed leaves for over an hour, they still remained thick and chewy and not easy to cut, even with a knife.  I will never use these again, hopefully other brands are better!!

review/summary: Great Coffee!
review/text: Before trying this coffee, I got the "392" stock number from Whole Foods (Organic French Decaf also), but at $13.99/lb., it was no bargain. This Le Bean product tastes better to me. It's a rich and wonderful blend. The Le Bean is probably the best decaf I've ever tasted. It's rich and smooth. The company clearly cares about producing an excellent product. I look forward to it every day.<br /><br />When I called the company a while back, I found they use a C02 (Carbon-dioxide) process, not a water process for decaffeination. From what I understand, this process, as opposed to the water process, just means it doesn't take out quite as much caffeine as a water process. But I believe the process is just as safe - no chemicals used/added as possible with other decaffeination methods.<br /><br />I had a small issue recently where the 5 lb. bag I ordered felt a bit light. Using a scale I had previously verified using known-good weights, I weighed the bag and found it to be almost a whole pound underweight. Amazon, to their credit, refunded that order immediately upon hearing about this issue. I'm confident this was just an accident, but I'll post back here if it happens again.<br /><br />Finally, 5 lbs. is a lot of coffee. Therefore, I freeze my 5 lb. bag. Although Le Bean apparently does not recommend freezing, I seem to recall reading a book called "The Book of Coffee and Tea" that actually recommended freezing to maximize the length of freshness (6 months frozen in bean if memory serves). Moreover, I taste no difference between the beginning of the bag and the last beans after the bag has been in the freezer for months. Your experience (or taste buds) may be different.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Update: The most recent order I got had the correct weight of coffee so I'm confident that the initial experience I listed above has been resolved....now better quality control before the coffee goes out to make sure the weight is correct. THANK YOU Le Bean for fixing this under-weight issue so quickly!!! :)

review/summary: Good coffee, but caffeine content is pretty high
review/text: I found this bean to produce tasty coffee (I've been cold brewing it for iced coffee), but was rather surprised at how much caffeine is still in the bean, despite its "decaffeinated" status.  I am very sensitive to caffeine (my heart races and I feel very physically shaky and anxious from it), and I get this response from this bean.  Just FYI for those who have the same sensitivity.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just want to reinforce the message here that the caffeine content in this bean remains high.  It seems to me that this is a caffeinated coffee, though I believe them when they say it is decaffeinated (I believe it is decaffeinated, but not uncaffeinated).  I have been really struggling with the caffeine in this coffee (suffering caffeine's effects on my body), because I have so much of this bean (purchased 5 pounds) and I like the coffee.

If I can find this at a decent price, I will be buying more of it for myself. Sorry, Amazon, but $35 for four 12-ounce jars is NOT a decent price, not even with free Prime shipping. Not even close!

I was hoping the "nut" was a walnut, pecan, or almond (or all of the above!), but it's merely an unimpressive sliver of regular old peanut. After I got done picking the hard cranberries out of my teeth, I decided I would never by this flavor of overpriced, disappointing peanut-butter again.

review/text: Colavita Olive Oil is excellent.  It is manufactured in Italy with Italian olives.  It is a cold-pressed oil, meaning the olives are crushed without use of heat or chemicals.  No heat, of course, means more nutrients; No chemicals, of course, is no chemicals!!  I use this oil in my cooking (red sauces), sauteing vegetables, fish, meats, in salads, and for dipping with bread and freshly ground pepper or a cheese--such as Parmigiano Reggiano or Pecorino Romano.  My favorite use of this oil is in traditional Italian Bread Salad (Panzanella).  Amazon's price, however, is quite high $36.99!!  I get it locally for $26.99.  Of course, I have the benefit of living in the Chicago area, where excellent Italian products are available.  If you consider the cost of shipping a 3L can, then amazon's price (with the retailer's shipping) is competive!

They're good to place in where you sleep for a healthier air exchange according to a website "top indoor plants for air purification". Since oxygen is highly required for recovering process during beauty sleep rejuvenation, they recommend about 6 plants per person for its optimal effect. I'm not sure of the size, however, according to NASA a human requires 6 waste tall plants (particularly carbon monoxide (human exhale) to oxygen converting) to "survive" in the room completely sealed from air. Note that it's to survive, not for optimal oxygen saturation, though that wasn't mentioned on that page. Didn't mean to change the subject, but that was the reason why I purchased these plants from this seller other than a high quality service and quick shipment that I truly appreciate.

review/text: My plant arrived in good condition.  It is full and healthy looking.  There were some brown tips on some of the stems, but the plant looks good after clipping those off.  I believe that is customary for the snake plant (mother-in-law's tongue) though.  I am pleased with the plant.

review/summary: WAAY overpriced compared to local grocery
review/text: I love Anna's Ginger Thin cookies, and was hoping to find them through Amazon<br />in quantity for a discount bulk price.  But this price for an 8-pack is more<br />than double the per-pack I pay at my expensive gourmet grocery store in NYC.<br />I am very disappointed that Amazon can't find a decent supplier at a sane price.<br />Guess I might go for it if I was marooned on a desert island, but, otherwise, FUGETTABOUTIT!

review/summary: Delicious! Vegetable Enhancer!
review/text: I received my first bottle of this Viking Smoked Salt as a stocking stuffer. I like to cook and I started using it w/everything! I feel this really enhances the flavor of the veggies. It is especially delicious on roasted vegetables.<br /><br />1. Turn oven on to broil.<br />2. Prepare a baking pan with foil.<br />3. Lay out my veggies (asparagus, brussel sprouts, broccoli, etc) in a single layer.<br />4. Douse with extra virgin olive oil (evoo).<br />5. Sprinkle liberally with Viking Smoked Salt.<br />6. I sometimes add ground black pepper and ground garlic.<br />7. I leave the veggies in there till they start to get golden brown but I really like them kinda charred... About 8-14 mins.<br /><br />I have also used in sauteing vegetables (mushrooms, green beans, brussel sprouts, etc)<br /><br />1. Turn on stove to a medium high fire.<br />2. Prepare a large frying pan with evoo (just enough to cover the expanse of the pan).<br />3. When oil starts to separate, drop in vegetables.<br />4. Coat veggies w/oil from pan (add more if needed). I also sometimes add a few pats of butter for taste.<br />5. Sprinkle with Viking Smoked Salt.<br />6. Keep mixing the veggies.<br />7. I turn off the fire when the veggies are al dente(still a little bit crisp) but that is up to you...
