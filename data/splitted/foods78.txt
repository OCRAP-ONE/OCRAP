review/summary: Chia--great for cholesteroal
review/text: I have had persistently high cholesterol for years.  Allergic to statins, zetia made me sick--nothing pharma came up with worked for me (I am a workout fiend and half vegetarian).  My total cholesterol was always 220 or higher.  After one month of chia powder, it was at 187.  Nearly miraculous!

review/summary: Don't Buy -- Dreadful!
review/text: I like Japanese soups and just love the similar products from San-J (also available from Amazon -- get those, they're 5-star!).<br /><br />This Miso-cup brand is terrible. I can't tell you more than this is just yicky. I wish there was a zero-star rating!<br /><br />I didn't finish the first cup even (but I'd already tried and re-tried another Miso-cup flavor and hated it). Therefore, I only used one envelope before giving away the rest. Oh, why did I stray from San-J? Actually, I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cup's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience. It was this flavor, in particular, that I was most interested in trying for variety. But now I know that ALL the Miso-cup brand are equally dreadful!!!<br /><br />I gave these and the other Miso-cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them. Get the San-J brand!!!

review/summary: jablum dont buy it
review/text: My son had this Jablum roasted and ground coffee brought back from Jamaica and paid a lot for it.  I have drunk blue mountain for years when I can but this was shocking.  It tasted stale when you opened the bag and even worse when you drank it.  It was definitely off.  He bought 5 bags and every one we tried was the same.  I would never buy another.  We had bought another brand in a tin from Jamaica which was fine.  I think this is a con.  You get all the rubbish about it being tested in Jamaica, well I dont know who tests it but definitely not someone who likes good coffee.  I just dont understand how people say its any good. Maybe having paid so much for it its like the emperor's new clothes.

review/summary: Excellent coffee, not all that exotic, though...
review/text: I love my coffee, and because of that, I have tried lots and lots of varieties although I began as a simple Folgers fantatic.  Jamaican Mountain Blue Coffee has been touted to be the best of the best world coffees out there by such highly esteemed sources as the Food Network and the kitchens of the White House.<br /><br />I found the low acidity of the coffee very refreshing, but the darkness of this roast has not allowed a lot of subtleness of the flavor to come out.  To me, this tastes like Folgers at its best, but nothing more than that.  Great for everyday drinking, because it is smooth and rich and leaves little acid "bite."  But still, after having tried Kona coffee with its myriad of subtle flavors, I found Blue Mountain kinda boring.<br /><br />I guess I disagree with experts, but hey, my coffee is important and taste is everything!  If you like exotic flavors, this isn't it.  But it you would like to have consistently smooth, rich, honest coffee, this is the one.

review/text: While in Jamaica, my wife and I drank Blue Mountain Coffer every day and loved it.  We even went on a bike tour of the Blue Mountains, and purchased some coffee.  It came in a plain clear plastic bag, and we could see the darkness of the roast.  We enjoyed that coffee.<br /><br />In Ocho Rios, we bought some bags of JABLUM.  You can't see the darkness of the roast, and all you can smell is the burlap bag.  When we opened it up, it was a very light roast, not much fragrance, and once brewed, the coffee tasted a lot like dirt.  We were very disappointed.

review/text: You watch your mouth!<br /><br />Simply, one of the best things I have ever eaten. Healthy organic blue corn chips with taste that packs a punch.<br /><br />I won't waste your time reading about these when you can be enjoying them instead. Just note that some bags seem to have a more generous allotment of cayenne pepper (the special ingredient that distinguishes Red Hot Blues from the standard Blue Chips). Or perhaps certain bags settle more during shipment, in which case the bulk of the cayenne dust is to be found at the bottom of the bag. You can always scoop up the loose seasoning and sprinkle on the chips (or any food! LOL) as you see fit.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon needs to figure out how to share reviews across products. In this case, for example, there are at least four different listings for Red Hot Blues. The only difference is the size of the bag or the quantity of bags that are bundled together. I am posting this review in those as well because other than one listing, none of the others have any reviews. Hopefully this will be of some help to customers, plus point them toward the main listing (the one with Free Shipping and sold directly from Amazon!).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQYW0E">Garden of Eatin'� Tortilla Chips Red Hot Blues, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

I know it says that upon further review but I was assuming it was the 3lb size because that size is $3.99 at the grocery.  And I just paid the same thing for the 1lb size?!  Shame on you Amazon.  Or better yet shame on me.  The expiration date is fast approaching too so I'm not even sure I'll use these up in a month.  I was very disappointed in the price as well as the expiration date.  I had the same issue with some sunflower seeds I bought recently, they expired before baseball season even started.  However, I did get what I paid for...it's just my mistake for not realizing the size was not what I thought I was getting.  Who would pay that for the 1lb size?

review/text: Great product, I never cook this in the microwave because sometimes it takes longer and not all microwaves are the same.  I've read people reviews and they said there were small brown pieces that were hard, that means they were not cooked long enough.  The best way to cook these are to use a medium size pan, pour the pack into the pan and shake it around and bake them in the oven @ 400 degrees for 4-6 minutes, keep a close eye on them because they burn easy.  But it is worth it to cook it in the oven, very hot and fresh and no uncooked curls.  They will appear to be brown at first but they "poof" up in the oven once they're heated.  I would say do not microwave these in a bag, use a oven safe plate, that way you can actually see them puff up, older/cheap microwaves can take 4-6 minutes to cook.

review/summary: Pretty good, but I am not sure that I will buy again
review/text: It was quite a commitment for me to buy this quantity of pork rinds from Amazon but I decided that I would "give it a go" since I like the pork rinds that are sold in grocery stores and I figured that these could only be better since they'd be fresher when microwaved.  They taste great and I think that they have the perfect amout of spice.  HOWEVER, two things....the smell is "funky" when they come out of the microwave.  Regardless of the taste, I can't seem to get used to the smell.  Secondly, when it comes to popcorn, I have to pop popcorn less than the directions on the package in my microwave or it will burn.  I found it to be the opposite with these pork rinds.  I had to cook the port rinds LONGER than the directions say on the package, otherwise they wouldn't be popped nicely and were a bit chewy.  So if you find that you cook these and they don't seem crispy enough, cook them in your microwave longer than the directions say to do so.

review/summary: Great item
review/text: I was never a big fan of pork rinds. But since I started doing Atkins, I was buying them sometimes to fill that desire for a crunchy, salty snack.  I ended up only buying the hot variety since it seemed to cover the taste of the rinds better than plain or bbq.  After reading the reviews here, decided to give these a try.<br /><br />I had never had anything other than the bagged variety of pork rinds.  As others have mentioned here, these are far superior to anything you will find in a bag.  Way, way better than any bagged variety I have sampled.  Plus the make this great popping, crackling noise when you take them out for a minute or so that I greatly enjoy for some reason.<br /><br />Do mind the cooking instructions.  If you overcook, they will end up tasting closer to the bagged taste you are trying to avoid.  Still better than bagged though.  I tried different times in my microwave but found it best to watch and take them out as soon as the bag stops rising.  You will sometimes have some that did not expand(you can pop these back in the microwave to try and revive them) but it is not worth burning some of them to try to ensure all have expanded.

review/text: I am on a low carb diet, so pork rinds were a natural. I bought the Hot and Spicy.  These are great, they taste better than any others that I have tried from the stores.  The package says less than a carb per serving (there are 3.5 servings per 1.75 Ounce package).  I would like to know how many carbs for a full package, because I often eat more than one serving.  Give these a try, they are awesome.

review/summary: Pork rind magic!
review/text: These are magical. Put them in the microwave and they literally pop into a fresh hot crackly bag of pork rinds. They're a little on the salty side but no more so than most of the pork rinds you buy in the store. Each bag fills up a large cereal bowl. Good for a little snack when you need it and you don't want popcorn.

review/summary: A for freshness, but d*mn are they salty.......
review/text: I was so excited to see these! And the price is good.<br /><br />First, it takes a little learning to figure out how to cook these. The instructions are not much help. "Stop cooking when the bag stops expanding"....they might as well say, perform a Vulcan mind meld with the pork rinds to know when they are done. I found that the bag's expansion--or not---has little to do with whether they are done. I have a 1200 watt microwave and 1:30 was perfect. 1:00 and they were not cooked, 2:00 and I had charcoal bits.<br />I had to sacrifice a couple of precious bags to figure this out.<br /><br />Taste and texture? Well they are infinitely better than bags of pork rinds from the store. The texture is very good. The taste? I am in no way shy of salty food, love me some salt! But these were borderline too much for me. I did sprinkle some cinnamon and Ideal on them to make them sweet and I still had a hard time eating them. My husband liked them this way though.<br /><br />If they could back off the strong salty flavor, I would buy these again. As it is, I'm going to use them to make low-carb nachos. I won't be reordering them though. Love the crispy texture! But can't choke down the overpowering saltiness.

review/text: taste is not like other pork rinds.  but does not taste bad.  when you microwave them, the bag only pops up about half way.  when its done popping and you eat them immediately, they are pretty hot and seem to melt in your mouth.  needing much water and a brushing to get the rinds and the taste out of your mouth afterwards.  I think the idea is pretty good, but the product did not turn out how they expected in my opinion.

review/text: These are an okay snack. They don't puff up like the Pork Rinds I have had in the past. The quantity of rinds in the bag seems lacking. There is a unusual taste as if some type of seasoning added that I can't figure out. If you want a salty snack with no carbs they are okay, I, however, will not buy them again. I'll stick with the regular puffed up ones or cracklings. These don't fit in either category quite the way I expected.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UP8QQ0">Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds, Hot & Spicy, 1.75-Ounce Packages (Pack of 18)</a> In order to appreciate the taste of a "fresh" Pork Rind, head to a Meat Market that has them.  There is no comparison to that "Rind", with the "traditional" store version.(Bagged)  Lowrey's Microwave Pork Rinds came along and created the perfect answer and a new experience for true Pork Rind Fans!! Usually, each bag will create 11 to 15 Large pieces, and some smaller bites.  The best way to eat them is immediately after removing them from the Microwave, when they are Hot and Chewy. (Cook Times Vary: 2:15 min./sec. for me) Airtight package when it arrives, and is not too spicy for those Non-Chili eaters.  They were sold in stores up until 2 years ago, and may still, but Amazon is the only place I know that has them when you want them.  Every bag is seal wrapped and can be stored like popcorn, so no need to keep the box! If anything, the novelty of this product will break the ice of any party or gathering.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Snap crackle and pop of pork rinds
review/text: Few things are as enjoyable in life as freshly popped pork rinds.  Modern technology has enabled us to produce the epitome of snack foods in a hot, fresh version.  I will be relegated no more to the listless depths of popped corn.  Pork rinds are the ultimate man chips. Very similar to microwaved popcorn, you just shake the bag and put em in your microwave for about 2 min and voila, hot fresh pork rinds.  When you pop them you have to get accustomed to the fact that they don't "pop" like popcorn - they just crackle a bit.  So it is a bit hard to tell when they are done and usually through trial and error you will get the perfect time depending upon the type of microwave oven you use.  Mine is 900W and takes just under 2 min. A couple of pieces will get burnt, or as I affectionately refer to as char. The bag will inflate slightly.  When they are done, you open it up and you are greeted with an aroma that is bacon heaven.  Put one in your mouth right away and it will stick to your tongue like a live octopus.  They are a bit salty so they make the perfect accompaniment to a nice cold beer.  I didn't find them too spicy, just enough.  If you want to be creative, you can throw em in a bowl right after they are done popping and throw some salsa verde or any other kind of salsa you have.  You will be greeted with a chorus of wonderful snaps like getting sizzling rice soup at a Chinese restaurant.  Throw on some shredded cheese and the result is "man nachos".  My wife thinks that it is utterly disgusting, even though that hasn't stopped her from eating them.  Trust me, they are delicious, but don't let em sit too long or they get soggy.

review/summary: Practical and delicious. However, has preservatives!
review/text: These chicharrones are delicious, and the packaging is very convenient.  Just like microwave popcorn, the pork rinds come in a bag with cellophane around it.  You shake the bag to distribute the pork rinds, pop it in the microwave, and set the cooking time.<br /><br />The optimal time for my microwave is one minute 45 seconds, but the time will likely differ from one microwave to another.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this product five starts is due to the MSG listed as an ingredient.  While I don't react badly to MSG it still makes me a little nervous.<br /><br />If you're on a low-carb diet this is a great choice for snacking or even meal replacement.

review/text: I am doing the Atkins program for weight loss, and I was missing crunchy, crispy things. Celery just doesn't get it. Our local stores don't regularly carry pork rinds, so I was feeling a little bit left out.<br /><br />But, the Lowry's brand is one I am familiar with and so, I was pretty confident I would like them. They don't pop like popcorn; in fact, they don't make much noise at all when they are cooking. I've found that one minute forty eight seconds seems to be the best time to get the most edible rinds. BUT....one can also reheat the unpopped rinds and a lot of them will then puff up.<br /><br />Enjoy...they are worth it.

review/text: Unlike microwave popcorn, you cannot hear the pork skins cooking, so only by trial and error and the wattage of your microwave will you know how long to cook these. Cooked to the proper timing, they will be fluffy, melt in you mouth. 15 seconds too long you will have a stinky unedible product.<br />It is something that you must try. I cooked mine for 1 minute 45 seconds and they were not all done. I do not know the wattage of my microwave.<br />So try them for your self. As I said, they are different than popcorn, but have the same results if left too long in the micowave, stinky.

review/text: I love reading reviews about the smell.  Have you really though this through.  We are taking pork rind pellets, and microwaving them till they expand.  It's frankly amazing they don't smell worse.  Beyond the smell of cooking rind (which I don't mind by the way), these snacks are great.  It took us a two bags to figure out the cook time.  To little and you don't get full expansion, to much and they get hard, I mean real hard.  For us it is 1 minute 30 seconds to perfection every time.  I really like the seasoning as well.  I don't find it offensively over board or chemically.  Basically it is a simple snack.

review/text: Calling these "Bacon Curls" is a bit of a stretch, but they are in fact tasty pork rinds. I am fairly certain only bacon can be bacon.

review/summary: PORK RINDS
review/text: I ordered the pork rinds as a Christmas gift for my father in law. (He is one who has everything, and if you buy him anything, he will put it up.)Then I ordered some for my husband, needless to say I took some to work with me. We all have fallen in love with them. During this time, I have contacted the grocery store and they have now put them in their store, for everyone to purchase and enjoy.

review/summary: Perfect When You Want A Low Carb Snack
review/text: These taste great and if you don't cook them all the way the tiny bits of pork rinds stay crunchy and hard (Which I love!)<br />It's very reminiscent of porchetta skin.<br /><br />I keep a case of these at work and one at home. That way I have a quick snack at the office and a nice substitute for popcorn at home. Honestly these taste better than any popcorn I've ever had. If you are on a ketogenic diet these are a must have.

review/summary: Best Pork Rinds Available
review/text: These microwave pork rinds are absolutely the BEST available. Any bag of pork rinds you buy in a store are not as good. The only place I've seen their equal is the ones that are cooked fresh at fall festivals and such places. They are EXCELLENT. Do not overcook them or they will burn and be lousy. If done properly, they are the best.

review/summary: The Microwave Pork Rinds Are Surpisingly Fantastic
review/text: I have not had pork rinds in more than 20 years and thought that this would be fun to try but I didn'nt have high expectations. Microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success. However, I had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn.  Well it does.  I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago), however, the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted, these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job.<br /><br />It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave.  I have also found that 2 mins 30 seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds.<br /><br />I have eaten 9 bags of the pork rinds and I love them.  They are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn.  And each bag is only 1 carb.

review/summary: I Love Salt, So I Love These
review/text: Okay, first of all I accidentally ordered two boxes of these, so I am now the proud owner of way more pork rinds than anyone should have in the house. Luckily, they are pretty darned delicious. I microwaved mine for almost two minutes (because my microwave isn't the most powerful machine out there), and what resulted were hot, crispy, puffy pork rinds that taste like they should be way worse for you than they are (I mean, they're not great for you, but come on, they're pork rinds). They are quite salty, but I'm a salt fanatic, so that's a-okay in my book. Anyway, I recommend. Just don't order two boxes, or you'll be stuck wondering if microwave pork rinds are an acceptable Christmas gift. . . .

Plus, cooking them in the microwave, just like microwavable popcorn, is a breeze.  I store them in the freezer, along with my popcorn, to keep them fresh.  There is only 1 carb per bag, which makes a perfect snack for my diabetic lifestyle.

review/text: I'm diabetic and manage my weight and blood sugar levels medicine free with a low carb diet.  They don't sell these anywhere I've seen locally but in the "south" I would think they would be a hit!  They're a good product and blow away any already prepared pork rinds and if you're on a low carb diet it's really hard to find a crunchy snack and these fit the bill!  They are flavorful and tender yet crisp.  Thumbs up.

review/text: I've been low-carb dieting and I like pork rinds so I couldn't wait to try these. They're not really "spicy", they're more like mild in my opinion. They are good, they taste just like the pork rinds that you buy at the store, not "bacon-y" at all to me. The only downside is that your house will smell like hot pork rinds. It's pretty bad, I don't normally notice things like that but it's pretty smelly and hard to get rid of.

They're too salty, have a hideous flavor, taste nothing like pork rinds. They don't even taste as good as _bad_ pork rinds. They're also loaded with chemicals I want to avoid (probably part of the source of the hideous flavor).

review/text: These are so good, especially when they are still hot.  I love the way they still sizzle and pop while eating.  Sometimes I sprinkle some hot sauce on mine straight from the microwave or a little parmesan cheese, depending on my mood.  However I eat them, they are really good.  Remember to shake them well for a minute or two before nuking them.  The bags do not puff up as much as microwave popcorn, so don't expect them to.  Only cook for the suggested time on the bag.

review/text: I have ordered about 6 boxes to date, I have only had a few times that they seemed salty, I think the shaking of the bag helps much on this. You also have to watch your own Microwave as to the time needed to cook, do not over cook them or they will burn and become hard. I like to dip in Vineger as well after cooking.(You hear the SNAP CRACKLE POP)Some like hot sauce on it too.<br />I found these in a food store the first time and I bought them as a joke, but after the first bag I was hooked! I'm glad Amazon has them because I can not find any local stores that sell them anymore.<br />I myself prefer the original flavor but this is more of a personal taste then anything else, many of my friends liked the Spicy. you have to love the warm Rinds.

review/summary: Hot and Fresh !
review/text: If you enjoy pork rinds you are going to love this product. Hot and fresh pork rinds beat the socks off any of that bagged stuff from the grocery store that taste like steyrofoam packing peanuts. These little gems cook up light and crispy right from the microwave. They have a mildly spicy flavor that builds up as you make way through the serving but the heat never gets too powerful. The key to getting the best yield is to shake the bag before cooking. That will distribute the pellets evenly. Then you have to find the "sweet spot" for cooking time. Mine is 2 min 30 sec which leaves me with no burnt or uncooked pieces. I only have two minor criticisms: 1) The serving size is a little small and 2)the spice mixture is a tad bit too salty for me. Otherwise, these things are tops !
