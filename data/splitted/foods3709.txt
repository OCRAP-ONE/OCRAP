review/text: This is my second time buying this sampler.  I think it offers a great variety.  There is enough that I can have the drops at my desk at work and the pops at home for my kids.  The flavors are all very good.  I especially enjoy the root beer and lemon drops.

review/summary: Awesome Flavors without the crap!
review/text: We purchased the mixed variety for our children's pinata, wanting to avoid the crap additives that one finds in the store candy. We've known about Yummy Earth lollipops for some time, but in the basic flavors. Finding these were great! My husband and I snuck a flavor of each drop and lollipop prior, just to taste and have since purchased more of our favorite flavor (root beer, so much better than the A&W barrels, in my opinion). They are still sweet, so if you are trying to go for less sugar, that won't work. But if you hate food coloring either out of knowledge or child having reactions (our first son), this is the way to go! These also got us to try interesting flavors (Chili Lime, I admit, I was scared, but I enjoyed it)that you can't find in store candy since supposedly children only like strawberry, cherry, lemon, grape, and orange (as evidenced by lack of more variety).

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I found these while I was looking up some other products. They sounded interesting, so I decided to give them a try.  I've only made it through about half of the flavors in this sampler set, but so far I am enjoying them greatly.  The fruit flavors are zippy and last to the end of each item (pop or drop).  I think my favorite so far is still the Cheeky Lemon drops - the first ones that I tore into.  ~grin~  Although, the Mango Tango is giving it a lot of competition for my taste buds.<br /><br />These candies actually have a lot less sugar than I had figured, but taste wonderful.  When you look at the number of sugar grams on the label, remember to divide by the number in the serving size (5 for the drops; 3 for the pops).

review/summary: Excellent selection of a wonderful product!
review/text: So first I tried the pops which were wonderful so I decided to try this variety pack to decide what flavors I really liked and wanted to get a full order of.<br /><br />The hot chili pops -<br />...The chili-lime is *phenomenal*...think lime with a kick!<br />...The chili-mango is not nearly as good - the mango doesn't meld as well with the spice of the chili.<br /><br />The fruit pops, vitamin c pops and drops and strawberry smash:<br />...The Sour Apple Tart is wonderful, some have commented "wow this is tart" but it's not like the sour apple neon green you get in other mixtures... you can taste the apple as well as the sour<br />...Tooberry Blueberry is the best in the whole bunch. Smooth and tangy and fruity without being sour. Extremely popular.<br />...Wetface Watermelon is my second favorite in this bunch, just tart enough with a lot of watermelon flavor<br />...Other flavors such as pomegranate pucker, strawberry smash, and razzmatazz raspberry are quite good and actually taste different from each other.<br /><br />The Ginger Zest is a little too sweet and doesn't have as much kick as I'd hoped.<br /><br />The Wild Peppermint is as strong as altoids but with a starlight mint texture.  Perfect!<br /><br />Haven't yet made it to the lemon drops or the rootbeer drops.  Will update once I have.  ***edited to add: lemon drops are awesome!  very sour and lemony.  They are my second favorite next to the wild peppermint.  The rootbeer drops are too sweet, similar to the ginger they were more sweet than flavorful.<br /><br />Great company with a great tasting product!  Highly recommend.

review/text: I got this for the candy dish at work, since it seems to be a requirement to have candy at the front desk. I try to avoid corn syrup and artificial everything, so was excited to find a candy that fit. To top it off the flavors are great! I wanted to try the sampler to see what flavors people liked best. So far every flavor is liked a lot. I'm not even a big fan of hard candy and I really like them, especially the pepper ones!

review/summary: Really geared toward kids
review/text: I had seen alot of good reviews on this candy but couldn't decide on which "awesome" flavor to try-i was leaning towards the peppermint. So glad i didn't or else i would've had to give away . I bought this sampler-so far the only one i'm really liking is the ginger zest candy drops.The peppermint drops are SO strong-one drop is like holding 20 altoids in your mouth at the same time-very unpleasant. It is so strong that every time you would open your mouth to talk,you would be able to freshen everyone elses breath around you-maybe a good candy to take to the office. I was very disappointed in the lollipops-they are small-thats not the problem-problem is the taste-one bag says super sour-ok so that one pkg is a given that they are all super sour. However on the bags not marked that the candy is sour-well it is so i think if the candy is sour then it should say that on the pkg.Watermelon is a very sweet fruit-however the watermelon lollipops are a little sweet with a SOUR tang to them. The hot chili pepper lollipops don't seem that hot --until you swallow the juices from it.The rootbeer drops are good but they taste like the rootbeer candy you can already find at the stores. I would NOT buy this sampler again-too bad halloween is not around the corner or i would be handing this out to the trick or treaters. I would buy the ginger zest again. One thing on the size of the candy drops-they are extremely small and i would not give them to little kids because they could easily choke on them-i'm looking at the pkg of the ginger zest and am surprised that there is no warning on the pkg about a choking hazard.If i could i would give 5 stars on the ginger zest but since i can't-i will give 2 stars-1 star for the sampler option & 1 star for the ginger zest.

review/summary: A Candy Lover Who Wasn't That Impressed
review/text: After all the hype and my needing my sweets to come a little healthier I finally gave in and bought this assortment.  I was disappointed.  Of all the flavors I only liked the rootbeer drops and the spicy mango & spicy lime suckers.  I kind of liked the sour apple but there was only ONE.  Lemon, ginger and watermelon were just okay but the lemon was the only true tasting of the latter three.  Several flavors were just unpleasant (or had an off aftertaste i.e. blueberry) and it was strange how there were the most of those flavors..quite the over-abundance in fact.<br /><br />Most were either too tangy/sour, bland or I didn't like the "off" flavor.  The drops are so tiny, You have to eat several to take care of a craving.<br /><br />After 3 teenagers and I tried every flavor and finished off the 3 favorites the rest are sitting in the box untouched and won't be finished for a long time.<br /><br />I guess I'm the odd man out for not liking these (looking at all the high ratings that sucked me into buying these things in the first place...) but it's an honest opinion.  I won't be repurchasing.

The flavors are intriguing but the candies just don't taste very good.  I wish I could report that I loved them.  They have a sticky texture rather than a smooth hard candy feel...maybe the batch I got were old.  I'm disappointed and I have loads of this candy leftover because I bought the 12-count sampler.

review/summary: My favorite gum &lt;3
review/text: When im stressed (which is quite often) I go through packs of gum like a chain smoker goes through cigarettes (no offense intended) so after a while most gums' flavors get pretty old. So far ive been chewing this gum on & off for years, & I have yet to get sick of it. The flavors great: not too sweet or sour & isnt overly watermelony. Most of the other 5 fruit gums im not very fond of or they taste awful to me, but I really believe that this is their best gum yet. My only complaint is that the flavor isnt as long lasting as I would like.<br /><br />If you like fruit flavored gum or are normally a mint gum person wanting to try something different I highly recommend this!

This gum is $1.50 a pack at the grocery store so to get it for this price delivered to your front door is a great deal! It is a great texture and I find the flavor to be long lasting. It is just SO strong when you start chewing it that I find myself chewing piece after piece so I can enjoy that initial burst of flavor! Love it!!

review/summary: very good rice -- dress it up or eat it as is
review/text: I love Near East products.  Their rice pilaf and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZY8W0">Near East Original Couscous Mix, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> are amazing. I like to pair this rice with sauteed green beans or broccoli and soup.  I also occasionally top this rice with sauteed teriyaki mushrooms and seiten.  When cooked, a box of this rice provides at least three generous sized portions.  When paired with other items, you've got a great meal.<br /><br />At the time of this review, Amazon did not list the product ingredients.  Here they are: parboiled long grain rice, orzo, salt, yeast extract, onions, garlic, tumeric.<br /><br />The orzo adds some contrasting texture to the long grain rice.  The turmeric adds a bit of color that is visually appealing.  The spices are perfect and not overpowering.  All in all, this is a simple rice that holds its own at the dinner table.<br /><br />This product contains wheat.

review/summary: Easy and tasty!
review/text: Surprisingly good -- I use this with linguine or angel hair pasta to create a tasty side dish to go with grilled scallops or salmon. I use just a little less oil than called for, and it works just fine. Just follow the directions on the package, and you can't go wrong. Each packet makes 2 servings, so it's perfect for singles or empty nesters.<br /><br />It's not too salty -- a big problem with a lot of things like this -- and the sun dried tomato flavor comes through loud and clear. Amazon's price is very reasonable, too.<br /><br />Here's another use: it makes amazingly good stuffed portobello mushrooms! Very easy -- here's what you need for 4 servings:<br /><br />1 lb of Italian sausage, casings removed (I use good very lean sausage that I order online from a place near Hermann, MO)<br />1/4 C dried bread crumbs (I use plain bread crumbs, NOT the seasoned ones)<br />1 envelope Mayacamas Dried Tomato pasta mix<br />4 medium-large (4" or so) portobello mushrooms, cleaned, with stems removed and finely chopped (remove gills and discard)<br />2/3 C shredded mozzarella cheese, divided.<br /><br />In a bowl, mix sausage, bread crumbs, Mayacamas mix, chopped mushroom stems, and 1/3 C of the cheese until well blended.<br />Spray mushrooms with non-stick spray and place "hollow side up" in a shallow lighly greased (I use non-stick spray) baking pan.<br />Divide sausage mixture among the 4 mushroom caps, packing it into the hollow left by the removal of the gills and stems.<br />Top with the remaining 1/3 C shredded cheese, distributing it evenly over caps.<br />Bake at 325 for 30-40 minutes. Test for doneness with a meat thermometer - filling is done when it registers 165 degrees. Cool slightly; serve with garden salad and breadsticks. Enjoy!!<br /><br />I've been using this stuff for over a year, a couple of times a month or so.  Really, really tasty!

Shipping cost more than the product, so if you are a frugal person, you would not want to do this. But, if you want an outstanding tasting hot tomato sauce that will make award winning chilli...then by all means order a can of this product!<br /><br />The vendor ships right away and the packaging is outstanding.

review/text: A colleague from the UK recommended I try shortbread during a trip to Scotland "as they don't know how to make them 'right' anywhere else apparently." With some reservation (I like baking, pastries, and cookies but haven't had a shortbread cookie I've liked yet), I bought a box and brought them home. My only MAJOR regret was that I did not bring a case home.<br /><br />These are without a doubt the most delectable, soft, flakey, gentle, sweet cookies/dessert/shortbread, I have ever had. Absolutely delicious with a cup of hot tea (recommend heather or thistle tea of the same Scottish flair, also Darjeeling works well). I did try a few other brands whilst in Edinburgh (Nairns - chunky, butterfilled, hard and rather gross. Walkers.. so-so). But this, this is the best of the best!

Any torque (rotational force) placed on the ring may cause it to separatefrom the lid.<br /><br />When cooking with the coddler, do not screw the lid on very tightly. A loose turn is sufficient.<br /><br />When storing coddlers for extended periods of time, it is best to keep the lid attached to the coddler as loosely as possible ... this will help avoid fusing if there is much humidity in the air.

review/summary: Not very well made
review/text: The lids for these egg coddlers are poorly made. Its difficult to get them on and off when they're cold, and when they're hot its even trickier. We've only used them a few times, but I suspect that after a few more times the lids will become useless. On the plus side, you can easily put two eggs in one coddler.

review/summary: Excellent Damson Preserves!
review/text: You wouldn't believe how many different brands I ordered in an attempt to find the recipe done properly.  We normally get a case of damson preserves every year from South Boston, VA, and they are so delicious; we share them with all of our friends.  This year, unfortunately, there was a shortage of damsons, so we couldn't acquire a single jar from South Boston.  I thought I couldn't possibly try another jar of inferior damson, and then a jar arrived from Tiptree, and I thought...okay, one more time...WOOHOO!!!  You have the pieces of damson fruit in there, exactly how we like!  This is what MAKES or breaks a recipe for damson preserves (not to mention the top quality ingredients of course).  So thank you.  I wish they weren't so expensive so we could order more.  I would dock you a star, but I can't bring myself to give you only 4 stars because the product is so outstanding.  Yum, yum, yum!  Thank you from California.

review/summary: Missing Only the Stones
review/text: Ever since damson plum preserves were not to be found on ordinary grocer's shelves due to the blight that afflicted damson plums in the U.S. i have searched for a product that most nearly resembled the taste and look of the damson plum preserves my grandmother used to make every September after purchasing a bushel of damson plums at Findlay Market in Cincinnati.  No luck, however, until, on a visit to Bermuda, I found the Tiptree product.  Tastes and looks exactly like hers, and Amazon.com brings it right to my door!  It's got everything except the occasional plum stone that escaped Grandma's watchful eye. I've tried many, many jars of supposedly damson plum jellies, jams, and preserves, but nothing comes close to Tiptree.

review/text: I grew up in MA. as well, and this is what we made coffee milkshakes with- ones that taste just like Friendly's. Now that I'm in CA. I have to find other ways to get it. FYI, 6 bottles here for $24 works out to a better deal if you've got other people to share with, but if it's way too much for you, try the Vermont Country Store online. It's more expensive, but they sell it in 2 bottle batches for $11. This stuff is worth it!

I ordered it after learning it was used to make the official drink of Rhode Island, "Coffee Milk".<br />It is made of corn syrup, coffee, and caramel color, but it tastes so good. To make coffee milk, you simply stir 2 teaspoonfuls into a glass of milk. The syrup is also served over ice cream, and used to make coffee milkshakes. Also try Autocrat Syrup, a family owned business since 1895, the leading producer of coffee syrups and one of the largest coffee roasters in New England.

review/summary: Definitely not an alternative to Nescafe Iced Java
review/text: When Nescafe discontinued their Iced Java coffee syrup, I went in search of an alternative. I bought a case of Coffee Time by Autocrat, because they said it was a "sweet coffee flavor." That sounds good, cause I like lots of sugar in my coffee. Well, Coffee Time was very disappointing. Barely any coffee flavor, and basically colored high fructose corn syrup. I bought a case of Eclipse, which their site said was a "more intense coffee flavor," but I defy anyone to tell the difference between the two products. (They're made at the same site, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same product in both containers.) Now I'm stuck with 12 bottles of a product that doesn't taste very good. I have to add chocolate syrup just to add some taste to it. Pretty disappointed, but oh well.

With her allergies to poultry it has been extremely difficult to find.  After you get dozens of "nose-up walk away" brands, you will pay just about anything they will eat.  Even though it is pricey, I will continue to buy it as long as she will eat it.  I am aware that it doesn't have the vitamins/minerals added, but I figure it is more nutritional than tuna every day.  The other foods in her rotation are the Natural value tuna with toppings and Tiki cat.

review/text: We have tried many many different brands of coconut water and when we purchased this one at the store we thought it had the best taste on the market and quickly ordered a case. The box arrived in great condition but, as many reviewers have noted, every single can was dented and scratched. On top of that, it didn't taste nearly as good as the ones we had purchased at the grocery store. I don't know if the dents would have altered the taste but there was definitely a difference. While still drinkable, we probably won't order again.

review/text: I recently received my second subscription delivery.  First of all, all the cans were horribly dented, as many reviewers have commented.  The cans from my first delivery were all okay.  This tells me the product handling is irratic.  Still, it would not have bothered me, until I opened one.  To my surprise, the taste was different than the first batch I received.  The product is 3 months old based on the date on the can, but it tasted like it was off.<br /><br />I really liked the idea that Blue Monkey is not from concentrate and slightly cheaper than Zico, but with such quality control problems, I have gone back to drinking Zico.

review/summary: 1st shipment, great, 2nd shipment-sucked :(
review/text: I tasted this brand of coconut water while vacationing in Hawai'i & loved it! I was so excited to find it on amazon. Despite negative reviews for dented cans, I ordered a 24-pack for $26.56 which I felt was a steal & signed up for subscribe & save. The 2nd shipment I received 2 months later (per my selected frequency. I didn't even check before I got my shipment, but apparently, the price jumped to $34.71!!! So, fine, my fault for not verifying before the shipment went out, I really liked this coconut water so I'll just eat it & look at the pricetag next time around. I got my 2nd shipment - cans were dented (a lot more of them w/ a lot deeper dents - this couldn't have happened in shipping since just about all the cans were dented - even the ones on the inside??? But who cares, dented cans, whatever...the worst thing - THE TASTE WAS AWFUL!!! I have to pour the coconut water out of the cans into a new container & let it sit (covered) in the fridge for a few days so the weird metallic/fermented taste dissipates...so weird...I was willing to drink it a little rancid - thought maybe it was 1 can, no, 2 cans, OK, maybe I should let someone else try a 3rd can...I then figured it helps to let it sit a few hrs in a different container. Needless to say, I canceled my subscribe & save subscriptions - sucks that I paid almost $10 more for a crappy shipment - boooooo...

review/summary: Blue Monkey is yummy and a good value
review/text: I spent a month trying every coconut water I could get my grubby little hands on. During my trials, I went to Whole Foods (booooo!) and took home at least six different brands.  I got another five from Sprouts (yay Sprouts!), and found at least another seven varieties at Central Market (yeehaw Central Market!!).  Of all the ones I tried, the one I liked the most that I could order in bulk was Blue Monkey.  I would definitely rank it among my top 3.  However, the other factor that made it a top pick for me was the 12 oz serving size and the attractive price point.  My orders were always fulfilled on time, and I had a consistent flow of good tasting coconut water.  I was actually planning on increasing my order to two cases per month.<br /><br />Today however, I'm sad because my automatic monthly order for a case of Blue Monkey through Amazon has been cancelled with no explanation.  My only recourse seems to be to let them notify me when it becomes available.  I don't know what happened, but I'm very disappointed.  I hope something changes soon.  Until then, I guess I'll buy O.N.E. or Amy and Brian's at Sprouts or Central Market.  If it becomes available again I'll switch my four stars to five.

review/summary: Beat-up appearance, upbeat tatse
review/text: Just received my first order of Blue Monkey coconut water yesterday and my first impression after opening the packaging was "what the heck happened to all these cans?" as virtually 21 of 24 can were substantially dented and scratched. Looks like someone was playing catch with them while wearing a concrete mitt as the cans somehow got beat-up something good. Fortunately there does not look to be any punctures or spoilage of the actual coconut water itself. Am sipping my first one as I write this and the taste is a but stronger and not as sweet as other coco water brands I have tried, but overall a decent taste. The manufacturer/distributor must offer the swell pricing on a case because they are pretty much only shipping the cans with external damage.

Blue Monkey is a product of Thailand (like A&B's and C2O), therefore the coconut water is naturally sweeter and more flavourful than the Brazilian-origin coconut water brands such as Zico and VitaCoco (which I find to lack flavour).<br /><br />The current price of Blue Monkey on Amazon beats the price of A&B's and C2O so no reason not to buy!

review/summary: Great taste, great value. Try it!
review/text: I've just begun drinking coconut water, and this is my favorite so far both in value and in taste. It is the sweetest I've found that doesn't contain any added sugar (like some brands of "coconut juice"). If you've tried Zico and have been disgusted by its lack of flavor, give this one a try. It's cheaper, and muuuuuch tastier. And it's good for you! Only 76 calories in a can: much healthier than a can of soda.<br /><br />As to the packaging, mine arrived with perhaps 5 cans slightly dented and all others perfectly intact. I can't complain about that, considering that it's an imported product. And mine arrived nicely chilled, so I could enjoy a can right away! That may be the product of the colder weather, but it was a nice surprise.<br /><br />The one thing to note is that this brand comes without coconut pulp. I rather enjoy having bits of coconut to chew on, but it isn't a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />I used the subscribe-and-save option just to get the better price the first time around, but this product won me over. I plan on keeping my subscription.

review/text: this and Amy&Brian's coconut juice are my favorite. I've also tried vita coco, O.n.e. and generic brands. Blue monkey is also the cheapest i've found on amazon at $0.10 an ounce using subscribe and save. i find this to be a better serving size than 17 ounce Amy&Brian cans at 11.2 ounces for Blue monkey. Definitely recommend.

review/summary: best tasting coconut water, and the dents aren't that big a deal.
review/text: Please do not take to heart that the cans may dented upon arrival. Keep in mind that this coconut water is coming all the way from Thailand, and dents could occur from all the handling from place to place. The coconut water inside the cans is unharmed, and well worth the price paid on amazon.com. Plus, the cans can be recycled, to where many other well known mass-produced and advertised brands cannot. This is the best tasting coconut water hands down, and I've tried ALL of them, seriously. Give blue monkey coconut water a try if you could care less about dented cans, care about recycling your packaging, and are looking for the best tasting coconut water.

review/summary: Best-tasting Coconut Water but Crappy Packaging
review/text: This brand tastes AWESOME!  It is by far the most natural and best-tasting of all the packaged waters on the market.  I give the product itself five stars.<br /><br />As other reviewing noted, however, the vast majority of the cans arrive dented. Amazon packs the Blue Monkey box within one of its boxes so I suspect the issue is with Blue Monkey, not Amazon.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fabulous-tasting and refreshing dink, Blue Money Coconut Water is it!  Hopefully the packaging issue will get sorted out.

review/summary: One Ingredient
review/text: I knew nothing about this brand, but I bought a case because it has a good price. I was very pleased to find that it has just one ingredient: coconut water. There is no added sugar or preservatives. It's unfortunate when you buy a coconut water can for the health benefits, only to see that it has tons of sugar and other unwanted additives. This product does not have pulp, which is one thing I prefer. Other than that, this is the best canned coconut water I've had, and it's well priced. Highly recommended!!!

review/summary: My favorite coconut water, and no dents!
review/text: I'd rather not write this review, because I want to keep this product a secret, but I just have to give praise to the Blue Monkey :) I guess I discovered Blue Monkey coconut water at the right time, because the price is right and when I received my order, it was packaged by Amazon as a box-within-a-box. Not a single can was dented as some other reviewers described. The cans are a heavy duty aluminum like I've found when I had a soda in Europe or S. America. Speaking of the product specifically, the portion is perfect and the taste is by far my favorite. No added Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), which I find gives other coconut waters a somewhat sharper taste (for lack of a better discriptor). The 11.2 oz. can is great, too. I would rarely drink an entire 17 oz. can , so here I don't feel like I'm wasting any or letting it sit open until I come back for the second serving. The flavor is most similar to C2O or Amy & Brian's, and less like VitaCoco or Zico. I've had most every brand, and even though taste is pretty subjective, I would rate this as 5 stars for the overall experience and price. I got it on the subscription program for once-per-month delivery, and the price savings are a great deal.

review/text: We have tried all of the brands of coconut water available in our area (Dallas, Texas) and this is the best tasting. The only thing I can say that is negative is the packaging from Amazon and the manufacturer. All of the cans are dented, but this doesn't impact the product. Just realize when you order the case from Amazon, the cans will be dented. Otherwise, this product is wonderful! The best tasting product!

review/text: I had  pure coconut water product in canada ,which I liked and therefore ordered this product over here. They send me pure coconut water with pulp instead. I do not like the pulp in the pure coconut water. The canister I recieved had a bold yellow label stating " with Pulp" . And the can showed in the picture on this website does not show " with pulp" . It was misleading. If you like the pulp go for it its great product. Just that pulp in the water gives some strong coconut smell which I donot like.

review/text: I bought a can of this at my local Whole Foods / Harry's and I was disappointed. I felt like the only thing I could taste was the can it was in. This does not taste like fresh coconut water. It tastes like a tin can with some musty coconut flavor. I'm not very picky but I didn't even finish it. I wonder if this issue is why many other brands use the paper box style containers.

review/text: I was disappointed in the condition of the cans as they arrived almost all with big dents, sometimes more than two on a can. I have heard that it isn't safe to drink from cans that have dents, so I had to research the risk and check out each can for the location of the dents. I contemplated sending them back, but have decided it is most likely safe to drink. Still, this isn't what I had in mind: to drink a beverage that is supposedly good for one's health while being concerned about the remote possibility of botulism! In the future, please package this product properly so it arrives in flawness condition.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: This is excellent short grain brown rice.  As good as any I have seen.  Many rice users do not know the difference between short and long grain rice.  Locally it is impossible to locate the short grain variety, especially brown.  Most oriental dishes uses the short grain variety which is starchier and generally stickier than the long grain. Long grain is harder and the grains are not plump like short grain. The rice from Angelinas is very nice, clean and uniform.  Delivery was extremely fast.  In fact it arrived about the same time as the Email saying it had been shipped.  Shipping charges were kinda dear considering the nearness of the source.  But very pleased with the service and quality of the product. Expect to go for the 25 pound sack next time.

The fact that this tea is organic, naturally caffeine free, and full of antioxidants is just a bonus.

review/summary: Lovely mint tea!
review/text: I ended up choosing this from the numerous mint tea options available on amazon because I'd tried Revolution's Earl Grey before and loved it. This stuff is just fantastic! First of all, it comes in a tetrahedral teabag, as opposed to a flat one. The bag is made out of a sort of nylon-type mesh instead of paper, so you don't get any weird paper taste (it matters more in the more delicate herbal teas than the darker black teas, for me anyway). Secondly, inside the tea bag, you get actual mint leaves, not tiny flakes and dust. And because the tea bag has a more 3-dimensional shape, the leaves don't get crushed as much either. The flavor is absolutely delightful! It's very smooth and aromatic, no bitterness or anything unpleasant at all. Great night time tea or anytime relaxing tea! If you don't like your tea very strong, you can use one tea bag to infuse two cups. Also, if you're not that into hot tea, this tastes pretty good cold as well, especially if you add a little sugar. Very reasonably priced high quality tea and probably about the best you can do without going loose leaf. Will definitely keep buying this!

review/summary: Good, but not quite my taste
review/text: To be fair, this was my first attempt at home brewing.  With that in mind:<br /><br />I thought this was a well thought out kit, and the instructions were easy to follow.  Even though I did make a few mistakes in the process, the beer turned out better than I expected.  For a starter kit, I give it high marks.  There are a couple of things that, had I known, I would have accounted for and possibly had a better result:<br /><br />1)  The hops are in pellet form, and they fall apart when they hit the wort.  I strongly recommend that you use a natural cloth steeping bag to make clean up easier.  If not, expect to be picking flakes of hops out of your buckets, brushes, strainers, and teeth for a couple of weeks.<br /><br />2)  The instructions say to take the label off the can of malt extract.  What they forget to mention is that the label is pasted on with an industrial strength adhesive, from end to end, top to bottom.  Getting the label off requires a fair amount of patience and a lot of hot water.  It would be much better if the manufacturer would simply glue the label to itself so you can rip it right off without having to scald yourself on a hot can.<br /><br />Overall, the beer, while a touch stout for my taste, has been tasty.  The kit was well put together, especially from a beginning brewer's perspective.  I will likely purchase a red ale kit from the same maker for my next batch.

review/summary: Fabulous food!
review/text: I just had to let you know what a miracle this food has been for me and my dogs!  I have four Chihuahuas of my own and a fifth as a foster, and I spent a long time researching foods to make a switch after P&G took over Natura (we were on Innova).  My female can be picky and does horribly with food pieces that are too big, so I was thrilled when I saw the thin triangles in the bag.  She happily crunches right through them, which is great, since she and one of my boys have horrible teeth and having to chew the food helps.  My only guess why the other reviewer had an issue with the food was switching over too fast.  I switched slowly over a few weeks as I always do (the vet at the zoo I used to work with recommends no less than a 2 week transition).  Especially if you are switching from a lower quality food, the richness of this food would throw digestion off if you switch cold turkey.<br /><br />My alpha male has been on Hills C/D almost all his life because he was diagnosed with struvite crystals as a young dog (he is almost 11 now).  He was the only one of my pack who looked old.  Dull coat, dandruff, and a gaunt look to his face and body.  I knew it had to be the food, so looked at all the levels and decided on the Whitefish formula as a food trial, hoping he wouldn't develop crystals again on a hollistic food.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  He looks fantastic, he and the female (same age) are more active, and I'm happy to report that after 2.5 months, his urinalysis was clean!<br /><br />Our third dog and our foster dog both have very course hair, and since starting this food, they have both become much softer.  Everyone is shiny and (before the weather got so dry) dandruff-free!  Best of all, each and every one of the dogs is absolutely CRAZY about the taste of the food, and even my girl who we used to have to push to finish her dinner now eats with everyone else in under two minutes and then licks the crumbs up off her eating blanket.  It's truly miraculous.  I couldn't be any happier with this food.  It may cost more than the lower quality foods, but if you added all the supplements it would take to get this level of nutrition, you'd be spending more anyway.  Love it, love it, LOVE IT!

review/text: I LOVE Fromm pet foods and agree with an earlier review about my dog's coarse hair becoming soft and smooth after eating Fromm, but this particular variety is his worst enemy.  He puts his tail between his legs and delays eating it until late in the afternoon when he just can't stand the hunger pangs anymore.  Unfortunately, I had purchased a 30 lb. bag and he is a small dog.  We made it (barely) through a third of a bag before I sold the remains on the cheap to a friend.  Her dogs didn't care for it either, but her somewhat overweight dog ate it anyway (because she eats anything).<br /><br />Our local supplier of Fromm said that this variety is the least popular.<br /><br />Ironically, one of my CATS loves it!  Must be the fish in it!<br /><br />Anyway, I haven't given up on Fromm foods for my dog, but I will never buy this variety again.

review/summary: Not For My Dogs
review/text: Two dogs threw up the first night I fed. None of them liked it. I had to doctor up just to get them to eat it. One of my girls got the shakes and tremors like she'd been poisoned. Scared me to death! Thank goodness I only got one bad to try.

review/summary: Best one of all
review/text: I have tried every one of Cafe Britt's coffees and, although all are very good, I like this one the best. To me it has a rich, nutty flavor that I can drink all day. Cafe Britt uses an all-purpose grind which works well as drip or as expresso. I brew it as expresso and find that the flavor remains smooth and is never bitter whether I'm drinking it hot in winter or iced in summer. In the summer, I make a carafe and put it in the fridge to chill. Then, when I want iced coffee, I just put milk, ice and my cold expresso in a large glass for "instant" iced "cafe con leche". Very refreshing on a hot summer morning!

review/summary: The Best Coffee in The World
review/text: The Britt Poas blend is a bit spicier and nuttier than the regular dark roast but it is still relatively low acid and is very drinkable, very pleasurable. I first tried it on my honeymoon in Costa Rica in 2004 and I have drunk almost nothing else since. Much more robust and flavorful than Dunkin Donuts blend. I stopped going to DD and now brew a pot of Poas before I leave the house every morning, filling my thermos to the brim; this saves me huge $$ over the year AND I eat fewer donuts which is good :-). If you are a coffee lover I promise you will love this coffee as much my wife and I do. I have found nothing better.

review/summary: A definite must try for a coffee lover
review/text: I have visited the beautiful Poas coffee plant that Cafe Brit has.  Poas Volcanic area is one of the better places from which to get coffee in Costa Rica. The altitude and more northern, inland location is slightly different from other growing areas in Costa Rica and oddly that has some impact on the quality (temperature and rain).<br /><br />Costa Rican coffees tend to be among my favorite because the flavor is mild and yet rich at the same time.  The roasts do not have that burnt feeling that comes from french roasting.  Despite that the coffee is grown in a volcanic region, the coffees tend to be less acidic then the Kenyan or Javan counterparts.  There is something just more, rich or coffee-ish, that separates them from other coffees as well (Panamanian, Columbian, etc).  I think the only other coffee I tend to like slightly better is Jamaican, but a good Jamaican coffee is significantly more expensive.<br /><br />If you take cream drinker, this blends splendidly to the point where you feel almost no acidity. I would definitely get this coffee if you can't find it locally in a store.  I almost always grab a few bags on my trips back from Costa Rica.

review/summary: Shipping charge
review/text: Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Britt coffees and Costa Rican coffees.  I don't have an issue with the product or the price for the product.  My beef is with the outrageous shipping charge for a 12 oz. sealed bag of coffee.  That was about $10.  The coffee cost $9.50.  The shipping box was big enough to hold ten bags of coffee.  Why not just a sturdy envelope?  I will definitely find Costa Rican coffee in my local area and buy from a brick & stick store.  Usually I try to offset the state sales tax (8.25% in  the DFW area)with the shipping and handling charge.  There seems to be a trend of increasing shipping and handling costs.  Local sales tax on this purchase would have been in the range of $0.80.  Soon we will all be paying sales tax AND shipping charges through on internet sales unless something keeps us from paying ANOTHER tax which will surely affect the internet market.  Anyway, just my 2 cents worth.  No more Britt through Amazon for me.

review/text: I bought this and the White Chocolate syrup and was very satisfied.  When I added the syrup I needed to cut out the sugar (I usually only added 1 spoon of sugar to begin with) because it is very sweet, but the taste is amazing.

review/summary: Vivid color, great taste!
review/text: Perfect addition to my wedding reception candy buffet!  They were so vivid in color, which was perfect for my all purple candy buffet.<br /><br />Everyone was commenting on the great flavor, too.  Never seen purple gummi bears, but these are something I'd recommend to others now that I've seen and tried them.

review/summary: Delicious Grape Gummis
review/text: Used these as part of my wedding favors. Purple was one of the main colors and everyone loves gummi bears. The only problem....everywhere we looked it was the one color that was not available. How can you have a "Rainbow" of gummi bears without the purple. We decided to order these and were very impressed. They came in a nicely padded envelope with a freeze pack to keep them cool. They arrived still cold and in perfect shape. The color is exactly like the photo and they have a very grape flavor. Quite a few people were surprised to see grape gummi bears and thought they didn't exist. It was an excellent addition to the favors. We will be order these delicious gummis again.

review/summary: Can't beat it for the price
review/text: This is the best and best-tasting organic cocoa powder available for the price. That said, it can be found at a better price than Amazon is currently asking. This is NOT hot chocolate. It is pure organic cocoa powder without added sweetener of any kind which means you can add your own sweetener of choice in the amount you like. This cocoa powder is also great for baking.<br /><br />It mixes easily with water and other liquids if you go about it in the right way: place the desired amount of cocoa powder in a glass or cup, then add a small amount of liquid, hot or cold, stir well till smooth, then add the rest of the liquid and stir again. I use protein drinks daily and prefer chocolate to vanilla but no longer purchase the chocolate flavored protein powders. I get better results by using vanilla protein powder, adding 1 or 2 tsp of NOW Cocoa Powder to the protein powder and then adding liquid and mixing as described above. I trust this brand over whatever generic cocoa powder the chocolate protein powders contain. The protein drink can be improved even more by adding a teaspoon or so of Udo's Choice Wholesome Fast Food <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010EBERI">Udo's Choice Wholesome Fast Food 16-Ounces</a> before mixing with liquid. That product has almost no taste of its own but is a great way of adding much needed fiber to one's diet and as a bonus makes mixing of the protein powder with liquid much easier - - - no blender required, just mix as above, wait about 5 minutes then drink and enjoy.<br /><br />Update 05/20/2011:<br /><br />Since I wrote this review Amazon.com has increased its price on this item even more, to the point that it is outrageous. Almost all my purchases are made on Amazon.com, but I refuse to pay almost $9 for 12 oz of this excellent brand of organic cocoa powder when it is available elsewhere for $5.50 or less if you take the time and trouble to search for it. And to Amazon.com I inquire, "Why, why why are you doing this?"
