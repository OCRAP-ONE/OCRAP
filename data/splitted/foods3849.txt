review/summary: Wow.... lots of saturated fat
review/text: There are 80 calories per cup of this coffee, 40 of those are from fat. The description says it is mildly sweet but I found it overwhelmingly sweet. There was little to no coffee taste, more like Cremora or Coffee Mate with fake sugar. I tried brewing one k cup of this coffee and then in the same cup added another k cup which was regular coffee in hopes of diluting the sweetness but even that way, it was still very sweet and whatever creamer they used was the dominant flavor by far.<br /><br />If you take a lot of cream and sugar in your coffee, you might like this coffee. I didn't like it at all.

review/summary: Gas Station Cappuccino
review/text: If you are a coffee snob, you will not like this cappuccino.  However, for those of us easing into the world of coffee, this is a nice and sweet caffeinated beverage with only 80 calories.  It tastes just like the cappuccinos you get out of the machine at a gas station.  A nice treat!

review/text: Another review said this tastes like the "garbage" cappuccinos from the gas station. Well in my case, that is exactly what I wanted! These K-Cups are delicious. Creamy and taste just like the french vanilla capps from QuikTrip. I recommend them highly if that is the taste you are looking for.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Normally I don't care for coffee at all, but I absolutely loved these!<br /><br />My sister got one of the Keurig coffee machines, and there were samples of the French Vanilla ones included in the box. She told me that she thought I would like them, so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />She was right! I absolutely loved the,, and after running out of the samples decided to order some from Amazon. After ordering those, I saw these Caramel flavored ones and knew I had to try them!<br /><br />I was so excited when they arrived that I didn't waste any time and instantly brewed one up and tried it. I liked it even better than the French Vanilla ones!<br /><br />For me, they were the perfect ammount of sweetness, and I didn't find there to be any weird artificial sweetner taste as some other reviwers have mentioned.<br /><br />Now I drink one of these every day. There is nothing I prefer more in the morning than one of these.<br /><br />Maybe these aren't for the hardcore coffee connoisseur, but for someone like me, they are awesome!<br /><br />I would highly recommend these to everyone. Especially people who normally don't like coffee. A+ and 5 stars in my book.

review/summary: Something we agree on!
review/text: My wife and I both enjoy this cappucccino!  If you enjoy a dark roast or coffee that is bitter and dark this is not for you. Its light and the taste is easy to drink.  My wife doesn't like a cup loaded with caffeine so this fit the bill for her.  I love that I can brew and go! No sugar or creamer needed unless you have a crazy sweet tooth.  I put a couple k cups to fit in a travel mug and I'm always sorry when its gone.  That means I will have to go back to the truely terrible coffee at work!

A very nice cappuccino for the price and the caramel flavoring is just right.

review/text: I enjoy all three of the Grove Square Cappuccino flavors as does my family. I have slowly stopped buying the regular coffee and have swapped over to this brand as I seem to have become addicted to the caramel as I can't get enough of its sweet flavor. At $7.98 a box at Walmart I can buy this and NOT have to buy those flavored creamers. I shake the cup prior to use and set the machine for 8 oz....YUM!

One caution is that it will clog up the opening on my Keurig.  (found that out the hard way)  Now I usually run through just a cup of hot water afterwards and that keeps it clean.

review/text: Initially I was a little bit skeptical about this product, but thought for the price that I should give it a try. I am happy that I did. It is a nice tasting cappuccino and is not too sweet. The taste is better with the smaller sized cups (6oz), it gets a bit watered down with the larger cup sizes. I will be buying this product again.

review/text: I was hoping for a nice creamy cappuccino for the evenings or during the day where a strong brew wasn't needed.  Well, *some* coffee flavor would have been good.  This tastes like coffeemate plus sugar plus old coffee grounds.  Its flat, sweet, thin, and ends with something of a slightly bitter aftertaste, reminiscent of aspartame...  with nothing in between.  There's not even a filter inside the k-cup...  just mostly cheap creamer...

review/text: I bought the Keurig for my husband who really did not want it.  I don't drink coffee but love, love gadgets.  So order to enjoy my new GADGET I had to find something to make.  I found Grove Square Cappuccino by accident.  I add some whipped cream on the top and what I end up with is a heavenly dessert that has none of the bitter taste of coffee.  I also bought the French Vanilla version and decided I liked it so much that I am on a monthly plan.  For anyone who loves flavored drinks this is perfect.  And my hubby finally came around and uses the Keurig for his coffee.  He does not use this drink since it does not have a coffee taste, thank goodness.<br /><br />I have been watching negatives and positives.  It is all a matter of preference and taste.  I happen to love this coffee because it is sweet and does not taste like coffee.  I simply hate coffee and this is a way to enjoy the Keurig and share some time with my husband who does drink coffee.  As for the additives... welcome to this world of the 21st century!  It satifies my sweet tooth and keeps me from eating cake, cookies, pie and ice cream.  So Grove Square bring it on.

review/summary: Price Vs. Flavor
review/text: I'm on the fence with Grove Square's Cappuccino Cups - French Vanilla.<br /><br />On one hand, for the price at least, they're great. Sadly on the other hand, they're way too sweet for an every morning drink. The first time I tried it, I had already added cream and sugar before I ever took a sip. That was a bad idea.<br /><br />I'd buy it again in a lesser Qty, but 54 of these is going to last me a long time. They aren't bad at all, I just wasn't expecting such a sweet drink.

review/text: I did not like this at all, worse than the gas station cappiccino, which I do like. The grove square french vanilla is just nasty really and it leaves a bad after taste. oh and you have to run a hot water cycle after using it to clean the machine, nothing lefted in the k-cup either, well just a little bit of water to leak from the k-cup when throwing away. I will not buy this again at any price.<br />The only reason for the one star rating was because the shipping and packaging of the products was nicely done, free super saving shipping is great. I just wish the contents of said packaging had been on par. anyone know of a good cappuccino for the keurig?

It tasted watered down even at the suggested cup setting. We honestly could have got a container of this same stuff at the local dollar store for a lot cheaper and then we could have added more of the powder when needed. Definitely not worth the money.

review/text: Any product with hydrogenated vegetable oils as the first ingredient isn't worth buying.  This stuff has been banned in NY for a reason - it is poison for the human body. See the Wikipedia article on trans fats for more information.  Here is a clip : "Because of these facts and concerns, the NAS has concluded there is no safe level of trans fat consumption. There is no adequate level, recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats. This is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary heart disease.[2] "

I've tasted better, but seeing as it's not made by a barista and only takes 5 seconds to produce, I'd say it's not bad. I was able to drink the whole cup, and that's good enough for me. However, if the fake sugar makes you sick, I'd stay away from this. Let's just say it's not organic or homemade, which it's not claiming to be.

review/text: These cappucino k-cups are truly awful. I pre-ordered this one as well as the french vanilla one and they are both horrible. The consistency, taste, and smell are exactly like the cappucino you get out of those machines at the gas station. Don't bother, there are way better k-cups out there...the green mountain espresso one and the gloria jean cappucino ones are much better. Yes you have to mix your own milk in, but you can get creative and get a cheap foamer to use with different flavored creamers. Way better.

If you prefer the strong, exotic, even authentic taste, this is not the coffee for you. But if you are looking for coffee that is sweet, and tasty without having to do much, this is it.

review/summary: WAKE UP PEOPLE  You are being scammed !
review/text: This company is scamming everyone.  They put instant coffee in a k-cup and pass it off as real brewed coffee.  I purchased their Dark roast to try it out.<br />The first thing I noticed was how lite the k-cup felt.  If you shake it, it sounds like a little snarl drum.  As it brews, you get a real dark thick mixture of water and coffee, and then only water.  When it was done I opened the k-cup.  No coffee grounds, No filter, Nothing inside, completely empty.  The coffee is only for 8 oz. cups, any larger and it is watered down coffee.  Even at 8 oz., the coffee didn't taste good. (that's my personal opinion on the taste)  Overall:  You're getting low quality instant coffee at fresh brewed prices.  Shame on Grove Square.

The taste is worse than Pakastani gas station brew, it's more like Nescafe that's been left to burn in a pot for hours. If you think this review is an exaggeration and you have money to waste, try it out, and then proceed to throw $10 in the trash can. Keurig should seriously consider removing all of Grove square's products.

review/text: If you're looking to buy some French Vanilla coffee, look no further! Having tried several k-cup flavors, I have to say this French Vanilla is in a league of it's own. It is amazing, so rich and creamy. I have made it both on the medium and small settings on my Keurig and both are very good, the small so creamy and thick, almost like a dessert. AND it is the least expensive of all the cups I've tried, being only 50c per cup, with the next lowest being 67c. I can't wait to try the Grove Square caramel flavor.

review/summary: Requires special cleaning
review/text: It wasn't until my It got "backed up" and only dispensed a half-cup that I realized these were instant and as such, required special cleaning. These are not the brew kind so after making a cup, you need to run 1-2 cups of water through the It or the needle and bottom of the filter dispenser/spout (I have no idea what it is called) gets clogged. I clean my It frequently, but these and the hot cocoas are really not worth the hassle of two cups of water after every cup I make. The cappuccino tins from like International Coffee or a packet of swiss miss, etc are much less fuss.

review/summary: PLEASE BE AWARE!!!! this is good but it contains Sucralose (splenda) and I am allergic
review/text: I would like to start of by saying this tastes wonderful, BUT and this is a big one I wish that on all the packaging it would state that the product contains Sucralose (Splenda) and I am allergic to it and Have just had a VERY SCARY allergic reaction to it, My throat started to close up and and I had to take a benadryl and waiting for it to start really working its magic (and hoping it does so I won't have to go to the er). Had I known that this product had Sucralose (splenda) in it I wouldn't have bought it. Grove Square PLEASE put it on your boxes, so that all of us that are allergic can stay away from it, Amazon Please post that this has Splenda in it so people know it.<br />I gave this 2 stars because it has a good taste aside form the after taste of the splenda, I wish I could have given it more stars<br /><br />Thank you for listening

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: I found this when I was shopping at Walmart and decided to give it a try.  I do have to say that it does smell good being "brewed".  I was very disappointed to find out that it tastes like the crap that you get at a convenient store.  Once you have Real Cappuccino you really can't ever drink that CRAPuccino at convenient stores.  I know I won't ever buy any of their "cappuccino" again, but I will give their hot chocolate and apple cider a try in hopes that they are drinkable.

review/summary: Good for K-Cup Instant Gratification
review/text: Why do some reviewers seem to expect Italian coffee house products in each and every product made for K-Cups?  This is a Very Nice Cappuccino / French Vanilla flavored drink.  It is well above what you find in some gas stations - and not as good as in some others.  Just because you get it in a gas station does not make it bad - go to Italy and find out.  This makes a very acceptable cup using the middle or lowest setting.  Remember - less is stronger.<br /><br />60 cal (40 fat)  --  4.5g fat sat  --  9 carb  --  5g sugar  --  0g fiber

review/summary: First ingredient is trans fat ( partially hydrogenated oil )
review/text: The ingredient tab on the product page doesn't show what is in this cappuccino.  The very first ingredient when I got my order and reviewed it was trans fat, and not just a little.  This stuff will clog your arteries.  I wouldn't have purchased this had the product info been shown.  I didn't know they still used this stuff.  New York outlawed the stuff and the FDA explicitly makes manufactures show this ingredient.  Shame on Amazon for not displaying this.  I did order addition K-cup coffee. I"ll return them.

review/summary: Refreshing for the Afternoon Blahs
review/text: Yes, this is an instant coffee.  It dissolves as the hot water runs through the K-Cup.  But it is so refreshing and fast when you need a pick-me-up cup of coffee.  The flavor is wonderful.  My husband and I also like the hazelnut and caramel flavors.  You can't beat this price, especially with "Subscribe and Save".  I have found Grove Square at HEB in Texas, but it is more expensive than the price here.  I'm not very picky about it being a perfectly brewed coffee with deep, rich taste.  I just want something that is hot and tasty.  Try it out and if you don't like it, share it with a friend or family member who will be glad to have some free, good coffee.  A box of 18 K-Cups makes a great hostess gift.  By the way, the order is for 3 boxes of 18, a total of 54 cups of coffee.  I wasn't too clear on that when I ordered the first time.  Why pay $3 for a cup at Starbucks when this is just as good, convenient at home, and tastes great?

review/summary: Not good, couldn't finish my cup
review/text: I purchased these at walmart but they were so bad I wanted to come review them so you guys online can be warned.  I brewed myself a cup and it was so bad I couldn't even drink it, i had to throw it out.  First off, I want to say that I'm not a cappuccino snob, I enjoy a great cappuccino at a coffee shop but I also regularly drink the powdered flavored kind that you just mix with water.  I didn't have the highest of standards for this drink to begun with but it was bad, t doesn't have very much flavor the flavor that it does have is not good, it's watery (I brewed it on the small cup setting) and it has a bad aftertaste that I just couldn't get over.  These are also pretty expensive for what you get and you are much better off in my opinion to just go to get a mix with water types.

review/summary: There's a reason why these are so cheap
review/text: Indeed, this nonsense product parading around like it's real cappuccino is right up there with that swill you get out of the gas station machine.  High in calories, low in quality, you get what you pay for.  I had to take and mix one of these with a cup of regular coffee to make it drinkable.  Granted, I've only had 2 cups of it but I'm going to give the rest of the box away.  Save yourself the disappointment and the money and avoid this garbage.

review/summary: Not Typical Coffee K-Cup
review/text: This is not a typical K-Cup, this is a powder. If you are hunting for a new coffee, this is not it. Imagine those cheap bags of hot chocolate in a more expensive K-Cup, and that's essentially what this is. Got it for $9 and I still feel disappointed. Doesn't taste bad, but nothing impressive. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.

review/text: One of my coworkers bought a giant K-Cup variety pack, and this variety was in there. Man, it's delicious. It's as good as those French Vanilla cappuccinos you might get from a gas station in the middle of the night when driving down I-5, but you can get it in your own kitchen.<br /><br />Does it have much coffee in there? It's hard to say. The box claims that there is some instant coffee inside, but it certainly doesn't taste like it. It simply tastes like sweet delicious vanilla.
