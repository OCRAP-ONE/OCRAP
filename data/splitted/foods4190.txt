review/summary: Even Better
review/text: This is our second order, we first got the 35 cups, and it was just in a box. This order came in a nice flip open top box, with all of them in order. Good selection, some decaf but oh well. I plan to order again from them. We love getting a wide variety.

review/summary: Not a Gift Pack
review/text: I did indeed get 91 assorted coffees and what might be a limited edition print but the packaging was atrocious.  The box was a plain cardboard box & it looked like they had just dumped all the coffee from damaged boxes into a bin and had counted out 91 k-cups into the first box they had found handy. (At least the selection seemed extensive.)  The tube with the print was so stiff that I couldn't get the print out. Since this was the last one in this shipment I sincerely hope that there was a shipping accident at the vendor's and they chose to send something rather than cancel an order and the one that I ordered as a gift went out in a proper box.

review/summary: Description is Misleading
review/text: I was disappointed, as it was my belief that this was a "coffee only" sampler. If I had wanted 3 different kinds of cider, I would have ordered them. I also did not expect to be sent decaf. That is something that someone generally orders specifically. I think I'll stick to ordering specific K cups in the future.

If you guys would make a version with NO decaf, I would be a regular buyer.  My last order was over 1/2 decaf :(.<br />I'm sure a caffine filled box would make a lot more folks happy!

review/text: The boxes are really nice to see all the different kinds of coffee.  Most of the coffees I really liked and I made note of the ones I didn't.  I just wouldn't order again because there were 13 or 14 decaf and I don't really have a need for those.  I guess it's fine to have a few here for guests but would stop me from purchasing this box again.

review/summary: Decent deal
review/text: Shipping was relatively quick...5 days. The estimated shipping quoted was 3-4 weeks. It would have to travel around the world 3 times to take that long. Out of the 70 cups, 12 were Decaf. There were 3-4 duplicates. I have previously ordered this product and it arrived in 2 neatly comparted boxes so you could clearly see your selections. This time it came all thrown into one box loose and I had to sort them so I could arrange them in some kind of order. The selection is probably 60/40 (regular/flavored) with no teas or items other than coffee. I would buy again.

review/summary: 70 count K-cup assortment was wonderful!
review/text: I received my 70 count assortment in two seperate 35 count gift boxes.  Very pretty hinged, printed boxes with individual holes for each little cup made a great presentation.  No two k-cups were the same, and there was a variety of both caffeinated and decaf varieties, which was perfect for us since I prefer decaf and my husband prefers his caffeine.  We also got a few cappucinos, which I haven't tried yet.  Nice assortemt of flavored, dark roast, and regular roast coffees.  I already placed a second order!  This was a fantastic way to try different kinds of coffee, especially for those new to the K-cup world.

review/summary: A little bit of heaven for the K-cup owner
review/text: Okay. Let's all get this out right now. If you use a K-cup machine at work, or have one at home, eventually you will want to try EVERY flavor. This gives you a whopping 70 cups, albeit many are the decaf version of one in the box, too. But still...sooooo many to chose from.....<br /><br />For the sheer, odd thrill of uber selection, this rocks! When I bought it for myself, my fellow K- cuppers at work begged me to bring it in, just so they could drool over the selection...but I knew I would never get it home without a couple of the cups missing!<br /><br />No, per cup it is not a bargain. But the only way to get this many different flavors at once would be to have a K-cup exchange like a Christmas cookie exchange sort of thing. Much easier to order this.

review/summary: Decaf surprise! -1 star
review/text: Product was packaged very well. 2 separate flats with the k-cups nestled firmly into their own spots. Our previous bulk k-cups were just dumped into an amazon box. They even took the time to align the print on the k-cups so it was all facing the same way in the flats.<br />Was a bit unpleasantly surprised by the inclusion of 8 Decaf cups in the first flat (luckily only 2 in the second) Wish they would have mentioned that in the description because that makes 10 of these k-cups totally useless to me and my wife, and cuts down on the value of buying in bulk. The incredible variety of the pack though nulls out the useless decaf in my opinion. We have been drinking the exact same k-cups for the last year so the variety is welcome.

review/summary: WARNING! Contains decaf, Otherwise great!
review/text: First things first, heads up everyone, this pack contains decaf! I'm not a decaf person and neither is anyone in my house. So, while I'm sure we will use the decafs, I wish I knew they were in there before I purchased this pack. Looking in the picture provided by the seller, you can see decaf written on some of the cups, but it is pretty hard to see and this is something I'd expect to see in the description.<br /><br />That said, I'm incredibly impressed on all other points. The price is great, the assortment is great (although I did get one duplicate, oh well) and the flip-top box they come in is great! I have purchased other "custom assortment" k-cup selections on amazon before and gotten them in a brown lunch bag. And honestly, that's about what I expected. But, the flip top box was over the top. I figured I would share a picture of it on here. FYI, the numbers on the side in my picture were written by me, they did not come the way from the seller. Seems that the seller really did get the hint from the other reviews.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind a few decafs thrown in!

review/summary: Incredible assortment of flavors
review/text: When I got this I was a little disappointing in the packaging, and was thinking this is at best a 4 star item, then I started rummaging through all the different flavors you get. Half the fun of the Keurig is all the flavors you get to try, when you're buying online and it's all 24 count boxes it gets pricey to keep trying them and we have a few boxes that we hate and have no idea what to do with. This sampler pack is just perfect, it allows me to try them all without spending a fortune.<br />My wife and I have a lot of fun trying new flavors every day, compare notes pretending we're coffee snobs. We jot down the flavors we love for the future and now we're set going forward.<br /><br />In a nutshell, yes the packaging sucks, but being able to try out 90 flavors more than makes up for it...

review/summary: Good, but Decaf is not a flavor.
review/text: Overall, this is a good selection of coffees for the Keurig brewer crowd and a good value.  I've enjoyed quite a few new selections that I have not had the opportunity to sample previously.<br /><br />I have just one complaint, which kept this item from getting a 5-star review:  Decaf is not a flavor.  Drinking decaffeinated coffee is a choice.  In general, I would say that those who drink regular, caffeinated coffee do not want decaf.  Likewise, those who drink decaf often do so for health reasons and certainly do not want caffeinated coffees.  This selection of 70 cups included about 12 decaf "flavors".  I put them aside for offering to the occasional friend who may be over for dinner or what not, but will probably end up drinking them myself as a last resort.  This is, however, not a choice I would have made and not at all what I would expect from a sampler selection.<br /><br />These sample collections should be offered in separate caf and decaf versions.  In that way, decaf drinkers can get a good sampler (something I rarely see available for them), and the rest of us get a selection of coffees that we actually want as well.

review/text: I bought this for myself and it is everything I dreamed of...coffee!<br />Unlike some of the other reviews that stated the one they received were random cups thrown haphazardly in a box, the one I received was nicely packaged. Mine came in two boxes of 35 each and I think it is nice enough to wrap and give as presents. There is a nice variety among coffee brands such as Wolfgang Puck, Coffee People, Green Mountain, Caribou Coffee, etc. There are some flavors that are great and others that don't do it for me, but that is why I bought it. I wanted to try variety without commitment. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try different varieties or to give to a coffee lover as a gift.

Some flavored, some single-sourced, some blends - you won't know what you're getting for sure but you're sure to find something you'll like.<br /><br />Downside: you might get some decaf.  :)  You might also get some non-coffee K-cups like tea, hot chocolate, cider, etc. that you might not like.

Anyway, a really great purchase if you don't necessarily don't want the same coffee every day.

review/text: Really liked the variety pack.  Could do with fewer teas and decafs but overall was a good variety.  I get bored with the 50 cups of the same coffee which is mostly all I can find in the stores.  Don't understand why sellers don't offer more of these variety packs.  Put together a variety pack of nothing but different selections of coffee (no decaf) and I'll buy it regularly.

review/text: Im very happy I took a chance and ordered this.  There were indeed 70 different cups.  Only two iced which is great because while I love iced coffee, my Keurig doesnt make it.  There was a great balance of flavored lighter roasts and more bold, darker roasts.  There were several from the same brand, like green mountain coffee, but all different flavors.  There were also several brands I have seen before, so that's exciting.  It was packaged very nicely.  Overall I'm very happy and will order again when these are gone.

review/text: The picture associated with this product is a little misleading as the assortment of k-cups just come in a brown shipping box.  I did receive one k-cup of 91 separate varieties (although I probably got 10 different hazelnuts and a bunch of french roasts just by different manufacturers).  The limited edition print was kind of strange to me (a beetle and a coffee bean with a solid white background) but didn't influence my decision to purchase this variety pack (I was sold solely on the coffee assortment) so I don'thave much of an opinion on it.  Overall, it's a good variety at a great price!

review/text: I really was bummed to open my package and find nearly a fourth of the k-cups were decaf. I was happy to see this product and really hoped it would work out for me. I expected a few, but really at almost 25%, I felt I'd been given a disproportionate amount. I don't drink decaf at all but I figured if I got a couple I'd give them to people at work. At the end of the day with that amount of decaf in the mix it will work out cheaper for me to go to an Ebay seller that allows buyers to pick their own flavors. Packaging was good however.

review/text: Yes, Indeed, there are 70 different K-Cups in two attractive 35-count boxes.  Every cup is a different type, but I would say that it was 1/4 Decaf, and there were also many "nut" flavored roasts which may not be good for someone who has nut sensitivity. A good value and experience, I think it will let us find the ones we like the best and order those in single-type quantity in the future.

It's small (one half cup) but portion control is what I am working on so it helps with that.  It's real juice, and though it doesn't quite taste like Minute Maid or Tropicana Pure Premium, it's still yummy.  I would say it tastes like a slightly 'tropical' orange juice, as it has some passionfruit juice added to the orange and tangerine.  Wonderful tasting juice, maybe better than the name brands, you will love it and your kids will too!

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Poor chocolate, great filling!
review/text: I love dark chocolates, the darker the better. However unlike the many other Ghirardelli dark chocolates this one isn't good.<br /><br />The chocolate itself doesn't melt smooth, has bad mouth feel, and is absolutely flavorless. The chocolate actually reminds me of the poor tasting choco-bits in some ice creams, just waxy and lacking of flavor. And it doesn't even taste the same as their regular 60% chocolate. If Ghirardelli would have used the same chocolate as their other filled delights then it would actually taste really good.<br /><br />The caramel filling is the only redeeming quality of the chocolate. Smooth, full flavored, and not overly sticky (like some chocolate makers tend to use).<br /><br />Overall this is a poor quality chocolate that is waxy and flavorless with the only good thing being the caramel filling. Ghirardelli really dropped the ball on this one and am a bit surprised that they allowed it out on the market.<br /><br />My recommendation, buy a different flavor or brand, this is definitely not Ghirardelli at their best.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Caramel filling tastes great.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Waxy, doesn't melt well.<br />The chocolate itself is flavorless.

review/text: The product description says: "Keta Salmon Caviar is from the select roe of the Keta Salmon, which has very large eggs with a color that can range from bright red to brilliant orange."<br /><br />The caviar I received consisted of really small eggs (about half the size of those at a sushi restaurant) that are mushy, and taste awful. Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them. I had a "taste test" with my cat and dog, who *love* caviar) and they both turned their noses up at it. NOT a good sign.  :-(

review/summary: Salmon Roe Caviar
review/text: Few months ago, I bout salmon roe caviar in three different variety ( American salmon caviar, Canadian salmon caviar, and Russian salmon caviar) for try from GourmetFoodStore . They are delivered via express mail in cold pack. The products are all fresh and good condition. They are all taste as it should be, how ever the American product was better than Canadian product in my taste buds but the Russian product were even better for my taste buds.<br />In view of these, I recommend all of the product equally, but Russian is my choice for my taste buds.

review/text: Ordered malossol salmon caviar, received some orange mess in a regular green tin. Brave soul that I am - I have actually tried this nonsense. It does not come even close to resembling what a fresh, properly handled caviar should taste like. If I am still alive in 2 hours I guess you can call it "edible".

review/summary: Makes your AVs flower all year round and lasts forever!
review/text: I'm amazed at the impact this has on my african violets (I've added a picture above). I was lazy for a couple of months and just watered them without the plant food. I thought the lack of flowers was due to the season. But once I started feeding them again they bloomed in no time, and it was still low-light winter so I'm positive the change was due to the plant food.<br /><br />You only use a few drops at a time, so this stuff truly lasts forever.<br /><br />My boyfriend usually thinks plants/flowers are a waste of time, but the other day he looked at the african violets and spontaneously admitted that "they are actually pretty nice... they're always flowering, it's pretty amazing."

A tip:  Water your violets approximately every other day and never let them stand in water.  Better to let them get little dry than to over water.  And they will flourish on a window sill with the proper light.

It's supposed to be at a low enough level that it won't harm the roots, but to be on the cautious side, I switched to Dynagro.  My AVs did do well on Schultz, and if I run out of the other, I wouldn't hesitate to use it.

Last night, though, I created a lot of fried rice and then made a chicken stir fry (with fresh vegetables and aromatics).<br /><br />To top it off, I added a drizzle of this to my portion of stir fry over the fried rice. The instructions, after all, note that "This spicy oil is delicious drizzled over dishes just before serving." And it added a nice subtle spiciness to the portion.<br /><br />So, I am a satisfied user and will emply this to top off my next stir fry (or the leftovers, indeed, from the stir fry t5hat I made last night).

review/text: Someone left a snide comment on the first review about "Packaging" reviews being inappropriate on the Product reviews page. Are you aware that Amazon has no provision for Packaging reviews except when the product is shipped by Amazon?<br /><br />Needless to say - this is about packaging. I am giving 4 stars because I haven't tasted the wine yet, but it smells pretty good, as evidenced by the wine-soaked packaging. Here is (most) of what I said to the supplier:<br /><br />"It was shipped as two bottles wrapped in bubble wrap and securely taped into an envelope marked "Fragile". The Post Office hit the end of the bundle on something which dented and partly unscrewed the metal caps. Both bottles leaked. A photo is attached. Can't you do a better job of packaging these glass bottles? I'm sure that if you charged an extra dollar but securely packed the bottles in a box this would never have happened. I don't want my money back - I just want you to do a better job in future."<br /><br />I also provided the same photo that I posted here on Amazon. Enough said.

review/summary: Rich coffee flavor!
review/text: I like to drink XO Caf&eacute; neat in a shot glass - no ice, not mixed with other liquor, or not even with coffee. No fuss, no muss. Unlike other coffee liqueurs such as Baileys or Kahl&uacute;a, it's not so sweet and syrupy that it needs to be mixed. I enjoy the deep rich color of XO Caf&eacute; as light reflects off it, displaying amber hues toward the edge of the glass, making it even more pleasing to the eye than it was in the bottle.<br /><br />A sniff of this and you can't help but detect the predominant coffee aroma. But breathe in deeply and the smoky, woody notes of tequila come through. Why would anyone want to mask such deliciousness in a mixed drink? Now, if you prefer perhaps more of the tequila and less of the coffee, I would suggest what is called a "Bullfighter" - half a shot of good quality silver tequila with half a shot of XO Caf&eacute;. But for me, it's all about the coffee. And I couldn't be more pleased with XO Caf&eacute;.<br /><br />I think what surprised me the most was the surprisingly dry finish. There's just a hint of sweetness, but like a good dark chocolate where the rich chocolate is not masked by sugar, the light sweetness of XO Caf&eacute; does not crowd out the flavor of coffee. It's just enough to make it luxuriously smooth, with a balanced medium-weight body, highlighted by notes of tequila in the background. There's a slight burn, but not so much that I feel like I'm throwing back tequila shots like a college student. It's more sophisticated and refined, and as such, one shot of this after dinner is more than satisfying for me.

review/text: I love this product, and have been using it for nearly 30 years. This dark soy sauce is perfect for Chinese "red" dishes, items that are braised or cooked, pot roasts! Many reviewers complain about the bitter and unusual taste of this sauce when they use it at the table. I never use it the table or directly on finished food, salad or rice; it's more of a "COOKING" soy sauce. Use regular soy sauce for the table and enjoy the black or dark in your cooked foods.

review/summary: Do you like Bitter?  Do you like Scummy?
review/text: Unfortunately, I remembered the name but couldnot figure out what was wrong, so I ordered the minimum, two expensive large bottles.  I tried the sodium deficient, bitter soy product at every meal with various dishes and on solo vegetables.  Today, I trashed one expensive open bottle because scummy is the after taste.  Don't buy this product.<br /><br />I normally love Commercial Soy Sauce.
