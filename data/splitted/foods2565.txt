review/text: This wishbone salad dressing is becoming one of my favorites! I primarily use it as a dressing on vegetable salads, like cucumber, pasta or bean salads. I prefer the Red Wine Vinaigrette over any of the other vinaigrette versions by Wishbone, which just aren't as good as this one.<br /><br />Home-made vinaigrette is best, but this Wishbone is the next best thing! I purchase the 36-ounce size from Sam's which I find to be the best price. Yet it tastes much more expensive than it is.<br /><br />Pass on the yucky fat-free versions and use this one in moderation. Enjoy!

review/summary: MSG In Ranch
review/text: This product has MSG in it. I felt stupid because after all the " Naturally helps absorb vitamins A & E; Naturally rich in Omega 3 ALA**; No High Fructose Corn Syrup", they still use Mono-sodium Glutamate- MSG. I hate Wishbone now and will tell anyone who loves salad to avoid them at all costs.<br /><br />PS I checked the website for their explanation for this and read, "WE only use MSG when we feel it's necessary for taste"--- Isn't that why everyone used it, before health experts found it to be toxic!<br /><br />Do whats right for yourself and your family--- Avoid this Company!!!

review/text: I picked these up one day at PETCO and was amazed.  My two dogs went NUTS over them.  If they even hear the bag they come running.  Whoever came up with this recipe knows what dogs like!  One of my dogs is older and can't chew as well and the softness is particularly great for him.

review/summary: Great for my picky dog
review/text: I have a JRT who is very picky about treats.  He loves these.  I like that there's no corn syrup here as in many soft treats.  The best thing about these is they're soft enough to mold around his pills and he just gulps them down!

review/summary: He liked them...
review/text: I have a 10 year old, rescued, toy poodle and apparently his previous owners taught him to beg for people food. I do not feed dogs people food but I feel so bad when he sits in the floor and begs while we eat dinner at the table. So I bought these to give him when he begs. He also has tooth issues, so I needed them to be soft. He liked it and wanted more, but he seems to like another one (of the same brand) better that is chicken liver flavored. My only issue is I paid 8 dollarsish for these on amazon and found them the day before my delivery arrived at Petsmart for less than $5. Will be purchasing there from now on.

review/summary: Her Favorite Treat
review/text: My Havanese puppy (5 mos old) loves these treats.  We have used them for potty training.  When she goes out side rather than inside we do a clap and she gets a gooberlicious--actually its about 1/3 of one becuase we cut them up for training at home.  I do not use them for obedience training because the cut up ones are too crumbly to keep in my pocket.  For a larger dog you could probably use the full size treat.  They last well in the bag provided.

review/summary: My dog did not flip over for Gooberlicious!
review/text: I first bought this because my puppy never had any peanut butter flavored treats and it was on sale at petsmart. I was expecting small pieces but the pieces from the 10 oz. pack were the size of a real peanut. He ate the first 4 to 5 pieces but afterward he ignored it entirely. He refuses to do tricks for this treat. For the longest time I had no idea why. I did some research on dog treats and food. What's healthy and what's not. I soon realized that this is made with Chicken By-Product Meal...which is a BIG NO NO.<br /><br />On top of that it doesn't smell good. Every time I touch it my hand it would reek of this treat. Not a pleasant experience for me and my puppy.

review/summary: Hubba Bubba Squeeze Pop, Assorted Sour Lollipops, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 18)
review/text: As a 30 year type 1 diabetic, I have had, more than I care to think about, many occasions of low blood sugar. Like 25,28,35,46....  This can kill you.  At times like that, I need some glucose IMMEDIATELY if not sooner.<br />I have the glucose tabs...dozens of them, but sometimes when you really need them, none can be found.<br /><br />These Hubba Bubba squeeze tubes work FANTASTIC..for me. They are resealable with the cap, so I can take the amount I need and save the rest for later. They last a long time, I mean they aren't going to melt or spoil. I carry them in our cars, within reach of my bed...scattered throughout our home...in the pocket of my cargo pants....everywhere.<br />When I need them...I NEED THEM.<br /><br />This product has saved me more times than I can remember...and they taste good too.<br />I've noticed that many people just plain like them for their intended purpose.  Sour or sweet candy.<br /><br />Locally at a gas station, I pay $1.29 + tax for each tube and have seen them at $1.59. I save a bit and buy this box of 18 at Amazon. Many have stated that this product can be hard to find. Well - go to Amazon.com and buy a box and save a little over buying individually.<br /><br />I rate this product 5 stars, because without them, I might not be rating anything....ever again.  :-)

review/summary: Fabulous pasta -- and HEALTHY too (!).
review/text: This isn't just healthy pasta (although it is that).  It's delicious!!!  My husband, who totally hates whole-wheat pasta (he'll eat whole-wheat bread, if pushed against the wall, but absolutely holds out against whole-wheat pasta) adores this.  He prefers it to any other pasta.  Now, if it's out of stock at the store, he grumbles and won't buy his old favorite brands as a substitute.  I love that it tastes so good that we can serve a healthy spaghetti dinner for unsuspecting company without anyone asking what on earth we did to the food.  We're thrilled to see that it will soon be available on Amazon so we can stock up!

review/summary: Probably the best tasting instant coffee around!
review/text: I have tried Member's Mark 100% Colombian instant coffees (both the regular and decaf version) and all I can say is WOW!!!  This is how instant coffee should be!  No bitter, astringent, chicory or corn-like after taste. In fact, no bad or nasty aftertaste at all that lingers in your mouth much like all the other instant coffees I've tasted and tried--- and I've tasted many, including the more popular brands like Nescafe Classic/Gold/Taster's Choice House Blend/Taster's Choice 100% Colombian, Yuban 100% Arabica Instant Coffee, Maxwell House, Folgers etc.<br /><br />Those used to popular commercial brands of instant coffees will probably initially perceive this coffee as lacking in bitterness or strength but don't be misled by the 'bitter = stronger/more concentrated' deception of many popular instant coffee brands! This coffee is far from 'diluted' in taste. It has simply the best flavor and aroma in any instant coffee I've ever tried!  If you want a stronger or weaker coffee, just add more or less teaspoons to a cup.  This is one instant coffee that will never make your cup too bitter so as to become undrinkable.  Simply the best there is in instant coffee!  Made from 100% arabica coffee beans with no inferior, bitter-tasting, robusta coffee added whatsoever.  You owe it to yourself to try this coffee and taste the difference 100% arabica coffee makes!  This is the taste that you've been missing for from your instant coffee. Now you don't have to drink brewed coffee all the time just because commercial instant coffees taste so bad! Also available at a much cheaper price at Sam's Club and Costco membership stores.

review/text: We took in a starving little ferrel kitten almost 2 years ago that we eventually discovered has digestive problems and allergies to corn, wheat, soy and fillers.. We live in a rural area where we don't have a lot of choices in pet foods. We kept trying all kinds of natural foods available at Walmart, Kmart, etc., trying to find one that worked for him, but nothing worked. We finally found Diamond's natural's at our local Tractor Supply and decided to give it a try.. It's the one that worked! Our little "pew" kitty is now pretty much gas free, his cat box isn't full of it (if you get my drift) and he's doing beautifully. He's a huge cat with silky smooth long hair. On the plus side, Diamond Natural's are made in the USA! We also switched our dog to Diamond's natural because he also has allergies to corn, wheat, soy and fillers.. His fur is thicker and softer and he isn't chewing non stop like he was before.. Plus he loves the food! We use Diamond Naturals Lamb and Rice formula for him. Don't confuse the Diamond's Maintenance with the Diamond's Natural's, though.. The Maintenance formula's do include corn and fillers... If your pet has allergies, make sure you purchase the Naturals!

review/text: I had previously been feeding my three kittens the Trader Joe seafood formula which they have liked with no complaints. I noticed however that it was mostly corn based and wanted to try something healthier and more natural for my brood. I started acclimating them to the new Chicken & Rice Formula by mixing the old and new half and half. My siamese, who is very fickle, decided she liked Diamond Naturals the best and refused to eat anything "mixed" preferring to switch immediately to the new food. My shorthair and manx love it too. In the big 18lb bag at a great price, I have no complaints and have been very pleased.

review/text: Until I see a feline plucking berry's to munch on I'm sticking to a high protein dry food without all the fruits, vegetables and chemical additives. This is my top pick as far as kibble. The kittens are thriving on it. I've tried all the expensive foods that appeals to the buyer with fruits and veggies and they'd rather starve then eat it. The most marked difference between this food and the foods with lesser protein is they eat less because their daily protein requirement is being fulfilled.

review/text: I bought this to feed a few feral cats.  They absolutely dislike it.  Before buying this food, I'd have to refill their bowls with their usual brand at least twice a day.  I now fill the bowls in the morning and there is still food there at night.  The ingredients look decent, it doesn't have a bad odor but for some reason they just won't eat it.  I gave it two stars instead of one because it also temporarily solved a problem I had with racoons.  The racoons didn't like it either and stopped coming around to make a mess on my back porch.

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: I have relatively mixed feelings about this cat food. For one, the food itself has a stronger smell than some other cat foods I've bought before. I suppose that's not a bad thing since the cats can smell it, but I personally don't really care for the smell.<br /><br />Our cats seem to like the taste of it and don't voice any complaints. However, one of our two cats has a more sensitive stomach - and after eating this food she's had litterbox issues a few times - deciding to do her business right outside the litterbox in a rather non-solid mess. Our other cat has done fine, but the smell in the litterbox has been nothing short of awful when she forgets to cover up after doing her business.<br /><br />Overall, I don't really care for this product and probably won't buy it again. But it seems like a better choice over store-brand and other cheap dry food that's full of fillers.

Although none of the additional products being recalled have tested positive for Salmonella, the company is pulling them from store shelves as a precaution. Diamond Pet Foods is coordinating efforts with federal and state health and regulatory agencies and decided to independently expand the recall to ensure the safety and well-being of customers and their pets.<br /><br />The company stated: "We have taken corrective actions at our Gaston, S.C., facility and voluntarily expanded the recall out of concern for our customers and their pets."<br /><br />Brands included in the recall include:<br /> *Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul<br />*Country Value<br />*Diamond<br />*Diamond Naturals<br />*Premium Edge<br />*Professional<br />*4Health<br />*Taste of the Wild<br /><br />To determine if their pet food is recalled, consumers should check the production code on their bag. If the code has a "2" or "3" in the 9th position AND an "X" in the 10th or 11th position, the product is affected by the recall.

review/summary: Cats still skepticle, though I am firm.
review/text: I have been giving this to my cats for nearly two years on an off and on basis. I feel this is healthier than some of the other foods, I can afford. I do have one pan of this, and one pan of the other good brand I have been feeding. The cats don't seem to eat as much when I feed only Diamond brand. Two are in let's say early stages of obesity, and the other two are trim. They all hunt, and three are very active, the fourth is also considering his age. He can certainly move when he needs to, he escaped the close teeth of a pit bull a couple weeks ago. The pan of the other food will soon be replaced with Diamond brand as soon as that last bag is gone. I think their coats, and health is a good testament for the Diamond brand food. It even looks good to me, no I am not about to try it, but it looks richer.

review/text: I tried feeding my cats this food for about a month, but it apparently caused diarrhea in 2 of my 9 cats.  I slowly mixed this food into their old over the course of a week or so as directed.  The diarrhea did not improve until I switched them off this food a couple of weeks later.  When I went back to a different brand, I didn't do it gradually, and the problems quickly resolved.  I do think the food has good ingredients as far as dry foods are concerned, and all the cats seemed to like it.

review/summary: Instant resolution of food allergy
review/text: One of our 2 cats developed an apparent food allergy (lots of vomiting) to the Friskies dry food we had been feeding them. Doing research I found that the corn and soy included in such cheap cat food kibbles is often a culprit. Switched to Diamond and the GI distress immediately vanished and hasn't returned. Our mildly fussy cats immediately took to the new food which I supplement with a little liver and nutritional yeast. Both cats seem to be thriving on it with glistening coats and no illnesses whatever.

review/summary: Weak, flavorless brew
review/text: I'm very disappointed in this coffee.  I can't understand the positive reviews I've read for this variety.  The best I can say is it's not objectionable, but then again, neither is hot water.  This was a waste of money.  It might be OK with cream and sugar, but I generally don't add those to a dark roast coffee.  Really, this stuff is so weak, it's like you took a nice strong cup of coffee and diluted it 1:1 with hot water.  I loved the Eclipse blend, but Amazon doesn't sell that one except through 3rd parties.  I took a gamble on this non-Extra Bold variety and lost.  I'll reserve 1 star for something that tastes bad, rather than simply flavorless.  My brewer cannot brew a cup smaller than 8 oz, so I'm stuck with these.  Maybe I can give them away on Freecycle.<br /><br />I much prefer Tully's French Roast, Van Houtte Eclipse, or Gloria Jeans Black Gold.  I'll never again buy a non-flavored k-cup that isn't Extra Bold.

review/text: I've become addicted to Acadian buckwheat pancakes ("ployes") from Bouchard Family Farms ([...]).  I purchased the Hunter & Hilsberg mix because I was looking for a similar product on Amazon that I could prepare by adding only water.  Overall, I'm quite happy with this mix.  There are several preparation options depending on what one wants to make: pancakes (add egg and water), cr�pes/flapjacks (add water), and waffles (add water, beaten eggs, and shortening).  I have not tried these with egg, but I find that they are surprisingly fluffy with water alone.  Personally, I wish they were a little more bitter, but I suspect most people would be happy with the buckwheat flavour exactly as it is.

The size of these cereal packages is so much better than those little 8-12 box packs (for hungrier college age kids). Also, the cup serves as a terrific way to minimize having to wash any dishes or bowls as they serve as their own little disposable containers. Perfect for kids living away from home. Throw in the fact that Amazon will deliver it for free, and also runs special promotions every once in a while, makes these an unbeatable value. The fact that these are Froot Loops are just icing on the cake!

review/summary: It's Helping Clear my Acne/ I wrote a lot but its worth reading if u suffer from acne
review/text: The Manuka Honey 12+ In my opinion is really good for clearing bad acne. I use it as a cleanser for my face. Starting after the Holidays of last year 2009, after New Years My skin broke out really bad. So i was beginning 2010 with skin that was going out of control. I started using Acne free which contains 2.5 Benzoyl Peroxide which has helped clear my skin in the past but it actually made it worst. then I started using Herpanacine 100 vegicaps supplements and that really broke me out to the max. I had big acne cysts around my jaw line. so I realized the supplements is supposed to do that and it's because i had toxins in my body. Then I started using [...] products because they also use 2.5 BP which helped me before. But I noticed my skin looked dull and tho it was clearing i just hate the fact using chemicals for the rest of my life to help clear my acne. then I used mario Badescu products. i was just willing to find anything to help... so I wanted a natural alternative. i was sick of using chemicals. I found a youtube page where this lady cleared her acne with organic raw honey and a aloe vera plant. so I first bought the 365 Organic Raw Honey from wholefoods which is AWESOME!! which i still use. then she mentioned the manuka raw organic 12+.. so i had to try it.. within three weeks my skin was glowing.  So I wash my face with either honey, the 365 organic wildflower Raw honey or  wedderspoon raw organic manuka honey 12+.. then pat dry. then at night I use the gel from a aloe vera plant. not aloe vera juice or gels they sell in stores in a container. it's best to use the actual plant and use the gel it has. rub it on your face everynight. it helps with the redness and complexion. it really help make my skin glow. another thing i do as a skin regimen is add 3 tsp of 365 organic raw honey with 1 tsp of cinnamon powder and mix as a paste. i use that as a face mask. put it where u have acne for two weeks! it really works.. i still use it and it helps clear really fast.wash it off after 30 min to 2hrs. another thing that really HELPS!!! is juicing cucumber with apple or pears.. but the main ingredient is the CUCUMBER..to making ur own juice using a blender or a juicer. it's really helping clear my  acne. hope it helps u! i added the links below that is saving my skin! good luck!<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Light colored and moderate flavored Manuka
review/text: I originally bought Manuka when visiting Australia and it was much more medicinal tasting, strongly piney-flavored,and dark amber colored. So if you look at other reviews of Manuka honey exported to the United States, you have to wonder whether or not this is the traditional Manuka honey sold in New Zealand. Maybe North American sugary sweet-loving sensibilities preclude us from buying the harsher tasting dark Manuka honeys. I am no expert and am not sure about this observation, except to trust this label. With that said, this honey tastes wonderfully sweet, rich and mellow, is thick and creamy, with a slight hint of a deep piney flavor as a topnote. This is the sugar and the medecine rolled into one! I like the fact that it is organic as well. I also bought the higher active UMF level <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK08OC">Wedderspoon Raw Organic Organic Manuka Honey Active 16+, 17.6-Ounce Jar</a>

review/text: I'm not the type who buys a lot of stuff like this, but I read an article in a magazine extolling its benefits and I thought I'd give it a try.  Now I'm a believer.  I'm back to buy my second jar.  I add a spoonful to my tea every morning, and I just feel good all day.  I have lots more energy, and this from a mom with a large farmhouse to take care of, a part-time job, active volunteer jobs and a new puppy (I'm really busy).  Plus I did not get sick at all this winter, which is amazing to me.  My husband and daughter caught colds, plus I volunteer at the school library so I'm exposed to lots of germs, but if I felt like something was coming on I doubled my dose and it never turned into anything.  I also put it on my finger where a splinter turned into an infection, and one day later it was all better - more effective than neosporin. I also have had less adult acne than before - despite a lot of stress (my trigger).<br />The taste is so-so, better than medicine but not as tasty as regular honey.  I wouldn't buy it as a sweetener, I consider it a useful supplement that doesn't taste offensive.  But bottom-line, I'm back for more.

The product arrived promptly and in excellent condition.<br /><br />One thing I would have changed would be the Active + number: I think I should have purchased the 16+ instead and will do so in the future.

At the onset of the first symptom of cold or flu or sore throat, immediately start the honey dosage.<br /><br />The dosage that we have successfully used is 1/3rd tea spoon, 4-5 times a day during a cold/flu/sore throat episode.<br /><br />In addition to this, we use fresh, raw, crushed garlic with food or any other way. These two (honey & garlic) when used together simply form a winning combination averting the requirement for antibiotics.

review/text: I only wish I had taken pictures - the improvement is hard to believe!  About a month ago I was diagnosed with cellulitis on the heel of my foot.  The usual treatment antibiotics and ointment.  I completed the round of antibiotics and my foot actually seemed to be improving.  A week later it was worse and getting worse by the minute.  I really didn't want to do another round of antibiotics so I started looking for alternatives.  I read about honey.  Apparently, honey has amazing healing properties.  It's been used for centuries.  My reading introduced me to manuka honey from New Zealand.  I read a lot of articles on the internet and started looking for places to purchase.  When I found it available on Amazon I read the reviews.  I didn't read a bad one so I decided to purchase.  I am so glad I did.  I've been using the honey for 8 days and the improvement is amazing!  I have 2 small open sores left and almost all the dead skin has peeled away (sounds gross, I know).  I slather the honey on my heel twice a day and cover with guaze.  This stuff is amazing!  One of the reviews I read was from a woman with adult acne.  She uses the honey all the time to scrub her face.  My 30 yr old daughter has adult acne.  She's going to start using the honey too.

review/text: Honey was never a staple in this avid tea drinker's cup and nor had I ever heard of Manuka Honey. I am always looking to better myself from inside out, so I have to credit Shape magazine's interview with Khloe Kardashian for cluing me in to this wonder in a jar.  According to her, Khloe found that ingesting the honey during cold season boosts her immune system.<br /><br />The honey is a pleasant, golden color with a sweet aroma and taste to match; a little goes a long way! I enjoyed the light, sweet taste it brought to my tea. However, I do not always use it since it carries 70 calories per serving. Best of all -- as other reviewers have mentioned -- Manuka honey doubles for more than eating.  I use less than half a teaspoon of the honey as a face mask.  First I boil water and steam my face for about 2 minutes, then I apply the honey in gentle, circular motions.  I steam again for at least 3 minutes, then leave it on for 15-20 minutes. This has not caused me to break out, rather it has cleared up what could have been a pimple or two.  Don't try this if you are allergic, though.

review/text: Some one recommended this honey to me so I wanted to give it a try. Honey is known good for immune system, stomach, and skins. Drinking honey lemon water in the morning helps improving skin's condition. This honey is not like the regular honey you see in the supermarket. It has a unique texture and great taste. Dissolve easily in water. I had a cold before and I drank tea with this honey and I felt much better afterwards! Great product!

review/summary: Interesting flavor
review/text: I love jerkey, and I've been trying out all of the halal jerkey from this company because overall I have to say it is some great jerkey.  This particular flavor, I can see where they were going with this, the rosemary does have a strong flavor that should have really produced a good taste in the meat, but somehow I feel the flavor pairing doesn't really work that well here.  The garlic might be a bit soft here and the sweetness overwhelms the rosemary.  Still, the meat quality is high, if you want to try something different I would order one, but still the favorite has to be between the hot hickory or the hot n sweet.

review/text: After sampling the Halaal jerky at the ISNA conference, I was hooked! It was jerky heaven--so soft it was like melting in my mouth. I thought, OK I'd pay $6/bag for jerky this good. So I ordered up a bunch from here and I could not believe the jerky I got was from the same makers. So far 3/7 bags have been like eating cardboard. I'm thinking I got jipped and got sent old jerky! $6 for a few pieces of cardboard jerky in a bag is such a rip off! I was really disappointed with the quality they sent me! I will NOT be ordering again.

review/summary: Great Salt, Good price
review/text: I bought a pound of this salt and I love it.  It is a great finishing salt, very delicate and flavorful.  Gets lost in the pan, so save it for the final splash.  It comes in a zip top bag for storage.  It is medium fine grain and small flakes, moist and white to slightly grey.  The package says Premium, Fine, No. II by Le Tresor.  I have had better salt direct from Guerande, but it cost more.

Ultra fresh!  Ultra good!  The only problem with this chip is it is very difficult to eat a small portion because they are so tasty!  IMO this is the highest quality potato chip on the market right now that I am aware of.

review/summary: Some Tasty Chips
review/text: Ok- this sounds greedy, but one day, a friend and I were out for a nightly stroll; you know, getting our exercise on.  We came to this health food store, where I bought these for the first time.  Um.... I finished the whole bag before we got back to her house, and then I came here an ordered a whole damn box of these.<br /><br />These are the lightest chips I have ever tasted.  They are not greasy at all - and have just the right amount of seasoning on them.  For anyone who has ever fried anything in coconut oil, you might agree that foods you fry simply turn out crispy and light.  I am assuming this is the same case for avocado oil, and we see this in the taste of this chip.<br /><br />Oh, that box of chips - lasted me about a week.  Ya, OINK!  Enjoy yours.

review/text: These are my new favorite potato chips.  I bought a bag out of curiosity when I saw them at my local organic/health foods supermarket.  The avocado oil gives them a light and refreshing taste.  They have a perfect crunchiness as well.<br /><br />I am a little disappointed about the price here though.  I bought my 5 oz. bag for $2.30 at the supermarket.  Buying them in bulk here is more expensive.  Looks like I'll just stick to getting them at the store.

review/text: The package promises that avacado oil has nutritional benefits, such as its effect on good versus bad fats and cholesterol. Certainly, the use of avacado oil does not harm the taste (maybe it contributes, but I am not sure that I would be able to detect that).<br /><br />The Barcelona barbecue taste is quite nice. The kettle style of preparation really produces a tasty chip.<br /><br />Nutrition? Total fat is less than standard potato chips (e.g., Lay's); lower saturated fat; no trans fat. Sodium is not too high.<br /><br />All in all--a nice combination of good taste and halfway decent nutrition (I doubt that any chip will be designated a health food in the near future!).<br /><br />I'd recommend this.

review/summary: A Savory Sweet Spice for your Crab & Shrimp Dishes
review/text: This wonderful spice makes it easy to put a different spin on your seafood cooking because it's an incredibly easy spice to use. It contains wine solids and very little salt (yeah!). We've bought these small 1-ounce packets for years, so we were very happy when we accidentally stumbled upon the big restaurant/institutional-sized jars <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5158">Cajun King New Orleans Style Barbecue Shrimp Seasoning Mix, 20-Ounce Plastic Containers (Pack of 2)</a>. They were a great bargain compared to the packets, but we wondered if the ingredients were the same? Turns out they're slightly different (e.g., jars have sauterne wine, packets have chablis), but thankfully, the tastes are actually identical.<br /><br />Both the jars and the packets have cooking instructions that recommend completely covering the seafood with a layer of pepper. (Maybe to make it 'cajun hot'?) Yikes! No thanks, here's our recipe; toss your crab, shrimp, scallops, vegetables, etc...into a baking dish. Melt 1 stick of butter and pour it over the seafood. Generously sprinkle on the spice. (Additional seasonings are optional; salt, pepper, garlic, onions & lemon slices). Bake for 25-30 minutes at 375 degrees. Done & Delicious! Enjoy...<br /><br />If you're going to make this dish often, get the big jars and save big money!<br /><br />Please check out the photos we've uploaded.

review/text: When I saw that the Jumbo size can of corn was available, it made me incredibly happy. I was immediately flooded with all my childhood memories of eating canned corn. Good times! Sadly this did not translate well for me in my first marriage. You see I really enjoy eating the corn right out of the can unheated. But problem was I watch TV late at night in bed and if I'm watching TV, I'm eating corn. Plus I spill a lot, that and falling asleep while eating. Let's just say it can be messy. I was more wise in my choice for second wife.I met her at the carnival, she works there. It takes a big person to love a 680lb woman, but that's me, big hearted all-the -way. And, wink wink, she doesn't care if I spill food in the bed!

review/summary: Great spicy snack.
review/text: This is a great value for people who enjoy seaweed.  It has a great spicy flavor, but the taste of the seaweed is not lost.  Just be aware, 100 packets is a lot of seaweed.  Each strip is 3.5 inches long.

review/summary: Great Seaweed Product
review/text: This seaweed and the msg free seaweed are great products.  This one has a nice spicy bite.  I love seaweed plain and with these flavored products I have gone to heaven.  I have been eating seaweed since I was 5 years old.  I was a picky eater, but now I am not.  Nori has great nutrients and is low cal and has high protein.  It is a perfect food.  This is just another great way to taste it and consume it.  I can eat more of the nori if I have the msg variety.  Nori is a good thing to eat a great deal of.  This taste is good.

review/summary: Pleasantly Disappointed, and Then Very Please.
review/text: Seeing the good reviews on this page, and hearing of the health benefits of this product - I decided to try it out. This page suggests that the product has a spicy flavor, and I was mildly disappointed to find out that it did not. However, I am still very pleased with the product. It is very delicious. I intend to get this product again in the future and recommend it to everyone.

review/summary: Great snack, the kids love it!
review/text: This roasted nori has a lite, spicy flavor that our kids love.  We take lots of packets with us when we go out just about anywhere, because they're healthy and we don't mind letting the kids have as many as they want when they ask for a snack - especially compared to nasty, processed, non-nutritive kids' snacks like chips, cheese puffs, cheese crackers, etc.  If you've never had nori, this is the same stuff that sushi rolls are wrapped in - it's just served crispy here because it hasn't absorbed any moisture from the rice and sushi roll that it is otherwise wrapped around.<br /><br />There are lots of health benefits to eating nori, and the light spicy flavor in the Ajitsuke brand is just right - give it a shot, you'll like it!

review/summary: Consistency isn't the same
review/text: I purchased this in late Oct and thoroughly enjoyed it. I quickly ordered 2 more packages in early November and received what was absolutely disgusting and tasteless. I can say the consistency isn't always the same, so beware. I've been quite satisfied with Sea's Gift which I would highly recommend to everyone.

review/summary: Love it or Hate It!
review/text: I really love these seaweed snacks, although every one else that I have given them to try has disliked them.  I think they are a real "love it or hate it" sort of item.<br /><br />If you like the seaweed in sushi, then you would probably like these strips.  They are more like dry paper because they are very thin.  The strips are quite salty with a little bit of spice.  At first they are crispy, but they become soft when chewed.  I usually eat two packets (8 strips total) at a time.<br /><br />I do think the price is high, so I'm not sure when I will buy them again.  Right now, I'm eating them every day and they are a great little snack.  Love it!

review/summary: Num Yummy~
review/text: This is my very first time tasting seaweed and I must say that I'm very disappointed.... that they are gone so quickly.I found that after eating them almost every day for a week, my body began to crave for it. And I cannot blame it, they are delicious and very good for you. These are a great snack if you are constantly on the go and fall prey to snack cravings, though it may take quite a few. They are great with rice, ramen, and soups. 200 may feel like a lot, but they will not last for long.  C:

review/summary: A tasty and nutritious snack
review/text: These seaweed snacks are very tasty and addictive. They're chewy with just the right amount of spicyness, and great as a snack for watching TV or movies -- a much healthier alternative to potato chips or buttered popcorn. It's 1.3 calories and 15mg sodium per packet, according to the nutrition label. Each packet has 3 pieces.<br /><br />You can eat these as is, or cut the strips horizontally into very thin pieces and sprinkle over rice, ramen, salads, and even pizza. Sprinkling shredded seaweed over food is a common topping style in Japan such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006G5KEY">JFC - Nori Fumi Furikake (Rice Seasoning) 1.7 Oz.</a>.<br /><br />100 bags is a lot, but don't be surprised if you find yourself eating 6-10 or more packets at a time. If you like seaweed snacks, you may also like Korean roasted and seasoned seaweed, though they are often much higher in sodium. Two very tasty brands I like are: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JPV4AO">ChoripDong Korean Seaweed Snack (Kim Nori), Roasted w/Olive oil & Sea Salted</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012JMSG2">Roasted Seasoned Seaweed: 3 Individual Packs</a>.

review/summary: Eh
review/text: It tastes "weird" and not in a good way. Like fish-tankish...There was tons of it...luckily my dogs love it, so I don't have to throw it away, and they get the minerals. I usually buy Sea's Gift. I tried Amy Chung's and it was waaaay too salty. I went back to Sea's Gift toasted and that's what I am sticking to.

review/text: My entire family, including my 7 year old daughter, absolutely love this product.  My kids take it in their lunches, and at first their friends were grossed out by the seaweed "ick" factor... until they tried it!<br /><br />The serving size of 3 packets is a satisfying (and healthy!) snack that contains pretty much the fewest calories of any snack I've ever eaten, yet is full of flavour.

review/summary: A delicious healthy snack
review/text: Nori is a tasty healthy snack.<br /><br />This nori comes in 100 individual cellophane packets. So you can put a few packs in a pocket or lunch box and have it with you when you want a snack.<br /><br />Why eat nori? Because it has all lots of trace minerals that your body needs.<br /><br />Best of all a serving of this nori has only four little calories. And this will not destroy your diet if you are on a diet. And you will be providing your body the minerals it needs any way.<br /><br />I have eaten nori that tastes a little better such as the nori by Annie Chung.<br /><br />This nori tastes good, very low in calories. And prepared In single serving packets to protect the nori from contamination. It is deffinately highly recommended.

review/text: I don't really like these.  I really like Annie's and Trader Joe's dried seaweed and was looking for a cheaper alternative, but this is not it.  It is not salty nor crunchy enough.
