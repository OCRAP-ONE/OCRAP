review/text: Saw it on the news and knew I had to try it. I'm a real peanut butter lover. Found it in Walmart today and bought a box. Immediately tried it when I got home. Yum yum! Tastes better than PB Captain Crunch. Headed out to buy a few more boxes now!

review/summary: Just "all right"
review/text: I got these thinking they seemed like a more respectable stand in for Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch which is my guilty pleasure cereal which I will hide from the kids and eat by the bucket once they are in bed.  The flavor is not as intense, and if you really compare the label, a 3/4 c. serving of each has the same grams of sugar.  The cheerios has 1 gram more fiber and none of the bad fat that the PPCC has but I feel like, given the trade-off of weaker peanut butter flavor, the increase in healthiness is very marginal.  They're also kind of pricey, for the box being so small.  (They're actually cheaper at my grocery store than on Amazon, but still have the "how small is this box???" thing going on)<br /><br />They're all right and I will buy them again if on sale or I have a coupon - but for what I hoped them to be, an honest to goodness healthy alternative to PBCC, they fall a little short.  If they could just oomph up the PB flavor a bit...<br /><br />If you really want a healthier version of PBCC, I think Peanut Butter Bumpers is the way to go - but they never seem to go on sale, grrr.

Great taste and I have been eating them with milk and as a snack.<br /><br />I think my niece and nephew are coming over to visit more often because the first thing they ask for is a bowl of Peanut Butter Cheerios. Haven't seen them in the grocery store yet. Will certainly buy more when I do. Yum!

review/summary: Fromm's is the best, my cats adore it!
review/text: My cats have had a go at every canned cat food on the market. While they liked some canned foods one week, they left the same brand  untouched the next week. I am tired of throwing away uneaten cat food!! The only brand all three cats eat right way, and keep eating until the plate is empty, is Fromm's. Fromm's costs more than other foods, but since the cats eat it all up, I am ahead money-wise. As if that weren't enough, the ingredients are healthier than the grocery store cat foods. The fact that I can feed all three cats a healthy, grain-free food they love is terrific. Try a can and watch your cat enjoy a great meal!

review/text: I'm always looking for healthy options when it comes to snacks for my children. My choice would apples and peanut butter or red pepper strips and hummus.  Unfortunately picky eaters with food allergies and sensitivities along with ongoing health issues can make snack time seem like a wrestling match.  When kids want to tear into the unhealthy snacks and mom is stuck being the referee; Annie's Organic Bunny Fruit Snacks Berry Patch are a reasonable compromise.  While they won't come close to the nutritional benefit of a truly healthy snack they do manage to provide 100% Vitamin C.  They are labeled as naturally gluten free, made with real fruit juices, no HFCS and are organic. We have tried the tropical treat flavor but my children prefer the Berry Patch.  We purchase them through the Amazon Subscribe and Save for a reasonable price.  Have your kids pin down a couple of small cheese cubes and a couple apple slices along with Annie's Fruit Snacks and mom feels as she wins too!

review/text: I really like the taste of these coffee pods.  The packaged arrive nicely packaged and quick.  The value was great considering subscribed to "subscribe & Save" and free ship with my Amazon Prime.  I paid only $22.90 for a package of 3 boxes of 16 pods per box.  So, that's $7.63 per box.  I was shopping at Super Walmart today and they offer these kind of coffee pods.  Every day price for this store is $9.84 per box.  So, Amazon.com does offer the better value!  However, I found a box of "cappuccino Ice" coffee pods on clearance for $2.00!  They were on clearance because the box expires 07/2011 and today is 08/02/2011.  I just brewed a glass and it tastes great!  I am happy to save money in tough financial times.

review/summary: I'm the envy of my coworkers
review/text: I have the Nescafe Dolce Gusto machine in my office (I have a regular espresso machine at home).  Since I don't usually sweeten my coffee drinks I wasn't sure if I would like this, but I bought 3 boxes anyway.  Turns out it's delicious.  It's not nearly as sweet as the Vanilla Latte at Starbucks, which is good.  The vanilla flavour is mild but still noticeable.  Smells great while brewing.  While I don't drink this every single day, when I do feel the urge for a treat, it saves me a long walk in the cold to Starbucks...but I find my coworkers just "happen" to come around a lot more when I'm making a latte...they need to get their own supply!

review/summary: Light hint of vanilla, smooth easy flavor
review/text: We've been trying all the different flavors for our new Dolce Gusto machine and this one is pretty darn good. I've never been a vanilla fan per se, but I really like the Vanilla Latte flavor. It has a very light, a mere hint really of vanilla in the milk. When the machine is steaming & applying the pressure to the milk pod, you get a faint aroma of vanilla as the mug fills. The flavor is delicate and doesn't overwhelm the rest of the coffee. I like a sweet drink so I have to add a hit of sugar to all of coffees, so while it says it's a lightly sweetened latte, they really mean LIGHTLY. The main thing I do like is that Nescafe is not using fake sweeteners (like splenda etc)so you don't get a funky aftertaste with any of the flavors. This Vanilla Latte is one we'll be ordering from Amazon in the three packs. (we've been buying each flavor in single boxes at the local W-Mart)

review/summary: Didn't meet expectations
review/text: I have only had my machine for about a month but I ordered the 3 pack of these vanilla latte macchiato because I kept adding vanilla flavoring to the cappuccino drinks.  I had very high expectations for these and I was disappointed.  My favorite drink is a skinny vanilla latte from Starbucks but these taste nothing like it.  They do have a weird processed vanilla flavor to them.  I LOVE the cappuccino drinks for the dolce gusto machine.  Don't order these if you want a vanilla flavored drink, just order the cappuccinos and some different flavorings to add to them.  My boyfriend, whose idea of coffee is QuikTrip Cappuccino loaded with sugar, likes these with a couple tablespoons of sugar dumped in.

review/summary: A box on the table keeps my jimmies stable
review/text: You have no idea how many times people ask me how I can stay so composed. When I tell them that it's because of my breakfast cereal, they just shake their heads in disbelief and continue to dog me for the real answer. But it's because of this cereal that I can accomplish anything. Not only does it have that zesty taste that people love, it's also got a gorilla. A GORILLA. You tell me when you last saw a gorilla on a cereal box. Look at that calm gorilla. He's composed, he's cool, he's confident, he's in the zone. He's not here to impress you, he's here to eat his cereal and scratch himself. Don't YOU want to be like that? Don't YOU want to be a gorilla?<br /><br />You have jimmies? You want them to keep from getting rustled?<br />Gorilla Munch is your answer.<br /><br />Keep a box on the table, and you'll keep your jimmies stable.

Anything else was honey-sweetened..another of her severe allergies.  Her GF shop got this in and she is in love, this is as close to the childhood favorites as she has seen in years! I'm now hooked on it too, as a snack right from the box!

review/text: I made the popcorn with the butter and the mix. I avoid using butter on all foods for the pure fat content. I thought the butter packet was actually some type of caramel or sweet flavoring - but it was just butter. I used less than 1/2 of the butter packet after realizing it was not a flavoring and chucked the rest int he trash. The other packet tasted like seaweed and rice snacks. I tried it, won't try it again. Not impressed with the flavor, calories, or the snack in general.

review/summary: Putting the ginger back in ginger ale!
review/text: I know, I know. These reviews are nothing but memories, but I can't help it! If I can drink a tasty drink that is good for me, gives me energy, and makes me think of happy things, well, why wouldn't I? This one is all my grandmother and my father. Every Thanksgiving, my grandmother would let us drink cranberry juice mixed with ginger ale, and we felt so grown up. So grown up! It's still my preferred way of drinking cranberry juice, and when the cranberry ginger ale is released around the holidays, all I do is think of her. Her son, my father, is a ginger ale memory for me too, it's his favorite soft drink. Vernor's, if you've got it, or Schweppes, but Canada Dry will do in a pinch and make him think of me anyway. When my wife is ill, it's ginger ale, if you please, not lemon-lime anything. You know that old adage that girls always search for someone like their father? It's so true in my case...my wife and my father are amazingly alike. So when I spotted it on the Red Leaf tea website, I had to grab it for my campaign to get her to like ginger ale. Who knows, I might convert my dad with it when he comes up to visit next!<br /><br />This is wonderful. Ginger and I are not the best of buddies, but I'm coming around to it. This reminds me of a local ginger ale found only in Middle Kentucky called "Ale-8-1". It's full of ginger flavor, but in a very good way. If you get this one, don't be put off by the overwhelming ginger smell, it's not nearly as strong as it smells, which is a good thing to me. It would definitely be a matcha I reach for when I'm headed into work with an upset stomach, but need a pick me up. I don't think it's one I'll keep in stock, but it's not one I'll be actively trying to swap away either. I'm excited to try it with the cranberry. If you're familiar with ginger ale brands, it's more of a Vernor's than anything else. Lord have mercy, I spend way too much time with ginger ale, apparently. But if I can talk my Dad into trying matcha, this will definitely be the one I lead with. Who knows, my father in law greatly enjoyed the French Vanilla matcha from Red Leaf Tea, maybe my dad can be won over as well!

review/summary: Less flavor impact than liquid
review/text: I had previously used faerie's finest liquid raspberry flavoring with good results.  As many of my recipes require a low amt of liquid, I opted to change to a powder.  The powder is much less flavorful than the liquid.  The smell is not obvious (expected for powder).  However, this same effect carries over into the product.  The powder and liquid measurements are supposed to be equivalent.  However, putting in 1/2 tsp of powder resulted in minimal scent and taste.  I ended up using twice as much powder as liquid to get an equivalent effect.  The powder is a much weaker flavoring product than the liquid.  The taste is OK but does taste a bit more chemically than the liquid.

review/summary: Splinters anyone?
review/text: I have a couple of dogs, one of which, loves to chew on bones. I gave it to my dog as a Christmas treat and it went to town. But later I found little splinters on the floor. It did not register to me at first since it had lost the meat flavoring color and it was pure white. Still being oblivious at the time, I tried to give the same dog another one, seeing how he loved the first one, and he just walked the other way. Then after my dog threw up, the bone splinter riddle was solved.<br />Later, my daughter, who works at a dog adoption organization, told me that I should have never given my dog pork bones... at least not the dried out variety. Perhaps this won't be a problem for your dog but my dog can really chew thru bone... so maybe that was it. In any case, lesson learned for me with my dogs. And perhaps a heads up for you and your dog if you have any concerns.

They have a liability statement on their product because I am sure I am not the first dog owner to have gone through the hell that I went through. I bought a smoked bone from the grocery store because I thought it was big looking, met the size required for my dog and I thought since it was American made it was a quality product. It is far less than quality. Would anyone give arsenic to their dog, absolutely not. So don't spend your money on this killer product. After 3,500 dollars in gastronomy surgery, emergency care,I spent a sad and scared Christmas tending to a poor puppy whining and whelping in pain from their defective junk. Please take this review to heart, I want to spare you what I went through.

We bought the first one at Petco, Petco brand, and she loved it and eventually broke it in two (prob a month or so after having it), and she was needing a new one.  I decided to go with this one on Amazon and she LOVED it!! She spent an entire hour chewing on this just during the first sitting.  She carries it around the house with her and it is FANTASTIC because she doesn't try to chew the wall anymore (or carpet! augh!!).  Highly recommend. :)  Thanks, Amazon.

She is now on 3 medications and a special diet for the next week.  The vet advised me to contact Hartz to let them know what happened.  I plan on doing that AND sending a copy of the bill.  I don't expect them to pay it (they'll likely file it in the circular file) but they need see it and hear about it. I purchased these Hartz "Premium" bones for "aggressive chewers" from Walmart so did not have the advantage of the WARNING reviews on Amazon. You do.  Don't do this to your dog.

I didn't think anything about it until 2 hours later when after a walk, my dog regurgitated twice! I checked the vomit and sure enough, there was shards of the bone inside. This stuff was so sharp it actually cut my latex glove! BE CAREFUL. If it could cut my glove, it can damage a dog's stomach, colon, intestines and/or esophogus. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET AND NOT SOLD! There is a disclaimer on the product packaging, "This is a natural product and may be prone to splintering." Are you kidding me!? I have been monitoring my dog, whom regurgitated two more times since. Still not sure if I need to go to the vet yet. Gave her 1/3 can of pumpkin to coat her stomach and 3-slices of white bread, which I read will gum up and help her pass any shards in her stomach. Why any company would sell such a product is beyond me. This american made item, lacks the quality to sell in america. I am appalled it is even being sold on the shelves. STAY AWAY. Read the other negative reviews. $3500 for stomach surgery and chances of fatalities. Is it worth it to risk the life of a loved family member over a $3.00 bone! Absolutely not. DO NOT PURCHASE, IT IS UNSAFE.

review/summary: Not worth it!
review/text: I bought this product today hoping to amuse my chew-loving dog. But after unwrapping the packaging, I was disappointed. Not only did the bone have a weird, unnatural oil all over it but it also smelled like chemicals. I offered it to my dog, who after being so excited at the sight of the bone, smelled it and walked away! I tried to wash off all the meat and other particles outside but even the inside smelled like chemicals and my dog was not buying it!

review/summary: My Lab just ate the whole thing!
review/text: OMG, I gave this to my 1 year old, 110 lab and he ran outside with it. I got distracted and when I went to check he had already eaten the entire thing. The only thing I could find were two horrible splinter pieces!! Now I'm at this moment terrified!!! I read the other reviews where some dogs have had to have surgery because of these...I'm hoping and praying my dog will be okay. It's only been a hour since it happened and now all we can do is wait and watch. I've given him some bread and he gets pumkin every night anyway. Plus he had already eaten his dinner so I'm hoping his "full" tummy will help the bone to pass. Needless to say my husband is mad at me for not showing it to him before I handed it out. But we've been going through some major life issues the last couple of weeks and I'm not thinking clearly as it is. I soooo wish I could turn back time and have never given it to him!! Please stay away from this bone and please, if you are reading this and have any good thoughts to help while I wait, I'm open to them as I am worried sick!!! I've already lost my 14 year old lab in Sept and this one we got in Oct and he his my Angel!!! I would die if anything happened to him!!!

review/summary: Nice Caramels
review/text: I ordered these triple treat caramels as part of an upcoming anniversary present for my parents and as small gifts to my co-workers. One of my co-workers is named Judy and she's diabetic and likes candies and sweets, so I thought of her after reading the name of the company and that these candies are low carb, sugar free, and diabetic-friendly. The caramel candies are packaged nicely, and according to my co-workers, the candies taste great. I can't chew candies because of TMJ and jaw problems - so I took my co-workers' words and comments that the caramels are subtle-tasting, soft, and guilt-free. So, it's great that Amazon offers Judy's Candy Triple Treat Caramels. Before my TMJ problems got worse in the past few years, I was able to chew on soft caramel candies, and the best-tasting caramels I've ever had was Good Karmal. I introduced myself to Good Karmal in the year 2002 after I read a magazine article that the cast members of "Felicity" (one of my favorite television shows from my Graduate School years), particularly Keri Russell, liked these caramels, and the fact these caramels had fortune cookie-like messages. I thought to myself that Good Karmal had a great concept! Even Oprah Winfrey likes Good Karmal. Anyways, besides Judy's Candy Caramels, I highly recommend Good Karmal. I can't eat caramel candy now, but in my entire lifetime, Good Karmal caramels left a long lasting impression on me as being the best caramel candy I've ever had besides Rolos. And Good Karmal caramels arrive wrapped in fortune cookie-like messages with positive quotes of wisdom. Ever since I was a little girl, I've loved fortune cookie messages and I have a small box full of fortune cookie messages I've kept over the years. My current co-workers love taping fortune cookie messages on their computer monitors. Even though I can't eat fortune cookies now, the people who know me - my parents, relatives, co-workers, and friends - automatically, over the past several years and now, give fortune cookies for me to open each time they go to a restaurant that offers them. Anyways, Good Karmal offers a variety of caramel flavors and they come packaged in excellent Asian-like containers that you can use long after the caramels are gone. Good Karmal candies make excellent gifts. Each person I gave these as gifts to since 2002 have told me that they loved Good Karmal and thanked me for introducing them to the brand, and a bonus is that part of the profits from Good Karmal go to environmental charities. So, if you want the best caramels, try this Judy's Candy Triple Treat Caramels and also visit Good Karmal's website. If Amazon started selling Good Karmal candy, that would be excellent as well. You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Very peachy &lt;3
review/text: Having never tried Oolong (Wulong) tea before I blindly purchased this particular one with the most reviews. There really aren't many green teas on Amazon that have more than 2 reviews if that.<br /><br />Anyways, I tried this first and it was very tasty and had a very distinct peach flavour. The day after I received it and sampled it I went to my local farmer's market (not like a Harry's this one is a local and very decently priced organic farmer's market) and I purchased some plain Oolong. I looked up information on how to tell if the Oolong that you have is good quality and comparing the 2 they both came out to be good quality. The Oolong I bought at the farmer's market was excellent quality actually (by the guides I'd found on google) but this Peach Oolong is still pretty good quality. The only thing it didn't do to deem it excellent is unfold. The dried leave/roasted leaves are supposed to gain some of their (green) colour back after being steeped, and unfold (i.e. look like full leaves). But aside from that this Peach Oolong matched every standard I found for good quality Oolong.<br /><br />Also, for any potential buyers. One uses 1 tablespoon of oolong to brew a 8oz cup of tea and that one tablespoon can be used 5 times in total without losing strength or flavour. Just make sure to keep the leaves covered in water (leave some tea in your cup, just enough to cover the leaves). They need to be kept moist in order to keep their strength and not dry out. I tended to leave a bit in the bottom of a cup with the leaves or leave a tea ball with the leaves in another cup of water (it doesn't steep and brew more, it just keeps it moist :)...I used cold water but I don't know if temperature of storage water matters). I hope this helps and I hope you guys enjoy the tea. It's tasty. I'm enjoying it at my office right now :-D.

I believe the only way to come close to enjoying the cheese part of this is to store the box, in its entirety, in a humid environment so the cheese can, well, get soft. Other than that, it's horrible and you should simply discard it. The Slim Jim, on the other hand, is "so-so" but may taste better with a dip or something. This is not the same as the skinny Slim Jims (you know, the addictive ones) so if you don't want to ruin your taste buds with so-so beef and horrible cheese, move on.

review/summary: Awesome, high quality food
review/text: After reading a lot of reviews on puppy food, I settled on Nature's Variety Prairie puppy food.  It has high quality ingredients, no by-products, and lots of vitamins and minerals for my little guy to develop into a healthy adult.  The food has made my dog's coat super lustrous; he's an almost 5 month old Pembroke Welsh Corgi.  Since switching to this brand (we were using Authority puppy food before), his coat has become super shiny and soft.  He loves the taste and it makes his poops relatively small and hard.  If switching to this brand, be sure to switch slowly by integrating larger and larger amounts of this food while decreasing amounts of the original food.  I highly recommend this product, and the price is cheaper on Amazon than at Petco!

I use to buy it at the store,if I could find it, but was paying about $4.00 a loaf.  Buying it in quantity on-line saves a lot of money. It stores well in the refrigerator or freezer. Handle carefully to avoid breaking the loafs. There are a number of different kinds.  Some have wheat, so read the labels, if you are avoiding wheat.

review/summary: Vegan dish served in Buddhist monasteries
review/text: The food label Companion sells a line of vegan foods made of wheat gluten and tofu, many with vegetables like mushrooms, carrots, string beans, bamboo shoots, baby corns etc., seasoned with soy and/or chili sauce.  The company is based in Taiwan.  It is said that these foods are dishes served in Buddhist monasteries in China.  This Vegetarian Sausage With Chop Suey Morsels is one of these Companion foods.  It is made of wheat gluten, straw mushrooms, and bamboo shoots in soy sauce.  It is delicious over steamed rice.  It adds variety to a vegan diet.  See my comment below for other buying options.
