review/summary: Awesome food!
review/text: Blue Buffalo is nothing to look down on, however, it just wasn't the right fit for my lil' guy. I have a 9 month old standard schnauzer(very active) This is the first wholesome food that didn't give him massive gas! We tried several different dog food brands and types within brands, this is by far the best. He is very regular and not at all unpleasant and he eats it right up. This is the best, well rounded food for my pup.

review/text: Love this stuff! The price is a killer though... Much better to buy it here than in the grocery store (price wise). My dog's coat it beautiful, urinary tract issues MUCH improved, and the taste is apparently delish! (Tail wag and chop lickingi when the scoop dives into the open bag). These quality ingredients are worth the money. Due to quality ingredients, your dog doesn't have to eat as much to be full and healthy!

review/summary: Halo A+  Vendor F-
review/text: I love the brand food Halo & have always order from amazon because I would get it under the prime option w/no shipping charges.  But the last order I placed through amazon but they passed it on to another vendor & they kept pushing my delivery date out further & further to the point of me having to cancel the order & place another on the Halo site (luckly they had a promo of free shipping) so beware when you place the order if amazon is not shipping it themselves. But my dogs love the food & I find myself having to feed them 1/2 of what the some other brands say to use...  So far I've bought all 3 flavors & they really don't care which one I serve, I just like to switch things up every now & then.

review/summary: Tasty and easy side dish
review/text: I'm always looking for gluten-free side dishes that are easy to prepare.  Most of the rice mixes on the market have gluten and are therefore off my list!  I generally cook up a large batch of brown rice ahead of time, freeze it in quart bags, and then thaw and season it when needed.  However, it isn't always convenient to cook up the rice and I needed something that would be ready and waiting in my pantry and cook up quickly.  This rice fits the bill!  We both liked the way it was seasoned and it cooked up pretty quick on the stove top.  If I had one complaint, it is that the package I cooked last weekend (my first) contained maybe three peas...I added a cup of my own frozen peas to "fill in."  Otherwise, it was really very good and it is something I will keep around as a convenient addition to gluten-free meals!

I cooked the product exactly per the box instructions, and it was over-salted and over-seasoned.  Many better and more economical products on the market, such as those from Goya

review/summary: Where's the spice?
review/text: Imagine my suprise when I went to prepare the product (1st time buyer) and there was no spice packette?!  So I needed to open all the remainng to check if theirs were missing. Found another! Even so I would recommend this product.  It's not "quick" but the rice turns out fluffy and flavorful. By no means is it spicy. Intend to add my own on the occasion that I would like a little more heat.  As for the boxes sans the spice mixture...I used them in a fresh tomato soup I had made...yummy. Next time will include the spices - it was that good. When the weather warms I'm thinking to transform it into a cold rice salad. So I would definately recommend this product...if you need to be gluten free or not.

review/summary: If you can only get canned chiles . . .
review/text: Obviously, the preference for roasted green New Mexico chiles is (1) fresh; (2) frozen; (3) canned, but if you need to use canned chiles because of availability or price (it costs around $50 to send 20 lbs of frozen chiles overnight from New Mexico), then these are a great alternative. With the possible exception of Ortega "Fire Roasted" chiles (which I can only find in much smaller cans), these are the most flavorful and consistent canned chiles I've found, and the "heat" on the label is pretty accurate. They keep well and I've used them to make very good salsas, quesos, and other Mexican dishes.<br /><br />Green chiles in general are very healthy in your diet, and I have never had a problem with an "off" flavor in the Hatch brand. My theory is any green chiles are better than no green chiles, and this is a very dependable, high quality brand.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

review/text: I have had Hatch green chilies that I have roasted myself and also the green chili sauce Hatch puts out under the Stokes label. The Stokes is definitely good. My on recipes with fresh roasted chilies are exceptional because of the freshness. The acidity in the canned chilies makes them taste like vinegar with no heat. Don't bother - buy fresh and roast your own. They freeze well. They come into season annually in middle August - absoulutely the only way to go.

review/summary: excellent product
review/text: This is an excellent product especially for anyone trying to avoid dairy.  It has many health benefits, high in calcium, and an excellent source of mcfa's -, (medium chain fatty acids) which are used by the body for energy and not stored as fat.  It is a natural way to get calcium rather than supplements which are questionable in their ability to absorb and be used by the body.  Other than these health benefits, it is what it says - so delicious.  The previous reviewer that complained it didn't taste like coconut - I must say I don't think you would want the coconut taste if using this milk in your cereal, the coconut taste could be overpowering.  I think the company did an excellent job of keeping the taste fairly neutral so that it is not offensive when added to shakes or cereal. My niece can't have dairy but is able to enjoy this so it was a lifesaver for her.  I can't say enough good about this excellent product.  Also referring the the negative reviewer who had the spill, that is unfortunate but a one in a million episode.  I've been buying this product for a long time and never had a problem with the packaging.  It's a personal thing as far as liking it or not - all I can say is give it a try and decide for yourself.

review/summary: Overall a decent product, just avoid buying these "Bargain Hunters"
review/text: I was happy to find out that Pom Wonderful has already shelled pistachios. Like the unshelled version these are salty (160mg of sodium per serving of 1/4 cup), but I tend to eat them as a snack with some fruit & water to balance it out. On occasion I have found a few nuts that taste a little "too" roasted. But nothing that would prevent me from purchasing this brand again, as long as the price is decent.<br /><br />The only thing I would warn about is to be mindful of who you are purchasing this product from. The last time I got these pistachios was from the Amazon seller "BargainHunters" and it came with a hole in the packaging (large enough for an insect or lizard to crawl into). Tried contacting them about it but they ignored me. That was disappointing because overall their seller feedback is pretty decent (over 90% positive). But looking at their negative comments it seems as if any of their customers have a issue, then they will be ignored so I know I'm not the only one who's had an issue with their lack of customer service.

review/text: I have a $400 Briel Espresso machine and have tried Caffe D'arte, Espresione, Illy, Starbucks, Espresso Pod Sampler, and the Kona Espresso Pods.  The Caffe D'arte in my opinion are best in value and taste when it comes to everyday espresso.  I typically drink two to three cups a day.  They are the cheapest per pod, of the ones I tried, with consistant taste and crema.  However, for ultimate home espresso or if budget is not a concern I would recommend the Kona Espresso Pods.  They are the most expensive per pod but in my opinion, the best by far.  All pods mentioned however, are very good and vary in price.<br /><br />All pods mentioned are E.S.E. pods (easy serving espresso). Ensure that your machine is an E.S.E. pod system for these to work.  There are some espresso machines that have their own pod size system.

I have a very inexpensive Hamilton Beach espresso/cappucino maker so I have never considered buying any high priced espresso to run through it.  I have lived off of the Illy pads as my source for consistent cappucinos but decided to give these a try based on the price.<br /><br />I have found these pods to be no different from the Illy pods when using my machine.  The espresso comes out the same color and with virtually the same crema on it with every pod I've used.  The taste is a bit lighter than the standard Illy pods I've used but, for me, it is a pleasant light taste.  If you like a strong espresso flavor, this is not the pod for you.<br /><br />I am very good at distinguishing various single estate coffees but have never been good at telling the different between a cappucino made by Starbucks, small coffee shop, at home or Dunking Donu.....OK maybe not Dunkin Donuts!  I think that part of the reason is that I do not drink straight espresso.  I would probably notice a difference between these pods and, say..an expensive espresso bean that is feshly roasted and ground.  However, with all the steamed milk that goes into a cappucino, it reducues the coffe down so much that it is just hard to tell the difference.<br /><br />For the casual drinker like myself, I don't think you can go wrong with these pods.  If you are a "snob" like I am with my regular coffee, and drink straight espresso, you should probably look elsewhere.

review/summary: Decent Pods
review/text: The prior box of pods I got featured a variety of southern Italian pods.  I loved these at first because of the intense flavor.  I decided the next order would be for pods similar to what I'd find in Seattle.  This box fit the bill nicely.  These pods are delicious and provided a nice change.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Good taste, very slow pour
review/text: These pods are slightly more bitter than Lavazza pods, but they taste very good for a pod espresso packet.  My main complaint is that they take a long time to pour a double shot out of my espresso machine.  Significantly longer than the Lavazza pods, and an even greater difference than tamped grounds.

review/summary: Tastes fine... but renders my machine's auto-stop feature useless.
review/text: I wish there were 1/2 stars - I'd probably do 2 1/2 stars instead.<br /><br />I have a Francis! Francis! and these pods render the mechanism that auto-stops the machine useless. It will just spill over and keep running. To me, a product that negates such a useful feature on my machine needs to be brought back to the lab for more work. I don't know if it's the porportion of grinds, or the height of the pod - but I would like this product a whole lot more if it allowed the machine to work as it should. Function of the pods would get 1 star.<br /><br />The illy and Starbucks ESE pods work perfectly with the machine and stop at the appropriate time -with perfect doses of espresso.<br /><br />That said, this coffee has a nice taste, decent crema and is otherwise enjoyable. Taste would get 4 stars.<br /><br />Just be prepared to babysit your machine very carefully or you will have a huge mess.

review/summary: Nice Espresso.
review/text: I really enjoy these espresso pods.  I previously was using the Lavazza pods in my Starbucks Espresso machine. These seem to brew a bit slower and the espresso is a bit darker. The flavor is deeper and more full than most of the others I have tried.  The Lavazza pods do seem to have more crema when brewed in my machine.  I also noticed that the first shot pulled (after priming) has less crema than the second shot.  This of course may have nothing to do with the Espresso itself and could be particular to my machine.  Anyhow, I think most people would enjoy these, and the price really can't be beat.

review/summary: Reasonable price for a reasonably good espresso
review/text: I like to think of myself as someone who knows espresso. For several years I studied coffee, tea and in particular espresso's and methods of roasting, grinding and extracting. But I'm also a little bit of a miser - I don't want to spend too much on coffee. Hey! it's a past time, not a passion - at least for me. So, with all that giberish out of the way, What do I think of Caffe D'arte? Ummm, more giberish... First and foremost, you have to have the right kind of espresso machine - pump driven. If you don't then it's pretty unlikely the espresso you use is going to make a difference. Second, you need good water. Recently someone suggested using distilled water mixed with one bottle of San Peligrino in the water tank of my machine (a Solis Crema SL70) - he said this would produce the "most exceptional cup of espresso." Eh! I don't know - I never tried it. Anyway, third, even with espresso pods (cialde) you have to know what you're doing. It's never going to be like fresh roasted, precision ground, hand packed epresso - no, never! Doing it by hand is an art that's mastered after much time and effort. Let's face it - if your buying espresso pods you're doing it for the convenience, not for the experience. Okay, okay - I know, I'm running on. Let's get to the point - why you're here. I have used Danese, Illy, Lavazza, Mauro, one I can't remember the name and now Caffe D'arte. To be truthful, some didn't work well in my machine - Danese and Illy in particular. Of the one's that did - Mauro and the forgotten one.... drum roll.... I like Caffe D'arte the best. I found the others to be too bitter or too strong and in the case of Lavazza, too weak. Some produced a weak crema or lacked enough espresso taste.<br />Aha! There you are! The smart ones who just skipped to the bottom - Here's what you're looking for - I like Caffe D'arte - it's a decent (and convenient) espresso. Acceptable crema, medium taste and reasonable price.

review/summary: Terrible taste, horrific price!  Lavazza Gran Crema is much better!
review/text: Illy coffee has always been my favorite.  But since the price went up from $23 for a twin pack to $32 in 2011, I started to look for cheaper alternatives.  I ordered the Lavazza Gran Crema Espresso, 2.2-pounds Box (Pack of 150) and I really love it! The freshly brewed creme is really nice and foamy!!Yum! After finishing the whole box in less than 2 month, I wanted to try something different.  Caffe d'arte firenze to me is very potent and astringent and almost too earthy (in other words, it tastes like dirt). Price is higher than Lavazza Grand Crema i.e. $0.35 a pop compared to $0.24 for Lavazza if you subscribed it. Even worse, this is a "non-refundable product" so I have to stick with it for a while :(

review/text: I don't like to return the items in general.  because I usually spend some time researching and reading to make sure the product that I order is up to my expectation. This light coffee didn't make coffee at all. I used the pod in my commercial Cuisinart one cup coffee maker and it gives me too light cup of coffee, one that you can see the bottom of the cup. Besides, these are not returnable nor exchangeable. I've never been so disappointed with Amazon.com product that I decided to comment on this product.

Then they came out with this "Perfect Pinch" Lemon and Herb. It tastes nothing the same. In fact I can not even taste the lemon at all and the other "herbs" have zero flavor in my opinion. Bring back the old seasoning. I just ordered the origional flavoring without the "perfect Pinch" on Amazon. Don"t waste your $$$ on the "perfect Pinch" Lemon and Herb.

review/text: It arrived in perfect condition and the trunk has been beautifully training into an "S" shape without any trunk scarring.  The little fukien leaves were nice and shiny and it had the little white flower bloom.  A very beautiful tree it is.<br /><br />For Brussel's website, I would recommend to them that they upgrade their ordering system as it is not a secured server (128 bit SSL with little padlock icon).  I was going to order from them directly as it is only $39.99 compared to $49.99 FOR THE EXACT SAME TREE (not taking into consideration the shipping costs) but I would rather pay more and order through AMAZON'S secure server, so I did.

review/text: Brussels does a very good job of packaging and shipping their trees.  It came in perfect condition.  This is my very first bonsai tree and I almost lost it due to a lack of watering.  You must keep this tree watered or it will drop all of it leaves.  These trees are very hardy and are capable of recovering from mistakes like these as long as the mistake is not too prolonged.  The fukien tea is an awesome indoor tree, but you must take care of it!

review/summary: Many issues to contend with
review/text: I also received the wrong tree the first time.  The first tree came quickly but was also the Gardenia tree.  After contacting Amazon they reshipped the correct tree.  It came quickly and was packed properly.  Upon arrival the tree looked good, but it quickly changed.  I have, in the past, grown Bonsai trees with success.  They do require attention and proper watering as well as light and growing conditions.  Both trees came in ceramic pots that did not match the description.  They were different colors and different from the photos on the site.  The gardenia tree did loose most of its leaves, but had new growth somewhat quickly afterwards.  This review is about the tree that I ordered.  This Fukien Tea Tree started to loose all of its leaves and appeared to be in distress.  I kept it watered, gave it great morning and afternoon light and maintained the temp around 75 degrees.  After several weeks, the tree has lost almost all of its green growth.  I had an expert view the tree and this gentleman seemed to think that the soil that the tree was planted in was too dense and didn't allow for any oxygen to reach the roots.  He seemed to think that the Gardenia tree was ok, but not the Fukien Tea tree.  He didn't think that transplanting the tree this soon after receipt would help since these trees need time to adjust to their new surroundings.  Also mentioned in the directions that came with both trees.  He also noticed some fertilizer beads in the soil which to him might also might not be the "ideal" for the tree.  He recommends a water based food mixed in with the water a given to the tree weekly.<br /><br />I wonder if all of these "conditions" were done to the tree since they had to send it to me to correct their "first" error of the wrong tree.<br /><br />Even though I love Amazon, I would recommend to anyone considering purchasing a Bonsai tree to select one from a local source.  These local Bonsai retailers are more interested in helping you get a perfect tree and have more a vested interest in your success than Brussel's does.<br /><br />Not that $50 is that much more than a good bunch of flowers from a florist, you still expect your tree to live for years.

review/summary: Great Gift
review/text: I originally bought this bonsai tree as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.  The shipping was great and the tree arrived very nicely secured in a box with wet soil and everything was great.  However, I'm not sure if it was the shock from the cold weather or the shipping or what, but the tree was dead upon arrival.  I then contacted the Amazon customer service and they got back to me right away.  They fixed the problem by sending me another tree which arrived quickly and was beautiful.  I then re-potted the plant as I felt that the pot was too small for it for the home, but a great way for the nursery to maintain all of the trees that it has and it is now flourishing.  So my advice is that if you feel that your tree isn't faring well, re-pot it so that the roots can spread out and grow.  I never let the soil get dry and my tree is doing great!  I personally feel that due to the fact that all bonsai trees are so finicky, that the shipping kind of shocks the plant, but the trees from this nursery are great!  I will definitely be ordering from them again!

Just water every 2-3 days and keep in a sunny place.<br /><br />Also, I need to comment on the packaging for this tree. The pot was shrinkwrapped to prevent soil spillage, and the tree was kept in place by another piece of cardboard. There was no way that thing was going to topple over during transit.

review/summary: Awesome Bonsai
review/text: I was so shocked by how beautiful this tree is.  It has several blooms, is taller and has a thicker trunk than I expected.  It looks to be a very established bonsai tree.  I am a little concerned about it being an indoor tree with all the beautiful blooms so I will watch it close to make sure it will continue to bloom inside.  I got it for my office and we have open blinds and fluorescent lights so I am hoping that will be enough light for it to survive.  The packing was superb a very professional job.  My only suggestion to Brussel's is to sell humidity trays for their inside bonsai trees.  It is impossible to ever find matching ceramic humidity trays for bonsai pots.  And when you keep bonsai trees inside they really require a humidity tray, not only to catch the water overflow but the trees need extra humidity when keeping them in air condition/heated buildings.  I strongly suggest this tree even if I end up having to bring it home for my patio.  I have received so many compliments from my co-workers.  It is worth every penny.  I am very pleased with my purchase.

review/text: Tree arrived shrink-wrapped and strapped to the bottom of a large box filled with packing (very impressive packing).  The tree was healthy and the soil was still moist, if anything it had too much soil.  I took a fork and scooped out a good bit of soil so as not to have a huge mound around the trunk of the tree.<br /><br />The picture shows a blue tray, but mine was brown, but for me that worked better with my office's color scheme.  I added some baby tears to the soil as a ground cover and to keep the soil wetter.<br /><br />I didn't notice any leaves dropping like others have reported, in fact it's putting out little white flowers that are great.  Don't believe the reviews that are two years old, maybe the trees were poor quality back then but the one I got is great.

review/text: I ordered from an Amazon seller to get the best price and customer service, and I'm glad I did. The first tree that arrived was practically dead. The soil was nearly frozen and the leaves so dark they were almost black. Amazon promptly handled the exchange, so I got a healthy tree in time for Christmas. The pot (each time) was a less-attractive brownish oval shape, so keep that in mind when buying a humidity tray to coordinate. The Fukien is a beautiful tree - it doesn't look like what people expect when you say "bonsai," but I prefer the waxy leaves to the evergreen-style juniper trees.

Since then it has lost some leaves, quite a few actually since I have had to leave it indoors due to the climate I live in. HOWEVER......I have also purchased a simple single bulb Agro Gro-Lite and now the tree is coming back with all kinds of little leaves and flowers coming in. There are still alot of original leaves  though. I  put the tree in a humidity tray as well.

review/summary: Great tree, a little rocky at the start
review/text: When my fukien tree arrived, it was green for about a week and lost all of its leaves. I kept watering it and keeping it in ideal conditions but the branches remained bare. I almost gave up and tossed it out but I held on and a month after the last leave fell off it exploded in new growth. Now the tree is gorgeous and my favorite of the 3 different bonsai I maintain. My theory is that the problem was half 'shock' to the plant from the shipping process, and half me initially overwatering it when I noticed the leaves drying. That being said, when your leaves fall off, continue to care for the tree and be patient. I think you should expect the tree to react in some way (dropping leaves) to the shipping it has gone through. Also expect that if you continue to properly care for the tree that it will come back and be exactly what the nursery has offered you. Not claiming to be an expert however, so I could be wrong. The chinese elm I have didnt lose any leaves when it arrived so who knows.

review/text: Well I got this tree a few weeks ago and the leaves started to turn yellow as is normal. The tree has only been kept inside with NO other plants and under a full spectrum light. It now has aphids and a fungus and unfortunately isn't looking too well.<br /><br />Update: The plant is still alive a few months later. It was a constant battle with the aphids until I finally put the bonsai tree outdoors and a swarm of lady bugs devoured all of them haha. The one issue I'm still having is that I can not get this thing to produce the berries its supposed to. About a dozen or so flower will bud and then die after blooming.<br /><br />As a tip to other buyers, remove the moss on top of the soil IMMEDIATELY and water it every day. The soil should be damp all the time. If your leaves are drooping or turning yellow, it needs more water.

review/summary: Fabulous little tree
review/text: I have been looking into getting a bonsai tree and was a little scared of getting a tree online but my husband talked me into it. SO....the tree arrived and I was so excited to take a look at it. First let me just say that the tree was shipped and packaged wonderfully. The soil was still very moist and no lost soil or leaves. The picture that they have shown is pretty close to the tree that I recieved. The only difference is the color of the pot, which I actually like the color of the pot better. If you are wondering if you should buy one of these trees I have to say my experience with this company has been fabulous and so was the little tree.

review/summary: Excellent condition, very prompt shipping
review/text: I bought the Fukien Tea Bonsai as a birthday gift for my mother, who has expressed interest in the plants before. It arrived in one day and was packaged so well it took me more than ten minutes to extract it from it's cardboard confines. the leaves are vibrant green with small spots which i hope are normal. it was nice and moist on opening, so I know it was well watered. I will edit this review if it rapidly dies, but otherwise it is perfect.

review/summary: Mother's Day gift dead by Father's Day
review/text: Save your money or spend a few dollars more & visit a local nursery or at least shop around more & read customer reviews. I bought this as a gift for Mother's Day. It arrived in a timely manner & in good condition or what appeared to be healthy to a layman. She followed guidelines for watering, light, etc. But as the few short weeks wore on, the leaves fell off & the plant was dead by Father's Day (a month later). Unable to return or get refund/credit because the recipient lives quite a distance away. She didn't inform me of the plant's passing until after the time period for returns has just expired. I should have read the customer reviews first - lesson learned... the hard way!

review/summary: Arrived as described, but poorly trained.
review/text: Regarding the Seller - The tree was packed very well, and arrived according to the description.  There were a few dead leaves, but I expected this.  The seller gets 5 stars.<br /><br />Regarding the Tree - I have several complaints about the tree.  First, whoever was trimming the branches did an extremely poor job.  The trunk was filled with "knobs" from branches that were cut off.  This happens when straight scissors are used to cut the branches rather than the appropriate concave branch trimmers.  I'm no expert at growing bonsai, but even I know this very basic principle.  I would expect the person who grew and trained this bonsai to understand it too.<br />Second, the tree was very very lopsided, almost to the point that it would tip over at the slightest bump.  This will be easy to fix when I re-pot it, but it is still annoying to have to deal with.  On a related note, the pot that it arrived in was very nice.<br /><br />Bottom line, I would recommend getting a bonsai at a local store rather than online.  The picture of the bonsai in the listing is like the picture of a Big-mac on the menu... that is, the big-mac you get doesn't compare to the picture, even though it contains all the ingredients.

review/summary: Definitely a solid bonsai tree with few extra purchases
review/text: The tree came quickly and in a very safe, peanut filled packing to protect the tree from shock.  The tree came pre potted in a classy ceramic; however, it did not come with a drip tray under the assumption that you might be a professional outdoor bonsai gardener and just place it on wooden slats, etc.  The tree is well worth the low price, and I have yet to see any pests.  I ha a scare when I first got it, because the leaves turned yellow in some places and fell off.  After doing some research on this plant, I found out this was normal for trees being shipped and placed in new environments.  The tree requires very little water in my dry, hot home environment (indoors), and I daily spray the leaves and base with water.  However, I did need to purchase an indoor UV light (50W) to provide proper lighting.  A window that is not south facing will not be sufficient.  Also, the blossoms in spring time are very refreshing in the house.  Highly suggested even for the most novice of growers.

review/summary: Maybe in the Spring?
review/text: The first tree looked good, but arrived with a broken pot.  I returned it without problem for a replacement.<br /><br />The leaves of the second tree were dark and drooping.  The soil was very wet.  The leaves quickly began to dry and fall from the tree.  I suspect there was some cold damage during shipment (6 days by UPS) or the soil was just too wet.  Since I've read that the Fukien Tea may loose it's leaves, I've kept the soil moist and have been waiting for it to releaf. The small branches have become brittle, so there's not much hope.  The return window is open for another two weeks.  Should the tree perk up by then, I'll provide an update.<br /><br />It would have been a nice looking tee.  I don't recommend ordering in winter.

review/text: Packed perfectly in a nice box, but UPS sat it outside the door, boxed up in the hot, humid heat all day and left it there.  IF I would have received or UPS left it at the office where I live, it may be alive today.  WATER UPON RECEIPT or next day.  The bonsai looked similar to the one in the photo but with some brown leaves that got progressively worse daily.  I didn't know then that it desperately needed water ASAP so it died.  Now I believe if I would have known it needed water and soaked in 1-3" of water in a sink or tub right away, that it may be alive today.  I received reimbursement & would like to order another now.

review/text: I recieved this little tree in the mail with quite a few brown and dying leaves.  The flowers soon died off as well.  The tree does have good form though, so we'll have to see if it actually survives.<br /><br />It's dead now!!! It looks like it didn't make it... I returned it to Amazon and they gave me a refund. Soil did not allow water to enter even after a complete soaking. So I packed the twig back into the box and the UPS guy came and took it away for free. Now I have to clean the hundreds of dead leaves off of my floor.

It immediately lost nearly all its leaves, which I've read is typical when relocated, but never recovered and finally died several months later, despite following the instructions.<br /><br />I don't recommend this tree, especially since it was recently selling for nearly twice what we paid around the holidays.

review/text: I would have loved this Bonsai. It came very dried out, and VERY sticky. I got it pretty revived by setting it in water for a couple hrs each day for the next couple weeks. But continued to be very sticky. Could not see anything on it until I had it long enough to discovered it was infested with bugs. One big sticky mess....I have too many other plants to worry about an outbreak so I threw it out. Won't buy another plant I can not see first. Could have been a beautiful plant.

review/summary: Fukien Tea Bonsai Tree
review/text: My rating is actually a "ZERO" but I had to choose between 1-5.  I will never order from this site again.  I ordered the Fukien Tea tree.  My order was delayed, which is not a big problem and not why I was disappointed.  But when the tree finally arrived - it was the wrong tree, I received the Gardenia tree.  The Fukien has the very tiny little white flowers which produce small red berries.  The Gardenia has larger flowers (which I do not like).  I was not happy that since there was a delay in the shipment of the Fukien tree - someone took it upon themselves to subsitute a different tree.  Did they think I would not know the difference???  If I wanted the Gardenia - I would have ordered it.  This shipment was returned the next day.  Hopefully I will be refunded in a timely manner!!

review/summary: Beautiful little olive bonsai
review/text: June 28, 2006:  Lovely bonsai, extremely well packaged - arrived in perfect condition (beware the oodles of styrofoam pieces left after unpacking! :-))  My olive tree was actually blooming when it arrived last week, and has a nice, delicate fragrance. Pot doesn't come with a saucer, so be sure to put a dish underneath before watering. More compact that the tree pictured (but more typically bonsai shaped), I am quite happy with my purchase. I still prefer to grow, shape and pot my own bonsai, but this little olive (which I can't find in my area other than ordering here) was a nice addition to my bonsai collection. Recommended!<br /><br />Update 1-23-07:<br />Little black olive bonsai still looks fantastic. It has had no health problems, and has bloomed several times since purchased(small, pale green flowers, followed by tiny ornamental fruit that falls off shortly thereafter, like an ornamental crabapple). Needs watering every two-three days in summer, every three-four days in winter. Mine sits in a floor-to-ceiling window in a highrise building receiving full sunlight most of the day, and constant air from an air vent above the window. Hasn't grown much (I experienced one burst of new leaves, which promptly died when I left on vacation and it went without water for almost a week).  So, I haven't needed to trim it yet.  Still recommended!

review/summary: Black Olive Bonsai Tree
review/text: Nice little black olive bonsai with developing nebari  It came wired into its glazed pot in fast-draining soil mix.  Since was early southwest US summer when it arrived, the tree went outside immediately, in a shady spot.  Later on it went into the sun, where is is producing flowers now.  So long as it is watered daily, it's a healthy, slow growing little tree.  Come fall, it will be brought inside with another black olive as these don't like temperatures below 50 degrees.  These trees are so easy to care for and do so well in this climate that I highly recommend them for anybody in the southern part of the USA.  Black olives, black pines and a couple of Chinese elms are the only bonsai I have that thrive in the full blast of mid-New Mexico sun.

review/text: In general, we try to keep sweets out of our household. It's not that we don't like sweets, it's that we do and they can add considerably to the daily calorie count. It's difficult. I can get along without deserts and sweet snacks, but my wife has a longing for them. She's European and considers a small desert to be an essential part of a meal. We both struggle a bit with our weight so go most meals desertless. Now and then something comes along to upset our rigid little format. In this case, our local warehouse store provided a couple-dollars-off coupon on a 54-bar packet of Kellog"s Rice Krispies "krispy marshmellow squares." Well, they're only 90 calories each so what harm could they do? Or so the discussion went. We ended up buying.<br /><br />These things are rather good. They're soft and sweet and provide a certain oral gratification. What the hey? One now and then isn't going to do much harm.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: In consistent quality
review/text: This box was good so I reordered it for a youth event.  The next box was nearly half full of bars that were too hard to bite into.  I guess I will need to make my own from now on.

review/text: So much easier and so much lesssssss messy then making these at home. Just unwrap and place on your tray and serve. No one will know you didn't make them yourself.

review/summary: Eehh
review/text: I havent had these since I was a teen (about 7 years ago), saw them and what I thought I remembered was they were good and I liked them...What was I thinking?  These krispy bars are waayyyy too sweet - I probably still have over half a box left and I bought these weeks ago (in a household of 4 where 3 of us would eat this).  Next time I'll buy the ingredients and make them homemade instead!

review/summary: Connectin works!
review/text: My Newfoundland is 8 years old, has had 2 knee surgeries, & suffers from arthritis.  I have tried dozens of joint supplements over the years.  This is the first one that has clearly made a difference.  He is playing more, walking more freely & generally enjoying life.  I would recommend Connectin to any dog or horse owner whose critters have joint problems.

review/summary: Good product / good price / reliable merchant
review/text: This is a product that I have been using for a year-and-a-half now for my 8 year old/35 pound dog's joint condition.  My veterinarian and I have tried several possible remedies to help a joint condition that resulted from a leg injury, and this is part of the settled regimen that obviously provides relief from pain, increases her joint flexibility, and makes it easier for her to get the exercise she needs (we have her on a special diet, this product, another veterinary over the counter glucosamine supplement, an omega-3 supplement, and a prescription nsaid).  This product is delivered in a 150 tablet plastic container.  Each tablet provides 500mg of glucosamine (derived from shellfish), 250mg of mucopolysaccharides (a bovine source of chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid), and 9 vegetable and herbal supplements that are thought to promote healthy joints (yucca root, nettle leaf, alfalfa extract, devil's claw extract, celery see, black cohosh root, ginger root extract, tumeric extract, and cayenne pepper).  The tablets are chewable and flavored to appeal to canines - i break the pill in half and my dog happily takes each half of the pill from my open palm before her afternoon meal.<br /><br />This merchant provided excellent service: the parcel was appropriately packaged and shipped promptly.  It arrived in good condition very quickly.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: We use Grub Rub on almost everything.  It is definitely our go-to seasoning for all of our grilling. I don't use it as much for inside cooking, but it would work.

review/summary: Great for chicken!
review/text: Friend recommended this rub to me a few years back but it's kind of tough to find so I went to Amazon and loaded up.  Great for chicken on the grill.  Just sprinkle it on and let it sit for a few minutes (no need to marinate hours in advance which I never plan ahead for) and the chicken has turned out juicy and very flavorful every time.  Family loves it!

review/summary: Best of the lot
review/text: I read the reviews, considered the source and complaints, then ordered. Was I happy, you bet. Added 1/2 cup dried milk to 2 cups water in the blender, mixed, added the rest of the water and was done. Strained it to be sure all was mixed, no lumps. Taste was the same as I remembered of fresh skimmed milk from the dairy case(after drinking UHT processed milk). Cheaper, better taste, and a lot more convenient than buying UHT. Most people don't realize that powdered milk and instant powdered milk are two different products, one being a low temperature process and the other a high temperature process, and the instant is like over-cooked, changed taste, but easy to mix.<br />Thats the trouble with UHT (ultra high temp) milk. Just don't taste like fresh milk.

review/summary: Got milk?  Yes, always!
review/text: Maybe it's easier to mix because I only do a glass at a time, but it really isn't difficult. I just stir it briskly with a spoon, smoosh a couple lumps, and it's good to go on my cereal. So don't be put off by that because this makes the name-brand stuff seem tasteless. It's much creamier, smells like real milk, and a bargain at that price.  I'll be buying it again.
