review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are ground yellow corn, corn gluten meal, and chicken by-product meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a cheap corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs." Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Friskies at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, dry foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/summary: Seems to taste great!
review/text: I have a 16.5 year old dog who doesn't much care for food and will not stop losing weight. Basically if she likes it, she gets it out of desperation (minus toxic foods of course). She also gets sick of things - even when I find something she loves, it'll only work 1-3 times at most. She LOVES this food. Yes, I said dog; I buy this for my dog. When she's having her 'I hate everything days' which are almost always, I can still get her to inhale a couple of these. If you have a picky eater -try it. However -if your picky eater is a dog, check with your vet before feeding it cat food!! (My dog has many specialists, I won't bore you with the details, but she's been cleared to eat this long term.)  Also you just can't beat $10.20 shipped for 24 cans.

review/summary: A great base for my cat food blend
review/text: I use Purina Cat Chow 3.5 pound bag of dry food as the base for my blend of four different foods for my two cats. I purchase these four bags, sit down with two large plastic containers and mix the four together. I keep them stirred so the four are well-blended. My two females love the taste of each of the four and they are getting the benefits of all four varieties (at least that is what my mind thinks). Here are the four:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001RWU32">Purina Cat Chow (3.5-lb bag)</a><br />Purina Cat Chow, 3.5, usually the Complete Formula<br />Purina Cat Chow Indoor Formula (3.5-lb bag)<br />Purina Cat Chow Indoor Formula with the grass in the dry food, 3.5 lb.<br />Friskies Dental Diet for Cats (3.15-lb bag)<br />Friskies Dental (I used Purina until the stores stopped carrying it), 3 lb<br />Purina Cat Chow Healthful Life Adult Formula Dry Cat Food (3-lb bag)<br />Purina Healthful Life Adult, 3 lb.<br /><br />While I am mixing, one cat who adopted me, prances around, licking her lips in anticipation, until I put out a few pieces for a taste (like a child licking the candy spoon). The other one who does not have food issues lies patiently yet thinks she is getting such a treat when I put out a few pieces for her. She likes the Dental flavor the best.<br /><br />When I finish and put out a fresh bowl of food and water,  you talk about happy! The first one, Mizu, has snacked so much she eats just a few bites, then she's gone. Next Molly stretches and walks nonchalantly to the bowl and has her few bites. Cats are so cool!<br /><br />So are Purina and Friskies cat food!<br /><br />Note: As we all know, it is controversial to write reviews about Cat Chow. You can see the excessive amount of no-votes as a result.

review/summary: Best gouda I've ever had
review/text: I'm a bit astounded at another reviewer, who claims to love cheese, giving this a bad review on price alone, then noting that he spent about a buck fifty per pound, including shipping. Egad. You couldn't pay me to pay that much for... er... anyway.<br /><br />Oh, the cheese! This gouda is a wonderful, wonderful thing. I won't bore you with the foodie's description -- I don't taste apples or coffee or chocolate or tomatoes or oakmoss or anything else in this cheese. I taste a damn fine gouda -- dare I say, the finest gouda I have ever tasted. The five-year aging does give it a drier and crumbly texture than you might expect from a younger gouda -- think something like a pecorino.<br /><br />Anyway, buy this cheese. I picked it up at a local shop, but if you can justify the cost of buying it online, go for it!

It's difficult to find in my local store (they carry Fiesta brand seasonings, but I can't find this one), so I buy in bulk online in the large containers so we never run out. I've tried a TON of seasoning blends designed for various meats and have found them all to be JUST OK. However, this seasoning adds the WOW to every dish. My entire family loves it! I would definitely give this product a 5-star rating!!!

review/summary: Good seltzer flavors
review/text: We got the three-pack of all three flavors in an assortment with our SodaStream machine purchase. I just re-ordered the orange here (our favorite).<br /><br />As SisiL78 said (previous review), you add the flavor after carbonating. You can adjust the flavor to be as strong or weak as you like, although it's definitely best to lightly flavor seltzer; we use it in place of purchasing Polar seltzer.  The assortment right now includes orange, lemon-lime, and raspberry.  Probably the company "upgraded" the berry to raspberry at some point.<br /><br />We just purchased a set of glass eyedropper bottles to keep these in, since pouring is an imprecise method of dispensing the flavor, and my husband and I like our seltzer flavored differently (so we flavor by the glass, not the whole bottle).  We also like one drop of raspberry with 2 drops of lemon-lime to simulate the raspberry-lime Polar flavor.<br /><br />I'm glad they're stored in glass (to avoid the plastic-y taste a lot of beverages can have).  Also, they aren't sweetened, which is very important to us. You have to be careful, some flavors say 'no artificial sweeteners', then end up containing splenda or stevia (since technically these are natural). We wanted flavorings with no sweeteners and these fit the bill for a good price.  Now, if only they had more variety it would be perfect.

review/summary: Read the description and instructions!
review/text: To the review below. For starters you're supposed to add this flavoring to the soda AFTER carbonation. And this isn't going to be soda flavor, more like seltzer "essence" like the no calorie no sweetener seltzer you buy from companies like Polar.<br />The flavor is more of just a hint of berry or orange or lemon/lime.<br />I personally LOVE this product. The soda stays fizzy forever (we left a half of a bottle with the cap on outside fo the fridge for over a week while we were on vacation. We came back and the soda is still fizzy.). You can control the fizz and we don't have to run out for a case of seltzer everytime my boyfriend realizes he's out. Plus, if you're concerned about wasting less and drink alot of seltzer then you'll quickly realize how many fewer bottles you leave out for recycling (better to not use in the first place instead of recycle!!!)<br />Try a Torani or Monin syrup if you want "real" soda. Personally I hate the Sodastream sweetened soda flavors, they were too artificial tasting. Thankfully they came as a free sampler pack so we didn't waste any money on them.

review/summary: Extremely subtle flavor. A bit too subtle for me.
review/text: These are not for me. I wasn't looking for something sweet necessarily, but something more flavorful that this. When more is added than called for, it seems to only increase the carbonated water taste (I enjoy drinking carbonated water plain but this made it almost too bitter) and when too little is used, I can't taste it at all. I think if it was very gently sweetened, I would enjoy it more only because then I could actually TASTE a difference.<br /><br />I'm tempted to try the other flavors (should have gotten the variety pack instead of this one but I almost always love a berry flavor over anything else so I thought it was a safe bet) because this really is very much the type of thing I normally like. I'm disappointed I don't!<br /><br />If you're looking for something sweet or strongly flavored, this is definitely not the flavoring for you.

review/text: I keep a candy dish of these at work, for myself and co-workers.  Bit-O-Honey is a great little pick me up.  Tasty sweet, yet low in fat.  If you have never had Bit-O-Honey before, the predominant flavor is almond, not honey.  While honey is an ingredient, it is in the "less than 2%" section of ingredients.  The pricing found on here was the best I could find, and is even better with Subscribe and Save.<br /><br />I had a hard time tracking down ingredients and nutritional information for these online.  Some of the data found was out of date.  Here is what is on my package:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Corn Syrup, Sugar, Nonfat Milk, Hydrogenated Coconut Oil, Almonds, And Less than 2% of: Honey, Salt, Egg Whites, Canola and/or Safflower and/or Palm Oil, Modified Soy Protein, Natural Flavor, TBHQ, and Citric Acid.<br /><br />Nutritional Info:<br />Serving Size = 6 pieces (40.0 g)<br />Amounts Per Serving<br />Calories = 160<br />Calories from Fat = 27<br />Item = Value - % Daily Value*<br />Total Fat = 3.0g - 5%<br />Saturated Fat = 2.0g - 10%<br />Polyunsaturated Fat = 0.2g<br />Monounsaturated Fat = 0.8g<br />Sodium = 120mg - 5%<br />Total Carbohydrates = 32.4g - 11%<br />Sugars = 19.0g<br />Protein = 0.8g<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 1%

review/text: I find this candy hard to find in stores and I love it because it is low in fat and sugar.  Also gives me a lot of "chewing" for fewer calories.  Candy is soft and fresh always.  I order this whenever I run low.

review/summary: I Really Missed These
review/text: These candies have become increasingly difficult to find in stores.  Glad to find them here at Amazon.  They're a wee bit smaller than the bits you find in the candy bar.  I prefer these because they're slightly cheaper per ounce and I don't feel obligated to eat six at a time like when you unwrap a new bar.  Although it is sometimes hard to resist opening just... one... more....

review/text: Although these were dated July of 2011, I found them to be hard and tough to chew.  You had to let them soften up in your mouth before you were able to chew them.  I've purchased the full sized bars from Amazon before, and they were good.  Very fresh and not hard.  I had planned on putting these in Christmas baskets, but unsure as to whether or not I should.  Very disappointed.

review/summary: Fragrant, Rich, Smooth Jamaican Blue Mtn blend Coffee
review/text: This is my favorite coffee with it's charming fragrance and delicious rich smooth flavor. I use less of the coffee beans compared with my previous coffee blend (previous favorite) since this coffee is much richer and fuller bodied and smooth than any coffee I drank before. I ordered four pounds for this month already. I usually make real Espresso (pump) coffee with my Gaggia machine; but I have been using the drip method (burr grinder) since I wanted to try it out first. It is wonderful tasting just plain without milk or anything added. I did try it with milk too and it tasted good; but I prefer to drink it plain so I can taste the flavors.

review/summary: Not pure Blue Mountain, but good coffee at fair price
review/text: As others have noted, this is not 100% Blue Mountain (hence "Blend" in the name). Anybody who has tasted pure Blue Mountain will detect this at first sip. It has none of the mellowness, roundness, and balance of pure BM. Even among the Blue Mountain blends that I have tasted, this is certainly not the best (try the Japanese Blue Mountain blends from Key Coffee and UCC Coffee, which are excellent).<br /><br />However, it is a fair price for a good coffee. As long as you're not kidding yourself thinking that you're drinking real Blue Mountain, this coffee is better than pretty much anything you'll find at Starbucks, and is priced fairly.

review/text: I bought this at [...] for a fraction of the price (~$[...]).  For that much money, I don't regret trying it, but it wasn't as good as I had hoped and I'd definitely never pay [...].  It's only a blend, not 100% Jamaican Blue Mountain in case you didn't catch that.  It's probably about 10% JBM.  To me, it had the smell of the real stuff, but only a hint of the taste.  Moreover, that hint was about all of the taste it had.  Of course even on here this stuff is about half the price of 100% JBM.  However, unless aroma is all you care about, you can get much better coffees for this kind of money.  Bottom line, if you know and like good coffee, get something else.

review/text: My husband and I first received this coffee as a gift and we've been buying it ever since! The blend is extremely smooth, without any bitterness, "bite" or that jittery caffeine feeling. We buy whole bean and the beans are always perfectly roasted and very fresh.<br /><br />And, the value for the two-pound bag is amazing! This coffee compares very comparably, even with some of the so-called Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee - the stuff that supposedly is pure Blue Mountain coffee. I repackage the coffee into one pound bags and grind the beans fresh daily for coffee house quality coffee for only pennies. We buy again and again...

Okay, if you want to drink phony Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee--no problem mon!  But, you if need to drink one best coffee's in world buy only 100% Certified Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee from my Jamaican relatives homeland and it is worth every penny in smell, richness and taste.

review/summary: Helps with nausea!
review/text: I had never heard of "Vernor's Ginger Ale" before my neighbor (originally from Detroit, Mi) recommended it for my daughter's morning sickness. I don't like to over-medicate and, fortunately, my daughter feels the same. I'm not a fan of ginger ale, only having tasted "Canada Dry Ginger Ale", but this stuff is fantastic! It doesn't attack the senses in a harsh way with too much effervescense. It settled my daughter's nausea right away. She loved the taste! Also, knowing that it's one of the country's first homemade carbonated drinks, was also a plus.<br />My daughter, now six months pregnant, starts her day with a Vernor's and always has one in the car, chilled, with her. In case she gets an "attack".<br />Highly recommend "ericfinnegan" as a seller. Shipped quickly, well pckged, and great price!

review/summary: My favorite ginger ale!
review/text: I know, some people feel like once you've had one ginger ale you've had them all. That's because they haven't tried Vernor's. This stuff has to be the best ginger ale I've ever had & the taste is so different that I really hesitate to even put it in the same category.<br /><br />This stuff is supposedly barrel aged & maybe that's what give it that wonderful taste. I've given this to more than one person & they were all shocked by how different it tastes than the normal ginger ale. This isn't as sharp or artificial tasting as some of the other stuff out there.<br /><br />The only downfall of this brand is that no matter where you get it from, it's pretty expensive. The price here on amazon is about a dollar more than what I pay at my local store, but depending on where you live this won't be as bad of a price.

review/summary: Regional Ginger Soda from Michigan
review/text: I like "Vernor's", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866. If you look at the can it is called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost sutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is "The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.

review/summary: The best gingerale, bar none!
review/text: I grew up in Detroit, which way back when was an absolutely beautiful city (1960s, before the race riots).  The city has been on a decline, sometimes faster, sometimes slower, ever since.<br /><br />The German and immigrant population from Poland and other 'old countries' strove to assimilate into there new country quickly.  Luckily from their new country, they bought some of their recipes from the homeland.  One of those was Vernor's ginger ale.<br /><br />Aged in oak casks for a variety of taste that is unsurpassed in this type of product.<br /><br />Very Highly recommended.  The fact that it is hard to get and expensive just reinforced the allure of the product.<br /><br />Of course, it all comes down to taste.  And that's were Vernor's shines.  Truly a cut above!

review/summary: Smaller Bar Same Price
review/text: [edit to previous review below]<br />Imagine my surprise when my bars arrived today. Same Shop and Save order, same order history, smaller bars and NO notification to indicate the size of the bar had changed. It is essentially NOT the same product. Shame because the taste is still good but terrible service on the part of the manufacturer not to notify buyers of the change to the product. It dropped from 2.2 oz to 1.8 oz and is now more of a snack than lunch.<br /><br />*Original Review:<br />Love these bars - satisfies my chocolate craving in a good and healthy way. Like these better than Larabar - no aftertaste and better price.

review/summary: chocolate & cashew bar
review/text: These are great because they don't taste like health food.  They're of a pretty decent size and I had no problems with digesting them; I didn't feel sick or anything.  It's just nice to have a little chocolate and know that it isn't going to ruin your system at the same time.

review/text: I consider these the best bars on the market offering the winning combination of all organic ingredients, 90% to 100% raw, great taste, somewhat low sugar content and vegan.  The Chocolate & Cashew bars taste like a rich fudge.  The Chocolate & Hazelnut and Chocolate & Coconut are really tasty too!  The bars are sweetened with agave nectar and dates.  Thank you to Raw Indulgence for creating an outstanding product!

review/summary: Great!
review/text: These bars are really good as a snack on-the-go or even as a sweet treat after meals. I've just recently started diving into the organic and health food market, and so far I'm impressed. At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like these bars - organic is one thing, but "raw" seemed like another. I've been used to that certain taste of sugar and additives that usally go along with snack bars like these, and thought for sure the difference was going to be a lot bigger. Certainly, it tastes a bit different, but it's a different, REAL* food taste that I can get used to. These bars have the necessary sweetness that cover up the fact that these things are actually kind of good for you. From one junk food lover to another, these things are great!

review/summary: pretty good bar...
review/text: This bar is pretty good, but the chocolate taste is not a very true chocolate.  It has a bit of a strange aftertaste, but not unbearable.  It definitely tastes like health food, which isn't always a bad thing, if you are expecting it.  Just don't think this bar will replace your Snickers, because you will be sorely disappointed- but if you are a health nut looking for a sweet snack, give it a try.  (Maybe just buy one first, before the whole box, because I wish I had done that!!!)

review/text: Another fairly decent ultra healthy bar from these wonderful food makers. I think the chocolate is almost on par with the Cashew flavor. Pretty much the same kind of thing with some cocoa involved. I like them. The calorie content is similar to a mini meal which is perfect for breakfast. Expect a semi-sweet bar with a hint of bitterness. They are actually very good imo.

review/summary: Pure Ingredients, Filling and Tasty!
review/text: This is a fantastic raw, natural product.  Anyone in the raw/natural/organic food world will enjoy this immensely.  There are no "filler" ingredients and the taste is great.  The bitterness of the chocolate is nicely offset with agave to give you a smooth chocolate taste that's not sickeningly sweet.<br /><br />I read a few negative reviews before purchasing this product and was glad I tried it anyway.  A comment on the negative reviews - - if you're coming from the land of Reese's Cups and Cocoa Puffs, please don't waste your time buying this product.  I mean no criticism, simply that people accustomed to a raw/natural diet have different tastes.<br /><br />Also - my only "negative" - I did encounter some small hard pieces (nut hulls?) in a few of the bars.  They were like teeny, tiny rocks.  One of them got me pretty good!  But the bars are tasty - I just chew slower now, which is probably a good idea anyway.

review/text: Incredibly smooth, flavorful, overall, a high quality coffee. You'll only know it once you try it. I've been using this brand of coffee in the packets for about 4 months now. And being the coffee-snob I am I wouldn't stick with something unless it was truly worth it. These are definitely worth it. I've noticed the price increase about $1 or so, and I can truly understand it. This is one delicious brand of coffee, and they pack so much flavor into those packets, you can run about 2 pots thru, using the same packet. They definitely start with a high quality coffee bean and as for this particular flavor, it actually reminds me of butter pecan ice-cream the minute i took a sip. I love a nutty coffee and this does the trick. Give it a try, you won't be sorry. In fact it saves you money from buying cup after cup from your local deli or the usual suspects (starbucks, DD, etc.). Trust me after this, you'll never buy outside coffee again!! (Well maybe once in a while because you're running late :-)
