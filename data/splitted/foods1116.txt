review/summary: Prefer store brand Columbian
review/text: I usually drink my coffee black, no cream, no sugar.  I tried this coffee that way and it was drinkable but too bitter for my taste to repeat the brew.  I'm sure it would be pretty good with a ton of sugar and whipped cream, which is how I will finish off the bag.  That makes it only useful as a desert coffee to me, not a daily drink.

review/summary: Vanilla flavor overpowers coffee
review/text: Starbucks coffee is intense, flavorful and rewarding.  So adding vanilla flavor to it seems redundant..and it is.  This is a very powerful flavored coffee.  If you are into flavord coffees, then you will love this. If you're a purist...skip it.

review/summary: Great taste, wish it were organic and fair trade
review/text: This coffee is "100% responsibly grown, ethically traded."  Sounds good, although I'd rather them have it certified Fair Trade and organic.  But they're on the right track.<br /><br />Before I got my free bag of Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I'd been using various organic brands of espresso roast or french roast ground beans for my iced mocha every morning.  Chocolate syrup + 2 shots of espresso + milk + ice = a very tasty coffee.  And that coffee and chocolate taste was good.<br /><br />Once the vanilla natural fusions arrived, I used it in my normal iced mocha.  It tasted a little off at first.  I wasn't used to the vanilla taste.  And there IS a vanilla taste.  And smell.  It's a really pleasant, delicious vanilla, actually.  Once I got used to it, I really like the addition of the vanilla to my concoction.  That bag was quickly used up, and I went back to the half-used regular coffee bag.  I quickly decided to buy another bag of the vanilla natural fusions next time coffee was on my shopping list. :]<br /><br />And yeah, it is nice that you can bring in the empty bag for a tall brewed coffee at any Starbucks.

review/summary: not bad, but not great
review/text: Just for some background, I drink coffee on a regular daily basis, mostly making my own lattes and regular brew coffee.<br /><br />I purchased this product not expecting too much as I am not a fan of pre-grounded coffee beans, but I was very much surprised by the freshness of these grounds. I have not been a big fan of "flavored" coffee since I enjoy the natural taste of coffee with only milk. I tried this out as normal brew coffee and was greatly disappointed. Instead of enhancing the flavor of the coffee, the vanilla just tasted a bit awkward to me. This left me dissatisfied. I thought, "oh what about a vanilla latte?" and decided to try out a latte with this. It was actually pretty good, a hint of vanilla and not too overwhelming.<br /><br />So my ending verdict is that it is great as a latte, but not as a regular coffee. I'm not sure if I want to buy this product again unless it is on sale, but it's definitely worth a try if you are a casual drinker of coffee.

review/summary: I really wanted to like this coffee!
review/text: I generally like Starbucks coffee, and really wanted to like this one. But I found it has a very strange, and to me, unpleasant aftertaste. My first thought was that the aftertaste was like a weak cough syrup. I tried making a couple of other pots, one weaker and one stronger. It didn't seem to help. The after taste was still there, but weaker on the weaker pot. I tried putting milk in the coffee and that helped some, but didn't bring out any vanilla flavor. The coffee does have a good vanilla scent. I can't recommend this coffee, which disappoints me because vanilla is one of my favorite flavors and scents.

review/summary: Understated vanilla as advertised in a smooth coffee
review/text: Flavored coffees can be fun for mixing things up or even when you create your own coffee blends by mixing and matching. The vanilla in this coffee fusion is indeed understated as advertised, and you certainly do not get the overpowering "fragrance counter" experience when you open the bag for the first time. This I like as some of the flavored coffees in the past had been so overdone. The sense of smell varies from person to person, but I did get a pleasant yet understated vanilla sensation.<br /><br />The coffee itself is nice and smooth, perhaps an after-meal or a slow weekend morning coffee, or an afternoon/evening coffee - if caffeine doesn't keep you up at night that is!<br /><br />One negative on the packaging - especially for people who like to keep their coffee in the original bags: this bag is too short when full, making it harder to seal the air out.<br /><br />One positive on the packaging that will also please the environmentally conscious: if you check the side of the bag, it says you can take the empty bag to a Starbucks store and receive a free tall coffee in return.

review/summary: Pretty good coffee
review/text: This is actually very tasty, but having the Starbucks name on it lead me to believe it was gooing to be great.  It's not.  No complaints but it's not the best either.  I've reviewed some other brands that were actually better.  I am very particular about vanilla.  Artificial vanilla is an abomination.  Genuine vanilla, just like coffee has a pretty wide range of flavors and quality levels.  This one may be natural but its not quality.  I found the vanilla in this to be aromatic but a bit underwhelming as far as flavoring.  The coffee was good but just a little bitter when consumed black.  Sugar and cream smooth it out but that pretty much defeats the point of getting a preflavored coffee as far as I'm concerned.

review/summary: Good Taste, Less Filling.
review/text: I've never bothered to buy Starbucks ground coffee before--I'm a Millstone Man when it comes to national brands. Right off the bat, the grounds are much finer than I am accustom to handling. A little bit goes a long ways; I made the mistake of spooning in my usual measure, which knocked out the sample bag in two weeks. Now, I'm one of those sinful folks who'll reuse the same grounds for a couple pots before I change out. This brand seemed to spend itself in the first go around, so I had to refill daily. The taste definetely smacks of vanilla, but it isn't particularly rich or smooth. I care about packaging, and this one was easy to open and didn't rip on me. The tabs are long enough to keep the bag sealed. In short, it does all of the basic things that a commercial bag of ground coffee should do, and no more. Keep in mind that as a Vine Reviewer, I only got one bag instead of two, so I can't comment much on the price tag. Just know that if you drink lots of coffee daily, and you like it heavy, this stuff will go fast.

review/summary: Disappointng
review/text: Mmmmmm....coffee.....love it!  Ok, I'm not a coffee master/aficionado/snob, but I know how I like my coffee: strong with cream and sugar.  Please take that into account, as your preferences may differ.  As with any coffee one is not familiar with, it takes some experimentation to figure out how to make it "just right."  That's my experience anyhow.  So, I usually brew it up a couple different ways to see how it will come out and adjust from there.<br /><br />First, I followed the instructions on the package and made a pot in a drip coffee maker.  This produced a strong coffee, but it was nasty!  The taste was like someone had dropped in an excessive amount of vanilla extract or sugar free vanilla flavoring.  Kind of like getting a vanilla latte in a tourist trap area.  The next pot, I backed off by reducing the grounds by two scoops and left the amount of water the same.  This produced a weaker but still good coffee taste with very mild hint of vanilla flavoring.  *Much better* in my opinion, and very palatable.  For the third pot, I went for iced coffee, cold brewing in a French press, using the original instructions. The product was very smooth and tasty.  Letting it sit in the fridge overnight after brewing enhanced the flavor.  Finally, I hot brewed it in the French press, again using the original mix ratio from the package.  Sadly, the taste again not so good, though not as bad as the first pot.<br /><br />In the end, I did find two brewing methods that I liked.  While I would have preferred a stronger vanilla flavor, I wasn't able to get it out of this product before I finished the package.  Perhaps some more experimenting is in order, but, for now I will stick with another brand that I already enjoy.

review/summary: Strong robust coffee without the bitterness
review/text: I have to admit, I was skeptical as I always am when it comes to flavored coffees. Flavored coffee usually does not taste good at all to me since it almost always comes at the price of having some kind of weird taste associated with the coffee flavor. This vanilla-flavored coffee has done a great job of mixing good coffee and flavoring without too much of that "weird taste" to it, however it doesn't altogether avoid it. If I were to wager a guess I'd say that there is some process that adds the flavoring and ensures it doesn't lose its potency which is the culprit for most flavored coffees having that strange taste, usually in the form of what I can only call a chemical-taste. Starbucks has minimized this, thankfully.<br /><br />I brew mine on the strong side, and usually put in more than what the package calls for because otherwise the coffee winds up on the weak side. Don't do that with this brand, or at least with this line of their brand. They are right on the money with the measurement. The first morning I brewed this it opened my eyes, but only because it was overwhelmingly strong. The next day it was much better after I toned down the amount. The brew turned out rich, strong, bold, and the vanilla flavor is very much a part of the aroma and taste. You won't need to worry about a weak pot of coffee that looks watery and tastes thin.<br /><br />The 11-ounce bag lasted about 2 weeks, with me drinking a pot brewed with 4 cups a few days a week. If you like flavored coffee, you will more than likely enjoy this and I'd say give it a shot. If you're a big coffee snob, then it's probably not for you. For the record I'm a borderline coffee snob, and although I wouldn't go out of my way to order it, I wouldn't turn down a cup if it was offered me like some of the other flavored coffees out there.

review/summary: Major Disappointment
review/text: I love vanilla flavored coffees. In fact, until I tried this one, there wasn't a vanilla flavored coffee I'd ever tried that I didn't like. But the Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee was a major disappointment. I found this coffee to be very coarse tasting and bitter. Even using double the amount of creamer and sweetener I would use did not smooth down the grating roughness of this disaster. I tried to give it a fair shake and  used up half the bag before I couldn't take it anymore. I ended up having an idea and mixed the remaining half a bag with a full brick of unflavored dark roast coffee from a well known brand available at most any grocer. Finally I was left with a lightly vanilla flavored coffee that was flavorful, smoothed out to a drinkable state, and still had a good vanilla flavor. So there you have it: Alone, it's a disappointing and practically unpalatable disaster; cut it with some average run-of-the-mill coffee and it can become pleasing enough to drink.

review/summary: Throw a fancy name on coffee and it's still just coffee
review/text: First off, let me say bravo for a vanilla coffee that isn't French vanilla.  For a while I thought that was the only vanilla that could be used in coffee.  Second, I prefer Starbucks over most brands simply because it has a bold, strong coffee taste.  Essentially, it tastes like coffee.  It never tastes watered down or over flavored.  The same can be said about their new Natural Fusions ground Coffee.  Now don't get me wrong, it's great coffee, but "natural fusion" doesn't seem to make the coffee taste any different or better.  I never understood how a label such as that, or organic, or all natural, is supposed to give the impression that the coffee is better than the, I guess, regular version of the product.  This is good coffee, I could care about it's marketing label.

review/summary: A pleasant brew
review/text: I normally grind my own whole beans, but I always keep a couple of bags of ground coffee around for a quick brew, or when friends stop by.  I must first caveat my review by saying that I love many of the offerings at the local Starbucks store, but I am not a huge fan of their coffee.  In the case of this Natural Fusions Vanilla flavored coffee, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Some vanilla-infused coffees have a harsh, chemical taste, or taste more like vanilla than coffee.  Starbucks seems to have found a good balance between vanilla and coffee flavors.  The vanilla is not overpowering, but you know it is there.  The components of vanilla come from ground vanilla beans and Indian sarsaparilla root.<br /><br />I was a little taken aback by two of the items on the ingredient list.  Corn Maltodextrin?  Is it just a filler, or is it there for sweetness?  Vegetable Glycerin?<br /><br />Overall, this coffee is a notch above some of the other vanilla infused coffees out there, and I would recommend it for the occasional cup.

review/summary: Likable but not spectacular
review/text: I am married to a coffee purist who will only drink black coffee and frequently turns up her nose at even flavored coffees such as Natural Fusions Vanilla from Starbucks. I on the other hand love to adulterate my coffee with cream, and especially flavored cream. It's not that don't enjoy black coffee--I do quite a bit--but that I also enjoy the robustness of coffee mingled with more subtle flavors. The best combinations are those which allow you to taste both the coffee and the added flavor, without one overpowering the other.<br /><br />This is my first exposure to Starbucks Natural Fusions, and I wasn't sure what to expect. I decided to serve the coffee to a group of friends and see what we all thought of it (including my coffee-snob spouse!). The results were positive; everyone liked it, but certainly not rave reviews. My wife said "I like it--for a flavored coffee it's not bad." I thought it was tasty, just a hint of sweetness, and not overpowered with vanilla flavor. It did not have an oily feel like some bad flavored coffees I've run into in the past. Overall it was pleasant, tasty, and enjoyable, but perhaps not so good I'll be running out to the store to buy more. I'd give it a solid 3.5. I'll probably just go back to my usual Sumatra beans or Kona Blend, but this is a nice break from time to time.<br /><br />If you're a vanilla lover, or flavored coffee lover, I'd say it's certainly worth a try. If you're a coffee purist, you can safely skip it.

review/text: I was very happy to receive a bag of this coffee to review, but need to admit up front that I am not typically a flavored coffee drinker.  I tend to drink my coffee black and bold, so this lightly flavored, more mild coffee was a departure for me.  The scent is lovely and the flavor is refreshing, although not intensely vanilla tasting.  It has a semi sweet hint and the taste lingers a bit after drinking, but not in any objectionable way.  For those who enjoy lighter and flavored coffees, you will likely really enjoy this refreshing blend.

review/summary: Tastes better than it smells, but not as good as it looks!
review/text: When Starbucks says natural, that's what they mean! I was surprised to open this bag of coffee and immediately smelled vanilla extract. It was so similar I got my little container of vanilla extract out of the cupboard and compared the two. This ground coffee definitely has natural flavoring. Unfortunately, I think it's a little too natural and too strong for my preferences.<br /><br />You know when you bake and a recipe calls for maybe a teaspoon of vanilla extract? That's because it's strong stuff! I'm convinced that the same approach wasn't taken when creating this coffee--no "less is more" approach when it comes to Starbucks using natural fusions, I suppose.<br /><br />Once I got past the smell, because I was still determined to taste it, I was pleasantly surprised. The taste is a lot more subtle than the scent. It still takes like coffee, not something spiced up like chai or other unnaturally flavored coffees. It has subtle spicy taste to it along with the natural vanilla. I attribute this to the sarsaparilla root. It made for an alright cup of coffee. It would be better if I couldn't smell it.<br /><br />I finished my mug, but I think I'll be passing the rest of the pack on to someone else who wants to try it and stick with my Starbucks House Blend or Breakfast Blend.<br /><br />FYI, Ingredients: ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root

He's a teenager and for some reason drinks his coffee black, although when my husband put cream and sugar in it, he liked it much better.<br /><br />My mother in law gave it a mixed review.  She thought it was better than most flavored coffees.  The vanilla flavor is genuine instead of artificial.<br /><br />My husband didn't like it.  His complaint with flavored coffee is that the vanilla flavor stays with you long after the coffee is gone.  He agreed that this is better vanilla flavored coffee than any other he's had, but it still wouldn't be what he'd choose.<br /><br />Personally, I discovered that I am not a Starbucks coffee person.  I love their iced coffee and drinks, but not their coffee.  I prefer a mix of Trader Joe's Columbian decaf and Joe Blend.  I did like the vanilla flavor though and if I were to choose a Starbucks coffee, it would be this one.<br /><br />The verdict:  if you like flavored coffee, you'll love Starbucks new version.  For ground coffee, it is also surprisingly fresh tasting.  If you don't like flavored coffee, then you probably still won't like this.  There is an aftertaste to it.

review/text: I'll be honest, I'm one of the few who isn't a big fan of Starbucks coffee. I think the coffee is a bit too bitter. So, I was reluctant to try this coffee.<br /><br />Having said that, I was very pleasantly surprised by the fact that this particular coffee is not at all bitter. But, that's where my excitement stopped. The coffee really didn't have much flavor. It didn't have that rich coffee taste. I also didn't taste any vanilla at all. I must admit, I'm used to freshly ground coffee, so the fact that this coffee is pre-ground may make a difference. I can't vouch for the whole bean option. However, with my experience, for the price, I'd look elsewhere.

review/summary: Nice
review/text: If you have read my other revews you know I LOVE coffee, especially that first cup in the monring. There was a time many years ago when flavored coffee was just about all that I wanted to drink. However I found if you take a good thing too far it ruins it for you.  I actually got burnt out. Lately I have started to drink some of the flavored coffies again and I have been enjoying them.<br />I was glad to review Starbucks Natural Vanilla coffee.  When I first opened the package a very pleasant aroma traveled to my nose. Smelled good. I used my regular little coffee pot to brew the coffee.  Again, the aroma floated in the room and it was pleasant.  Now for the taste test.  I was happy to say that it was good, pure and simple. The vanilla taste to me was not too strong but just strong enough to let you know you were drinking something different and special. It was smooth tasting, rather comforting, in a way and I liked it and enjoyed the cup.<br />I don't think, at least for myself and my family, that flavored coffee is what we would want for our 'wakin up' cup each morning.  However, for a special treat, a warm feeling and a sharing experience with others this is a very good coffee to use. Starbucks does a great job in trying to give their customers choices. It's also a good value. Give it a try.

Pleasant aroma though.<br /><br />Original review.<br /><br />Pros:  Not bitter.  Not burnt.  Fairly smooth.  Not weak, not strong.<br /><br />Cons:  Unpleasant aftertaste.  Could not detect vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Detailed review.<br /><br />Coffee is so subjective, you need to know about my usual coffee habits.<br /><br />Regular coffee drinker.  4 cups a day.  Drink coffee black, no sugar.<br />I like vanilla flavoring in a variety of products.<br />I regularly drink vanilla rice milk, and add extra vanilla extract.<br /><br />My usual morning coffee is Dunkin Donuts Original Blend, brewed fresh.<br />Occasionally buy Starbucks Morning Blend.  Don't like their stronger or bold coffee.<br />Several cups of Keuring, during the day.  Like Keuring Coffee People Donut Shop XBold best.  Also Caribou Sumatra.<br />Van Houte Vanilla is also pleasant enough.  Don't like weaker Keuring Coffee.<br /><br />I brew coffee using one scoop for each 6 oz cup, plus an extra scoop.  I use filtered water.<br /><br />I tried this coffee immediately after brewing and before food.  Immediate unpleasant aftertaste. At least it wasn't bitter or burnt.  It was evident there was some type of flavoring, but I couldn't detect any vanilla taste.<br /><br />Proceeded to drink a cup with my breakfast.  Aftertaste not noticeable when I had it with a meal.<br /><br />After eating, I had another cup.  Aftertaste came right back.<br /><br />Will not be finishing the bag.

review/summary: Just a Touch of Vanilla
review/text: Flavored coffee has never been a hit in our household----probably one reason could be we just haven't tried many.  The last we used was something so overpowering the flavor of the coffee was lost, never tried again until now.  I must say this is nothing like our previous experience.  The coffee is what you taste with just a hint of the Vanilla and it is great!  Taste is subjective, so what I like may not be to your liking at all.  If vanilla is a flavor you enjoy then I think you would enjoy a cup of this wonderful coffee.  I first tried a cup, by filling a K-Cup holder and running it through the Keurig, had to have a second cup.  Next day made a small pot, it disappeared fast.  I enjoy a good strong cup in the morning just to get my motor running, the vanilla makes it something just a little different.  Excellent coffee with a difference!

review/summary: Didn't stand out among my other coffees, but tasty
review/text: I am not a Starbucks lover, nor fan of any particular coffee joint, I just have my morning coffee at home and that is the extent of it.  I do love vanilla though, so was looking forward to trying this.  Well, upon opening the bag I could not smell the vanilla at all, it just smelled like the the other bag of coffee I had from Costco.  Brewed it up and I still didn't really taste the vanilla and wouldn't have noticed it was any different from my regular coffee (a ground hazelnut flavored coffee from Costco).  Granted I do add a flavored creme to my coffee, and some agave nectar, so I guess I like it sweeter than bitter.<br />Overall the coffee is well worth drinking, but I am not gaga over it, and will probably stick to my other cheaper bag coffee just to save a little money.

review/summary: Java, java, java, java, - JAVA !
review/text: Usually I am not a Starbucks fan.  I find their coffees to be bitter and generally too strong.  However, Natural Infusions Ground Vanilla coffee is a little smoother than most Starbucks coffee.<br /><br />The first thing you notice when you open the bag is a healthy, but not at all overpowering, vanilla aroma.  It is quite pleasant, providing you like the smell of vanilla.<br /><br />While brewing, the vanilla scent comes to life and will fill your kitchen.  The coffee itself is milder than most Starbucks offerings, but still not what I would consider smooth.  It still has that strong, almost bitter taste.  There is a definite flavor of vanilla in each sip, although it is a background flavor to the traditional Starbucks strong taste.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a decent cup of java, but still a tad too bold for my taste.  This ground seems very flavorful though; it would be nice to seem Starbucks tone down the bitterness a bit.<br /><br />But if you are a Starbucks lover and enjoy vanilla aroma and flavor, you may just love Natural Infusions!

review/text: I like this coffee alot, because I'm one who prefers a mild tasting vanilla rather than a flavor that's heavy or artificial. I took off one star due to the coffee being mild tasting as well. I was expecting Starbucks usual full bodied coffee...and it isn't. If you're looking for a richer coffee flavor, I'd try Melitta.

review/summary: Vanilla comes through strong and clear with Cold Drip Toddy System
review/text: Normally, I don't drink flavored coffees but I saw that Starbucks was using real flavorings rather then artificial ones, so I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />Generally, I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H0JVW">Toddy T2N Cold Brew System</a> and I wasn't sure if the vanilla flavoring would come through.<br /><br />I did a 24 hour cold brew with the 11 oz of pre-ground vanilla coffee with about two cups less water (since normally I do the cold brew with 16 oz of coffee).<br /><br />Well, the ground was perfect for the Cold Toddy system, the result was rich full flavored coffee syrup.  I have been mixing it with hot water for about one week and the Vanilla flavor is still coming through strong.<br /><br />The most surprising thing, though, was how quickly the water drained when I was making it.  The grind was perfect for the Cold Toddy system.<br /><br />I will definitely buy the Starbucks Natural Fusions again.

review/summary: Not very much Vanilla flavor but still a great tasting coffee.
review/text: I've always wanted to try some of the Starbucks coffee. Since we don't have a Starbucks in the little town that I live in and what they have in the grocery store is so expensive I haven't had a chance to till now. So when it was on my Vine List to try out I jumped on it.<br />  Most of the other vanilla flavored coffee's that I've tried have had a very strong vanilla flavor to them. So I usually have to cut it 2 to 1 or � & � with some Folgers to get the level of Vanilla flavor that I like.  But this Starbucks Vanilla Coffee doesn't seem to have very much Vanilla flavor to it at all. I made the first pot of it like I usually do with the flavored coffee's and mixed it 2 to 1, 2 parts Starbucks to 1 part Folgers. I could hardly taste the Vanilla at all in that pot so the next one I made with just the Starbucks coffee. This time it had a slight and very light Vanilla flavor. It was still a very good pot of coffee but it didn't have much of a Vanilla flavor to it.<br />  So if your looking for a flavored coffee with a lot of Vanilla to it then you will be disappointed. But if your looking for one with a slight and very lite Vanilla flavor in it then you will love this one. If you have never tried a flavored coffee I would definitely suggest trying this. It has just enough Vanilla to it to say that it does and it's a great tasting coffee.

review/summary: Very tasty, and exactly what you'd expect from Starbucks...
review/text: I like Starbucks coffee--what's not to like?  Bold flavor, very strong, good quality coffee.  I generally stay away from flavored coffees, as I just prefer the taste of the magic bean itself.  I received this bag as part of the Vine program, and I was excited to try it.  The vanilla flavoring in this coffee is pretty subtle, and I didn't think that it changed my enjoyment of the coffee itself--rather, it was a new note to enjoy within the coffee.  Definitely not an overpowering thing, and that is all to the good as far as I am concerned.  A solid coffee, it won't ever be my absolute favorite, but I have definitely enjoyed this bag.  I may purchase this again in the future.

review/summary: A fine flavored coffee from Starbucks
review/text: I drink a lot of coffee, but I am not a big fan of Starbucks. Generally, I prefer a lighter roast that is less bitter than regular Starbucks. The description mentioned this being a milder coffee, so I was pleased to have the opportunity to try it.<br /><br />I enjoy flavored coffees, although rarely vanilla. I usually find the vanilla to be so overpowering that it masks any taste of the coffee beneath. I was pleased to note that upon opening the bag, the vanilla smell was subtle and pleasant. So far so good. Even though I normally buy whole bean, this bag is pre-ground. I brewed it in my Bunn coffee maker, which is a drip brewer. The aroma while brewing was lovely!<br /><br />I would say that this is definitely a dark roast, although it is milder than regular Starbucks. There is still a certain degree of bitterness. The vanilla flavor is perfect - just the right amount. My husband said that adding (real) cream and a little sugar make his cup a real treat.<br /><br />This coffee would thrill regular Starbucks fans who enjoy vanilla. However, it is somewhat smoother and milder than regular Starbucks, so I think you could serve it to anyone and it would be enjoyable. (Please note, despite the vanilla flavor, it is definitely strong and has a serious caffeine punch.)

review/summary: A better Starbucks coffee
review/text: I've never been a big Starbucks coffee fan, for I always felt that it was much too strong, at least for my tastes. No matter how I would try to brew it at home, it just didn't taste good to me. Even in Starbucks locations I found the coffee too strong, so I was a little hesitant about testing out this new vanilla flavored coffee. I am pleased to report, however, that I am happy that I did.<br /><br /> This new edition of Starbucks coffee has a very subtle flavoring of vanilla, not enough to overpower the taste of the coffee, unlike the jarring tastes in other companies' flavored coffees. It's light and goes well on the palate, and the best part is that it is not strong as the other products from Starbucks. That alone rates a 5 star award from me!

review/summary: good flavored dessert coffee
review/text: I'm a major coffee-fiend, meaning something of a purist, so I rarely partake of flavored coffees, preferring the natural nuances of regional varietals.<br /><br />But a flavored coffee can be a nice touch after a meal, in lieu of, or with, dessert.  I'm loath to buy specialty beans for these limited purposes, and flavored beans also leave hard-to-remove residue in grinders, even more of an issue if you use a burr grinder, like I do, which has parts that shouldn't be wet-cleaned.<br /><br />So, step back to pre-ground coffee.  Starbucks takes a lot of flack for various reasons, but they reaaly do know their coffee, and always have big, robust flavors-- exactly what a coffee fiend desires.  This flavored blend is no exception, it's dark and rich, with modest-but-noticable vanilla notes.  I brewed it in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AFX53">Krups Moka Brew</a>, for which about 1.25Tbsp per cup of water worked well for drinking it black.<br /><br />The grind is fine; much too fine for a French Press, but suitable for a drip coffee-maker with paper filters.<br /><br />This isn't a flavor I would drink every day, and I especially don't see it as a morning cup, but for after-dinner coffee, it's Recommended.

review/summary: Lightly Vanilla'ed Starbucks Coffee
review/text: The idea of vanilla-flavored coffee sounded intriguing, and since Starbucks is relatively new at this I figured I'd give this blend a whirl.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you like vanilla in your coffee, this blend is a treat.  It's typical Starbucks coffee with a very mild (not overpowering) vanilla flavor infused.  It seems to be not as artificial tasting as some varieties I've purchased at the grocery store.  The brewing aroma is lovely and the grind worked great with our flat-bottomed metal filter.  Add a little milk and a little sugar and you've got yourself a cup of coffee candy.<br /><br />This makes for a fantastic dessert coffee, but it's a very pleasant day-brightener as well!

review/summary: Quite good!  More vanilla Please?
review/text: This Starbucks vanilla flavored coffee is really good, hot with sweetener and creamer.  But, I like to drink iced coffee.  I make a pot of coffee, and put in a packet of Stevia.  I pour bits at a time over ice in a large, tall mug with a straw and a screw top.  Delicious. Not too sweet, and VERY "coffee".  This coffee is as strong as the regular Starbucks dark roast types (which I prefer).  I make mine strong so that the drink gets better as the ice melts.  But, I still prefer THIS coffee hot with creamer and sugar.<br /><br />The vanilla is there in the taste, but this coffee could use more.  Otherwise, this is a definite winner, and I will buy it when it comes to stores.<br /><br />I am thinking this is a first for Starbucks to make a FLAVORED coffee.  I would like to see a chocolate flavored one.  I had chocolate flavored coffee in French Polynesia, and it is a winner as well.

review/summary: Starts off weak, gets worse
review/text: The back of the bag tells you to use two tablespoons or coffee for every 6 ounces of water when brewing this coffee. I did that, and the vanilla taste was very weak. This is strange, because my ground floor smelled strongly of vanilla after brewing, but you would not have known that from tasting the coffee itself.<br /><br />Since I had a week to use it after opening, I made it again and again each morning. With each passing day, the coffee would taste worse. Just the other day, I made some for a road-trip to the in-laws. My wife took a sip and said "oh, that's bad," and never touched it again. Yep, there was something about this coffee that just did not jive. At all. I'm sorry Starbucks, I have nothing against you, this coffee was just a big disappointment.

I'm not a fan of the vanilla flavors, but this one is quite nice, actually! If you are like me and you like a strong cup of coffee without a bitter edge, I highly recommend this one!

review/summary: The cadillac of coffees found flavorful
review/text: There is a huge difference between coffees that have added flavor that mask an inferior blend and flavored coffees that allow the coffee bean itself to be appreciated. I enjoy flavored coffee and French vanilla is a common variety both in the coffee itself and of course in creamers. This version by Starbucks is definitely a winner. The Vanilla tastes genuine - not chemical, and even with the addition of flavor, it was still apparent that there had been no shirking in the quality of the bean. The overall effect is very smooth, whether you like your coffee strong or a slightly less robust brew.My only regret was not having some real cream to add because this blend exudes luxury.

review/text: I like my coffee, but I'm no coffee-ophile or whatever the correct term might be. I have a Keurig for daily use but dusted off out trusty old Braun drip maker for this pack. I made mine on the lighter side as that is my taste. The aroma was just really enticing. Freshed brewed coffee and vanilla-they should make a Lysol version of this stuff. But anyway, The smell was a really pleasing beginning. It looked to be a nice strong cup despite me using less- that's a good thing in my book. I let it cool for a bit because that's what I usually do. Great first sip, no bitter after taste. Larger slug, still hot, but not burning, the aroma stays with you which is also good. The arome seamed natural, not "chemically" at all like some additives can be. I would order this again if it came up in K-cups at a reasonable price.

review/text: It's been a while since I've enjoyed a flavored coffee. I'm something of a purist and honestly, most flavored coffees taste artificial and over-done to me.  But Starbuck's has come through with a very natural-tasting vanilla-flavored coffee for coffee drinkers who want a bit more without the addition of a sugary syrup.<br /><br />The scent of the coffee is a nice vanilla-coffee blend with the vanilla more understated than I'd have expected. As it brews, the scent of vanilla rounds out the coffee aroma without ever overpowering it.  And the cup is smooth and almost velvety, pretty much all you could hope for from this sort of blend.<br /><br />I'm not saying they've won me over to the flavored coffee camp, but I will say that this is a cup of coffee I can respect in spite of the addition of a flavor. If you love vanilla coffee but hate artificial flavors, give it a try.  I think you'll be pleased.

review/summary: A Good Cup!  Starbucks' Vanilla Flavored Coffee:  A Critical Review
review/text: I have NEVER liked Starbucks' coffee.  This, in spite of loving the chain.  Nantucket Nectars, the cakes and the warm atmosphere are all a plus, but the coffee has always been horrible.<br /><br />There've been two main issues I've had with Starbucks' brand: the coffee was not robust and the bitter aftertaste lasted far longer than I'd like.  Even venturing back for a cup at different locations and at different times left me wanting something more desirable.<br /><br />However, this blend of Vanilla and light-medium Acacia and Sarsaparilla beans is quite good.  There's still a slight bitter after-taste but overall it's flavorful and has a nice veneer of vanilla that doesn't dominate (i.e. that you're not drinking Vanilla Quik) and not so weak that you've forgotten that it was an ingredient.<br /><br /> Better than average, but not exceptional.<br /><br />3.5 stars

review/summary: A Fine Dessert Coffee
review/text: I love Starbucks coffees. Always have. Yet I've been reluctant to try any of their flavored coffees because I'm not a big fan of sweetened coffee and most flavored coffees require sweetening to taste good. This is certainly true of Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla, as well.<br /><br />When the package was first opened I was impressed by both the rich and sweet aroma and the beautiful dark and oily grind which was accented by flecks of ground vanilla beans and Indian sarsaparilla root. I found it impossible not to put the opened bag under my nose and inhale deeply! This wonderful aroma continued throughout the brewing process.<br /><br />The flavor is quite good, medium in strength, with notes of mellow vanilla, an almost indiscernable hint of coconut, and a nutty finish. Like every flavored coffee, however, Starbucks Natural Vanilla requires some sort of sweetener to bring out its best flavors (at least for me). I tried a teaspoon of Stevia along with cream with my first cup. Meh. Added Coffee Mate Vanilla to the second cup, which was much better. But the best combination was achieved for me when I added Coffee Mate's Peppermint Mocha holiday creamer. That was the winning combination for me. This demonstrates that Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla is really a dessert coffee. And, as fate would have it, my package arrived in the mail on the day after Thanksgiving, which made each steaming cup the perfect companion to leftover slices of pecan and pumpkin pie!

review/summary: An Interesting Experiment
review/text: Starbucks is known for the very strong, almost burnt, flavor.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee</a> is something different.  On their web site, Starbucks bills it as "A blend of high-quality coffee with just the right touch of luscious, natural vanilla."  They also say "Enjoy with: A crumbly butter cookie (or two) and a pool of late-afternoon sunshine."<br /><br />How well do they pull it off?  The coffee has a very strong aroma of vanilla, a lot like freshly baked cookies.  The flavor is a mixture of the traditional Starbucks taste with an equal amount of vanilla.  For me, the two tastes do not do well when mixed together. The appeal of coffee and cookies to me, Starbucks web page ideal, is the contrast between the strong coffee and sweet cookies. How many people would like their coffee to smell and taste like cookies?  There may be some, but I cannot go for it.<br /><br />As for the claim of all-natural ingredients, corn maltodextrin is listed on the package as one of the ingredients.  The US FDA says this, "Maltodextrin ((C6H10O5)n, CAS Reg. No. 9050-36-6) is a nonsweet nutritive saccharide polymer that consists of D-glucose units linked primarily by [alpha]-1-4 bonds and that has a dextrose equivalent (D.E.) of less than 20. It is prepared as a white powder or concentrated solution by partial hydrolysis of corn starch, potato starch, or rice starch with safe and suitable acids and enzymes."  I guess it depends on what you mean by natural.

I did not think I would enjoy starbucks at home.<br /><br />But I was able to bring my favorite coffee shop home with me, and I really enjoyed it. I just brewed a pot and my house smells like a cafe.  Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee is so yumm! You can actually see the vanilla in the ground coffee! It is sooooo good! On my way to go get another cup now!

review/summary: Smooth
review/text: I found this flavored coffee didn't have the sharp bite of most Starbucks coffee. It's smoother and far less boisterous than the regular Starbucks. This made it a pleasant drinking experience for an evening dessert drink. I like a flavored coffee now and then but find most don't work beyond a single cup, they tend to get a bit nauseating. This Starbucks vanilla _did work_ for cup after cup with with a uniformly enjoyable reaction to every cup.<br /><br />The vanilla flavoring is light, more in the fragrance than the taste. It would make a good pairing with a not-too-sweet dessert, like dark chocolate or pastry.

review/summary: Good, if you like Starbucks coffee
review/text: I tested this coffee on two coffee-lovers, my wife and my sister.  My wife likes weaker, light-roast coffees and my sister likes stronger, dark-roast coffees.  We brewed one batch with a percolator and both tasted the same coffee.<br /><br />They both like the vanilla flavor -- it's subtle and not overpowering.  The vanilla aroma is good and as-expected.  However, for my wife who likes a lighter-roast, she didn't like the strong, "burnt" flavor of the coffee.  In fact, she said she finds most Starbucks coffees to be too bitter for her taste.  She had hoped that the vanilla flavoring would mask or counteract the expected bitterness, but alas it did not.<br /><br />On the other hand, my sister liked the coffee.  She likes dark-roasted coffee and already liked the Starbucks brand anyway.  So the vanilla coffee tasted good to her.<br /><br />The conclusion is that if you already like Starbucks brand coffees, then this Vanilla Flavored version is a winner.  If you have not tried Starbucks but like dark-roasted or stronger coffees, then give this one a try.  If you like lighter or weaker brews, then you might try this one with less than usual grounds per cup.  Or just look for a vanilla-flavored version of the brand you usually like.

review/summary: Refreshingly Light
review/text: The vanilla infused Starbucks ground coffee has a delicious flavor that is a fitting compliment to the Starbucks coffee line.<br /><br />The traditional Starbucks coffee is combined with a hint of vanilla that blends nicely with the nutty coffee flavor without compromising the quality.<br /><br />This combination did seem to be a bit stronger and it took a little to adjust the amount of coffee to achieve the desired balance, but once I compensated I was very pleased with the product and will continue to stock this as a must-have core item on my grocery list.

review/summary: Smooth and tasty, but lacking vanilla
review/text: My husband drinks coffee plain.  No sugar.  No milk.  Just coffee.  I got this for him and he had me try it.  It is very smooth.  There is no bite, and when I initially put the mug to my mouth, I could smell vanilla.  What was disappointing was that I could not TASTE the vanilla.  I took a few more sips, but every time, I could only smell the vanilla and not taste it.  My husband really likes it because he doesn't feel like he has to do the teeth-clench-swallow.  He says the vanilla taste is very subtle, so perhaps I am just missing it.  Either way, this is a very smooth blend in our Keurig.  It brews very well - not weak like some of the other varieties we have tried.  It smells divine, and goes is a great morning perk-up!

review/summary: Unique all natural flavored coffee
review/text: Starbucks will not use any artificial flavors in their coffee. For this reason, they were not quick to offer flavored whole bean or ground flavored coffee products. In the shops they offer to add flavoring to already brewed coffee. I was very impressed by the ingredients of this coffee. They actually added ground vanilla beans! The flavor of the ground vanilla beans really cuts through the much stronger coffee flavor. After all, vanilla is a subtle flavor. The coffee beans used are very robust in flavor, typical of Starbucks coffee.  They also add sarsaparilla root as well. Sold at a reasonable price, I highly recommend this coffee for those who appreciate a full bodied flavored coffee.

review/summary: OK but not the bestt
review/text: I thought I was going to really enjoy a Starbucks product that I could brew myself.  Well it is just OK.  It reminds me of a mediocre dark blend with a dash of imitation vanilla.  Again I think I could make a vanilla flavored coffee much better with some 8 o'clock coffee (Columbian) and a dash of real vanilla.  In fact I have compared this to the Starbucks Natural Fusions vanilla flavored ground coffee and I like 8 o'clock with flavored vanilla much better.  I will not be too harsh on my rating because it is not horrible coffee - just not the best I have had.  Sorry.

review/summary: Rich, not overpowering.
review/text: Most flavored coffees that I have tried are just too overpowering and artificial-tasting. This Starbucks Vanilla surprised me because it is neither, and didn't require mixing it with regular coffee to dilute the extra "flavor".  A cup of this with a little half-and-half gives a nice, creamy vanilla coffee experience with a mellow aftertaste.<br /><br />The package says these are "Latin American" beans, and the ingredients include the dreaded mysterious "Natural Flavor" (which includes "Corn Maltodextrin, Vegetable Glycerin"), and Ground Vanilla Beans and Indian Sarsaparilla Root.<br /><br />As to be expected, this product like other Starbucks coffees is, for my income level, far too expensive for regular use, but for an occasional treat, really hits the spot.

review/summary: Not so good
review/text: I should preface this review by noting that I am not a Starbuck's coffee drinker since I have not found it enjoyable in the past, and also that I always drink coffee black.  So, it was with hesitation that I tried the vanilla ground coffee. I did not expect much, but I also really went into it with a hopeful attitude that this time it would taste delicious.  Unfortunately, my previous experiences held up to be true once again.  The taste was bitter and sharp, not smooth and had a yucky "fake" taste.  I will say that the vanilla flavoring tasted more natural than some flavored coffees that I have tried, but it still wasn't great.  I'm really not a coffee snob and will drink just about anything else (!), so I hate to sound so negative, but this was my opinion of the product.

review/summary: Still too Dark  but Several of my friends liked it
review/text: I was interested in what Starbucks would do with a lighter roast with vanilla flavor since I like some flavored coffees especially chocolate raspberry. However, I found this roast was still too dark and bitter for me.  I tried it black, with creamer alone and with creamer  and sugar together and disliked it thorougly in all cases. I made a pot and shared it with friends:  Several of my friends enjoyed it thouugh others wouldn't even try it.  Overall, if you like Starbucks typical dark  roast and like (sweet) vanilla coffee this is likely to be something you will enjoy.

review/summary: Is this the same Starbucks?
review/text: I am a Starbucks junkie, gold card holder who gets either a mocha frappuchino or if it's a chilly day a simple mocha.  So I was thrilled to try a bag of their coffee at home.  Since I was in charge of the coffee maker down at Thanksgiving, I brought both this bag and a bag of decaf for the Grandmas.  I made the first pot when I arrived and was unhappy with how bitter it was, I had been expecting at least a vanilla aroma but there was no vanilla to be discerned in either the scent or taste.  Also when I looked into the bag, it the color of the grounds was far lighter than most of the coffees I make, and the grinds had what appeared to be wood chips in them (now I know that they weren't actually wood chips, but that's what they looked like.)  We drank several more pots of this coffee over the next few days as it was the only coffee that I'd brought, the volume of creamer and sweetner consumed had increased over the next several days.  It was simply too bitter, and did not have an attractive flavor.  I was very disappointed as there are very few Starbucks products that I don't care for - but this falls into that category.  It appears that I will still be brewing Dunkin Donuts coffee at home.  Currently at the price of thirteen dollars for two this is actually a good price should this coffee be to your taste.

review/text: I'm not usually a fan of flavored coffees, but I enjoyed this one. The coffee is mild to medium in strength, and the vanilla flavor is noticeable, but not overpowering. The brew was sweet without any bitterness. The grind was not entirely uniform and some very fine grinds came through the mesh filter I use.<br /><br />The bag opened and resealed easily, but I prefer tins.<br /><br />This is a fine occasional coffee. I'm not interested in a flavored coffee are my regular. The price is reasonable. My standard coffee is Melitta Classic Blend. They are both premium coffees, but neither is gourmet.

I also use a french press.<br /><br />The grind is a little fine for the french press - small pieces end up making it through the filter.<br /><br />The taste of the coffee is fine to me.

review/text: It is winter season and when it come to choosing Starbucks coffee most will go for gimgerbread or other holiday flavors.  But this Thanksgiving season, I have tried Vanilla flavored Starbucks ground coffee and it is nice way to start one's day.  It is not too bold of a flavor and sweetness is not overwhelming.  The fact that coffee was already ground speeds up the process of making a morning drink.  The fresh taste stay long after cup is finished.  I had mine with soy milk and I really enjoyed it.

review/text: I usually drink my coffee black and unsweetened without flavorings but thought giving the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a> a try would be a nice change of pace.  I was right.<br /><br />I found the vanilla to be medium-mild in strength with the aroma playing as much a part of the experience as the actual flavorings.  The vanilla was not overly pronounced or artificial but it was also not what I would consider subtle.  The flavor is there, it's persistent, and there's no mistaking that this is vanilla with a capital V without it being cloying.<br /><br />Would I purchase this in the future? Maybe on a whim but as I mentioned before, I like my coffee to taste like coffee.  Would I drink it if it was offered to me at someone's house?  Sure, it's not bad and it certainly beats those bottled flavorings or creamers with the chemical aftertaste.<br /><br />For those who enjoy flavored coffee this is a nice choice.  The coffee is full flavored and robust with a nice controlled infusion of vanilla flavor and aroma.

review/text: I took a chance on this coffee, and I do like the way it smells and infuses the air with scent. However, I much prefer a dark (VERY DARK) roast. I usually drink Starbux French Roast, Sumatra or Italian Roast, which are Bold or X-Bold coffees. This arabica flavored coffee just didn't cut it for me. It's a LIGHT roast, and too mild & too light for my taste.

review/summary: Smooth, with a hint of vanilla.
review/text: I traditionally drink my coffee with a little vanilla creamer. I usually brew a cup of Starbucks, house blend coffee, at home every morning and indulge from time to time in a white chocolate vanilla latte from Starbucks. (I know what some of you are thinking, that's not real coffee but hot chocolate.). Regardless, I usually don't like strong coffees and manipulate the directions to accommodate my tastes. When I selected this coffee, I hoped that it would be something that I would enjoy and I was not disappointed. Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla flavored was pleasing (remember, I used less coffee than the directions required) and not overwhelming. The way I prepared it, it had a rich (yet mild) flavor. It is a bit milder than most Starbucks coffee that I have purchased in the past, and not as acidic. It made for a decent cup of coffee.<br /><br />Scale: 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.<br />Packaging - 5 (You are able to secure the product once opened. Adhesive tape closes nicely insuring that the product remains fresh).<br />Flavor - 4 (It has a rich, mild taste and isn't acidic. I rate it a 4 because if I follow the directions on the package, the taste would be a little overwhelming.)<br />Cost - 5 (In the store where I shop, Starbucks coffee costs close to $9 for a package, unless you get it on sale...so the Amazon cost seems reasonable. Especially if you consider you are getting 2 packages for a little over the cost of 1. And it's cheaper if you spend between $3 and $4 for a cup of coffee in Starbucks, while buying a bag gets you at least 30.)<br />Smell - 4 (When you open the package, you can smell the faint smell of Vanilla and even see some vanilla beans in the grounds. While brewing you do get the faint aroma of vanilla.)<br /><br />The only thing that I am not sure of was my use of vanilla creamer. While I really enjoy the taste of my regular house/breakfast blend with a splash of vanilla creamer (I don't have to add sugar), it seemed that my normal splash of vanilla creamer did not complement the vanilla already in the coffee. I think it is better with a regular half & half, than a flavored creamer. Otherwise, I think this coffee is a wonderful alternative to regular coffee.

review/summary: Where's the vanilla?
review/text: I love Starbucks coffee.  I stop twice a week on my way to work for an espresso or just a cup of coffee, and I have Starbucks Via instant coffee at work for the other days.  I do like the occasional flavored coffee as well, and, when in season, get the Starbucks gingerbread or egg nog lattes, or have the Starbucks Via Cinnamon instant coffee.  So it was that I had high hopes for Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee.  The coffee had a strong, lovely vanilla aroma upon opening the bag of ground coffee.  I quickly prepared myself a cup and sat down with much anticipation at enjoying some wonderful coffee.  Well... it's coffee.  I guess that's about all I can say about it.  The actual coffee part of the 'taste experience' seemed humdrum.  Starbucks is known for robust coffees, but this was lackluster at best.  And while the vanilla scent was strong upon opening the package, the vanilla flavor is all but dissipated upon brewing.  There is a hint of vanilla flavor upon drinking, but it's not enough in my opinion.  I can smell it more than I can taste it by quite a bit.<br /><br />Perhaps some of the 'infusion' was lost due to the coffee being already ground when bagged, which I've heard causes the coffee to lose some of its flavor very quickly, but can't state that for a fact since I buy only whole beans and grind them myself (this product wasn't available in whole bean to try).  Overall, I was disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone who likes some body and rich flavor to their coffee or likes a distinctly flavored coffee, and I won't be buying it in future.

review/text: There is no question about the fact that I absolutely love a rich and full-body flavored cup of coffee. The aroma can always get to me through a single whiff for me to enjoy. But when it does come to the best, you really expect to the best company to have the best flavor. That does come mostly well with Starbucks, and their brand of Natural Fusions Vanilla flavored coffee. The taste does fell delightful, but honestly I was hoping from the smell that there could've been a lot more vanilla flavored into the coffee, making more savory cup deliver the best vanilla you could ask for. While it isn't a bad cup from Starbucks at all, I have definitely tasted better from brands like Melitta and Folgers. Still, I wish I could've gotten more Starbucks than my money had shown for it.<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Taste: B-<br /><br />Overall: C+

review/summary: Vanilla and Coffee, excellent combination. But Starbucks burnt flavor is overpowering.
review/text: This coffee smells fabulous. Brew a cup and the whole house smells great. Vanilla and coffee together is a match made in heaven. Allow a small piece of dark chocolate to melt in your mouth with this coffee, and that is even better. I just didn't care for the Starbucks burnt bean flavor.<br /><br />If you love the Starbucks burnt roast flavor of their coffee, it is possible that you will love this coffee. The vanilla flavor is clearly present at exactly the right level, not so overbearing that the coffee tastes like vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />Be forewarned, this is not a shot of vanilla sugar syrup for your coffee. Nor is it a Mini-Moo French Vanilla cream addition. The flavor is one of coffee, pure very dark roasted Starbucks coffee, and vanilla, no sweetness or milk flavor.<br /><br />The package directions, 2 tablespoons of coffee per six ounce cup is extremely strong, especially if made in a French press. I love espresso, am addicted to Nespresso (three each morning), really strong coffee in France and Italy, and Turkish coffee without sugar. I drink all coffee black. So I am not afraid of a strong coffee. The problem for me, Starbucks burns their beans, and it imparts a flavor that I just don't enjoy. Clearly a bazillion people disagree with me. However, these directions made coffee that was just way too strong. It might be fine in a drip coffee maker, but certainly not a French Press with water at exactly 180 degrees.

review/text: Being a major Starbucks fan and lover of vanilla, I couldn't pass up the chance to try the Vanilla flavored coffee. I expected the coffee to just have a hint of vanilla to it like most flavored (unsweetened) coffees do. I was, therefor, surprised when I took the first sip of this delicious coffee. Following the directions to the letter, I brewed a full-bodied excellent cup of vanilla flavored coffee. Way to go Starbucks! Adding a little sweetener and creamer to your coffee makes it taste like a vanilla latte. You can jump up the flavor with a shot of flavored syrup or creamer. My son added cocoa to his cup and said it was like having a tuxedo. I would recommend serving this coffee to guests for the holidays. It fills the house with the soothing and warm scent of vanilla.

review/text: Although the vanilla & sarsaparilla flavor is best described as "subtle", this Starbucks coffee<br />must surely have the highest caffeine content of any coffee I've tried short of Espresso. Several<br />hours after I finished a normal-sized cup, I still felt wired! That, combined with the bold flavor<br />of the beans themselves, makes the Natural Fusions a brew not for the faint-hearted. It's also not<br />too highly priced compared to certain others, which makes it a very good buy of its type. You may<br />wish to start with a lesser amount than usual when trying this coffee for the first time, then<br />make adjustments according to your taste. If you are used to traditional supermarket coffee, this<br />Starbucks blend will blow you away. You can bring the empty bag to a Starbucks location to receive<br />a free 12-ouncer, which sweetens the deal. I recommend this blend, but new users are advised to<br />proceed with caution!

review/summary: Nice coffee...
review/text: Opened the pack, took a smell & found fresh coffee inside which smelled nice so I brewed my first pot. Poured a cup then tasted a few sips black. What I found was a light body somewhat like Starbuck's brand Breakfast Blend with a hint of vanilla flavor that wasn't too strong or overpowering with no off flavors of any kind. Great I thought, now to add the usual 2 spoons of sugar. Did that, took a sip & found the coffee to be pretty good with some vanilla flavor still there. To sum up it's a nice coffee that I'll enjoy drinking even though I'll admit that I prefer the darker roasts like French Roast, Sumatra & Italian Roast. Not quite a 5 star coffee but still good enough for drinking anytime during the morning, throughout the day or in the evening. Will be sharing some of this pack with two friends who like light body coffee's to see what they think of it. But as for myself I don't think I'll be buying this coffee very often, Maybe once or twice per year.<br /><br />Edit to post: This coffee seems to be weaker in the caffeine content than the Starbuck's darker roast coffee's. Not a complaint, just for your information if you like less caffeine in your coffee.

review/summary: Slightly better than other flavored coffees
review/text: Because your baseline tastes may well differ from mine, here's where I'm coming from: I'm not a fan of artificially flavored coffees, but I do like an occasional shake of cinnamon or cocoa in my coffee--and a pinch of cardamom is awesome. I do like Starbucks coffee--some people say it tastes burnt, though, or is over-roasted. I take my coffee black or with cream, and only occasionally add some Splenda -- I don't "do" sugar. I dislike the "Bailey's Irish Cream"/butter pecan/you name it -flavored-type coffees--they taste of artificial flavors to me, and the quality of the coffee isn't that good. So I set out to try the new Starbucks ground "naturally" flavored coffees...<br /><br />Well, this was rather disappointing. I know that "natural flavors" doesn't necessarily mean "natural vanilla flavor"-- all it means is that the flavorings are derived from plants and not petroleum--could well be from pine trees. This coffee lists in order the following ingredients: ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root. .... Now, we don't know what the "natural flavors" are, but they are something different from ground vanilla beans, and listed before them. The sarsaparilla root is kind of weird too-- sarsaparilla, the beverage, tastes like root beer! Well, this has that "artificially flavored coffee" taste--smells and tastes a lot like Bailey's Irish Cream flavored coffee, although the underlying coffee is much better than you might get from a supermarket brand of flavored coffee--it's Starbucks, after all.  I put Splenda in mine, as well as cream--not very pleasant on its own.<br /><br />On the plus side, you can control how sweet you make it, and use the sweetener you prefer--but why not just put a glug of natural vanilla extract or some ground vanilla beans in your regular coffee yourself? That way your coffee maker doesn't get all flavored up, either.<br /><br />and--it's not the 3/4 lb. (12 oz)  bag you might have become accustomed to (remember when all coffee came in a full pound bag?) --it's only 11 oz!! I guess they think we aren't paying attention.

review/summary: I don't love it
review/text: I'm not a huge fan of Starbucks regular coffees, although I admit to buying their specialty drinks (like the pumpkin spice latte). I tend to think their coffee is too strong and a little bitter. I thought the vanilla would be smoother, and if brewing it myself, I could keep it from being too strong. When I opened the pouch, the vanilla smell was definitely there, and I thought this would be smooth, delicious coffee. After brewing a pot, I really couldn't taste the vanilla at all, and the coffee tastes just like the usual Starbucks fare -- strong and a little bitter. I sweetened it, I put some milk in it -- still not very pleasant. If you like Starbucks coffee, you'll probably like this, but don't expect to get the vanilla flavor.

review/text: I like to add a little flavoring to my Columbian coffee, but I don't like anything overpowering. I have been using this for about a week and am very happy with this product.<br /><br />I grind my own Columbian beans and then add a spoonful of Starbucks Vanilla Flavored Coffee to the ground beans. The result is a great tasting coffee with just a hint of flavor. I love it, and have gotten compliments. It will last a long time if you use this method.

review/summary: Delicious but expensive
review/text: We really liked this coffee - it smells great and the taste is rich, intense, smooth and delicious. Brewing instructions state that two rounded tablespoons should be used per cup which is way too much unless you want to grow hair on your chest. Another tip - some reviewers have mentioned bitterness - a pinch of kosher salt added to the coffee grounds which counteracts bitterness. After drinking this, I'm looking forward to trying the caramel flavor. However, the price of this small 11 oz. bag is way too expensive and I can find equally good coffee for half this price at my local market.

review/summary: Disappointing - Not a Premium Roast
review/text: This Thanksgiving evening, four of us tried the Starbucks Vanilla Roast. All of us were disappointed. Comments included: 'bitter', 'too acidic', 'flat', 'vanilla smell overcomes the coffee aroma'. When drinking the vanilla roast, the bitterness outweighs the coffee taste and the vanilla is all but invisible. Most coffees are average and this one is no different. It is no star when it comes to the coffee field. If you are a serious coffee connoisseur or would like to find out more about great coffee, you will be best served by investigating premium roasts available from other (often less mainstream) roasters.

review/summary: Pleasant flavor
review/text: As soon as I received Starbuck's Natural Fusions Vanilla flavored coffee, I brewed up a few cups.  This is conveniently packaged, since one can scoop out what one wants, and re-seal the package for the refrigerator.<br /><br />I use a Chemex coffee maker because it's all glass, and uses a quality laboratory-quality filter, so off-flavors are minimized.  This lets the coffee flavor shine through.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor is apparent from the time one opens the package, with the wonderful smell of vanilla wafting up to your nose.  Brewing it is a breeze; it's got a good blend size that permits the Chemex to function very well, and percolate through the coffee quickly.<br /><br />The flavor and taste of coffee is why we drink it.  And here the Starbucks comes through fine.  But beware; this is not overly cloying flavor masking the taste of the coffee; instead, the vanilla flavor adds to the coffee taste, rather than overwhelming it, as you can get in those 'international flavor' instant coffees.<br /><br />Recommended.  This is a full-flavored coffee, perhaps even more on the dark-roasted side (at least that was the flavor to me).  I'm more of a fan of the regular roast, so it was a bit heavy for me.  Even so, it was a nice cup of coffee.  And if one is a full-bodied roast fan, this would be very, very good.  Four stars for the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Coffee.

review/summary: I like vanilla, but this is pretty intense
review/text: This is ground Starbucks Arabica coffee, which has been infused with intense vanilla flavoring.  My first impression was the aroma of the coffee upon opening the package - very nice vanilla aroma, but strong. When I made my first pot of coffee I used the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla alone.  For me, this was a mistake.  WAY too sweet, and I like vanilla flavored creamer in my coffee, but used plain half n' half for this one and it still tasted too sweet to me.<br /><br />The second pot I chose to mix this coffee (50/50) with a Kona blend from the local market.  My husband still thought the blend to be too sweet, but I liked it.  I guess the bonus here would be that if you like a more subtle, less sweet vanilla flavoring to your coffee the package will last you that much longer when you blend it with something non-flavored!<br /><br />I give it a 3-star rating because to me, it's just OK.  I can't say I like it, but I don't dislike it either.<br /><br />The packaging says 'an accent of vanilla' and 'an understated vanilla highlight'.  I'd beg to differ.  I'd say something like infused with a 'strong vanilla overtone'.  The ground coffee contains ground vanilla beans and Indian sarsaparilla root.<br /><br />Maybe it's the root that does it?  Whatever it is, be prepared to enjoy this arabica coffee only if you really enjoy sweet, intense vanilla flavor.

review/summary: Brew it cold!
review/text: Okay, here's the deal.  I make salad dressing from scratch.  I get out a nice, green fruity extra virgin olive oil and spices and some decent white or red wine vinegar, and make something entirely superior to, while still generally cheaper than, those supermarket blends of indifferent grade spices and chemical thickeners, swimming in mostly-canola oil.<br /><br />And why the heck am I talking salad dressing in a coffee review?<br /><br />I make coffee, I tend towards the similarly purist.  Whole bean.  You can get a basic grinder model for the price of a pound or two of the beans, and pre-ground is pre-staled, under the best of circumstances.  As for flavoring?  Flavoring is something I've long believed was invented by coffee brokers to get the lower grade stuff off their shelves.  And those flavors are generally lab-created, both for economy and for more precise/consistent control of the product.<br /><br />So I obviously come to this coffee with my biases, but I also love Starbucks coffees, bought whole from a Starbucks storefront.  I do notice a quality difference right away with the supermarket blends - I think in their own stores, the beans just turn over faster.<br /><br />Yet, as it happens, Starbucks Natural Fusion Vanilla coffee has (for me) a few advantages - chiefly, natural flavoring.  In this case, vanilla, and sasparilla, long a favorite ingredient of old-fashioned carbonated beverages.<br /><br />Brewed my first cup in my coffee maker.  And I hated it.  Very odd, unpleasant, cloying, bad, chemical taste.  Any vanilla taste or aroma, stayed behind in the bag.  Now, other reviewers clearly, have loved it.  Did I get a bad batch?  (This happens.  What one reviewer says about one bag has to be taken as one data point only.)<br /><br />Unwilling to give up on a perfectly, well, full bag, I decided to try cold brewing.  You can buy a fancy appliance (Amazon here carries no less than 4 systems for the purpose), or you can acquire a largish (6" or so) fine mesh strainer and a quart jar.  Stir together � lb of ground coffee with 4.5 cups cold water, and refrigerate overnight.  Strain the next day, and the resulting concentrate stays fresh tasting for a week or 2.  You'll need to add water in a 3 to 1 or 4 to 1 ratio, with the "1" being the concentrate.<br /><br />The cold brewing technique has its pros and cons.  Pro:  it's really convenient to make a week's worth of concentrate, as most of the "work" is just giving it the time to steep.  For the acid sensitive or just those who just prefer a smoother brew, it is a miracle.  But for the "Con": the real nuance and complexity of some of the best coffees comes along with the coffee oils that release under HEAT, and I do notice some flavor loss with some of my favorite coffees, cold brewed.<br /><br />Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla was made for cold brewing.  The delicate essence of non-lab created flavors held up much better un-"cooked".  I tasted vanilla, and yes, even the sasparilla, which people tend to know from Root Beer.  The off notes were still there in the background but more carbonated-soda reminiscent than they were harsh or offensive.  And yes, this is darning with faint praise, but...<br /><br />I'd buy this.  If I had a group to caffeinate for a hot summer event, and minimal time to futz with grinders or syrups or vanilla beans or cooling and icing hot coffee, this would be the trick.<br /><br />For home use...sorry.  Whole beans.  An extra 30 seconds of effort for 10 times more taste, and maybe a dollop of the Torani syrup, if my heart is set on flavoring.<br /><br />So, Starbucks, if you can "infuse" a whole bean with all natural flavors, I'd love to hear about it.  Maybe you could just sell the beans with a bottle of ground vanilla/cinnamon/nutmeg/whatever powder like you have in your stores - low tech, but lovely.  In the meantime, 3 stars for a catering/get-together blend that is admittedly worlds better than you average foodservice pre-ground.<br /><br />Just brew it cold.

review/summary: understated, natural-flavored coffee
review/text: I have a bad image of flavored coffees because, so often, tons of artificial flavor is used to cover up bad coffee and sell it as "premium".  This coffee is better than that.<br /><br />This Starbucks Natural Fusions (Vanilla) is decent coffee, with a modest amount of natural vanilla and sarsaparilla flavor added.  The result is more balanced and drinkable.<br /><br />- The grind: not as uniform as some pre-ground brands (Melitta).  It left considerable dust on my hands.  Minus one star.<br /><br />- Freshness: no noticeable staleness.  Smells good but not as sweet as freshly roasted coffee, of course.<br /><br />- Packaging:  Easy to open, easy to reclose.  Was shipped with minimal air space.<br /><br />Verdict: The best pre-ground, flavored coffee I've tried, only loses a star for a non-uniform grind.  It just tastes good, and I'm not a big flavored coffee fan.

review/summary: Good, just not...really good
review/text: I'm not any kind of coffee snob since I usually kill it with creamer anyway, but I do love my flavored coffee, vanilla expecially.  I've had some mixed results with Starbucks coffee, generally preferring their plain roasts, but I've never tried Fusions.  I think I'd rather stick to another brand for my flavored.<br /><br />The bag itself was a lot different from nearly any bag of coffee I'd ever purchased pre-packaged.  It was sealed, but not vaccum-packed, and the loose grounds only filled about 2/3s of the bag.  This isn't a brick.  It also was extremely easy to open, which was nice for my fingers, but considering what I usually end up wrestling with in other mail-order coffees, I wonder if the other stuff was unnecessarily difficult or if this was just packed the right way.<br /><br />The grounds had very mild vanilla scent, nothing like the beans you grind in the stores or even inexpensive stuff you buy in cans.  It didn't get any stronger when I brewed it.  I was afraid I hadn't used enough grounds, since I hadn't used the recommended amount (it was double what I use with my usual grounds), so I made another pot and had the same results.  While the second pot tasted better overall, it wasn't really any more "vanilla" than the first and it still had a little bit of a medicinal flavor to it.<br /><br />My recommendation if you really want a good aromatic vanilla flavor would be to stick to another brand coffee; Millstone and Melitta make good versions if you want to go the fancier route and if you're lucky and live in the area or can get it mailed to you, Steep and Brew is the best I've ever had.  Honestly, the various kinds of Folgers vanilla give better taste bang than this.

review/text: Just so you know where I'm coming from:  I find most Starbucks Coffee to be a bit strong for my tastes, and I prefer flavored coffees (the horror!), like hazelnut or vanilla.  So I was very curious to try this new blend from Starbucks.<br /><br />I quite like it.  It's definitely stronger than the stuff I'm used to, although Starbucks diehards will probably find it a bit weaker than they prefer.  It doesn't have an overbearing vanilla taste; it's more of a hint than a strongly defined flavor.  I drink my coffee black, and there is a nice complexity of flavors that comes through.<br /><br />All in all, this is a nice, somewhat strong coffee with a hint of vanilla aroma.  It'd be a nice after-dinner coffee, with the hint of vanilla complimenting dessert.  Best of all, it splits the difference between heavy-duty coffee drinkers like my husband and more wussy coffee drinkers like myself.  With this blend, we could brew one pot of coffee and each drink it happily.

review/text: If you are a fan of vanilla, which I am, this is a fine tasting coffee with a nice overlay of flavor to the usual Starbucks roast. The grounds have a rich, nutty aroma and it brew up nicely. My only issue is that even with its fancy name, it still tastes like an added flavor and not "infused" with the beans themselves. To me, it tastes very similar to products from other big American brands -- suitable for most general purposes but for a truly exceptional cup of coffee you'll have to pony up a little more.

review/summary: Very Rich and Dark
review/text: Every Starbucks coffee I've ever tried brews up so strong and dark that I always have to reduce the amount of coffee from what the directions recommend (usually by as much as half.) This flavorful, rich coffee is no different in that respect. First off, I must admit that I really don't care much for flavored coffees as I prefer actual coffee-flavored coffee. I also use a standard, automatic-drip machine (think Mr. Coffee), so I guess I'm not expert. But I do drink coffee daily and I love a good cup of rich, smooth coffee with a little real cream added. If you like your coffee VERY strong, brew this one according to package directions. I brewed it with half of the recommended amount and mixed in some Folger's decaf to round it out. You may be surprised to know that the result was a still-very-strong coffee (that some folks in my house wanted to dilute with water) that was smooth and tasty with just the right touch of vanilla. My husband drank it black and said it was "fine" but his only requirement of coffee is that it be strong, so this fit the bill. I added my usual cream and a distinctly unusual half-teaspoon of sugar. The result was a delicious, smooth, creamy coffee with a kick of sweet vanilla. Although I'm still no big fan of sweet or flavored coffee, I give this a big thumbs-up for taste. Since the holidays are approaching, I can see our family drinking this with dessert (or even as dessert after some turkey and dressing), and I also am considering picking up a few bags as holiday gifts. If you like Starbucks coffee this may be one you'd like to try.

review/summary: good, not great, flavor
review/text: I've tried three different flavors of Starbucks "Natural Fusions" coffee so far.  Even though I love cinnamon and sometimes add some ground cinnamon to my coffee grounds to flavor regular coffee, I didn't much care for the flavor of Starbucks cinnamon flavored coffee.  This vanilla flavor is pretty good, however, though I will say that I don't like it enough to buy it again.  The real winner of the three is the caramel flavor.  While drinking it won't make you think you're eating a caramel candy, it does have a very pleasing flavor whether consumed hot or cold.  That's the only flavor of the three that I have purchased repeatedly and will purchase again.<br /><br />As for the underlying coffee flavor of this particular flavor, I think it suffices to say that it tastes like a medium roasted Starbucks coffee.  I happen to like Starbucks' coffee beans, but I know some people don't care for the brand.  If you're a fan of Starbucks, this roast/flavor is consistent with what you've come to expect from them.

review/text: I'm a Starbucks junkie.  I need my daily soy latte.  But I've never been a fan of their coffee.  I've tried a couple different brews and thought they had a strange, bitter after taste.  I think their coffee is undrinkable black.  I've tried to add sugar, cream, milk, half and half in different combinations and it just didn't taste good to me so I stopped wasting my money.  But since this was free through Vine, I thought I would try this one to see if it was more of the same and was pleasantly surprised.  Instead of the recommended 2 TBS for every 6 ounces of water, I just use one heaping tablespoon, which may have toned it down a bit.  Because the vanilla is infused, it gives a subtle sweetness to the coffee but doesn't overpower it.  All I needed was a little milk to top it off!<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it's good but not my favorite.

review/summary: Especially good for those who like their coffee black
review/text: Very good tasting slightly infused coffee with real vanilla. This is very good for those who drink black coffee or even those who take regular non-sweetened creamer. Also, try the caramel one too, as that is tasty as well.

review/summary: Good flavor that's not too strong
review/text: I love coffee and if it's Starbucks I love it even more.  This ground coffee is not too strong and has a nice vanilla taste.  Since it's ground, I used it up pretty quickly.  My guests liked it too so I'm chaulking this up as very paletable.

review/summary: A very good cup of coffee
review/text: I still prefer grinding my own whole bean coffee, but for a pre-ground, flavored coffee, this is probably the best I have had. The vanilla flavor is just right, not too over powering like many flavored coffees. Instead it has just the right level of vanilla. The only issue is that you do NOT need the amount of coffee that is suggested, you can probably get by with half of the amount of coffee and still enjoy a great cup of joe!

review/summary: A Great Cup of Coffee
review/text: NOTE: This is a VINE review.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect from this bag of "Natural Fusions Vanilla" coffee from Starbucks.  Here's what I got: The coffee out of the bag smells and looks great. The ground beans have a medium to fine consistency.  Two thumbs up so far.<br /><br />I brewed a few cups with filtered water and the excellent aroma exploded.  The aroma gets a 10 out of 10 in my book.  The coffee in the mug also has a nice color and texture (brewed strong with filtered water it is medium-bodied).<br /><br />The overall taste of the coffee is also very good.  The vanilla is sort of "behind" the coffee, so it doesn't jump out at you but you know it is there.  I've had other vanilla coffees in which the vanilla overpowers everything; the Starbucks vanilla doesn't do that at all.  I like that.  Along with the vanilla, there may be some hints of butter and cinnamon in the cup.  The expert taster might even notice the trace of sasparilla root hiding in there.  As far as acidity goes, the cup is more soft and sweet than sour and acidic (in my opinion).<br /><br />I was also surprised that this cup does not have the typical burnt (after)tastes that some Starbucks coffee has - there is no murky/dirty lingering flavor.  The cup is pleasant from start to finish.<br /><br />All in all, I was nicely surprised by this cup of coffee and do recommend it.

review/summary: Very nice aroma, but lacking a bit in vanilla flavour
review/text: I like Starbucks. My partner does not much care for them. So you get both sides of the spectrum in this review.<br /><br />On opening the bag (which didn't seem to be vacuum packed ??) the coffee smells slightly of vanilla and you can see little bits of bean (or something non-coffee) in the mix. While brewing I have to say I didn't smell much, but when the coffee is poured into the cup there is a nicely subtly hint of vanilla aroma. (Nothing like the Folger's we often buy, because...hey! We are cheap).<br /><br />My partner says: it's ok. It almost tastes like someone put vanilla extract in the pot because there is an almost alcoholy aftertaste to the brew.<br /><br />I get almost no vanilla flavour, but the scent is pleasant. It tastes like regular Starbucks coffee which is to say slightly more bitter than grocery brands and more drying to the tongue with a nice roasted aftertaste.<br /><br />At $6.50 (if you buy enough to get free shipping) a bag this is OK, but you might find it cheaper (if you like it) at your grocery. They just got it at our local store & it is on sale for about the same price. We liked the Melitta coffee we tried better...and--well to be honest the Folger's Gourmet has a lot more flavour.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: There is a distinct vanilla flavor in this coffee for sure. It's strong in taste like a lot of Starbucks blends, plus I love the smell (my cat is afraid of the smell for some reason -- actually runs away from the open bag and he's generally a sniffer).<br /><br />Ingredient list on the bag:<br />ground coffee<br />natural flavor (w/ corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin)<br />ground vanilla beans<br />Indian sarsaparilla root<br /><br />The bag also says that it's 100% responsibly grown and ethically traded, but I don't see the actual words "fair trade" on it so I'm not sure what that means.<br /><br />Would I buy it at $13 for 22 ounces (2 11oz bags)? Probably not, but I'm cheap; I don't even go to their stores. But I think Starbucks fans will think it's worth it.

review/summary: Not much bang for your buck
review/text: As stated on the packaging, this vanilla flavored coffee by Starbucks has a "subtle flavor and an indulgent aroma".  So much so, in fact, that brewing the coffee is a more satisfying experience than drinking it.<br /><br />Going off of the recommended 2 Tbsp of coffee for every 6 oz. of water, I found the brew diluted and weak-willed.  Stepping up the dosage does deliver a more powerful vanilla taste, but you'll find yourself plowing through the 11 oz. bag at a much quicker rate.<br /><br />All told, if a light, mild vanilla brew is what you're after, this offering by Starbucks will suit you.  If, however, you're after a more potent brew, you would likely get more bang for your buck with a less "subtle flavor."

review/summary: Smooth taste
review/text: I usually shy away from Starbucks because the regular (house blend) tall coffee tends to make me jittery. But I brewed this at the office and boy was it a hit! The aroma permeated the entire hallway that my coworkers on the floor below us came upstairs for a cup. I liked that it was smooth and fragrant, however, you could still taste the coffee.

review/summary: Very good for a flavored coffee
review/text: Most flavored coffees have an underlying artificial taste, but surprisingly I could not detect any off notes to this Starbucks vanilla flavored coffee.  It had a natural taste of vanilla combined with that smooth taste that I associate with Starbucks coffee.  I would recommend this product line to those who want to try a good flavored coffee.

review/summary: Decent-tasting coffee with subtle vanilla flavor
review/text: Although Starbucks isn't my favorite brand of coffee to use at home (that distinction goes to Godiva Breakfast Blend), I do like experimenting with different flavored coffees, and so I was interested in trying this new offering from Starbucks.<br /><br />The coffee itself is reminiscent of a light-to-medium roast.  The vanilla flavor is a nice addition, but it is VERY subtle.  I made this coffee in both my drip coffee maker and my french press, and surprisingly, I found that the vanilla was more detectable in the former (usually the french press provides a more pronounced flavor).  There was a decent vanilla aroma to the coffee as well--not enough to fill the house, but noticeable in the individual mug.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would recommend this coffee to those who enjoy the Starbucks brand and prefer flavorings that do not overpower the overall coffee taste.

review/summary: Wake Up to Vanilla Coffee
review/text: Usually flavored coffee is made by masking low quality ground beans with artificial flavors, and usually Starbucks roast their beans to oblivion, eliminating any subtle flavors, leaving a harsh, bitter product.  Fortunately, neither is the case here.  The beans are mildly roasted, giving a flavorful, satisfying brew.  The flavor is a complementary vanilla that blends well with the coffee.  Not a cloying, overwhelming flavor that is too common with flavored coffees.  If you want your coffee to be robust, not bitter, with a mild vanilla flavor, this is for you.

review/summary: Very light vanilla overnote added to a good coffee
review/text: The good thing here is that they didn't overdo the vanilla flavor, easy to do with the standard vanilla flavoring, (artificial) vanillin. Instead they used real vanilla beans and obtained a more subtle taste which goes nicely with the full-bodied, mildly bitter Arabica beans. If you want lots o' vanilla flavor, this ain't for you. But if you want a subtle top note of real vanilla, you'll enjoy this one.

review/summary: A better tasting flavored coffee
review/text: I am bit of a coffee fanatic, so I am always looking for new and exotic types of brew to indulge in.  This coffee by Starbucks is a vanilla flavored concoction.  Flavor coffees, I have found, are usually hit or miss, in my experience more miss.  However, in the case of this coffee I found the vanilla flavor to be rather subtle.<br /><br />This coffee is not a dark and/or strong blend; it is rather mild so the discreet hints of vanilla give this beverage a smooth taste.  I used flavored creamer when I drank this coffee. My first cup I used hazelnut and my second cup I used pumpkin spice.  I found the hints of vanilla gleamed out rather nice with both of these flavor creams.  I haven't used it with basic cream, but I am sure the taste would still be pleasant.  I think anyone who really enjoys coffee should at least allow their mug to associate with this Starbuck blend at least once.

review/summary: Delightful!
review/text: I am very happy with the flavor of this coffee! I make my coffee using one scoop per two cups of cold water and that makes a nice moderately dark coffee. I usually add a little dollop of creamy caramel macchiato which brings out the smooth, sweet vanilla taste and decreases any bitterness of the blend. The aroma is enticing and I can't wait to have my first cup of it in the morning -- I think it's a great "wake up" coffee. I realize that some people do not care for flavored coffees but this one has a very delicate vanilla taste and I'd recommend it very highly as it's not overpowering.<br /><br />Preference and taste are quite subjective, however, and it might not be for everyone but I sure like it and will likely purchase it again.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This is an interesting coffee.  The beans are a dark roast with a bold, rich flavor, and the vanilla adds a nice layer of sweetness.  No real bitterness, which is rare in a dark roast, but it does have that little bite that seems characteristic of Starbucks' coffees in general. Overall, it's a smooth, good cup of coffee.<br /><br />Pay attention to the side of the bag. You can trade in the empty for a free cup of coffee at a participating Starbucks.

review/summary: So Vanilla-licous
review/text: I love the smell of this coffee. Okay, I love the smell of coffee, period. But, this... this is so warm and inviting right from opening the bag.<br />If the smell is a promise, the taste is where it delivers. It is as delicious as the scent, smooth but with a very slight vanilla flavor.  Just enough to take a bit of the famous 'Starbucks bitter' edge off, but not too much to overwhelm.<br />I would happily purchase this again!

review/summary: Maybe I'm not qualified to review coffee...
review/text: First off, historically I have never liked Starbucks coffee at all.  To me it has always tasted burned or smokey.  Second, I always drink my coffee with some sort of flavored cream such as hazelnut, French vanilla - the products sold in the dairy counter in you local food emporium.<br /><br />That said, I really liked this Starbucks coffee.  It did not have the burned taste at all (I did taste it before adding my additives.)  I couldn't quite get the vanilla bean flavor, but I didn't try very much of the pure black brew.<br /><br />With my International Delight Caramel Macchiato it was quite good, and definitely better than my standard Folgers Extra Dark.

review/summary: MY FIRST TASTE OF STARBUCKS COFFEE :)
review/text: My town doesn't have a Starbucks so this was my first taste. I must say it has the best brewing aroma of any coffee I have tried so far. The taste was mellow and pleasant. The vanilla is not to strong like some can be. I was very happy that they use fair trade so that the coffee growers get a fair price and the the farming methods are earth friendly.<br /><br />Another perk is when the bag is empty you can take it to a Starbucks and get a free 12 oz brewed coffee. It has to be redeemed within 30 days of the best buy date on the package.<br /><br />It's good coffee. Not a lot of fluff to say about coffee. Give it a try!
