review/summary: Just in case you were wondering  . . .
review/text: Just in case you were wondering about the "extra peppermint" that was so important it needed to be added as a selling point - it is no more than a single mint like you get in a restaurant with your check. Really pathetic marketing ploy.<br /><br />Starbuck's K-Cups are way too expensive for what they taste like. Won't buy again and certainly not from this seller and its shameless tactics.

review/text: Do not buy from this seller if you are interested in quality.  As another reviewer said, the Peppermint is a cheesy after dinner mint, packaged in a label with a different business' (an apartment complex I believe) phone number on it.  The K cups I got had expiration dates which had already passed.  An finally, the k cups came in, wait for it, a paper lunch sack.

review/summary: Star Bucks K-Cups Breakfast Blend
review/text: We are Starbucks Coffee drinkers but the K-Cups are somewhat dissapointing, We have only tried Breaffast Blend as that is all that we normally drink. We have used about 4 boxes of these so far and they seem real strong and bitter tasting. Maybe we got a bad batch. I hope not we have 12 boxes with 12 in each box. When they first came out I got carried away on the orders. We have always used Breakfast Blend in the 20 oz bags and that seems OK. We will probably go back to the Green Mountain K-Cups They are a lot cheaper than the Starbucks and much better tasting. Anyone that wants to buy any Starbucks K cups contact me

review/summary: K-Cups are the Best
review/text: I've tried the Sumatra and French Roast and are hands down my favorite k-cups. I prefer a dark, robust flavor and these hit the mark better than any other brand I've tried - and I've tried just about all the dark roasts!<br /><br />This morning I tried the Pike's Place, a medium roast, and it was superb. not as strong as the dark roasts but still intense in flavor - and better than most other dark roast brands even though it is medium.<br /><br />Overall, just packed with flavor more so than other k-cups - and I do enjoy some of the other dark roasts too, but Starbucks simply nailed my personal taste.

review/summary: Starbucks "sampler"??
review/text: I received this order today and was very disappointed. I "assumed" way too much....assumed that a sampler would be a true sampling of the many flavors available by Starbucks. There are 3 different types in my BAG, which was not very professionally packaged. And the peppermint....I assumed it would be a peppermint coffee....it's a mint that you get for free from restaurants, hotels, etc. I learned a valuable lesson.....will not order from this person again.

review/summary: Works great in morning smoothies!
review/text: I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says "keeps best refrigerated or frozen," and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.

review/summary: My favorite brownie mix, for sure!
review/text: This is my favorite brownie mix out there.  This is a pretty good deal when it comes to brownie mixes online.  I sometimes try another online retailer but they are almost always out of stock.  It is nice to come on Amazon and find them in stock.  I would like the boxed mix because you get more mix and it will make a 9X13" pan but I make this work.  I use 2 pouches, which makes a thick 9X13" pan of brownies ("thick" meaning it is a little thicker than if you made the 9X13" pan with the Betty crocker box size).  I use the same directions on the back of the pouch as if I were making the 8X8" square pan (just using 2 pouches and the larger pan) and it seems to turn out just fine.<br /><br />I like the "fudge brownie" flavor.  The dark chocolate and the milk chocolate flavors of Betty Crocker brownie mix just don't seem as chocolatey.  I have tried Pillsbury, Duncan Heinz, and Ghiradelli and I like these brownies the best.  The flavor and consistency of the Betty Crocker Fudge Brownies are always the way I like it and they always seem to bake well (I sometimes have a problem with the Ghiradelli ones cooking since they are so thick, which is why I'm not the biggest fan).<br /><br />We live overseas and I had someone say that they wanted to learn my recipe for brownies.  I feel bad that I have to tell her to follow the back of the Betty Crocker box!

review/summary: I can't decide if the outhouse or my cozy toilet is the better place for this product.
review/text: After trying this for myself, I suspected that those high ratings were only illusions. My husband told me that company's consider these reviews as just another form of advertising and pay people to lie about a product's quality. I really can't imagine anyone thinking this product is drinkable, let alone, pleasurable. If you want a couple recommendations on decent tasting t-discs for your Tassimo machine, the Jacobs Latte Macchiato isn't bad if you add sugar. This morning though, I drank it after I tried the Voluptuoso and my mouth has a metallic taste to it. Not sure which one is responsible. Another thing, the milk in the disc tastes sour, but when you add sugar, there is a decent flavor there. For the 2nd decent beverage, you can take the Kenco Crema with some Coffee Mate's Spiced Pumpkin and Vanilla Spiced Chai (a liberal amount) creamers, with enough sugar, and have a nice smooth cappaccino. I've tried about nine flavors now, and the coffee, cremas, most lattes and cappaccinos, have the same inferior quality in looks and taste, as a cheap instant coffee, as well as, having your mouth taste like you just drank the contents of an ashtray. Kenco Crema is the only one that did not taste like nicotene. These are the coffees I've tried: Gevailia Cappaccino, Maxwell House - House Blend, Hag Crema Decaf, Jacobs Kronung, Carte Noire Voluptuoso Classic, Kenco Crema and Jacob's Macchiato. After finding one inferior brew after another, I've given up looking for a good cup of black coffee and/or cappaccino, for the Tassimo. Don't do what I did, which was believe all the positive reviews and downplay the critical reviews. My curiousity has been appeased after spending $34 in Tassimo beverages. Thankfully, 2 packages were free. Now I can either spend more money in S&H to return them, or drink all 56 cigarettes...coffee I mean. Oh by the way, for a tasty hot chocolate beverage, try Celestial Seasonings "Tuscanny" 1 bag made strong, followed by 2 pkgs Carnation Instant Hot Chocolate, with mini marshmellows, and hot water in a tall to-go insulated mug. Amazon sells both, but you can get the chocolate mix on sale for about $1.50 in a grocer.

Huge advantages are that they fit nicely into back packs, no spoon requirement, one had eating action, and a great quick snack. If they can put more stuff into travel pack like this, I would eat and drink everything from pouches. One complaint is the packaging. They waste way too much packing material for the bulk box. It's 4 pouches inside a card board box, then 12 of those boxes in another box. I don't plan of selling these goodies so I can do without the extra packaging. Go cheap on the extra cardboard and pass the savings on to the customers.

review/summary: great snack
review/text: My girls (6 and 4) were not excited to see similar products if they had Elmo or other 'little kid' images on them, as they automatically thought it was baby food - and seeing that my two divas are anything but 'big girls', I was happy to see the package was big-kid friendly. In any case, this apple sauce is delicious and nutritious. We have tried all flavours by now and LOVE the cinnamon one (followed by strawberry, peach, banana, 'plain' apple).

review/summary: Great product, great price
review/text: I was very happy to find these on Amazon, since I love having the baby food pouches for my daughter when we are out and about, and the ones you can buy at Target (the best in-store price I've found) are significantly more expensive. At 8 months old, she's been able to hold it and feed herself for quite a while already...making it that much easier to use. It's a great way to contain the mess that carrying normal baby food around can bring. We don't use these all the time, but when we need them they're great to have.<br />As a sidenote, I make all my other baby food, and would absolutely love if someone would come out with a refillable pouch so you could reuse instead of buying new each time...

review/summary: Could not live without them!
review/text: I originally bought the applesauce crushers from Trader Joes and my son loved them. Decided to look on Amazon to get a better price and found these little gems. What I wanted was no sugar added applesauce pouches and these are the best price and love that they have plain and cinnamon (in addition to the other flavors) We have them in all our diaper bags and cars for emergencies. My son loves them so much sometime he will eat 5 in a row! I'm not a huge fan of applesauce but have tried them and they are really good. Even though they do contain natural sugar I still feel good that my son is getting his fruit! I actually just started feeding them to my 6 month old daughter with a spoon and she loves them too! I wish they were organic but that is the only thing I would change.

Simply unscrew the cap and enjoy the applesauce!  The only negative is the cap.  My 10 year old has a difficult time unscrewing the cap because it's a small diameter cap that has the safety-seal prongs you have to break.  On and the applesauce tastes good, too

review/summary: We are all addicted to these!
review/text: My toddler, my 8 year old, and myself can't get enough of these yummy snacks.  I only wish they came in varieties with a little more nutrition, like some added mango or carrot or blueberry, or perhaps vitamin fortified, but that's ok.  This is a healthy snack that feels like a treat because it's fun to eat, and they are especially nice cold from the fridge on a hot day.  I take one wherever I go to keep the toddler happy.  He loves them, and when I pull a "fwoot" out of my bag it magically wards off tantrums in the bank or grocery store.  My daughter just had strep throat and liked eating these when nothing else sounded good.  And when I get a sweets craving, sometimes I have one of these first (50 calories, no added sugar) and that often takes care of it.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: loved by whole family, except one!
review/text: My 5 year old loves these.  She would eat 3 pouches at a time if I let her!  My husband and I also like them (although I much prefer the apple-peach to the apple-cinnamon).  My 2.5 year old, however, just gags on these and spits it out.  I'm not quite sure what her problem is, because she does eat normal applesauce out of a bowl, but she really doesn't like these at all.  I think part of her problem is that she is expecting a different texture - this is much smoother in texture than applesauce from a jar.<br /><br />Despite her dislike we will continue to order these (amazon price is way better than our local store).

review/summary: Like the product, but arrived with only 2 months before expiration
review/text: Amazon did not like my first review so I will pull some punches this time (but leaving this as 2 stars).  I ordered these with another grocery item which had less than 4 months before expiration (vs 6 months typically for that item in store).  The Go Go Squeeze pack which I received had only 2 months left before it expires (expiration 7/21/12 and today is 5/7/2012).  These typically have about 9 or more months of shelf life in store.  I also noticed a slight plastic taste/smell when I tried one which I suspect comes from sitting longer on the shelf.  I noticed this much more faintly on the ones I purchased in store which were good for another 9 months.  I am overall not really happy that I purchased these from Amazon, from now on I will be buying them locally.<br /><br />The two stars are for the handiness of the product.  They are just OK as applesauce and kind'a small for an adult at 3.2oz, but they can't be beat for pack-ability.  I am also not a real big fan of the plastic smell/taste that I notice when opening the product.  It does say on the package that it is BPA free, though it does not say what the packaging is.

review/text: I bought these bars for several years at my local co-operative grocery store, and ate them daily--they are tasty. However, the price increased nearly 100% during that time, and I noticed that, although the individual wrappers within the box remained the same size, the bar within the wrapper decreased. When I stopped buying these, the actual bar was only half the size of the wrapper. That's deceptive packaging, so I refuse to buy these any more. I suspect that other shoppers likewise complained, because last month the store where I bought these stopped carrying them.

review/text: While slightly high in carbs (29g)low in sodium (85mg)and 150 calories per bar,this is not a weight loss product nor does it pretend to be.The texture of the pastry is light(with the fruit inside)and filling and as these things go, fairly healthy.The sugars show 15g per bar but it is fruit sugar and naturally delivered.The taste is excellent and again as these go, hard to stop with just ONE.But plaudits to Barbaras Bakery for a fine breakfast product or just as a snack.

review/text: These are my favorite brownies that you can make at home by far and are also better than anything you can buy at a grocery store! They have a great consistency and deep flavor! They are also very easy to make. If you add extra water to the icing mix, believe it or not, you can make an extremely rich, chocolatey drink similar to a Starbucks (don't go there often-rude service here in Atlanta and probably most places!) chocolate beverage that was served years ago. I don't put frosting on the brownies and just make a small serving of this rich "hot chocolate" when I am making them because the frosting mix is so similar to cocoa mix. I would never buy a different brand!

review/summary: I Should Have Never Tried It ... Too Late Now
review/text: I was wandering around the international food aisle when this caught my eye. Sweetened, condensed milk in a re-sealable bottle rather than a tin can. I said, "Oh my! What evil thing is this?" And then I bought it. You might not be able to use a whole can of sweetened, condensed milk, but you sure can find lots of uses for a it when it comes in a squeeze bottle. I put it in my coffee, in my tea, over my fruit, over my icecream, and then I lick the plate.<br /><br />The really nice thing about this container is that you can turn it upside down so that the nice, cool, sweet goo that is La Lechera is ready to pour whenever you want it.<br /><br />Don't buy this unless you want a new addiction.

review/summary: I should NEVER have purchased this product!
review/text: I purchased this product to make fudge with. I reasoned that I could make partial batches of specialty fudges by weighing out the sweetened condensed milk. WELL, the dispenser top on the container made this product just tooooooooo accessible. Reviewer "Paisleymonsoon" made it quite clear that this product had a sinister nature and that it could prove unholy to have it in your home. SO, I said to myself, "Self, you know you don't have an addictive personality, that is for weak people, and you've never been weak." Reviewer "Just Smile" also tried to warn potential buyers, but did I listen? NO! My husband is not into sweetened condensed milk (actually I have not asked him, I decided that I wanted, in this case, to assume) and I have not offered any to our pets either. You cannot share this with an animal that will eat anything, that would border on sacrilege. SO, since there is no one else to partake, and the lid bears a remarkable similarity to a delivery device, I have found that direct hits from a refrigerated bottle of it is as good as any a way to consume the mandatory amount necessary to sate my ferocious addiction. I suggest that sane, refined, civilized persons pass this product by, for the good of their own self-esteem, and for the good of their sane reputations. (NOTE: If they make the Fat Free version in these bottles instead of cans I will personally be in very big trouble!)

review/summary: Makes Vietnamese coffee so much easier!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Vietnamese iced coffee, but dealing with the cans of sweetened condensed milk was such a pain. It was harder to open, messy to pour, and more difficult to store. This stuff is so handy because it's in a plastic squeeze bottle. I don't really notice any taste difference between this and other brands - I guess I'm no connoisseur of sweetened condensed milk. The only thing I would really change would be to make the hole in the cap a little larger because if you keep this in the refrigerator, it can be a bit difficult to squeeze the milk out.

review/summary: Tip for easy way to store open CANS of this excellent brand of condensed milk
review/text: I like the idea of these squeeze bottles and I will investigate how cost effective it is to use them instead of the cans which work well for me.<br /><br />I have been using sweetened condensed milk in my coffee, off and on since learning to use it as a child at my grandparent's adjacent farm over on the other side of the squash field.  My Father preferred HEAVY cream (we had our own cows) sweetened with THREE teaspoons of sugar but even as a child, I did not care for that over the top combo normally favored by those engaged in heavy labor (a good description of my father with his day job and plowing at night by tractor headlights) as a quick caloric boost.  In these sedentary days, your doctor would put you on the don't call back list for such a dietary sin.  I actually prefer BLACK coffee when making a brew with my favored fresh ground (Vietnamese, espresso) but I was given a Keurig as a present and all the K-cups available taste better to me with some milk in them and those machines are too easy to use for that first quick jolt in the AM. The canned milk is very rich and it will last forever in the refrigerator, unlike any fresh milk/cream.  I find that La Lechera seems to be less sweet than the old standby, Eagle Brand and that pleases me.  This brand works perfectly for Vietnamese iced coffee which if you have never had, I suggest you try soon-- I enjoy it on an occasional basis in the summer and everyone I have introduced to it likes it a great deal.<br /><br />Anyway, I had the same problems with storing open containers until I realized that pet food can lids would work well.  They are (presumably) food grade plastic, inexpensive at the pet super stores and fit the condensed milk cans perfectly (same size as a standard tuna/cat food can)-- some are even cleverly molded to fit several different sizes of can to also fit the larger cans.  With normal handling, the milk NEVER touches the lid so even mystery plastic should not be a great consideration but I would look for a brand that is not made in China from industrial waste if that is possible anymore-- I have 4-5 that I have been using as pet food lids for years, acquired pre-Chinese economic invasion.  These lids work better and easier than the side cutting can openers which provide the cutoff part of the can as a lid!

review/summary: Yummy, wish I tried it before >***look at my  STORAGE/STABILITY information
review/text: I wish I tried it before...used over strawberries, ANY FRUIT, and on Oatmeal, YUMMY!<br /><br />It's great stuff and don't worry about it going bad, it stays good for at least 3 weeks, then use the tried and true smell method before you toss it, but am sure it will be used by then.<br />I plan on taking the top off when I use it next time in quantity...thickens when cold to the point of making it a real workout if you have more than two tugs on the bottle, take the cap off.<br />INFO:<br />check the "best before"-date on the label of the milk product to ensure that you are buying the freshest milk available.<br /><br />The sweetened condensed milk conditioned in a metal or plastic container if unopened can be stored at room temperature and the shelf life is about 6 month from the manufacturing date. The preservation of the milk is obtained through heat treatment (85-90 �C), condensation, increased sugar content and the air-tightness of the package. The benefits of this treatment include totally destroying osmophilic and thermophilic microorganisms and inactivating lipases and proteases, which decreases fat separation and inhibits oxidative changes.<br /><br />Opened canned milk should be immediately transferred to a clean glass or plastic container, covered and stored in the refrigerator. It should be used within 3 weeks of opening. If you don't consume the opened milk during these weeks, it is possible to freeze it (the earlier the better). The storage time of frozen milk at -18 �C amounts approximately 3 months. For reusing defrost milk in the refrigerator over night. If it contains a lot of fat, it is important when defrosted to give it a good shake to remix the fatty and watery parts.<br />UPDATE:<br />Oh, did you know water never expires if in any sterile container (if not sterile, add a drop of bleach to it) that is no biodegradable?  It may taste stale after a hundred years but it is still drinkable, won't hurt you...same goes with juices, like the ones I sent you.<br />Manufactures are required to put best if used by, because the food quality may be a fraction of a percentage less than the quality when it was first canned.  Canned goods from the sea may have been a bit faded in a color and the consistency strained, but totally edible if the can was not breached.<br /><br />IT STAYED GOOD FOR almost 6 weeks, twice as long as my research...maybe it would have been great longer.. OPENED, BUT REGRIGERATED...Last night I opened some canned strawberries...had some sweetened condensed milk, really thick, in a squirt bottle in the fridge for over two months, it still was great, even though it's not supposed to last more than 3 weeks.  Had two cans of strawberries and cream.

review/text: It was weird weather for Ho Chi Min City. But what isn't weird over here. December is the start of the dry season, but tell that to the rain that was soaking me down to the bone. I just came back from delivering -- let's just call them school supplies -- across the Cambodian border. I needed out of the downpour and stopped at one of the dozens of two stool restaurants that lined the curb. I was gonna ditch the scooter and head over to Mien Tay Bus Station. Getting outta Dodge seemed like a good idea at the moment. But first, a cuppa joe.<br /><br />"Cafe filtre, sil vous plait," I said to the 9 year old kid waiting tables. I coulda said it in English, Japanese, German or Russian. The kid woulda caught my drift. You grow up fast and fluent on Pnam Ngu Lao. Especially when you're hustling tables at Bobby Flay's latest dive.  The kid brought me my coffee cup with the dented tin filter on top, typical Vietnamese style. But instead of the usual crusty, fly-specked can of Longevity Condensed Milk, he brought this oblong thing...with finger grips on the side.  "Grenade in the house" I yelled and threw myself under a passing grandmother.<br /><br />When the kid stopped laughing, he helped me up and showed me it was just a bottle of LaLechera Sweetened Condensed Milk.  "What are you trying to pull, kid" I asked. I'm not gonna fall for another slipped mickey. Not at this stage of the game.<br /><br />"It's really good condensed milk. Check this out: a new and convenient container instead of that awful tin can. Much more hygenic, with an easy pour spout and ergonomic design; not to mention it's quite attractive," he said, his eyes cutting from side to side to see who might be listening. The guy at the next table looked like he was trying to be invisible.  I gave the kid a little nod in that direction and he lowered his voice. "The taste is excellent." he sotto voced me. "Sweet and rich, but with an underlying caramel savor. It really brings out the soul of the coffee.  On a wet night like this, it's comforting.  Plus you can use it on fruit, just a small spoonful transforms fruit salad or a dish of berries into a rich, satisfying dessert. And for a special treat, spread a little on toasted raisin-walnut bread or try it on warm gingerbread." With that, the kid disappeared into the crowd. I never saw him again. Or maybe I did. I broke my glasses when the old lady from the grenade incident came after me with her cane.<br /><br />Anyway I tried the coffee with the LaLechera.  It was good. The rain let up so I got back on the cyclo and headed for the bus station. One too many good times here in HoTown.  Time to check out. Besides I was all out of the Hello Kitty pencils and had to pick up another dozen Spongebob Stencil Sets at the Staples in Hanoi. Maybe check out those new dayglo rulers I've been hearing about too. Snooze and lose, that's how it works in School Supplies. One last look around for memory's sake. Man, they don't call it HoTown for nothing. Christmas time and the place was crawling with Santas.

review/summary: Maybe I got a bad one
review/text: I love sweetened condensed milk. I use it in my coffee, pour it over fruit (kiwi and tart strawberries turn into something extraordinary with scm over them), and I especially love it on an iced dessert called halo-halo. Move over vanilla ice cream...some scm and shaved ice just takes my breath away.<br /><br />So when I saw this bottle I thought I'd seriously scored big. No more fiddling with messy cans or figuring out longterm storage. However, these thoughts were soon dashed after bringing the product home. The taste was "off" somehow. Best I can describe it was as dusty-tasting and stale. The sell-by date was fine, so maybe I just got a bad batch. However, I haven't purchased another one since and have gone back to my Eagle and Asian brand sweetened condensed milks.

review/text: I have used condensed milk ever since I was a kid.  La Lechera Brand, in the squeeze bottle is a great idea.  Easy to dispense product and store.  It Will last a long time even OUTSIDE of the Fridge! I am in a harsh environment and that characteristic is priceless.

review/text: I used this for my Thai Iced tea and I was satisfied with the results. The milk was creamy and slightly sweetened. I added 2 sugar cubes and it was the taste that the I was familiar with at thai restaurants. I don't know if I'll use all 4 bottles, that's a lot of thai Iced tea, but it was cheap enough that I don't regret the purchase. Probably won't purchase again.<br /><br />pros:<br />decent taste<br />cheap<br />convenient cap and pour<br /><br />cons:<br />maybe a little "plastic" if that makes any sense
