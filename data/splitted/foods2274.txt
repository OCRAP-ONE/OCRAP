review/summary: Healthy Dog!
review/text: This is a great product. Although my dog would prefer some tasty wet food, my mind is at ease when he eats this healthy, grain free dog food. The best part about getting this dog food was that I didn't even have to get off the couch to order it and it was on my doorstep in 2 days with AMAZON PRIME!!!!

review/summary: GREAT DOG FOOD
review/text: The Wellness grain-free dry dog food recently ordered from Amazon.com is very nutritious.  My mini schnauzer never wanted to eat dry dog food until I started give her Wellness, which I had originally purchased for the newest member of our family, a Border Collie, who also loves it!  The product was well packaged and came in only two days.  I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: Although my picky dog does not like this, all the other dogs that visit my home do.  I dog sit so I like to have extra food for them just in case.  My dog Snickers doesn't seem to like any dry food until another dog came to stay with us for awhile and he had Kibbles and Bits and Snickers loved it but the other dog ate all of the Core and wouldn't touch his Kibbles and Bits.  So I gave the half used bag of Core to his owner.  Core is made of very good stuff and just because my picky little Snickers doesn't like it, I would not hesitate to recommend it.

review/summary: Grain-free for low-activity dogs
review/text: This is a great choice if your schedule/budget/dog's appetite doesn't allow for raw food or a freeze-dried solution. If you're on this page, chances are you've read about feeding your dog a natural, grain-free diet to combat issues with your dog's health, most commonly skin-related. Many dogs have a grain "allergy," causing itchiness and rash, which is often wiped out by switching to a grain-free diet.<br /><br />My dog doesn't do the raw thing, being an old man and set in his ways, and so he prefers kibble. I've personally never fed him anything but grain-free food, and hardly ever notice him scratching or biting at his skin. He absolutely loves this food, and being old and lazy having a low-fat alternative is great for his activity level. There are many grain-free choices out there, so I would personally highly recommend trying different kinds to see what your dog likes - I have to admit that I haven't seen many low-fat grain-free kibble products, so this is the one I went with. Couldn't be happier, especially with Prime shipping!

review/text: I am frim believer in feeding my pets premium dog food. I have been through a few different kind, and Wellness Core is fantasic. I have a high energy Cardigan Welsh Corgi,and she loves the food. I love that it is not grained based, she has a very shiny, healthy coat. eats less, and has less stool. It is well worth the money. Amazon by far has the best prices on all dog and cat food, and most of it will qualify for free shipping.

review/summary: Glossy coat, indeed!
review/text: I have been feeding my pup this food for the last 6 months (after she turned 1), and the glossiness and softness of her coat is amazing. On our walks and at the dog park, people regularly comment on how pretty and shiny her coat is. She is an energetic, playful pup who is constantly coming back from the dog park with a healthy layer of slobber, and after about 30 minutes, her coat is glossy again, no need to brush it or anything.<br /><br />An added bonus is she LOVES the food. I've even used some kibbles as treats and she does all her tricks for just a bite of it. Great stuff, she'll be a wellness pup for life!

review/summary: It's working and they love it!
review/text: I switched to Wellness about 2 months ago.  I buy the low cal one for my "bigger" girls and the regular Core food for my other dogs.  Best change I ever made.  It's not cheap -- I have 7 dogs, but their health is more important.  I mix either Wellness Core canned or Paul Newman's Organic canned food in in the am and the dry kibble in the pm.  All the dogs love it.  No gastric problems -- I've a bulldog and they have sensitive tummys and she loves this and has much less gas.  Before this i tried Royal Canin, which they also liked, but I decided to go totally grain free.  Again, pricy, but worth it if you can save on vet bills and have healthym happy animals.  Every one of my dogs love it -- and a few of them are fussy eaters.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a healthy alternative for their pets.  I change up the flavors every now and then to keep them from getting bored.  I know I wouldn't want to eat the same thing every night - hence the addition of the canned mix.<br />My Golden, who's over weight, has lost 5 pounds eating the lo cal version -- I couldn't be happier with this product.

review/summary: Excellent food
review/text: I purchased this food for my finicky chihuahua. I noticed that I was throwing away more of her Royal Canin Chihuahua food than she was eating, so I knew I needed to make a switch, and I wanted to try high-quality, grain-free foods.  At the recommendation of several friends, I decided to try Wellness Core and am so glad I did! The first day I mixed it with her previous food (Royal Canin Chihuahua) and she actually spit out the old food and only ate the Wellness Core!  She didn't have any stomach issues with it.  The next day she again gobbled down the Wellness Core.  My only complaint is that the pieces are a little big for her (a little smaller than a dime). She can still manage, but I wish there was a small dog version.  When I decided to make the switch to Wellness Core, I calculated how much it would cost in comparison to the Royal Canin Chihuahua I had been buying.  I was actually paying $14 for 2.5 lbs of Royal Canin at Petsmart, but got 12 lbs of Wellness Core, a higher-quality food for $29.99 with free shipping on Amazon- quite a savings!  I would recommend that anyone looking to go grain-free, or even just wanting a higher quality food try Wellness Core!

review/summary: Wellness Core
review/text: I have 2 dogs, ages 5 and 10, and we have tried numerous foods. My dogs had been on Blue Buffalo and my vet recently told me to switch because he had read some negative things about it. He wanted me to switch to Science Diet, Eukanuba or Iams and I knew I did not want to put my dogs on any of them. I started with Wellness Super Mix and then switched over the the Grain Free as I noticed my bassett hounds eyes were tearing up a lot and had a friend put her dogs on grain free food for the same reason. They tolerated both foods very well, however; I am going to try the Wellness for allergies as I still notice her eyes to be tearing up. Both of my dogs have a loooong history of bladder infections and have both been to the vet twice in the last 6 months to have their urine checked and have remained infection free. I feel that it's because of the switch to Wellness.

They had this video of their state of the art facility where everything was hospital clean and everyone wore gloves and masks. Now I just found out via a salmonella recall notice that Wellness doesn't even make their own dog food! They outsource it to Diamond foods where several other brands are also produced in the same facility! It's the same food in a different fancy looking bag. I have just switched to a new company called "Life's Abundance". This food is produced and sold directly from the manufacturer to you with no middleman.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods RECALLED
review/text: Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

review/summary: Hi quality raw sunflower lecithin
review/text: I read about lecithin years ago in an old nutrition book by Adele Davis, and decided to try it. I liked it, or liked the idea of taking it anyway, but stopped taking it when I learned that some health problems I was having at the time were related to soy in my diet. My health improved greatly when I stopped eating soy, but I missed the lecithin.<br /><br />I was happy to discover recently that other types of lecithin were available. One source is sunflowers.  I tried sunflower lecithin capsules, but was less than enthused about them.  Nothing wrong with them, but they felt like an inert food somehow, maybe because of the processing when it's put into the capsules.<br /><br />I found LoveRawFoods Raw Sunflower Lecithin online a few weeks ago and decided to try it. It's a little pricey, not so much the product itself, which is reasonably priced, but when you combine the product price with the shipping, it adds up.  But I'm glad I bought it.  I really love it.  It's great to be able to eat lecithin again after all of these years.<br /><br />To reiterate: sunflower lecithin is not like soy lecithin. Soy lecithin is an industrial waste product marketed for human consumption (made usually from genetically modified soybeans). It's toxic and bad for you.  Sunflower lecithin is a beneficial food product derived from sunflower seeds. And better yet, the LoveRawFoods brand is raw. Very cool.  It tastes like very fresh sunflower seeds.  I'll keep buying it as long as LRF keeps making it.<br /><br />If you're new to lecithin, I'd recommend mixing some into a smoothie, till you develop a taste for it. I actually eat it by the spoonful. But I know that's unusual :)Most people would want to mix it into some food.

(which is why it soy lecithin in about all processed foods)  Love sunflower products and eat them often. Very healthy, sustainable food source and great for the environment.  This is a great product, lasts a long time, depending on how you use it.  I put a spoonful in for my nut milks which lasts me a couple days.

review/summary: Blue Mountain Is No Longer Organic or Solvent-Free
review/text: Until recently, this product was organic and extracted without hexane, a chemical solvent. It was that way when I purchased it from Amazon. It even had the USDA Organic Seal on its label. None of this is any longer true. Blue Mountain SFL is no longer organic nor is it extracted without the solvent hexane or acetone (nail polish remover). Apparently, Blue Mountain lowered the quality of its liquid sunflower lecithin, but not its prices.<br /><br />Luckily, the MySunflowerLecithin.com website offers another brand of liquid sunflower lecithin - Lekithos.  The website has several grades of SFL. It also has a powdered form, but it is only 95% sunflower lecithin. (I wonder what the other 5% consists of.) I will buy their organic and mechanically extracted SFL next time. It is more expensive but I refuse to buy it non-organic or any soy lecithin - non-GMO or not - organic or not.<br /><br />All SFL are non-GMO, as I think all sunflower products are - so far. Nearly all soy products now have GMOs.

review/summary: Flavors were not as good as I hoped originally... BUT... Incredible Customer Service!!!!  FIRST CLASS
review/text: UPDATED Review as of Jan 20, 2012:<br /><br />I originally ordered 2 sets of these syrups, one for myself and one for a friend so I would like to make this a two part review/explanation as we each had different experiences apparently.<br /><br />My experience: I enjoy the Peppermint, however the EggNog and Gingerbread flavors were not as good as I hoped, and they all (minus the peppermint) separated and are so thick they are near impossible to re-mix together (which admittedly may be affecting the flavor...).  I originally gave this a 2 star rating due to being unhappy with 2 of 3 flavors in the set.<br /><br />My Friends experience:  He was happy with the overall flavors, however was disappointed with the separation issue I mentioned above.  HOWEVER, based on my original review on Amazon, the company contacted my friend via telephone the very next day (They somehow got his phone # from the order, VS my account information).  They were apparently VERY concerned with the product not being up to par, and even rushed him replacement syrups, reported to their internal R&D, etc.<br /><br />In summary, my review was 2 stars based on flavors, my friends is 5 stars based on customer service, so I am giving this a 4 star average review, as the company went above/beyond.

So far, my favorite has been to add a few swirls (doesn't take a lot) to plain, unsweetened yogurt. So delicious. I am going to attend a 'Say Goodbye to Winter' party next month, and I am thinking of making cupcakes and flavoring the frosting with these syrups. Make a plain, buttercream frosting, divide into 3 portions and flavor each with a splash of these Christmas syrups. I think I can label them 'Winter's Last Hurrah!'. Haven't tried it yet, but I can't imagine one reason why it won't be completely delicious and a big party hit. Thanks, Amoretti.

With the right beans/grinder combination, it is amazing what you can make!  However, I had a hankering for some flavored drinks and set out in search of some syrups.

I've had no issues with separation (mentioned by a previous reviewer) - all of the syrups appear to be well mixed, and stay that way.<br /><br />I've had a chance to try all three syrups now, so I thought that I'd write a quick review.<br /><br />Peppermint:<br />I use this syrup to make Mint Mochas, etc.  It has a great taste - an excellent balance of sweetness and minty flavor.  Not overpowering at all.  One pump puts the perfect amount of mint into an 8oz drink.<br /><br />Eggnog:<br />Quite good as well.  Again, one pump is enough for an 8 oz drink.  Truly tastes as if I made the drink with actual eggnog!<br /><br />Gingerbread:<br />This one has some flavor "power" behind it, so I prefer about half a pump.  It tastes distinctively of gingerbread, so hits the nail right on the head flavor-wise.  Combines nicely with chocolate to make a unique drink.<br /><br />Overall, I've been very impressed with Amoretti Syrups and their customer service as well.  I'd highly recommend them if you're looking for a tasty (and reasonably low calorie way) of flavoring drinks!

review/text: After I spent about $10.00 @ McDonald's for hot chocolate. My Husband found these on Amazon. I put them out with a thermos full of hot chocolate for our Christmas party, and everyone loved it (especially the peppermint). It tastes just like McDonald's. I wish I would have found them sooner!!

review/summary: A Nostalgic Find
review/text: In her younger days, a friend of mine backpacked throughout Europe.  She mentioned that she always had a bottle of mushroom ketchup with her and used it to season almost everything.  In recent weeks, a group of us have been exploring umami--the 5th taste sensation.  I was told this product may be the ultimate example of umami.  I was expecting a thick sauce like the tomato ketchup I've always known and loved.  I was surprised to see the thin, liquid consistency.  The taste is pleasantly unique.  Savory.  A little like Worchestershire sauce, but not as harsh.  Are you up for a taste adventure?  I recommend trying this.  I found recipes for the traditional product of years gone by.  I'm strongly recommending this time and labor saving choice instead.  I bought 2 bottles--one for my friend, and one for me.

review/text: We were given a small sample carton of Bil-Jac food about 3 weeks ago. It was part of their "challenge pack." My dogs had it for dinner that night and we put the rest on the counter for their next meal. Well, some time during the night, our dogs got the package down (which they've NEVER done before!) and not only ate every morsel, but they destroyed the carton! My dogs are not at all destructive so it was a huge humorous surprise in the morning! I took a picture of the carton to send to the company. Great stuff! Oh, yeah, they both are looking very healthy from this food as well!

review/summary: Five years of Success
review/text: I've been feeding a scoop of this kibble every night to my Portuguese Water Dog Goji for five years. It is the only kibble my fussy companion will always eat. He loves Chicken and there is quite a bit of it in this food. He has had no health issues and we look forward to feeding him Bil-Jac for years to come. I also feed him a raw meat patty (Nature's Valley frozen) every night, and a couple of large Bil-Jac biscuits in the morning. Goji is a very powerful high energy dog, and Bil Jac fuels some of that energy. I learned about this food at a booth Bil-Jac had at a big AKC show in San Francisco where they were giving out free samples. Highly recommended.

review/summary: A Big Ripoff!
review/text: I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!

review/summary: Great instant soup!
review/text: I like all three instant soups currently available on Amazon from Sushi Chef, but this is my favorite.  It has a nice dashi flavor, just the right amount of saltiness without being too salty at all.  At 25 calories per serving it is nice to sip on as a little snack.  The dehydrated mushrooms and other solids are nicely sized.  I agree with some other comments that it isn't difficult to make some nice quick broth with dashi flakes, miso paste, etc., but this is something easy to keep around, especially at the office, in my briefcase, etc.  I just discovered this a few weeks ago and have already ordered more twice.  Give it a try... I think you'll like it.

review/summary: Order Mix Up
review/text: Let me preface this by saying that this is more of a review for the vendor rather than the soup itself. I ordered the clear soup but instead received the wakame soup, which is ok, though not what I was hoping to get. The packets came in a clear plastic bag and were coated with some sort of powder (maybe some soup mix) which was kind of off-putting but forgivable if it was the right product. Unfortunatelly, I opened a few of the packets without realizing that it wasn't the right soup so I can't really return the order. I am going to keep it, but I'm dissapointed that I didn't get what I ordered and paid for. There is no "contact seller" option for this vendor so I dont really know how to go about asking them to fix it, and it's not really worth it. Just be careful not to order too much at first just in case this is some sort of common issue. Hopefully it was a fluke.

We tried some by Blue Buffalo, which she liked, but they made my hands smell gross, and I did not want to put smelly, crumbly treats in my pocket.  I found these Tricky Trainers at a local fancy pet store and THEY ARE WONDERFUL.  My dog will do nearly anything to get these.  They smell like cheddar cheese, instead of funky liver or whatever.  They do not leave my hands smelly, they do not leave stinky crumbs in my pockets (no crumbs at all) and they're super easy to manage.<br /><br />I highly recommend these to anyone looking for a clicker training treat for a 25+ pound dog, or as a regular treat for a very small dog.

review/summary: so frustrated - I REALLY wanted to love it
review/text: Searching for food dye that does not have any corn derivative in it is really difficult. I found this and was willing to pay $30.00 for it!!!<br /><br />1. The set is for 3 colors and you can mix to make all the pretty colors in the pictures, I am an artist and have not problems with mixing colors. It comes with Red, Yellow, blue<br /><br />2. Problem 1: The blue was not blue at all - it was swampy muddy green. not teal, not blue-green, not anywhere close to Blue. I shook and shook the product until I was blue in the face and was still a swampy mud brown/green. Absolutely nothing I can do with this color. My daughter wanted a princess cake with pink and purple - I said no problem. Big Mistake - I simply CANNOT make purple from this color.<br /><br />3. It takes a TON of coloring to shade the icing. I have 2 pounds of icing (standard for a small cake) - it took over 1/2 the red to make a light pink icing. So frustrating. Now, the red is almost gone and I cannot make purple. this stinks!<br /><br />4. Oh yea, it cost $30 for this??<br /><br />Save your money - make your own dye from food - I am about to go on an exploration to find the perfect way to make purple because my little girl just wants a pink and purple cake.

review/summary: Can't recommend this salt to anyone.
review/text: I purchased six different varieties of spices from this company.  Four of them were acceptable and two were not.  This one was one of the ones that I wish I had not purchased.  The price is much lower than the gourmet salts you can buy on Amazon, but the true cost of a product depends on the value you receive from it.  This smoked salt smells exactly like liquid smoke.  It you like that aroma, you will probably like this salt.  The salt arrived too moist, as if it had been in a humid environment, but it was easily broken up.  I had hoped to use this as a table condiment, but felt it detracted from the food rather than enhancing it.  I then tried it while cooking and felt it fell short there as well.  I ended up trashing it, thereby making it the most expensive salt I had ever purchased.<br /><br />I love the Artisan smoked salts I have purchased on Amazon and intend to buy several other varieties of that brand.  While initially more expensive, I can wholeheartedly recommend that brand.  Sadly, I cannot recommend the Marshalls Creek brand.

The larger package (tray) container is much easier to get correct.

review/summary: Tuna oil?
review/text: If organic truly matters to you the fact that tuna oil is added to this puree is truly offensive. The mercury levels in tuna are high enough that pregnant and nursing women are advised to avoid  certain amounts,  yet it is okay to add to a babies food?  And it is not specified as derived from organic or wild caught tuna.  This carries absolutely no logic and just goes to show what happens when a major food company attempts organic.  Garbage, complete and total garbage.

review/summary: Product is good, packaging needs improvement
review/text: The packaging is rather painful to open.  They should design these with parents of new babies in mind.  Most food products with peel tops have one corner which is indicated as the side to open and the hard plastic has a crack allowing for the user to easily bend and peel the top.  No such luck with these tubs of baby food from Gerber.  It's not clear which side should be opened by the packaging and whichever one you choose will be equally stubborn before you can finally peel the top and feed your hungry baby.

review/summary: Baby likes it enough to eat it however, I just found out it's plastic #7
review/text: I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day. I asked myself if I've researched into the plastic used. Glad to know that it doesn't contain BPA. Recycling #7 can be good or bad plastic. I've read that it's best to go with #1, #2, #4 and #5 plastics. So I decided to err on the safe side. I am giving this a 3-star because it's probably not a big deal but since I know about it, I don't want to live with that uncertainty that I may be harming my baby.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />My baby ate 5 tiny spoons of it the first time he tried the peas. After that, it kinda got boring for him and then I mixed it in with his cereal, and he ate it all. I would describe the taste as non-offending. It is neither sweet nor sour and is mild tasting to be one of the first foods to introduce.<br />I had thought the product would contain only organic peas and water, but it has more (like tuna oil etc.). I guess that's alright. We use quite a few vegetables and fruits from Earth's Best and I think it's good to offer different brands.

review/summary: A touch overpriced, but a fine product
review/text: These cost more on Amazon than the grocery store, but it is sometimes more convenient to just have them shipped to you.  We used these to help our baby feel "more comfortable" if she was having issues with going to the bathroom.  This worked like a charm.  We ended up having a regular rotation where we made sure she got this in the morning every few days to prevent any problems.

review/text: This is a good choice for organic prunes for baby.  I make most of my baby's food but buy her prunes for the additional fiber and it's easier than making them.  These are a decent value for the price normally, but really good in this case option.  Normally at stores it's the 2 tub pack for $1 and change.  This case has 8 of the packs, making it a total of 16 tubs.  It's a lot of prunes but she eats them often and loves them.

I use a popcorn popper and find it very easy and quick for small batches.  The sampler is a good way to experiment to find out what coffee bean and roast style that you like best.  The 8 oz packages was the right amount for my needs - I only drink a cup or two a day and do not want to have roasted beans sitting around for days getting stale.<br /><br />Word of caution: you have no idea what beans they are going to ship to you in the sampler but since the quantities are small I did not think this was a big deal.

That will be little trouble too.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NBGHM">5 Lb. Organic Fair Trade Green Coffee Sampler</a>

review/text: Great if you want to try a variety of beans!  All of mine were from South America, but I didn't mind.  I've only roasted one batch but it turned out just fine.

review/summary: coffee beans
review/text: I like this company.  Fair trade coffee is important to me and I want to deal with a company that believes the same thing.  It doesn't hurt that the company is located in the same state as I am.  I would strongly recommend this company.

review/summary: Ok but has a lot of sugar
review/text: This Muesli has a generous amount of protein and would be a great wholesome meal for someone on a mass building regimen.<br /><br />On the other hand it also 17g of sugar per serving - a combination of cane sugar and fructose. This makes the cereal really sweet.<br /><br />Its unfortunate that the ingredients label is not available on the website(as of my writing this review) to let buyers know the full contents of the package.

review/summary: Sweet and convienient
review/text: This is the second bottle of Stevia Glycerite that I have purchased because it is a more natural sweetness than others that I've tried and the convienience of just open the cap and let a couple of drops out. Also Stevia in general is helping keep my blood sugar under control.
