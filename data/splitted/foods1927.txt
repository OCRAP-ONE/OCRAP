review/summary: Great taste!
review/text: This salt is so tasty!  It tastes nothing like the iodized table salt.  This has a light, mild taste that greatly enhances meats, vegetables, etc.  It's pink/peach color also looks very pretty in my clear Cole/Mason grinder.  It grinds very finely with no issue.  In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.  If you're a neat freak, this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder.  Great salt and the bag lasts a long time.

review/text: Just like in the store for a fraction of the price. I purchased this to refill my expensive pink salt grinder. A million times better than table salt. I don't know if it tastes any different from regular table salt but I think there is something about the shape of the crystals that changes the way the salt hits your tongue. If you have a good grinder I highly recommend checking this stuff out.

review/summary: Good salt
review/text: The bag was smaller than I expected, but that's probably just me being bad at estimating things.  The salt seems good, however, I was a little disappointed that the photo showed the salt to be much more vibrantly colored than they actually are.  I mean, they are pink, just not so bright pink as it shows.  The salt has a good flavor though.  I'd say it was worth the price.

review/summary: Difficult packaging
review/text: Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon).

review/summary: SALT OF THE EARTH - Himalayan Style
review/text: Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.  So now, it's like buying a red, Ford Mustang.  It's all you see on the road or, in this case, on the shelves of the stores.<br /><br />I'm actually glad I purchased this and have stopped using regular old white salt almost totally.  The salt does seem to have a milder taste but I don't find myself using any more of it than I did with the good old "when it rains it pours" variety.<br /><br />Since ordering this from Amazon, I've managed to find some here in my little town but it is way expensive.  When you purchase this you will also need a salt grinder unless you like throwing big chunks of salt at your food.  Worth getting the two together, however, especially if you purchase a grinder with a glass container as the salt really looks attractive in a pretty, transparent grinder.  And, of course, it tastes good, too.  About it's nutritional value I admit to knowing zip.  Does salt HAVE nutritional value?  In the meantime, I give this four stars.  If I find out more about the actual food value I'll update this review.

Just recently, I tried it iced, and let me just say that I'm hooked! The fresh peach notes and that slightly spicy, gingery bite make for a really refreshing iced tea--no sweetener needed. I've always been an English-breakfast-tea girl, but I can't get enough of this fragrant blend!

review/text: I'm feeding my cat the Nutro MAX CAT Indoor Weight Control formula, because she's on the chubby side.  I think it's working, because she's thinning out, and we haven't used up the bag, yet.<br /><br />The food comes with a money back guarantee that the cat will like the food, which she does, so I didn't have to take them up on the offer.  I'm not sure if we have to return the unused portion back to the manufacturer, like we would for some human foods.  The package didn't say.<br /><br />The food doesn't have a strong odor, which some cat foods do -- another plus.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied with this purchase.

This tub lasts quite a while for me (I use them in a college level class for review sessions to "reward" students).  The tub is strong enough to withstand being dragged back and forth multiple times from my house to the classroom.  Additionally, students always enjoy the treats.  For the price, this is a great buy.

review/summary: wonderful taste!
review/text: I got this tea the first time in a tea shop.  I found it again on amazon.com and was delighted.  This is a great tasting tea, very different flavor than just regular black tea, has real zing with the rose petals & safflower flavoring.  It's hard to explain how it tastes and some may not like it, but I got 3 bags so i won't run out.  It only takes about 1/2 tsp of this loose tea to make one nice cup.  You can put the loose tea in a round enclosed strainer & pour boiling water over it to steep, or put the loose tea straight into the tea pot & strain as you pour.  I usually mix the tea with a pinch of loose green tea.  If the flavor is too strong, you could mix with regular black tea, green tea, etc..  I really love it. Don't be put off by it's name. It's a nice foil package with paper lining inside the foil.  The only thing i'm disappointed with in these packages, that they didn't come with a resealer bendable thingy.  My other bag could be resealed each time, but these will need to be taped, or a large rubber band, clothes pin, etc... I can deal with that though. Love the tea!

review/summary: All flavors all not created equal
review/text: I have been using the Apricot-Mango Emergen-c off and on for close to a year now. I've been getting tension headaches and migraines for many years now. One day a headache came on so severe and I had nothing to get rid of it or even calm it down a little. I, for some unknown reason reached for a packet of Apricot-Mango Emergen-c and a little less than a half cup of water. Within 10 minutes or maybe even less, my headache was gone and had not returned. I really thought it was a fluke. The next day another headbanger of a headache came on and again I took the Apricot-Mango Emergen-c and within minutes it was gone and now I'm amazed. At some point I ran out and the Apricot-Mango was on backorder on the site I ordered it from so I ordered another flavor(Cherry-Pomegranate)Which did absolutely NOTHING for my headaches. Once the website I ordered from had them back in stock I ordered several boxes. I love this stuff because who knew that on top of everything else it's good for, it would also be great for headaches.

review/summary: One Of The Best Prodicts On The Market
review/text: Although priced 50% too high, this product is one of the best on the market. I purchased it and am pleased enough to include it in my daily menu. It can be sprinkled on and used in other foods and the combination is astounding. Fast acting and containing high nutritional content, this product is absorbed by the body quickly. All day benefits are experienced. Spouses, lovers, and significant others get ready: the libido will increase greatly too as the lack of energy decreases.<br /><br />Three ounces of water offers the best taste. But remember, good nutrition will not taste good all the time but you can expect the good nutrition in this product to do the job it was manufactured to do without the product leaving the body unused as is experienced with most pills and capsules.<br /><br />This product has no drawbacks. It is simply priced too high because those who do not know good nutrition will automatically assume that because the product has so many good things in it, it must be priced so high as to make it unaffordable. That way, consumers will buy the lessor quality product that contains minimal nutrition and miss out on experiencing the great benefits this great product has to offer.

review/summary: Decent low-carb option
review/text: All in all the blueberry muffins were good.  They are not super-sweet like many store or cafe bought muffins, but they were still yummy.  The texture is soft and fluffy, not cardboard.  It was nice to have these as a low-carb treat.<br /><br />The only negative is that the package only makes 11-12 small muffins at 4 carbs each (1 muffin is a serving).  I used the standard cupcake sized silicon baking cups and only got 11 with none of them baking any higher than the top of the cups.  One won't fill you up enough to have as breakfast by itself, but they make a great snack in the afternoon or paired with some berries for desert.

review/text: I made the fat-free version of these muffins according to the directions on the package.  The batter tasted good and they baked up really nicely.  However, they have a very strange texture and a weird chemical aftertaste.  I only ended up eating 2/12 and felt guilty even trying to give the rest away to a bunch of 20-year old college guys.  Sadly, I can't recommend them.  I generally love low cal subs, but this one sadly doesn't cut it.

That said, the box is exactly as pictured with a big puffy decorative bow. It's quite small. The bear is about the size of a beanie baby and the items inside were personal sized. I could see this going to a secretary or platonic style friend for Valentine's Day etc but if you forego roses for this gift basket your sweetie might dump the tiny packet of chocolate chip cookies on your head!

After a month the color has started to slowly change.  Overall I am happy with their customer service and assistance, however, the description listed should have explained that the expected product would not be received and that the color would change after some time.

review/text: OK, so I've been coughing up $5 a box for these crackers and they were even worth it at that price. The box is small, you don't get a lot, and the texture is really going to be a change from any other regular cracker you've ever tried. Don't expect consistent sizes or thicknesses either. These are super crisp crackers that snap when you bite them. They have a very strong sesame flavor with an awesome black pepper bite; definately savory! These aren't water crackers or Ritz for that matter. Once you adjust to the strong flavor you won't be able to stop. Serve with a bold cheese for best results.

review/summary: Only for Celiacs patients!
review/text: These are rice crackers and not very good ones. There are many other brands of rice crackers that are really moist and flavourful from Japan. If I had Celiacs disease I might consider having these around but you can't serve these to guests without a lot of explaining and some really sharp cheese. Be wary of making a 12 box commitment. Also these crackers come in a bag which means between 10%-25% are broken and they cannot be resealed which means they go flat very quickly. If you bought these and don't know what to do with them try opening the box and leaving it in the bathroom when you shower, it reduces the choking hazard. If you still can't adjust put them in a Zip-Lock and use them as packing material.

review/summary: Just Trust Them
review/text: While they have a few mustards to choose from I picked this one solely as a dare, to the Fallot people, to disappoint me.  I've had their Dijon and their Dijon with Peppercorn so I knew that they knew what they were doing.  When I saw the Gingerbread variant I figured it was the LEAST appealing.  For me that is always a sign of a way to expand my horizons so I went for it.  It is excellent.  The more detailed ingredients include wheat and spices.  It's not the gingerbread taste I was expecting, which is a good thing.  It is dijon with a very unique zip to it.  I put it on ham with a whole grain wheat bread.  I prefer high tech ingredients like Boar's Head rosemary & sundried tomato ham but it's too delicate for this particular mustard so just use a basic high quality meat.  Serve it to yourself though, unless you know someone who is a total "foodie."  I paired it(LOL) with a French beverage in the form of a Citadelle gin martini.  Look to the French for food and art and you won't be disappointed,

review/text: I don't have a green thumb, so it's fortunate for me that this bamboo is inexpensive, while I learn how to grow it.<br />I had purchased a vase with bamboo in it, from the local grocery store's floral department. The bamboo in it died (I THINK it was not my fault.. it was in bad shape when I bought it), but I loved the vase. So I just took this bamboo and put it in the vase. Looked so good and I still had enough bamboo, that I bought another vase and took the poor quality bamboo out to put this in. So far it seems to be doing well. I had enough bamboo left over to put in a third vase. It looks so good.<br />Bamboo was packed well and looked great upon arrival, and came with a little bottle of the green bamboo liquid food.

review/summary: Excellent - My New Morning Standard
review/text: Among all of Twinings' breakfast teas, this has become my latest standard. Steeping for only three or four minutes produces a deep, full-bodied liquor, which I find to be a bit richer than English Breakfast (which is still a fairly stout tea unto itself). As it's such a strong tea, Irish Breakfast holds up very well to milk and sugar.<br /><br />If you're looking for a lighter morning tea, Twinings Ceylon Breakfast is very nice.

review/text: Did you know that the Irish - *not* the English - are per capita the world's highest consumers of tea? No wonder, then, that there is a breakfast blend named for them; although Irish Breakfast is actually strong enough to be a great pick-me-up throughout the day. Traditionally, it consists primarily of teas from Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and the state of Assam in northeastern India. Irish Breakfast has an intricately full-bodied, malty, floral aroma and goes particularly well with milk (or cream, but real milk is preferable). Enjoy!

review/summary: Weaker than teabag version, faulty Amazon advertising
review/text: Twinings teabag Irish Breakfast Tea has four tea leaf rating while the English Breakfast Tea has three tea leaf strength rating, illustrated on the box.  The images of Twinings tea tins do not possess the strength rating, however, when I received my tins they both had three tea leaf strengths on the front of the tin.  I cannot explain the disparity in strength rating between teabag and tin for the Irish Breakfast tea.<br /><br />My reason for buying Irish Breakfast tea was for my first cup of tea, higher strength than their English Breakfast tea.  Amazon should correct this by getting Twinings to send updated images.  Similarly, written descriptions fail to indicate Twinings tea strengths using Twinings tea leaf rating system.  This should also be corrected.  My supplier's and Amazon's processing were both superlative.

review/summary: Tasty, but be aware of nutrient content
review/text: I like this product. I think it is quite tasty both to drink and over cereal, and I haven't had any problems mixing it (I shake it in a quart mason jar).  However, be aware that nutritionally, this "Vegan Beverage Mix" is not the same thing as liquid soy milk.  For instance, compared to Silk, it is lower in protein (2 g vs. 7 g), higher in carbohydrates (16 g vs. 8 grams), lower in calcium (8% DV vs. 30% DV), and contains no Vitamin D.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as you know what you're getting, and aren't relying on it as a significant source of these nutrients.

review/summary: Best Soy Milk Product Out There!
review/text: Ok I know what your thinking...soy milk...gag!<br /><br />I thought that way for a long time, but I really wanted to get off the cow juice for many health reasons.  So I started to try the various products out there and came away with a bad surprise - they were sweet!<br /><br />I guess in a attempt to deal with a perceived aftertaste many of the manufacturers have decided to add sugar.  Now I don't know about you but to me cow milk does NOT taste sweet - especially the 2% or 1% variety I was drinking previous to this product - so I didn't want my soy milk alternative to taste sweet either.<br /><br />I almost gave up the search until I tried this product.  I have purchased both the already prepared version of this product as well as the dry mix you just add water to and both versions DO NOT TASTE SWEET.  They are the closest thing you are going to find to the taste of real milk - especially when well chilled.<br /><br />I have tried the Silk Brand Unsweetened and there is just something too rich and creamy about it, the texture is wrong.  I can't quite nail it down - it just seems like something I would pour into coffee, not over my breakfast cereal.<br /><br />This is the better product - give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.

review/summary: Convient for everyday use and emergencies
review/text: I'm a vegetarian who takes protein basically wherever I can get it. Most pre-mixed soy varieties you find in the grocery store, other than silk, don't agree with me. The price of these canisters where pretty good on amazon and I was looking for an emergency supply of soymilk for those times I can't run to the store. so I gave it a shot. And now I love it so much I basically have a can with me wherever I go.<br /><br />I have always have soymilk when I need, it taste great (some people may find it a little bland, but a tablespoon or two of sugar mixed shaken with 32 oz of water before adding the soy will take care of that), it convient, doesn't spoil, and I can add it to anything since heat doesn't affect it. A tablespoon or two in hot tea (with sugar) and another in some instant whole wheat oatmeal in the morning, and you have energy to burn first thing in the morning without taking the time to cook!

review/text: I used to buy Lactose-free milk from the Supermarket and I can't handle the 'hard stuff'. I had tried Soy milk before but it was like drinking chalk mixed with water. What 'turned me' was Trader Joe's Original Soy milk which is just a perfect milk substitute; but they only sold it in 1/2 quart containers and the store was miles out of my way. Anyway, long story short I picked up a can of this stuff.<br />It's teriffic! Very easy to mix...can even do it with a spoon in a glass of water. Has a great taste and best of all it's a powder so it keeps pretty much forever. I'm trying to live more healthily and this stuff makes the pefect base for my morning smoothie, tastes exactly the same as when I made it using milk, even works ouit cheaper (and higher in protein...well, a bit).

review/summary: Do you like baby formula and stale cardboard? Well have I got a drink for you!
review/text: Wow - this is easily the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. I am a huge fan of soy products - I drink Silk, I eat vegan cheese of all flavors, I love soy yogurt - I've even dined on tofu dogs. I'm not a vegan (or even a vegetarian), I have an allergy to milk. For the most part I have been able to find all kinds of great substitutes for milk and dairy products. Because of all the great reviews I decided to give this a shot. First of all, let me just say that the amount of money you are supposedly saving is at best a stretch of the truth, and at most a blazing lie. I live in a relatively small area (where grocery prices are normally really jacked up) and I can find Silk and many other brands of soy, rice and almond milks for this price or less. So you probably are not saving as much as they claim.<br /><br />Now, on to the taste. It's not just that it's bad, it's that it's SO BAD my stomach is still turning. I'm not sure why other reviewers are giving it a good rating... maybe they're of the mindset that if you buy something vegan it has to be gross, which may have been true 30 years ago, but simply isn't the case today. I've had all kinds of dairy free foods that were fantastic - milks, breads, yogurts, ice creams, puddings, sauces, creams, etc. and they all tasted great. There is no excuse for the taste of this. I'm not joking or exaggerating at all when I say it tastes like old baby formula and stale cardboard. And I know it's not just me - I tried this stuff on three other people. Two of them got as far as smelling it and then refused to taste it (good move since it tastes worse than it smells) and one of them braved up and took a drink... and then pulled a face and wiped his tongue on his shirt. My mother suggested that I try to cover up the cardboard taste... couldn't be done. Then she suggested I try it in baking... but there is no way I'm putting THAT taste into cookies or cake.<br /><br />And please don't misunderstand and think that maybe I just don't like the taste of natural soy because I assure you that I do - I love roasted soy nuts, they're great. That is NOT the taste I am describing here, this is something else. Seriously, old baby formula and stale cardboard...

So when I found THIS product, I figured it would be better than nothing. I was very surprised when I tried it........it's great!! It was not only better than nothing,but it was better than some of the other soymilk I have tried. This product will definately save me alot of time searching for soy in other countries. I found that using less water makes it taste more like regular soymilk. I made a qt at a time & kept it in the fridge, but you can also use it just like creamora & add the powder to your coffee & it will mix up perfect,too. I hope this helps someone else who runs into this problem when you travel.

review/text: I bought this to travel with as my son is allergic to dairy and needs something to eat his cereal with. I agree with the other reviewer that it does not have the protein( only 2 gms) and calcium( 8%) to compare with milk or soy milk so it would not be a good idea to drink it all the time in place of soy milk. But it makes for a great travel drink given the restrictions in carrying liquids aboard planes. It mixes easily in cold water and tastes fantastic. Yes, it does taste better than 2% milk.<br />I figure it is better than nothing for trips to places which don't stock soy milk.

I didn't mind the taste of soymilk just to drink a small amount, but putting in on cereal or using it in recipes was out of the question.  Then we discovered Better Than Milk Soy Original.  It is not too sweet, and not too strong a soy flavor.  It's a beautiful creamy white color, and is the closest to drinking cow's milk that we've found.  Both my husband and I absolutely love it!  We don't even miss cow's milk anymore!  And buying the Better Than Milk through Amazon.com is very easy and convenient.
