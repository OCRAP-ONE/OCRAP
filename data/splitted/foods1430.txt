review/summary: Didn't buy on Amazon but
review/text: Since getting my Keurig machine I have been experimenting with variety of K-cups.  I didn't get this on amazon but caught it on sale at the local market.  It's a good basic cup of coffee.  While trying to figure out flavor preferences (with things like caramel, blueberry, etc.) it's nice to have a basic that you can rely on.  Some of the flavors aren't strong enough and some of the other brands or roasts are way too strong.  Nantucket blend is a happy medium.

review/text: Green Mountain Coffee, Nantucket Blend is my favorite coffee to use in my Keurig Brewer.  However, in this particular box, the coffee did not taste fresh.  Perhaps due to the large quantity in one box, it remained in storage too long.  At any rate, previous orders from other Amazon sellers, like az trading llc and pm trading, and smaller-quantity boxes from Amazon.com LLC were far superior.

I like dark coffee,  my daily drink is Timothy's Midnight Magic Extra Bold.  My wife likes Timothy's Morning Blend and prefers a light roast.  Even she didn't like this coffee and said "it tastes like warm milk".

review/text: I read several of the reviews before signing up for a subscription for this coffee. Usually Amazon customers are spot on, but in this case the reviews didn't help. This coffee is really weak, watery, and bland. Ever tried running water through a K-cup a second time? It's awful and tastes much like this coffee. AND SINCE IT IS A SUBSCRIPTION, IT'S NON RETURNABLE. That's right, I can't return a $30 order. Be sure you like this stuff before signing up or risk getting stuck with some really bad coffee.

It has a medium body with a smooth flavor. I don't care for dark roasts but I also wanted something that packed more of a punch than a light roast; the Nantucket blend definitely fits the bill.<br /><br />My only complaint about this coffee is that it does have a stronger aftertaste than I would like. I enjoy drinking the coffee but I am sometimes left with a bitter taste in my mouth.

Also, anyone want to tell me why the 48 count is more expensive than ordering 2 of the 24 count?  LOL

review/summary: A Perfect Coffee Blend, Our Favorite
review/text: If a milder, smoother taste is what you are looking for, you won't find anything better than Green Mountain Nantucket Blend. This is the first coffee I ever tried in my Keurig and it's been a staple in our variety of K-Cups for two years now. The quality is superb - I wouldn't expect anything less from Green Mountain. In fact, a friend who has a relative who works there says the quality control is so strict they throw out cups that have even a tish more or less coffee than the cups are supposed to. At less than 0.60 cents/cup, this is a bargain. With Prime Membership, to have these delivered to my door is too good to be true.

review/text: Had these scones for the first time at my mother-in-law's house.  She made them with my girls.  They are so easy to make and really good.  Not as firm and dense as traditional English scones, but that's ok, I have no preference, and I don't think the girls would have liked a denser scone anyway.  There are a ton of flavors and making them couldn't be easier.  These make a nice gift too when you need just a little something.<br />(And buying them in 4-packs here on Amazon gives a nice little discount.)

It even helps to keep my baby pooping regularly (before I drank this tea it would take between 4-6 days for her to poop and it was a extreme big poopy mess!). It lost a star because it takes a few days to get the milk to really start flowing. Love it anyway and will recommend to breastfeeding mothers.

review/summary: pessimism proved wrong
review/text: I am not into homeopathic methods for anything really. Like most everyone I grew up going to a Dr. And getting prescriptions when something was wrong with my health. I have hypoplasia...breast constriction,  and my Dr.s wouldn't prescribe me metformin which is a medication that promotes lactation because apparently breastfeeding isn't a high priority for him. I was told to give up breastfeeding...that it was too much for me to be doing (pumping and supplementing via a sns) especially with all the contributing factors (my son had tongue tie and bit me until i looked like a burn victim and therefore transferred almost no milk which made him frustrated and bite more) and that I'd b stuck with my low supply... 4 oz a day. Well I got a hospital grade pump, got this tea and more milk plus special blend capsules and in a month I am at 17 oz and climbing. I stared taking the recommended doasages of both; but now I drink the tea at least 5 times a day and I take the mothers.milk capsules 4-5 times a day. My breast tissue is expanding and growing...I am making more than half of.my sons food... don't hesitate to try this. Don't give up breastfeeding. I was told to give up even by the hospital lactation consultants... but with lots of work this tea, a stubborn personality and my mothers milk special blend capsules I quadrupled my supply so far.  I am so happy that my initial pessimism toward this herbal tea proved totally unfounded. Can you beloved a tea can help you lactate? Amazing.<br /><br />Aanother note on the company; I'm so impressed by the box that contains the tea,  I read it like a book,  what a fantastic company and what interesting information and encouragement they include on their packaging.

review/text: I bought this tea about a month and a half ago when my breast milk supply dropped, and it's worked great! However, it tastes horrible.<br /><br />My recommendation for taste? Buy a tea ball (it cuts down on extra powder escaping from the bag) and brew it with some other tea. I've been brewing mine with a bag of peppermint tea as well as MM tea, and I sweeten it with honey. It makes it drinkable, at least.

Amazon is the cheapest place that I've found to purchase it from too......I have it sent to me monthly so I don't have to worry about going out and trying to find it! Oh, it's nice cold over ice too....just be sure to let it stew so you get the full benefits, I make up a cup and leave the bag in while I drink it, for a cold one I just leave it to go cold and add ice :)

review/summary: Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.
review/text: I think that the only reason why this works for some people is because they are adding more liquid to their diet when they add this tea.  I was already a seriously lengthy water drinker and this made no difference to my milk production.  I am convinced that my epidural screwed my chances of breastfeeding easily.  I used pumps, which obviously work better than baby... but, even then my milk wasn't what it should have been.  My mother, grandmother, and aunts were all pretty surprised at the lack of milk I was producing, considering my healthy organic lifestyle and my large water and liquid intake.<br /><br />Oh well.  I tried this stuff for 3 months to no avail.

I am still nursing my 16 month old a few times a day, but after a weeklong vacation where he didn't nurse much (due to distraction) my supply was very low.  He would nurse for 45 mins and only get one letdown. After drinking a few cups of tea I noticed a huge difference.  Now he gets plenty of letdowns and milk in between :). I'm so glad this worked because he is obviously not ready to wean yet!

review/text: I purchased this tea after seeing a decrease in my supply when I went from breastfeeding to exclusively pumping.  I still have to suppliment with formula, but instead of feeding 4 bottles of formula a day, i only have to feed 1-2.  I can see this product being great for mother's returning to work that are worried about their supply decreasing by being away from their babies durring the day.  To make this product work, you deffinately still have to make an effort to breastfeed/pump regularly.

review/text: I have a 9 month old at home and have been solely breastfeeding her. I eat a healthy diet & drink about a gallon of water a day, but my production has slowly decreased over time. My stored milk had begun to run out, so I turned to this tea and also tried the fenugreek pills. I drank several cups of this tea every day for three weeks, just as directed on the box, yet I didn't produce even half an ounce more than I have been consistently making. While this tea may work well for others, I am personally disappointed with the lack of results.

review/summary: Great help for nursing mothers
review/text: I puchased this tea after some research, and recommendation from a friend.  Obviously, my concern was not producing enough milk for baby, so I decided to give it a try.  I must say that I am not a tea drinker.  This is the first tea I have ever had, and it doesn't taste good or bad.  I found it be pretty bland, and after drinking it for a while, it doesn't taste better or worse.  Per the instructions on the box, it says to drink 3-5 teas/day.  I drank 3/day for about a day and half before I noticed the increase in milk production.  It was not drastic, but enough for me to pump and freeze for when I returned to work.  I went from barely pumping 3 ounces to pumping 4-5, every 3 hours.  The tea works, but you must also stay hydrated, eat well, and rest as much as possible (if possible with an infant).  I have been drinking this tea for almost 3 months now, and I feel like it definitely works for me.  If you're hesitant, just know you have nothing to lose by trying :)

I had bought this tea for her as part of her baby shower gift and she says this has helped her immensely. She drinks about 3-5 cups and she says she can see visible increase in production. As far as I know, she tried bringing pictures of the little one to work, frequent pumping etc but this tea seems to have made the difference.<br /><br />Try it, at least for a week and if it doesnt make a difference, it doesn't, but you at least tried.

review/text: This stuff isn't the tastiest tea I've tried, but it does seem to boost my milk supply.

I'm not sure if this is totally because of the tea, or if it's just my body's response to my daughter nursing longer. Either way, there's scientific evidence that fenugreek teas increase milk supply - see ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21261516

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3POY">Traditional Medicinals Organic Mother's Milk Herbal Tea, 16-Count Wrapped Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Working pretty good for me. The box says to drink 3-5/day. A few months ago I only drank about 3/day. I noticed a small increase and stopped. THEN a couple of days ago I drank a LOT more, lol, probably 1/2-1 whole box a day! But it worked. I also increased my pumping sessions from 2x/day to 3 or 4/day, increased my water intake, decreased my caffinated coffee intake. Now I know doing all those things will increase milk production but doing those things in addition to drinking the tea increased it much, much faster.<br /><br />I haven't noticed any of the negative side effects for either my daughter or myself. I also don't drink it all the time, just when I need to bump up my supply.

review/text: I was told by a friend to try this tea since I was going to be having twins. It has definitely been working for me. The taste isn't too bad, and it doesn't upset my stomach. The tea has even been recommended by nurses to women who are having problems with milk production. I definitely recommend it!!!

review/summary: love this!
review/text: I love this product! It was the key for me to nursing. Due to low supply, I decided to start taking fenugreek to increase my milk supply. Nothing happened. Distraught, I went online and someone recommended to add this tea! This tea has been the key for me! My supply doubled and now I have been nursing my baby for eight months..when initially I didn't see how I could go two months! Be sure to keep on a regular schedule with both the fenugreek (I use the seeds) and the tea...amazon has a great price on it with the subscribe and save...I love it! I hope it works for you too..

review/summary: Didn't work for me
review/text: I ordered this item in hopes that it would help me with my milk output.  Right now I am barely keeping up with as much as my 4 month old will eat.  However, after using 5 out of the 6 boxes in my initial order, I saw absolutely no increase in my output.  I was really disappointed as there are so many awesome reviews.  Good luck if you intend to try it.  Just didn't work for me.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: Initially an overproducer, I was horrified when a mistake by my doctor in prescribing me the wrong birth control caused a dramatic drop in my supply where I wasn't even close to keeping up with my son while he was away at daycare. My lactation consultant recommended this tea to me and I ordered it right away. Earlier this week, I was pumping at best half of what I had previously pumped and we had started tapping into my freezer stash, which was scary to me. By Wednesday the tea had arrived and I immediately started drinking it. Thursday was my lowest day ever, I was able to pump only 6 oz total all day long and I was so discouraged. This morning I woke up with my breasts feeling very full like they had before my supply began to reduce and I just completed my first pumping session and was able to pump about a half ounce MORE than I typically pump! I drank the tea 3 times on Wednesday and 5 times on Thursday. Once I feel like my supply has completely regenerated, I will probably reduce the tea to 2 or 3 times a day, but this tea is amazing! What started out as a terrible and scary week (giving up breastfeeding was a very sad thought) has ended on a high note!

review/summary: Bummed
review/text: I ordered this tea because I wanted to produce more milk so I could pump and bottle feed my daughter because I didn't want her getting used to the breast 100%.  Unfortunately, it didn't work out for me.  I only gave it 3 stars because at around the 2nd or 3rd day, I noticed that I was breaking out in different areas of my body and it was very itchy.  I know it was the tea that caused the reaction because it was the only new thing I had started to take in and as soon as I stopped drinking it, the rash went away.  So I can't really rate its efectiveness because I didn't drink it long enough.  I'm not a big fan of tea, so I didn't care for the taste too much, but a little bit of sugar helped.

I didn't have enough milk, but after only few days drinking this tea I started pomping almost 6 oz from one breast. It's worth every dollar and it also taste delicious. Overall great product. I would recommend it to every mother who is breastfeeding.

review/summary: best gift for wives
review/text: I bought this tea for my wife based on a recommendation by a friend. She was nervous about producing enough milk, and she loved it! It helps with her discomfort that most women have those first few weeks of nursing and it helps her establish a good milk supply as well. All my babies have been chubby healthy breastfed babies. I also love how it is organic! I only want the best for my family.

review/summary: It really does work!
review/text: When I first starting breastfeeding my daughter I struggled with low supply due to her poor latch. My Lactation Consultant recommended I try this, and literally a day later she could tell a huge difference in my supply. It was amazing. 13 months later I am still breastfeeding and drinking 4 cups of this tea a day. I honestly can tell that my supply goes down on days that I dont drink my tea (we go on a day trip, forget to brew it, etc). Just a suggestion... I make all 4 of my glasses of tea in the morning and reheat them throughout the day. When you first brew them, cover your cups with something (not papery - I use tupperwear covers). It keeps some really awesome natural oils from evaporating with the steam. :)

review/text: This is the best milk-making tea I've tried. I brewed some last night and put it in the fridge to have as iced tea, and I drank one glass last night and a couple this morning. WOW is all I can say. I kept wondering what was going on as I started experiencing signs of engorgement, then I remembered the tea. I had to pump three times to prevent engorgement. I just ordered more, although in the future I probably won't drink as much of it at once! :)

review/summary: Yeahy More Milk!
review/text: A friend of mine recommended this item my first month and thank goodness for getting good recommendations. First it works within a hour or so you got more milk production. I normally drink a cup towards the evening hours when I fall short. Also helps when you go through a milk clog and the production slows down it helps a lot to get you back to where you need to be for your baby. The milk tea as my husband describes it smells like liqurious candy and it kind a does. As a devoted tea drinker it was also nice to have something to drink besides camomile tea. So the Subscription deal comes pretty handy.

review/summary: So far so good
review/text: I've been back at work now for almost 4 months and in the past couple of weeks I've noticed my production going way down. I used to get about 9-10 oz while at work but suddenly it dropped to 5-6 oz.<br /><br />I can't rate the effectiveness of this tea quite yet as I only started taking it and so far haven't had the recommended 2-3 cups per day. I've also started taking fenugreek capsules and trying to ramp up my pumping sessions. I have noticed a difference though and I am hoping to at least get back to my normal production if not increase it a bit as my 8 month old has been drinking more and more at daycare (now up to 15oz/day).<br /><br />I definitely think this tea can only be helping. Even if it is only a placebo effect anything that helps boost production is worth it. Also, I think it tastes great! Sort of a mild fennel/herbal taste. I usually make a cup, let it steep for at least 10 mins and then pour it over ice. It makes a great iced tea and I don't find it needs any sugar.

review/summary: It's a MIRACLE tea!!
review/text: THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS! After nine months of nursing, I had reason to start questioning my milk supply. My daughter's weight had plateaued, and I wasn't able to pump more than an once, so I was concerned that I wasn't producing enough for her. After just ONE day of using this tea, I noticed a very significant increase in my milk supply - so much, in fact, that I had to start pumping excess milk because my daughter couldn't keep up! I drink it only twice a day (the directions say 3-5 times daily) with a little honey and really enjoy the taste. I don't feel that it's too strong, like other have said, but I suppose that's a matter of personal opinion.  When I reach my goal of nursing for at least 12 months, I will have this tea to thank. I HIGHLY recommend it to any nursing women out there. I'm so glad I found it!

review/summary: Decent but acquired taste
review/text: I didn't seem to be producing enough milk for my son so I decided to try this tea based on a recommendation from a friend. It definitely has an acquired taste much like black licorice, which I don't particularly care for. However, it is bearable once you add a fair bit of honey. It's hard to say if the tea itself worked for me because in addition to the tea, I have been taking fenugreek capsules and pumping after each feeding. In all fairness though, I did notice my milk supply increase. Before this tea and the fenugreek I was only able to pump about a quarter of an ounce or a half ounce on a good day. After the tea and fenugreek, I noticed I was able to pump about two to two and half ounces per session. Not much but still better than before. If you can get past the taste or happen to like licorice, I'd say it's a decent product. Just be sure to add plenty of honey. If nothing else it's a nice tea to drink before bed.

review/summary: Amazing!!
review/text: I just picked up a box of this tea yesterday at GNC. My son is 2 weeks old, and isn't able to latch on, so I pump exclusively. I was only getting an oz at the most from each side, and he eats 2 oz every 2 hours. I was getting very discouraged about not making enough milk for him. I hated having to supplement him with formula, and it seemed to upset his stomach when I did. After drinking 3 cups of this tea yesterday, I was able to pump more than 2 oz from each side. I couldn't believe how quickly it increased my supply. The taste really isn't bad at all, its almost too bland. I could really care less about the taste, just care about how well its working. I would certainly tell anyone who is having supply problems to buy this ASAP.

review/summary: Mother's Milk tea, a great product
review/text: When my daughter was born, I wanted nothing more than to breastfeed her. So when I was told she was not getting milk from me (that my milk hadn't come in, probably because I'd had such rough labor and too many drugs), I was heartbroken. I continued to nurse her but also gave her a bottle and when I pumped, I never got much. I tried several different lactation support products (fenugreek, blessed thistle, and other supplements) and other than the fenugreek, this tea worked best for me. I am still nursing her two times a day and I drink the tea three times a day. I would highly recommend it to any mom who feels like they just don't produce enough milk for their little on.

review/summary: Wonderful tea for nursing mothers!
review/text: I purchased this tea early in the nursing of my twin daughters.  My milk took a few days to come in and with twins, I was instantly concerned about supply.  I drank this tea in the afternoon/evening and noticed an increased fullness on days I remembered versus days  it slipped my mind.  There was a lot going on at the time, to say the least!  The tea was actually just comforting in itself.  I'm a tea drink anyway so it was very relaxing as well.  I enjoyed the taste.  I think I would drink even if I was not nursing.  It does have a black licorice taste but I'm a fan black licorice.  Before I bought this tea, I remember reading a review which said just the increased fluid helps you produce more milk (and it does)....but I noticed a difference in my milk supply between the days I drank this tea versus just water.<br /><br />Bottom line, for me, I cannot say if this was the sole reason my milk increased but what I can say it helped me relax (which is huge), it made me feel proactive in my milk establishment, and I liked the taste.<br /><br />If your having trouble with your milk supply, its worth a try.  If anything, you'll get a few minutes to sit and sip some warm, comforting tea which is always a good remedy for the soul.

review/text: This stuff is just great!! It really, really helps bring on your milk supply fast! Here is my experience: I purchased this and put one box in my hospital bag, [along with Motherlove More Milk Special Blend tincture... ALSO AWESOME!]. I went into labor 2 1/2 weeks early and had had a c-section. My son went into the NICU for 36 hours and wasn't able to BF until 24 hours after being born. I started this stuff 4x day [along with the tincture 4xday] and my milk was pretty much in within 2 days of starting to BF [i was still in the hospital!]. Keep in mind though, hydration is key, so drink your water too - [sorry if this is TMI but for those who have a C/S birth and are really wanting to BF here's a tip:] i was chugging h2o while i still had my foley catheter in and that really helped bring in the milk too. ;) I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

review/summary: Keeps you hydrated
review/text: I am not sure if this tea possesses any magic powers, as far as increasing milk production, but it tastes good, considering the ingredients, and it definitely helps you keep hydrated throughout the day (the recommended dose is 3-5 cup per day). If you have no trouble drinking the recommended amount of fluids for nursing mothers, you probably don't need the tea. Personally for me, it makes it easier to squeeze all the fluid intake of the day if I mix it up with herbal tea instead of just drinking plain water.
