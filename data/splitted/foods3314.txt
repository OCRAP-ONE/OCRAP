review/summary: Yummy and horray for coconut oil!
review/text: I'm a huge fan of using coconut oil (check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)</a> The Coconut Oil Miracle for more info on the health BENEFITS of using this oil over other processed junk. I was thrilled to see they used coconut oil for this product (side note, the popcorn you loved and remember as a child from the theatre was made with coconut oil back in the day). It all popped up to perfection in mins with my new whirley pop and I ate more then 1/2 the container it was so great! I can't wait to try their kettle corn variety.

review/text: Looked forward to trying this popcorn. NOT IMPRESSED. I guess everyone has a different idea about what great popcorn is. And it's expensive, 5 packs for $10. We don't have one of those Whirly Pop pans like they always advertise. Used a large pot instead. Had to add more salt and oil. It was ok -- just not great. I will stick to making great popcorn right on my stove and much cheaper. I just use a heavy 3qt saucepan, add popcorn, salt, oil and butter all right in the pan. Much better than any of these store bought kits.

review/summary: Outstanding Popcorn!!!!!!!
review/text: If you like popcorn and are tired of the microwave stuff this is the best you can get. It's very simple and easy to make, just pour in the the kernels into a stove pot and mix in the supplied seasoning and butter mix, put a lid on top and in minutes you'll hear popping. Each bag makes a lot of popcorn which is nice and if you do it just right none of it burns.

review/summary: Strange coconut aroma
review/text: I recently tried the five pack Wabash "Real theater popcorn."  When cooking, there is a very off smelling aroma emanating from my popper.<br />So?  I tried Paragon popcorn oil in place of the Wabash product and had no more "smelly" issues.  Neither product offers much in the way of actual product content.  Hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated coco oil?  The latter better than the former....both not so good, anyway.<br />If you pop corn once in a while with Paragon + flavacol, you will not go wrong.  I wouldn't consume this combo very often, like maybe once or twice a month?.......by the same token, just like eating fat laden prime rib, potato chips, hotdogs, all the good stuff, is bad for your cholesterol lol.<br />Sadly all the snacks and fast foods we enjoy.....sucks.<br />C'est la vie.

review/summary: AWFUL
review/text: I did not purchase mine from Amazon, but I did base my purchase on reviews I had seen on both Amazon & another site, which were all glowing.  So I thought it was fair to give another point of view.  I love popcorn more than any other food.  This is possibly the worst popcorn I have ever had.<br /><br />Normally, I use canola or peanut oil, fresh locally grown corn, & sea salt.  It is absolutely delicious with very few hulls or unpopped kernels.  It is much better (& better for you) than microwave or any other popping method using oil.<br /><br />This stuff was stale, & had way too much sodium.  The coconut oil mixture was disgusting. The taste was so bad that I threw the rest of it away after a few handfuls.  I had split the original batch in half, & gave 1/2 to my neighbor, who usually will eat anything.  Even she thought it was poor quality.  Now I'm stuck with 2 boxes of this junk.<br /><br />I gave it 1 star because every kernel did pop, and the cooking time was quick.  But I'm going back to, & sticking with, my old method.  I think it must be the locally grown corn (FRESH!) that spoiled me.

review/summary: organic ingredients, dairy-free sandwich cookies; no pain with these
review/text: I'm glad I ordered these cookies. The package says, "wheat-free, dairy-free, not a gluten-free product; made with organic flour and organic sugar, creme filled chocolate cookies.".Cookies contain  a few other organic flours such as  barley, corn and rice--all organic.<br /> I try to remember regarding price that subsidies are not available to lower the prices of organic foods....why?<br />These cookies are nice and crunchy to bite into, and my first bite was a taste surprise...not quite like the usual chocolate sandwich cookie; so  I wondered at my wisdom or lack of it in buying these but THIS PASSED and by the third morning dunking these cookies in my coffee I was glad to have bought these Newman-Os.<br /><br />There is a poem printed on the package called "Ode to Newman-Os".<br />One thing I want to say:  while not a professional dietitian, I seem to be a walking, talking pain-gauge.  Newman-Os do not give me a pain.<br /> Other cookie products made with cheaper stuff such as regular cornflour or high-fructose corn syrup cause me almost immediate pain in the joints, so I have to avoid them.<br /> There is some literature explaining a rheumatoid-like influence upon humans by high-fructose corn syrup, so please don't take my word for it;  please read up !!!<br />I repeat:  great cookies!!  I find them helpful in switching away  from less healthy foods.  Once accustomed to the slight change in taste and texture, I've become  so glad to be able to get these.  Nice picture of Nell Newman and her dad, Paul Newman, too.  Hope you like these, too. Don't forget to read up on HFCS (high fructose corn syrup)...lots of info  available,  books, too.

review/summary: Wish I had not ordered them, can't return them...
review/text: I have purchased Newman's Own organic cookies before from my local grocery store and loved them. I have to say that it's my fault that I ordered these (the Wheat Free Dairy Free ones) as I was in a hurry and didn't read carefully. I also hate to admit this but I "assumed" (yes, we all know that that means, and yes I do feel like one...) that Amazon would stand by the products that they sell and allow returns. No such luck. Perhaps I've been spoiled by Trader Joe's who will take back a product if the customer does not like it.<br /><br />Needless to say these don't taste very well. My teenage kids agree and won't eat them either so now I am left with five unopened packages of cookies that are of no use and I can't return them. (sigh) The bottom line is that I need to read much more carefully and I don't think that I will purchase any more food items from Amazon.

review/summary: As Good as Imported
review/text: Now here's the thing, I'm a huge fan of imported Italian hard salami. As a sandwich meat, a pizza topping or appetizer, there's not much better as far as I'm concerned. Now domestic brands are a different story. My experience with them had been uniformly bad, until now. This Bridgford Hard Salami is excellent. Not just OK, but stands up well compared to any of the imported Italian meats I've tried. If you like salami, this stuff is the real thing.

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: Given the positive reviews posted, I thought I ought to give this sausage a try, particularly given the higher cost of salami I had purchased from other companies (Columbus Salame Company and Fortuna). The Bridgford salami was kind of a disappointment-fibrous and greasy with a somehow duller taste. Kind of like a Slim Jim with less heat and more sawdust (I'm not implying there is really sawdust in it-it just has a different texture that what I'm used to). My wife took a bite out of her slice, then put it aside and didn't nibble on it further... that is actually not a common outcome in encounters between my wife and bits of food. I did bake it with some cheese in some soon to expire canned pizza dough and it was pretty decent-my son really liked it. All in all, I'd say go a little upmarket if you are going to use the salami to snack on with fresh fruit, olives and whatnot but this product is probably fine for cooking.

review/text: Well, what can I say?  I regret this purchase of Bridgeford Italian salami (I didn't buy the hard salami).  The quality of the salami is just so-so, not terrible but not comparable in quality to slightly more-expensive salamis available at my local grocers.  The taste?  Not bad but not great either, a walk on the mild side (in other words, bland and a bit rubbery-tasting).<br /><br />Stick with Hillshire Farm, Genoa, Gallo, etc...Bridgeford makes good pepperoni but their salami is sub-par and not worth the money.

The texture isn't grainy like some of the more gourmet brands I've wasted my hard earned dollar on. Surprisingly it isn't very greasy, no gristle bits, no bitter aftertaste, and it smells good for a salami. Their use of salt and spices are well balanced. You could eat this with a sweet beverage and there is no conflicting flavors. Overall I rate this 5 stars and will be ordering this from Amazon again.

review/text: To be fair, I didn't purchase this product.  But I found it outside of someone's home as I was wandering the streets.  What I found to be exact was 3/4ths of one of the salami, in some sort of pet food dish as if left for a pet or some wildlife.  Well, since it was left outside, I decided that the owner might not care if I went ahead and ate it.  So I did, and it was wonderful!  I am only giving this product four stars since like "Mntijo" here with his review it was a bit greasy, and I also had stomach distress after eating it.  But this product is still delicious!  I do hope the owner of the home that placed this salami outside orders more, I'd love to get more free food of this caliber.

Mind you sugar and artificial coloring aren't the best things for you, but they make for fun times with food. Would I recommend you to buy it, sure would.

I have to say that all these health-related rules of thumbs are confusing, and you can find reports claiming directly opposite things, for example, isolated antioxidants (pills, basically) don't seem to do squat in humans (in petri dishes they do work). But when consumed as food they seem to work, and oregano is very rich in this stuff. And, all else aside, it tastes great, so this option here is clearly recommended, at least because it's cheaper than buying small jars in stores. I'm very satisfied with this product, and I will gladly reorder (assuming I live long enough to need a refill!).

review/text: OK, I confess, I'm a coffee junky.... with a budget!  Unfortunately, there are very few of the "affordable" brands that are even drinkable.  The Maxwell House BOLD, however, was a very pleasant surprise.  Great fresh flavor, rich and deep, without tasting burned.  Very nice overall.  I used it for both cone drip and espresso, and liked it for both.  Can't wait 'til they have a good sale on it again!

review/summary: The Best Colombian Coffee you can get - from Starbucks!
review/text: Having tried many Colombian Coffees including Specialties; there just isn't any that comes close to the one that my old Colombian friend who resided here for awhile while attending University and as Hospital Intern before returning back home; having tried Colombian Coffee from her own homeland. I just couldn't find anything that came closest except Starbucks Colombia which is only a Medium Roast Blend but close enough to what I had drank from what she bought over from her own Country in Colombia.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn from her she was disgusted here in "Americas" of what they had deemed as Colombian coffee when it was merely a mixture of this and that, showing me the labels; that was when I began to start reading coffee labels.  Furthermore, she even indicated that while they do grow coffee beans in Colombia, but a small percentage of them are actually pure Colombian. So much did I learn what the Colombians did, With her being gone, no idea if she has returned back to the USA or is stuck in Colombia. But one thing she taught me that I never had forgotten was "READ THE LABELS". I was even surprised by some of the expensive, imported 100% Colombian coffee were not, but rather a mixture of this and that with Colombian coffee being at the very bottom of the list! I guess the saying still rings true, "if it's too good to be true, it prolly is..."<br /><br />Not so with Starbucks Colombia Coffee!<br /><br />Whenever I drink this, I remember her brothers, her families, and of course her - whether I am at Starbucks or at home. To some, might find this rather strong, but I never use the exact dosage, I use less for that reason - for it is so rich and full of flavor, there is no need to waste it. I keep mine sealed, and yes, in a Freezer Zipped Bag to keep its freshness.<br /><br />I also use this for Iced Coffee as well during hot summer dog days of the months, it is refreshing.

review/summary: Starbucks Columbia Coffee
review/text: This coffee variety (Columbia) offers a nice alternative to the Pike Roast which the company uses as its default blend at their coffee shop locations. When traveling thru O'Hare Airport in Chicago I'm usually a customer of the MacDonald's for coffee, since the Starbucks in the United Concourse only dispenses Pike (except at seasonal times with Holiday/Christmas Blend). I keep the unopened bags in the freezer to prevent the ground beans from oxidizing.

review/summary: Best taste, best froth, organic, and reasonable cost
review/text: This morning I taste-tested 3 top-rated Matcha green teas that I recently purchased on Amazon.<br /><br />1. Serendipi Tea matcha culinary grade organic green tea from Japan, 4 oz. costs $17.43<br />(result: *****)<br /><br />2. Tea Zone matcha green tea powder, 8 oz. costs $16.99 (Amazon sells this as `Matcha Green Tea Powder By Malden Tea', but my black foil packaging label says it's made by Tea Zone)<br />(result: ****)<br /><br />3. Liquid Jade powdered matcha green tea 100% organic, 3 oz. Cost $18.46<br />(result: ***)<br /><br />Recipe:<br />I made 3 different cups of  `green tea latte' with the following method:<br />1 tsp tea powder,<br />mixed with filtered water into a smooth paste,<br />added to 1/3 cup hot soymilk + 1/3 cup boiling water + 1 tsp raw agave nectar,<br />frothed into a Latte-style tea with hand-pump device.<br />NOTE: I am a scientist.  Each cup was clearly labeled.  I tasted the teas side-by-side, taking 3 sips of each before proceeding to next sample.  I tasted in random order until all 3 cups were consumed.  Total time: 15 minutes.  I took lots of notes and drew graphs etc.<br /><br />Result:<br />Serendipi Tea (5+ stars)  won for sweet smooth flavor, amazing long lasting froth bubbles, and the fact it's organic!!  Cost: $4.30/oz but worth it.  Note on the packaging: For those reviewers complaining of the green tea powder leaking, I have to point out that it's hand packed, with a note explaining that you must pack it yourself in an airtight and light-blocking container.  Fine with me, since this is the best tea I've found, and the act of packing it myself is itself a ZEN moment in which I feel a connection to the individual soul who packed the brown bag by hand just for me.  You decide.<br /><br />Tea Zone (Malden Tea) (4+ stars) came in second for a very nice flavor, but the frothy bubbles popped sooner than the Serendipi Tea, making for a lower rating, and plus, it isn't organic.  But it gets extra points for its low cost:  $2.12/oz (can't beat it for a daily tea).<br /><br />Liquid Jade (3 stars) was an O.K. tea, ever-so-slightly more bitter than the other two I taste tested, and almost a chalky feeling (perhaps it was ground into larger particles than the other teas).  Yes it's organic, always a plus, but at a cost of $6.15/oz, no way will I buy this again when I can get TeaZone 4 stars for a third this cost, and Serendipi Tea 5 stars for significantly less money as well.  So long Liquid Jade (though I do love your container and I'll save it.)

review/summary: Excellent buy for organic culinary grade matcha!!!
review/text: This organic matcha is great for everyday use!!!  I will definitely buy this matcha again and again!  I put matcha in smoothies or make tea by the quart with honey.  Ceremonial grade matcha is just too expensive to drink everyday by the quart or to load up smoothies with it.  This tea has a good, clean flavor that is flavorful enough without being overpowering.  I have found it to be delicious in smoothies made with a fresh peach or mango, coconut milk, honey, ice, and a teaspoon of this matcha powder dumped directly into the blender.  It is a great way to enjoy the delicate flavor of matcha and the health benefits never tasted so good!  You are getting many times over the anti-oxidant effects of green tea from a tea bag because you are actually ingesting the tea leaves when you enjoy matcha. When making matcha as a tea by itself, less is more.  I use 1 teaspoon to a whole teapot of steaming (not boiling) water (but I enjoy strong flavors), then I mix in honey after it cools a little.  After my morning cup of matcha, I store the remainder of the tea and honey in the fridge for iced matcha later that day.  The flavor can be strong by itself, especially if you don't enjoy strong flavors, so it might be a good idea to start with smaller amounts (1/8 teaspoon or less per cup water) and work your way up to suit your individual tastes.  Experiment and enjoy!

review/summary: Best Deal Yet!
review/text: I drink a lot of tea, and over the years I have done my own research. Inevitably, I discovered matcha, its abundant health benefits and its ease of preparation. Few who are not avid tea enthusiasts or those who don't drink high quality teas for their staggering health benefits, or gift of wellness, might not favor the taste of matcha. However, for the majority, matcha honestly does not taste bad, and if you disagree, just add some sweetness to it, like some agave, honey, lemon, stevia, or sugar. You could even mix up the condiments to create your own nirvana for your taste buds. Anyways, through all my searching for organic matcha, SerendipiTea offers the best price, and consistent availability I've seen yet!<br /><br />Thanks SerendipiTea :)

review/summary: fine tea, unacceptable packaging (*updated)
review/text: Matcha is purported to have elevated antioxidant and cognitive benefits above standard green teas and was the reason for the purchase. The price is also correspondingly higher, and this brand was the least expensive with the most favorable reviews available on Amazon. This product was my introduction to matcha, and I was pleasantly surprised. It seems a more potent version of your typical, off-the-shelf green tea in just about every way. As a regular tea drinker, I can definitely see this becoming a frequent addition to the different teas I consume on a regular basis.<br /><br />The reason for the deduction of two stars was the packaging. The small box the tea is shipped in is small and relatively flimsy, but is sealed, which is not a big deal. However, as another reviewer testified, the plastic bag inside that actually contains the ground tea was not only partially unsealed, but I would estimate maybe a half tablespoon of powder escaped the bag's 'seal.' This is absolutely unacceptable. I don't care if you're shipping sand; any powder, let alone tea, let alone a finer grade of tea, needs to be completely sealed with an extraordinarily-high level of confidence that the bag is secure. I fail to believe this cannot be achieved within the boundaries of both successfully cost-effective and green packaging.<br /><br />As a broke university student trying to maximize dietary healthfulness on a restricted budget, I'd very much like to include matcha in my regular tea consumption, but I'm not sure I'll order again from this outfit. The unprofessional feel I experienced from this product was not insignificant.<br /><br />*****UPDATE - 10/13/11*****: I since reordered this product, and I was indeed surprised to find that any packaging concerns have been completely resolved. As in the pictures listed on the product page, the flimsy plastic the tea came in previously has been replaced by a thick, folded, brown bag placed inside a very solid tin - which I'm sure I'll reuse. The tea itself is fantastic and now it comes with killer packaging. Zero complaints about this product now; 5 big stars.

Once I add all the extra in, it's tasty. But if I use that much, then I might as well use the more expensive, authentic powder from Habiki-an.

review/summary: Not What I expected...
review/text: I'm new to matcha and now I understand why the "grade" matters. Not being a fan of warm/hot drinks, I use matcha for lattes and smoothies.  Initially, I used DoMatcha Organic Matcha (which I purchased here at Amazon)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019FOZC4">DoMatcha Green Tea, Organic Matcha, 1.06-Ounce Tin</a> and I loved it. I was surprised at how much I liked it because a number of reviews advised that the taste was acquired. When it was time to buy more, I thought I'd try Serendipitea since it was cheaper and the reviews indicated it was tasty enough for lattes and smoothies.<br />I noticed the difference right away when I saw the color.  Not a big deal, just not the same color - or fragrance.  Blending it was difficult.  It stayed clumpy and stuck to the sides of the glass mixing bowl even though I used the same method I'd used previously.  Once I got it blended, I added cold almond milk (I don't use milk), stirred, and added ice.  Blech!  Not a bit like that which I'd grown accustomed.  The flavor was pungent and new clumps sprung up that had gone under the radar when I blending. The really icky part was I inadvertently sucked a clump up my straw before I knew there were unblended bits in there!  Not wanting to waste, I used that failed latte in my smoothie. It was acceptable, but didn't add the taste and zip that the other brand added to my smoothie.<br /><br />I was going to go with 2 stars, but I figured I'd go with 3 since this may just be a matter of taste, rather than an issue with the brand.  As stated previously, I'm new to matcha so I took that to heart in my review.

review/text: I ordered this tea after reading about the many health benefits of Matcha tea, the healthiest of all Green teas.  I knew it would be dark green and milky- not clear and brownish as regular green teas.  But, I did not know that Matcha tea is actually green tea leaves ground into a very fine powder.  So, you do not need a tea infuser, but instead mix the powder with hot water and drink the actual tea leaves! No wonder Matcha tea boasts more of a health punch than green tea bags.  Now, in my opinion Matcha tea is not a pleasant drink.  It is thick and deep green, looking and tasting very similar to wet grass clippings.  I mixed the tea with honey and could stomach the first two cups, but the third cup made me gag.  Thankfully, this is a tea powder, so now I just put some in the blender with my yummy berry smoothies (yogurt, water, honey, ice, blueberries, other berries) and the grass taste isn't noticeable.  At the Amazon price of 38% off, this is an outstanding value for a whole 4-ounces of tea compared to other brands!  It is organic and comes in a recycled brown paper bag housed in a recycled box, along with an instruction card.  Arrived promptly in 2 business days as always with Amazon Prime!

review/summary: Bad packaging and bitter taste
review/text: I wanted to like this matcha because the price is so good. So when it arrived all split open and spilled in the box I told myself that was ok because it was cheap. When I took my first awful bitter sip I told myself just add more sweetener...and maybe some milk. But after a month of drinking this stuff I can't take it anymore! I just can't talk myself into enjoying the bitter taste no matter how cheap it is or how much milk and sweetener I add. I've gotten to the point where I don't even look forward to my morning cup of tea anymore. I'm still giving this 3 stars because it will work fine in smoothies or cooking where the flavor is more hidden (and it is marked as culinary so I guess that makes sense) but they really need to fix that packaging. And really if you're addicted to matcha you almost have to give this a try right? It's SO much cheaper and maybe the flavor won't bother you? As for me? I'm ordering the organic DoMatcha second harvest so I can enjoy my morning tea again.

review/summary: reasonable quality, good value but 3rd rate packaging
review/text: Overall the quality is decent but not in the same league of the DoMatcha products. The tea mixes reasonably well when I use a small hand-held frother though a bit of small and stubborn "clots" do persist. I use stevia to sweeten the brew and like the taste. Given the price point this does seem to be good value. The one big negative is the packaging i.e. the inner foil bag which holds the tea almost always shows up damaged inside the box you seen in the picture. There is definite wastage with the powder all over and around the foil bag. If they fix this one weakness, I would certainly give this product a 4 or 5 star rating.

review/summary: Good product, bad package
review/text: Like others have mentioned, the packaging of this product needs to be improved.  I have ordered this twice in the last few months.  The first order came in a mylar-type bag inside a sealed box.  The bag had broken open at some point so I had Matcha all over the place!  I decided to give it another try.  This time the mylar-type bag was inside a closed tin inside a sealed box.  I opened the box and Matcha was all over the place.  I opened the tin and bag was broken open inside.  PLEASE change the mylar-type bag to something more durable.  I most likely will not order this product again unless a change is made.  Too much wasted Matcha!

review/summary: Best deal for a great Matcha, for lattes, anyway!
review/text: We have bought this brand of Matcha 3-4 times now and are very satisfied.  It used to be $12 for a 4 ounce box, which is an amazing deal!  Especially for ORGANIC Matcha!  I see the price jumped to over $17.  It is still a fair deal, although, I obviously, liked the $12 price better.  This price jump did cause me to search out other brands.  But, so far, I still like this one the best, for the price.<br /><br />I am not a coffee drinker ...never had any coffee in my life.  So, I had no reason to go into a Starbucks, until my girlfriend got me hooked on their Green Tea Soy Lattes a few years ago.  We don't do dairy, so we get soy instead.  We also don't get their sweetener (melon).  We have found the vanilla flavored soy milk has just enough sweetener to make it addicting.  Anyway, we have been able to make good soy lattes at home with vanilla soy milk and the SerendipiTea Matcha.  It has a nice bright green color and full flavor, which I have found works well in the lattes.  Not all the other matchas had the same full taste.  Maybe that has to do with the type of matcha (i.e. culinary grade, ceremony grade, etc.).  Anyway, the SerendipiTea culinary grade matcha makes a good soy latte and is still very well priced.<br /><br />I just got some Matcha from Malden Tea, from Amazon.  The price was amazing, 4oz for $9.99, although it isn't organic.  It was more of a yellowish green color, not a bright green.  It has a more bitter taste, not as full and isn't working as well in our lattes.  I am going to have to order more SerendipiTea Matcha, and hopefully, they will lower the price again.  I would even buy in bulk if I could save more.  Bottomline, in our Soy Lattes, this Matcha is the best for the price!

review/summary: Yuk!
review/text: I started purchasing matcha about a year after they started selling it at Starbucks and Jamba Juice. live near San Francisco's Japantown and have tried several brands, varying in price from about $6 to $11 for approximately 1 ounce packages. I was happy to find what I thought was a great deal on Amazon, which with the subscription discount works out to less than $4 an ounce.  The package shipped quick, but as others have noted, comes in an unsealed package. I wouldn't freak out about that, but all things being equal, I'd have more confidence if the package was sealed. Bigger complaint is the quality is not up to snuff. It does not mix properly and tastes bitter compared to the matcha that I'm used to. I tried it twice (once with soy milk, another time with non-fat milk), and on both occasions it created a strange mixing effect, with the top half of the glass mixing nicely and the bottom half a murky mess that wouldn't mix properly. Both times the drink left me naueseous.  I don't claim to be a green tea expert, so I'm giving it two stars instead of one, but I've never had these problems with store-bought matcha in Japantown (or at Starbucks and Jamba Juice, for that matter). I would not recommend and have cancelled my subscription.

review/summary: Very high quality compared to most teas, easy to prepare, makes a great gift.
review/text: I bought this item for my mom for Christmas. It comes packed in a little 3"x3" cardboard box, sealed in a plastic bag. It arrived in the mail within a week to the DC area. It is a fine powder of deveined green tea leaves. Before I bought the tea, I read that this brand is mediocre (mediocre, not poor) as far as matcha goes. However, it is the best green tea I've ever tasted, and it's in a realm way above your average teabags you get at a coffee shop or grocery store. It's also relatively cheap: we made eight or ten cups of thick, frothy tea, and it barely put a dent in the box. The box cost about $12 when I bought it. Way cheaper than a coffee shop.<br /><br />This tea is easy to make. Just pour a spoonful of powder directly into a cup of hot water, and stir it in for a thick, frothy cup of tea. It's easier than tea bags.<br /><br />Overall, it is an excellent product and makes a great Christmas or birthday gift. I was very impressed.

review/text: A number of reviewers have complained about the matcha packaging. serendipiTea apparently listens to their customers, when I received mine the matcha came in a bag inside a green tin box which prevented any spilling. So don't let the negative packaging reviews stop you from buying this product.<br /><br />For first time matcha brewers, don't add too much matcha and don't use boiling water, unless you like your tea extra bitter. One level teaspoon per cup is more than enough.<br /><br />Delicious matcha for a low price, no more needs to be said.

review/text: I received the box and opened it up and green powder was everywhere! The bag inside the tin seemed sealed but there was powder caked on the directions. I brewed a cup and compared it to the Organic Eden brand I usually drink, which is a lot more expensive. The SerendipiTea Matcha was a bit bitter. The color and froth was fine but it had a very bitter taste. It's a bit messier to use than the Eden brand because the powder seems finer. As long as it gives me the health benefits of green tea, I'll drink it but I'm not sure I'd order it again.

review/summary: Great tea and packaging!
review/text: Other reviewers have complained of the packaging.  A card inside the tea box stated the following:<br /><br />"SerendipiTea packaging is 100% post-consumer-recycled material Kraft; the inner bag is sustainably-sourced compostable plant-derived material (Nature-Flex).  All packing is done by hand on SerendipiTea premises in New York.  For optimal storage, we strongly recommend that contents be transferred to an air-tight, opaque ceramic or tin container kept away from heat and moisture."<br /><br />Just to clarify the above statement, the exterior packaging looks like a cardboard box.  On the inside is a brown paper bag containing a sealed cellophane-looking bag which holds the tea.  It isn't possible for the tea to leak out of the bag or box unless the entire package is crushed.  My product arrived in perfect condition.  The tea tastes great and the packaging is earth-friendly.  I also like the fact that it's packed in the USA.

review/summary: Decent matcha for a decent price!
review/text: This matcha appears to be a good balance between price and quality.  I'm not a matcha expert but I have a couple months and several ounces worth of experience.  The matcha I was drinking before was $10/ounce which had good full flavor and was not bitter even when made strong.  I admit I've only used matcha to make lattes which is one reason for switching to something less expensive.  I've made about a dozen lattes with this matcha and I'm overall pleased with it. The flavor is comparable if not the same as the more expensive matcha I had but it is definitely bitter but if you're making latte with this it isn't a big deal since the additives almost ompletely overcome the bitterness.  I do have a somewhat weak stomach when it comes to green teas and the first couple lattes made me a little queasy (less than nauseous).  If you're the same way it might take a few to get used to it or enjoy it with a little snake.  This stuff is the way to go if you want to enjoy matcha daily without breaking the bank.

review/summary: Underwhelming, especially after trying DoMatcha
review/text: After enjoying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019FOZC4">DoMatcha Green Tea, Organic Matcha, 1.06-Ounce Tin</a> as my first foray into matcha and deciding to drink matcha each morning, I figured it was time to find a less-expensive alternative and chose SerendipiTea's matcha.  Organic, cheaper price, larger quantity, and positive reviews all seemed to indicate that it was a smart purchase.<br /><br />PACKAGING:  There's been some discussion as to the packaging of the SerendipiTea's matcha.  Inside a thin cardboard box is a heavy paper bag with the top rolled up.  Inside the bag is a thin foil bag containing the tea.  The box and paper bag are decent, but the foil used is extremely thin, and mine had several holes and tears that allowed a powdery dust to accumulate.<br /><br />TEA:  There's definitely a difference in color compared to the DoMatcha tea.  While DoMatcha was a bright, vibrant green, SerendipiTea resembled olive drab and looked sickly in comparison.  It tastes far more bitter compared to DoMatcha's smooth flavor...I kind of had to choke down the rest of my cup.<br /><br />On the bottom of the box it notes that this is CULINARY grade tea, not ceremonial grade.  I do not know if this accounts for the difference in color vibrancy and flavor, but I'm willing to bet it might.<br /><br />If you're planning on cooking with matcha or making ice cream/smoothies then SerendipiTea's matcha provides more bang for your buck.  However, if you're simply looking for a tasty brewed cup this might not be the most delicious option.  While DoMatcha was definitely more expensive, I think I'd prefer to pay the extra to get the quality and taste that's best for me, and in the meantime I'm off to find some good matcha recipes to use up the rest of my SeredipiTea!

review/text: While this is not the best matcha I have tried it is a good deal for the money. Compared to Domatcha brand the green is a little lighter and a bit more bitter so the quality is not quite up there with the other I mentioned. However, if you are looking for a cheaper matcha than this is good stuff for the price and by no means is it junk. This is a lot better than some of the practically yellow matchas I have tried in the past for not much cheaper. I have allergies and use green tea to control them and Domatcha brand is a little better but costs more.

review/text: This is a culinary grade matcha and I have used it to make doughnuts, blondies, cookies, ice cream and candies. A couple of tablespoons mixed with a bit of powdered sugar gives desserts a nice green tea flavor. I have only drank it as a tea once and it was a bit bitter. The product comes in a tin with a tightly closed paper bag which made it hard to use, so I transferred it into a plastic bag for easier access. Overall I would recommend this product if you are interested in making green tea desserts.<br /><br />Update: I have tried this again as a hot tea, this time using the correct temperature and method and it was not bitter. Although it was not the best matcha tea I've ever had, it was quite good once I learned how to prepare it properly.

Ceremonial matcha is $50-$70 per ounce , this is $5 per ounce , less than 1/10 the price .  Having said that , the quality for the price is excellent and its organic , which is nice as even some ceremonial is not organic.  The main difference is that this is more bitter than ceremonial.  I enjoy bitter and sour tastes so this is great for me.  Same health benefits as ceremonial , and thats the main thing for me , but I also very much enjoy the taste.

review/summary: Wonderful Flavor
review/text: I bought this to use in some homemade green tea ice-cream and absolutely love it!  Using this in the recipe gave me the delicious green tea ice-cream you get out in the restaurants.  Getting it to dissolve took a little time but not so bad.  Only complaint I had was when I first opened up the box, the inside packaging was unraveled and there was powder everywhere in the box.  That made for a mess to try and scoop some out.  Other than that I think was a great high quality product.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I drink green tea every morning instead of coffee, but I've always been a bit leery of trying the Matcha. However, after hearing about its many health benefits, I finally broke down and gave it a try. Delicious! The dark green color threw me when I was whisking it, but I was a convert from the first sip.  It's very smooth and flavorful -- and, it may just be the power of suggestion, but I feel a huge difference in energy levels and alertness during the day. I haven't tried using it in any recipes yet, but I think this would be awesome in an iced green tea chai soy latte, too.<br /><br />One word of advice: Make sure you whisk it thoroughly, or you'll have a little bit of sludge at the bottom where the undissolved powder settles.

review/summary: perfect
review/text: I finally decided to get this tea instead of other brands because of the price, even though I'd read some very negative reviews mixed in with the positive ones that made me wary. I made my first cup of this today and couldn't be happier. Some reviewers complained about the packaging. Mine came in perfect condition and was easy to transfer to an airtight zip-lock bag. Some reviewers complained about a bitter aftertaste. I found the flavor to be rich, fresh, and smooth, with not even a hint of a bitter aftertaste. I dissolved 1 tablespoon of sugar in 1/2 cup of water, heated it in the microwave and then whisked in 1 teaspoon of matcha. Then I heated 1/2 cup of milk in the microwave and frothed it and slowly added the tea to the mug of milk for an absolutely perfect latte. I haven't bought my own matcha powder before, but I have had green tea lattes from Starbucks and other such places and this is every bit as good as those. Especially for the price, I'd say you can't beat SerendipiTea's matcha powder!

review/summary: Great Matcha...clumpy when mixed
review/text: Tea tastes great.  I first started drinking this type of tea at Starbucks.  I then ordered some matcha from Nutsonline.com but didn't realize it had additives in it...but it did tasted EXACTLY like the Starbucks Green Tea Latte (they use matcha powder) except I wanted it all natural without any flavorings.<br /><br />I tried this and even though it tastes fantastic, it clumps...gotta find a way to make without the clumping.<br /><br />If I can get rid of the clumping then it's 5 stars.

review/summary: NO problems with packaging
review/text: I did not have any of the packaging problems<br />that a few others had.  My tea was sealed inside<br />a dark green plastic bag that was inside a tin<br />and it did not leak inside the tin.  I also took<br />the bag out and weighed it on a digital scale<br />and it was exactly 4 oz. just as they stated.<br />All in all, a VERY GOOD price for<br />ORGANIC green matcha tea.  I am very happy with it<br />(it tastes very good too.)

review/summary: Good flavor, poor packaging, will never order again
review/text: The package is terrible! My bag was split open and green tea powder was spilled everywhere! I lost 4-6 cups worth. It was a pain cleaning up that tea powder. I had to put it in my own plastic container. For $80/lb I expect better. Will never order this brand again! Not worth the trouble. It also took over a week to arrive, when I paid for regular shipping.<br /><br />I tried this plain, with only water, and it was smooth enough to drink. Normally I drink it in lattes. With Culinary Teas brand, I had to add vanilla and sugar to the latte to make it palatable. Even though this costs more than Culinary Teas, it is worth it. I still add a bit of sugar to the latte though. The packaging is terrible, some form of hippie foil bag inside a cardboard box. Every time you spoon out some tea, it spills and powder gets everywhere. The inner bag is not resealable neither. I wish they came in larger sizes, with a resealable container.

review/summary: Nutritional value and flavor vs price
review/text: Without a CSI lab, I don't know if the paler green of the culinary grade means less nutritive properties than the higher 1st & 2nd harvest brilliant green teas, but my money is on using less of the higher quality grades to compete with the value of this culinary grade.<br /><br />For culinary grade, it is a little more bitter than the higher grades, but is declicious in coooking and frappes.<br /><br />At the subrscription rate, it really is a good bargain.  Then again, if the higher priced brilliant green ryu-mei 1st and 2nd havest (grade 4 is good enough to drink as plain tea), means the nutrients are higher, I find myself using less quantity and feeling I'm getting the same benefits.<br /><br />Depending on how much I use, I will keep the Serendipiti Tea coming as a subscription, because it's affordable and I won't have to worry about running out of it.

review/summary: Great Cafe Grade Matcha Tea - Worth the money!
review/text: So many good things about this tea -<br /><br />1. Tastes good (and tastes like Matcha!)<br />2. Organic<br />3. Eco-friendly packaging<br />4. 4 ounce box for approximately $15 (AND GOOD QUALITY!)<br /><br />I was buying Matcha green tea for the first time and was unsure of whether to spend a lot or whether I'd like the taste of tea (in smoothies or in the traditional japanese style). I read reviews about DoMatcha, Matcha Tea from Matcha Source, Imperial Grade Matcha from Teavana but finally settled on SerendipiTea. This turned out to be a pretty good deal.<br /><br />When I'm ready to spend more, I might buy one of teas I mentioned above (pretty expensive compared to Serendipitea) and will buy those only for drinking 'Koicha'or 'Usucha'. I might also stock up on Serendipitea for smoothies.<br /><br />The first smoothie I tried was a simple one - milk, ice, 1tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp Matcha green tea all blended together and it tasted very good. It's my favorite now - for health reasons and for the taste. I'd definitely recommend this tea. If you opt in for the subscription, you'll save some more.<br /><br />P.S. In some reviews, I read about complaints with the packaging. However, it was not a big issue for me as I usually prefer to store tea and coffee in airtight containers. It is also not advisable to use Green Tea from its original packaging if the contents are not used within a month. Although I'm using the tea out of the original packaging and it's only been two weeks now, I intend on buying a beautiful, semi-transparent, decorative canister to store my green tea in.

review/text: This matcha tea is comparable to others I've tried, a little bit more bitter. Packaging is horrible. It arrived in a foil package inside a box, the foil was ripped in several places so I had a green powder mess all over the place, and a lot was wasted. Come on, they can do better than that considering what it cost.

review/summary: Good enough
review/text: This is a nice matcha tea to buy. I don't think the grade is what is claimed as the taste isn't consistently smooth. It is quite good quality though for the price, and I recommend that others buy this if a higher quality matcha is not withing price range. I think this matcha is better than others I have tried in this price range.

review/text: I'm no matcha expert, however do enjoy this tea. I can tell it's good quality, not some cheap pretend-green tea. It has mucho flavor, whether I'm making a latte or just plain hot green tea like you drink with sushi. packaging could be better but for the price and quality, I don't really care.

review/text: I know some reviews said that the packaging wasn't adequate, however I think they have changed the packaging. The tea comes in a sealed foil bag, in a paper bag in the box shown. There was no spillage of the tea. The tea flavor was great in a smoothie that I made. I was very happy with the tea.

review/summary: Cheap & Good
review/text: I'm no tea expert, but I am a Starbucks Green Tea Latte addict. I decided to cut back on the cost and make my own latte at home. This tastes virtually the same as the Starbucks matcha to me. The price per ounce is a bargain for an organic tea. Only downside is that you need to pack it in your own opaque airtight container after opening. The box is as shown in the picture, and inside you'll find a small brown paper bag with a thick twist tie thing to open an close it. And inside the paper bag is a small sealed thin foil bag with the tea.<br /><br />I add a teaspoon to my haagen daz vanilla,  make a green tea smoothies/shakes, Cakes/pastries, etc it's pretty versatile in it's uses other than for just your daily tea.

review/summary: Excellent Culinary-grade Matcha
review/text: I've been adding Matcha to my morning "smoothie" for several months now but have been looking for something a bit cheaper than what I've been using.  A search here at Amazon pointed me toward SerendipiTea Matcha, Culinary Grade.  It is perfect for my needs.<br /><br />When the box arrives, I open it immediately and put the contents into a canning jar--a rubber gasket-ed "Fido" style jar.  This does two things for me:  it gets it out of the shipping packaging but it also makes it easier to access on the fly.<br /><br />The flavor of this Matcha is as good as the non-culinary Matcha that I have tasted--at least for my "smoothies."  I have yet to try it in hot form.<br /><br />My only complaint about this tea is that it is not available for Subscribe & Save ordering.  In fact, as I write this, there is none is stock--a condition I hope is temporary.<br /><br />03/06/10 Addendum:<br /><br />Amazon has just added this to Subscribe and Save and I could not be happier.
