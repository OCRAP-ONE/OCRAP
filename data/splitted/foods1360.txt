review/text: Like others, I had a sticky surprise when I opened up my Amazon box.  A small amount of honey had leaked out, which given the price, wasn't welcome.  I also worry about ant access.  Be that as it may, this is a very good honey and I eat a spoonful of it most days.  I'm on the fence on the price/value equation but I certainly don't regret buying it.  I do hope they consider a glass jar for packaging.

review/summary: Disappointed in this first time Honey purchase
review/text: I thought I would try a different brand of honey from Amazon. The package arrived in tact in the box with no outside honey drippings as I had read in previous reviews, so I thought the purchase made it fine. However, upon opening the package, I found that both cans of honey were placed in a single plastic bag placed inside the box with no cushioning wrap around them. This did not protect what was in the plastic bag. Both cans crushed into each other in transit with one that popped open a leak in the top of the can, leaking half the contents out in the plastic bag inside the box. I was able to clean up both the cans, so I received a can and a half of usable honey for my purchase. Overall, the honey is ok, packaging is not good, so I was very disappointed in this purchase. For the price of this honey, I would suggest for anyone looking for a daily honey to use trying the Ambrosia honey from CO. Ambrosia Honey from Colorado is much better in taste, texture, price and packaging.

review/summary: Great product, just realize the implications of "bulk"
review/text: I ordered this in November 2011, it was a great deal then and an even better deal now, especially with Amazon Prime shipping. Yes, it comes in a garbage bag basically (not vacuum sealed) in a cardboard box. They save money and get you this great bulk deal by NOT individually wrapping it into 1 or 3 pound bags. So basically what you have to do if you're an average Joe home brewer is bag it up yourself into 3lb bags, that way it stays fresh. You can't just open the big bag and scoop out 4 or 5 pounds when you need it because unless you're brewing twice a day 7 days a week, the DME will absorb lots of moisture from opening and closing it so many times, and then it'll go bad. But it DOES come in good shape and it IS good quality DME. It just won't stay in great shape for super long if you leave it in their packaging. I brewed once a week with the stuff for... I don't know how many months, many, and I never had any problems. Just bag it up into smaller brew size portions and don't worry about vacuum sealing it, just try to use each bag fairly soon after you open them. It's a great product and it really made brewing affordable for me. Zeppelin Rules.

review/summary: What is going on with the packaging?
review/text: We just received one of these from Amazon after having bought Cooper's cans of ME here in the past without incident. Unlike the canned ME, which is just an OK deal, this is a better deal on dry ME per pound than I'd found anywhere, so naturally we were quite excited. It came shipped as a bag inside a Cooper's cardboard box inside an Amazon shipping box. However, the inner Cooper's box had been opened (it had been previously taped, and I cannot imagine why Cooper's would ship these unsealed) and the bag did not seem to be factory sealed, either. Rather, the bag was loosely tied in a knot at the top end, and the dry ME within the bag, just beneath the knot, was caked up inside the bag under the knot as if water had gotten into the bag. There was also some dried ME that had gotten wet around the outside of the bag by the knot. I'm posting this review to find out if others have had the same experience with this before I send it back (if I should bother demanding a replacement or not), but mine has been previously opened and exposed to water or other liquid, so I really cannot recommend this..

review/summary: Great sauce, but a bit pricey
review/text: I bought a bunch of these when Amazon was running a sale. I love the basil chicken (ga kra prao) that is served at Thai restaurants and have tried to replicate it myself with no luck. I am pleased to say that the sauce included in this product replicates it perfectly.<br /><br />My tip is to use ground chicken rather than sliced. One sauce packet goes perfectly with 1/2 pound ground chicken. I also prefer jasmine rice rather than the included rice noodles.<br /><br />Which brings me to the expensive part. If you do what I do, you're basically paying for a packet of sauce. And depending on how much you eat, and how many there are of you, that could mean multiple packets per meal.<br /><br />Anyway, to sum up, I recommend you give it a try using ground chicken and then decide whether it's ever worth it to buy it again.

review/text: This is my favorite "Asian food in a box" product.  Per the instructions, I add a half pound each of sliced chicken and fresh vegetables to the mix.  One box is plenty for 2 people and the flavor is rich, but not too spicy.  There is a different "Thai Pavilion Garlic Chili" product that is much spicier.  If you don't add meat or vegetables to this product, I can imagine how the spices might get out of balance.

review/summary: very good quality sauce
review/text: I found it very helpful to disregard the directions and simply put the noodles in a dish with water and microwave for about three minutes. Add sauce<br /><br />and eat. I find it to be a wonderful lunchtime meal.  Three people per serving??? I don't think so. I'm also 6'9" 265LB and can need an entire pizza at one sitting so I guess it's not the fairest criticism. I enjoyed the sauce because it's not a watery broth. The sauce is warm but not overpowering. For those that aren't accustomed to Thai food add peanut butter, yogurt, or sour cream, depending on the flavor. When I started out I threw peanut butter into just about everything hot. Also try drinking milk Instead of water.

review/summary: So good.
review/text: I've purchased this product numerous times at my local grocery stores, and normally it runs about $4 a box. That is a bit pricey for a sauce packet and some cheap noodles, but it is so convenient and tasty that I continued to purchase it until they stopped selling it.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't think I would eat this without adding at least one vegetable and one protein to it. It is not a meal in a box, but a meal building block. I would normally sautee some onion, chicken, water chestnuts, and asparagus spears, add the sauce, and noodles. It is also very good with chicken and snow peas. It would probably be good with shrimp as well.<br /><br />I am fairly particular about boxed food, I don't ever eat Hamburger Helper because I don't like reconstituted sauces. I find this sauce to be very good, however, and the convenience aspect puts it over the top. As far as the other reviews noted about the spice level, I do agree that it is spicier than I'd expect to come out of a box, but not overpoweringly spicy. I've had spicier dishes from many Thai restaurants, and I've never ordered anything over "medium" spice level. I'm not sure about the serving amount if you add nothing to it, but with some chicken and vegetables, it will serve 2 average eaters with no leftovers. I've never finished it all by myself. All in all, this is the best meal I've cooked (partially) out of a box. Although to be fair, I do most of my cooking from scratch.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: Seven reasons of yuck. AVOID!
review/text: I debated ordering these for months, then finally threw caution to the wind--I mean, I am not a food snob in the least and usually enjoy boxed meals like this. Unfortunately, it was a BIG MISTAKE. This stuff was horrible.<br /><br />1. The initial look? Disgusting. (See photo.) But I forged on because looks aren't everything.<br /><br />2. There were actual pieces of basil in the mix (see photo) but they were dark green/brown and barely distinguishable.<br /><br />3. The smell wasn't terribly enticing, either.<br /><br />4. The noodles--which they say take just 3 minutes--don't. I trusted that and they were still hard and not fun to eat. I could hear my TMJ-jaw cracking with each bite.<br /><br />5. The finished dish wasn't terribly appealing-looking, either.<br /><br />6. It said 1-2 servings but it was barely one. Maybe if you put three cups of chicken and veggies in it...but then the servings go up to 3-4. Ha.<br /><br />7. It was SPICY. Nose-running and lip-burning spicy, in fact. And not even a tasty spicy.<br /><br />I knew as I was eating it that the remaining five boxes are either being donated to the food pantry or going in the trash (Amazon doesn't take grocery returns). I can't see the addition of chicken and/or veggies helping out this stuff in any way at all. To the reviewer who said this is exactly like the Basil Chicken he gets in a Thai restaurant? Oh my, I feel bad if this is what he gets in a restaurant, and I'd suggest he find a new place.<br /><br />So please, if you think you REALLY want to try this stuff, please please please try a single box from the grocery store first--like I should have done and was originally going to do.

Our dog is a loving, docile pet, but regularly growls if we try to take it away from her...we give her 1/3 of a bone after each dinner meal.

review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS BONE, IT WILL MAKE YOUR DOG SICK.
review/text: I bought this bone for our 8 month old schnoodle. He loved it, and ate all of the inside 'meat' within two days. True, he shouldn't have been left to eat it so quickly but he also shouldn't have gotten sick. The day after he started eating this bone, he developed diarrhea with some blood for a couple of days. After a week, he is still having loose stool and yesterday he vomited twice. Otherwise, he has been eating his food and drinking water as usual and is playing like he always does so we have been trying to wait for his system to clear up on its own. Another couple of days of these symptoms and we'll be taking him to the vet. Btw, I did a google search on the Dingo brand for any cases of puppies/dogs getting sick and I found multiple hits where people were talking about their dog having the same reaction as ours did. I also found out that there was a recall on another type of Dingo treat 1 year ago. Please look for another brand of bones for your pet, better to be safe then sorry.

review/text: Dark chocolate is all about marketing and has little to do with quality. Chocolate connoisseurs know better but constitute a small fraction of the gourmet consumer base.<br /><br />Godiva chocolates are delicious and have a wonderful texture. They taste better than Sees Chocolates. Unfortunately, they just don't satisfy my chocolate craving.<br /><br />It's a shame what qualifies as chocolate here. In the US, dark chocolate must contain 15% chocolate liquor; European rules require 35% cocoa solids. American milk chocolate must contain 10% chocolate liquor; European standards require 25% cocoa solids. That means American milk chocolate is 90% not. No wonder those drug store easter chocolates taste so horrible.<br /><br />The ingredients of Godiva are far from top notch. At the prices they charge, it's a crime that Godiva uses artificial vanilla (vanillin), palm kernel oil, lecithin, preservatives, and artificial flavors made in some factory off the New Jersey Turnpike. I doubt real vanilla costs that much more per box of chocolates.<br /><br />Get a Valrhona pure chocolate bar (see other comments on where to purchase or buy conveniently from Amazon). They make one which contains 85% cocoa!

I would think that Godiva would have to same standards no matter how people order their products. I'm a very unsatisfied customer.

review/summary: disappointing and overpriced
review/text: Bought a 12-piece box of Godiva truffles at a brick-and-mortar bookstore. Priced at $25, but had a $10 off coupon. At this price these should be melt in your mouth delicious morsels of chocolatey goodness. Nope. Inside the chocolate shell is not a lovely, rich ganache, but a variety of ... I don't know what. Some are a caramel sort of stuff, some are this overly sweet, not so tasty white stuff. These are on par with what you might get cheap at a drug store. Actually, I even prefer Lindt truffles, which you can get three for the price of one of these.

review/text: I contacted the seller almost immediately after I ordered the chocolates to ask if they could leave out the receipt (let's face it - Godiva IS pricey. You get what you pay for, however) since the item was a gift to a friend. They responded to me very quickly and the package arrived well before its deadline. The chocolates were well received and thoroughly enjoyed, or so I was told :) I'd do business with them again, for certain.

review/text: These Truffles were delicious and the product was fresh on arrival. I have seen some comments where this product in particular was either old or seemed to be stale. Not in my case! Trade Concepts did an outstanding job of packaging the truffels and took great care to ensure the product arrived in superb condition. They put it in a special packaging material to prevent it from going bad in shipment too! I love Godiva Truffels and was so happy they arrived and tasted as good as I remember. Thank you Amazon, and thank you Trade Concepts for taking the extra care to get these wonderful little treats to me in pefect condition! Well Done!

review/summary: A Must For Chocolate and Strawberry Lovers
review/text: I saw these in a Japanese department store in Hawaii, and I wondered what they were.  I had recently started learning Japanese, so I decided to buy some.  I love them!  I happened to have a bag of chocolate-dipped strawberries, so I compared them to those.  Believe it or not, they taste almost the same!  These Apollo Strawberry/Choco candies have a natural taste; they're even fun to eat.  Buy some!

review/summary: Strawberry Chocolate Delight!
review/text: I didn't think I'd like these Apollo strawberry-chocolate candies because I'd heard they were kind of waxy. Still, I wanted to try them at least once, just to see for myself.<br /><br />And how were they, you ask? Delicious! It's true that the consitency is a little waxy, but it's hardly noticable. In fact, it's more creamy than anything. It's sweet, but not too sweet. The strawberry and chocolate flavors blend perfectly together. You get plenty in a box, too.<br /><br />I was pleased with the lack of saturated and trans-fat, too. It's 28g sugar for one box, which isn't too bad.<br /><br />The box design is very appealing, too. The colors and design are eye-catching. If you look closely, you can see that the strawberry seeds are actually done in gold foil. The mascot rabbit is also adorable. There are little riddles on the top flaps with answers on the bottom flap. They're in Japanese, but it's good practice for those learning the language.<br /><br />So there you have it- a tasty, attractive snack without all the fat. It's like eating guilt-free strawberry cream bon-bons! I'll definitely be eating this again.

review/summary: Wonder How Nasa Feels?
review/text: NASA must be pretty bemused that a Japanese chocolate is named after and shaped like their Apollo craft. It is amazing how things can be marketed using some completely unconnected with it. Having said that, these little Apollo shaped things are very good.<br /><br />They might strike one as being sickeningly sweet, but like most things Japanese, they are not. One would be forgiven for exercising caution, but I don't think they are overdone on the sweetness side.<br /><br />Combining strawberry and chocolate is an age old recipe, but Meiji have done it well this time. I thoroughly enjoy these whenever I can get them, but there are others that I would prefer. These, however, are more than good enough as a stop-gap measure for my real addictions.

review/text: These bite-sized chocolates are to die for! Easily my favorite Japanese candy, if not my favorite candy all around.<br /><br />They're far creamier than I'd expected. The strawberry flavor is amazing, and in no way artificial in taste!<br /><br />Comes in a resealable cardboard container, so it's a brilliant snack for those on the go who'd like something small.<br /><br />I'd highly suggest buying more than one, however, for two reasons:<br />1. THEY ARE ADDICTING! Do not be surprised if you wind up with an empty box far more quickly than you thought you would.<br />and<br />2. Each box contains roughly 35 (rather small) pieces. (1.5 servings according to the label.)<br /><br />If you can somehow get past their addicting nature, then disregard my warnings! =]

review/summary: Put  Wicks in Them
review/text: I recently ordered some of Meiji's limited-edition chocolate bars online and it occurred to me that perhaps Amazon carried them for less (they don't, at all). My quest led me to this product which not only looked interesting but had garnered reviewer raves as well. Today's errands took me past a Japanese grocery, so I made it a point to have a look for it (it's apparently a popular impulse purchase because it was displayed next to the cash register).<br />Given the positive reviews, I had high hopes. And if appearance is high on your list of priorities, then this is definitely your kind of snack because one thing the Japanese have nailed, in spades, is a visual aesthetic and these things are adorable, plus mine came packaged in a really snappy cardboard tube. However, while good looks are the top priority when it comes to boyfriends, my criteria for food are much less shallow and Apollo falls short of the mark.<br />I think the basis of the problem is that the Japanese, who produce a number of slammin' items (remember that aesthetic), have so far proved themselves incapable of mastering chocolate. I have yet to sample Japanese chocolate that isn't both waxy and short on the essence of chocolate flavor. This item is no exception, plus I don't find the strawberry flavor all that vivid (although to Meiji's credit, it's natural). And it really is easy to finish the container, but I believe that's due more to the fact that Apollo is sweet and innocuous, not that it's delicious. Perhaps if cocoa butter rather than vegetable oil had been the second ingredient listed, Apollo would suggest chocolate rather than paraffin, but who can say for sure? What is sure is that I won't be buying it again.<br />The bottom line: empty calories can be had more deliciously; save your quota for a more worthy goodie. I have no doubt that this review will earn me slams from fan boys (in addition to those guaranteed to turn up immediately, courtesy of obsessive liver-lipped Finnish ugly-boy troll stalkers), but I have to call 'em as I see 'em. 3.5 stars would be about right, but we can't assign by halves so 3 it is.

review/text: Most of the coffee tasted great.  Nice and strong like we like it.  The problem we had was the K-cups themselves.  They would cause our Keurig to "misfire".  It would take opening our machine, moving the K-cup a fraction over, closing the machine so it would "re-puncture" the cup and then brewing.  Then when we would reopen the machine, it looked like the K-cup had exploded.  And 9 times out of 10 our coffee would have tons of grounds in it.  Then today, my machine wouldn't even brew clear water.  So I had to completely take my machine apart TWICE and clean it in order for it to brew clear water.  Once it did, it was murcky water with TONS of grounds in it.  Then I just used my store bought, Green Mountain Sumatra blend coffee.  I will buy from Amazon again, but NOT these K-cups.  ONLY trusted brands!

review/text: After learning my lesson being stuck with tons of K-Cups I don't like, and needing something new in the morning, now that Wake Up Call has been discontinued, I gave this a shot.<br /><br />The presentation is actually really, really nice. I'd almost go as far as saying it would make a nice gift for someone who owns (or is receiving) a new Keurig, because everything is laid out clearly in a nice looking box.<br /><br />The coffee I received was a little different than what was in the picture. I didn't get Tree Hugger, or the Gloria Jean's coffees. I did, however, get three decaf K-Cups, which are pretty much useless to me. I used to keep a couple around the house just in case a guest came over who didn't drink regular coffee, but I literally can't give the stuff away.<br /><br />I could understand tossing a couple of decafs in to a flavor variety pack, but on an "Extra Bold" sampler? That's like getting sugarless gum in a box of chocolates.

He always buys Paskesz Spelt Cakes and after I read the one review of the Paskesz product, I found that the reviewer ordered that brand only because these Suzie's Spelt Cakes were out of stock.  Thinking that this person actually knew what she was talking about when she said how wonderful the Suzie brand was, I went ahead and ordered the Suzie spelt cakes and they are awful.  They have a very strong taste and they are vile - especially compared to the Paskesz ones I should have ordered to begin with.  Now I have 11 packages of this dry, tasteless, puffy spelt that I will feed to the ducks in my back yard when they start arriving in my canal. I hope I don't kill them.

review/text: We ordered these to use as a mix-in for ice cream. The price proved well worth it. The flavour is terrific, and they are a joy to snack on, though the rose flavour is a bit hidden under the coloring agents and sugar. The texture stands up to the freezing process, and added a nice crisp to the smoothness of the Days of Wine and Roses sherbet(a rose sherbet base with the candied roses). I'm certain these would stand up very well to use as a cake decoration, especially since most frostings are less liquidy than ice cream is.

review/summary: A Great Product
review/text: This is an item you aren't likely to find at the local supermarket, so being able to order it over the computer is a huge time-saver. The package holds a large quantity of rose petals, and is tightly sealed to be unaffected by humidity. The rose petals are a lovely pink color and, though many of the pieces are small, there is enough variation to allow a cake decorator to create blossoms of the size he/she chooses. A wonderful bonus is that the rose petals are as delicious as they are beautiful.

review/summary: Expensive (more than list price!)
review/text: The coffee makes a pretty good shot of espresso, and although I once got a tin full of loose grounds, Amazon was quick to ship me a replacement set.<br />However, the current price (over thirty dollars for two tins), IMO, is much higher than what you can find at other online coffee retailers, where the newer tins with individually wrapped pods sell for twenty-five per 2 tins.

review/summary: Illy ESE espresso pods are easy and convenient to use
review/text: These Illy ESE (espresso easy serving) single-shot espresso pods are easy to use and convenient. All you need is an ESE adapter for your espresso machine. After brewing your espresso, just shake the pod out of the holder, and you're ready to brew another. Use two at once for a double shot.<br /><br />The quality of the espresso from the pods is as good as ground coffee. But you trade off convenience for price. Buy these if you just make an occasional cup of espresso, if you are always on the run, or like to make several espresso shots in succession, for example, when you entertain.

review/summary: Bad batch of Pods
review/text: I also have an ESE pod espresso machine. They came with the illy pods, we tried them and they are always a great brew, every time and consistent. The one's we bought here apparently were bad, all I got was the tea like water also, no coffee. Upon calling Amazon found out they had a bad batch, so tried the dark espresso pods and no problems. After reading the first post on the tea like coffee and the user trying to figure out what they were doing wrong, it wasn't them at tall, it was bad pods. I would recommend them in a heartbeat! Hopefully they've gotton this issue taken care of. Also users who are new to the whole "pod" thing, make sure you are using the right filter basket for pods and not ground coffee if your machine does both. Hope this helps!

review/text: Illy Cafe Medium Roast ESE pods is still my favorite with a strong fresh ground & unburnt taste. I have tried Starbucks, it has a burnt taste (common with dark roasts). I also use Lavassa Gran Crema ESE pods which comes in a close second with it's nutty aftertaste & very good crema - better & more consistent than the crema from Illy's.<br />It's very high cost is the only drawback.

If you prefer a REALLY dark and smoky shot, try Illy's 'Tostura' also sold here on Amazon. For most of us, this medium/dark is delicious. I've used them in my Francis Francis for years.

review/summary: Great Espresso
review/text: I've gone through 3 tins of this espresso and have found it to always be great.  It has a mild flavor.  I have noticed that it tends to get either really good reviews or really bad reviews.  The bad reviews tend to be because people are not able to get a good brew from the pods.  I have a Krups espresso machine that is designed to work with e.s.e pods and I consistently get a good brew.  Perhaps some machines don't work well with this brand of pod.  You might try it and if it works well for your machine, you'll love it.

review/summary: Cheap, easy and actually pretty good espresso!
review/text: So, I'll start by saying I'm sort of an espresso snob.  I got an espresso machine after spending 3 days on the internet checking out the best ones and ending up with a great deal on a Francis Francis X3 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AFX4B">FrancisFrancis! X3 Espresso Machine, Black Matte</a>.<br /><br />I was wary of the pod idea and couldn't imagine getting real espresso from an air packed pod of really old espresso.  Francis Francis had a canister to try in the package, so I broke down one day and just tried it.  I must say, it was actually really good.  The canister was a little old so the espresso was a little bitter but it had better cr&egrave;me and consistency of most any of my pulls.<br /><br />The Francis Francis machines are made for pods so I just put the little guy in and turned on the machine.  Clean-up was easy, just pull the side paper and throw it away.  I didn't have to wipe-up espresso dust off everywhere, clean espresso off the machine...nothing really.  Not to mention the price of these little things is much better than having to pay for ok/horrible espresso close to home or pay outrageous amounts for shipping. Also, Lilly makes many different varieties of espresso like medium, dark, decaf, etc. (not sure about other brands, I've just stuck with Lilly)<br /><br />So, in conclusion, I've converted... I'm a closet pod user and the ease of use and the fact that I can get 36 pods for less than a dollar a piece is great for me.

review/summary: Good, with a bit of work
review/text: I have a basic Cuisinart espresso machine that I normally use with Starbucks espresso pods. I saw the Illy tin at Wegman's and decided to give them a shot (no pun intended). Unfortunately, what I discovered is that these pods -- as is -- do not work with my espresso machine. The resulting shot looked like tea. I was somewhat annoyed as the tin doesn't say much of anything that is helpful, but what I eventually tried was cutting the excess portion of the wrapper off so that it looked exactly like a Starbucks pod. It worked perfectly and produced a great shot with lots of crema.<br /><br />I am drinking my latte now, and while it is good, I wouldn't say it is any better than my normal Starbucks-pod lattes. As the Starbucks pods are much cheaper (and easier), I'll be sticking with those after this tin.

It was a bad leap!<br /><br />As this cooked, it had a strange odor. It smelled like a barnyard (if you've ever had cows or sheep or goats, you know what smell I am talking about!) when we ate it, it had a taste similar to the barnyard smell. I realize it's probably the peppercorns....but yuck. Yucky yuck. It had no redeeming flavor at all. I have been slowly giving the extra packets away, so far no one has said they want more of them.<br /><br />Normally I would love something like this but...this was bad. Very disappointing.

These are a great size to satisfy without overdoing it.  And they are especially crunchy so the pups really enjoy them.

review/text: Dog loves them.  Molly is small so I have to cut treats to more manageable size, but bag will last longer! They are made in China..wish I had seen that.  It is a concern, but I've only read that chicken jerky from China is the problem...I hope.

review/summary: Love! Love! the AKC Duck and Spinach Dog Treats
review/text: My Yorkies love the AKC Duck and Spinach Dog Treats.  They are bone shaped and the perfect size and not a choking hazard.  My babies have allergies and they cannot have Chicken or Beef.  They LOVE this product.  I went to reorder and it is out of stock.  Amazon, please restock!  I cannot find these anywhere.

review/summary: AKC Duck Jerky Dog Treats
review/text: I was not satisfied with the Duck Jerky that I purchased from American Kennel Club for my dog, all 7 bags were dried out and brittle; one was so dry it was all most white and I ended up tossing that one in to the garbage. The Duck Jerky you get from Wal-Mart is at least moist and chewy. I am not happy and neither is my puppy (tough chewing).

review/summary: so hard you have to hammer it to break it up
review/text: These treats are so hard that I have to take a mallet out on a hard floor with a newspaper to break them up to give to my dog.  I would not buy them again.  My dog is a chewer, but these have no appeal to him unless I break them up first.  And he LOVES duck treats.
