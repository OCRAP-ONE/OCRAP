review/summary: They Changed it!  It no longer has the Vitamins it used to!
review/text: I had to swear off coffee for health reasons - and chocolate too.  Arghhh!<br />But Ovaltine Malt in hot milk made me feel like I wasn't completely sacrificing.<br />And the vitamins and minerals made me feel OK about adding all that sugar to my diet.<br />NOW - - they've changed the recipe!  It used to have about 3 times the vitamins - especially B's - that it does now!<br />I had noticed a change in taste - it wasn't as rich - and clumped up more.<br />Then I looked at the label.<br />WHY?  Another very disappointed fan.<br />It's like the new coke thing.  Somebody screwed up - and they will be losing lots of loyal customers, like me.

review/summary: Malted Delight
review/text: There is no question that kids would honestly rather try to put chocolate syrup into their milk and have chocolate milk. Yet, that has gotten old after awhile, and kids don't honestly get enough in the way of taste. Fortunately, there is another option for taste, and that is Ovaltine. It is a great Malt mix that is simple and easy to mix into your favorite glass of milk, hot or cold. The taste is absolutely delicious, in each and every cup and has extras like vitamins and a extra dosage of calcium which is something other mixes like Quik from Nestle don't often display in their drink mixes. I absolutely recommend Ovaltine as a great buy in your grocery cart anyday of the week.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+

review/summary: I Might Have Liked This Better If I Had Ordered It
review/text: I ordered the chocolate version; but got this.  Twice.  Now I don't exist when it comes to the Ovaltine topic.<br /><br />You might like to read my review under the Ovaltine Chocolate Malt Drink Mix.  I had to review that without having even tried it.  Why?  That review outlines a tale of Amazon arrogance that shouldn't be.  Usually I like the Service I receive from Amazon; but they really dropped the ball this time.<br /><br />To make a long story short, they don't seem to want to send me the chocolate.  They simply sent the wrong Ovaltine.  Shouldn't be a big deal, right?  Well, it does become important when the customer is ignored.<br /><br />I can't understand why, after a nice attempt at making it right and failing, now they won't even respond to my question.  Even after painstakingly trying to explain the problem to them.<br /><br />What?  Say it ain't so, Amazon!  I'm a darn good customer, if I do say so myself.<br /><br />I'm supposed to accept what is delivered, whether I ordered it or not?  I might have; but the deafening silence (which I consider arrogant stonewalling) just doesn't make me feel generous anymore.<br /><br />OK then, I'll review this.<br /><br />Lots of sugar; but a decent malt flavor.  A nice change of pace when added to milk.<br /><br />But, golly, I sure do wish I had some of the chocolate flavor for a comparison.<br /><br />ADDENDUM<br /><br />Well, I still haven't tasted the chocolate; but I thank Amazon for refunding my money.  They say they found something wrong with the product.  Maybe it just wasn't there?

review/summary: WOW!
review/text: I very rarely write reviews, however, this is the best thing I've found on Amazon. This is the real deal and the only way I can get fresher lobster is to go to Maine or order live lobsters, which is what I usually have to do.  Not only is the lobster fresh, tender, and extremely delicious, but the seller is exceptional as well. This seller knows what customer service is and that is rare these days (especially online). Lobsters were shucked yesterday afternoon, shipped overnight (for free), and I had them by lunchtime today. How nice to not have to deal with the mess of shucking the lobsters myself! Maine seafood is the best seafood in this country in my opinion and I will be buying it from Cape Porpoise often. I can't wait to get some steamers!

review/summary: Fresh rather than frozen!
review/text: Is this product frozen? I thought so because of the amount of water surrounding the lobster. But i was wrong. You do get plenty of lobster meat, mainly tails and some claw meat. I appreciate the work invoved in picking the meat from the shell etc. The delivery and packaging is excellent, but I want fresh lobster.  I also know how easy it is to overcook lobster even marginally.<br /><br />I ordered more of this lobster, after discussion with the vendor, and no I did not get it free. This time the lobster was excellent, very tender, and with less water surrounding it. I conclude that it is fresh not frozen.

review/text: This is a great way to drink water and get the extra protein you need throughout the day. I'm a bodybuilder so taking in protein throughout the day is very important. Any active, younger, older, person will benefit from this. It can be somewhat "gritty" but as long as you shake it REALLY well, it will fully resolve. You may notice some residue on the bottom of your cup but that's not an issue. I recommend using the product with a blender bottle or something that has one of those metal wisks that can really shake it up. Won't yield very good results if you just pour it into a glass and stir with a spoon- but it will work.<br /><br />Taste is great and overall a great product. No one beats Amazon's price on this.

review/summary: Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on
review/text: This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own "stand" in order to fill it properly.

review/summary: This filter works PERFECT!
review/text: Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the "old fashion way" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!

review/summary: Ekobrew Washer Hack
review/text: When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16" thick, 5/32" inside diameter, and 3/8" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.

review/summary: Good Product and Excellent Customer Service
review/text: At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.

review/summary: great design
review/text: Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: This one is well thought out - perfect in every way!  I threw my old "My K-cup" out in the trash.  Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little?  Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly.  I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says "some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.  You have to move a small gasket down each time you switch between your K-Cups and your My K-Cup.  We don't have a new My K-Cup that works - so you need to just use this "work around" for the time being."  Now with my Eco-Brew - problems solved!  That's because it's the exact same size as the K-Cups!  No more changing the adapter in and out.  It works better too!  Coffee is stronger!  No more "hole down the middle" with weak coffee and wasted grounds that were never used.  Whoever designed this was a genius..... and too bad for Keurig they didn't think of it!

review/summary: AH-MAZING!!
review/text: WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!

review/summary: Techno-BEST
review/text: My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.

review/summary: Excellent brew, economical too!
review/text: With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!

I bought it to put in coffee, in case I ran out of fresh milk or soymilk.<br /><br />I cannot tell the difference! It is enriched with vitamins and minerals, and the children's version is even better enriched with significant amounts of 19 vitamins and minerals, with a little more sugar and less fat.<br /><br />One caveat- this product is NOT fat-free, as Amazon.com states here. That would be too good to be true!<br /><br />I keep my Nido in the cupboard right next to the K-cups(coffee)and honey in my cupboard. What could be simpler?

They don't exactly rehydrate in tea, but do get a little moist and chewy. Overall I think these berries will be a regular purchase for me.

review/summary: "Organic"?
review/text: I am not convinced this product is organic and will therefore not buy it again. The packaging on this product leaves me wondering how organic "Healthyway Organic Goji Berry" really is. There is no independent verification authority to confirm that this product is really organic. As far as I can tell, it is not certified organic by any authority other than the supplier and distributor A&D. I contacted A&D and they said it is certified organic by the EU. They did not however provide any evidence of this. Leaving me to wonder if this product is really organic or not. The 'Nutrition Facts" on the label have some strange entries like "Quantity of Heat" and "Thick Protein" which I do not understand. They sound like direct translations of Chinese to English. It is a "Product of China" as are most goji berries I have seen. My concern at a time when there is so much bad publicity related to food products coming out of China is that this product may be "organic" in name only and not in fact. I will eat the pound I bought and hope that it is truly organic as A&D claims.

review/text: My package looked almost exactly as on the picture. Great quality with no dead moss.<br />Ok, this will require your attention.<br />Before you buy this, as well as any type of green moss, you have to make sure it is either kept near by the water or just being sprinkled 3-4 times a day (at least in NYC). It WILL take some time for the moss to get rooted and used to your soil. Too High/Low PH might kill it. While adapting, the moss will partially get brown, it's ok. If you do not water it properly, it will most likely die. So take a good care of it and you'll be all set. And DO NOT USE ANY FERTILIZER, you will kill it.

If I eat cereal for breakfast, even the good cereals like corn flakes or cheerios, I see a sudden spike in blood sugar and usually get tired at around 10 or 11am.  These Nature's Path Cereals, this one and the granola, are the only cereals from which I experience absolutely no negative effects.  Because of the natural ingredients, pumpkin seeds, flax, etc. this cereal does not immediately turn to sugar for the body to process.  Instead, it leaves you feeling full and energized for a long time.  They taste incredible too; seriously, I prefer this over regular raisin bran or whatever you'd compare it to.  Strongly recommend!

review/summary: Best high fiber cereal out there - period!
review/text: This cereal is special and I highly recommend it.  I need to eat a high fiber cereal each day in order to stay healthy and this cereal has 7 grams in a serving (a serving is 3/4 cup, I believe).  I have been on a quest to find a great tasting high fiber cereal and I finally found it! I used to eat Kashi Go Lean Crunch and Fiber One Honey Oat Clusters but this cereal tastes so much better! The flakes stay crunchy in milk.  The raisins are very chewy (which makes the cereal seem more substantial) and they have some special coating which makes them taste wonderful.  The little seeds in the cereal taste great.  There is not one hint of the "cardboard" taste you find in other high fiber cereals, such as Fiber One or All Bran.  I sometimes put fruit on the cereal, but it does not need fruit to make it taste good, as it is a little sweet already. I eat this every day and never get tired of it.  It's very expensive in stores and Sam's Club won't carry it where I live. The price I'm seeing today ($9.42 for 3 boxes with Subscribe and Save option) is cheaper than my local Wal-Mart's price.  Sold!  The only negative thing I have to say is that one time I got a box that had fewer raisins than usual (from Costco), which disappointed me, but that happened only one time out of probably 20 boxes, so it was just an anomaly.  Usually there is about one raisin per bite (or a little more).  Enjoy.

review/summary: Went bad too soon.
review/text: Nature's Path makes very good cereals. I no longer eat them, since I'm gluten-free, but this was one of my favorites. The major problem for me was that I didn't eat it fast enough. Flax goes bad if it isn't stored in the fridge or freezer. By the time I'd gotten to the 3rd box, the cereal tasted rancid - even though it wasn't near its expiration date. I don't know if it was a bad batch, or it got too warm in the warehouse, or during delivery, but I've never had that happen before with other cereals. The cranberry Nature's Path cereal I bought at the same time was fine. Maybe this one isn't so good for buying in bulk?

review/summary: Hard Raisins!
review/text: Very good cereal.  Without adding sugar, it's got a very earthy, woody taste.  I add sugar and it is devine!  The only reason I took off one star is that the raisins are harder than diamonds!  I now take them out before adding almond milk so I don't accidentally bite one and break my crown.  I ordered the 3 boxes from Amazon in June and the expiration date is 7/29/10 so it could be that it is just old cereal.

review/summary: Wonderful cereal
review/text: My husband and I love the Nature's Path Flax Plus cereal line, but we had never seen this one before.  It has now become our favorite.  The flakes are the same as in all this line of cereal, very hardy and full of flax.  The addition of pumpkin seeds and raisins gives it a wonderful flavor and an extra crunch. Not to mention the high fiber count!  If you like a cereal with more than air in it, this one is for you!

review/text: Not a bad cereal or a bad option, but it's a misnomer/hyperbolic name for a cereal...there aren't many pumpkin seeds or raisins, and the crunch comes from the relatively bland bran. Canceled my S&S immediately; wish I'd tried one box before I sprang for 6.

review/summary: STALE CEREAL, KEEP AWAY
review/text: I used to eat this often when it was sold in my local Costco. Now Costco sells the granola variety. I ordered this from Amazon. The packaging (at the bottom flaps you will find this) says 06/08/09 and the use-by/expiration (on the top) says 08/03/2011. I purchased this in May 2011. Close to expiration. Definitely stale by the dates as well as by the taste. BAD QUALITY CHECK on part of Amazon? Selling expiring stuff at lower price? I THINK FOOD ITEMS SHOULD HAVE PACAKGED DATE AND EXPIRATION DATE, AND WHEN SELLING (ESP IN BULK), AMAZON MUST LIST THIS INFO ON THE PAGE (AT LEAST A RANGE OF DATES OR WHAT ONE CAN EXPECT).

review/summary: So delicious and fiberful, you must be careful
review/text: This cereal tastes like raisin bran crunch and yet it is much much healthier.  The addition of flax seeds and pumpkin seeds really ups the nutrition.  It is a carb, however, so those of you on low-carb diets might want to avoid this (although it is so tasty and healthy, I don't know why you would).<br /><br />A word of warning.  This is so delicious that you may feel tempted to eat 2 or even 3 bowls of it.  However, you must remember that this is a high-fiber cereal and unless you want to be riding the porcelain bus for a while, you should probably restrain yourself and just stick to one bowl.

review/text: I really like the flavor, health factor, and value of this organic cereal.  But it contains these incredibly hard bits that do not soften in milk and hurt my teeth and gums like no other food I have ever eaten before.  I actually had two of my molars spread apart by this cereal, which take a long time to heal, with weeks and months of rest between another atempt to eat this cereal, it happend again every time.  And the raisins are also very hard and chewy, which tires out your jaw and makes you wonder to yourself if you are ever going to finish this cereal before lunchtime.

I've been eating this cereal 6 days a week since originally ordering it, and it's still fantastic. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Great cereal!  Convenient way to purchase!
review/text: I became a big fan of Nature's Path Organic Flax Plus Pumpkin Raisin Crunch Cereal after purchasing it at Sam's Club several years ago.  It came in a 35 ounce box so I didn't have to keep going to the store to get it.  Recently Sam's quit carrying this product, but I don't know why.  I could buy it in the grocery store, but it was only a 12.35 ounce box.  When I realized that I can get three 12.35 ounce boxes from Amazon and set up a schedule to have it delivered regularly to my door, I jumped at the opportunity.  Best of all, there are NO shipping charges when you sign up for this program.  I love this cereal because it is FULL of fiber which is healthy for the body, but just as important, it really tastes great.  I guess you could say I am addicted to it.  Whether you choose this cereal or another one, be sure to sign up for the regular delivery (you choose the frequency) program.  It is great! Oh, the Amazon price is also very good and competitive with grocery store pricing, although without the tax!

review/text: I had some delicious pumpkin cereal that I bought at a gourmet market last fall. Since it was a seasonal item, they no longer have it. Hoping this was similar, I took a chance. It is not pumpkin-y at all. I guess the "pumpkin" comes from adding pumpkin seeds to tasteless raisin bran. This cereal also has a lot of calories, about 220 per serving. That's pretty high compared to tasteless raisin bran. Now I have 6 boxes of this stuff. What to do?

I paid $7.87 yesterday at Sam's Club for 35 oz box.  Had it for breakfast today.  Checked the box cause it seemed maybe stale.  Said best if used by Feb 16, 2011.  That is less than two weeks away from purchase date. Raisins are indeed like mini hockey pucks.  You could easily break a tooth on this cereal.  I wasn't crazy about the flavor.  I'll probably try it a couple of times more, but I doubt I'll like it enough to buy it again.

review/summary: ...and carrots
review/text: Not a bad soup...if you like carrots.  Which I don't, and which the packaging and product description in no way indicates.  So, be forewarned, this is chicken noodle soup with mini noodles AND carrots.

review/summary: Good, but noodles at bottom
review/text: The soup is really good, but the noodles all end up at the bottom which makes it feel more like chicken broth.  Still pretty good.

review/summary: spills everytime
review/text: Every time I heated this particular soup in any microwave, the container made a popping sound and popped up off the turning tray, fell over, and spilled out.  If you can catch it before it spills over completely, you will find when eating that the noodles all gravitate to the bottom and you are left with a very untasty,pasty noodle mash at the end of the serving.

review/summary: Marginally edible, arrives damaged
review/text: This soup can best be described as edible, and nothing else. Filled with tasteless orange carrot bits, tasteless noodle bits, with none of the general good taste of plain old Campbell's Chicken Soup.<br /><br />Further, the way these are packaged by Amazon is absurd; the package does not have a hard top, so any weight coming down on these is going to come down on the soup containers themselves. The soup containers have a flimsy, flexible plastic top with will not stop anything, and in the end the weight comes down on the peel-off product seal. Result? Leaking, exploded soup everywhere.<br /><br />Mine arrived with three soup cans exploded, which I realized only after seeing soup leaking out of the still-sealed box from UPS. Even better, the soup was all over several other items that were in the same box.<br /><br />Would not buy again.
