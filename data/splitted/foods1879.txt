review/summary: Don't Waste Your Money
review/text: This was actually a free sample, and thank goodness because I would not want to spend money on it.  Let's get one thing straight here, I love tea both iced and hot.  I also love the flavors of mango and pineapple.  But this version of instant tea from Lipton is not my idea of tasty.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Convenient single-serve packet.  Stir it into a glass of water or shake it up in a bottle of water.  Goes with you for whenever you're ready for iced tea.<br />- No aspartame or asculflame K<br />- No artificial flavors or colors<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Contains sucralose<br />- Not a good overall flavor<br />- The sucralose tickles and irritates my throat<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />While the pineapple and mango flavors are certainly prominent, there is absolutely no green tea flavors my taste-buds recognize.  To me, it's like some kind of cheap drink mix.  Judging by the taste, it's hard to believe it's made with natural flavors!  It has a chemical taste to it that I cannot stand.<br /><br />I do no recommend this drink mix.  It sounds good and seems like it would be okay (aside from the sucralose), but it's bad.  I cannot even finish my one glass.  Sorry Lipton, but this product was a flop.  I'll stick with your hot teas.

review/summary: Great fake jerkey!
review/text: This is a great substitute if you're vegetarian. The problem is, when it is stale, it's very hard to chew* (but still tastes good). When it is fresh, it is absolutely awesome. Stonewall's is my favorite brand of vegetarian jerkey. I like mild best, and teriyaki is my second favorite. Both of these flavors are safe if you avoid spicy stuff like I do. If you like things hot, try some of the other flavors!<br /><br />*Edit: Someone suggested heating in microwave for about 10 seconds to soften it, and that works beautifully!

review/summary: Great Choice on Popcorn
review/text: This powder is unlike anything I've had with its unique flavors.  It's a mildly sweet, tangy flavor which goes fantastic on popcorn.  While I think most of us love hot, buttered popcorn with an ample amount of salt the simple fact is it's not very healthy.  So, I was on a search to find something which was flavorful on air-popped popcorn, but not too bad nutritionally.  This fits the bill.

review/text: The ad for this product is unclear. The picture shows COARSE sugar, not sanding sugar. This is noted a couple of times in the description, but unless you read the whole thing it is not clear what they are sending. It's also unclear what quantity they are shipping. What you get for $8 plus shipping is basically one pound of sugar...about two cups worth. I suspect there is some place where one could get a better deal.

review/summary: 65% less than my vet charges!
review/text: This product is simple to review.  It's a liver vitamin supplement for dogs.  You'll know if you need, because a vet will likely prescribe it.  We paid $40 for 30 pills at the vet.  After about three weeks the new blood test showed that this product did the trick.  So, after digging around on Amazon for some liver supplement products, I grilled my vet, and eventually dragged the actual name of the product out of them (thumb screws are a great invention, btw!).  I found it here and paid about one-third of what my vet charged--same brand, dosage--EVERYTHING.  So, if your vet prescribes it, this is the place to get it.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: This coffee is okay, not great, but not bad either.  It's smooth, not bitter, but doesn't really have any Kona flavor.  To me it just tastes like a good quality generic coffee, which for the price is okay by me.<br /><br />I have since moved on to 100% Kona that I buy direct from a farmer in Hawaii.  Smith Farms has some of the most affordable 100% Kona, and it's very tasty!  I suggest giving them a try.  You can't buy it on Amazon, but it's worth doing a little Googling to find them.  Shipping is cheap when you buy 2 pounds.<br /><br />So if you just want some decent coffee for not a lot of money, this coffee will do.  If you want to try some 100% Kona, give Smith Farms a try.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: Excellent, mild flavor, smooth tasting coffee
review/text: I used to purchase this coffee blend at BJ's Wholesale when I lived outside of Boston. Hadn't found it locally when I moved away, then discovered I could get it through Amazon. Hurray! So mild & mellow, just enough hint of Kona to make it worthwhile. Compared to supermarket coffee this is miles ahead in smoothness. Caveat: I spent a year in Hawai'i & had real, 100% Kona coffee, which this product makes no pretensions at being. But for the price, you wouldn't have expected 100% Kona, would you? I'm just pleased as punch that I can keep my coffee jar stocked without breaking the bank or resorting to bitter-tasting supermarket coffee.

review/text: After falling in love with Kona coffee while in Hawaii we tried finding some back on the East Coast that wouldn't break our wallets like the 100% Kona would.  This is a great blend at a much more reasonable price.  We taste tested it against our traditional brews at home like Dunkin & Folgers and this blend won by a mile. Full bodied, not bitter.  A good deal.

review/text: This coffee is barely palatable especially if you like 100% Hawaiian coffee.  It does not give the percentage of Kona it has in it, but to be a blend it only has to be 10% (I'm not positive though), this coffee in my opinion is not any better than a low end supermarket coffee.

review/summary: Pore dog food
review/text: I got a 8 month old weimaraner puppy who was getting puppy chow when I got him. He was a little underweight but I got him puppy chow because that is all he had since he started eating hard foods. I bought a big bag and then found out how bad it was. I was giving him what the bag recommended for his size and breed and he acted like he was starving all the time. Then I took him to the vet and found out he was losing weight. I ended up having to give him extra food. Now I am mixing in soft food so he gets extra stuff missing from Puppy chow. Once this bag is gone I am going to be switching his food. After getting soft food for two weeks he looks so much better. His coat is beautiful and he has more energy.

review/summary: McDonald's for Dogs-- Worst Dog Food Ever
review/text: When I read that this was the fast food McDonald's of dog food, I brushed it off as an over exaggeration. I even saw a whole page, maybe a yahoo answers where a woman said she was giving puppy chow to her dog, and EVERYONE like 12 people WENT IN, and told her it was the worst food any dog could have and to change as soon as possible.... long story short, they were 100% right.<br /><br />I got a new toy poodle puppy and started him off on this b/c I thought it was what he had been getting before. I promise you within 24-48 hours of him eating this stuff his coat quickly started deteriorating and dulling out, it looked sparser thinner and he looked kinda crazy actually, lol, and his eliminations/poo was dark black and hard as a rock. I could literally see a change in the health look of my dog. After a few days, I ended up buying some Pedigree for puppies (which most closely looked like the sample food he was sent with) and within 24-36 hours he started looking healthier, his coat was whiter, his eliminations/poo looked a lot healthier-- a brownish color and softer.<br /><br />Puppy Chow is GARBAGE (especially for breed that have long coats of hair). Pedigree is in the exact same price point, but SO much better for your puppy. Until I find my little boy the perfect higher end food to eat he'll get Pedigree Puppy Complete.<br /><br />Do not ever buy your puppy Purina Puppy Chow. It's the food for puppy millers and strays... just really really really really bad stuff.

review/summary: Not enough sustenance for my puppy
review/text: We brought home an 7.5 week old lab puppy and bought purina puppy chow since that is what the breeder was feeding him. He got a total of 2 cups a day split between 3 different feeding times. We didn't have any issues the first couple of days, but then we started noticing that our lab would dry heave in the middle of the night. It progressively got worse and worse to where it was happening every night or multiple times at night. When we took him to the vet she said that he was a little chunky for his age of 9 weeks old. We ended up switching him to a "holistic" brand of puppy chow and haven't had any dry heaving at night since even though he is fed the exact same amount, at the same time of day as when we had him on purina. Of course I am not an expert, but I think that purina puppy chow did not have the right nutrients for our puppy. It did bulk him up, a little too much according to the vet, but didn't have enough calories to really sustain him, especially at night. I am giving this two stars because I could tell our puppy LOVED the taste of the food and it didn't give him gas like his current food does.

review/summary: Awful food
review/text: I have never tried this product nor will i ever but for those who are looking to purchase or who do, this dog food (i call it food loosely) is a crime to your dogs. its gross. filled with corn fillers and by-products and a whole lot of other nasty things.Do research on your dog food dont go by what comercials tell you, no one said they told the true.in fact most dog foods you see on television are awful.If you love your dog feed as it should be fed. educate yourself. would you feed your children a life diet of junk food full of atificial flavor,colors, and fullers? I'd hope not but thats what this food is. remember you get what you pay for, and paying so little for that amount doesn't make you wonder? Would you buy a $2 stake? no, you'd wonder why it was so cheap... because it crap! Good food requires dogs to eat less because their getting more nutrients from a smaller amount, so their eat less,poop less, and shed less. their skin and coat recieve more nutrients,they have firmer stool, and their overall body is being takin care of. Some better dog foods off of hand:Blue Buffalo,Orijen,Wellness,Nutro,Natural balance,Castor and pollux. these are just a couple of foods of the top of my head that are holistic and natural, but its important to research and shop around and find whats good for your dog. Hope it helps.

review/summary: Kikkoman Plum Sauce
review/text: We bought this Kikkoman Plum Sauce from our Grocery Store.  It was for a hung roasted whole duck from the local Asian Market.  This duck was as good as Duck I've had in Hong Kong. We made our own pancakes/crepes Hong Kong style.  We cut Fresh green spring onions.<br /><br />We tasted this sauce before ruining our duck. The sauce was absolutely the worst.  Bad flavor, bad smell.  Not real Plum Sauce, it's mostly bad Soy Sauce.  We returned it.  Bad stuff.

review/summary: rotten, smelly, expired walnut
review/text: None of three bags of walnut is fresh.  When I opened the bag, unpleasant odor came out.  I opened three all, none of them was edible. It contains strong, out-of-dated smell.  I could not find the expiration date on the bag. This produce totally wastes of money.  Keep away from this product. I would choose 0 star if I could. This is the worst experience I ever have in Amazon.  I got to throw all of them away!

review/summary: Coffee Treat
review/text: I'm a long time coffee junkie.  I think I had my first cup when I was five or six years old.  One of my most potent memories as a child growing up in New York was going to Schraffts or Chock Full 'O Nuts to enjoy a cup of coffee, New York style.  I've gone from stove top percolated pots to electric pots to camp-fire brewed to drip machines. And I must include several years of "chow hall" coffee while in the military.  I've been using whole beans for many years and even spent a few years roasting my own beans.  In all, some sixty years of varied levels of products & as varied means of delivery.  Then a friend recommended Yirgacheffe.  Now I cannot compare Coffee Bean Direct's Yirgacheffe product to other roasters but I can say, without exception, this is one fine tasting coffee.  Two cups, prepared with a French press, and my day begins in a most positive way.  The price is right, the quality is outstanding and the taste - well you have to try it for yourself.  Do yourself a favor, you'll enjoy the flavor.  Coffee Bean Direct has a winner with this coffee.

review/summary: Some of the best coffee I've ever had
review/text: This is a medium roast coffee with a rich, smooth mouthfeel.  Brewed in our Viking drip coffee maker.  I'm not real good at coffee tasting notes but it had a sweetness to it that allowed me to use less creamer (typically use the Coffeemate flavored liquid creamers).  Wifey likes it too - she doesn't like dark roasted coffee (ie Charbucks) very much, prefers a medium-light to medium roast.  This one fits the bill.  I will be ordering this again in the 5lb bag size.

review/summary: Quite possibly the worst coffee I have ever had.
review/text: As the title says: This is quite possibly the worst coffee I have ever had. The coffee is not of good quality (or roasting) and is probably many months old. This coffee is stale, expired, with no expiration date on the package. That is the one reason I will not be buying anything else from "Coffee Bean Direct", (even though they have some decent products). I'm sure it sat in Amazon's warehouse for months after they received it as well. I made some of this coffee, and it is the most bitter swill that I've ever tasted. It caused my stomach to produce excess acid and gas,and the flavor is awful. It tastes like some old 100% robusta. I will be throwing it out. I can't imagine how other people who reviewed this coffee could give it five stars, even if they received a fresh batch. With coffee, freshness is of paramount importance. Amazon customer service however is superb as always, and I will continue to do business with Amazon, but do not buy this coffee. Trust me, you will regret it.

review/text: Appropriate for dressy nights out. Interesting and complex mix of sweet, herbaceous, spicy. Scent on skin varies widely by user. This one is for when you're feeling modern, arty, cool. Seems to work better for modern dressy than black tie or corporate dressy. The old-world charm angle on this is an interesting counterpoint to its overall contemporary feel. To my knowledge, it's pretty obscure in the U.S., making it a good selection for fragrance fans who want a unique fragrance image. On some, this one's dynamite. Your mileage may vary.

However, only one store in my area (I live in a fairly decent sized city) carries it.  Even the baby stores don't.  Even on here, it's a hit or miss thing as to whether or not it will be in stock.

So even without detailed pictures of BOTH the front and back labels OR the having ingredients listed on this product's description, I purchased this item. When it arrived I was very disappointed because this product contains only 10% juice!<br /><br />This "flavored beverage" is a juice drink in my estimation and an expensive one at that. The first two ingredients are: Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup...I'm so confused about what actually is considered: Juice, Juice Cocktail, Juice Drink, Flavored Water and/or how much juice is really in each of them. The consumer is at the short end of this confusion and this deal in particular.

review/summary: Far superior to the 'non Greenies' pill pockets.
review/text: Like the other reviewer, I have also ordered Pill Pockets multiple times from multiple vendors over the last few years. I'm not sure about him, but I was always ordering the Pill Pockets that weren't from Greenies and they were almost always smashed and torn up. Occasionally I would get a good shipment, but it didn't seem consistent for any given vendor.<br />Finally, I tried the Greenies brand and these all arrived in excellent shape. It could just be the vendor, but these Pill Pockets seem to be of much higher quality than the others. They seem firmer and much less oily. My dogs love them just as much, so I'll be sticking with Greenies in the future.

review/summary: How we keep the cost down on this great product
review/text: I would echo what many others have said about the Greenies being heaven-sent. Our two chihuahuas get a mix of bitter-tasting herbs/supplements, and the Pill Pockets have proven to be the easist, most effective (and most fun!) way to get them to take their daily dose (powders/tinctures which I mix up with a little coconut oil, divide into pea-sized "pills" and freeze). Our dogs like the Pill Pockets so much we use them as training treats! They're kind of pricey, but I use them in a way that not only works better for our small dogs, it's much less expensive! :o)<br /><br />When I first tried to give the pills in whole Pill Pockets, they were just too big for our 11-14 pound dogs to swallow without chewing (and discovering that there was yucky-tasting stuff inside, and spitting them out), so I needed to make them smaller and more "trustworthy". So in addition to reducing the size (and cost!) as I'll describe next, I also got them hooked on the treats by only giving small pieces of empty Pill Pocket a few times, until their suspicion abated.<br /><br />Now what I do is divide each (large) Pill Pocket into 4 quarters, and flatten a piece out into a concave oval on my palm with my thumb (they're about the consistency of play-doh or clay, and very maleable). Then I fold/smoosh/seal it around the pill, being careful not to get the scent/taste of the pill onto the outside of the Greenie. Before offering the Pill Pocket, I divide one of the other quarters into pea-sized treats. After a big build-up ("Who... would like... a... SPECIAL TREAT!!"),I give them each one of the little pill-less treats (after a simple command like "sit" or "stay"--giving it as part of a training situation, followed by lots of praise, seems to get them even more enthusiastic about getting the treat)that they won't stop to inspect or even chew it). Then I give them the treat with the pill inside, and they're so excited, they don't stop to inspect or even chew it. They wolf it down so fast they obviously have no idea it has their nasty-tasting supplements in it (MSM, Dogzymes Ultimate and Verm-X for immune system enhancement and parasite prevention). I follow up with some other less expensive, but well-liked treats. If you have larger pills, or larger dogs, you might only be able to cut the PillPocket into 2-3 pieces, but then you're still cutting the cost by 2-3 times as well (and possibly making it easier for your dog to swallow without finding the pill).<br /><br />One note that may or may not be relevent to your situation--I wanted to save time, so made up a batch of the Greenie-wrapped pills to keep in the frige. Unfortunately, the flavor/scent of the herbs/supplements apparently leeched into the Greenie layer, and the dogs didn't want anything to do with them. So now I just make them on the spot--it only takes a few moments, and I use the time to call the dogs and tell them about how tasty it's going to be, etc., and it's just become part of the treat ritual. :o)<br /><br />Additional FYI use for anxious dogs/cats: I also use pill pockets with L-Theanine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017KHVM2">L-Theanine 180C</a> as a substitute for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WOOC9S">Composure for Medium and Large Dogs, 60 Soft Chews</a> as a natural calming aid for the dogs when they will be alone all day, having company, going to the vet, etc. L-Theanine is only one of the 3 active ingredients in Composure, but it seems to do the trick and "take the edge off" for our excitable chihuahuas. I just squish the contents of the capsule into a flattened pill pocket, work it with my fingers until it's completely blended, then divide it into individual doses, which I store in the frige. I strongly recommend that you do your own research about dosage--Composure's manufacturer, Vetri-Science, has detailed weight/dosage instructions on their website, from which I derived the dosage that I use. L-theanine is almost tasteless, it just needs a "dosing vehicle" because it's a powder, and the capsules for humans have way too much in them for my dogs (and I don't want to put it in their food because one might eat it all, or the cats might get it, etc.)<br /><br />I've only used the chicken flavor (our dogs loved it so why mess with success?), and this is my first time ordering directly from Amazon. I've bought them at the pet store (much more expensive) and an Amazon marketplace vendor (much, MUCH more expensive, as it turned out--I thought I was getting six 9.6 oz packages for 26.59 including shipping, but received six 1.6 oz packages, totaling 9.6 oz, instead--I'm awaiting a refund, and ordering these directly from Amazon at a great price instead!).

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: I have to give my yorkie a pill twice a day. I can't give the pills without these since my dog spits the pills out. I like these because I can smash a piece of it and roll that around the pill for her to eat. I use one pill pocket for at least 4 times of administering pills. But since these are so delicious, my cat and my other dog knows when I am opening up the bag by the sound. So, when I am finished rolling the pill pocket around the pill, I turn around and see 3 pets staring at me. So, I've decided that now I'd better have an ample supply for the three pets that want some twice a day. I have to hide this in my drawer becasuse they will find it and break it open. I'm saving a few bucks by ordering it online. Which is great since I have to supply these as treats as well as adminstering pills.

review/text: My dog has Addison's Disease and has to take two pills daily.  These things are great for giving medicine.  I use to wrestle with her to get her to take them and then I'd have to watch her to make sure she wouldn't spit them out.  I don't worry about that anymore!  The only bad thing is, the dogs love them so much, you have to keep them out of sight!  After giving my one dog her medicine, I get, "the look" from the other one and I have to give him one as a "treat"!!!  Funny story that proves how much they like them....I stopped by the house to get my package from the porch and put it inside.  I figured it would be okay because it was a sealed USPS package.  Well...My dogs got onto my desk, pulled the package down, ripped the box apart and started digging in!  I was taking the trash to the curb and 10 minutes later, they ate 4 of the 6 bags!

review/text: These came very quicky. I have no complaints on the delivery. Most of the pockets were in pieces, so I would just build a pocket around the pill with the pieces. It still tasted good, as my dog didn't notice the difference.Still takes her pills with no problem.

review/text: My dog is smart.  You can bury a pill in a steak and she'll spit the pill out.  Tried cheese, meat, hotdogs - all of which are only modestly healthy for the dog - then we found these.  Instant success.  There are 2 sizes, the smaller ones are small. Aspirin sized.  We needed the bigger ones for most of the dog pills.

review/summary: pill pockets!  the inventor of these is just brilliant!!!
review/text: I want to personally thank the one who invented the Pill Pockets.  As my dog got older, I was given the position of giving her pills for different ailments so that she may have a good quality of life...I have wrapped them in cheese, bologna, shaved turkey...but when I found these pill pockets and in flavors, well!...  She takes them as treats.  Her favorite is the chicken flavor.  If I take too long getting her pills in them, she paws at the bag, or even once grabbed the bag with her teeth!...and delivered right to the home!

review/summary: Lifesaver...literally
review/text: I have 2 dogs that take meds.  One takes 3'pills twice daily, the other 1 capusule every other day.  I used to get away with hiding the meds in peanut butter, but my fox terrier became wise to it.  He wouldn't take the peanut butter anymore. It seems his med, cyclosprorine, for allergies, developed this strong odor that the peanut butter didn't cover.  The greenies pill pockets do a spectacular job of camoflaging all aspects of meds.  I buy the bigger size for capsules, and my dogs absolutely LOVE their greenies.  It is now their favorite treat.

review/text: My geriatric, food-hating dog requires at least 5 pills a day. Greenies pill pockets are so disgusting that no dog, not even my picky eater, can resist them. I no longer have to battle and torture him into taking his meds; instead, it's like the best part of his day. These pill pockets were a great invention. I wish they were less expensive, but hey, you get what you pay for, so....

review/text: These pill pockets were recommended at our veterinary clinic.  We have an older Yellow lab, who is on regular medications.  These pill pockets are so easy and convenient to use.  It's a relief to know your "critter" is getting the required medication.  With pill pockets you can monitor medications more easily, and be  positive that meds aren't left in the food bowl, or stuck on your pets lip.  So thank you to the vet tech for recommending.  Thank you to Amazon for supplying such a GREAT product!!

review/text: These pill pockets are well worth the money. My dogs love them. The pockets are also substantial, so you only need to use half a pocket for one large capsule. I keep them in the refrigerator and they don't get hard and dry like those of other brands. I definitely recommend the Greenies brand. It's the best quality for the price combo I have found so far.

review/summary: If you have to give Pills, Pill Pockets is THE BOMB
review/text: If you own a dog or cat( yes, they make them for felines too)........this is the greatest stuff. My doggies (5 German Shorthaired Pointers)  used to line up each morning for their pill "treats". They liked both chicken and beef flavors.  Chicken seems to be more elastic and wraps around the pills better. Beef, unless sealed tightly, tend to dry out more.  This has been a staple in our house for many years, until our last pooch crossed the rainbow bridge last Christmas.  But when we adopt our next pooch, and if he/she needs medications,....... Pill Pockets will again find a home with us.

review/summary: Pill Pockets are great!
review/text: We have seven very picky dogs, all of whom are rescues and most of whom are on permanent medications.  Before Pill Pockets, we tried everything from simply pushing it down their throat Veterinarian style to wrapping it in peanut butter (what a mess).  With Pill Pockets, however, we just put the capsule or tablet inside and the dogs love them; so much so that when anyone gets a pill, everyone else crowds around trying to get one too.  If you have dogs or cats that need to take oral medications, you can't do better than Pill Pockets.

review/text: My dog is 9 years old, has many health problems, i.e. arthritis, hip dysplsia, etc.  I discovered pill pockets several months ago and fell in love.  Put the medication in, close it up and watch your fingers, cause the dog loves them.  I have to give him pills several times a day and since he is prone to overweight, and the pill pockets are low calorie it is a perfect solution.  Much better than peanut butter for him and no mess for me.

review/text: This was my first order of pill pockets and I seem to have lucked out.  They arrived quickly and were in very good shape, not broken or smashed.  The best thing?  My dog LOVES these, and I can literally hide anything.  Previously it was a struggle to give him his medication (he needs 8 different pills a day!) but now he thinks he's getting a treat.  I just wish they were cheaper - even combining some of the pills I go through 5 or 6 pill pockets a day.  Oh well, its worth it for the convenience and this is certainly a much better price than, say, Petsmart.

It is sugar-free and contains primarily soybean oil, vinegar and pasteurized whole eggs along with garlic, pepper and special seasoning - all natural ingredients and no preservatives.  This has a great aroma and it is an easy way to prepare well-seasoned chicken without resorting to sweet barbecue sauce.  I have used it for baking chicken that I have marinated in the sauce so far.

review/summary: ATTN:  This is NOT CHOCOLATE-FLAVORED COFFEE!
review/text: The marketing and description for this coffee is misleading, and it will no doubt unnecessarily contribute to more and more unhappy customers who mistakenly think "mocha" means "chocolate." Here is the definition of "mocha" in two different dictionaries:<br /><br />  1.)  From thefreedictionary dot com/mocha<br />  mocha -<br />  1. A rich pungent Arabian coffee.  [NoCouth's note:  This is not the first definition people think of, however.]<br />  2. Coffee of high quality.<br />  3. A coffee beverage flavored with milk, sugar, and cocoa.<br />  4. A flavoring made of coffee mixed with chocolate.<br /><br />  2.)  From the food dictionary available at epicurious dot com:  [...]<br />  1. Originally the word "mocha" referred only to a very fine coffee grown in Arabia and shipped from Yemen's port of Mocha. Today, this strong, slightly bitter coffee is still available but not as popular as it was in the 16th and 17th centuries. 2. A hot coffee-and-chocolate beverage.<br /><br />So it is no wonder people will get confused -- and that's simply not good marketing.  Although Amazon's description of this coffee now has "This is not a flavored coffee," I feel that is not specific enough--I would suggest adding the word "chocolate" before "flavored."  Although on the GMCR dot com website the product is categorized as a "regular coffee" and not a "flavored coffee," my modest UCLA Anderson MBA marketing background suggests that Timothy's Coffee company include in its description of this product words to the effect that:<br /><br />  "Mocha Java got its name because long ago in Al-Makha, a historic Yemeni seaport, Javanese coffee was combined, by mistake, with coffee from a more local, Northeast African origin, producing a unique blend which quickly became very popular in the 16th & 17th centuries.  Hence, the "mocha" derived from "Al-Makha" and the "java" derived from "Javanese."  While Timothy's Mocha Java is not a chocolate-flavored coffee as the modern name "mocha" may imply, it is a richly blended regular coffee steeped in Old World tradition, with the bright sweetness of Ethiopian beans and the hearty body of Indonesian beans."<br /><br />Just my two cents.  As a "regular coffee," it's slightly bitter and would be difficult to drink "black" in my opinion, but with some non-dairy creamer added (along with the requisite included corn syrup sweetener additive), it's fine.

review/summary: Gold standard...Years of research on my part...
review/text: When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my "baby" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE "health" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept "treating" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and "cured" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.

review/summary: No meat by-products, good and safe, Turkey & Chicken Dog Food
review/text: Everyone knows about tainted pet food from China.<br /><br />Newman's Own is a branding that I can trust, and this one is a real winner.  Newman's is what I would make if I were making it for my own family, as in you can trust that it is great tasting, good for you and safe to eat.  I'm very pleased that the Newman's line was extended from people food to pet food.<br /><br />When it comes to moist dog food every single choice on the market has meat by-products except Newman's Own.  My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety.  In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too.  While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog.<br /><br />One other finding:  When you open almost any moist dog food you smell "dog food".  When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat.  It actually smells good.  Imagine that.

review/summary: My little yorkie is 14 years old and developed digestive problems a couple of years ago
review/text: My vet gave him a prescription diet which helped him tremendously but he HATED it and wouldn't eat it until he just couldn't stand being hungry any more.  With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return.  Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription.  Not only did he like it, he was fine!  I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine!  I was so happy!  And so was my little dog!

review/summary: Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.
review/text: UPDATE:<br />The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great.<br /><br />Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution:<br /><br />I have been buying the "Organic Liver for Dogs" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Amazon. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product.<br /><br />I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Amazon are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets.<br /><br />As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally).<br /><br />UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me.<br /><br />I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars.<br />I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well.<br />I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars.<br />Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars.

review/summary: Must have been a contaminated batch
review/text: We bought a case of 12 12 oz cans back in April. Just now opened the first can. Wow. Consistency of vomit, grayish tinge, and a vile odor. Opened a second can -- exactly the same. No way were we going to feed it to our dog. Something was clearly wrong.<br /><br />We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase.  Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA.

review/summary: Perfect Dog Food
review/text: My Pomeranian has a very sensitive digestive system and I could never find a food that I knew would provide him both great nutrition, taste and no allergic reaction.  Until this canned food ----- that is.  He loves it and it is made so well.  You can tell there are no fillers in it by the appearance and texture.  In fact, when you read the ingredients there is only Turkey Brown Rice and Vitamins.  I encourage anyone who is thinking about ordering this food to give it a try.  Your pooch will be glad you did.

review/summary: The Organic Beef Canned is Inconsistent....
review/text: I've been buying the Newman's Own Canned Organic BEEF for my 9 year old Diabetic Rottweiler to add more protein to her diet since she has been losing weight since her diagnosis 3 years ago.  During the last 6 months that I've been buying it, the consistency of the canned food has been all over the place.  Sometimes it's quite firm and I really have to dig in with the spoon to remove it, sometimes it's a good average firmness, and other times it's extremely mushy.<br /><br />Most recently, the last 2-3 12-packs I've purchased from Amazon or Whole Foods (at different times, not from same lot) have been so soupy that I could pour it out of the can and onto her special diet which is Honest Kitchen Embark.  In the bottom of the can, half the time there has been a thick gelatinous layer and the rest of the time, it is a yellow liquid layer instead so it's pretty gross.  I've been shaking the cans before I open them to mix it up before I pour it out.<br /><br />I've decided not to purchase the Canned Organic Beef any longer.  My dog has been having loose stools lately and I think it's from the soupy canned food.<br /><br />I did buy some of the Newman's Own 100% Liver Canned at Whole Foods and the consistency was very good so I'm going to try ordering this one from Amazon next time instead.  I hope the Liver Canned will remain the right firmness and consistency because I'd rather give my dog all meat without veggies or grain carbs that will affect her sugar levels.  She gets some of those things in the Embark already.<br /><br />Not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the Beef Canned but based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this particular type of Newman's Own canned.  I can't speak for their other canned food items.

review/summary: Newman's Own pet food
review/text: I have an extremely fussy little Shih Tzu who won't eat dog food.  I discovered she will eat Newman's Own Turkey and Chicken formula of which I found 2 cans at a pet store.  After searching on line for a better supplier I discovered Amazon not only carries the food but would send me a case a month on an on-going basis.  The price is the best I found and I even get free shipping.  Every month I get an email allowng me to opt out of that month's supply if I wish.  I am happy and my dog is very happy.  I strongly recommend checking out Amazon's pet food.
