review/summary: Purchased a bag with way too much salt - Company provided a replacement: almonds were perfect
review/text: Original review -- I thought I had purchased salt with almonds in it. The amount of salt is RIDICULOUS and very unhealthy. Almonds are a healthy snack but not if they are this salty.<br /><br />UPDATE -- I contacted the company and they provided a replacement. The new bag was perfect, the almonds were tasty and not too salty. It seems that I purchased a bag from a bad batch. The company was prompt at correcting the problem. I originally gave the product a 1 star rating, I'm updating the review and giving the product 4 stars.

review/summary: The best tasting almonds; lower sodium is just a bonus
review/text: I love nuts of all kinds, and eat some almonds and walnuts every day. I've tried all the brands of almonds--salted, unsalted, raw, dry-roasted, spiced, cocoa covered, you name it. These are by far the tastiest of all brands and types I've tried. Great texture, a hint of salt...just right. The only problem with these is that they're so delicious its hard to stop eating them. Plus, Amazon beats the store price. Love them...

review/summary: Delicous salty snack
review/text: Its hard to stick to the rule of doing everything "in moderation" with these tasty snacks around. Salty, smokey, a wonderful and more nutritious alternative to potato chips. Good with cocktails, good by the handful. I've snacked on them before dinner, watching tv, having a drink, or at bedtime. And did I mention the price? The 3 pack is so much cheaper than buying singles at the grocerystore. All round great snack!

review/summary: Delicious Blue-Diamond quality, half the sodium
review/text: I need to watch my sodium - but I'm not really a fan of salty foods in the first place.<br /><br />These almonds are perfect, at half the salt.  I would prefer them over the regular salted almonds any day!  I have no idea why anyone would want to put MORE salt on these delicious nuts.<br /><br />The three-count 16-ounce bags (with Prime shipping) pop on and off of Amazon - buy them when they are available.  Otherwise you must buy the six-pack of small cans, at a higher price per ounce.

review/text: What's not to like?  Delicious smokehouse almonds in the perfect size package.  I keep them in my locker at the gym for a post workout snack.  They are very smokey-don't leave an open package in your car, like I did...It made my car smell like cigarettes.  However, this is unlikely to happen as it is hard to only eat part of the package as they are so good.

review/summary: I love these almonds and all...
review/text: ...but the cans were smaller than I expected for the price I paid.  I dunno, I just expected to be saving a lot more than that when buying in bulk.  It's the same price (about $3 a can) at the local Target.  Plus, and this is a personal problem, I had a hard time being conservative with em.  They are delicious (not as good as the smoked ones though which Amazon doesn't sell for some reason) and I couldn't stop eating them!  I went through two cans in the first night!  I love to snack, but almonds aren't the best for snacking in large quantities, and I won't explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.  Anyways, the nuts are perfectly fine and it's a decent price (considering you're not paying sales tax outside of NY and that there's free shipping if you're patient) so I can't not recommend them, although I will never buy em again in this quantity.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: DESCRIPTION:<br />> Blue Diamond Roasted-Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are "heart healthy" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself.  Roasted Salted Almonds are available in bags or small cans small.<br />> Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are similar with wonderful smokey flavor.  At this time Smokehouse Almonds are available from Amazon only in 16 oz (and smaller) bags.<br />> I have not tried the "lightly salted" variety but I presume that they have almost no salt.<br /><br />CANS vs BAGS<br />Various types of Blue Diamond Almonds are available in bags or small cans.  The small cans (3 1/4" in diameter by 2 3/8" high) are very convenient and assure that the almonds stay fresh until openned, and afterward, because they don't stay "openned" long (it is easy to eat a whole can at one setting).  Arguably the bags more environmentally friendly, but you don't get much of a price break for the much cheaper packaging.  I prefer the convenience and freshness of the cans.<br /><br />EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful.  Well roasted and crunchy.  I cannot decide which I like best: the Roasted Salted or the Smokehouse.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  I happen to like the roasted-in-oil flavor.<br /><br />LESS ROASTED ALMONDS<br />If you prefer less-roasted almonds, roasted without added oil, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COJ85G">Back To Nature California Almonds, Sea Salt Roasted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />UNROASTED ALMONDS<br />Unroasted almonds are available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COE1AI">Back To Nature California Almonds, Unroasted & Unsalted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> but beware that thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.  Unroasted almonds are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.  While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds, (which have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods).  Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer.  Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw.  7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child.  Moreover, a child raised on raw almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) are safe to eat---they are NOT.  The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds.

review/summary: Taste good but do not comply with my diet
review/text: I'm counting carbs, and I ordered these hoping they would provide an alternative for me to high-carbohydrate snacks. The similar veggie chips I have bought in the grocery store list 2 grams of carbs; this product lists 18g; fiber - only 2g -- that's 16 net carbs, way too many allowed on my diet. It would be helpful to have the nutrition facts presented on the product page before purchase (or if it is there - I missed it). Sugar is not listed as an ingredient so I am not sure why these are so high in carbs as the similar product with 2grams lists the same ingredients: sweet potato, squash, carrot, green bean, and taro. The other figures are not bad: calories: 130, fat calories, 50, total fat: 6g; saturated fat: 0g; trans fat: 0g. Although on my low carb diet, I don't have to worry so much about calories and fat. Hope this review is helpful to you.

review/summary: Great Snack For On The Road
review/text: These chips have no hydrogenated oils (no trans fats) and they contain taro, not taro oil (typo in description). I chose these as most chip snacks contain the usual potatoe/potatoe starch which are in the nightshade family (sweet potatoe is from a different family of plants) along with some 'nightshade' seasonings like red & bell peppers, paprika, pimento (salt & regular pepper are ok), tomatoe, etc - all of which I try to avoid due to allergies. These have a slight sweetness which seems to be added possibly from the dextrin, & lots of crispy crunch. Usually I'm not super crazy about sweet potatoe chips, but they go well with all the other veges in this mix. My husband took these individual containers on the road with him in his semi. He really liked these. And surprisingly, there are quite a few chips in each container.

review/text: We cannot believe how flavorful this Kraft Thick and Spicy Brown Sugar Barbecue Sauce tastes.  I used this to cook some very meaty chicken breast and the flavors popped!  It's not too spicy for us and I assume it's because of the brown sugar.  You can't go wrong with buying a product from Kraft Foods.

review/summary: Very soothing!
review/text: After staring at these for weeks on my bookstore's shelves, I finally gave in to the temptation & purchased one of the various "Be/Get" teas that touted various different health benefits.<br /><br />I'll be honest & say that while this tea has a lot of great things in it, I wouldn't recommend that you expect miracles. The antioxidants will help but what really made a difference with me was that I'd replaced a few of my other drinks with this tea. (Sodas & other caffeinated beverages do not do good things for your skin.) Plus the drink has plenty of soothing herbs in it (chamomile, my favorite!), which helps lessen stress- something else that will probably help you see improvements. I recommend it just for the stress benefits alone.<br /><br />Taste-wise, this is a strange concoction. Not bad, just different. There's a lot of flavors here to taste but somehow it works out well. What I loved most about this was that you really didn't need sugar in this drink- it tastes just as good without it than it would with it. I also loved that it was good cold, which will come in handy when it gets really warm.<br /><br />So the bottom line? This will absolutely help you out health-wise but don't expect dramatic improvements.

review/summary: Sweet and Soothing
review/text: I purchased a tin of Get Gorgeous tea at a local shop because I'm trying to improve my overall health.  I should note that I'm also taking a multivitamin, a hair/skin/nails vitamin, and flax seed oil capsules (all vegan) once a day, so if I see improvement in the condition and clarity of my skin, it's as likely as not that both resulted from the many changes I'm making to my diet and lifestyle choices as from this tea.<br /><br />However this is still a really delicious, soothing blend of rooibos, chamomile, orange peel, and several other herbal ingredients.  I'm not big on fruity teas, but Get Gorgeous has just enough fruity flavor to keep a drinker from needing to add sugar.  The dominant flavor is definitely a soothing herbal one.<br /><br />Since I live in the South, where sweet tea rules all, I would recommend this to anybody who wants to give up sugar-sweetened tea without sacrificing a familiar flavor.  I've never liked sweet tea, but I have tasted it, and Get Gorgeous has a similar (though not nearly as strong) sweet taste that I think would go over well with health-conscious Southerners.

review/text: My dog loves these bones. He is a 12 pounder and theyre the perfect size for him. In the past, I have bought him larger rawhide dog bones, but they end up being too big; he doesnt even go near them. Im not sure why these say "dental" what ever because its the same product as a regular mini dingo bones in the orginal red bag/packaging. The only thing I wish they had about this product is if they sold it a bigger quantity. My dog goes through these bones like water. But its worth it. It keeps him from getting into other things. He just sits for hours and naws at them.

review/summary: Good for Petite & Small Dogs.
review/text: When I first got it my pup loved it! I thought it was the perfect size for petite and small dogs. My pup is exactly 15 pounds right on the dot. So it's hard to find chews for him to actually enjoy and be able to hold it with his tiny paws. The Dingos are actually priced decently on amazon so I have no complaints about that. It's really hard to find cheap and good chews. It's great that he is able to chew it for about 45 minutes ~ 2 hours on each Dingo, depending if he ends up trying to hide some of them. That can give our family some alone time.<br /><br />The only thing I do not like it's that the chicken is dyed red. I don't think it's necessary to make the dingo stand out as long your pup can smell the chicken. Also the chicken is actually more appealing than the rawhide part. I'd try buying a bag of Pork Chomps Twists(Pork Skin Rawhide, with no chicken meat) and it seemed like he was more interested in the Pork Chomp Twist than the Dingo with the chicken. Makes me wonder?<br /><br />The bag also says that this product was MADE IN CHINA...a bit dangerous?<br /><br />Anyhow I will only buy the Pork Chomp Twists (30 pack) once in a while because it only usually last less than 10 minutes which is a disappointing. They also cost more than Dingos. So I am going to stick to the daily Dingo ritual and give him a Pork Chomps Twist on special occasion like the holidays or his birthdays.<br /><br />Edit: I might switch to a better alternative because I really don't want to continue to feed Stitch rawhide and red dyes. Hopefully I can find something better as our daily ritual than Dingos.

review/summary: Just like being in Venice!
review/text: I was recently in Venice with my husband and friends and we went to Harry's Bar at Saint Mark's Square.  This is the bar where Bellini's were invented so we had to try them. The bellinis on their menu cost around 18 Euro each (roughly 25 U.S. Dollars per drink!) and the 5 of us had 2 rounds (Yikes! That was quite a bill!) But the drinks were wonderful and worth it. I loved the drink so much I wanted to pick up the cans of Bellini mix right then and there, but my husband reminded me of the lack of space in my luggage so I had to leave them behind.  We were in Venice for several days and we stopped at other bars to try their Bellinis.  Whatever we were served was too sweet and didn't taste anything like what we had loved at Harry's Bar. When I got home I went online and immediately ordered this mix.  While I waited for the shipment to arrive (it only took about 4 days - and we live in Germany so that's impressive!) I went to the local Italian Supermarket and bought a pre-made Bellini mix to tide me over.  Again, it was disappointing.  Finally the Cipriani Bellini Mix arrived and my travel companions and I tried the bellini mix with champagne. We all agreed that it was excellent and of all the Bellini's we tried this mix was the closest to what we were served in Venice.  Each can makes 3 drinks and we went through 4 cans that night - only stopping because I ran out.  I'm back on this website today to order another 12 cans and my husband and I agreed that this must be a permanent staple in our bar. The product is excellent, the shipping was fast, and the product arrived in perfect condition.  From now on this is a product that my bar will not be without! Cin cin/Salute/Cheers!

To their credit though, they are going to look for real butter stroopwafeln to stock, and send me some for no charge. I'll let you know how it goes!

I did some research and learned that this product comes from one of the largest roasters in Italy located on the Amalfi Coast.

review/text: I've always loved tic tacs and fruit-flavored candies so when I spotted these "new" fruit adventure flavored tic tacs, I just had to try them.  And they did not disappoint.  The fruit flavors are intense and tangy.  I'm a fan of orange tic tacs, but these are my new favorites.  Now I just have to hide them from the others in my household, who also seem to love them!

review/summary: Black Pudding Review
review/text: Received the black pudding yesterday. The dry ice had long ago evaporated and the pudding was only slightly cool to the touch.<br /><br />Tried it this morning. Similar to Irish version but a bit more bland. Also, it contains substantially less grain filler . Closer to Canadian blood sausage than to Irish Black Pudding. It will do when you can't get the real thing.

review/summary: You get what you pay for?  Or is catnip tantamount to snake oil?
review/text: This is the first catnip I've bought.  It seemed the best bang for the buck at the time of purchase, especially considering the top rated brand was 1/3 the amount for the same price.  I've used it in toys, rubbed it between my fingers as the package directs, etc.; yet our three month old kitten just doesn't seem to care.  She'll "usually" come up and take a whiff when I open the bag or coax her to see what I've got in my hand, but she quickly loses interest.  And it never manages to put her into some euphoric state, much less even settle her down, when she's running around, going crazy, as growing, restless housecats do.<br /><br />The catnip smells mostly like ground tea leaves, to me.  The only praise I can offer regards the volume that comes in the package compared to most other offerings on amazon, and that it comes in a resealable bag - not a "ziplock" bag like another reviewer indicated; it's clearly a professionally packaged product, but one with a ziplock style closure.  And, as others have noted, the bag is 3oz NOT 3.5 as amazon's title erroneously misadvertises.  Even so, it's still the best value on amazon, assuming it works as well as the other, more expensive, brands.  Considering all but maybe the most expensive has received mixed reviews of effectiveness, and that the best rated/most expensive option appears to be charging more for a tin can, I'm reluctant to invest more in a product that may only be effective for certain cats, if indeed it's not another form of snake oil.  Maybe I should have done my usual research beforehand.<br /><br />Update:  Having put this in several toys, a cardboard scratching pad and even sprinkled a little on her food once or twice per week, our kitten not only shows disinterest in this product now, but practically runs away when I open the bag as if the smell actually offends her.  We have three large, cat-eating dogs outside, which we rescued her from right after they got two of her siblings - they had wondered into the dogs radio fence boundaries and got trapped inside a tractor - so she has to stay indoors.  I was really hoping this might settle her down when she gets stir crazy.  But it doesn't, not in the least.

review/text: I have lived in many places around the world and have always managed to find good Basmati rice, but I have never had anything like Tilda. Another reviewer mentioned that the grains are not stuck together. That is very true (low starch) but the best thing is the flavor contained within this rice. Once it is cooked, each grain is delicious and full of flavor. This is the quality where Tilda shines above the rest. The grains are not just long and separate, they are delicious. When I run out and can't find Tilda, I buy something else from Indian stores in Queens. Some are very good, but not as good as Tilda. When you cook it, the aroma builds up - the scent of sacks and far-away places - like nothing else. It goes very nicely with some quality saffron. I find that Tilda is perfect with Turkish or Moroccan food and is great for pilafs (of all sorts, but especially amazing with lamb).

Rinse the rice before boiling, heat up the water to boiling and dump the rice in.  Cook for about 10 minutes and then rinse in a colander with hot water to stop cooking.  Perfect every time!<br /><br />I've also purchased several times from the this vendor and have never had an issue, always prompt shipping and fresh product.

review/text: Basmati rice is a very well kept secret in America. Most Americans seem to think all rice is the same (often boring is mentioned). Basmati rice is an adventure from the moment you read the label on the package. As the rice is cooked, a savory fragrance fills the air not too unlike freshly popped pop corn. Having tried various brands of Basmati rice, none have come close to Tilda. The superior quality of product and packageing has made me a loyal fan.

review/summary: High Quality, Exceptionally Delicious Rice
review/text: I realize I am just adding my voice to the chorus of approval about Tilda Basmati Rice, but I feel strongly enough to write a review anyway!<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL:<br />If you enjoy rice that is drier in texture and has separate grains, Tilda Basmati is GREAT. The flavor of Basmati rice is distinctive, but Tilda Basmati is yummier and nuttier than all the other Indian and Pakistani brands I have tried. I didn't expect that I would be able to taste a difference, but I can.<br /><br />The packaging for this rice is very nice. It's in plastic, rather than a woven bag, and it has a re-closeable zipper, which is useful if you keep your rice in the bag, rather than in a storage container.<br /><br />MORE DETAIL:<br />Basmati is about the longest of the long-grain rices. It has a distinctive, nutty aroma and flavor, and cooks up into fluffier, drier, separated grains, which is at least partially due to the aging process used. In our house, we like this rice texture best for general eating. It is wonderful all by itself, and it goes very nicely with any spicy dish you can imagine. I use it with Indian meals, Thai dishes (except when sticky rice is called for), Chinese food, Mexican, Latin American, and Spanish dishes. I even use it in combination with medium-grain rice to make conjee (jook).<br /><br />This said, some people prefer a shorter-grain rice that sticks together more as their general rice - this rice is not going to work for them.<br /><br />I use short or medium grain rice, such as CalRose, for sushi and other Japanese dishes, and sticky, or "sweet" rice for Thai sticky rice. Sushi rice and sticky rice require specific types of rice to turn out correctly.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />For those who prefer a Basmati rice, Tilda is a high-quality, exceptionally delicious choice.

review/text: For those of you that are not aware,  there has been a huge Basmati Rice fraud going in.  Yes, ...rice that is labeled "Basmati" but isn't actually the real thing.  You can google "Basmati fraud"<br />if you are interested in knowing more.<br /><br />I've been eating Basmati rice for about 20 some years since being introduced by an Indian friend of mine.  I've tried many different kinds,  and gave Tilda a try after Cook's Illustrated rated it the best.  After eating Tilda I began to question whether or not some of the others I have tried were the real thing.  Now I will never go back!<br /><br />Tilda has a very distinct "popcorn" aroma that is out of this world!  Most times  I use the pilaf style of cooking  without rinsing in my rice cooker.  Saute' diced onions in butter first,  then add rice (and some saffron)  and cook for a few minutes,  then liquid on quick cycle.  It turns out perfect every time.  (1-1/2cup  low sodium chicken broth to 1 cup rice).

review/summary: best basmati rice
review/text: we are from rice eating regions of India with a special liking to basmati. We were so excited to find Tilda on Amazon and have been buying the 10 Lb bags every month ( yes thats how much we like it).. It is the finest quality long grain very aromatic and delicious. People from the Indian subcontinent prefer non-sticky long grain rice that comes out as fluffy but single grained in texture once cooked unlike the rest of asia where sticky rice is the norm. The amount of starch is what determines the stickyness. In case of basmati the finest are ones that are very long grained and not at all sticky. Must soak basmati in water for atleast 15 mins before cooking. we use the rice cooker and Tilda comes out perfectly. Biryani , Pilaf and simple plain rice all come out delectably with this. Tilda is definitely considered on of the finest basmati's back home in India and is most often the preferred rice at restaurants and for special occasions at home. At the price Amazon is making this available we have it everyday !

However we judge Royal Basmati Rice to be slightly more flavorful and has a superior texture.

review/summary: recommended as top choice by cook's illustrated.
review/text: I have had very good luck using Cook's Illustrated ratings and suggestions for ingredients and equipment for cooking.  They recommended Tilda Basmati Rice as their top choice. Their second rated was Kohinoor.  They also have suggestions for cooking rice that have are very helpful to make great rice-not mushy, with separated grains.  They suggest rinsing the rice before cooking (to remove starch), using less water than recommended, and after cooking, taking a kitchen towel, and covering the pan for 10 minutes.

review/summary: Delish!
review/text: This is delicious! Better than some rice I've ordered in fine Indian restaurants. The flavor is delightful and I love that my apartment smells like Indian food when I'm cooking it! It cooks pretty quickly, quicker than generic grocery store white or brown rice. I don't know if this means anything about it's quality, but it is nice that it is done so quickly. It cooks up to a soft, medium or long grain and is fluffy. I can't say enough about the taste, texture, smell, etc.<br /><br />Now as for the price and having to buy it in a 10 lb bag... I was a bit concerned about buying the 10 pound bag as I normally buy a 1 lb. bag of rice and I'm only cooking for two adults. This rice was so yummy that we went through a lot at first. Rice is shelf-stable for a long time so with eating rice once a week, I expect this will last 5-6 months. Plus the bag is a very sturdy plastic with a zipper to reclose the bag and keep it fresh. Also has a convenient carrying handle for taking it in and out of the cabinet. Very thoughtful packaging. The price when I bought was $1.86 per lb. for the 10 lb. bag. At my local big chain grocery store, the cheapest basmati rice is $1.97/lb. for a 10 lb. bag. If you buy a smaller bag you'll be paying $3-5 per lb. So this rice is a good deal.<br /><br />Overall, this rice is delicious, convenient and cheap!

review/text: Very tasty and aromatic white rice.  Being an American, I never knew that white rice could be so flavorful.  This was recommended by an Indian friend.  Excellent.  I use my rice cooker to make it.

review/summary: Good rice
review/text: I got a 5 lb bag of the Tilda Basmati rice to try with a Sunbeam rice cooker I got for Christmas. The Tilda rice works very well in this cooker, coming out light and fluffy. I have a Prime membership at Amazon, so shipping cost isn't a consideration. I want to try a wild rice blend for my next bag. The packaging is good quality, heavy duty plastic, and it keeps the rice very well.
