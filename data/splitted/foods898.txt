review/summary: A little torn...
review/text: I'm a little torn on this review.  I think that the key question for any Vine review (which means the product was given free to review) is whether or not the person would buy it (again) with their own money.  In this case, the answer is: I might.<br /><br />I like these crackers/cookies a lot.  They are sweet and crumbly, akin to a Graham cracker.  The "real fruit" may be real, but it is composed of tiny gummy bits o' fig in there, very much like breakfast cereals that boast "real fruit"...<br /><br />I ate a large number of these and craved more.  But at the same time, I felt the same guilty feeling I feel after eating too many Chips Ahoy or Oreos... They are tasty and are pretty elegant looking--they'd be perfect for putting out at a party for a snack.

review/summary: Clear winner
review/text: Generally speaking I find that the changes companies make on classic snacks are really more about grabbing more shelf space for the company than really producing appealing product.  The family of Oreos is a good example, with the originals being the only really tasty family member.  And as a fan of Fig Newtons, I have to say I was skeptical about these new fruit thins, but what the heck, right?<br /><br />Well these things are really good.  Like original Newtons, part of their appeal is that they're not icky sweet.  If anything, these new fruit thins are even less sweet than Newtons, and the sweetener is sugar, not hfcs.  You may or may not care about that.  I think it's important.  What's also important is that a deal of the sweetness, as with Newtons, comes from the fruit.<br /><br />While the cookie itself is made with white flour, it does boast 2g of fiber from the addition of some rolled oats in addition to the dried fruit.  The result is a crisp cookie that has a nice, fruity flavor and no nasty aftertaste.  There are three large cookies to a serving at 140 calories.  That's not a bad snack, really, when you consider how little you get in most of those 100 calorie packs of cookies.<br /><br />This is perhaps not the most wholesome snack you can eat, but you could do far worse, nutritionally, and unless you like the uber sweet, artificial-tasting cookies that flood the supermarket shelves, you'll probably really enjoy the new Newton fruit thins.

review/summary: A British Tea Biscuit? Really?
review/text: These are OK for British Tea Biscuits. The kind your Auntie Maude eats at 4pm with her cup of tea. Not too sweet. Not too much fruit. Not much taste or texture. Nothing to over stimulate or even partially stimulate the senses. Just something to eat mindlessly to curb a small appetite until dinner.<br /><br />I really wouldn't call these cookies, or at least not red-blooded, proud-to-be-an-American cookies. They are certainly not French or Italian or even Greek cookies, either. Newtons Fruit Thins are the wan, oat-y things you get served on a small plate in a London tea room right before the check comes. I have nothing against the UK, but other than Scottish shortbread, I can take or leave their "sweet biscuits".<br /><br />Now, these Newtons Fruit Thins are not particularly bad for you. In fact they have some whole grain flour added to the enriched, unbleached wheat and rice flours. There is soy lecithin for protein. The mild flavoring comes from bits of figs, raisins, honey, sugar and a tiny, tiny bit of cinnamon. Three of them are 130 calories. I got bored at two.<br /><br />In the classic 1963 movie comedy "Come Blow Your Horn", the aging playboy played by Frank Sinatra warns his mooching younger brother to "Stay away from my Fig Newtons!"<br /><br />Fig Newtons! Now that's a cookie I can get excited about!

review/summary: Smelled better than they tasted
review/text: Oh my goodness, these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FELBH8">Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey</a> smelled so good. While the spices are the last item on the list of ingredients ("natural flavor, contains cinnamon"), the scent of homemade oatmeal cookies permeated the room.<br /><br />It's too bad that the cookies were disappointing.  I expected something wonderful from Nabisco's Newton line.  Oh, they weren't bad; they were comparable to generics on the supermarket shelf. They are crispy, not soft like Fig Newtons. However, note that they were dry, and the fruit bits were tough.<br /><br />Scent is supposed to heighten flavor, and that's probably why they tasted as good as they did.  I give them three stars.<br /><br />My Gentleman Caller gave them two stars out of five.<br /><br />I am glad that I was given an opportunity to "try before you buy" because, at their price, I'd rather save my pennies and buy something generic.  If this was my only cookie option, I might skip cookies altogether.

review/summary: Delicious Cookies = Great Snack
review/text: I really wanted to try these cookies because I love Fig Newtons. I got the package and was pleasantly surprised that the bag was resealable. The cookies come in a short tray. My bag had some broken cookies but most of them were whole. I had my husband taste them. He loved them because he could dunk them in coffee and they do not disintegrate. He loved the flavor and texture of the cookie.<br /><br />Since I had some cookie pieces, I decided to see if my dog would like them... he LOVED the cookies. After I gave him the pieces I had to break another 2 coolies because he kept asking for the cookies.<br /><br />Overall, this cookie was a huge success in my household. I will be buying them again.<br /><br />Serving size 3 cookies - 140 calories.

review/summary: a great snack, slightly British, but not "out of this world"
review/text: These "cookies" or "biscuits" remind me of biscuits I eat whenever I'm in Britain.  they're thin, crispy & crumbly.  They're definitely tasty with a strong honey accent.  As for the "fig" taste, there is a mild taste of what you had in the original fig newtons, but it's not so strong that I would definitely pick out the fig.  They remind me of the kind of cookie/biscuit that you would eat with tea.  I liked them.<br />However, my 5 & 3 year olds did not find them as enjoyable.  They found them uninteresting.  That's what I expected since the cookies look like they're intended for a mature audience.<br />What I love about these cookies is that they're a cookie while not being the traditional calorie-loaded cookie we think of.  If I want a tasty, little light snack, I grab one or two of these and I'm good.  Pair it with some grapes and it's a decent snack for a busy mom.  They're delicious and tasty enough for that.<br />why did i give it five stars?  Because I really like them.  Having said that, I won't rush out to buy them, which should make them a four star item.  However, four stars implies there's something wrong with the item, which there isn't.<br />Remember the old commercials for the original fig newtons?  The children sitting with the elder people with British accents having tea?  That's what this product is.  I think they need new product packaging, though.  The box makes them look more fun than they are.  They should be in some organic food-type package that is fashionable because these cookies fit more into that category.  They seem like they would be perfect to flavors like "lavender" and "rose".<br />Overall, give them a try.  The flavor is much lighter than the original fig newtons.  Don't expect your children to love them, though!

review/text: I was looking forward to trying these since I like Fig Newtons and love fig in general. They do have a good taste to them, but I don't like the texture of the fig pieces. They are hard and chewy (like old, stale raisins) and stick in your teeth. I don't find it enjoyable for that reason.

review/summary: I like them, but I'm in the minority
review/text: The main reason the Newton Fruit Thins earned 3/5 instead of 4/5 is because I'm the only one who liked them out of all the people I tested them on.<br /><br />Let me back up. These Fruit Thins are flat, crispy cookies with a touch of fruit flavor (Being from the Fig Newton family, I expected a bit of moisture, but you'll never get confused that you're getting one of your daily fruit servings from these cookies).  Since Amazon sent me an entire package, I shared it with my 8th grade students and some adults. The students across the board tolerated the cookie, but wouldn't select it given a choice. The adults were mixed in their reviews. Some gave it a thumbs down, citing a cardboard bland taste, and others loved it as a low-calorie snack (about 50 calories per cookie.<br /><br />Me, I think they live up to their name--a crispy thin with a hint of fruit. If you like graham crackers, you may like these, although they aren't as flavorful. I certainly don't find the 'luscious flavor of figs, sweet raisins and honey' advertised on the package. A couple of setbacks: The fruit is so sparse--ninth on the ingredient list and behind 'folic acid' and 'palm oil'--I don't know how they can call it 'real fruit'. It is 0 carbohydrates, which is good, but it's also 0% of vitamin C, A and Calcium. You won't eat these for their nutrients.<br /><br />One complaint: the packaging is inferior. When I opened the bag and tried to use the retie at the top, it fell off, so I had to transfer the crisps to a plastic bag.<br /><br />Overall, a good choice for a snack that doesn't overfill you.

review/text: Newtons Fruit Thins are a cross between a cracker and a cookie.  They're rather sweet, but tasty.  Not a bad snack for those counting calories.  The figs are cut up really small, so you don't get the fig flavor like you do with a regular Fig Newton.  They've sat in the pantry for quite awhile, so not a big favorite at our house.

They would be great with a cup of tea for an afternoon snack or a decadent breakfast.  They have some amount of fiber in them. So, you can tell yourself they're nutritious.

review/text: Our household is 66% like, 33% dislike on these "cookies".<br /><br />They have a great crunch and the fig/honey fruit has just the right amount of chewy-ness to it. It is probably 98% crunch and 2% of the fruit chewy-ness.  They also seem to keep well (and maintain the crunch) even after the package was left open overnight.<br /><br />By healthy, well, it is far better than junk food and real chocolate chip cookies - it's a good "healthier" compromise when you really want a quick snack.<br /><br />Our household isn't unanimous on these though - so if your family likes fig newtons, then I'll they will probably like these "cookies" too.<br /><br />I'll be packing the lunch boxes with these...

The cookie had a good taste and crunchy at first, but seemed to have a bitter aftertaste and seemed "waxy".  The aftertaste seemed to be primarily associated with the glazing of the cookie.  Not sure if this was part of the effect of the honey or not.  Anyway, I found it difficult to finish the box and would not buy these from the store.  I tried them a few more times,just to see if anything had changed, but the bad aftertaste was still present.<br /><br />I did not try any of the other flavors and I'm not sure if this one is still offered or not.

review/text: I was a little unsure of how I would like these. I'm a big fan of the texture of Fig Newtons, and since these were thinner, crispier snacks, I didn't know if the familiar flavor would make up for the lack of the usual Newtonish softness. I was pleasantly surprised, however! They're not a replacement for Fig Newtons, but they are an interesting take on figs as overly sugared food-shaped objects. They were softer than expected, but I did like them, and the honey was a nice additional note to the flavor. Good stuff!

review/text: Newtons Fruit Thins are hard to review because my family and I ate them all so quickly! The fruit thin is a cookie with a little bits of fruit (fig) mixed in.  The cookies are crisp, but not overly sweet (they go very well with milk). We enjoyed them more than the classic fig newtons.<br /><br />The hint of honey is subtle and gives the cookie its sweetness.  The fruit bits give a good mix of texture between the crisp cookie and softer fruit.<br /><br />As far as "healthy" goes, Newtons Fruit Thins may be a step up from Chips Ahoy, but ultimately the Fruit Thins are still snack food/junk food.<br /><br />I suggest you buy two of them because everyone in my house enjoyed them quite a bit.  They are a perfect snack and a great choice for something a little different in your cookie treat.

review/text: Before you try the Newtons Fruit Thins, please don't think "cookie" in the traditional way.  At first, I was expecting more of a 100 calorie version of a Fig Newton and I was wrong. This is more of a biscuit wafer (crunchy) with pieces of dried fig in it.  My first bite, I bit into a hard piece of fruit and OUCH. I was not expecting that.  However, the entire package was enjoyed my myself with tea.  The good news? The kids wouldn't go near them!  Ha! Gotta love that!  I am giving the Newton Fruit Thins a 3 due to the hard pieces of fig here and there. I would think that might be an issue for people with dental issues.  As for taste, I would have given them a 5 because I don't like traditional sweet cookies.

review/summary: Kind of dry....
review/text: Don't try these without a big glass of milk! Even the bits of fig are dry and chewy.<br />My husband liked them, so maybe it was me, but it was like a mouthful of dry oatmeal, they have an oatmeal kind of texture/taste.<br />I prefer soft, moist fig newtons to these. They kind of remind me of the tasteless cookies made just for toddlers, but you can't give these to babies, the fig part is too chewy and they contain honey.<br />I never met a cookie I didn't like, until now. I gave it three stars because my husband liked them and my kids didn't spit them out and refuse to eat them, although they weren't wildly enthusiastic about them, but I just didn't like them.

review/summary: Pretty good, not outstanding
review/text: Nabisco's Newtons Fruit Thins are an interesting creation, and they were nice to sample.  I like the flavor-- it's mild, not super-sweet and would actually be a great choice to have with coffee or tea.  The fig pieces are a little hard, but I suppose I'd rather them at that texture than to be super-soft.  The package has lots of servings, so one purchase should last you a while.  Based on my experience with this flavor, I'd like to try the others as well.

review/text: Newton's Fruit Thins Fig and Honey are wonderfully addicting.  This delicious, crispy cookie is filled with little bits of real fruit and made with whole grains who would have known something this healthy would be so yummy. First bite I was not to sure I would like them but quickly realized this unique and lightly sweet flavor combination was filled with delight and surprise and I could not stop eating them.

review/summary: Product Review: Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey Cookies
review/text: As part of the Amazon Vine Review Program, I get to review some pretty interesting items. And I'm always happy when I can snag a food item that we want to try, but not pay money for something we might not like. With food prices the way they are today, you can all understand.<br /><br />So I was thrilled be be able to review the new Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey Cookies!<br /><br />The Newtons Thins line is a new line of delicious, cripsy cookies made with the goodness of real fruit and 8g of whole grains per serving. There are four choices: Fig and Honey, Blueberry and Brown Sugar, Raspberry and CHocolate and Cranberry Citrus and Oats.<br /><br />We all like figs, so i opted to go with the Fig and Honey, as Kiddo REALLY likes fig newtons, and with Summer around the corner, I wanted to see if these would be a good option for a summer snack!<br /><br />First off, I was happy that the package has a resealable (fold-over ties) top- no having to use an extra bag or container to keep the cookies fresh- yeah!<br /><br />Secondly, I was surprised at how large the cookies were each! Healthy cookies usually equate to smaller sizes! The cookies are crisp (as they are thin) and have bits of dried fruit instead of a fruit filling, like tradition Newtons.<br /><br />Even Kiddo was impressed that the cookies tasted good! Now admittedly she said she liked the traditional Newtons better, but then she's four and likes the fruit filling ooiness the best! The adults were split on which they liked better. I think it would depend on what you were in the mood for. We even considered grinding up the cookies for a crust for a cheesecake (but didn't get around to it before too many were gone). I think they would be great as a crust for cookie bars as well! Definitely recommend this for kids and adults!<br /><br />Disclosure / Disclaimer: I received this product for review purposes, free of charge, from the Amazon Vine Program ! No other compensation, monetary or in kind, has been received or implied for this post. Nor was I told how to post about them!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FELBH8">Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey, 10.5-Ounce (Pack of4)</a>

review/summary: flat fig newtons
review/text: If your a fan of dry cookies/crackers, then look no further. Think of these new lil snacks as a flat, dry fig newton. As far as taste is concerned.. In my opinion, not so much. The texture reminds me of a cross between a ginger snap, and a caars cracker, which is not a bad thing in itself. However when i'm eating a cookie, i'm hoping not to have to compare it to somthing else. Try em for yourself. See what u think?

review/summary: Not Stage 3 Quality. Very thin
review/text: I use jar foods when I am on the go or if I did not have time to leave the babysitter food. I made a majority of my twins food from scratch using the baby bullet, a chopper or just by mashing it. Now that my twins are 11months they have been eating table food. I was excited to see that Earth's best made Stage 3 foods.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Particular Stage 3 option (Earth's Best Junior Baby Food Organic Chunky Orchard Fruit, 6-Ounce Jars) is not Stage 3 quality. It is very thin comparable to the Stage 2 food. It does have a few small tiny tiny pieces of fruit in it but nothing compared to the other stage 3 thicknesses. Seeing as my twins are used to have bigger thicker pieces of food they eat the food off the spoon so quickly.<br />As with all Earth's best I love the quality of the food and my twins love the taste. However, I would not have purchased if I knew it would be so thin.

review/text: I love Earth's Best and I was a little weary of ordering it online. But, everything was great and just what I would expect from this brand. I do have to say that it was not as chunky as I thought it would be. My son is almost 10 months old (only has 2 bottom teeth) and he is somewhat picky about textures, so I mix it with oatmeal and he is a happy camper.

She can eat cereal, which she usually has for breakfast with fruit, however she's gotten bored with it. I got her some of these Earth's Best Oatmeals, which adds some variety to her breakfasts. She seems to like it a lot. I heat it up for 20 seconds in the microwave to make it warm oatmeal. I like the fact that this oatmeal has a lot of iron in it, which is necessary for a growing toddler!!

review/summary: Disgusting! :(
review/text: I bought this for my baby (since she didn't have teeth at the time) thinking that it would be a good source of iron. Unfortunately, the ingredients did not mention that there are RAISINS in this product. The combination of apples, raisins and cinnamon is not a good idea at all. My baby actually started gagging when I put a spoonful in her mouth. When I tasted it myself, I felt like doing the same. This mixture is just too sweet because of the raisins. There is also a very strong flavor of cinnamon. I usually add some cinnamon to the food she eats so I know that she likes cinnamon if its in a normal quantity. I tried diluting the flavor in several ways, but it's no use. The cinnamon flavor was still too strong. I still have about 8 more jars to experiment with. I'm thinking I'll give it one more try by mixing apple puree with a little bit of this mixture and see if the baby will take it or not. Otherwise, it's all going in the trash. I hate wasting food but there doesn't seem to be another option.

Remember, like any food product, the liquid separates sometimes and you just have to stir the food.  No big deal.  Problem solved.  If you still have an issue with it, I would recommend adding a few drops of water or formula to the food. Then stir again.

review/summary: My favorite balsamic cream I tried from Amazon so far
review/text: I first encountered Balsamic Cream in England a few years ago. When I was in Italy March 2008, I bought Mazzetti Balsamico Cremoso at a grocery store, which was wonderful and reasonably priced. Earlier this year I bought a couple varieties on Amazon, and I just bought a few more for holiday gifts, not all of which are making the cut! Here are my personal views of the ones I bought:<br /><br />#1 Casa Rinaldi Crema di Balsamico Blanco (white). This is not the dark Balsamic Cream I have had before, but of all the ones I've now tasted, this is my favorite. It is the perfect balance of vinegar and sweet, the texture is thick, but the flavor is light. Wonderful! ($11.95 for 8 oz from [...])<br /><br />#2 De Negris Balsamico Glaze - also a great flavor, balancing vinegar and sweet, but much thinner texture. Fine for dipping bread etc. ($11/7.3 oz) ($10/13.5 oz on Amazon)<br /><br />#3Da Magreta Acetaia Real Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modena (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena): second best flavor and thicker ($23/16.9 oz)<br /><br />#4 Modenaceti Balsamic Gkaze: thicker, good flavor, but more grapey than the others above. (3x13.5oz for $28)<br /><br />I also tasted Earthy Delights, which was thick and more tangy/vinegary than the others above. I'll use what I have, but probably not buy more. $14.50/500ml<br /><br />For my taste I would not again purchase Mussini Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modeno (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena - sweet, grapey, caramel-y" and don't know what to do with Roland Balsamic Glaze (thick, but very, very vinegary - ugh).

review/text: Many people need to reduce salt intake and this has been the best solution for me. Very versatile. I sometimes bring some to a restaurant and order my food unseasoned.<br /><br />I got turned on to basalmic glaze when Trader Joes carried their own brand which was great... but they discontinued it due to problems with the cap. And I suspect some customers like me hoarded some, reducing apparent demand for long stretches. The cap and no spill dispensing on De Nigris brand is first rate.<br /><br />I bought Roland and De Nigris, and one other. The Roland one comes in several quality levels, the highest of which is hard to find and expensive. I am on this site to buy more De Nigris Basalmic Glaze Reduction because it provides the best taste and the price is right in a good sized bottle.

review/summary: The name says it all
review/text: These are some of the largest seeds I've ever seen.  They have ruined me for other brands.  The shells of these sunflower seeds are almost square in section, and they pop open like they are on a hinge.  The buffalo wing flavor is nice.  It's not melt your face off hot.  I don't know if these have any less sodium than the standard salted variety, but they don't seem to have the "cure your mouth like a country ham" effect I've experienced with the salted flavors.  You may not have experienced this effect if you eat human sized portions, but if you have a 5 oz. bag a day habbit like myself, you probably know what I'm talking about.

review/summary: OK, but Bacon is much better.
review/text: This bag of seeds is good, but not great. I don't know if its inherent in the process of adding the Franks Red Hots Sauce flavor, but sometimes random seeds taste stale or sorta wet/bitter. I would suggest buying the Sizzling Bacon Flavor, it has both spice and flavor. Plus, most importantly, the Bacon Flavor seeds are consistently good throughout the bag. my 2c

review/summary: Great mixed with sizzlin bacon flavor
review/text: Any of the Bigs brand seeds are better than the rest no matter the flavor! I like mixing these hot sauce ones with the sizzlin bacob flavir because i dont like the hot factor just the tangy flavor. So mixing the bacon and buffalo together makes them less hot and they taste even better! Although the dill are still my favorite. I have to search every gas station and store in hopes of finding this rare brand. Spitz brand are easy to find and are okay but have too many worm holes/bad seeds. Bigs virtually has none. Awesome size, quality, taste, and flavor selection! A must have for any sunflower seed addict like myself :)

review/text: I've been buying Davids for a long time, first time I've tried BIGS and the bigs stands for big seeds.  This flavor isn't that great, I'd rather have something different.  But this brand blows away Davids in my opinion.  Davids also has a larger seed line, but I haven't seen any flavors I like on amazon.  I'll continue to buy bigs, but next time I'm getting a different flavor.

review/text: I have been a sunflower seed aficionado for quite a few years.  I was turned on to the BIGS brand a couple of years ago and tried a sampler pack when I fell in love with these seeds.  The Buffalo Wing flavor is nicely balanced - not really hot - but it does have the vinegary hot sauce flavor that you would expect.  The size and quality of the seeds themselves are great.  If you like sunflower seeds and you like buffalo wings - you can't go wrong.

That would have been fine if the Frank's spice kicked in, but alas, I'm just left with a tiny tingle on my tongue from the "spice"... these need WAY more spicy buffalo sauce flavor if they're gonna advertise it as such.

review/summary: Not that Hot...
review/text: When I got these seeds, I was kind of disappointed, the main reason being that they were not hot enough for me. I put one seed in my mouth just to try them out and they tasted like regular flaver. I can really only taste the Frank's when I stick an entire handful in my mouth and its still not that spicy.<br />I just tried this brand out because the Jalepeno Davids were out of stock but since I was so use to those, these just could match up to the level of spicyness that the Jalap's had.<br />The seeds are, however, really big(compared to David's) and are much better quality. They are definatly better than the original flavor of David's.<br />My team loves these seeds so I guess they cant be that bad.<br />And the resealable bag is a nice perk .

review/text: I LOVE these seeds.  I have been a David Jalepeno fan for a long time, but found these browsing amazon and decided to give them a shot.  When I first put them in my mouth I thought "hmmm, this really needs more buffalo flavor."  However, as I continued to eat them over several days, I realized that what I was missing was just a TON of salt like David uses.  I can eat these seeds all day long without shredding my mouth with all the salt.  That always happens to me with David.  I've gotten hooked on the flavor of not only the spices but of the seed as well.  They are fairly big seeds (though not as big as David Jumbo seeds - but who wants a seed you can only get in salt flavor?), and they taste great.

I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because they were nicely sized, good quality seeds and I liked the fact that these were not overly salty like some seeds can be.

I will say, these aren't as hot as the Davids, but the flavor is very good. David's tend to make my tongue hurt after eating them for a while, and these don't do that as much, which is nice. I bought a 12 pack, and they last for a really long time. Much better than a bag of chips for a snack.

review/summary: The BEST customer service and great coffee!
review/text: My first order of alohaislandcoffee.com was the Light Roast 100% Kona pods.  I had just bought the Bunn My Cafe machine.  The coffee tasted bitter to me, not smooth like I'd hoped.  I was ready to return the Bunn My Cafe and give up on pod coffee. I called Anita at Alohaisland and she talked with me and gave me great info on over-extraction, pod brewers, Kona, different roasts.  She asked me to hold on the Bunn one more week and she would send me a sample pack with more pods so I could decide.  She assured me that the Bunn My Cafe was not the reason I didnt like the Light Roast Kona.  Anita was correct!  After trying 4 more flavors(Choco Macadamia Nut, Dark Roast, Espresso, and Hazelnut)we loved them all!  Finally we had the rich smooth coffee that we had hoped for.  If you are not sure which flavor pods to order first, just call Alohaisland, talk with them and they will help you decide.  I have loved Dunkin Donuts coffee for years, thinking it was a light roast.  I learned that its a dark roast and thats why I didnt like the Light Roast Kona.  I highly recommend the Chocolate Macadamia Nut pods!!!

review/summary: kona light roast is the 'pop' version of the best coffee in the world
review/text: Man, if you have never drank Kona coffee, and you have a senseo or a similar coffee pod machine, you must try these!  Sure, they are as expensive as it gets as far as coffee is concerned, but, if you really want a unique experience, and you really love coffee, you will be surprised at the subtleties of true Kona coffee.  You don't have to be a conisseur of coffee to appreciate the flavor, just a lover of the stuff.  The light roast much subtler than the dark roast, and much more enjoyable to the less than hardcore coffee nut, which makes these particular pods a great try for folks new to the Kona coffee market.  I have no idea why coffees from different regions taste so much different, and I really don't even care!  All I know is that coffee from Hawaii, especially Kona coffee, it is the best I have tasted so far, and I even think it is worth the huge amounts of cash it costs to drink it...<br /><br />If the cost is too much, or you don't love coffee, then leave this stuff alone.  Otherwise, you are in for a treat!

review/text: I find this to be the closest more natural sweetener to using sugar for my hot or cold beverages.  It is at least twice as sweet as sugar so one level teaspoon works for me where I might of used 2 rounded teaspoons of sugar. For people who wish to save some money on this, since it is pricy, I find that mixing this 50/50 with Splenda for baking, which is a granulated mix of sugar and Splenda, works very well and is hard to tell its not really just plain old sugar. And also keeps the one teaspoon proportion. So in one teaspoon you are only actually using 1/4 teaspoon of sugar, for anyone who is watching their sugar intake, plus that 1/4 teaspoon is the sweetness equivalent of 2 teaspoons of sugar.

THe best. You will not be dissapointed.

review/summary: Timothy's Chamomile Tea for Keurig is Awful
review/text: Absolutely terrible. I like chamomile, this is disgusting. Terribly bitter, and just not right. Actually, I have tried a number of Keurig teas and many of them are way bitter, or otherwise just not good. Guess tea needs to be brewed like it's supposed to be.<br /><br />Also, why are some of these reviews about Chai? Guess the seller uses the same item number when they run out so they don't have to create a new listing from scratch?

review/summary: overall ok
review/text: if you want to use the pod instead of loose leaf, this is a good choice, quite weak if you use the travel mug size on your keurig b70 but the standard size is decent enough
