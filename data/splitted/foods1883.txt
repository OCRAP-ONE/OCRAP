review/summary: Nice drink!
review/text: I first bought a Java teeccino at my local health co-op.  I liked it a lot, but was curious about the other flavors.  So I got the sampler pack from teeccino online so I could try all the flavors.<br /><br />Vanilla nut is a nice flavor.  Truthfully some of the flavors do not seem to be differentiated from each other, but this one definitely has it's own flavor profile.  I keep coming up with "vanilla coconut" when I taste it.  If you are looking for something to taste as close as possible to Coffee - this isn't the flavor.  I would suggest Maya Caffe for the closest flavor to coffee.  But this vanilla nut is very enjoyable in its own right.<br /><br />This beverage is a nice alternative to coffee.  No it does not taste like coffee exactly.  It has it's own taste and feel.  But I'm finding that I REALLY enjoy drinking it for the flavor it does have.  The only negative aspect is that it does contain more calories than coffee or tea.  However, the way I feel after I drink it (in comparison to coffee) far outweighs the small calorie content.<br /><br />I use 1 TB in my french press and about 12oz of water boiled in my tea kettle.  Such a quick, easy, inexpensive and enjoyable method of brewing.<br /><br />I would reccommend the sampler pack (free shipping) from the teeccino website and then order your favorite flavors through subscribe and save on amazon.  That will give you the best price.

review/summary: It's Not Coffee But's It's Really Good
review/text: This is my second time trying Teeccino and I must say the more I drink it the better I like it. As I've gotten older, coffee is having adverse effects my digestive track and it's not been good so I need something else and tea just doesn't cut it. Teeccino seems to be about as close to coffee as one can get without being coffee. The mint was really good and this vanilla nut may even be better. Teeccino doesn't leave that bad aftertaste coffee gives you (even the really good stuff) and it seems to give a slight energy boost. Nothing like coffee though. No brain stimulation. I think the energy comes from the inulin. I did some research on inulin and I suggest you do the same. I'm still not sure if it's a good thing or not. Some say yes and others no. It doesn't seem to have a negative effect on me as of yet. If you need to get off of coffee or hot chocolate or your just tired of drinking tea give Teeccino a try. I think you'll be quite pleased. Oh yea... I put honey and milk in mine and it's really good that way.<br /><br />I've been making a pitcher at the beginning of the week and keeping it in the fridge. It seems to keep very well. It's easier to heat up a cup on the stove in the morning so I don't wake the entire house with the noise of the coffee maker or microwave.

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: Last summer I was informed by my allergist that I was allergic to coffee. I LOVE coffee, so this was a huge downer for me. I quit drinking coffee and feel much better for it but honestly, tea, hot water and other coffee substitutes just don't have the same satisfying bold taste that coffee does. A friend suggested Teeccino and I thought, "why not? I've tried everything else." I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!! At first, I drip brewed it in my coffee pot according to the instructions (1 TBSP. per 2 cups water) and it didn't really taste like coffee... kind of but not quite. I have been playing with the mixture and have found that 1 1/2 TSP. per 5 cups of water makes the drink taste EXACTLY like coffee!! Now my mornings are complete again!

review/summary: Not coffee, but excellent replacement
review/text: I started researching this product b/c I was trying to purge my body of caffeine and a few other man-made, unnatural ingredients to give my liver a break. It does not taste like coffee, but still goes very well as a drink INSTEAD of coffee, any time you would normally drink coffee - in the morning, sitting at your desk, after dessert, etc. I have made it in a french press as well as made espresso shots with it for lattes. Its texture is like coffee, but with a little fruitier and nutty flavor. It does wake you up some just b/c its an enjoyable, non-dairy, hot drink that doesn't seem to dehydrate you like caffeine and alcohol products.<br /><br />For those with sensitive stomachs - this product is alkaline (opposite of coffee which is acidic) and is GOOD for you. My girlfriend stomach does "flips" after drinking acidic beverages, and this product does NOT cause that. Even mixing half Teeccino and half regular coffee seemed to be enough to neutralize the coffee's acidity and allow her to enjoy her beverage (which actually tastes really good mixed half and half).

Vanilla is one of my favorites and the hubby never knew the difference, also according to their website--this herbal coffee is good for you!

review/text: I was really excited about this because I've had to stop drinking coffee because of IBS and other digestive sensitivity. I really was surprised how much it really taste like coffee! However...a few hours later my stomach bloated up and hurt for a few hrs. I read the label and saw that barley was the culprit. All in all its a great coffee alternative...but not for people with extreme gluten sensitivity.

review/summary: Gluten free or not?! Check their website!
review/text: It appalls me that companies can claim their products are gluten free and then go on to say that some people do have a reaction from them!  All experienced gluten suffers know to read ingredients and know that BARLEY is a no-no, yet this company claims that it is gluten free, people new to gluten sensitivities may not know this and having the company say this is gluten free is very deceiving. After going to their website and looking up the Q&A's, I found that the company says it has been tested and MOST people don't have a reaction but admit that some people do.  Sorry, but I think that alone should be enough to take off the claim of being gluten free.<br /><br />Thankfully I did not buy this product, but I want to put this review up because when I was first diagnosed, I didn't know that barley was a no-no and and only when with companies claiming "gluten free" and did myself a lot of harm.  I am trying to save others the same harm, or better yet, have the company remove the Gluten Free status!

review/summary: Excellent hot drink even for non-coffee lovers!
review/text: Got free samples of Mocha Java, Maya Cafe and Vanilla Nut from my doctor's office.  Liked them all and Vanilla Nut the best.  Ordered from Amazon.  Now finding I head for Vanilla Nut Teeccino when I want a midday "treat" instead of my usual cup of tea.  It has a mild but distinctively yummy flavor.<br /><br />Plan to add Maya Cafe to the next order, for when I want a more neutral coffee-like drink.  Didn't find much taste difference in Mocha Java so will pass on that one. Sometimes I use cream although it doesn't need it; just depends on what taste sensation you prefer.<br /><br />I'd recommend having either flavor on hand instead of decaf for late night coffee drinkers sensitive to caffeine.  They might enjoy the pleasant change.<br /><br />It took me awhile to convert from hi-test to half decaf to decaf coffee.  But the switch from decaf to Teeccino was painless and satisfying!

review/summary: Tastes really great, but horrible if you have celiac disease
review/text: I was really excited when I heard about teeccino because I have terrible heartburn, but I love coffee.  I also have celiac disease and I saw on the label that it is gluten free.  When I brought it home, I read the ingredients and it listed barley.  I was pretty upset about this, but on the bag it said it still was gluten free even though it had barley.  Just for laughs, I went to the website and it says if you use a coffee filter it will filter out the barley.  What a bunch of BS.  I tried it the first time and I felt like I got kicked in the gut really hard when I was at my last sip, but I felt better about 2 hours later and I wasn't AS SICK as I normally get when I have gluten.  So I thought...well maybe I should give it another try with another type of filter.  Bad idea.  worst idea ever.  I got SOOOO sick.  Sicker than I've ever been. It took me two days to recover. I honestly think it's EVIL to mislead people like this.  This company should be sued.  I would give it five stars for the taste, but when it comes to my health, I don't give a damn about how something tastes.  I would give it zero stars if I could.  Stop lying to people Teeccino!

review/summary: I love this!!!
review/text: I picked up a bag of this at the health food store yesterday. I have given up caffeine due to a mild heart arrhythmia and was actually looking for some high quality decaf. But, it was very expensive and the Teecino was half the price (on sale), so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! I am very much enjoying this beverage (with a little milk or almond milk.) I have explored the company website, too, and learned that even decaf coffee may contribute to heart arrhythmia. The health information provided by the company website was convincing and I feel that switching to this will be a healthy change for me. I also found out that they have about 16 flavors, so I have ordered a sampler and looking forward to trying the others. I usually bake biscotti to give to friends for Christmas and I'm thinking of buying a couple more variety sets and including a couple of samples with each gift.<br /><br />I'm glad to see that this product is available through subscribe and save here at Amazon. I do really like the Vanilla Nut, and once I know what other flavors I like best, I'll be ordering here. Oh, and it's "Made in America", too...

review/summary: Worst pumpkin seeds I ever bought
review/text: The order arrived in the stated delivery time frame and in good condition. That was the only thing satisfactory about this order and the only reason it got one star. The pumpkin seeds were very over toasted and covered in a white powder that turned to a paste consistency when wet. I have brought pumpkin seeds from many vendors and have never encountered this white powder. I suspect the powder was added to cover up the fact that the seeds were so very over toasted that they turned brown. I tossed these pumpkin seeds in the trash and suggest that no on e buys from this vendor.

review/summary: Kong Paste
review/text: This stuff is fabulous.  I have a real chewer, and she knows how to break up the cookies almost immediately by throwing the Kong against the walls and into the air.  By spraying some paste on the inside walls of the Kong, she has to spend some extra time with it, keeping her busy longer!  They absolutely love this stuff - I can hide them anywhere and they know the minute they enter the room that they're around.  Wonderful product.

review/text: All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin-enriched "tasty pastes" available from Kong.  Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before, we found that they really got into it when we inserted some of the paste into the cavity.  All of them go "nuts" when we put down the "pasty Kongs" for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do!<br /><br />I would highly recommend all of Kong's "tasty pastes" - it's easy to use, doesn't seem to make any mess, and is a great extra treat for dogs.  Our 3 give it "2 paws up"!

review/text: WE loved this for our dog, at first. Unfortunately after a few uses, his abdomen became distended, he became flatulent (and very stanky, yes STANKY), and had loose stools. Not exactly something you want in a large dog. Peanut butter will be on our shopping list from now on; it's cheaper and works so much better.

review/summary: Oh, the gas! The horrible, horrible gas...
review/text: Let's get one thing straight first: dogs love this stuff. I mean they REALLY LOVE IT. Not just my puppy, but every dog in my office - the second this stuff comes out, my desk is surrounded by noses that smelled it from across the office. And they want it so bad they'll watch wistfully as my puppy devours it, just a little bit, from his Kong. When he's done, they get in line to steal the Kong and the lucky one will spend several minutes working on it just in case there's any left.<br /><br />By the end of the afternoon, I am choking on the odor that rises at regular intervals from under my desk in nearly visible clouds of pure dog fart stench. By the time we get home, even the puppy will stop in his tracks every few minutes and startle at his own rear end, not entirely sure what's going on back there but knowing it's probably not good. By the end of the evening I am swearing to myself once again that tomorrow, no matter how desperate I am to occupy him and get some work done, I won't give this stuff to the puppy and turn him into a 6.5lb tactical nuke.<br /><br />I think today was the last time he'll be getting it, and the rest of the can is going in the trash. It's just not worth it!

However when it came, it was pepperoni flavor instead of fresh breath- the exact opposite!! :-O  However, the dogs still enjoyed it, although I won't order it online again since its a little bit cheaper at walmart- and I can be sure to get the right flavor!<br /><br />However, overall this Kong filler is awesome to keep our 2 large dogs entertained for a little while during the day- and they love it!

review/text: Although the product can be a bit pricey, it can be worth it.  I put a Kong liver snap treat (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DHNY6">KONG Stuff'N Snacks, Liver, 11-Ounce, Large</a>) in the Kong (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8">KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Large, Red</a>) first, then "anchor" it with the liver paste.  I stick the whole thing in the freezer for a few hours to a few weeks, until I want to give it to my dog.  Freezing makes it last 20-30 minutes instead of the 20-30 seconds it would take her to empty the Kong if it wasn't frozen.<br /><br />She is terrified of thunderstorms, and will keep us up with pacing, barking, howling and whining if not distracted.  This stuff will distract her from ANYTHING.  Then I can sleep...ZZZzzzzzzzz.........

review/text: This paste gave BOTH my dogs diarrhea each time I used it. It's also got disgusting fillers. The price is WAY too high for how little use you get out of each can. Just buy a large peanut butter or cream cheese or throw left over chicken in the Kong and freeze it. Why pay this if you can get 20x the use out of a jar of peanut butter? I only caved because I had been curious for months AND it went on sale.

review/summary: Careful with this!
review/text: When I first discovered this product, and how my Toy Fox Terrier puppy reacted to it, I was thrilled.  It was so hard to get her to slow down and do some productive chewing while I was busy.  However, I did notice that her stool was often a bit loose after eating this "puppy goo".  I started stuffing her Kong with kibbles to make sure there was substance and not just the gooey stuff, in hopes that I wouldn't have to take it away from her totally.  It seemed to work for a little while, then suddenly, pools of stool again.  Even when I froze the stuff, it didn't help.  Only gave her one a week, didn't help.  It may be that toy breeds have a difficult time with it and heartier dogs will be fine.  But be cautious.<br /><br />One further note:  I've noticed that the textural contents of the cans vary.  Not sure how or why.  Be wary of expiration dates!

review/text: My dog takes supplements everyday and has for many years. Used to use peanut butter and have used all types. Never really liked doing that because of all the sugar in it. Have tried spreadable cheese too but it's too rich for her system. So saw this while ordering other Kong products and thought I'd give it a try. She's always a little combative but she takes them none the less using this stuff and it doesn't mess up her digestive system. Texture is a little runny even though I refrigerate it but still able to coat her pills well enough with it.

review/summary: Very Happy!
review/text: I'm very glad I found these dental chews. I'm leery of giving my whippet puppy Greenies considering all of the issues dogs were having with them awhile back. This product however, met all of my expectations! It's made in America, contains quality ingredients, and my puppy enjoys chewing on them (he loves apples). He has a fairly sensitive stomach and these bones did not appear to give him any tummy issues. I found that size of these bones fit perfectly with the size of my 35lb whippet. The only downside I had was that these bones are not cheap. I don't like to take chances with my dog's health however, so I am willing to spend a little more for better quality treats. As long as he continues to enjoy these, I will continue buying them.

While the original gum-balls I had for my machine were large, these are a bit smaller than I expected.. but I have found that I enjoy the size and taste of these MUCH more than any other gum-balls I have purchased.<br /><br />And it isn't just me, my friends literally twist and twist and TWIST the dial on my machine trying like mad to get as many into their mouths as they can... yes, they are that delicious.

review/text: I have been buying gumballs for my bank for the grandkids for years.This time I ordered four bags and when I got them I couldnt believe it. All the yellow ones were hollow, no gum inside, also some of the white ones were empty. I had to throw them away. I think I should get some kind of a credit!

review/summary: My slim-down drink of choice.
review/text: I've spent a lot of years drinking diet drinks, and while I did get in better shape by cutting out the sugar, I realized something: Carbonated diet drinks tend to make my stomach burn, which feels very similar to hunger. After converting to drinking this, I'm finding it a lot easier to avoid snacking and the drink doesn't make me feel like reaching for more snacks.<br /><br />I've had other diet green teas, and if you've had Lipton with lemon, this is entirely different. Calorie free and a slight honey taste, it's made with Splenda and don't have the high acidity or aftertaste that I've had with other diet green teas. It doesn't taste like regular tea, but it doesn't have the telltale green tea taste that some others do have.<br /><br />I drink this stuff and it helps satiate my thirst and curb my hunger.  Problem solved.

Very litlle mushroom too.  I got this at $7 for 4 jars, so it wasn't too bad.  But I won't be buying these again.  I don't know if company is cutting back on ingredients but buy smaller jars at the grocery store, they may be packed chunkier and more mushroom than these big jars.

review/summary: Great little cookies
review/text: These cookies taste like Nabisco's Ginger snaps, only with oatmeal and cinnamon.  They have a "snap" consistency to them, meaning they do bend when you bite them, but then *snap* off, so they are both chewy and crispy at the same time. They use raisin paste, which is good, because then you don't have to worry about digestion problems later with eating whole raisins with the oatmeal, plus it tastes better in my opinion. These cookies are not sold in stores, which is rather odd.  I first found these when I gave blood, and they had them out for donors to eat.  I figured I try them, since they were there and free. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Cookies come as individually wrapped packages of two.  Great with milk.

review/text: I just LOVE the taste of these cookies.  Although there's no "whole" raisins in the cookie, the flavor is addicting.  However, Nabisco should keep an eye on the manufacturing and packaging.  11 of the 100 pkgs in the box only had ONE cookie in it, while others were broken into pieces.  Thumbs down for quality assurance - thumbs up for flavor!

review/summary: Perfect Little Cookie
review/text: I decided to try these cookies since they are individually wrapped (actually 2 cookies in a pack) so i knew this would help with portion control. when I ordered, I wasn't sure if you got 100 cookies total or 100 packs (200 cookies), so I was pleasantly surprised to get 100 packs. They have a great taste to them with a hint of cinnamon and a nice crunch which I enjoy. The only things that I have noticed is there are no big raisins in them. It seems more like a raisin paste to me. That's not a big deal to me, but that may matter to some. There is also no nutritional information on them, which is disappointing. All in all, I really like them and will be ordering them again.

review/summary: Could not live without this tea!
review/text: I literally could not live without the Monthly Comfort tea. A friend recommended it to me for "the time of the month" and I tried it skeptically - especially as I am not a mother, a soon to be mother, or motherly at all. I start drinking at least a cup of this three to four days before my cycle, and find that most of the monthly annoyance of being a woman subsides. What was a week of unpleasantness, with two days of insomnia because the pain is so bad has no turned into a day or two max of light cramps, with no bloating either.<br /><br />To me it tastes like cinnamon and ginger, with raspberry undertones. It tastes delicious enough that I often have it all month long, not just on my cycle. It's especially pleasant on a chilly morning.<br /><br />I buy this in bulk now, because running out is simply not an option!

review/text: I've battled horrific periods for years, especially after the birth of my second child.  I wish I would have known about this many years ago!  This tea is absolutely fantastic.  I typically have issues with gaining upwards of 10 lbs of water weight during my menstrual cycle - not this time.  Cramping is significantly reduced, water weight is non-existent, even my husband commented on my much improved monthly demeanor.<br /><br />The tea is easy to make, though I would certainly recommend steeping for a solid 15 minutes for best results.  I drink two cups of this tea each day (morning and afternoon) starting a few days before my cycle and all the way through.  I do not normally enjoy tea, but I have to say, this is delicious.  I didn't even need to add sugar or other sweetener to mask the taste.<br /><br />I have used most of the Earth Mama tea products, and have been impressed by the high quality, delicious flavors, and natural remedies for my ails.  I highly recommend giving this product a try.
