review/summary: Not great sticky rice
review/text: This is more like sushi rice than sticky rice.  It is somewhat sticky but not really sticky.  I prefer the "Thai Sticky Rice (Sweet Rice) 5 Lbs" which is also available on Amazon at a slightly higher price point, but it is worth it.  Now I have to finish this 10 lb bag before I get more sticky rice.  This is very short grain white rice.  I cooked it in my Zojirushi pressure cooker and it did not turn out as well as the Thai Sticky rice cited earlier.  Grown in California it says?  Maybe sticky rice is better grown in the Far East and Southeast.

review/text: I'd have given this Florida Crystals Natural sugar a five star rating but it is the clumpiest sugar I have ever used.  Huge clumps.  I should have taken my clue from the photo, since I saw that it was kind of clumpy.<br /><br />On the bright side, it is a great tasting sugar, and I like the fact that it is natural.

review/summary: Really great for baking
review/text: For me, the only use for this is baking or making chocolate sauces out of it.  It's just too bitter to eat plain and it doesn't really taste much until your mouth melts it.  That is, if you chew it up, it's pretty much tasteless until it melts in your mouth.  At that point, however, it's just too bitter for me.  I made a chocolate sauce with cream and a little sugar and it was wonderful over ice cream, and even just plain (the little bit of sugar cuts the bitterness a lot).  By the way, be prepared to chop the pieces.  As is, they are a little large for anything, unless you're just going to melt them in a double boiler.

review/summary: nice no-caffeine tisane
review/text: Appearance: the leaves and stem pieces are rough and cut into lengths similar to many teas.  Some twigs were present. Liquor: dark green (greener than a true tea will be). Smell: vegetal and earthy. Taste: as with the smell, this tisane is vegetal and earthy, with sweet grassy notes, and a slightly roasted flavor. The taste is sufficiently tea-like that it caused psychosomatic effects for a friend who had given up caffeine for health reasons.  The tisane does not have tannins, so you can steep it for as long as you want without it becoming bitter. I think that it's tastiest after about 5 minutes, but a shorter infusion can work. I really like this one straight or blended with mint.

review/text: Weber's Italian Herb Marinade has been an essential ingredient for our summer meals for the past few years -- ever since I discovered it.  Chicken, pork, even seafoods or salmon are delicious prepared with this easy to prepare marinade.  Olive oil, water, and white vinegar added to the packet of seasoning and you have a wonderful tasting main entre.  No overpowering spices, just a sensational, mouthwatering combination of flavors.  Though this is my favorite, I also enjoy the White Wine and Herb, Tequila Lime, as well as Tomato Pesto.<br />Usually available on the Weber site, the marinades were easy to order and swiftly delivered through Amazon.

review/text: Key Lime is outstanding of all the variety of citrous juices. In addition to the traditional mixed drink and Key Lime pie usage -- I find it great for hot or ice tea as well as to greatly enhance favorite sodas such as ginger ales. It is also good that it is so strong -- so it takes only a bit for most usage. This set of three bottles is convenient to have a good amount ready with the rest kept fresh in sealed bottles. This "Manhattan Key Lime Juice" is indeed an excellent variant of rich tart Key Lime -- with the most special piquant quality of Key Lime +++

The flavor is not overpowering at all and I did not notice any weird smell or chemical taste.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/24/12: I recently purchased more of these and the new ones did have a chemical taste.  Maybe it was a bad batch?  I always loved these in the past, but the most recent bottles I purchased were not good at all.  They were not expired, so I am not sure what caused the bad taste, but I will most likely not purchase them again.

review/text: I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the "Cucumber Essence" is very strong in this water.  Much more than the hint you would find in the Cucumber water at the spas and it does have a somewhat odd chemical-type smell particularly when not served ice cold.<br /><br />I love cucumber so it's not terrible if I mix equal parts plain water with it.  Still a strong odor, but not as bad.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't order this flavor again unless the Cucumber hint was greatly reduced.  I have tried the Pomegranate-Orange Hint Water which was fantastic and refreshing but is apparently not sold on Amazon.

review/text: I feel like this K-cup variety has been unnecessarily & harshly criticized both on Amazon and the Keurig site. It's kind of like a sweetened caffeinated hot chocolate. It's like what you'd expect a kid to order in a coffee shop or like a decaf starbuck's speciality drink. If you like those sorts of sweet drinks from coffee stores then you'll like this. The coffee flavour is weak, if you prefer starbucks drinks with 2 shots of espresso... you're not gonna like this. I think it's something you can drink in the afternoon or at night that isn't going to keep you up. If you prefer a bolder coffee taste go for some of the cappuccino k-cups.

But as I was drinking the first one I could tell right away that there was something artificial. Turns out these have Sucralose (a.k.a Splenda) in them in addition to real sugar. Why use both?<br /><br />Also, I agree with another reviewer who said it really just tastes like hot chocolate. I could hardly taste any coffee flavor at all.<br /><br />Very disappointing. :(

review/text: I just love my Keurig coffee maker.  I find myself drinking coffee at home instead of buying expensive drinks at my neighborhood Starbucks.  I always loved their cafe mocha, but it is just loaded with calories.  I was thrilled when I found this product.  It is low in calories and delicious.  If you are a Weight Watchers person, you can have a cup of this with some fat free whipped topping for just two points.  Incredible.  I have it as a mid afternoon treat.

review/text: People are complaining of the lack of coffee taste and too-chocletey taste, well what do you expect when you order MOCHA?  It's delicious, and lives up to it's name of MOCHA with a hint of coffee.  If you want coffee, order that.  This is a pleasure drink, at only 60 calories though, it's a bargain!

review/summary: One sip and dumped the cup!
review/text: Cafe mocha, I mean who doesn't enjoy a sweet cup of coffee with a delicious chocolate overtone. I sure do. I dream of them and looked forward to trying this. This was a nightmare :P  &lt;--- that was exactly what my face looked liked.<br /><br />I wish companies would be at least label their products that have artificial sweetener... as in this case sucralose. Sucralose has a nasty after and beginning taste in my opinion. I don't ever buy products intentionally that have this in it. If you don't mind sucralose, then it probably wouldn't bother you.<br /><br />However, if you dare to continue and try your own cup. Let me warn you. It doesn't have a coffee flavor. Or maybe a mild one.I couldn't get passed the sucralose taste. It is instant coffee as well. (no grinds in the filter left)<br /><br />As suggested by others stick to the reg. coffee and add some Andes mints or your own favorite hot chocolate to it.

review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: I purchased the Cafe Mocha when Amazon was having a sale on the pack of 3, otherwise, the regular price is much to expensive and not worth it.  The mocha was good, but a bit too sweet for my taste, so I mixed it with a small (espresso shot) k-cup of regular coffee, which made it taste like a mocha from Starbucks. You can also get the same taste if you use a k-cup of hot chocolate and combine it with a k-cup of regular or decaf coffee... and it will still be less costly than the Cafe Escapes at regular price.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy with the product and would continue to buy, if only the price was better.

review/text: I know people have knocked this in other reviews, but I actually think its pretty good stuff. Yes, if you can accept that it really is a powdered drink (There isn't real coffee in this, the cup is just filled with powder that dissolves in the hot water), you'll love it!. I have no idea if it really has caffeine, but I think its got a great taste. I keep a box around for people that don't like regular coffee, and everyone has loved it. I'll even have one from time to time if I want a sugar fix.

review/text: I think these must be instant coffee b/c the cups feel empty when they're done, unlike the coffee ones which feel a little heavier b/c of the grounds and filter inside. Anyway, they taste like instant coffee and hot chocolate - not the greatest combination. I would also like it to be a bit creamier. With some creamer added they are tolerable. I won't buy them again, too bad I bought 24.

The 18-Count Packs run about $11-$12 per Pack in stores so you're not saving any money here by buying 3 12-Count Packs but on the other hand, they always seem to be out of stock in my local stores so the convenience of being able to order it through Amazon was a plus and delivery was very quick!

review/summary: More synthetic than Joan River's face!
review/text: I had the opportunity to try out Cafe Escapes' Cafe Mocha k cups when my boyfriend's sister gave us a couple of hers to try.  I was a little wary to begin with because I'd tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IPJTZE">Swiss miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup, Milk Chocolate, 12-Count</a> and remained unconvinced that chocolate flavored powders do well in the Keurig brewing system.  But since this was a chance to try a mixture of both chocolate and coffee, I couldn't turn it down.<br /><br />Unfortunately the final result was much like the Swiss Miss... way too fake!  Almost a plastic-like flavor.  Just awful.  The coffee side of the mizture was either too weak or watery because the mocha just tasted like watered down hot chocolate with a (very) little bit of bite to it.  Nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I'm glad I was able to try a sample of these pods rather than spending money on a box only to be disappointed.  I think a great alternative would be to brew a cup of your favorite blend of coffee and then add in a spoonful of your favorite hot chocolate.  A bit more effort, but the payoff will be leaps and bounds better than this one.<br /><br />This k cup is a pass for me.

review/summary: Great Flavor and Value
review/text: I hadn't had coffee in over 20 months and only needed a small excuse to start again.  The new Keurig Coffee Maker and the Cafe Mocha provided the motive.  The Mocha is rich and tasty.  Very nice on cold winter mornings.  My wife loves them as well.  Great combination...

review/summary: Not really as good as you'd expect
review/text: I bought this because what I expect out of a Mocha coffee drink is, well coffee with a chocolate flavor. This is a hot chocolate drink with a little bit of coffee flavor (which I cant really pick up on but some non coffee drinkers were able to). Ingredients list basically the milk hot chocolate mix cafe escapes uses and toward the end just says "instant coffee". We all have different taste its true, and while drinkable this really wasn't close to the coffee shop quality mocha drink I was hoping for, but at less than 50 cents a k-cup I'll drink it and save money.

review/summary: It is alright, depends on your taste
review/text: I am not a huge coffee drinker but I need some caffeine every once and a while. This is alright. It does taste like hot chocolate but on the largest cup setting it tastes like chocolate water. The middle setting is alright but I feel it tastes the best on the smallest cup size. Sometime I will mix 2 of the small cups together to get a decent size drink. I am a fan of the Cafe Escapes line as they taste very good and don't make a mess while making. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a small drink!

review/summary: Yummy Sweetness
review/text: This coffee is perfect for someone who likes sweet coffee... not bitter at all... It really is a mocha; so, Don't buy it if you don't like chocolate in your coffee... leans toward a hot chocolate taste. I'm the kind of person who has to have the flavored creamers, but this I can drink just as it is.... or with some flavored syrup- YUM!

review/summary: Doesn't taste like a mocha on its own....
review/text: I bought these hoping to find a way to make a cappuccino-like drink using our Keurig.  This Cafe Mocha K-cup on its own tastes like hot chocolate.  It also tastes slightly watery and I really can't taste any coffee at all.  I was bummed since this isn't really what I was looking for.<br /><br />Since the chocolate taste was so strong & the coffee taste was so weak, I decided make a mug filled with half Cafe Mocha and half flavored coffee by selecting the small cup size for each.  Tada!  An at home Mocha!  I will continue to buy these so I can mix them with my other coffees.  If you don't mind using two k-cups per drink, they are a good way to go for a tasty at-home mocha.  If mixing this with another cup seems to expensive or like too much trouble, then skip these ones - I would give them only 1 star on their own.

review/text: I love these k-cups. I prefer my coffee to be sweet and chocolately, and these cups deliver! I have been adding hot chocolate powder mix to my coffee for years, and with this variety, I no longer have to! It saves me an extra step each morning.<br /><br />To the reviewer who complained about these tasting like hot chocolate - that's kinda the point. Mocha = chocolate.<br /><br />Buy them - they are fantastic!

review/text: This is a very good beverage if a little sweet for my taste. I plan to buy it again. I noticed this coffee and many other K-cup products are available in many different package sizes and MANY different costs per serving. Use Amazon's convenient filters to narrow your selection to the price you want and don't forget to look at the shipping cost. I really appreciate some of Amazon's free shipping specials.

review/summary: Worst K-Cup Flavor...Ever!
review/text: We were excited to try try this flavor after being long time fans of this company's Chai Tea.  BIG MISTAKE! To our surprise, this tasted quite funny.  Had my wife sample, and she felt the same.  Tried another cup just to be sure, and it was deja vu all over again.  Has a very bland and ackward taste with no hint of coffee.  Looks like this is the flavor I will be trying to pawn off to guests in order to get rid of!

review/text: There is no coffee in this K-cup. How do I know? The cup is completely empty when the Krueg is done with it. No grinds at all.  That doesn't bother me as much as the fact that it has very little coffee flavor.  That being said...I do enjoy the taste and it is rather good for instant Hot Chocolate.

review/text: I tried this instead of my usual coffee with my own added cocoa powder and sugar.  Blech!  It taste like the garbage you get out of the machines at the gas station.  Actaully worse with the aftertaste.  Wish I had researched first.  Had some coupons, but still not worth what I paid.  I will try as others have suggested and brewing in some real coffee with it.  Otherwise it is just plain disgusting.

review/summary: Mocha-flavored instant coffee
review/text: Expensive mocha-flavored instant coffee k-cups. The flavor is fine, but you can achieve the same effect at a much lower price by swirling a teaspoon of cocoa mix into any cup of coffee. Also, the product description didn't mention sugar in the listed contents, so now I'm looking for someone to give 35 mocha k-cups to.
