review/summary: Sodium Free
review/text: Fantastic flavor enhancer for those of us on low sodium diets. A word of caution, however; salt is replaced by potassium chloride. If you are on a potassium sparing blood pressure medication, You should discuss use of this with your doctor. On the other hand, potassium can help lower blood pressure, and one serving of this product is a healthy dose, similar to that in a potato, or a banana. I take Diovan, and was concerned, but my BP has lowered while incorporating a teaspoon a day in my diet, and I am highly pleased with this product.

review/summary: Sodium free bouillon is a godsend for peoploe on low sodium diets.
review/text: Maintaining a low sodium diet is extremely hard.  Sodium free bouillon helps make things tasty and I am very happy to have this product available.  I only wish it were available in my local stores.  I use both the beef & the chicken bouillon to season vegetables, gravies, and soups.  Because one member of the family is also gluten intollerant, this particular product is especially a boon for me.  Thank you, Hormel for this product.!

review/summary: Worthless
review/text: I was looking for gluten-free, low-sodium beef bouillon granules, because I'm tired of smashing cubes, and the powder in the envelopes costs too much. I use bouillon in cooking and to make onion soup mix, because the packaged stuff contains gluten. What a huge disappointment! The first thing I made with this was a stovetop beef-onion gravy. My husband asked "Where's the beef"?  There was literally zero beef flavor in the gravy. Ok, so what about onion soup mix? I made the mix, whipped up some dip, and again, it tasted nothing like the stuff from the familiar blue box mix. Other bouillon turns out a perfect copycat. The worst thing? I've got 6 jars of this stuff! I guess I'll keep smashing cubes.<br /><br />Bottom line - ZERO Beef Flavor! Look elsewhere.

review/text: I love Sweet Chili Riceworks chips.  I first tried them at Costco, then could not find them again.  I emailed the company and found Walmart was to get some in.  I purchased 6 bags, but once again found they no longer carry them.  I finally found them once again at Amazon after contacting the company.  But I will not be buying from Amazon again.  The chips are nothing but crumbs in the bags and I ordered 12.  They came all crushed, very few whole chips.  I am greatly disapointed.  I love the chips, but would like a local place to purchase.

review/summary: Why mess with a good thing?
review/text: These chips used to be amazing: like nothing else on the market.  I could go through a bag a day all by myself.  They were insanely delicious.  The only minor issue was that a certain amount of the spices they used to flavor them would collect at the bottom of the bag.  So, they decided to "improve" them by reformulating (i.e. changing) the spice mixture so that it would adhere better to the chips.  STUPID!!!  Now, instead of tasting like a product in a class by itself, they taste like a second-rate Doritos.  Unless you have a wheat allergy, there's no longer any really compelling reason to buy these chips as they now taste like any other product on the market.  It's really sad.  I rarely write reviews for anything, but I was so disappointed by this, I just had to mention it.  Why do companies always have to ruin a good thing?  I mean, I'm sure I should thank them for the sake of my hips, but my taste buds are still in mourning.

review/summary: Watch out, these have hydrolyzed protein in them!!!!
review/text: I'm very VERY careful when it comes to putting food into my body. If it isn't natural, then it dosn't belong in the body. These rice chips do taste good, and are a FANTASTIC switch from more proccessed chips (like doritos). These chips, however, do have hydrolyzed protein in them, which is just like MSG. This ingridient isn't natural, and in the long run has been proven to give health problems. I have opted for the Lundberg chips, which do NOT have anything unnatural in them.<br /><br />I'm giving this item 2 stars due to the fact that they are delicious, they are a great substitute for other chips, but fell short of being completely different then those proccesed chips i've learned to hate.

review/text: Try these instead of corn chips which will only go to your hips.  There is still some corn in them but rice flour is the main ingredient.  I like the spice, crunch, finger-lickin' goodness of these flavorful chili chips that don't give me heartburn like potato chips do.  I use the dregs for a spice to my salads or add into turkey meatballs.  With the puffiness of the package the product stays nice when packed for a trip.  The bag is durable too for repeat folding and clipping.  I also like the green package variety with the lime taste by Riceworks and keep both in stock.  Vicki

After one bite of Rice Works Sweet Chili, I was hooked on the spicy-sweet and crunchy flavors.  All the ingredients are even good for me.  When we got home I went on line and found them on Amazon.com.  What a find!!!!  I have shared my purchase with several friends and relatives.  They were an instant favorite.  Apparently, they are not available here in McKinney, TX until summertime. Can't wait.

review/summary: Made from biirch, made in USA
review/text: I am glad to see that more and more companies are manufacturing xylitol, because the sooner it catches on nation-wide, the sooner the prices will drop and become reasonable. Hopefully, xylitol will eventually replace sugar as the sweetener of choice. It shouldn't cost more than sugar does.<br /><br />I like this brand because it is USA made from birch, not corn and not China. No offense to China, but since almost all of our jobs went over there, the quality of Chinese products can be, well, BAD. I try to avoid "made in China" as much as possible and I look for "made in USA." This product satisfies both requisites. And it's excellent.

review/summary: Great product - unstable price
review/text: I tried this product after years of using corn-based xylitol. Even though it is said there are no corn proteins (thus potential allergens) remaining in the final product of corn-based xylitol, and all of the companies I contacted insisted their China-sourced xylitol was organic and free of GMO's, I decided to switch to a birch-based xylitol. None of the corn-based xylitol distributors I contacted could actually "certify" this information, and few will back up their claims in writing on their websites.<br /><br />I also contacted the distributor of this particular product (Zveet) who told me that although their birch trees are not certified organic, they also do not use any chemicals on the trees. This is pretty much what the corn-based, China-sourced xylitol distributors said, and although I might have missed it, I could not find this confirmed on their website either. While I would love to find a xylitol product that certifies such claims, I decided to take them at their word and I tried the product since their product is originating in the US.<br /><br />I found it to be nearly identical to corn-based xylitol with really only two exceptions: the crystals appear slightly larger (which really does not impact anything) and it tastes a bit "cooler". Many people comment on the cool taste of xylitol which I have never noticed until now, and I found it very pleasant. Other than this, it is the same as all the corn-based xylitol I have used. It also has the same level of sweetness, which is somewhat lower than sugar. You can counter this by either adding a bit more xylitol to the product (about 10% seems to do the trick) or by adjusting to a slightly less sweet taste. Birch-based xylitol appears to be the same in calories as corn-based, which  is 40% lower than cane sugar, and better for your health than sugar or fructose over-all. I use xylitol along with a bit of Himalayan Sea Salt in my nasal wash since it has soothing properties for delicate membranes. I also use it to sweeten my tea, and in cooking and baking just like regular cane sugar without all the negative effects: Xylitol is very low on the Glycemic Index; it is a prebiotic meaning it is fermented in the gut creating short chain fatty acids (SCFA) which encourage the growth of good micro-organisms, vs sugar and other fructose sources which encourage the growth of harmful bacteria and yeasts; it is an anti-inflammatory, vs sugar which causes inflammation. There are so many reasons to use xylitol instead of sugar that I could go on and on but I feel this would be out of the scope of my review. My only reservation regarding xylitol in general is that it is still a highly processed food so, if for no other reason, it is probably best to limit the amount of consumption.<br /><br />I thought Zveet would be my new go-to xylitol and was prepared to place another order. To my surprise the price increased more than 20% in only one month (from $23.99 last month, to today's price of $28.99). There really is no good reason for a price jump of this magnitude so I deducted one star for unstable pricing. My usual supplier, Natrazyle Kosher Xylitol, has remained fairly consistent in terms of low prices. It is currently $24.97/5 lbs on Amazon. Of all the companies I contacted, Natrazyle appeared to be one of the few willing to post on their website that their corn is grown without the use of pesticides and is non-GMO, so it has been my primary source. Since price is a factor I will probably continue to order Natrazyle. If Zveet brings the cost down and it remains stable I will probably return as a customer, if only to support US manufacturing.

I've also tried it sprinkled on fruit, sweetening whipped cream, and in homemade hot chocolate. The only thing it seems to lack is the resulting sugar crash that consuming regular sugar used to cause me. And that's a good thing!

Fabulous!<br /><br />The only drawback is the price is so high. I won't be able to use this in large amounts due to the price, and also because it could cause stomach upset if too much at a time is consumed. Every day I allow one teaspoonful of this Xylitol to melt in my mouth for it's beneficial effects. I don't have any particular reason for this dosage. It just seems about right for me. So far I've had no negative effects.

review/text: This made in the USA birch derived xylitol is superb.  I love the fact its from an American business.  Xylitol has many benefits and finding it in bulk at a better price than most all suppliers was an added bonus.  Good for your daily diet, good for your teeth, and beneficial in other ways too!

review/summary: Love It, but would like nuts or sunflower seeds
review/text: We've been looking for some time for a reasonably priced trail mix to take on our hikes, especially hikes we take on vacation. While we like Costco's taste-wise, the pieces of dried fruit are too large as is the original bag. We needed a bag that each of us could carry on a 5-8 mile trek in mountains and foothills, and then I found Emerald Harmon's Farmer's Market Dried Fruit which is just sweet enough, but not too sweet. A 10 ounce bag is perfect although, having no willpower, I could probably polish a bag off just watching a baseball game. But watch out: as with most trail mixes, a quarter cup is 130 calories. On the other hand, we've got to be burning serious calories when hiking.<br /><br />We do prefer Harmony's Original Trail Mix which has nuts, M&M-like candy, and sunflower seeds. That cuts down on the sweetness, but I've just taken to adding sunflower seeds which I order separately.<br /><br />Note: Though this has not nuts in it, it is processed on equipment that also processes peanuts. Even though this has no peanuts in it, those of you with kids that have a peanut allergy should know that.<br /><br />P.S. Harmony is made by Diamond, and living near Diamond's headquarters in California, and buying their products for over 40 years, I know that their stuff will be fresh. I have nothing to do with Diamond, so consider this a personal endorsement.

Turns out this treat is not so healthy as implied. Im not sure if its maybe dried fruit just has alot of carbs, or the company on purposely fattened it up. But if you just look on the nutritional label you'll see. Its not as bad as a candy bar, or chips. But its not "healthy" either. Great product none the less. I think if I dont over indulge on these and drink mostly water, it will be better for me :)

It is probably 50% raisins, but that is fine as well. The craisins aren't whole, but are slices.<br /><br />All in all this is a good mix.

review/summary: Awesome Tea!
review/text: I have been drinking this rooibos for about a year now and I love it. The smell is purely amazing, reminds me of when my parents would open the coffee can in the morning and I'd butt in and say "Hey let me smell it!", I catch myself doing that with this tea. I use to work in the grocery business and really payed attention to prices. On average 1 can of this rooibos runs for about $12.00 at your local grocer, on Amazon its $16.99 for 2 cans... Do the math, this is a steal! I have ventured into other tea brands like shopping at overpriced Teavana and getting prettty darn good rooibos. Yet, I still find myself coming back to the rishi, can't beat the blueberry or the jamaica red bush. Also, I have never had a problem with it being to overwhelmingly tart. If it's too tart, brew less.

They do re-heat OK, but I bought another brand at the grocery store that I like better. Unfortunately it doesn't appear to be available on Amazon.

review/summary: Grandma's Preserves Were Good, But Not This Good...
review/text: Cherry preserves have always been a weakness of mine; Granny Walls would make them after Gramps and Dad picked the cherry trees clean.  I have wonderful memories and the taste of these delightful treats has stayed with me through the years.<br /><br />Sadly, Granny no longer makes preserves.  The commercial products available to replace her preserves left much to be desired; they were overcooked, much too gluey, too sweet, and had little natural cherry flavor.  Then I found Bonne Maman on Amazon's Best Deals space and decided to take a chance.  Eureka!<br /><br />These preserves have a fresh, clean cherry flavor without any hint of overcooking or artificial additives.  They are thick enough to stay on your toast or bagel, but not so gluey as to sit in a gelaninous blob.  There are plenty of whole cherries, not the chopped up pieces in inferior products, so that this is actually a true cherry preserve rather than jelly.  I definitely recommend these preserves to anyone who loves cherries; I'll be buying more when I run out even if they aren't on sale!  And, I'm going to try the other Bonne Maman products, too.

review/text: I love cherry preserves.  I usually buy them from Trader Joes or local orchards here in Oregon.  These are the best preserves I've ever had.  They're expensive but worth every dime.  The shipping was lightning fast too.

review/text: I love this jam. I buy it at my local store. However this time I decided to buy 6 of them from Amazon. Big mistake. Fedex delivered these 4 days late...apparently Amazon had the wrong address. When I finally received them, all of the jars were already open, spilling jam everywhere on the inside of the box. Fortunately I was able to save most of the jam...but now I've got old, perishable jam. I don't know how long it'll last. I would advise all to not buy anything like this from Amazon...ever.

review/summary: delicious whole ingredient snack, great pre-portioned packs
review/text: Was happy to find a delicious snack that didn't taste "healthy," was easy to grab and go, and didn't have any gross ingredients like splenda or weird chemicals.  I was thrilled to read the list: bananas, wheat flour, sugar, egg, canola oil, baking soda, salt, vanilla, baking powder.<br />Delicious and nothing for me to feel weird about in there.  Would love the added benefit of organic eggs, flour, and expeller-pressed canola but everything can't be perfect.  Very happy with my purchase.

review/text: If you ever visit Canada you cannot miss the Ubiquitous Tim Horton's franchises, it seems as if they are on every corner (and small wonder: everything they sell is excellent, reasonably priced, and served with typical Canadian efficiency and politeness.) The quality of Tim Horton's coffee is pretty remarkable -- it is very, very good -- and the price is not outrageous (I picked up a 39 ounce can in a Canadian Walmart for about $16.50 in American dollars toward the end of november, 2010, which was about the same price they were selling for in the Tim Horton's stores.) Note: Their decaf is every bit as good, but I haven't been able to find it in cans larger than 13 ounces.

review/summary: NEW TWIST ON A TRADITIONAL HOLIDAY DELIGHT
review/text: I have always loved stollens whether homemade by my aunts in Milwaukee or the imported German stollens. I must say these cranberry stollens are really tasty without being sicky sweet. They are chocked full of all the ingredients of traditional German stollens but the addition of cranberries really makes for a full flavored treat. Sometimes you will get a sour flavor from the addition of cranberries to breads but not in this fine German product. The flavor is excellent and the cranberries add an additional fruity flavor to this fine holiday bread. The bread is moist and not dried out like many other stollens. Very good and different for those who want to try a new twist to the traditional stollens.

review/summary: An Okay Product
review/text: I've had curry before, perhaps a different type of curry, because this is not what I remember curry to taste like. This particular curry was thick as I remember it, and perhaps it was different because it its dry beef curry and not the chicken curry I am use to.<br /><br />I found the taste to be very rich. It was alright. I didn't care for the pieces of leaves, whatever it was, that was in the soft. I thought after a while, they would soften up like scallions, or something along those lines, but they didn't. It was a bit of a pain having to stop and pick them out of my mouth.<br /><br />Made it for hubby and he seemed to like it. However, he agrees that we won't be in a hurry to run out and buy the product. I imagine you'd have to be an avid Curry fan to be excited for this product. For me, it was just okay.

review/summary: Delicious, quick and simple curry mix. I'm going to buy more.
review/text: I love curry and frequently cook Thai / Indian style meals and love those kinds of restaurants as well. Rendang curry is a sweeter (coconut milk) southeast Asian-style curry that I've never tried before, so this kit looked like an easy way to try it.<br /><br />Bottom line -- preparing a meal with this kit is EASY and the results are DELICIOUS.<br /><br />The kit comes with two packets -- curry spice mix paste and powdered coconut milk. All you have to do is...<br /><br />a) cut up some chunks of your preferred meat (I used roughly 2 pounds of ribeye steak) and brown it in a pan with a little oil,<br /><br />b) heat some water and mix in the coconut powder and curry paste,<br /><br />c) put the browned meat from the pan into the pot with the curry sauce mix.<br /><br />The results are amazing -- extremely flavorful, and not too spicy for the novice curry lover (I prefer a little more spice in mine so I added some pepper flakes and powdered cayenne). All you need to go along with this is some white rice, or noodles, or vegetables... really, whatever you prefer. I used white rice with mine.<br /><br />The one tip I have is to add the coconut powder first, and do it slowly, whisking it in the whole time. If you dump it in too fast, it can clump up and require more mixing than it would if you add it slowly.<br /><br />All in all, this mix is a relatively cheap, easy, and quick way to whip up a delicious Asian-style curry (the description says it's a Singapore-style curry). I'm going to be getting more of this, and other flavor mixes as well!

review/summary: Would I buy it again?
review/text: I probably would not buy this if I had the chance to. It was an odd, odd, flavor. I really didn't have any steak or meat to add to it so I just made the sauce and ladled it over rice.  It wasn't half bad but rather sweet for a meal for me.<br /><br />I do have some issues with this product.  The first thing is that is is made in Singapore.  Why are we importing food products from another country and does our country check to see if it meets our standards?  Secondly, some of the measurements are not in our form as in 4/5 cup of water. What is 4/5th's???  I know, a little less than a cup, I think. But, since I don't have a 1/5th cup, it was a problem.<br /><br />The serving size is 2 tablespoons.  How can I have a meal with two tablespoons of liquid and meat? Its a mini size.<br /><br />All in all the stuff wasn't that bad but I wouldn't want it again.

review/summary: Easy and Tasty, but not healthy
review/text: The Rendang Curry from Prima Taste is an easy to make and tasty dish.  Unfortunately, it is not the healthiest.  But I don't mind eating a little fat sometimes, and we did enjoy the taste.  Additionally, it was easy to make witch makes it very convenient.<br /><br />We added beef as the directions say, but also some onion, bell peppers, and garlic.  The addition of the vegetables not only adds some nutrition, but also adds to taste and makes the product go farther.  We ate it over rice.  Please note, as I stated above, the paste is primarily fat with some sugar and spices.  It is not healthy at all.  The meat, added vegetables and rice provide more nutrition and allow you to eat less of the paste/sauce, thus reducing the percentage of fat calories compared to the total calories consumed.  (80 of the 110 calories per two tablespoons come from fat)<br /><br />The price is a bit high, considering you have to add other things to it, but it is not outrageous.  I just think those that are budget minded may choose alternate curry pastes that are less expensive.<br /><br />Over all, I give it four stars because we really did like the taste and it was very easy to make.  I took one star off because it is not very healthy and the price is a bit high.  For an Asian (Singapore) treat once in a while when you also want a quick dinner, it is a tasty meal.

review/text: This is my first experience with this particular brand of curry. My wife is the usual cook in the household, but she sprained her ankle pretty badly so I was given dinner duties last night. Turned out to be the perfect time to try this out.<br />I have to say it is extremely flavorful and bursting with curry goodness. I was impressed, as was my wife. The kids even ate it, and they aren't huge fans of curry. The only reason I can't give this 5 stars is because I can find similar very good curry at my local supermarket and save a few bucks in the process. It's certainly better or as good as most, but not so much better that I can justify the extra cost. When you have a family of four to feed on a limited budget, this is a luxury item. Good as a treat every now and then, but not as a regular purchase.

review/summary: Makes a Great Meal
review/text: I'd never had beef rendang, but I've love most curries so I gave it a shot.  The instructions on the package say to buy 28oz of filet mignon.  However, a little web searching revealed that beef rendang normally uses slow-cooked cheaper cuts of meat and the Prima Taste website has instructions for how to prepare the curry that way - basically just use half of the sauce and seasoning initially and add the rest near the end, plus use more water.<br /><br />Anyway the end result - using chopped up beef round, and pouring the curry on top of bhutanese red rice - was spectacular.<br /><br />So why 4 stars instead of 5?  I couldn't find any good options - even on the Prima Taste website - for adding veggies.  The meal is the beef equivalent of a death by chocolate dessert.<br /><br />But if you're looking for a delicious and different curry, this stuff gets it done.

review/text: My wife and I tried this the other night.  She made stir-fried veggies and meat.  I took care of preparing the sauce.<br /><br />Oh, you need to look carefully on the back of the box for an important part of the directions.  In VERY small print it says to add 4/5 cup of water to a pan, then add the contents of both enclosed pouches (curry and cocoanut milk) and heat to a boil.<br /><br />Anyway, once the sauce was ready we added the meat and veggies to the it and let it all simmer for a while.  When we just couldn't wait any longer we scooped the sauce/veggies/meat onto rice and enjoyed.<br /><br />One box makes enough easily for 4 generous helpings.<br /><br />I knew it was a hit as soon as my wife was asking, "Where can we get more of this?"  My response?  "Amazon."  :-)<br /><br />I also knew it had scored major points when my wife was texting her sister with her latest yummy discovery.<br /><br />All in all, the ease of preparation is quite easy.  The result is great.  We will be buying more!  (We have to, I finished the last of it today in my lunch at work.)<br /><br />As for spiciness...it's not too spicy.  I don't enjoy or do "spicy" very well...taste and otherwise.  But this went down well and I enjoyed every bite.<br /><br />5 stars all the way.

review/summary: A tasty dish for curry lovers, but on the pricey side.
review/text: The Prima Taste Rendang Curry sauce kit makes a more than serviceable Rendang Curry, containing everything you'll need sans the beef, but at this price point, you might be left scratching your head as to why it's so expensive. It makes a delicious and easy-to-prepare (brown the beef, then mix, heat and eat, basically) Indonesian curry. You'll be waiting for your rice cooker to finish well before your Rendang curry is ready to put over it. It's a rather mild, sweet curry, so if that's not your cup of tea, then steer clear, but it was a nice change from the mostly Indian curries that I generally have and while I did end up using a healthy dose of Sriracha with it, the flavor was good without it (I'm just generally used to something more spicy and that's what I had my heart set on).<br /><br />There are only a couple of negatives with this one. The finished product is a bit on the oily side and there are leaves throughout the mixture (I see some are referring to these as the Keffir lime leaves, but they seemed more like lemongrass to me, hard and husk-like) that are probably meant to be removed from the end product. I ate a few, just to see what they were, and it wasn't altogether pleasant. You'll want to watch for those.<br /><br />Aside from that, the only real downside to the Prima Taste Rendang Curry Sauce Kit is the price. At nearly $7 a kit, it's a bit expensive for what you're getting, although I'm sure that if you bought all of the necessary ingredients separately (if you can get them locally), it would cost more (albeit with some leftover ingredients) and take a whole lot more time and effort. From a convenience point of view, if you love Rendang Curry, it's probably more than worth that price. If on the other hand, you've never had it and are just looking to try something new, paying for a 4-pack might be a bit more investment than you're willing to make.

review/summary: Yummy and Easy to Make
review/text: Prima Taste Rendang Curry is mighty tasty. I'm no expert on Singaporean food, but I have traveled and lived in Asia so like various types of curry. The box contains powdered coconut milk and the curry paste in separate bags. Additionally, the recipe calls for 28 oz. of beef, 2.5 t. vegetable oil, and 4/5 c water. Serve with rice or mashed potatoes. The package says there is no added MSG, artificial coloring, or added preservatives. The package also says it contains the following common allergens: soybeans, wheat, tree nuts, and milk products. It is a product of Singapore. I didn't have enough beef thawed so I also used some chicken. It is easy to prepare.<br /><br />Both my husband and I liked it.  I don't mind the bits of leaf in it. Sadly, it is quite high in fat and contains a bit of sugar. Serving size is only 2 tablespoons of the mix and that has 9 grams of fat and 5 grams of carbs. I realistic serving is probably 3 times that plus the meat and rice or whatever you serve it with. I may buy this as a treat, but I can't have it all the time. Maybe, it would be ok if I broke it down to very small servings...which is what I did with the leftovers.

review/summary: Taste is okay, but half of it is pure fat and sugar
review/text: Preparation is easy. Just dump the contents of the two bags in the box into a pan with some water, mix it really, really good, and bring it to a boil. Doesn't get any easier than that.<br />The taste is okay, with a little zing to it, but the coconut is a bit too dominant for me. Balancing this a bit more on the spicy side would be more to my liking.<br /><br />So, that's all for the positive aspects. Now on to the negatives.<br />One word: Fat.<br />Actually, there is another word: Calories. Lots of them. Galore. Through the roof.<br />One serving of this sauce is two table spoons, ca. 22 g. That is not much. Chances are, that you will eat way more than that during a normal meal.<br />Well, do it at your own peril, because those two spoons you are eating have 110 calories, 80 of those come from fat. Of the 22g on your two spoons, 9 g are pure fat, 7 of those are of the saturated kind. These two spoons will supply 14 percent of your daily fat intake (with a 2000 calories diet). 3 grams of sugar are also included in those two spoons.<br />I wonder how those people in Singapore can stay that skinny with such a hearty diet?!<br />On the other side, there are no vitamins, iron, calcium or other of those pesky healthy ingredients in the sauce. Makes me wonder how that can be, if they really used all those natural things they mention in the ingredients list. well, I guess most of those onions, chilies, leafs, garlic, and so on, are just in there in miniscule parts. Most of the contents in this sauce must be the vegetable oil (but those too usually have at least some vitamins in it, don't they?), sugars, and so on.<br />So, it basically is a fatty, sugary, unhealthy, vaguely spicy and almost too sweet concoction.<br />And don't even get me started on the price - are you kidding me? I can feed my whole family for that amount at one of our local Thai/Chinese/East Asian places ...

review/text: Oh this dish was so very surprisingly delicious!  Instead of beef, I used three packages of Gardein Beef Tips -- the best-tasting vegetarian food ever.  Inside the box you get two packages, one of the redang paste and the other is coconut milk powder.  The directions could not be easier: brown the meat, mix packages together with water, boil, add  the meat.  As a Caribbean woman, I must have flavor in my food, something that I only find in Caribbean and southeast Asian cooking.  The flavors were very bold, not spicy at all and a bit on the sweet side.  There was a lot of gravy even though I tried to boil it down for almost 15 minutes, but that's quite alright.  I really hope that this is sold near me but even if it's not, I'll definitely be ordering this from Amazon.  Highly recommended!

I added fresh vegetables and beef and prepared it according to the directions.<br /><br />I liked the flavor but it was a little sweet and not spicy enough compared to what I get in NYC.<br /><br />If I make this again, I'm adding some chilies.  I served mine over jasmine rice.

review/summary: Better than I expected, makes a ton of food
review/text: Wow.. Testing this out for dinner right now.<br /><br />Better than I expected.<br /><br />Tasty curry (reminds me of panang thai curry), just add water!  Was worried about all the fatty coconut oil (7 g saturated fat), but now realize that each one of these makes a *ton* of curry.  And a little goes a long way, flavor-wise.  Box is rated for 15 servings and I believe that is realistic.<br /><br />Serving suggestion: with beef or tofu, over rice.  side with veggies (great with Broccoli and Asparagus).<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Flavor.  Spicy but not hot. Delicious.  I personally add liberal Sriracha sauce.<br />- Value.  Makes quite a bit, easily.<br />- Packs light. This would be a fantastic camping / backpacking treat for a large group.<br />- Shelf life.  Lasts long for a quick meal backup plan.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- A little rich on the coconut side, but a little goes a long way.  Plan on leftovers.<br /><br />Overall exceeded expectations.  Highly reccommended.

review/summary: Restaurant Quality
review/text: Have been to an authentic Tai restaurant a few days before trying this sauce kit, I was surprised to find that it tastes exactly like what I had ordered at the restaurant. Both were delicious, but Prima Taste cost me a lot less money. I didn't expect a boxed sauce kit to taste this good, but it does. It's easy to make, too. The kit includes the coconut portion of the mix (no need to buy coconut milk like other products). It's mildly hot/spicy, but newbie's should be able to handle it (I don't like overly spicey dishes, myself. I always get mild taco sauce).<br /><br />One downside, I can't find this product in my local supermarket! The Prima Taste website does sell online, however.<br /><br />Hopefully, they will start stocking this item in the near me.

review/summary: Tasty but not healthy
review/text: I'm a long time fan of Patak's curry sauces and had never used a kit before. Adding the wet ingredients at home definitely makes for a fresher tasting curry. I really liked the flavor and the sauce couldn't have been easier to make. The only downside is that this curry sauce, like most of them, is very sodium-heavy. A single serving is more or less a day's sodium. But given that curry isn't really a health food at the best of times, this is a worthwhile once-in-a-while splurge and is guaranteed to make the most stove-phobic person feel like a great cook!

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: I don't cook much and rarely make a meat dish, but I decided it would be fun to try this.  It is very easy to make and it is delicious.  My husband who always says he doesn't like Thai food really enjoyed this dish.  He was very impressed so I didn't tell him how easy it was to make.<br /><br />You just cook your meat (I used round steak) until it is tender, then add the ingredients and there it is an impressive curry dish.  I thought it tasted as good as our local Thai restaurant.  It is not  hot and spicy so if you want it to be spicier you should add some pepper of some kind.<br /><br />Over all I love this product and would buy it again.

review/summary: Yum.
review/text: I am not particularly familiar with Singaporean food, but I do love curry in all of its iterations (Thai, Indian, etc.), so I was excited to get this.  This curry is a mix of a spice blend and a coconut base, which makes for a tasty sauce.  The box recommends beef, so that is what I used.  Following instructions I pan-fried the beef, then added the spices and coconut mix.  The box suggests using a different pan to make the sauce, but I just dumped it in with the beef and it still turned out well.  The result was a flavorful, slightly spicy curry, which went well over jasmine rice.  The box also suggests mashed potatoes, but I think I far prefer it on rice.  This is a great dinner for a rushed night- simple, fast, and tasty.

review/summary: Curry in a jiffy
review/text: For a long time I've wanted to make a curry.  But, I never took the time.  This kit includes everything you need except the beef.  You could use chicken or any other meat you wish.  The curry was very tasty with just the right amount of spice.  It was a little spicy but not too hot for your average American family to eat.  This is a great starter kit to have around for those nights where you want something a little more substantial than throwing spaghetti on but don't want to take the time to go through a lot of prep work.  Just mix the coconut powder with the included sauce, brown your beef, throw it in the sauce and in a few minutes you have a curry.  In fact it took longer to cook the brown rice we had with this than to make the curry.

review/summary: Good taste
review/text: I followed the directions of this package, except I add a lot of sliced carrots in it w/ 2 lbs of really good beef sliced the recommended width. While the taste was really good, the meat was too tough for me to eat because of the width of the cut. If I had to do it again, I would not use beef and use it w/ chicken instead because the coconut wasn't able to soften the meat enough.<br /><br />Originally, I was expecting the final outcome to be a bit drier and more like a stir fry like the picture on the package, however it does leave a good amount of sauce that gives you the option of adding more ingredients like vegatables into the mix.<br /><br />For something that requires not much prep work, it's an excellent method of cooking if you don't want the hassle of finding all the spices and ingredients involved in making a curry. This is exactly the type of product I would take w/ me on a trip like camping or somewhere I wouldn't have my regular pantry available. It's absolutely simple to use and cook. It's also not very spicey, so it if you perfer more spice I'd recommend adding that.<br /><br />As a quick option to cooking, I'd highly recommend this production.

review/summary: Not really a curry, but interesting
review/text: This is a mix to make a spiced beef dish. If you are expecting a curry (meat and veg in a spicy sauce) this is not what Rendang consists of. Instead, this is a meat dish, on the dry side, that uses beef tenderloin and spices and coconut milk to make a main dish. The package calls for beef tenderloin, but theoretically, you can use iver, duck, chicken, lamb, goat or any other meat.  This type of dish is a sort of meat preservation; after caramelizing and coating the meat with spices, it can last at room temperature for some time.<br /><br />This is an Indonesian dish originating from Sumatra and is flavored with coconut milk and a mixture of including ginger, galangal, turmeric, lemon grass, garlic, shallot, chili. It's very nice with plain boiled rice.

review/summary: Was so good that it blew my mind!
review/text: This is the perfect blend of spice and sweet.  It transformed my steak and mushrooms into something magical.<br /><br />This is so easy to fix.  Just brown the meat and veggies (mushrooms in my case).  Remove from pan and mix coconut  powder with sauce and 4/5 cup water (I used a 1-cup and filled it to about 1/4-inch below the rim).  Another reviewer mentioned that the coconut powder is difficult to mix in.  Using a whisk solved this issue, and I was able to whisk everything together in a matter of seconds.  After everything is mixed together, add the meat and veggies back into the pan, and bring to a boil.  Another reviewer mentioned the tough vegetable pieces (leaves).  I noticed that too, but cooking it a couple minutes longer solved that issue.<br /><br />I think that this might just be the easiest, tastiest dish I've ever had.  I'm anxious to try the other varieties of Prima Taste kits.

review/summary: A difficult dish for us.
review/text: This dish proved difficult for us, although it was simple to prepare.  The Papa Bear found it too spicy, the Baby Bear didn't like the look of it and refused to try it, and the Mama Bear (that's me) found it sweeter than the curry I usually eat. A quick read of the package says that this is in the Singaporean style, which we have never tried. That may be what made it difficult for us. I'm giving it an extra star because it is probably good when served to people familiar with Singaporean food.<br /><br />Preparing the dish was a snap, just adding the sauces in the package to sauteed beef, bell peppers and onions. However, because the sauces rendered the rest of the food inedible by most of the family, I wish I had just left the meat, peppers and onions plain, and served it to my family that way. I suggest tasting the sauces before adding to the meat, thus preventing an expensive dinner mistake.
