review/text: Enough of these misinformation.<br /><br />The FDA has investigated this product since 2007 and have not found any problems with the product.  FDA recently issued updated report dated 3/9/2012.<br /><br />Google:<br />"Questions and Answers Regarding Chicken Jerky Treats from China" by March 9, 2012 issued by FDA<br /><br />"<br />What is FDA testing for?<br />Since 2007, FDA has been actively investigating the cause of illness in pets reported in association with the consumption of chicken jerky products. Samples have been tested by FDA laboratories, by the Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (Vet-LRN), and by other animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S for multiple chemical and microbiological contaminants.<br />Product samples were tested for Salmonella, metals, furans, pesticides, antibiotics, mycotoxins, rodenticides, nephrotoxins (such as aristolochic acid, maleic acid, paraquat, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, toxic hydrocarbons, melamine and related triazines) and were screened for other chemicals and poisonous compounds. DNA verification was conducted on these samples to confirm the presence of poultry in the treats. Samples have also been submitted for nutritional composition (which includes glycerol concentrations), vitamin D excess and enterotoxin analysis. Some samples from recent cases (2011-2012) have been submitted for multiple tests and we are awaiting results. More samples are in the process of being collected for testing.<br /><br />What are the results of testing?<br />Samples collected from all over the United States have been tested for a wide variety of substances and to date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses.<br /><br />Has there been any indication that metal contamination in chicken jerky products may be the cause of illness in dogs?"<br />FDA's previous testing of chicken jerky product samples did not show toxic levels of metals. In addition, results from March 2012 toxic metal analyses, which included tests for heavy metals, have again shown samples of chicken jerky products to be negative for toxic metals.<br />"<br /><br />Amazon,  please continue sale of this product.  I have been a loyal buyer for the past 4 years and this has consistently been her favourite treat, second only to home-made Chicken Jerky fresh from the oven.

review/summary: Your dog will love these!
review/text: My dog got hooked on these pretty young, and now they're the only "treat" he'll eat. My mom had been giving them to her dog, and when he stayed over there he got a taste of them and went crazy. They seem to be relatively healthy, and we can make them last a long time. My dog is a wanderer, and the best way we've found to keep him close, is to give him a piece of one of these when we whistle and he comes home. Since we've gotten him trained, he always comes back to a whistle. He's a small dog so we usually only give him about 1/3 of one of these, and one bag will last us a month. If you do the subscription plan with Amazon, the price ends up being very reasonable.

review/text: I adopted a 6 year old female Yorkie a year ago. She had been rescued from a puppy mill in Missouri where she had multiple litters of puppies and was caged in a small kennel. She looked pitiful when I got her. She had never had a treat of any kind, but soon understood what it was. These Dogswell Vitality treats with Flaxseed and Vitamins have contributed to transforming her (Brees) coat and skin. She looks beautiful now. I like that this treat has no added hormones, no fillers and no byproducts.  The only downside is that it is made in China.

review/summary: Proceed With Caution
review/text: My beloved black Lab recently experienced liver failure. The vet said he was 24 hours away from death.  At the time he was eating the Dogswell Vitality Chicken<br />strips as a treats.  Though it would be impossible to say that these treats caused the problem, I would proceed with caution.  If it does not say that the product ingredients come from the USA and that the product is also made in the USA, I no longer buy it.  I will pay more for a product made here rather than risk this happening again.  In all fairness, I cannot be 100% sure this product caused the problem.  All other food my dog gets is organic meats and vegetables that we eat as well. And we have had no liver problems. I will gladly pay more money for USA products that support USA jobs. Which is why I switched to the Colorado brand treats.

review/summary: Inconsistent moisture content
review/text: We've been giving this treat to our little Yorkie for over two years and she absolutely loves them. However this is the second time we've had to arrange for a replacement shipment because the manufacturer isn't able to provide consistent quality. When ideal, the treats are moist and chewy, like jerky, but the treats in this last shipment were as hard as bricks...essentially devoid of any moisture. Our little dog knows what to do with them but it breaks our hearts watching her try to eat them.<br />I talked with the manufacturer the first time there was a problem. They were very apologetic and explained they were correcting the issue. Guess their old nemesis has returned. Amazon is also very nice about it and is replacing the most recent shipment at no additional charge. We'll have to see whether our dog can enjoy the replacement.

review/text: This product is made in China. Although it is distributed by a company in the US, it states "Made In China." I see that nowhere listed on the ad to buy it and thinking I was doing my dog a favor, I did him harm; he has been ill for two days, after eating two of these "treats" when I received them two days ago. Because the label touts health and wholeness does not mean it is made by people with health in mind. It is made in China. The same nation which put melamine in food; melamine reads as protein in analysis of the food so it was a cheap and shameless method to advertise more protein while it caused misery and tears and death to countless. And this is an item Amazon does not accept as a return so purchase at your own (dog's) risk.

review/text: I just purchased a bag of this Vitality Chicken Breast dog jerky product from a large national retailer today (I liked the natural, wholesome ingredients), and was VERY concerned and upset when I read that is is made in China. Given the many unecessary and unethical pet deaths that occured fairly recently due to melamine and other toxic ingredients in Chinese made pet products, my concern is quite legitimate and justifiable. You just don't know if you can trust any pet products from China anymore. And here I thought that I finally found a good, heatlhy, wholesome pet treat for my dog. I had to throw out the bag. Bummer.

review/text: This rice is delightfully nutty; very, very flavorful and has a lovely buttery texture. I fell in love with Lundberg's short grain brown rice a couple of years ago when I tried it at a friend's. I really hope that Lundberg Farm will never -ever- stop growing this wonderful rice.<br /><br />This 12 lb bag is no longer available at the warehouse so many thanks to Amazon for making it available here.<br /><br />TIP: For the plumpest texture, soak the rice in room temperature water for at least three hours before cooking (if you happen to have a pressure cooker, cook for 12 minutes - rice to water ratio: 2 to 1).

The search ended here with the connection to the Lundberg Farms website, where the "exact" product was easy to find & purchase, including the large size, 12# bag. A cause for concern, this purchase was made as the lead level in rice products scare was being publicized. The Lundberg Farms site addressed the issue with all pertinent information concerning their products so consumers could make intelligent, informed choices as to what to buy & use. Thank you Lundberg Farms and Amazon!

One thing that you should know about this flavor is that not everyone likes it.  Several of my family members don't like it much at all.  However, I think the flavor is amazing, and quake at the thought that they might discontinue it some day.  What would I do?  There's nothing even similar.  This gum freshens your breath, but it isn't as harsh as some of the other Eclipse minty flavors.  It's mildly spicy, but not quite as strong as most cinnamon gums, I would say.  It does have a pleasant sweet spicy flavor that lasts and lasts.  In fact, one odd (but in my mind, wonderful) thing about this flavor is that it actually gets stronger as you chew it longer!  I don't know how they did that.  It contains cardamom (a spice used in gingerbread and also in Indian curries).<br /><br />Please try it!  I'm desperate for you to try it and like it.  We've got to get more people buying this gum so that the flavor is never discontinued.

review/summary: Really Good Chewing Gum - Highly Recommended!
review/text: Eclipse Breeze Exotic Mint chewing gum is, by far, the best breath freshening sugar free gum I have tried. Unlike other gums where you need multiple pieces to get any noticeable effects, one piece of this gum is enough to leave your mouth feeling cool and clean. The cardamom flavor is fairly strong, so that might make a difference to how much you like this gum (my parents used cardamom a lot, so I like the taste).<br /><br />My only minor complaint is that the gum becomes somewhat "stringy" after chewing it for a long time, and since the flavor really does last a long time, it almost always happens.<br /><br />This is a really good, long lasting gum!<br /><br />Highly Recommended<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Not A Good Flavor, But Good Against Bad Breath
review/text: "Eclipse Breeze Exotic Berry" gum is surprisingly unpleasant tasting as the cardamom and berry flavors do not go together! I bought this flavor after trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q9ZX8C">Eclipse breeze exotic mint sugar free chewing gum - 12/pack, 12 ea</a> (which is very good "*****") and was very disappointed. Just to be sure that it wasn't only me, my kids tried it as well and they both found it to be "gross".<br /><br />The only real upside of this sugarfree gum is that after the berry flavor goes away, the cardamom does do a good job freshening your breath.<br /><br />Not Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Best.Gum.Ever
review/text: I have a serious addiction to this gum but cannot find it anywhere except online. I go through at least a pack a day. I used to chew Peppermint or Spearmint or Winterfrost but I can't chew anything but Exotic Mint any more. The flavor is just right and it lasts forever.<br /><br />Seriously, if you see this gum in a store, buy all of it. It's like little candy gold bullion. I have opted to pay twice as much online for this gum versus gum I can buy on the store shelves just so I can get this particular flavor. Who would do that if the gum weren't the best gum ever? Nobody. That's who.<br /><br />I also wrote Wrigley to see if they'll send me a year-supply for free. Cross your fingers and wish me luck.

review/text: The Exotic Mint flavor is a really nice change of pace. It is very mellow, yet freshening - not the super sharp, almost burning minty burst that quickly fades, that you'll find with most gums. The cardamom works very well with the mild mint flavor, but "berry cardamom" sounds like a terrible idea. No thank you!

review/summary: expensive, but tastes good
review/text: My local Asian grocery store sells this same brand of "organic" udon noodles for about the same price as Amazon (except that they only make you buy one pack at a time).  They also sell non-organic udon noodles that look and taste about the same for less than half the price.  Is the "organic" worth the extra money?  You have to decide for yourself.<br /><br />Udon is a great general purpose noodle.  For a quick cheap tasty bowl of noodle soup, just boil some udon noodles and add some miso soup paste and vegetables.  One 3 ounce bundle of dry noodles conveniently makes a nice serving of cooked noodles.  A bowl of soup like this takes about the same amount of time to cook as instant ramen, but since the udon noodles are not full of salt and oil, they are a lot healthier for you.  Yes, udon does cost a little more than instant ramen, but you can save money by going with the non-organic noodles, and they are still much healthier than instant ramen.<br /><br />You can also stir-fry the noodles or make them into a salad.  For a full meal, top the noodles with a serving of meat and sauce.

review/summary: The simple pleasure of chocolate combined with peanut butter
review/text: It was in the 1920s that the H.B. Reese Candy Company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and Hershey's milk chocolate. Back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Harry Burnett Reese was actually a former dairy employee of Milton S. Hershey, the founder of the Hershey Foods Corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. Reese made a lot of other products, such as Johnny Bars (caramel-like molasses) and Lizzie Bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.<br /><br />In the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of Hershey, Reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. In the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. During World War II Reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. After World War II the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. In 1963 the H.B. Reese Candy Company, Inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the Hershey Chocolate Company, and in 1976 the first variation in the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup was made with the introduction of Reese's Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />In 1992 Reese's started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered Reese's bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched ReeseSticks to go along with the Fastbreak, Nutrageous, and Bites, not to mention peanut butter Christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. Now even have White Chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. But behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. There is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the "you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate" ad campaign that inspired many Americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.<br /><br />Now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. You just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. But it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. Or you can buy this 6 pack of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them without resorting to making them.

review/text: Absolutely delicious tea, especially if you are fond of green teas. The tea tastes very fresh and has a wonderful jasmine flavor. It can get very strong if brewed too long, however. I recommend one teaspoon in an infuser steeped for 3-5 minutes. Great quality for the money - should last me quite awhile!

review/summary: Great value for huge bag of gummi worms!
review/text: This was a great find!  I have five kids and they love the Trolli brand sour gummy worms. I could spend a fortune purchasing individual bags from retailers, which is why I was thrilled to find this huge bage at a great valued price. In fact, it's a great idea for concession stands as fundraisers (separate the bag for individual resale). The gummy worms were fresh and delicious and were shipped quickly. I highly recommend and will be buying more!

review/summary: My favorite candy in bulk
review/text: I probably should find out if Bayside Candy will set up a standing order for regular deliveries of this wonderful candy.  The 5 lb. bag has a little moisture-capturing device so the sugar crystals don't turn to goo.  I keep some in my desk at work and love to hold out the container and say, "Would you like a worm?"  Nobody turns them down, not even the people who are sour enough already.  Again, this is a product that I once found in a store, but then it vanished and Amazon was the only place where I could find it.  Amazon's selection qualifiers helped me make sure I was ordering what I wanted.  This is another strong case for my belief that if you don't know where to go for something, go to Amazon.

We are a BRAND NEW competition BBQ team and placed FIRST in pork and 6th overall in our very first KCBS competition 2 weeks ago. Here is the cool part. I used Harry Soo's pork recipe that he posted on his Face book page. It is amazing! Harry is my BBQ hero and thanks to this rub and recipe, I was able to beat Harry Soo himself (just in pork;)). When I approached him after wards and introduced myself he was so genuinely excited for us and very gracious, its then that I told him thank you for giving us that recipe because that is what I used to win. Of course he walked away the Grand Champion, and deservedly so. Do yourself a favor whether you compete or not and grab this stuff. It works!

review/text: These choco peanut butter bars are delicious and perfectly filling.  I got these to eat for breakfast and as an occasional snack.  I don't know about the other flavors yet but this one is really tasty and a great texture.  It has some chocolate chips in it but not too many.  It has just enough to satisfy that chocolate craving or sweet tooth.  Now that I've tried these and love them, I definitely plan on trying the other flavors although I can't imagine any of them being as good as this one.  If you like peanut butter or peanut butter items with some chocolate, you should try this.  I love them.<br /><br />Update: I just got the Almond Trail Mix ones and while they are good, these choco peanut butter ones are so much better.

review/summary: Hearty and Satisfying
review/text: What a wonderful listing of ingredients! The chocolate pieces in this bar help satisfy my sweet-tooth, and the hearty whole grain ingredients give this bar more heft in your stomach to help satiate your hunger longer.<br /><br />It's nice to have a bar that I can share with my vegan friends as well. However, it is not gluten-free due to the fact that it is packed on the same machines that pack gluten products, and it contains oats which some gluten-free individuals cannot handle (via the Earnest Eats FAQ [...]).<br /><br />I rated this bar 4 stars instead of 5 because it can be a bit tough to chew on at times. I have this bar under Amazon Subscribe & Save and some shipments are softer than others, so it may be an issue of how old the package is. Even with the toughest shipment I have received, it still has a nice chewy texture, so it's a delicious afternoon snack that you can eat in good conscience. When you're eating whole ingredients, it's going to chew a little bit more than our typical over-processed bars on the market - and that's a good thing!  Yum!

review/text: I really was scared to try this granola bar, I am always scared when trying new things.  I hate being disappointed by health foods but this did not disappoint but actually made my day 10X better. So amazing, the texture was perfect, flavor was there, and for being a dense bar it didn't wiegh me down like some granola bars do. The peanut butter flavor was amazing, not too strong but packs a nice peanut punch.  There were many chocolate chips that just melted in your mouth with each bite.  It was truly an orgasmic experience I hope to repeat in the future.  I have not tried the other ones but I hope to very soon after having such a positive experience with this bar. It was very sweet but the peanut butter and oats helped to calm it down. I love sweets so I had no problem with this, but some people who dont want something sweet may not like this. All the nutrition info can be found on their website but I did post some stuff. I am so happy to find a vegan granola bar that is not sweeted with nasty honey.  I am also very happy that I found these bars and plan to purchase more at my local health store while they are on sale.<br /><br />230 calories a bar<br />10 grams of fat<br />6 grams of protien<br />4 grams of fiber<br />14 grams of sugar<br />190 mg of sodium

review/text: Considering the price this is a good value purchase.  Although not as high a quality as the major brick & mortar competitor Mauna Loa, the nuts are of a good size and, to me, are salted just right.  About 20% of the nuts are of a darker color and have a slightly off taste, but not so bad that I'd pitch them.  I'd guess that about 50% of the nuts are halves, the rest whole nuts.  As I say, for the money it's a good buy.  If you are looking for more intact nuts, and more consistency in flavor then you'll have to spend the extra money for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00509LVIQ">Mauna Loa Macadamias, Dry Roasted with Sea Salt, 11-Ounce Packages</a>.

review/text: I happened upon this idea while at a local bookstore. I was having problems with my labs coming in from outside stinking and drooling and everything else that goes with the disgusting behavior of what is known as coprophagia-Poo-eating. So, I started by buying the real small little bottles of tenderizer, wetting the food down, and then pouring on 1-2 tsp of tenderizer over the top. The problem immediately seemed to settle down (although it does pick up in the winter for the poop-sicles). Anyway, this is definately the way to go to save a few dollars and not have to keep running to the store, buying them out of tenderizer. And, it does not contain MSG which is of added benefit. Who knows what that does to a doggie's tummy?
