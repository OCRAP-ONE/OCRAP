review/summary: Packs fall apart ;{  BIG DISAPOINTMENT :{
review/text: I thought I would try this other coffee pod. I usually buy Senseo Hazelnut. I was very disapointed in these pods. When I opened the package many of the pods had fallen apart. I had bought 3 packages and all of them were messy and coffee falling out of pods. Waiting for Senseo Haselhut to come back. I will by them instead. The old saying. You get what you pay for !!

review/summary: Delicious, flavorful
review/text: Received this order today and used a pepper and garlic clove in my pasta sauce to add a new flavor. The peppers are well roasted, seeded and skinned, with a few garlic cloves in olive oil.  Looks like whole peppers since the one I pulled out of the jar was whole, it looks like the others in the jar are whole, also. This is Made In PERU.  If you want to add a nice flavor and surprise, add a little of this to your tuna, salmon, potato or macaroni salads.  It added another dimension to my pasta sauce along with 'Polar anchovies' and 'Chicken of the Sea chopped clams', it didn't taste fishy at all, just gave it an upscale nuance.  A bit pricey but I can get about 3 uses from this size jar.  Will purchase again.

review/summary: Simply the best
review/text: These jars of roasted red peppers are absolutely the best brand I've ever tried, and I've had at least 5 different brands over the years.  The peppers are firm, not mushy like so many other brands, the inside of each pepper is amazingly clean and there are very few charred spots on the outside.<br /><br />There is just enough olive oil to make these peppers perfect for salads as well as in cooked dishes and the garlic definitely does not overwhelm the flavor. We use roasted red peppers in place of tomatoes in tuna salad, veggie salads, soups, stews, chili, etc. and these peppers add not only color but extra flavor and texture that are lacking in other brands.......plus being in glass rather than in cans means you do not have to worry about the BPA that is in most can liners.<br /><br />I had a case of these DeLallo peppers with garlic and oil a couple years ago and was delighted to find them on Amazon again.  They cost more than a lot of other brands but are worth every penny.  I can't remember the country of origin of the last case, but these are from Peru and according to the web site whatsonmyfood.org, imported vegetables (and fruit) have MUCH lower pesticide residues on them than the same products from the USA, which is good news if you care about eating healthy food.<br /><br />The packaging was superb, with an extra heavy box stuffed with foam peanuts, and the product arrived in perfect condition.  This is Amazon at its best!

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: The sticky rice is perfect, just microwave it in the container it comes in for 2 min.  The paper thin wraps are very small and it is a bit difficult to roll.  The result is a bit of a mess but tastes great.  I put a small amount of crab meat next to the rice.  Each pack comes with 10 wraps, a container of rice, and one soy sauce pack.  The calorie count is 340.  But with 1/2 it is a reasonable 170 and is enough for a lunch.  I bought it when it was a gold box item for $10.  It is worth that, but I will not purchase again for a higher price.  Overall it is easy to make, tastes great and is a great option to have around since it does not require any refrigeration.

This takes that step out, and with the just a few more things (california rolls-avacado,cucumber, crab) you have perfect sushi. The nori is also cut-up into easy to manage strips.

review/summary: Perfect, easy sushi at home
review/text: As soon as I tried this for the first time, I promptly ordered three more cases. The rice is exactly like that in sushi bars - and this is coming from someone who spent many years living in Japan. Not sure why others feel it needs to be seasoned more. The nori sheets are small but I ended up cutting them lengthwise and using them to wrap around a larger portion of rice and my additive of choice (in this case tamago). These kits couldn't be easier to use and anyone, including teens and kids, can do it. Yes, you can assemble your own ingredients separately to make sushi, but for those of us that don't have the time or inclination, these kits are awesome. My only comment is that each kit is supposed to serve two people but realistically it is a meal for one.

review/summary: ALMOST PERFECT
review/text: I bought this sushi making package with a lot of hesitation. How could this really be good?  I am happy to report that I still don't know how but that it is really good.<br /><br />This package contains a bowl of sushi rice (for microwave use only) that's ready in 1 minute.  The rice tastes good straight out of the bowl and there is plenty of it so no need to skimp. You need to provide any additional filling and the wrappers stick to themselves easily.  They also include a packet of seasoned soy sauce.  No other condiments were provided.  A bonus is that it does not need refrigeration and is great in a clutch for a light meal.<br /><br />Although it is not a complete package (excludes fillings), adding your own food to the sushi rolls is what makes this kit a true gem.  My picky kids can add anything they like to make their own personalized sushi rolls.  They also love helping!  It's a great way to sneak in some veggies (cucumbers & carrots) too.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this sushi roll kit was the length of the wrappers; they are a little too big to be bite size, especially for the younger crowd.  It's minor compared to the rest but it's good to know exactly what you are getting before buying.

review/summary: Great for having sushi on the go
review/text: I skeptically purchased this kit at my local grocery store. I was curious since I loved sushi, but I figured that it would end up being a bland & unpalatable mess that I would regret having spent money on. When I made it I was pleasantly surprised. The rice came out incredibly well, especially for microwave rice. (If I were to serve it to someone out of the package they probably would not be able to tell it was microwaved.) The seaweed is seasoned, which is good because it would otherwise had ended up as a rather bland dish. The soy sauce is ok. I can't really tell the difference between the packet it came with & soy sauce in a bottle.<br /><br />My only complaints would be that the seaweed strips are too thin to roll anything decently. I know that they are supposed to be thin, but they are not supposed to have little holes in them because the factory tried to use as little seaweed as possible to make the nori. It's still rollable & enjoyable, but you will need to use a little bit of caution in making it. My other concern would be that the soy sauce is the only condiment offered. It would be nice to have a tiny packet of wasabi to go with it.<br /><br />Ultimately I will buy this again & often. It is fun to make & yummy to eat!

review/summary: Fantastic taste, but a little messy
review/text: We were really surprised at how good the sushi wraps tasted.  They tasted just like the ones we get at the local sushi bar.  The only problem is being able to roll them like they do in the restaurants.  The sticky rice is REALLY sticky, so it's a little hard to spread on the small pre-cut seaweed paper and roll up.  However, if you can get past that, you will love the taste and the fact it only takes about 5 minutes to prepare.

review/text: Quite tasty! No  flavorings in the rice but still a very nice light lunch. Can be a bit messy for those of us who are not skilled sushi roll wrappers. I have been making this a regular part of my pantry. My kids love it  and it is easy to add seasoned vinegar if we want traditionally flavored sushi rice. The seaweed wrappers are small and occasionally have a few holes but are quite good. This company also sells small bowls of the sticky rice alone  if you don't want the seaweed and soy sauce.  both are great and very easy to prepare.

review/summary: A little messy, but fun!
review/text: I love eating sushi, but ordering from my local sushi place is just too expensive! Also, I'm a vegetarian, so it's hard to find places with a plethora of options, other than the standard avo-cucumber rolls. I decided I wanted to try my hand at making my own sushi, but I was a little nervous about buying the right type of rice, nori, inside ingredients and wasn't sure I wanted to buy a full out kit if I wasn't going to use it very often. I decided this would be a good product that would be that intermediate step - not doing all the work myself, but trying it out nonetheless.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- You can put whatever you'd like inside (I like sweet potato or banana rolls myself!).<br />- Easy to make! Just pop the rice bowl in the microwave, spread some rice on the nori, throw a couple ingredients inside, and you're good to go.<br />- You don't have to have just one type of sushi! I'd rather have 10 pieces, each with slightly different contents than 8 pieces that are exactly the same. This allows me to do such.<br />- Easy to bring for work, and like an earlier reviewer mentioned, a fun conversation starter at lunch! Just chop up a couple veggies, throw them in a zip-lock and ta-da, lunch!<br /><br />Cons<br />- No wasabi. This isn't a big deal for me, as I like my sushi rolls condiment free, but my partner likes his sushi doused in soy sauce and wasabi. It does come with a little soy sauce packet, but that's it.<br />- It's not so much a "roll" as a little packet that you delicately have to put together, then shove in your mouth as quickly as possible to prevent it from falling apart. This may be my own ineptness, but I find it a bit tricky to keep together.<br />- I'm not sure you can make inside out rolls (rice on the outside) with this kit. I don't always love the taste of seaweed, but putting a bit of rice on the outside of my "packet" and putting that side in my mouth first works a little.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun lunch. It's a good size for one person, or for two to share alongside a more substantial meal :]

review/summary: Sushi Making One Bite At A Time
review/text: I purchased this product (3 packs) to make Sushi for our family of four.  The Nori or Seaweed Wrap is very small, a little less than 2" x 4" which makes it very hard to make a simple California Roll with crab, cucumber, and avocado.  Once rolled it wasn't quite big enough to cut, but also made a much bigger single piece of sushi.  The sticky rice was exremely sticky and we had more rice than what the 10 sheets of Nori could take.  Don't recommend for family dining unless your family is looking for a snack and some sticky fun, however, may be perfect for the single person with time to play or only likes a single item in their sushi.  I'll buy the bigger sheets for sushi next time...

review/summary: An excellent product
review/text: Our area grocery stores stopped carrying these, and thank goodness Amazon has them, because I have been craving them like crazy. The kit comes with mini sushi wraps, which at a few inches long and a couple of inches wide are a little small but very delicious. The kit also comes with a little bowl of sticky rice which microwaves in a minute and tastes heavenly. The rice bowl is just enough to cover all of the included sushi wraps well. There is also a little packet of soy sauce that is quite tasty. I go to my local grocery store and get some ordinary imitation crab sticks and an avocado, slice them up, then throw them on the mini nori strips with about a teaspoon of the rice. My finicky family loves these kits too. I just ordered six and I don't think they're going to last long in this house! The kit is soooo much cheaper (and, in our area, tastes better) than going out to a sushi bar. Just be sure that the rice is cooled down before you try to make the rolls or you will burn your fingers and the nori will fall apart.

review/summary: Delicious and Convenient
review/text: My family loves sushi. These little kits seemed like a nifty solution to the problem of not having any sushi restaurants nearby. The rice, soy sauce and nori wrappers are all excellent quality and very tasty. The reason I cannot give this product five stars is due to the tiny nori sheet issue. The nori sheets you get with this kit are stupidly small. It's near impossible to make a decent roll with a single nori sheet. I have been 'gluing' a few nori sheets together with a little water on the edge of each sheet, width-wise, to create a better size roll. My whole family love this product, and will continue to use it. It's the easiest way I've found to make great tasting sushi without much fuss. I'd really love to see Annie Chun's come out with a sushi kit that has larger nori sheets, but until that happens this kit is a nice stop-gap for when you want a quick, fuss-free sushi snack.

review/summary: Yummy and Easy to Make!
review/text: I bought this product in June and my children and I love it very much! It is so easy and fun to make that, although it isnt what I would call cheap-I do enjoy being able to order from time to time.<br /><br />When I last ordered this product from Amazon, the shipping was free, which is very important to me. If you are going to pay a little more for a product, it is good to be able to compensate by getting free shipping. I was sad to see that as of today, the shipping is $10.58. I just can not afford to pay so much for this product, even though we do love it. I am giving the sushi wraps a solid 5 star rating but the price plus the shipping 0 stars.

review/summary: Quick filling lunch
review/text: I love to bring these to work because they don't need a fridge or freezer and they heat up quickly (1 minute!). They are easy to put together, and you can add in veggies easily to make it more filling. My favorite things to add in are avocado or cucumber. The rice doesn't taste like typical sushi rice with rice vinegar, but it is the perfect consistency.<br />I think these are the perfect portion size for a lunch.

review/summary: Good
review/text: Great product!  The  rice is nice and sticky and the nori is crispy and delicious.  The rice isn't technically sushi rice (no flavoring), but it works well.  I didn't find it messy at all.  Get a fork full of rice, grab your nori and smooth the rice down the nori.  Next pick whatever you want  and throw in it and wrap it up.  The picture on the box is deceiving because I doubt you could really get that much stuff in the roll though.  This is a single serve type of thing, not making sushi for your family.  But it's great for some veggies, or crab or a piece of fish.  I think I have found my perfect lunch from now on.

Still, the convenience is mighty nice.

review/text: I bought this product last summer when I was experimenting with buying in bulk while I was living at college over the summer and working for Admissions. I brought in the sushi kit one day and had so much fun surprising all of the counselors with sushi. The sticky rice adheres to the seaweed after it is cooked. The kit is "beginner-friendly" to rolling sushi. At first, I didn't really know what I was doing. The product tastes great even if you don't add meat or vegetables. It's surprisingly filling.

review/text: I was hesitant to purchase this, despite the outstanding reviews, because of the price. I mean, what could be cheaper than rice and toasted seaweed?<br /><br />With that perspective, I was very pleased with these meals/snacks. The rice was more delicious than the freshly made white rice served in many places (possibly even better than the rice in my house) and the wraps are super delicate and with a nice lightly crispy texture that is most enjoyable.<br /><br />If you like sushi wraps and rice, I highly recommend you try these.

review/summary: Really good and quick
review/text: I bought this product at the store rather than online and I enjoyed it a lot. It tastes a lot less vinegary than the real sushi and the major turn on is you can add whatever you want as the filling. I am glad this really doesn't take that much effort to cook. All you have to do is put the rice in the microwave for 1 minute and you are done with the cooking part. Now, the wrapping is a different story. It's not difficult but it's messy and the wraps are brittle, but still usable to wrap, to me but I have fun making them. It also comes with soy sauce but I really didn't need it at all. This product is really easy to make, is a great alternative when you don't want to cook anything or dirty, hardly, any dishes, and you are in control of it. I really like this product a lot and I will definitely buy it again.

review/text: I ordered this when it was the gold box deal and I would order again even at the higher price. Reading the reviews just reaffirms the old adage that you can't please everyone. I'm happy that there is no added flavor in the rice. The rice is quite tasty as it is. Have we gone to a culture that has to modify everything? In today's world we don't taste what we prepared to eat. We only taste the condiments we pour onto or into it. I thought the wraps where big enough. How hard can it be to roll sushi for goodness sakes. I thought the salt taste in the wraps added a little rush to the flavor when I bit into the sushi. All in all I think this is a great option to lunch and a good value. Having to roll your own helps you to slow down your eating and allows to feel full just about the time you munch on the last bite. Tomorrow, I think I'll add some tuna! Yummy!

review/text: The seaweed is excellent quality however you only get to make one piece at a time because the Nori is very small. It's awful if you're making a lot of sushi at once. I prefer larger sheets so I can roll and cut many pieces of sushi. I will not be buying this product again because of this. It was however delicious Nori and good quality rice and very quick to do. It's just no good if you're looking to make more then 10 pieces, plus that causes it to actually take more time then it should.

review/summary: Not for first-timers!
review/text: I actually went to the store looking for some rice so that I could make a meal with fried rice. The store I went to had tons of Asian foods, and this was one of them. Now, I have never had Sushi before, but I've been getting really into Japanese culture and that includes food, so I thought I'd try some. I figured this was an easy way to at least try the Nori with the rice and soy sauce so that I could figure out what to add to customize it to my taste. I'm not real adventurous when it comes to food, so for me to get this was a big deal.<br /><br />The sticky rice really does cook up well, and quite frankly, I love rice, so I'd buy this just to get the nice bowl of rice. It really steams up well in the microwave, and it takes so little time that you will really be amazed. I know it sounds like I'm going on too much about the rice, but the rice that they make for microwaves now tastes like it came out of a microwave, and this did not. After heating the rice, I pulled out the Nori (seaweed) and placed a nice size ball of rice onto the middle of it [Nori] as the packaged says; that's where my experience went bad. I eat by smell, which many people do, and the smell that the hot rice combined with the Nori gave off was horrible and totally ruined the experience for me. I don't know if it was supposed to smell like that or not, but I do know that it wasn't going in my stomach. I did try to finish the rice, and mixed the Soy Sauce with it in the bowl, but the experience was ruined. I really think this is more for those who have eaten Sushi before, and would stay away and hold out for something better if you're looking for a first-time new experience.

review/summary: Vegetarian favorite
review/text: I grew up as a vegetarian, and this is my favorite of the many soy-products out there. The stakes come 4 to a can, submerged in thick, flavorful brown gravy, and are simple to prepare--just heat and serve. I usually accompany them with macaroni and cheese and whatever vegetable I'm in the mood for. However, they are also good in sandwiches or with mashed potatoes or rice. If you are not a vegetarian, you will probably find the flavor closest to Salisbury steak, though the texture is very different. That said, I recommend that those who are not familiar with vegetarian soy-products think of them as something totally other, rather than the meat product they are meant to replace, and enjoy them for their own merits. Other soy-meat favorites: Worthington Prosage, Morningstar Grillers, Worthington Chili, and Loma Linda Fried Chik'N with Gravy.

review/text: This is the first Loma Linda or Worthington meat analog that was not thrilled with. I love most of their products and use them all the time, so I didn't hesitate to order a case of Swiss Stakes. For my taste, they are bland, blah and boring. As a stand-alone Swiss-style "steak", they just were pretty tasteless. The gravy is OK, but nothing to write home about. I'm using up the remaining cans by cutting the "stakes" up and putting them in Chinese dried noodle soups. I'm also thinking I can make them into burgers, as long as I load lots of ketchup and mustard on them.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I was raised eating meat substitutes as my mother, now 86 with no cardio vascular problems, has been a vegetarian from birth.  This product is delicious.  I like it because it does not try to taste like real meat.  It has a delicious savory flavor all it's own.  For someone just starting out as a vegetarian and wanting something easy to use and tasty, this is it.  My son, who is an avid meat eater, loves this just as much as I do. When I have this for dinner he does not mind going meatless.  I just wish it came with more gravy for putting over noodles or rice.

review/summary: More of a Salisbury Steak
review/text: I don't why it's labeled as "Swiss Stake", because it really isn't anything of the sort.  I was expecting something with roughly flavor of Swiss Steak as I have known it to be.  As I have always understood it (and have made it), Swiss Steak has a tomato-based sauce with onions and generally bell peppers and garlic, etc.  This product is NOT that at all.  Given the "Swiss Stake" product title. I couldn't even given this 1 star.  This is more of a "Salisbury Stake" in a standard brown gravy, that has no vegetables at all in it and tastes nothing like a Swiss Steak sauce would. This basically a soy "hamburger" patty in a smooth brown gravy.  Given that vegetarian "meats" have never really resembled the texture of their namesakes anyway, I didn't really expect (but WAS hoping) that the texture would resemble that of flank steak or round steak that Swiss steak is made with, but I DID expect the sauce flavor and components to resemble Swiss Steak.  It doesn't.  With a title of "Salisbury Stake", I'd give it 3 stars at best.

I've been eating LL's Swiss Steaks for years and have not been able to find them at my local grocery store after relocating.  So glad to find them on Amazon at such a great deal. Simply love them!  Makes a great dinner with pasta or mashed potatoes and the gravy is divine with added sauteed mushrooms, onions and mixed bell peppers in olive oil. Really "beefs" up my weekly menue, LOL. Highly recommend this product, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.  Amazon's delivery was super fast. Will definately keep the automatic reorder going.

review/text: This Kashi cereal packs a nutritional punch, with 9 grams of protein (including soy protein) plus 6 grams of fiber.  It has a nicely sweet taste similar to Sugar Smacks for kids.  As promised, it is definitely crunchy, but I actually found it a bit too crunchy--my jaw started to ache after just a few spoonfuls!  However, I found that if I gave the cereal some time to soften a bit in the milk first, I could enjoy it much more.  Recommended as a healthy, tasty way to start your day.

If you like your beans "al dente", then that's the way you will have them.<br /><br />I cooked them for an additional 45 minutes (1 hour total) and they are pretty soft but there are some adzuki beans that do not sprout and are hard as "soft" rocks... Just be warned. They have to cook even longer to become soft and not crunchy.<br /><br />Other that that, I like the beans. An yes, Costco has the same bag for under 10 bucks.

It depends on how you like your beans, but I do 20+ minutes simmering at low heat, and let it set 10-15 minutes.  They're tasty enough, but after cooking, they look completely dull and not that appetizing.  Other than looks, they make a great topper for salads.

review/text: These do not cook up in 15 minutes, which is the main reason I bought them. In addition to the longer cook time, you have to add time to sort through the beans to find the ones that didn't sprout. After cooking, the unsprouted ones will be more brightly colored and smaller than the sprouted ones, since they are nowhere near cooked through.  The unsprouted ones are like rocks; they might damage your teeth. My recommendations is that you eat these carefully, even after sorting out the unsprouted ones.

review/text: I am a distance runner and depend on beans and corn for my main source of carbs as I have insensitivities that causes body inflammation when I eat rice or gluten (wheat).<br /><br />PROS:<br />These beans are great, organic, sprouted, tastey and I have no food insensitivities with them.<br />They are very versatile.  I can make soups, chili, or eat them without any additional spices.<br />I also make desserts with shaved ice and fruit and use these beans instead of sugary red bean paste.<br /><br />Cons:<br />These beans DO NOT thoroughly cook within 15 minutes when following directions.  I am not sure which bean doesn't fully cook, but it remains hard as a rock so be careful if you have weak teeth.<br />I would suggest using a rice pressure cooker to cook these.  The rice cooker cooks these in about 20 minutes and I did not notice any hard beans when cooked in the pressure cooker.<br />**This same 3lb bag goes for under $10 at Costco.

I agree they do take much longer than the 15 minutes states to cook them, but once you have that figured out,hey are great. I can't believe how good they taste. I just added a diced onion, some garlic, a can of tomatoes with a bunch of water and a little salt and pressure cooked them (maybe a cup and a half?) for 10 minutes and voila the fastest, healthiest meal with left overs! And it happens to be vegan.

I looked up lentil soup recipes and tried this cooked in chicken broth and made like a soup.  I sauteed onions and garlic in olive oil. Added chicken broth, beans, carrots, curry powder, ketchup, and cooked for about 35 minutes.  Then processed in the blender to make smooth.  Added lemon juice and olive oil and this made a great soup.  If you don't like the texture of beans, the blender fixes that nicely.  You can also do these with chili powder and make it have a mexican/refried bean flavor.  great product.  very versitile.

review/summary: Nosh that grief away
review/text: I tend not to get too caught up in the hype around celebrity deaths.  Tim Russert's death was big news.  That's a special perk of being part of the machinery that decides for the rest of us what is and what isn't news.  But it was also a story because he really does seem genuinely well liked.<br /><br />I liked the guy.  I didn't know him but I saw him once riding the T in Brookline.  He was talking on the cell phone and had that big friendly smile that people found so disarming.  Seemed like a good guy.  This idea that he asked the tough questions bothers me though.  Maybe he did ask tougher questions than your average news man, but nobody has been tough enough on these brazen gonifs that currently run the country.  They couldn't get away with half of what they do if the news media wasn't at least passively complicit.<br /><br />But I like Tim Russert.  He went from Buffalo to the East Coast, a trajectory I know, and I recognize that temperament he portrayed.  East Coast keenness softened by that charming Midwest salt-of-the-Earth spirit.  And, though I sometimes resent the narcissism of baby-boomers working out their father issues in the public, Tim Russert's devotion to his working class dad appears to come from a place of such wholesomeness and decency that it is hard to be critical.<br /><br />Buffalo is an underrated city, by the way.  Like many an unsung medium-sized city, you have to know where to look, but it has its own kind of hipness.  Buffalo wings really do come from Buffalo, in much the same way that french-fries really don't come from France.  Frank's hot sauce is the real deal, the original formula, and you can get it anywhere.  I can stake my entire fictional on-line reputation on this because I have high level informants in Buffalo who tell me this is true.  Frank and Teresa's hot sauce, in 1964, at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York, was the secret ingredient for the first wings.  Yep.  The same one, right there on North and Main by the General Hospital.  They also make a jambalaya with Frank's hot sauce and kielbasa.<br /><br />Good sauce.  Hot enough to spice things up but not to the point where the heat masks the flavor.  You can use it for wings or you can splash it on your eggs in the morning.  Know what I did the other day?  I was at the bottom of the bag of chips, where you get just those tiny fragments and the greasy pulverized chip residue.  I poured everything into a bowl, covered it in blue cheese particles and threw in some Frank's hot sauce.  Microwaved it and ate it with a spoon.  Really uncouth, I'm glad nobody saw it.  But, seriously, not bad.

review/text: This is by far the best of their flavors that I have tried. I have had the Mamma-Mia and the Thai-Dyed. This has a good jalapeno taste along with the cheddar. Other that the powder goo you get on your fingers from the flavoring, these are good eats.

review/summary: Not a good decaf
review/text: I tried this decaf - in words it was OK, not really good.  It tastes like a very mild blend, which is probably why I can't say much for it.  <p>It froths up in the Senseo, just like any other pod, so it salvages a couple of stars, anyway.

review/summary: light blend
review/text: The decaf is fine and I use it with a pod of dark roast to create a half-caf 8 oz cup. Low rating for current price gouging. Should be 25% of the cost. Ouch!

review/summary: Just not that good.
review/text: I don't know why anyone would pay 3 times the price for this coffee.<br /> don't be fooled, there are other brands that will work with your coffee<br />maker just as well without the price gouging.......

review/summary: Was this dealer really an Amazon site?
review/text: We like Senseo Coffee Pods very much; however, when my order arrived, I realized that I had paid as much for one bag of 18 pods as I normally pay for a whole box of packages.  I filled out a return slip and mailed the one bag back for a refund--which I have not received.  I have ordered several times from Amazon and in the past was always satisfied--until this order.  I didn't believe my computer when it flashed that this was a fraudulent site!

review/text: This is a light breakfast brew.  It is not for those who drink dark, black coffee. It works perfectly for me. No bitterness.
