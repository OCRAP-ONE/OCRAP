review/summary: Wow! these are good!
review/text: I had these hot and spicy peanuts while travelling through an airport.  They are so good, they have the right amount of spice, they're hot without killing you.  They are really the classic pairing with an icy cold beer.  If you're doing a gift for a beer lover these are essential.  They do leave seasoning on your hands so you'll need a wipee or good finger lickin' afterward, LOL, but they're worth it.  I immediately came home and looked these up just to purchase.  They're a cayenne powder, maybe even hungarian paprika taste.

review/summary: The Best Dressing That I've Found~
review/text: 'Kraft Greek Vinaigrette Dressing' is my new favorite salad dressing, even more so than 'Good Seasons Italian', which had formerly stood the test of time as my all-time favorite.  This dressing has only 2 carbs/serving and only 1 sugar/serving, which for me, makes it an ideal low-carb choice, for those of us who embrace a low-carb lifestyle.  It embodies a true Greek feta-cheese flavor throughout this recipe.  I do enjoy this offering from Kraft Foods.  A real winner!

review/text: Love that grilled chicken at your favorite Greek restaurant?  Here's a way you can make it at home:<br /><br />Generously coat the chicken with the Kraft Greek Vinaigrette dressing, and let sit several hours in the refrigerator - overnight is best.  Throw the chicken on the barbeque, grill, and ENJOY!<br /><br />I'm getting hungry just thinking about it....

review/summary: Great Mexican vanilla - rich strong flavor
review/text: Makes the best homemade vanilla ice cream.  I have bought 5 "mexican vanilla" brands in the last 6 months.  This is the only one with the great mexican vanilla flavor I remembered. I can't find this flavor locally, even in the specialty stores.<br />Claims to be 3-4 times stronger than regular vanilla.  It is smooth enough that you can use more than regular and really get a great strong flavor.<br />Ingredients:  water, alcohol, propylene glycol, sugar, pure vanilla, natural and artificial flavors, and caramel color.

review/text: I have been on a hunt for a great tasting cherry syrup to add to seltzer water. After trying many brands, this one finally did the trick. It's very flavorful and even has a great aftertaste. I would say the flavor is more black cherry than plain cherry, however. My mother tried a glass of my cherry soda, and she said that it brought back memories of drinking a fresh cherry soda at the drugstore in the 1950's. Definitely a thumbs up!

I've been using the SodaStream Red Bull knockoff until I tasted this. It tastes like a slightly tangy strawberry Fanta and it doesn't have the bad aftertaste that comes with most energy drinks. Looking at the ingredients, the only energy ingredient I see is caffeine, which probably explains why it doesn't have the aftertaste (no taurine).

review/summary: Quite possibly the best protein shake, ever
review/text: This is a great product!  It is the best protein shake I've ever come across.  Here's why:<br />-Only 180 calories.  So many protein shakes on the market have 300 + calories.  That's great if you're looking to turn into the next Arnold, but if you're like me and just want to get in better shape and tone your muscles than it's nice to not consume so many calories.<br />-There's only like 1 g of sugar.<br />-Unlike most protein shakes/meal replacement shakes I've had, you really truly can make this one with water.  Most other shakes are so funky that you have to use milk or soymilk.  Not this one.  It literally works with water.  I use 8 oz of water, a few cubes of ice, and blend.<br />-It's THICK.  Really thick.  It's like a thick milkshake, so it's really filling.  Fills me up as much as a meal if not more.<br />-Tastes GREAT.  I love the taste!

review/summary: Best Taste and No Aspartame!
review/text: Building muscle while burning fat became paramount to me while on the Body For Life program several years ago.  After being on the program for 9 months, I developed muscle for the first time in my life in addition to losing lots of fat.  I attribute a great deal of my success to fueling my body with the right foods...including meal replacement drinks twice a day to keep my metabolism revving.<br /><br />Finding the right meal replacement powder (MRP) for those two meals a day became almost an obsession.<br /><br />I had four main criteria:<br />1.  Low sugar content (very important to me as the more sugar I have, the more I crave it)<br />2.  High amounts of vitamins and minerals<br />3. Good tasting without the Aspartame (I have a sensitivity to it)<br />4. Easy to mix--especially on the run<br /><br />I did a lot of research and a lot of testing. My quest for the best took me through chalky tasting ones, chemical tasting ones, downright nasty tasting ones, and difficult-to-mix ones.<br /><br />Finally, I got around to Labrada's Lean Body for Her shakes. I originally tried them because of their low sugar content but ended up loving how much energy they gave me and the great taste. I mainly used vanilla because I could mix nut butters and fruit to mix up the flavors. Loved them!<br /><br />Due to health issues, I went off program for the last two years, but I recently recommitted myself. Because of my previous success with Labrada Lean Body for Her, I went back to using it for two of my six meals each day. Right away I noticed there are a few things different with tLabrada's current MRP.<br /><br />I don't know how they did it, but they made the vanilla even better! I got the "Soft Vanilla" flavor and it taste just like ice cream! It is also even easier to mix. It seems like the powder itself is ground finer, which is probably why.<br /><br />The nutritional information is:<br />Calories 190<br />Calories From Fat 30<br />Total Fat 3.5g<br />Saturated Fat 1g<br />Trans Fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 20mg<br />Sodium 300mg<br />Potassium 360mg<br />Total Carbohydrates 9g<br />Dietary Fiber 3g<br />Sugars 1g<br />Protein 30g<br /><br />Lastly, while this may not be important to others, I truly love the fact that the tear strip on the envelopes actually work and are easy to open. A small detail perhaps but just the right added benefit to top off an already great product.<br /><br />As on most things, the amazon.com price is great...and I save even more money by using the Subscribe & Save. I'm not sure who controls shipping speed on the S&S, amazon.com or the seller themselves, but they certainly ship fast!

review/text: I prefer the vanilla over the chocolate.  But with both I make some modifications.  The directions say to add 12oz. of liquid.  I used 24-32oz.  This way the shake is not too thick, it controls my hunger/cravings for longer periods of time, and it helps me to meet my daily water needs.  It only takes two shakes a day using the 32oz. modification to meet the recommended 8 glasses of water a day.

review/summary: chocolate is a lot better
review/text: I decided to try this product because it was cheap and I'm usually a vanilla person. I love vanilla everything and because I had already tried the chocolate version and wanted a change I thought this would be perfect. Turns out it wasn't. The taste is horrible. Even thought there's no aspartame it tastes like there's artificial sweeteners in it. The first time I tried it it made me gag. The only way I was able to finish the box was to put it in my shaker and just take very big gulps without breathing. That way it was over in less than 30sec. I've tried the chocolate and at fist didn't like it, but this stuff makes the chocolate taste like candy. The chocolate tastes just like chocolate (more like hot cocoa), but without  added sugar. This stuff does not resemble vanilla ice cream at all.<br />  I'm not gonna completely bash it however, because how many protein shakes actually taste good? Despite the taste, it did what it was supposed to do. I drank one of these and it kept me full for three hours which is great for only 180cal. These shakes have helped me control my eating and keep me on my 1200cal a day diet (200 cal every 3 hours). I never experienced gas, bloating or any kind of stomach cramps. If you can get over the taste which won't last too long if you just gulp them down then this product isn't too bad. I would recommend trying the chocolate flavor, however. It tastes more natural. I have yet to try the strawberry.

What's that all about?  It was exactly what I didn't want.  Look above in the ingredients list and you'll see that it's missing.  I got the Chocolate and haven't checked the strawberry or vanilla, but I'll bet corn syrup solids is listed on those ingredient lists on those boxes, too.  Is this some kind of trick?  I'll use what I purchased, but I'm not impressed at all with this bit of business.  In looking at other meal replacement shakes I remember some of them said "no corn syrup solids."  Now I know what they were talking about.  Buyer Beware.

review/summary: Great taste and thickness, very filling!
review/text: I stumbled upon the Lean Body For Her meal replacement shakes as I was doing some research for a high protein diet.  What I absolutely loved about these from the nutritional information alone is the low sugar content.  This was very important to me because a lot of the alternatives such as Special K's protein shake, for example, are quite needlessly high in sugar.<br /><br />I read some of the other reviews and bought a Blender Bottle to mix these with.  Not only do the Labrada shakes mix extremely well in these, they mix quick!<br /><br />The taste (I got these in the Chocolate Ice Cream) is really quite astounding for the low sugar content.  The texture is thick and it really is almost as wonderful as drinking a shake from the ice cream shop.  There is a bit of an after taste, but it is so slight it's barely noticeable--another huge plus from me.<br /><br />I'm going to keep using these for my breakfast meal replacement, and I'll try all the flavors eventually!  I'm so happy I found this product.

review/summary: Better than I expected
review/text: I'm not a breakfast person, and my usual first-meal is a cup of coffee or the occasional unhealthy option of a bagel & cream cheese, a muffin or something with bacon in it. On the days that I skip breakfast, I'm ravenous by noon and find myself easily caving into temptation of french fries or the pasta special at the lunch stop downstairs.<br /><br />I bought these meal replacement packs as part of a plan to get back into shape. It's only been a few days and so far I've just replaced breakfast with these shakes. I've been pleasantly surprised at the taste and how long it keeps me satisfied without making my hunger go out of control.<br /><br />In conjunction with this purchase, I also got myself a single-serving, personal blender and a shaker cup. The personal blender has been a PHENOMENAL accessory and I don't even want to bother with the shaker cup.<br /><br />I have a feeling the powder mixed only with water or milk as directed would be unacceptable to my palate. Instead, I've been adding a handful of frozen berries, low fat soy milk and buzzing it up in the blender with a few ice cubes for that perfect smoothie consistency. On days when I need an extra pick-me up, I mix in a bit of energy drink I haven't been craving coffee (flavor), but still need the caffeine kick. So far, so good! I'll report back if this product has any lasting power/results.

review/summary: Good stuff.
review/text: This is by far the best protein drink I have found for the quanity and price. I mix it with milk, ice, and either frozen strawberries or a banana and it tastes pretty darn good! Keeps me full for quite awhile. I have only tried the chocolate. But I have purchased more than once so that should say something right there.

review/summary: Great taste!
review/text: My first meal replacement was Slim Fast, unfortunatly it didn't work for me. Before I decided to try this product, I did some research. This is a good protein shake. It has 180 calories and 30g of protein! Low sugar compare to other drinks. I drink it once/day after a 1 hour workout for five days a week. The chocolate tastes great. No need to add the extras like ice, juices, or fruits for better taste. Instantly stopped my hunger for a couple of hours. Gives me a good amount of energy. Not gassy! The packets are great for traveling.<br />UPDATE - 3/10/11<br />So far, chocolate it the best flavor. Vanilla tastes like lite sweet milk. Haven't tried strawberry yet.

review/text: Lean Body is a wonderful replacement product. We liked the chocolate flavor the best. We would either low fat milk or if we were making a special dinner treat add low fat choc ice cream and peanut butter. Too good!! The product is a little expensive but the convenience is worth it. We have tried Slim Fast and my son and I prefer this product.

review/text: I bought this stuff on a whim as I started my diet.  I needed ideas for snacks, as I'm supposed to have 3 snacks each day.  I think both the chocolate and vanilla are great!  The first time I tried it, I simply stirred it with milk.  It was pretty good.  The next time, I put it in the blender with a couple of ice cubes, and it tasted really good.  Now I experiment with various soy and rice milks and usually add 1/4 to 1/2 cup frozen fruit or 1/2 banana.  I highly recommend this product as a meal replacement or snack.  I haven't tried the strawberry, so I can't speak to that flavor, but I'm sure it's good, too.

review/summary: Be careful!!! Contains plant estrogen!
review/text: This product contains soy isoflavins, the plant equivalent of estrogen. This has different effects on different people. For some, it makes them more fertile (see articles on soy and fertility). For those who use oral contraceptives with estrogen, this product can make you physically sick, including migraine-like headaches and diarrhea. If you take oral contraceptives and suffer ANY adverse consequences after using this product, STOP and find a non-soy replacement like Biox Whey Isolate.

review/text: I've tried a lot of different high protein/low sugar meal replacement shakes over the years and I know none of them are ever going to taste that great. Some have actually made me gag :-0  But this one is pretty tolerable (although a little too sweet tasting), mixes easily with water and a spoon.  You can make it as thick or thin as you want by adjusting how much water you mix in.  I think 8oz as recommended on the box is the perfect consistency. I've only tried the Strawberry so far.  Now lets see what it does for my body, that will be my next review in another month...

review/summary: Whats wrong with you people?
review/text: Oddly there is absolutely no mention in any of these reviews about how much protein there is in this protein based product. Does anyone know? after all its a protein meal replacement shake. I don't care about how pretty the box is or how little the calorie content is or if it tastes great. If a person is not getting the proper amount of proteins to support proper workout then the product is useless. Protein, Thats the whole point. i wouldnt buy this product based on the reviews at all because they miss the effectivness of most crucial ingredient. Sigh, For the record it has 30 grams of protein. (thanks for clarifying that for me Gordon.)

review/text: The Gluten Free Seasoned Coating Mix is delicious.  It enhances the flavor on vegetables, chicken, even meatballs.  Everything I make tastes so good.  My whole family loves it, even those who aren't gluten intolerant.  I buy it by the case because I don't like to run out of it.  The price Amazon has listed - .21/oz doesn't calculate out.  $19.49 for 3-10oz boxes = .65oz.  Which is twice what other suppliers charge. I would love to order from Amazon and I would love to get it at the advertised .21/oz. The figures just don't add up.

I admit that i did opt for 3-5 day shipping as opposed to next-day (which would have doubled the price!)However, apparently 3 of the apples and all of the pears were brown in the middle and therefore inedible. If there is an issue with freshness, there should be something on the seller's website to indicate that there is a risk in the slower shipping: it probably would have resulted in my purchasing a less perishable product.

review/summary: Not good for smaller dogs, OK for larger dogs.
review/text: I was visiting my boyfriend's parents house. They have a pomeranian/chi mix. I bought these little guys for him so that he could have an edible chew since it looked like he had very little toys, and has probably never had an edible chew.<br /><br />I didn't know that he was a hoarder. He was so afraid that my dog would steal his bone (which my dog was chewing on one too), that he tried to swallow the whole thing. Resulting in him choking, and gagging spitting up blood.<br /><br />I thought I had killed their dog!! VERY scary.<br />If your dog is food agressive, please do not buy these for your dog especially if you have more than one dog in the household.<br /><br />On the Up side of things, my collie/hound mix loves them and gobbled them down in about 3 minutes. I would not typically buy this size treat for her (but these were not for her at the time of buying).

review/text: I want to avoid sugar intake as much as possible.  I have friends who come by who are diabetic and I don't need the calories.

It's also not as caustic as Mountain Dew or Pepsi Max is, at least to my pallet.  Just a clean flavor, but not as light as flavored water.  Yummy.

review/summary: It was a good idea but they ruined it by adding BHT!
review/text: My son has autism and is allergic to gluten among other things.  I was so excited to see that Rice Krispies had come out with a Gluten Free version until I read the ingredients.  BHT is NOT healthy!  It is an ingredient in jet fuels, rubber, petroleum products, electrical transformer oil, and embalming fluid.  The MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) for BHT says the following:  Do NOT let this chemical enter the environment.  Combustible.  Ingestion causes Abdominal pain. Confusion. Dizziness. Nausea. Vomiting.  The substance may have effects on the liver.  The substance is harmful to aquatic organisms.  When Chex went gluten-free, they did the same thing.  Yes, taking out the gluten is healthy, but adding BHT is not!  I would have loved to have been able to buy my son "normal" cereal, with cute characters on the front.  He would have loved it, but in the autism community, we are trying to get the toxins out of our kids, not put them in.  I will continue to be a Erewhon Twice Rice Cereal customer.  At over $4 per box, the price is steep, but I know the only ingredients my son is ingesting are organic brown rice, organic brown rice syrup, honey, and sea salt and he loves it.  Shame on Kellogg's for putting BHT in our children's cereals!

I think I need to start a weekly delivery via subscribe and save.  They make me feel normal.  :)

review/summary: Gluten Free Rice Krispies
review/text: I was thrilled to find the new gluten free Rice Krispies at Walmart for only $3.11 a box. However, I was not thrilled with the taste. The cereal does snap, crackle and pop right when you add milk and is nice and crispy. However this doesn't last long. They get a little soggy and strange tasting. I put some blackberries on top and that made it more eatable. So eat fast while it is crispy. The brown rice just doesn't do it. Why couldn't Kellog have used white rice like the original? I am new to gluten-free foods and was really looking forward to this cereal.

review/summary: Nice Try, but....
review/text: I was thrilled to see Kellogg's coming out with a gluten free version of Rice Krispies...that is until I saw that they were going to be made with brown rice. That is the absolute first mistake. They should have just followed suit with the way General Mills altered all of their Chex cereals and replaced the malt with molasses. I decided to give these a try just for giggles. Well I can say that I am very disappointed and I now have four boxes of Rice Krispies that are going to waste. The texture is just like all of the other brown rice cereals out there -- hard and burnt-tasting. Kellogg's, you can't be using brown rice to make Rice Krispies, it just doesn't work! I have yet to try these in Rice Krispie treats, lets hope the marshmallows and butter mask the flavor. The texture is nice for a few minutes until the milk gets to them but then its like eating paste. With the evolution of gluten free foods it is so much easier to get gluten free versions of traditional favorites to taste like the original. Gluten free consumers are no longer willing to lower their standards -- PLEASE Kellogg's, take a cue from General Mills and make this cereal gluten free without changing the recipe entirely!<br /><br />Update: I tried making Rice Krispie treats. I was sure to add extra marshmallows to mask the toasted flavor. They were pretty decent I will say but I'm still disappointed that I now have 4 boxes of cereal to make Rice Krispie treats with, hopefully I can use the boxes before they expire.

review/summary: Snap, Crackle, and Pop the Whole Grain Way
review/text: One of the main draws of this cereal was not only that it was gluten free, but also that it was made with whole grain brown rice.  Whole grains both taste better and are better for you, and with the variety of whole grain products on the market today, there is no reason why anyone should settle for less.  Unless, of course, you are gluten-free, and then your problems take on an entirely different nature.  So it is with an eye for health and not just for Celiacs that I write this review.<br /><br />First of all, as a gluten-free cereal, it does what it sets out to do: recreate the experience of regular Rice Krispies.  And it does!  The familiar snap, crackle, and pop are there, and though the cereal gets soggy a bit more quickly than the original, the diference is negligible.  And of course, since there's no gluten, it won't make those of us who are gluten-sensitive sick.<br /><br />But nutritionally, how does it compare to its gluten-laced counterpart?  Well, first of all, it's heavier.  The serving size is merely one cup compared to the original's 1 1/4 cups per serving.  But one serving of each is still 33 grams.  The gluten free version is very slightly lower in calories (120/serving as opposed to 128), but a little higher in fat (1 gram of fat and 10 calories from fat as opposed to 0.3 grams of fat and 3 calories from fat).  It seems like a lot, but both are still extremely low-fat, and a serving of gluten-free rice krispies has a whopping 2% of the daily recommended amount of fat.  Interestingly enough, the original has 0.1 g of saturated fat, while the gluten-free version has none at all.<br /><br />The gluten-free one is lower in both sodium (190 mg vs. 299 mg) and sugar (&lt;1 g vs. 3.1 g).  It's higher in dietary fiber (1 g vs. 0.3 g) and protein (3 g vs. 2.3 g).  Those last two may seem pretty insignificant, but if you're on a gluten-free diet you have to work hard to get as much fiber as you can (because most of it in a normal diet is found in whole wheat bread).<br /><br />Where am I going with this?  Well, it would seem that the gluten free rice krispies , though having a tiny bit more fat than the original, overall is moderately to significantly healthier.  And not just for people on a gluten-free diet--vegetarians would benefit from knowing that the gluten-free version has more protein in it, and it is a good complement to the other incomplete protein in soy milk or almond milk.<br /><br />On the issue of the ingredients:  Traditional Rice Krispies contain rice, sugar, salt, malt flavoring, iron, Vitamin c, Vitamin E, niacinamide, Vitamin A, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B1, folic acid, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin D.  Gluten Free Rice Krispies contains whole grain brown rice, sugar, and a tiny bit of salt and BHT.  Impressive enough as it is that the gluten-free version can have fewer ingredients, supplements, and coloring agents than its original counterpart, it still contains the preservative BHT.  BHT is there to increase the shelf life of your cereal and to maintain the vitamins naturally found in brown rice.  However, while BHT is marketed in health food stores as a healthy supplement, some people are concerned about it causing adverse health effects.  Regardless, it is approved as a food additive by the FDA, and we consume it in vastly greater quantities in many other types of food, such as soy sauce and potato chips.<br /><br />Unless you are actively avoiding any and all forms of BHT or BHA (and if so, I congratulate you for your determination), I would recommend you give this cereal a try.  It is tasty, healthy, and a great way to start the morning!

review/summary: The brown rice is just fine, but overpriced
review/text: I don't have a problem with the brown rice (I prefer it, even) and am a little mystified to why so many people seem to hate it, but I do agree that they should have replaced the malt flavoring with something else, because this variety is a little too plain-tasting. Not at all bad though, and it's nice to be able to eat Rice Krispies again - although I might add that it's ridiculous that it took so long for a cereal made of *RICE* to go gluten free.<br /><br />However, it's absolutely absurd that they cost more than regular Rice Krispies.  General Mills just did a reformulation of Chex rather than make a whole new gluten free variety, but I guess Kelloggs wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to further gouge a group of people who are already paying hand over fist for gluten free foods.  It's just RICE, there is nothing special about this cereal that should make it cost any more than the regular variety.

review/summary: Not Even Close To The Original
review/text: I was super stoked when I saw that Kellogg's was offering gluten free Rice Krispies. I mean, it's rice so it should be gluten free, right?! Well, like communism, that's a great theory. These GF krispies could not be farther from what actual rice krispies taste like. Blerg. They taste like cardboard and turn to mush in your mouth, even when you use them to make rice krispie treats.<br /><br />I think it was the choice to use brown rice. I'm not sure why they chose to do this, possibly because many people who are gluten free are also very concerned about eating "natural" foods. I'm all for balanced nutrition and whole grains, but for the love of god, I'm gluten free because I have Celiac. I've given up enough. Must I also suffer through Rice Krispies that taste like sticks?! If I wanted some hippie-dippie cereal, I would have no problem choosing one from the vast array of buckwheat twigs and no-sugar added corn knobs at Whole Foods. But I don't want that; I want Rice Krispies. I desire to drench these little pellets in melted marshmallow and margarine, so let's not kid ourselves: this is not a health food to many people, and I'm not sure why they tried to turn it into one.<br /><br />In short, these get a "participant" ribbon for showing up. If they would have tried to stay closer to the original recipe without the malt flavoring, then we'd be talking about a big ol' blue 1st place award, but alas, it was not to be.

review/summary: Great idea -- poor execution
review/text: I have not been gluten free for that long that I don't recall what Rice Krispies tasted like, and this GF cereal version is not a good approximation of the original. The cereal has little if any flavor. A big food company like Kellogg's should be able to come up with an acceptable barley Malt substitute that adds some of the original flavor. With GF Rice, Corn, Cinnamon, Honey Nut Chex now widely available in grocery stores, at reasonable prices, and which taste EXACTLY the same as the original versions, why would you want to choose a cereal as bland & flavorless as these GF Rice Krispies. C'Mon Kellogg's, you can do better.

review/summary: A step in the right direction.
review/text: I was excited to try these- both my husband and myself, as well as one of our two kids- have to avoid gluten. We generally eat Chex and Erewhon cereals- but I was hoping to add some variety. I'm always happy to see companies adding gluten free products to their lines. I give it 3 stars for that reason- they're trying.<br /><br />The price initially wasn't too much more because the first boxes that arrived at our grocery store had attached coupons, but those coupons were limited and other manufacturer's coupons haven't worked on the gluten free version.<br /><br />Price aside, these make for awful cereal. Unless you can inhale the bowl in seconds, the cereal gets mushy fast, the milk takes on an odd taste and flat out looses any appeal. The "puffed rice" I remember eating in the 80s was better. They make okay treats, but they seem to dissolve when mixed with the butter/marshmellow mixture, again leaving something to be desired.<br /><br />We normally kill 3-4 boxes of cereal a week, between breakfast, snacks and baking (modified Chex mix, our version of nut free puppy chow- and I was hoping to add Rice Krispie Treats) but the initial 4 boxes of the GF Rice Krispies are going to last awhile. I'll stick to Erewhon Crispy Brown Rice and Chex while Kelloggs fine tunes their product.

I don't taste any of the aftertaste that others mentioned, and they beat any other rice crispy GF cereal on the market for taste.  They do get a bit spongy when the milk soaks them, but I remember the regular cereal going limp too.  I'm SO happy I found these.  They obviously aren't "wholesome" because they are processed food and DO come in a box.  I'm not overly concerned about the small amount of additives in them, nor the sugar, because I am (as all gluten people should be) well aware that processed GF foods aren't healthy. HOWEVER, when nothing else will do and all you want is a bowl of Rice Krispies, they're great!

I don't care about the gluten-free part, though it's great that this product fulfills that requirement for those who need it.  I was interested in the whole grain facet, as I do not care to eat bleached grains that offer nothing but starch and carbohydrate.  Rice krispies are a comfort food from childhood, and I'm glad for this healthier version of it.  If you haven't had the original in a while, you might not notice the difference.  I bought two more boxes of this today!

review/summary: Pretty darn close to the original...
review/text: I really think that these GF Rice Krispies taste very close to original Rice Krispies in flavor and texture.  They're not quite as sweet but the light, crisp crunch is the same, they make the "Snap, Crackle, Pop" sound in the milk, and you can make GF Rice Krispies treats easily with them that taste just the same as you remember.  I honestly don't understand all the 1 star reviews - sure, these don't taste identical to the gluten containing version, but I think they're pretty close, and I can find them for $2.89 a box at my local grocery store which makes them a GF cereal bargain and a kid-friendly one, to boot.  I'm a fan and there are a couple of boxes in my pantry right now.

review/summary: Great, if you don't expect it to taste exactly like the original. Treats are perfect, though!
review/text: As is true with most gluten-free versions of popular products, you will be disappointed if you're expecting gluten-free Rice Krispies to taste and behave exactly like the original.  Snap, Crackle & Pop are in delightfully full force.  Using brown rice instead of the standard white rice is a nice healthier touch but adding sugar to the recipe isn't; these changes do make the cereal taste a little different, though it by no means has become anything resembling a sugary cereal.  Gluten-free Rice Krispies turn to mush in milk much faster -- but is it really a problem to eat it quickly?  I don't think so.<br /><br />I have nothing negative to say about the treats.  Adding the butter and marshmallows makes it exactly like it was when I was a kid, especially if extra marshmallows are added.  They are incredibly moreish, taste and act exactly like the original and do not last very long around my home.  The Kellogg's website also has recipes for peanut butter treats and seasonal Gluten Free Tree Trimmer Treats.  I am loyal to the plain so cannot vouch for them but nice touch, Kellogg's.<br /><br />Rice Krispies Gluten Free are available for the same $3.99 price as regular Rice Krispies.  Bonus points go to local shopping on this one for every supermarket in my area accepting general Kellogg's manufacturers coupons & WIC checks for this gluten-free cereal.

review/summary: Tastes like cardboard
review/text: I was hopeful.  Higher fiber, lower carbs, lower calories, and I like brown rice.  Sadly, it's a bit tough and tastes like cardboard.

review/summary: Tasty and healthy-ish.
review/text: Low calorie, sodium, and sugar.  Relatively delicious if you're someone accustomed to not eating a ton of sugary crap.  This BHT nonsense is overated.  Did you know that BHT and BHA are being used in the study for the treatment and cure of HIV and AIDS?  Yeah, it *may* just be good for you.  Anyways, in low quantities BHT is not known to make you sick and unless you're planning to eat hundreds of boxes of Rice Krispies in one sitting, you probably won't have to worry about BHT killing you.
