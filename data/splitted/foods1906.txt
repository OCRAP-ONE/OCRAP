review/text: I picked up Hodgson Mill's Buckwheat pancake mix at my local grocery, not expecting anything much, but knowing how good buckwheat is for one's health.  Wow, was I surprised to find pancakes or belgian waffles made with this taste great, too!<br /><br />I find that pancake/waffle batter is a wonderful place to hide healthy additions like soy protein powder (add a little water), flax seed, etc.  I use organic coconut oil and add fun items like chocolate chips, banana, or walnuts to the batter for a breakfast that makes me (and my whole family) feel upbeat and energetic for many hours into the day, even if I only have one pancake!<br /><br />Well done, Hodgson Mill!

review/text: This buckwheat pancake mix makes delicious and healthy flapjacks.<br /><br />It also contains no animal products, making it suitable for vegans and strict vegetarians.<br /><br />Hint:  if you use a few heaping spoonfuls of applesauce instead of eggs and soy milk instead of the dairy variety, the result is a pancake that tastes exactly like the standard approach but is healthier and can be enjoyed by veg-heads.  Top off with maple syrup and a little Earth Balance (instead of butter) and your day is off to a great start!

review/text: These work well grilled as sausages in scant oil, roasted over coals or campfire, cut up and put into many recipes. They can be made into good corn dogs too. I think they are the best canned veggie dog with Worthington Super Links in second place. The liquid the sausages are packed in makes good stock for soup or gravy.

review/text: I'm not a vegetarian so I was some what skeptical of all the good reviews for Worthington saucettes but I finally decided to order to try them out.<br /> At first out of the can they appear as greyish hotdogs -not very appealing. After cooking they brown nicely and look more like real sausage links.<br /> The texture and outer skin are nice and very close to real sausage links.In my opinion they taste better than some brands of the real sausage links, a nice soft flavor thats not too over powering or spicy.<br /> Its amazing these are made with no harm to piggys.^^<br /> I'm pleased with my purchase...

review/summary: Yummy meatless veggie treat!
review/text: I've been a vegetarian for about 40 years. I used to love these Saucettes but fell away from eating them because they became so difficult to find. Thank goodness for amazon.com! I just got my 1st subscription shipment today. As soon as I got the box home from the Post Office, I ripped it open & took out all the cans to inspect them. Most cans were very dented, but none were leaking. I opened the worst dented one to see if the product was OK. I tasted a Saucette right out of the can. YUMMY, YUMMY! Just as good as I remembered them. I could not stop myself & ended up eating half that can right there on the spot for lunch. These Saucettes make a real good snack right out of the can & they are also very good sauteed in a pan for breakfast too. I suppose I'll be finishing off that can for dinner because I'm really craving them again right now. I don't know why the cans were so dented up, the shipping box was fine. I am assuming these were all dented up before they were even packaged & wrapped in the plastic. No matter, the product was absolutely fine. I highly recommend these to any vegetarians who are missing the flavor of having that morning sausage. These are quite mild but still have that seasoning similar to a Brown-n-Serve. I even use the broth they come in to make a yummy country gravy over biscuits! Yum, Yum!

review/summary: Excellent Veggie food.... even if you're not Vegetarian.
review/text: My family loves these.  They are literally a dietary staple for my uber-picky 7-year-old (drowned in Ketchup, of course), and my husband prefers them to any form of low-fat meat sausage (such as turkey).  Saucettes are very low fat, high protein, and have a great flavor and texture, that while not exactly "sausage" is a great tasting product all its own. Drain all the liquid and fry/brown the whole can in a about 1/2 tsp. of oil in a non-stick skillet (you MUST do this for best flavor/texture), then put leftovers in the fridge and microwave to reheat.  I love to tuck one into a piece of whole wheat toast and run out the door... tasty and nutritious breakfast.

It might be possible to develop an aversion though...try one bag first in your cup other wise you might hurt yourself!

review/text: This tea has a gentle laxative effect. When I take it in the evening, I spend much of the next day making trips to the toilet, but nothing too urgent. That said, everyone's system is different. I never take laxatives so I can't compare them to the tea. Unfortunately, this chocolate flavor is faint and rather chalky.

review/text: After a long flight, I arrived in Moorea, tired and thirsty.  Weather was very warm and humid.  At the lobby of this 5-star hotel where I was staying, a smiling hotel employee at the front desk handed me a beverage.  One sip of this cold, refreshing, drink and I just had to ask what it was.  It tasted like freshly squeezed lemonade, without the tartness or after-taste of sweetener. She then left and came back with this bottle of Teisseire Lime from France, a product which I was not familiar with.  I insisted on buying an unopened bottle to bring back home.  Upon returning to the USA, I immediately hunted for this product and found it on Amazon.  I promptly order several bottles in Lime, Strawberry, and Grapefruit flavors.  All were delicious, and I will definitely continue buying them.

We love everything about Tillamook products, and have visited their creamery/factory in Oregon a few times.  It's worth the trip from Minnesota, just to get their ice cream cones.  We haven't found any Tillamook jerky in retail stores out here, so we will be ordering more.

review/summary: Oh how I love these!!!!
review/text: Found these at a local 7-11 and fell in love with them immediately. Not quite to consistency of your standard jerky but there is just something about these that make them absolutely delicious. They came very fresh and easy to eat, not dry and chewy. They are just peppered enough and somewhat with a sweet taste as well. I am so glad I was able to find these at Amazon instead of having to go and take a trip to 7-11. I think once you get used to the consistency and not compare it to other jerkys you'll find these to be a tasty treat as well.

review/summary: If you are into eating plastic get this
review/text: I get beef jerky for the guys in my office as bribery for good behavior.  I started out with this jerky and the best thing about it was the large plastic cylindar it comes in...I can use it to store other beef jerky from jack links!<br /><br />The guys in the office (and myself) said the jerky has the feel of a big flat piece of plastic and is overly sweet. You do get a lot but its not exactly a good value given you are choking it down.<br /><br />I got Jack Link's beef jerky for the crew and they all gobbled it down (they ate the stuff starting at 10 AM...animals).  Their feedback was that jack links actually was a piece of meat versus whatever the heck Tillamook was made of.  Take my adviace and stay away from Tillamook.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OFUC8O">Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Sweet & Hot, 3.25-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>

There's a lot in the large plastic jar, so I can imagine this being great for a Scout troop, too.

review/summary: By far my favorite mustard
review/text: They used to carry this at my local supermarket but store was taken over by a chain which eventually dropped this mustard. Every time I go into a new store and pass by any mustards, I check out the shelf for this brand ... to no avail. I've done this futile shopping for several years now. I just loved this mustard. I'm not even that much of a fan of mustard but I really missed this brand on hot dogs and sandwiches. I guess when it comes to mustards there's different strokes for different folks but this was the one for me. Now that I've found it I'm having trouble with that shipping charge but I'll probably cave before too long.

review/summary: Nice Indian Food Substitute!
review/text: Indian food is a guilty pleasure for me, since nobody else in my home likes to eat it.  So I was pleasantly surprised with this particular entree. The sauce has a kick but with rice it is not overbearing.  I don't believe it has coriander or anise, two spices that I cannot stand eating and have noticed in some of the other dishes.  The vegetables and tofu are tender and tasty, but rather scarce in the package, hence one less star. If I were to pour it in a bowl and compare it to the one displayed on the package, the difference in sauce vs. vegetables/tofu would be laughable!  But it tastes deliciously authentic and it definitely satisfies my Indian food fix!!

I have also mixed it with baked fish and even chicken to make it a more hearty stew. The taste is really good with just enough spice to make it interesting, but the heat not overwhelming.<br />Very impressed with this product, the ingredients list looks really good (not a ton of things I can't pronounce or even know if they are food items or not) and for the price, you really can't get a more complete and healthy meal. Now, these aren't low fat, so don't think this is a diet product. But, it is a tasty and interesting quick meal to have on hand.

review/text: This tea is delicious, AND it is good for digestive issues, supposedly weight loss, as well as congestion, cold and flu because it is full of antioxidants and flavonoids.  Here's a quote:<br /><br />"hibiscus tea benefits embrace all the actions that involve antioxidants. Natural flavonoids assist out body in neutralizing negative effects of free radicals, this way slowing down aging processes, protecting us against cancer and improving our general health. Hibiscus tea and infusion are rich in enzymes which slow down chemical processes in our body linked to breaking complex sugars and carbohydrate absorption. Therefore, drinking 1-2 cups of this beverage on a regular basis can stimulate weight loss, and it is one of the most important health benefits of hibiscus tea."<br /><br />But if it didn't taste good, I wouldn't use it.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, "natural," flavored bones and thought.... "SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great.

review/summary: Good for my cats!
review/text: I love my cats. For many years I fed them the cheaper brands of cat food.  It was not until I had a cat diagnosed with heart disease that I found out more information about feline nutrition.  Basically, protein is very important (it's what they would be eating if they were in the wild) and grains can be hard for them to digest.  Since that time, I've tried to do better in making sure they get the proper nutrition to keep them as healthy as possible.<br /><br />Science Diet has a new line of cat food available called Ideal Balance.  It features fresh chicken as the first ingredient, fruits and veggies as secondary ingredients and is free of corn, artificial flavors and preservatives.  It is conveniently available in the Kitten, Adult and Mature Adult varieties.<br /><br />When I gave my cats this dry food, they enthusiastically ate it. This is actually nothing new. They do that with all cat food. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that as the days went by and they continued eating the food, there was less throwing up from one of our cats who apparently has a sensitive stomach.  I have no doubt the switching of brands is what caused her throwing up to lessen.  Although Science Diet does cost more than other brands you can find in the big box stores, the higher price is worth it to be able to give my cats good nutrition.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a bag of Science Diet Ideal Balance Cat Food free via BzzAgent. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."

review/summary: NOT BAD - JUST TOO COSTLY
review/text: First of all - the seaweed salad, following directions, isn't at all bad. However, the serving size is very small. When I made up 2 packs, one for myself and one for my wife, we looked at the quantity of salad in each of our cups, and realized that it was definitely NOT worth $2 for each serving. One suggestion I have is that you add the dressing a little at a time. The first time we made up each cup, we used the entire packet - it was too strong. For our taste, one packet divided between 2 cups was just right. Except for the price, I would have ordered more. When we bought this item, it was $12 for 6 individual servings.

It's not nearly as sweet or tangy as the "real thing"  The sauce tastes mostly of seasame oil to my taste buds  Not bad but not what I am used to.  Texture is surprisingly good after soaking for 15 minutes or so in cold water.  With at little tinkering, I found out that by adding about a teaspoon of sugar, and 2 teaspoons of seasoned rice vinegar the taste becomes surprisingly good as well.<br /><br />Bottom line: I recommed this product if you love japanese seaweed salad, and are willing to add a few ingredients to it.

review/summary: Yummy without the dressing
review/text: I always order seaweed salad in restaurants and like it very much.  But I always thought how much better it would be without that sweetish dressing it comes with these days.  I ordered some frozen, and the dressing was already on it.  Also the frozen stuff came in one big batch that had to be thawed all at once.<br /><br />These are individual salads.  The dressing is separate.  One re-hydrates the seaweed salad part which has seaweed, sesame seeds, agar (from seaweed) and red peppers in it.  It was absolutely delicious without the dressing which comes in a separate packet.  I discarded the dressing.  Why gild the lily?<br /><br />The label says this is two servings.  I call it one scant serving.  The label does not separate the food value (such as calories and fat) of the dressing versus the salad so it is hard to tell the food values.  I would also like to know the iodine content.  Since I don't salt my food, I am inclined to be short of iodine.<br /><br />I will definitely keep buying this which is highly portable - good for camping or the office lunch.  But I will try to find the same thing in bulk.  No need for dressing.

review/text: I love this product. At $2 per serving its cheaper here than at the health food store. It's packed full of vitamins and nutrients and is convenient and lightweight. It tastes great even without the dressing. If I use the dressing I use a pretty small amount, but I do that with lettuce salads too!<br />Be warned if you plan of giving it to children though, it does contain slices of Thai chili peppers, which might be a little spicy for very sensitive mouths.

review/summary: Easy, portable seaweed salad
review/text: I love seaweed salad and was looking for a less expensive way to enjoy it at lunch on workdays when I came across this item. It's just like seaweed salad from a restaurant, but perfectly portable. It is a little expensive for the serving size -- which is definitely not enough to make a meal by itself -- but I figure some of that is due to the convenience factor, and even without them, seaweed salad doesn't generally come cheap. I'm happy with these, though a slightly larger serving size would be nice.

I don't know who else makes oil free salad dressings but I wanted to try.<br /><br />Well, I made a mistake and ordered this which was one of the dressings containing oil. Being curious I opened a bottle and tried a very small amount and though it was wonderful.<br /><br />The only reason for the 4 stars is that it is pricey salad dressing. I also ordered the Spicy Cilantro and Citrus Dressing which is oil & fat free and love the taste and the fact it is oil free.

review/text: I always look for this brand of bulgar above all others, it just seems to cook up and taste the best. Cook as you would rice--one part bulgar, 2 parts water. It cooks as fast as plain white or brown rice, and in my pressure cooker, done in 6 mins flat. Great for adding to soups, eaten as a side dish, or use in a cold summer salad. Anything you'd make with rice, farro, barley, lentils, beans, etc., you can substitute bulgar just as easily. High in fiber too.

review/text: As a marinade, it does exactly what you expect mesquite to do: slightly spicy, smoky, sweet, delicious. Just follow the directions.<br /><br />One of the things I love to do with this is mix a packet or two into a cup or two of plain bread crumbs, dip boneless chicken breasts or thighs into beaten egg and into the breadcrumb/marinade mixture and bake in a baking dish covered with foil (350 oven, about 45-50 minutes).  Easy, moist chicken, wonderful flavor.... did I mention easy? I serve this to company over brown rice and they rave about the perfectly blended flavors.<br /><br />After all, sometimes, grilling requires too much attention, and I'd rather drop a dish in the oven and wait for the timer to go off while I prepare other food or just hang out with my guests.

review/text: I'm a book reviewer, not a foodie. So I read a bunch of reviews and news stories about olive oil. Made me suspicious of most olive oils, being not pure. Then we went to Spain and I talked with some growers and pressers (sic) of olive oil. The name Columela came up more than once. So we bought some. The company said it was a available locally. Wrong. So I have to buy it by Internet. Not my favorite way to acquire foodstuff.  Why? Because it's Great. We are persuaded, for cooking and eating with bread (I bake) this is the best. I use it for everything where good olive oil is called for and recommend it without resservation. I just wish I could buy it off the shelf in Roseville Minnesota.

review/summary: Too Yummy for Their Own Good!
review/text: And way too yummy for my waistline! How come I can't award these things fifteen stars, anyway?<br /><br />Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips are without a doubt, the most delicious cinnamon treats I've ever eaten.  They remind me of the best bite of an apple pie crust, without the apples and the goopy moistness of eating an apple pie out of a bag.  With Stacy's Pita Chips, you open the bag and get this tiny puff of cinnamon aroma and you are compelled to dive in, face first and mouth open.  Sharing is not recommended, but the sharing police aren't going to do anything to you if you give a couple to someone you love dearly.  However, that night you will lie in bed unable to sleep, obsessing about each chip that you gave away, and your stomach will growl accusingly.  Be warned.<br /><br />Happily, now that you have found these chips on Amazon, you will not go broke because of your addiction.  They have a superb price, far better than anything I have found in Boston area supermarkets.  For example, I save over a buck every time I eat a bag of chips from Amazon.  I'm eating several bags a day, and at dollar apiece, I am going to be rich, rich, rich!  (sorry, richness not guaranteed in your area)<br /><br />On a less spectacular note:  a baked treat is not a fat-free treat, and calories are the punishment for yumminess.  The bag claims that a portion is a measly eleven(!) chips!  Eleven!  I've had more than eleven chips while writing this paragraph. That miniscule amount of flavory goodness is packed not only with wonderfulness, but also with 140 calories!  The tiny snack size bag has 1.5 ounces, and is supposed to feed 1.5 people. That also means it has about 17 chips in it, and I'd be licking the inside of the bag, embarrassing myself for all time, and adding 210 calories to my personal fat-retention system.<br /><br />You may wish to purchase and split a case of Stacy's Pita Chips with a friend, so that you can both wear swimwear without embarrassment in the coming season.  Make sure that your friend is there when the friendly delivery person arrives with your chips, or your friendship might be endangered. (Or you might have to buy a second case to split with the friend, but that leaves your waistline in worse shape than it was before)  Better yet, make friends with the delivery person, and split the case with him.<br /><br />Enjoy your tasty treats, and if you have difficulty making friends, the kind you would want to share your Stacy's Pita Chips with, I am a kind and friendly person, and can be trusted to split a case fairly and evenly.

review/text: I bought a case of these and my whole family enjoyed them. Very crunchy, with just the right amount of cinnamon sweetness. Since I bought a case, it took my family of three awhile to work through them, after about a month and a half, I found that the chips had gotten soft and stale. That was disappointing, especially since the expiration date was still a few months away.<br /><br />So, if you eat them fairly fast, I highly recommend this product, otherwise, buy a smaller amount.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: The box arrived damaged - there were actual holes in the cardboard shipping box, with one large enough for me to fit my entire wrist/hand through. Alarmed, I opened the box, and other than a couple of what looked like grease stains on the inside of the box, the individual bags were thankfully intact. A quick phone call to Amazon and they were kind enough to make a generous adjustment, and noted my comments on the packaging, for further investigation. Kudos to Amazon for their usual excellent customer service.<br /><br />The Stacy pita crisps themselves were none the worse for the harrowing journey - they survived deliciously. I've tried several varieties of the Stacy pita crisps, but these are a sweet treat. The cinnamon sugar pita crisps are a sinful pleasure, with the right amount of crunchiness and sweetness. I try to justify this indulgence by telling myself they're baked, not fried. There are studies as to the health benefits of cinnamon, which may or may not be valid, but they are certainly yummy, if not healthy.<br /><br />When I opened the box, it looked like a lot (for one person), but I'm embarrassed to say they didn't last me long enough. The individual portions seem small, but the crunchiness takes time to chew, so it makes them last longer. The Subscribe & Save price was an excellent value over regular retail.

They're worthy of my "OMG, instant love" rating for snacks.  I love cinnamon & sugar anything, and these don't disappoint.<br /><br />My sister had a creative use for these chips one evening when we were over for dinner.  She served tacos for dinner, and for dessert these pita chips were topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Perfect!  It was just like apple pie with vanilla ice cream only the pita chips are better because I don't like apples in my apple pie.  :)<br /><br />If you like cinnamon sugar, chances are you'll like Stacy's pita chips.

The single size is nice because it's easier to do portion control than counting out chips into a plastic baggie.<br /><br />Still on the fence if I would order again, but that's because of calories, not taste.
