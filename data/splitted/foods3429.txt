review/summary: 3 Cases Arrived Safely, 1 Did Not
review/text: After reading all the reviews and comments on the dented cans, I wasn't sure I should order the pumpkin on Amazon. However I took the chance. Amazon is my favorite place to shop.  This is the  pumpkin that I buy at our grocery store.  It is for my 18 yr old cat and it keeps her regular. This is her favorite brand. Also I'm hearing that there is a possibility that canned pumpkin might be hard to find on the shelves after Thanksgiving because of the rains. So I wanted to stock up. I remember a couple of months ago  it was hard to find in some areas.<br /><br />I received the order yesterday and was a little scared to open it up.  But it was fine!! The cans arrived in great condition.  There was a tiny dent on maybe 2 or 3 cans (just like I might find on the grocery shelf). I was very happy with my order.  Maybe it has something to do with the warehouse it is shipping from.  I live in CA and Ontrac delivered it. I've been so impressed with Ontrac. Amazon has been using them alot lately.<br /><br />I went ahead and ordered 2 more cases and hope they arrive in the same condition.  The date on the cans is 6/2012. The price per can on Amazon is $2.36. In our store it is $2.99 and when on sale, maybe $2.50.<br /><br />I received 2 more cases that I ordered and they were in perfect condition.  Now I'm all stocked up in case it is hard to find pumpkin on the shelf next year.<br /><br />12/08/09 UPDATE:  I believe it matters on who is delivering the order.  I ordered one more case. For some reason this case was delivered by UPS (the others were all delivered by Ontrac) and some of the cans were VERY  badly dented and cannot be used. I asked for a refund.  No matter who is delivering these cans, Amazon needs  to put some protective packing around the cans so they don't get dented. I will no longer take a chance and order similar products on Amazon.

review/summary: Great product no dents was a great purchase and value!!!
review/text: Strong positives:<br /><br />Here is my assessment on buying 3 cases of this product as a cook:<br />1. This is a very strong value on an organic product<br />- Nearly 60% to my local Whole Foods<br /><br />2. Organic products don't act or cook like the mass produced brand but the difference is in the organic nature of these items.<br />- Our experience cooking for over 50 people and over 12 pies so far is they all tasted fine and didn't see any issues in consistency.<br /><br />3. Dented cans, 36 cans purchased and no dents.<br /><br />4. Lastly, beyond the value it was organic with a shelf life on our cans into late 2013.  So while I'm sure the cans we have left will be gone by then the reality was this was a great deal at better than 60% off to my local organic store.<br /><br />Great product and value, glad it was an offered program wish there were more organic items on amazon.com.

review/summary: Farmer's Market is clearly packing dented cans and marketing them through Amazon.com
review/text: Like most of the US, our local stores were all out of canned pumpkin and didn't expect any more to be available until after the Fall 2010 harvest.<br /><br />So, I turned to what I thought was a reliable online retailer - Amazon - to fill the gap.<br /><br />I read the other reviews, but not until AFTER I placed the order.  My mistake, I know.<br /><br />I was optimimistic that perhaps I'd be one of the lucky buyers who didn't get any serious dents.  Unfortunately, just like others reported the case came sealed in two boxes.  The inner box was well packed with bubble wrap covering the already sealed case of pumpkin cans.  The cans were dented even in the middle of the sealed case.  They had clearly been packaged this way and not damaged in shipment.  I find it appalling that Farmer's Market is using Amazon.com as a way to sell its dented and damaged product, knowing full well that buyers cannot visually inspect the product prior to purchase.

review/summary: So disappointed in canned pumpkin
review/text: I read the last few reviews indicating no dented cans and hoped for the best.  My box arrived today and I too received badly damaged, dented and unusable cans.  I'm not terribly picky but most cans are dented at the rims/seams and all are badly smashed all over.  This was my last hope for canned pumpkin for my dog.  I do not believe the Amazon packaging is the problem. The cans were already dented prior to being shrink-wrapped.  I do not believe stores would put these cans on their shelves and I would never buys cans with this much damage. I have never been unhappy with an Amazon purchase, but this product was a waste of my time.

review/text: I love pumpkin, my dogs love pumpkin.  I quite often roast my own, but I need back up cans now and again.  Libby's has disappeared from stores.  This stuff is the only brand ANY store is selling.  It tastes like dirt.  It really does.  There is no fresh pumpkiny flavor.  It is also watery, which changes how pie and cake recipes turn up.

review/summary: Good pumpkin, BUT too many heavily dented cans!
review/text: I bought 2 cases (24 cans) of this product from Amazon.com.  Out of the 24 cans, 5 were undented, 10 were badly dented, and 9 were extremely dented with 3 of those being crushed in half.  The crushed cans were in the center of one package of 12.  Each case had 12 cans in it and was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap.  The 2 cases were inside a larger box.  There was no damage to any of the boxes.  Other reviewers of this product have talked about these cans arriving dented in similar fashion to what I experienced but I took a  chance and hoped for the success other reviewers have experienced.  Lady Luck was not on my side.  Fortunately, by googling the product's name I found Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin at another supplier who sent me a case that only had 2 slightly dented cans and 10 perfect cans for the same price plus nominal shipping.  Amazon.com is a good company and I know they'll refund my money for the case of horribly dented cans that I returned.  However, this issue has been going on for some time as evidenced by the reviews.  Where the problem lies, I do not know but I will not buy this product again from Amazon.com until the dented can issue has been resolved.<br /><br />As to the product itself, the pumpkin is delicious.  It's not solid like Libby's pumpkin, but it works well for my recipes.  It has the consistency of baby food and is slightly more yellow than Libby's pumpkin.  There is a recipe on the can for pumpkin pie using condensed sweetened milk.  I prefer Libby's recipe so instead of 14 oz. of condensed sweetened milk, I use 12 oz. of evaporated milk and 1/2 c. of sugar because we like it less sweet.  The product I can recommend and would've given it 5 stars for the pumpkin alone, but the ongoing, horribly dented can issue lost it 4 points.  The dents really are that bad and some are so badly dented that if they can be opened, they may represent a health hazard.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Amazon.com is a great company.  It refunded my money for the badly dented cans.  Today, I also received my second order from another online company and while it had fewer dented cans in it, the badly/severely dented cans were in the middle of the 12-pack case just like they were in the 2 cases I had ordered from Amazon.com.  The problem seems to lie with the manufacturer.  I've emailed  Farmer's Market Foods, Inc., twice but have heard nothing from the company.  I won't be buying this product again.  Over 50% of the 48 cans had bad to severe dents, of which at least 3 were crushed almost in half.  Badly dented cans may be unsafe to use (e.g., botulism, bacteria).  The tops and bottoms may seem fine (unswollen) at first, but if the seal is microscopically breached, it may not be fine months from now.  So, when it comes to this product and the company's continued shipping of badly dented and crushed cans in the middle of the case, all I can say is:  "caveat emptor."

review/summary: every can was dented
review/text: I am SO disappointed.  Even though I read many reviews complaining of dented cans, I took a chance because of the pumpkin shortage & my family's regular use of pumpkin (a "superfood"!)  But I just received the package, which seemed to be packed sufficiently, yet once I opened it up fully, every single can was dented.  Some severely.  Most in ways I can't imagine happened during shipment.  The only thing I can figure is that the manufacturer is using this a way to get rid of damaged cans, because nobody would pick a can up in the store that looked like the cans I received.<br /><br />I have contacted Amazon customer service and I'm sure they will come through for me - I have never had a problem dealing with them.  But beware if you are buying this product.  Maybe the dented cans were just a fluke but all 12...???<br /><br />**update: Amazon customer service was a breeze to deal with and sent me a new case and again, EVERY can was dented.  Some severely.  I won't try again.  Very disappointed.

review/summary: Not as good as Libby's; cans in bad condition
review/text: There have been ongoing problems with dented and leaking cans with this product.  But my dogs HAVE to have it for their digestion, so I ordered a case somewhat reluctantly.<br /><br />In the first shipment I received, the cans were so badly dented that they looked like they had either been dropped from a considerable height or beaten with machetes.  One was actually leaking.  What's worse, the cans around the outside were apparently undamaged and had the damage turned to the INSIDE - and every badly damaged can was on the interior of the package.  That would seem to indicate that they were repacked to hide the damage -- otherwise the worst damage would be on the OUTSIDE.<br /><br />Good news:  Amazon cheerfully and without complaint replaced the bad cans, and while the replacement cans had a few dents they were not severe and nothing was leaking.<br /><br />That said, the pumpkin itself is not as good as Libby's solid pack.  It's very watery, and there are black flecks throughout.  I wouldn't use it for pies, but the dogs don't seem to care and it does them no harm.

The cans arrived boxed tightly within a much larger box...packing care was evident and not a single can was dented. Have used this pumpkin to make the most awesome pumpkin pancakes. Just stir it into pancake mix and add a little water/milk and microwave for a vitamin-packed indulgent treat. After reading articles on the benefits of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene, this makes organic pumpkin a no-brainer...and totally delicious, too!! WINNER WINNER!!

review/summary: Compared to another brand
review/text: I use a lot of pumpkin.  I especially enjoy it mixed in my morning oatmeal and my little dog considers it a real treat.<br /><br />I was leery of purchasing this product because of the some of the negative reviews so after opening my first can of Farmer's Market Organic Canned Pumpkin, I felt obliged to do a review.<br /><br />I am so glad that I ignored the negative reviews.  I happened to have a can of Libby's pumpkin puree (my usual brand) already open so it was easy to do a comparison.  The Farmer's Market pumpkin seemed a little creamier and the color was very similar but perhaps just a shade less bright.  To my palate, it seemed to have a slightly earthier taste, more like sweet potato but when I added cinnamon and sweetener, it was impossible to detect a difference.<br /><br />None of the cans were dented and the expiration date of October 2013 is almost three years in the future.  I am very happy with this purchase and delighted that it is offered on subscribe and save since pumpkin puree is not something all grocery stores routinely stock in the off season.

My Amazon order was in much better shape than the cans I've seen in the stores.  Price is good too.  Locally, I've seen this product priced between $2.39 and $3.69 a can.  And even though the Amazon price is only pennies less a can than my lowest local price, it's incredibly convenient; especially with the free shipping.

review/summary: Great for my dogs' digestion!
review/text: I have tried several brands of canned pumpkin for my dogs (and cat).  My veterinarian recommended it to help them naturally express their anal glands, which saves them a lot of pain and discomfort at the groomers.  (And helps the cat move hair through his system).  Using pumpkin has helped them a lot.  I like this brand because it is not as pricey as those that are sold specifically for pets, and it is a solid consistency (not as loaded with water as some other brands), and it is organic (just makes me feel a bit better), and it is reasonably priced (especially with the 15% discount for setting it up as a subscription item).  And there you have it!

review/text: I have purchased this pumpkin from Amazon to help my cat lose weight and for baking.  The consistency is, well, for lack of better word, inconsistent.<br /><br />Sometimes we received firm canned pumpkin like the kind I grew up baking with, and other times we received a runny, really messy sort I would call puree.  I contacted the company and they said something about having an extraordinarily wet season.  Never did figure out what that had to do with the processing of the pumpkin...<br /><br />I do not know how other organic pumpkins fare or even if there is competition in the line of product.  Some cans were badly damaged in shipping which was a surprise and quite unfortunate.  Amazon's Customer Service was stellar as always and replaced what was damaged.<br /><br />As far as the consistencies go, if I still have the photos I took of the runny stuff, I will post them.  It's quite different from the firmer canned pumpkin!  I would recommend this for buying a lot of (for cats and dogs when it's a really good price), but honestly I don't use this for baking anymore because I never really know what I'll get.

The product is high quality. It is part of the diet I feed to my dogs (home prepared food only mostly raw meat) but I've eaten this pumpkin myself and it is a fine product.

review/text: This canned pumpkin is a great value for organic.  Ive ordered theses twice so far.  I did find it to have a bit more liquid than Libby's so I usually reduce the liquid or oil in my recipes a bit.  I will continue to order these at the right price!

review/summary: Still experiencing some denting issues
review/text: I ordered two cases, which arrived in the same box this morning.  Packaging was in perfect condition.  One case of twelve was also in perfect condition, without a single dent.  However, the other case had 8 out of 12 cans dented, some badly. Since the packaging is clearly not damaged, I would take this to mean that the cans were already dented when they were packed.

review/summary: Delicious, no dented/damaged cans
review/text: I usually eat Libby's canned pumpkin; pumpkin isn't on the Dirty Dozen list [...] so buying organic wasn't a priority for me. But I eat pumpkin year-round and the stores around me were low on canned pumpkin, so I decided to order it.<br /><br />I hadn't actually tasted this particular product before ordering it from Amazon. I was a bit nervous that it would taste bad and I would be stuck with 12 cans.  Luckily, this canned pumpkin is delicious and I think it tastes better than Libby's. I usually eat it mixed with oatmeal or yogurt or in pumpkin smoothies.  Sometimes, I just eat it with some pumpkin pie spice and sweetener.<br /><br />All the cans arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />I ordered this  item on December 17, 2010.

review/text: the product was safe to use but everyone of the cans were dented.  Some moderate but most severly dented.  We were almost afraid to use them.  There was very little packaging in the box with the product.<br />The price was fairly good considering that they were hard to find on the store shelves.

review/text: Okay I read all the reviews before purchasing and debated on buying because all the complaints about dented cans.  My order arrived and I had about 6 dented cans.  I've already used the worst of the dented cans and the pumpkin was fine.  It tasted great.  I highly recommend.  People make a big deal about dented cans but unless they're punctured, it's no big deal.

review/summary: Great Pumpkin, All But Two Cans Dented
review/text: When I ordered this organic pumpkin product, there was a problem with customers receiving dented cans. Amazon/Farmer's Market Foods was assessing the situation to resolve this problem, and the pumpkin was not being sold. When, I assumed, they had finally resolved the dented cans situation, I was able to order.<br /><br />I received the case of pumpkin puree and the box seemed really well packaged, so I was surprised to find all but 2 of the 12 cans DENTED. I'm almost certain the problem is occurring at the manufacturing plant, because the cans in the middle of the case were all dented. Be informed the problem is not resolved, yet.<br /><br />I went ahead and used the pumpkin from a dented can as there was no indication the product was tainted (Push on the top and bottom of the can. If the top or bottom of the can moves in any way or makes a popping sound, the can's seal has been broken and air has made its way inside). The pumpkin tasted fresh and had a very succulent, moist consistency and it is organic. I would definitely recommend this brand of pumpkin IF they resolve their dented can problem, especially since you can't find pumpkin in the grocery stores at this time (due to the destroyed pumpkin crop in the Fall of 2009).

review/summary: Who Knew? Pumpkin Shortage!!?
review/text: I actually feed my cats pumpkin to maintain a healthy digestive system and they love it! Unfortunately there has been a pumpkin shortage in the stores. The only canned pumpkin available was the organic at Amazon. I have never used this before. Although the cats eat it, I was disappointed because it is very "watery". I just wonder if this will impact pumpkin pies at Thanksgiving if we still have a shortage!

review/summary: Pumpkin for Dogs diet shortage - Saved by this product!
review/text: This pumpkin product arrived in good condition and is all that was available after the almost year-long shortage due to Libby pumpkin running out during the 2009 holiday season. My dogs get pumpkin with each meal to help with their digestive system working properly and it works great. Thanks to Farmer's Brand for having enough product to fill our needs. It is more expensive to order online, naturally, but between my 'stop gap' measures of baking squash to serve to my dogs, and alternating between meals with Farmers Brand pumpkin, we will be able to make it through to the next harvest season, where I feel we should purchase our own warehouse full of pumpkin in case the shortage hits us again next year. Thank you Farmers brand and Amazon for helping us through your being prepared to offer your products to us on line. My dogs thank you too... woof!;- )

review/summary: A workable alternative to Libby's pumpkin during their shortage.
review/text: Like a number of other reviewers, we use canned pumpkin as a dietary supplement for our dogs. As a result, we go through a lot of it. We usually use the Libby's brand which is readily available in our grocery store, but due to flooding of last year's crop it has been out of stock for a few months. Luckily the organic growers did not have the same problem. I find this product to be more finely pureed than the Libby's so it seems a bit runnier. However, my dogs love it. The only minor disadvantage is the cost. It is more expensive than the Libby's, plus I'm paying to have it shipped now vs. picking it up at the store.<br /><br />A number of other Amazon customers have complained about receiving badly dented cans. Mine arrived 100% intact. This may be a result of the unconventional courier used. It appeared to be some sort of private delivery service though I paid for the standard service. A man hand delivered the item to my house using what appeared to be his ordinary Chrysler Pacifica minivan. I've never seen an item delivered this way by Amazon or anybody before.

review/summary: Dented Cans!
review/text: I ordered a few days ago and some of my cans arrived dented. Multiple cans were on the outside edge of the box, but only one row (3 cans total with 2 severely dented) was dented. So, I guess packaging could have been a small factor. BUT these cans are amazingly malleable. Simply squeezing the can in my hand caused it to yield. The small area containing air space is very weak. Libby's canned pumpkin, the brand I've used my entire life, does not have this issue.<br /><br />I already cooked with one of the non-dented cans. The color is different than what I'm used to, it's more of a dirty orange-sepia color, and the texture seems a bit thicker, but it tastes fine.<br /><br />My order also had a long expiration date, 2013.<br /><br />(FYI The packaging consisted of a large box containing a smaller box of cans with bags of air to keep it from rattling. There was no damage or excessive wear on the box. )

review/text: We're huge pumpkin lovers in this house, but it's one of the few things I prefer canned versus fresh. This brand is excellent. There is a huge difference between this brand versus Libby's, or any store brand for that matter. Farmer's Market is thicker and has a much stronger pumpkin taste. And to top it off, it's not only organic but now the label says "BPA free lining" (I don't remember seeing that in the past, so maybe it's a new thing for the company?) which is a huge plus.

review/text: When this item arrived, several cans were dented (during shipping I think). I contacted Amazon and they replaced the order. I was pleased with the way they handled my concern, and the replacement arrived very quickly. The pumpkin tastes wonderful and we have used it in several recipes. Organic canned pumpkin at my local grocery store is outrageously priced compared to purchasing this off Amazon. Even better, the shelf life on the cans I received was very generous. Overall we're very pleased with this product and will order more for our pantry when our stock runs low.

review/summary: Great Pumpkin Feast
review/text: I ordered this recently when it when I noticed the price dropped to $1.23 a can on Subscribe and Save.  I'd hesitated ordering in the past because of the issues with dented cans in some earlier reviews but couldn't resist trying it at that price.  I was pleasantly surprised to get a case of perfect cans that were packed in a reinforced box. The expiration date is 2014 which makes them fresh. I wish I'd ordered more!<br /><br />The consistency of the pumpkin itself has also been good, not watery.  I've purchased this brand at my local market and never had an issue.  This is not a Puree like Libby's Pure Pumpkin, it's more dense, a firmer molded pumpkin.  It has about 10 more calories per serving than Libby's and has higher nutritional stats in vitamin content.  I happen to like both consistencies but prefer organic given I use it almost daily in one form or another. It works as a healthy replacement (along with unsweetened applesauce) in baking muffins, scones, cakes, pancakes, etc. I freeze it into 4 oz sized cubes and use it for Pumpkin Spice smoothies (delicious!). It's great in soups and some chili recipes too. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Great price!
review/text: I love to make pumpkin muffins and bread. I first ordered this product over a year ago when pumpkin was hard to find in the store. Although I like to use natural/organic products, pumpkin is not necessarily one of those things that you need to have organic (due to the thick rind). However, the price of this is impossible to pass up - with S&S, the per can price is cheaper than the local store generic! I didn't think there was much of a difference in taste, until recently I made my muffins with another "name brand" pumpkin-my muffins were just OK, certainly not as yummy as usual. The pumpkin was the only difference. So here I am ordering more! Unless the price shoots up dramatically, I won't use anything else.<br /><br />I didn't realize the dented can thing was a widespread issue. If I remember correctly, I do think some of my cans in my first order were dented, but not badly enough to make them unusable (obviously - we've eaten them all with delicious results and no ill effects LOL!)<br /><br />UPDATE: This latest order arrived in perfect shape in a well reinforced box - no dents or dings anywhere!

I do not buy dented cans in the grocery store, and I was not at all happy to receive an entire case of dented cans.  The packaging was fine, so the cans had to be dented before they were packed.  I am rethinking Amazon's subscription service for food items.  There is no savings if the product is virtually unusable.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the actual product because of the condition the cans arrived in.

review/text: I home cook for my dogs, including plenty of fiber-containing veggies, brown rice, barley, etc., but one little guy has "poop issues" and literally cries out in pain.  Just breaks my heart.  So I started adding pumpkin to their doggie stew to make things a little softer and easier to pass (was that too much information), and that really helps.  Unfortunately, canned pumpkin is only available in my area around Thanksgiving and Christmas.  What?  Don't people eat pumpkin other times?  Not really expecting to find it, I decided to check Amazon and was delighted to find this product available and on "autoship" no less! A little worried about getting a bunch of crumpled cans, but really needed it, so placed an order, and thankfully only one can had a tiny dent; I've seen worse on the store shelves.  Not a pumpkin fan myself, but I did take a taste, and the flavor and texture is much better than what I usually get in the store (so maybe I'll become a fan after all), and the furkids love, love, love it! Whew, what a relief!

review/summary: Good product, nicer than the big name brand
review/text: Good product, nicer than the big name brand we had been buying. Better flavor and texture than Libby's. The price is great; I set up the subscribe and save option for delivery every couple of months so I can have pumpkin year round. Why do I use so much pumpkin? In addition to making delicious soup and baked goods, it is a great food suppliment for my dog. It helps keep his system moving right along, if you get my drift. It also works for cats. Most dogs and cat love pumpkin almost as much as I do.

I have not been able to find it for several years, and finally got smart enough to look on Amazon. It has probably been 10 years since I smelled White Worcestershire Sauce when cooking the chicken for the sauce. Nothing else smells like that. Thank you Amazon for making this available. I thought they just didn't make it anymore.

review/summary: Contains Hydrogenated oil...very disappointed.
review/text: I never would have guessed that a candy like this would contain any fat at all...much less in the form hydrogenated oil? This product offered no ingredient list, so I took a gamble and this time, I lost.  I don't buy anything with trans fat for my family. While hydrogenated oils are not technically trans fat, they are still chemically altered fat which makes them more dangerous than regular fats.  This is the same stuff that makes most peanut butters so unhealthy.  I don't expect candy to be healthy by any means, but this is something I would not have bought if I had seen the label.

review/summary: Was wonderful - then ???
review/text: I'm not sure if this box of this product was kept on the shelf too long, or if it went through a drastic temperature change while in transit, but there is something wrong with these cans of food.  Both cats love the trout feast, but neither would eat even one can from this particular package.  The expiration date was good, there's no harsh smell (well at least not to me), so I cannot understand it.  To insure the cats weren't just being finicky, I bought some Fancy Feast trout feast cans from the local supermart for them and they gobbled those up, as usual.  So, I'm very disappointed with this purchase and will probably not buy the trout feast through Amazon again.

review/text: What can I say about cat food?  Well, my 19 year old Tabby will only eat this flavor.  Trout.  Has to be trout. One can every day. Nothing else will do. At this age, she can have whatever she wants!  So that makes finding this item a top priority!  I used to get this at a local PetSmart, but this flavor is hard to find in stock and it's not at the grocery stores.  I love the convenience of the subscription service, the discount and free shipping.  No more worrying about running out to PetSmart and then finding they are sold out. I never guessed I would find this at Amazon, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Sign up for the subscription, get a sweet discount and free shipping and your cat food hassles will be a worry of the past!

This is a great one. It sneaks right past those little noses that think they need more expensive priced fare. So, get a treat for the kitties at a good price! Send an extra case to your favorite Kitty charity once a month too. They are more than appreciate to recieve it.

I think any cat would like this trout--it does not smell too stinky, and seems to be in a type of gravy so that my kitty has a nice bath after eating it, appearing to be very satified.  What's not to like about that?  Happy cat, happy human.

Great food, high nutritional value, doesn't smell like a fishing pier either.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Instantly gets my dog to eat his food!
review/text: My dog (GSD - 2 years) is an extremely picky eater.  He likes the TOTW DRY dog food, but he only eats it when he feels like it.  Sometimes he will only eat every other day.  I started adding TOTW CANNED dog food (the same kind as the dry) to his kibble and he LOVES it.  Instead of just sniffing the food and walking away, he instantly eats it as soon as I put the bowl down.  I have read that canned dog food is much better than the dry kibble because there is less chemicals and although a meal consisting of only canned food could be pretty pretty expensive with a big dog like mine, adding the canned food into his dry allows him to get the benefits of the canned food, makes him eat more consistently, and even ends up saving you money.  Great product.

review/text: These dates would not have been BOUGHT by residents in the Middle East.  They were small.  Most had the consistency of the rawhide leather chew toys we give our dogs.  Many pits remain, and since these are so old, hard. and stale, they must be soaked in hot liquid for a while to use for baking.  Because there are so many pits and that nubby end thing, one must dissect and snip with scissors every single date into baking-size pieces.  Awful!!  I bet the Bergin Nut Company was chuckling when I ordered so many of their awful dates.  Yuck!!

review/text: I have been looking for REAL maple candy for years now.  Not the "creamy" kind that is found everywhere, but the type that has been cooked down so long that the sugar crystals truly harden.  I was hoping that was what I would find from Butternut Mountain Farms after reading some of the reviews, and boy oh boy, was I right!  This is not stale candy as some reviewers claim, but candy cooked to perfection!  I just finished an entire leaf and I am so happy that I could dance the jig!  Thank you Butternut Mountain Farms!

review/text: I started drinking white chocolate mochas at Starbucks, but at almost $5 a cup, it was too rich for me.  So, I decided to try this product after reading some reviews, and I'm glad that I did!  It tastes almost exactly the same to me as what I was buying at Starbucks when I put it into coffee, but I've found that my favorite mix is to simply add it to cold milk.  I think that it has a wonderful flavor that way, and I prefer it cold instead of hot.<br /><br />As some others have mentioned - if you are looking for a cocoa flavor, this isn't a good choice.  If you know that you like white chocolate and mocha, then I highly recommend giving this product a try.

review/summary: How is Ghirardelli's white chocolate mocha? Yummers!
review/text: I love me a good white mocha, but at 4 bucks a pop at the cafe and goodness knows how many calories -- its an occational treat.  I am really trying to stay out of Starbucks to save money; enter this very creamy and delicious mix from Ghirardelli.  It is such an inexpensive way to enjoy a white mocha!<br /><br />Ten reasons why this mix rocks:<br />1.  It contains no saturated fat or trans fats<br />2.  Each serving of mix has only 100 calories<br />3.  It contains the coffee and is good on its own, but I add powdered espresso or cold brew for AM kickstart<br />4.  I really like being able to control the milk fat content, it tastes really fresh and not like fake creamer<br />5.  It is good hot or cold<br />6.  This mix is ideal for keeping in your office<br />7.  It contains regular sugar and not high-fructose corn syrup<br />8.  One can lasts me four work weeks, but I don't have one everyday<br />9.  It is good to take camping/backpacking for a yummy hot pick-me-up while "roughing it"<br />10.It is awesome with a shot of dark rum, khalua or other suited boozy add in -- instant winter lifter ;)<br /><br />ECONOMY: At 19 servings a can for $4 (21 cents/serving) + milk (25 cents/cup), each white mocha is less than 50 cents!<br /><br />EASE OF USE: It mixes instantly in hot liquid.  If making an iced drink, stir the powder into a small amount of hot liquid before adding the cold milk and ice or you will have the movie DUNE on top of your iced drink.<br /><br />TASTE: To me it tastes very much of white chocolate, it may be just flavoring but it really works.  Actual white chocolate doesn't have any cocoa in it, just the cocoa butter, so I didn't expect any chocolate in the ingredients list and was not disappointed to see it missing.  If this had actual chocolate in it, it would be a black & white (or tuxedo) mocha mix.  It is important to read all the details and ingredients of a product before ordering to avoid disappointment over assumptions.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Scrumptious and thrifty

review/summary: Tastes wonderful. Very smooth
review/text: This is the best white mocha mix I've ever had. It is perfectly smooth once mixed well, and doesn't separate as the drink cools like many other chocolate mixes. The flavor and consistency are both perfect. Ghiradelli gets the job done.<br /><br />Also is really good in milk shakes!<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Just like the coffee shops use.
review/text: This stuff is great!  I used to work at a coffee shop and this is what we would use for white mochas and white hot chocolates.  Ghiradelli by far has the best white hot chocolate mix out there.

review/summary: Not comparable to Starbucks
review/text: From reading other reviews, this white mocha mix seemed to be good if you like Starbucks white chocolate mocha. However, I did not like it at all. It does not taste anything remotely similar to Starbucks white chocolate mocha. As another reviewer pointed out, it is pure sugar. It does not have a chocolate flavor or a mocha flavor. I can't really describe the taste, but it basically tastes like you are drinking sweet milk with a subtle hint of chocolate.

review/text: This is a fantastic drink for winding down after a hectic day or just celebrating the fact that things went well.  I often have to find alternatives to chocolate and this white chocolate drink hits the spot!  My containers arrived quickly and sturdily wrapped in plastic to prevent any damage.  Thanks to the care in getting this to me.  I shall show my appreciation by thoroughly enjoying the product!

review/summary: Skip the coffee bar and not feel deprived!
review/text: If you're a fan of white mocha drinks that break your budget at coffee bars, this is a purchase you must make!<br /><br />All the flavor and consistency that you'd expect is here, and you can make it yourself and save a fortune. I can't swear to it, but I'm willing to bet that this is exactly the same stuff they are selling at such inflated prices.<br /><br />Amazingly good and a wonderful value!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5W2M">Ghirardelli Chocolate Hot Beverage Mix, White Mocha, 19-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)</a><br />This is absolutely fantastic. It is an instant hot chocolate and coffee drink. You can mix it as strong as you like.It is good for adding flavor to a weak coffee some wimp has brewed. It has the coffee affect with the hot chocolate taste. It warms you up for hours. Its the perfect winter treat. It has a lot of calories, but gives you energy to move. So it probably helps you burn more calories than you consume.

review/summary: Absolutely decadent
review/text: I did not expect to like this (don't know what possessed me to buy it in the first place) but after preparing it for the first time, I realized it is absolutely amazing. It is even better when made using the "Back to Basics Coco-Latte" machine, because it creates a nice frothy top.<br /><br />It is a little sweeter than I usually like my coffee, but I think of it more as a dessert beverage or a special treat, instead of my morning coffee, and it is perfect for that.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to anyone who likes White Mochas, if they like them a little sweet. If you are expecting it to be exactly like a White Chocolate Mocha from that ubiquitous chain of coffee shops, you may be disappointed. But if you are looking for a delicious beverage to enjoy after dinner or on a cold afternoon, then you will love this.

review/summary: Great Hot Chocolate
review/text: This Hot Chocolate is the Best.  I have used Girardelli on and off for 50 years; but this is now the best ever.  I have made it up for many people, and all have really enjoyed it and have to have it.  I make with 3 heaping tablespoons of the Chocolate powder and 1/3 teaspoon of instant esspresso, dissolve with boiling water 2-3 oz. then fill cup with milk.  Heat in microwave, then drink.  Once or twice a day is requested by all present.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I found this little gem at CostPlus World Market & jumped on it. As one of those people that spend $5 at the coffee shop 3/week (& sometimes my friend's too!) I just had to have it.<br />I was pleasantly surprised. No it's not the exact same, but that's okay. It's close enough & I feel like I'm getting that indulgence. I picked up some soy milk that I heat in the microwave & some peppermint extract that I intended to make my own simple syrup with but haven't gotten that far. I just put in a little to each cup. I love it and fully intend to buy more when I'm out.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I really wanted to like this mix, but I simply can't.  Naming it "White Mocha" and even featuring a chunk of white chocolate on the package is simply preposterous, considering it neither contains nor tastes like chocolate.  Yes, I did know beforehand that it did not contain cocoa, but I still hoped for a tasty beverage mix that somehow would pull off a similar rich flavor.  But rich this stuff certainly is not; rather, it produces a bland drink that is anything but reminiscent of white hot chocolate, completely failing to produce the feel-good sensation of warm cocoa.  The mocha taste is somewhat present, but hardly enjoyable.  Overall very disappointing, especially for the price and coming from a brand like Ghirardelli.

review/summary: One of the best hot chocolate mixes out there!
review/text: I have been using this hot chocolate mix since Christmas. I also bought and used Godiva's hot chocolate mix.<br />I have a preference for White Mocha, and probably this is why I found Ghirardelli better than Godiva's hot chocolate.<br />For the best hot chocolate drink, I would definitely use both Ghirardelli and Godiva together.
