review/summary: Crackers, yes; but animals, eh?...
review/text: My fiance and I received these from his mom.  Awesome present!  Good for snacking on the couch at home, or for taking along with you to school, work, etc.  They taste great, not too sweet, not too bland.  They are all natural.<br /><br />We have spent way too much time though, trying to figure out what animals these crackers are supposed to be! They are definitely not the animal crackers of our youth (1980's).  Perhaps barnyard animals.<br />There are 1, maybe 2 cats; 1 horse, something with three legs, and 1 that is either a tall goat or a short giraffe. no monkeys though.

review/summary: Glorified Instant Coffee
review/text: I picked up a box of Grove Square "single cup" coffee (medium roast) at Wal-Mart. I should have shaken the box and compared it to another brand and maybe I would have caught on before I left the store. At home when I took one of the cups out to put in my Keurig machine I shook the cup and was alarmed at the noise. Regular K-Cups don't make that much of a noise. I brewed one to test it and the coffee was just so-so.<br /><br />After the K-Cup cooled down, I took a knife and removed the foil top. There was nothing there. At all. Just an empty cup. In other K-Cups there is a filter and the coffee grinds are left in the in the filter. Since there was no filter, no coffee grinds left in the cup, and none in my cup of coffee, then the Grove Square "single cup" coffee is glorified instant coffee.<br /><br />I was not impressed. They are being returned to Wal-Mart.

review/summary: Not Great
review/text: I purchased these K-cups on sale recently on Amazon.  Unfortunately there weren't any product reviews available yet, so I took a risk.  I am fairly certain these cups contain instant coffee.  I think that for a few reasons 1) if you shake these cups they have a distinctly different sound than K-cups of other types that I have.  It's as though the contents are dehydrated and take up significantly less space in the cup than the others; 2) The coffee comes out of the machine initially as dark sludge, then as almost clear water.  Obviously these extremes mix together in the mug; and 3) the flavor reminds me a lot of instant coffee.  Not undrinkable, but not something I would buy again, even if it were on sale.

I hope others won't make the same mistake we did.  We love Amazon, but the return policy on products like this is really disappointing.  I'm very disappointed that Amazon would even carry this.  As other reviews have said, this is, at best, instant coffee in a K-cup.  It sounds like an infant rattle when you pick it up.  Our first cup came out like water that was slightly discolored.

review/text: Be aware if you buy this that it is INSTANT COFFEE. I purchased this at WalMart because the price was so much better than regular K-cups. I brought it home and tried it - awful coffee when you are expecting a cup of fresh brewed coffee.  I contacted Grove Square Customer service to c/o what appears to be deception but got no response. I also contacted Keurig and they did reply saying they were aware of the product and that Keurig was in "talks" with Grove Square about this since Grove Square apparently is not authorized to sell this coffee as a Kcup coffee and the coffee was NOT recommended by Keurig.  I feel if you pay >100$$ for a brewer it isn't to brew instant coffee. I too, like one other reviewer, removed the top after "brewing" my cup of coffee and found absolutely nothing but coffee colored water.  What an absolute disappointment this is.

The cups were only 1/4 filled with grinds that you can shake like noise makers (versus the packed, quiet, REAL coffee k-cups).

review/summary: My Ideal Coffee
review/text: Review of Grove Square Medium Roast K-Cups:<br /><br />Yes, this is instant coffee. No, they don't make that abundantly clear. Here's why I like it anyway:<br /><br />1) I'm not a coffee aficionado, so subtleties in flavor are lost on me, and a brutally strong (I guess you coffee fans call that "robust"?) coffee is off-putting. I just want two simple, basic cups of caffeine, er, coffee every morning.<br /><br />2) On the same note, I don't care to pay a lot of money for my basic daily coffee. This product is priced tolerably enough.<br /><br />3) This instant coffee tastes far better than the kind that comes loose in a jar. That stuff is awful. Some reviews have said this is the same; I disagree.<br /><br />4) When my Keurig produces a "short cup" (doesn't use enough water in the brew cycle), it doesn't work to "re-brew" a k-cup of actual coffee grounds, but it works fine with this product. No wasted k-cups. I've also found that short-cupping happens far less often with this product. My hypothesis is that the brew process for this requires/creates less pressure in the cup than that of "real" coffee, so it's easier on the machine. Yes, the machine should be capable of performing as promised, but that's another review.<br /><br />Bottom line: This product is currently my ideal coffee.

review/text: Frankly I'm shocked to see such an inferior product offered for sale on Amazon! Like another reviewer here I spotted this brand in Wal-Mart. It's much cheaper than the usual K-cups, and there's a reason. Look at the packaging carefully; you won't find the official Keurig logo anywhere since this company doesn't use the patented K-cup design... in fact there's no filter in the K-cup at all, just INSTANT coffee. It tatses like instant coffee too. You might as well buy freeze dried granules, pour a spoon in your cup and run your brewer with no K-cup in the basket for hot water. Stick with official K-cup brands OR use a My K-cup with REAL coffee instead.

review/summary: Don't be fooled into believing this is like your average K-cup
review/text: I decided to save a few dollars at the grocery store and try these off-brand K-cups.  The first thing I noticed was that the cup felt like it had a fourth of the amount of coffee in it as a regular K-cup.  The brewed coffee was very weak, and the flavor was poor.  It wasn't until my husband tried it and told me that it was obviously instant that I realized why it was so cheap.  I had thrown the box away, so I can't couldn't check it, but I definitely do not remember it saying anything about being instant.  If it does say it on the box, it isn't obvious.<br /><br />I feel the packaging is a bit deceptive.  It should clearly state that this is INSTANT coffee.  I don't plan on buying this product again.

review/summary: Hey! This is instant, and costs too much for what it is.
review/text: I picked this up right away when I noticed it was cheaper than anything else. I mostly load my own freshly ground stuff in that Kuerig cartridge or the Eco-cup. The K-cup coffee they sell in the stores sits there for weeks or months (check the date in the square on the bottom and always buy freshest) and it loses a lot of flavor.  I use the K-cup coffee for emergencies, until I get some fresh roasted beans.<br /><br />So, grading on the curve, this stuff is on par with some of the staler K-cups I've had. I came at it with an open mind, only noticing for sure it was instant when I took the cup out of the maker after brewing and noticed it was strangely light. I peeled back the top, and... Nothing! It took my slow brain a minute to figure it out: coffee crystals! As good as Starbucks instant, I think (faint praise).<br /><br />But they don't tell you it is instant. Shame on them for that.  I won't be buying this again.<br /><br />Update, September. Apologies... they DO tell you it's instant, if you are good at reading fine print. I have dropped my rating from 3 stars to 1 because the coffee is not really that good. In fact, I threw it away. Does not make sense economically, even if you like instant coffee.

review/text: This "microground coffee" is glorified instant coffee and tastes worse than any instant coffee I have ever had. Real Kcups have coffee grounds left in them after brewing, these end up empty If I wanted instant coffee I could have gotten hundreds more cups for the price I paid for these. The company should hang their head in shame.. so deceiving. I am awaiting a response to the complaint I wrote to the manufacturer!

review/summary: This is the worst coffee ever!
review/text: I found this coffee on sale at a drugstore for a very low price, and thought I would give it a try. Big mistake! It's INSTANT COFFEE. I took one sip, and poured the rest down the drain cause it tasted awful. I looked at the box, and it doesn't state anywhere that it's instant. It does however, say "soluble and microground Arabica & Robusta Coffee" in micro print. How many people study the label that thoroughly? Extremely deceptive packaging! If I could give it 0 stars, I would!<br /><br />I give Amazon five stars for making it clear that this coffee is instant.

review/text: The "K-cups" have a bit of instant coffe in them, no filter, no coffee grounds.  If you watch the stream of liquid coming out when these "brew" you'll notice a dark stream coming out for a second when the coffee powder dissolves and then the rest is water.  The coffee is terrible and the worst part is they cost as much as the real K-cups.<br /><br />Do no buy these, they are a complete waste.  Save yourself a ton of money and go buy some Folgers if you just want instant coffee.

review/summary: Vile enough for your unwanted dinner guests
review/text: When I was in high school, we had to write theater criticism (don't ask). We were not permitted to write wholly negative reviews, there had be some "balance". This habit has stayed with me. In an effort to say  something positive thing about this product I can say the text on the box about a "coffee lovers charter" is so ridiculous it made me laugh, and, this coffee is so vile that it is helping me tackle my excessive coffee drinking.  This week I have approached the Keurig several times only to find that I can't face this coffee. This could also be used to drive people away from your house, unwanted guests, people that just come over to use the Keurig etc...<br /><br />Somehow I missed the fact that these contain instant coffee when I was buying them from Amazon.... maybe I was in a hurry, maybe it isn't indicated clearly enough, I don't know. I have drunk some instant coffee in my time and it's not all terrible, especially some of the European stuff. However, these Grove Square K-cups make the most terrible coffee. It is thin, watery, and smells nasty and tastes revolting. I may have to actually read the instructions for my Keurig to figure out how best to clean it in order to remove the residue of this stuff. Yuck.

review/text: Seriously--this is unlike any K-Cup you have ever tried. There are no coffee grounds, and no filter in this K-cup. In very fine print on the box it states, "Soluble and Microground Arabica Coffee." In other words, instant. Tastes like it too. Even if I wanted this kind of low-quality coffee I certainly would NOT buy it in a K-Cup.

review/summary: I tried so hard to like this stuff but...
review/text: I just couldn't bring myself to drink another cup.  I picked up an 18 count box of Grove Square medium roast at my local Wal-Mart for around $7.98.  I should have paid more attention to the instant coffee notes on the box and taken that as a warning.  They really sold me on the k-cup for the dollar ratio and I was a sucker for it.  I like instant coffee, in fact, I am one of the few people who has actually written a review for Nescaf&eacute; Cl&aacute;sico, an instant coffee of which I have been a fan for many years but this...coffee, I guess you can call it, is awful.  I try to approach each different k-cup with an open mind and open palate but maybe I was just spoiled from all of the french, espresso roast and Nantucket blend that I have been consuming over the last few months but seriously, this coffee would scare a new Keurig customer away from our machines (no, I don't work for Keurig, but our brewer is loved in our home more than our cat at times).  The coffee has a flat, watery taste to it with almost no roast taste to it, even though it is supposedly "medium roast", but instead leaves a lingering bitter taste on the back end, kinda like that last swallow of cold coffee that has been sitting around for an hour or so.  I would compare the flavor of this instant k-cup to that of Caf&eacute; Oro brand instant coffee.  I might drink this if I have no other k-cups around the house but I may even, God forgive me for saying this, add a flavored creamer to it just to get my money's worth out of it.  That or I may just return it.  This is a sad day for coffee lovers and k-cup fans everywhere.

review/text: Bought some Grove Square Medium Roast.  Got it home, and when I opened it I found out it was "Instant" freeze dried in a K-Cup.  K-Cups feature real coffee grounds, the idea is to make it fresh brewed.  This is an insult on how some run-of-the-mill company can maximize profits.  It's much cheaper to buy your favorite "instant" and run the Keurig without a cup for the hot water only, instead of buying these pre-packaged instant cups. I won't be taken again, that's for sure! I'm sticking to Name Brands that feature real coffee!

review/text: Hoped that these cheaper k-cups would be tasty.  Not so much.  Fortunately, I use a glass measuring cup instead of a coffee mug.  I was able to see the sludge and not pour it into my travel mug.  I am a light weight coffee drinker (aka a lot of coffee creamer involved), so I try to use a k-cup twice.  There was no way I could get "two" servings out of one of these k-cups.  The second attempt turned into water.

review/text: I'm not a coffee snob. I just like a good cuppa joe in the morning, something medium roast, smooth, with good flavor. No blueberry this or vanilla that. My usual brew is either Timothys Italian Blend or Kona Blend and Green Mountain Nantucket Blend. I saw this Grove Square coffee at a local grocery so I thought I would pick up a box to try. I didn't realize that it is just instant coffee packaged in a K-cup. It starts out brewing very thick for the first few seconds and then lightens up to plain hot water. The K-cup comes out empty when you remove it from the brewer. I thought the taste was lousy and there was a slightly gritty sludge at the bottom of the cup. I took the box back to the store and suggested they not stock it.<br /><br />The front of the box does state that it is "Naturally Roasted Soluble and Microground" coffee beans. It also states that in the descriptions here at Amazon at least on the ones that I looked at. If you like instant coffee, you would do better with Starbucks Via than this stuff.

At any rate, in our machine (Model B40), the instant coffee crystals clog up the hole that is punctured in the bottom of the cup, resulting in only about 2 oz. of liquid (I won't say it's exactly coffee) being dispensed.  Going to ask Amazon for a refund.

review/summary: Great coffee if you know your drinking instant
review/text: I believe this is instant coffee.  When your coffee is done brewing the K-cup is empty. There are no coffee grounds as in other brands.  It didn't taste as good as regular coffee but if you think of it as instant coffee (as I think it is) then it's not bad.

review/summary: Disappointed....
review/text: I know I ordered medium roast;  but for me, the coffee was too bland. I  still use it (cause it is such a waste) but on espresso setting. It tastes great on that setting. And there were two containers that didnt have any granules in them (they were empty)....Plus, the one thing I really don't like is when I ordered (I did it on subscribe and save) the the price was really very good. But today, I checked the price (it's still on my subscription) and the price was jacked up that its kinda senseless to even order it on subscribe and save. I'm cancelling the subscription just like the gloria Jean hazelnut I had before....cause the price that they entice you with to go into subsctribe and save after the first order....prices go way up!!!! Not good....

review/summary: Not as good as I had hoped
review/text: While the taste of the coffee itself is acceptable for the most part, several of the cups did not work properly and I was unable to get them to brew.  I also found it interesting that on the ones that DID work...when the water went through it in the brewer, initially the stream of coffee was very, very dark and then it turned to water.  Made it seem like there was something similiar to instant coffee in there...<br /><br />Anyway, while it seemed a good price initially, I won't be purchasing this brand again.

I'll send it to you....<br /><br />Bottom line, it has opened my eyes to NOT think that ordering anything online is going to be cheaper than buying locally....from here on, will always exhaust all local vendors for anything I want before resorting to online....that's a reversal from the way I used to shop....suffice it to say, I will NEVER order frog legs from you folks again, & short of the great deal you offer on Colman's Mustard, will check locally on everything from here on....thanks for the lesson learned!  Have a Nice day....tfg

review/summary: redundancy
review/text: Can't we just say 48 frog legs instead of "24 pair"?  Do the left and right legs taste differently?  I was a connoisseur of frog legs for several years until one fateful day at an authentic Chinese restaurant.  I was delighted to see a placard for frogs' legs on the buffet sneeze shield until I discovered that the legs were prepared attached at the crotch.  Being a fan of the dish, I placed several on my plate and returned to my table.  I immediately used my knife to separate the legs and attempted to enjoy my entree.  The legs were prepared exquisitely; however, I could not enjoy them as I kept imagining going down on an amphibian.  Since that day in 1999, I have forsaken all exotic foods of the oriental variety.  This includes:<br /><br />1. frogs-legs attached at the crotch<br />2. fish served with head and eyeballs displayed<br />3. whole baby octopi<br />4. anything with tentacles<br />5. shrimp with heads<br />6. deviled eggs<br />7. jello

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I'm surprised how much it tastes like coffee. To be completely accurate, it tastes like a watered down coffee (like the kind you get at hotels) with hazelnut flavor -- and a *very slight* earthy undertone. If someone gave me a sip and didn't tell me what it was, I'd think it were coffee, let's put it that way.<br /><br />There's not all that much root per teabag though, and since I like strong coffee I only use 6 oz of water per bag and steep it covered for 15 mins. Then with some cream and sugar it's quite good.<br /><br />As for the liver tonic claim, well dandelion stimulates bile flow and supposedly helps clear out some stuff gunking up the liver. I don't know about that yet, but so far I haven't noticed any ill effects from drinking this. I feel fine, if not outright good after drinking a cup, but that's as far as I can confirm the effects.<br /><br />And with even decaf coffee containing 5-15 mg caffeine per serving, this stuff being completely caffeine free is a blessing for those of us who go bananas and light public property on fire when we get the slightest bit of caffeine. Anyone who needs a coffee substitute, do give this a try.

review/summary: Really Gross
review/text: I've read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as "coffee tasting" or with "roasted flavors," but to be very truthful, it tastes just the way I could imagine second hand smoke would. It's very very strong, requires 15 minutes to steep, and is not for the faint hearted. I've heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product, but I was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits. Good luck to those who care to brave this "roasted" flavor.

review/summary: GOOD FOR YOU, BUT WORST TASTING TEA EEEVVVEEERRR
review/text: As an avid tea drinker of all corners of the earth, I have had hundreds of teas, and everything from this company as well. I read about this tea as a very powerful health herb but all the reviews said it tastes bad. What do I care? I'd rather be healthy. I never take sugar in my tea either. If you've read this far you are waiting for me to say how bad it was. You can't imagine how bad it is. Without exaggeration I would describe the flavor as a very bitter tasting dirt. Yes, as a 32 year old with children I know what dirt tastes like and this tastes like dirt but with a super bitter taste that makes it hard to drink. My recommendation is to let it steep for a shorter amount of time as to not make a rich bold tea. As you know, the longer it steeps the bolder the tea becomes. Yea, don't do that with this. Four stars because it is apparently very good for you and I thank the company for bringing it to us regardless of the taste of death when other tea companies are using Artificial ingredients to make their teas taste better.

I too only use formula when I'm on the go or need to supplement if I don't have enough breast milk, so the can is a waste since I won't finish it in a month. The packets are so convenient. I carry a bottle or two of 4oz water and a couple of packets in my purse at all times for emergencies.<br /><br />Only 4 out of 5 stars because you can only make 4 oz or 8 oz.  So if your baby is currently eating more than 4oz but less than 8oz you either hope he is satisfied with 4oz or make 8oz and waste some.

review/summary: Best tomato sauce I've ever found in a jar
review/text: This sauce comes in a rather small jar. Compare the size to what is in your pantry before you buy! One jar is "5 servings"--more like 3-4 servings of pasta for our family. I'd guess the average oversized restaurant bowl of pasta uses almost as much as you find in one of these small jars.<br /><br />It is also quite expensive per jar. I buy this at my local Whole Foods for about 30% less than the current Amazon merchant price I see here, and it is still pricier than many "regular sized" (bigger) jars on the Whole Foods shelf.<br /><br />That being said, I buy this sauce and no other when I find it in stock at my grocery store. It really is tastier than any other jarred sauce I've ever tried. I think it captures that delicious taste difference between a fresh-picked tomato from one's own yard as opposed to a store-bought fruit. Yes, it is that much better, IMHO.<br /><br />I was browsing for this brand on Amazon hoping to find it cheaper by the case, but I do feel it is worth the price I pay for it. I put it in the context of taking my family out for a pasta dinner: even if I use two jars to make a huge pot of pasta, it costs less than it would to feed one of us at a restaurant.

review/text: I'm not much of a pancake person - I like them and eat them occasionally in restaurants, but hadn't made any in about 15 years.  I got this mix as a gift.  These are easily the best pancakes I've ever had.  They are light, fluffy, full of flavor, and absolutely delicious!  I think the malt and vanilla flavoring are what makes them so good.  I looked in the grocery stores to see what ingredients other mixes had, and was unable to find any that didn't contain soy flour! I am concerned about the amount of soy that is added to everything now. This mix has no soy.  I ordered 4 more containers of this mix, along with Stonewall Kitchen raspberry syrup (also to die for) and now I make pancakes about every other weekend.  If you like pancakes, you must try this mix!
