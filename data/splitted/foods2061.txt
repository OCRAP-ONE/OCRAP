review/summary: a great tea for the money
review/text: The flavor of this tea is almost as good at the Teavana variety, but at about 1/3 the cost this is a much better value. The jasmine flavor is very subtle, which I like. The lesser quality jasmine teas have a strong artificial perfume flavor so it pays to spend a little more on a quality tea like this. Also the tea is sealed in a metallic plastic bag inside the tin (which has two metal lids) to preserve freshness. I have been able to get two good steepings from each serving and the little pearls 'bloom' nicely.

review/summary: Tea snobs rejoice
review/text: Yes, this tea isn't cheap, but with some things in the world you get what you pay for and this is one of them. Over the years, I've come to joy the finer Things in life and a nice hot cup of tea is one of them. I remember a few years ago a customer offered me a cup of jasmine tea and I fell in love with it right away and asked where they bought it from and to told me it was from San Francisco. It wasn't until I found this on Amazon that I became reacquainted with that fragrant and delicious tea.<br /><br />I usually drink this at work using a microwave-safe kettle, so this may not be the best way to do it. Since everybody else at work is a coffee drinker, I don't make more than one kettle of tea so I might be wasting the tea pearls but not re-brewing them.  because of this guilt, I discovered that if I put one third the recommended amount and let it through a little longer, I get the same effect. In other words, I use one teaspoon of tea for 24 ounces or so of water.<br /><br />I'm not a doctor so this isn't in any way shape or form medical advice but my father who takes blood pressure medication called me up one evening after I had given him a couple of this tea earlier in the day and asked me to buy him some because he noticed that on a day when he particularly had high blood pressure drinking ditzy dropped his blood pressure down by about 30 points. Again, not a Dr. but according to Dr. Google this is in the realm of possibility.

review/text: Most if not all of their products are A number one.<br />What stands out most in jasmine pearl green tea, is that taste is not compromised by the jasmine's overwhelming smell and love it imparts to the green tea.<br />the flavor comes through each and every time a cup is brewed.

review/summary: My favorite tea thus far (in my life)
review/text: I found this tea at a local organic store. While I was a bit alarmed by the price, the barista in the cafe area convinced me this was the best tea to buy. At the register, the cashier (male) regaled me with his tale of how he never drank tea until he tried this one. I was getting really excited to get home and try it. When I did, I was instantly in love.<br /><br />I have had this both hot and iced (ran it through my ice tea maker) and I must say it is AMAZING either way. Friends have been delighted by this tea when I've served it to them.<br /><br />Since I have given up coffee, I am really indulging in tea, and I was overjoyed to find Rishi Organic Green Tea on Amazon, at a better price than I had previously bought it.

review/summary: Best Jasmine Tea There is Hands Down
review/text: I have had several types of green tea. I have had loose leaf green tea that was Japanese style, and I found that to be very green and grassy flavored. I also have had Rishi's loose leaf green tea, which is good, and a lot more mild flavored. This tea is jasmine green tea pearls... So it has a lovely jasmine flavor plus its rolled into pearls which helps it retain its moisture and flavor content better than loose leaf. It's simply my favorite every day tea.

review/summary: An acquired taste.
review/text: I'll freely admit I'm not a tea connoisseur.  Years ago I lived in England with my Dad who had married a woman who'd been raised in England. That was my indoctrination into drinking tea.  My dad was a coffee snob but me, being 12, and being allowed to drink tea out of a coffee cup was kind of a cool thing. No tea bags in use there.  Given my Dad was a Staff-Sargent in the Air Force with a family of 6, the tea wasn't the high priced stuff either.<br /><br />I've had tea in the South (Texas, Arkansas, Alabama (sweet tea, of course)on the West Coast, and in the mid-west and I've gone through many brands of instant teas, tea bags, sun tea, etc. throughout my life. Recently, I started drinking a brand called Teas'Tea Unsweetened Pure Green tea and Teast'Tea Jasmine Unsweetened Green Tea that's sold in 16.9 oz bottles in the restaurant that's located in the building where I work. A 16.9 oz bottle runs about $2.50 here so it's pricey but has a decent flavor and it's unsweetened so I can add Stevia. I usually buy a couple of bottles a day while I'm at work.<br /><br />(Just on a whim I just checked and both of these are sold through Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017T6S0Y">Teas' Tea Pure Green Unsweetened Tea, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RTNBSA">Ito En Jasmine Japanese Green Tea, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>. It's still a bit pricey considering it's being sold in packages of 12 but it's still about .67 a bottle cheaper than what I'm paying now.  I don't have any stock in the company but I really liked the fact that it's not sweetened with anything and the only additive I've seen is Ascorbic Acid which is Vitamin C.<br /><br />Because I drink between a quart and a half-gallon of tea a day I've been buying gallon jugs of Arizona Diet Tea with Ginseng. Not as pure as the Teas'Tea but not bad. But I figured I could just as easily, and more cheaply (eventually) make my own ice tea.<br /><br />Since I was going through the effort and expense, (I bought an electric kettle <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A5NFQA">Adagio Teas 3 UtiliTEA Variable-Temperature 30-Ounce Electric Kettle</a>, a 32 oz. clear teapot <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RJDX3K">Adagio Teas 32-Ounce Iced Ingenuitea Teapot</a> and a 16 oz. clear teapot <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPN8TK">Adagio Teas 16-Ounce Ingenuitea Teapot</a>) I figured I wanted a high quality Green tea to match.  Since I've been drinking the Jasmine Green Tea from Teas'Tea I did some searching for loose leaf Jasmine Green teas and came across the Rishi brand.<br /><br />I used the electric tea kettle to make sure the temperature was what was recommended on the tin and I followed the instructions and timing for the tea exactly as they are on the tin.  I used a count down app timer on my Android cell phone to make sure I steeped the leaves for just the right amount of time.<br /><br />One thing (that has nothing to do with the taste of the tea but was kind of cool anyways and maybe a reason to buy a clear teapot) was that after the pearls opened up and the leaves expanded it reminded me of an underwater seaweed bed.<br /><br />I first tried a hot cup of tea and I also tried this as cold tea (no ice in it, just chilled). I couldn't get past how strong the jasmine flavor was.  I'm sure part of it is that I've been drinking the Teas'Tea Jasmine Tea and it's not nearly as strong.<br /><br />The tins the tea come in are very well sealed and the contents are very well protected.  The tin's have a second inset lid that seals the can that's under the outer lid and the tea comes in a very thick resealable package (It's like very thick aluminum foil but don't know for sure what it is).<br /><br />Considering the care they take to make it, and package it, I can tell it's a high quality tea and I'm giving it 5 stars because taste is very subjective, but when they sell a Jasmine Tea you definitely get Jasmine.  You should really, really like jasmine to drink this tea.<br /><br />As for me, I think I'm going to go experiment and maybe mix the Teas'Tea Jasmine Tea and this tea to get to a flavor that's a bit milder. I'm apologizing to the purist's in advance... :)

review/summary: Superb Tea
review/text: I ordered the two pack last Christmas, one for me, one for my mother.  I was really happy with the tea, well worth the price.  I found it comparable to the republic of tea dragon pearls, which are more expensive and not organic.  The flavor is very scented without being too much.  I just use 1 tsp to 1 large mug (16 oz) and let steep for a good 5 minutes.  The tea is not bitter, has a nice smooth taste.  I save it for special occasions so it has taken me many months to work through a single can.  I have some plain jasmine tea and this tea is so much better in comparison.

review/text: Not much more to say - Its just that good. I love that you can subscribe and save this product and it just comes every couple of months. I think I've also seen this tea at Whole Foods markets.<br /><br />I hate the jasmine teas that are super florally and the ones that you can barely taste the jasmine. This tea has such a unique and delicate yet delicious jasmine flavor.<br /><br />You only need like 10 pearls to make about 1.5-2 liters of tea (think a midsize tetsubin). After about 5 minutes, I take the tea leaves out and enjoy the tea for about an hour (I have a tea warmer). Another nice thing is that you can use the leaves about 3 times before the flavor goes away.

It's much cheaper than what Teavana or Peets Coffee would sell you.<br /><br />I usually add about 5 pearls to a 16 oz mug and steep it in hot (not boiling!) water. I find that I can reuse the tea leaves two more times if I drink it the same day.

However, we searched Amazon and found the Rishi brand for nearly half the cost! I love that the tea arrives sealed in tins for freshness. We usually brew 1 tablespoon per 16oz (we like big cups of tea!) but you could certainly scale it back because a few pearls goes a long way. Very delicious, delicate flavored tea. I recommend for someone who doesn't think they like green tea. Very pleasant!

review/summary: An incredible tasting tea--gentle and refined
review/text: I bought this on a whim at the Vitamin Shoppe. Sometimes an impulse purchase will be a total bust and other times it provides you with a sublime experience--and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E20E">Rishi Tea Organic Jasmine Pearl Loose Leaf Tea, 2.99-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a> is one such experience.<br /><br />The ingredients are organic green tea and organic jasmine flowers. The tea pearls are mixed with jasmine blossoms until the pearls are infused with the flavor. The directions state to use one tablespoon of tea buds per eight ounces of hot water. I found this to be too much flavor for my personal taste--so I've been using one teaspoon. This results in a wonderful, light flavor that gently tickles the taste buds. The directions also state that one serving of the Jasmine buds can be steeped three times. I did find by the third steeping that the tea became increasingly bitter.<br /><br />I love tea and this one holds a special place on my shelf! Just a wonderful tea for a rainy day, a special day, and in fact, any day!

review/summary: Tremendous tea
review/text: Rishi's Jasmine Pearls are really high quality.  From the moment you open the package, you can smell the heavenly scent of jasmine.  I love watching the little pearls open as they're steeping.  I love this tea. Plus, you can count how many pearls you like in your cup.  It gets strong easily, but once you determine you like your cup with x number of pearls, you don't have to measure again, just count.  The pearls unfurl into beautiful tea leaves as they steep.  I find that this tea needs a little longer to steep and that the pearls won't unfurl if over crowded into too small of a tea ball.  I usually don't use a tea ball with these.  Just put them into a tea pot which has the straining holes in the spout.  The leaves are large enough for that purpose.  This tea is also good when brewed strong and served iced.  I sometimes put agave syrup in mine which really blends well with the jasmine.  It's very fragrant.

review/summary: Fair quality, good value.
review/text: I've been looking for a great tasting low cost Jasmine tea and I was hopeful that this Rishi Tea was the answer. Unfortunately, this tea leaves a little to be desired in terms of taste. This is still a good value for the quantity of tea you receive. Product arrives in a great container and seemed very fresh. Overall I am satisfied, but not wow'ed with my purchase.

review/summary: Worth the hype!
review/text: While there are already plenty of other reviews praising this tea, I simply feel as though I must do the same.<br /><br />It has such a wonderful aroma and smooth taste. I usually add a bit of agave nectar to mine but can drink it by itself, which is nice considering I can't do that with most green teas. Wholesome Sweeteners makes some great Agave Nectars.<br /><br />As others have said, you definitely don't need to use 1 tablespoon for just a cup... That's either a goof or an attempt to get you to burn through your tea and buy more ASAP.<br /><br />I bought the single tin to try, and have had so much tea it's practically gone in less than a month!! From now on I am going to buy the 2 pack. Do yourself a favor and believe what others are saying. If you like tea, you'll like this!

review/summary: beautiful, delicate, Exquisite!  I'm DOOMED!
review/text: I've been on a mission for almost a month now to try and find the perfect tea. When I follow directions and make this tea properly, this is one of the most delightful teas I've ever had. To me, this tea had more jasmine fragrance than many others have. Unfortunately, sometimes I don't follow directions and even have been known to run with Scissors! Due to my being absent minded at times, I have left this lovely tea to brew too long and then it leaves the funniest aftertaste and my mouth feels all dried out and puckered up. Otherwise, this is an absolutely wonderful tea. I guess I'm just DOOMED to drinking sub-par tea for the REST OF MY LIFE as it appears that I'm incompetant to brew a correct cup of tea on a consistent basis. Well, as they say, "It takes all kinds to fill the world". Unless, someone volunteers to come over and make my tea for me---- ? Otherwise, it's back to drinking Salada which never gets bitter no matter how I abuse it.

review/summary: Delicious, but ignore the instructions!
review/text: I concur with many of the other reviewers that this makes a delicious cup of tea.  It's also very well packaged: a thick, well sealed bag that you can store in the nice airtight tin once it's opened.  Quality all round.<br /><br />I also agree, though, that the brewing instructions on the tin are very wrong.  They say to use a tablespoon for one 8oz cup, and brew for 3-4 minutes.  That's way too much.  I tend to brew a 36oz pot, and for that I use about 1 1/2 teaspoons brewed for around 2 minutes (you can use the leaves a second or even a third time though, as they say).  The flavour is supposed to be delicate, not blow your socks off, but even using that quantity of tea produces a very tasty and aromatic brew.  And this comes from someone who likes black tea made strong enough to stand your spoon up in it.<br /><br />Similar products from other sellers give brewing instructions much closer to mine, so I can only assume that the instructions on these were simply an error (or they want everyone to burn through a tin in a few days).

review/summary: WONDERFUL Tea!
review/text: This is a very nice tasting, quality tea! I agree with other reviewers that a teaspoon is plenty to use for each cup rather than the tablespoon suggested. The Jasmine smells wonderful and is very relaxing. I have been much happier (more relaxed and less anxious) since I started drinking it. It also had an unexpected benefit for me. I have developed horrible allergies on my hands (contact dermatitis/eczema). Nothing has helped in the 8 months since the symptoms developed. Any cream or antihistamine from several doctors was only temporary fix and had nasty side effects. This is the cool part, since starting drinking the tea daily a week ago, my hands have cleared up by at least 50%. No more raised rash or itching so bad that I wanted to tear my hands off. It is too soon to tell if it will heal them entirely but any relief from the symptoms is wonderful. I've already ordered two more cans just so I won't run out!

review/text: Yes this is a five star tea. If you have ever bought tea at Teavana this is just as good. Yes it is expensive but well worth it. I steep 5 balls in a coffee mug for a couple of minutes. And unlike other green teas this tea when left in the mug does not get bitter. I have taken it to work and after two or three hours it still taste good. It can be reused one time and still taste great.

review/summary: Simply delicious
review/text: As a recent health food consumer, I only began drinking green teas a month ago (after reading Anticancer by Dr. Servan-Schreiber). Although the packaged teabags I have are still of great use to me, I cannot ignore how fresh and delicious this loose tea tastes. Although I enjoy grassier tasting teas such as Numi Gunpowder tea, I also like sweeter and lighter teas (Celestial Seasonings Antioxidant Green Tea) and the Rishi Jasmine Pearl falls into the latter category. It has a smooth, delicate taste and sweet smell that simply puts me in a good mood when I drink it--a great stress reliever for a grad student.<br /><br />I can't wait to try the other Rishi teas!

review/text: This stuff is like a drug. The buddha said that secular happiness can be found through the delight of the five senses. I always forget about the joy of good smells. I can sniff this stuff for hours. The smell makes me so happy. The jasmine is very fresh and rich. And the taste is unbelievable. I echo the comments of other users that you should use less tea per volume than the directions call for. Plus it will make your tea supply last longer. The roiboos tea is also great.

review/summary: So THAT'S what tea looks like!
review/text: I think it's a sad commentary on our modern world that after decades of drinking tea, I only just discovered what tea leaves look like. I don't mean the flakes and powder in your typical tea bag...I mean actual leaves of tea.<br /><br />This is the best tea I've ever had. In some ways it doesn't even taste like tea (or what I've known as tea). It's less bitter, and less astringent.<br /><br />The only reservation I had about this product was the price, and I was a little concerned when I opened the first tin and saw that 1/3 of it was empty space. However, after using the product for a few weeks I think this tea is actually a great value. A little bit goes a long way. I've been drinking this tea daily for 3 weeks and I've only used 1/3 of a tin.  At that rate I would have used over 20 teabags, or two boxes (which I've come to realize are mostly wrapper, filter, and cardboard). Per serving, I think this is cheaper than any tea you can buy in the grocery store.<br /><br />Last thing is how to filter it. I bought this filter around the same time:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I68NCS">Finum Brewing Medium Basket, Black</a><br />...and I can't recommend it highly enough.

This tea is perfect for any occasion - on a rainy day, while reading, or for guests. My mom came to visit and I brewed this tea for her and she hasn't stopped brewing this tea since! I highly recommend this tea. This is also a great deal for a pack of two. I thought I was only getting one. I haven't reviewed any of my purchases before but thought that this tea really deserved a five star review :)

review/summary: Tastes great but costs much more
review/text: I just tried this product. I used one of the entire 3-ounce packages with 128 ounces of water after bringing the water to 180 degrees in the microwave (I like to make tea in quantity). After expanding, the package of pearls fits perfectly in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047Z2FKW">New Twist-Lock Spice Ball Tea Infuser Herb Infuser, Stainless Steel, Extra Large Size (4 x 3.5")</a>. I was able to make another 64 ounces of tea reusing the peals but it was half as strong and not as good. Now, Rishi Jasmine Pearl is 5 to 10 times more expensive than tea bags (costing $.50 to $.75 a cup) but it's a completely different flavor and so can't be compared.<br /><br />I know I will likely offend the purests here with what I did next - I added three individual packets of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4DXE">Crystal Light On The Go Natural Lemonade, 10 Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a> (enough for 48 ounces in the 128 ounces of water). But, the acid (I assume) wholly changed the flavor of this tea (much greater effect than I've found with any other tea). I'm not surprised that a Google search shows green tea lemonade is a fairly popular recipe. This combination is now a favorite drink. My next experiment will have to be with a couple of cups of fresh squeezed lemon juice.<br /><br />I'm trying green tea because L-theanine (the amino acid providing the unique flavor of the tea) has been shown to boost one's immune system as well as to reduce mental and physical stress (in other words, untwisting twisted thinking ... this was my primary goal as I often get mentally jumbled with to-do lists, etc). L-theanine is supposed to be helpful for concentration (improving cognition and mood purportedly in a synergistic manner with caffeine) and relaxation. Thus, L-theanine can be found both in many nighttime sleep aids (without, of course, the caffeine) as well as daytime power drinks.<br /><br />UPDATE: Don't make a large quantity - the tea becomes very bitter, even undrinkable, after a couple of days.<br /><br />2nd UPDATE: S.L. mentioned the contamination issue. Salmonella is a problem with eggs, hamburger, etc. However, I understand tea that has been sitting at room temperature for any length of time (such as Sun Tea or by adding new tea to a used pitcher as is commonly done at resturants) is a notorious source instead of the coliform bacteria (I believe salmonella is more about handling issues - for example, four years ago a Arizona tea vendor made 14 people sick with improper washing). Thus, one should never keep brewed tea for more than eight hours at room temperature ("Sun" tea is better made in the frig over night). Even refrigerated fresh tea will last only 2-3 days... and fresh lemon juice has the same limited shelf life. Don't drink if the tea appears darker. Many restaurants "solve" these problems by switching to instant tea and "garbage" sweeteners (which in no way defeat the positive effects of Green Tea's L-theanine) as they will remain good to drink much much longer. Fresh tea leaves also often themselves become contaminated with coliform bacteria. I assume this is why bagged teas brew tea that lasts days longer as well as the point for the serious packaging used in this product (I've also found store bought mango and orange juice used for sweetening last much longer than fresh as well). Again thusly, making large quantities of tea to use for more than a few days afterward wholly defeat the purpose of a healthy drink - even worse than coffee or root beer (banned for its ill effects)... ha ha.<br /><br />I now use half of a 3-ounce Rishi Tea package in a 51 ounce bottle of Highland Spring Water (crisp and not mineralized water is key to good tea as chlorinated, deoxygenated, and hard tap water will produce negative interactions) to "brew" several days in the frig. I then add three 17-ounce bottles of Orange Mango Sparkling ICE Spring Water (which already contains a small amount of green tea) and the juice from a couple lemons (I still find the fruit acid very important to a far better flavor).

At the Amazon price I would have saved a couple bucks on the 2 cans since it qualifies for super-saver shipping.

After trying several I finally decided to go online to find the tea that I liked in the past.  I found the Rishi Tea and bought a 2-Pack of the jasmine Pearl.  I love the smooth taste and the wonderful blend of tea and jasmine flower.  All flavors in this tea are equally balanced and provide a very flavorful experience.  I also like this tea because I can brew it two to three times and still obtain a nice flavor.  I Highly recommend this tea.

review/text: This is the best fricken' jasmine pearl you can buy.  The jasmine aroma knocks  your socks off and it is smooth and delicious to drink.  Rishi Teas area high quality teas across the board.  I buy several of the whites from their site.  I just finished off a pound of Rishi's jasmine pearls and bought a pound of Numi's jasmine pearls to save money.  I've had it before and it's good.  I opened the Numi bag and immediately wondered, where is the jasmine aroma??  Sorry for cheating on you Rishi, I'm coming back!

review/summary: Not quite sure about the five stars
review/text: I purchased this and the tea itself is nice. But if you want a full pot, you only get about 4-6 per can, which makes it pretty expensive. It is good, but I would say not quite as good as the price. The flavor is pretty overpowering and the essense is best for hot tea, rather than iced. I am not a tea affectionato, but do love coffee and some earl and green  teas.

review/summary: Great Food
review/text: I actually bought this food to add to my mix of ferret food. (both ferrets and cats are obligate carnivores so their nutritional needs are similar). My first ferret was on cheap, corn-based, WalMart  ferret food. He reeked to high heaven, his coat was rough and coarse, and he pooped huge piles. I switched him to this, and he's filled out amazingly well. His coat is sleek and shiny and I get comments all the time about how he doesn't smell. I've since added 2 other foods to my mix but am definitely keeping the Natures Variety Duck. It's hard to find a ferret food that isn't chicken based and I like them to have a bit of "variety" haha.

review/summary: Adds Great Flavor to Dishes
review/text: I usually buy this brand at my local store.  By chance, I found that you can buy these cheaper here at Amazon.  Since I use dried porcini mushrooms a lot for soups, Crockpot dishes, pasta dishes, and more, I was pleased to find that I can buy 12 packages and save a lot.  Yes, you do have to soak them for a few minutes and strain the soaking liquid, but most all dried mushrooms have the same directions, I've found.  This is just to ensure that you don't get bits of grit in your finished product since commercial mushrooms are grown in sterile compost material.  I still use the soaking liquid (after staining it) because the liquid itself adds a lot of flavor to the dish.

review/summary: Pellegrino Review
review/text: For a number of years, I have purchased Pellegrino by the case at, Costco.  I have three problems with Pellegrino:<br /><br />(1) I don't know how much a bottle used to hold, but to me it seems that the bottles over the years have decreased in size, it seems like the company slimmed down the bottle to hold less water.  I am certain the price didn't decrease.<br /><br />(2) Just recently, I purchased a case and found the seal on the bottles so insufficient that I have had to pour out all the contents of a newly opened bottle, no fizz. Just this weekend I had to pour out the water in two brand new bottles.<br /><br />(3) If I do have a newly opened bottle that is fizzy, I've also noticed that the bottle tops do not hold the fizz for long after the bottle has been opened, say only a few days in the fridge.  I usually replace the Pellegrino top by recycling a lid from a plastic Coke bottle.<br /><br />I have heard that the store, ShopRite has a nice store-named product that is imported from Italy and tastes like Pellegrino. I'm switching.<br /><br />(Let's hope ShopRite keeps the cost reasonable, keeps bottle size the same, and has a better lid.)

review/summary: Best Irish Spirit
review/text: IMHO, this is the best whisk(e)y Ireland has to offer. Many would argue in favor of Bushmills, maybe Tyrconnell, but I would disagree.  Green Spot, made by the same distillery, would maybe edge this one out, but it is unavailable in the US. Redbreast is simply a well-crafted and flavorful single malt. Triple distillation and the pot still shape gives it a unique and very smooth delivery. As a single malt scotch lover, I find the Redbreast to be every bit as good as many of my favorite Speysiders. Shop around and you can find it for a very friendly price. Recommended

review/summary: Redbreast 12 is creamy and complex - a sophisticated Irish whiskey.
review/text: Redbreast is an old Irish whiskey mark, but the current incarnation is a product of Irish Distillers and made at the Midleton Distillery in Cork.  This is where Midleton (the finest whiskey made in Ireland) is made - as well as Jameson.  The new Redbreast has been getting rave reviews and has a big following in Ireland.  Here are my tasting notes:<br /><br />Beautiful golden honey-bronze in the glass.  Aroma is creamy and mild with a hint of sherry.  After more time in the glass (give this one plenty of time to open up) there are red fruit notes and vanilla joining the cream sherry.  Lovely.  First sip gives us the sweet and clean Irish whiskey flavors of minty spirit but immediately a rich and creamy oily quality emerges and a host of new floral, sherry, oaky vanilla, and fruit flavors appear in the mid-palate.  The fruit notes I'm getting are sultanas (white grape raisins).  Finish is longer than usual for an Irish whiskey, with baked goods, more sultanas, and that sherry oak quality lingering.<br /><br />I've just used a lot of flavor words but the dominant impression I get is a creamy mildness.  "Smooth" is an over-used word in connection with whiskey and almost a bad word when talking about single malts - but this is an extremely rich, creamy, smooth malt - well seasoned with sherry, fruit and oak.  It's a very mellow and easy drink - but with an excellent, if subtle, character.  Balance, richness, poise and fuller flavor profile that most Irish whiskeys.  A honey and a keeper.

These have a robust flavor, beanie but a little cheesey, with enough salt to make them very tempting.  The slightly higher fat content than other healthy snacks makes them very satisfying.  I don't find I want to eat the whole bag.  I find the Cheddar Cheese flavor a little too spicy for my palate, but the Black Bean (not Chipolte) are excellent, as are the Pinto and Flax.  I cannot recommend these enough.  A good way to get your fiber and stay away from corn.

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.  Nice cheese flavor.
review/text: I recently tried these, after usually sticking to the Black Bean Sea Salt flavor.  These are certainly different from that flavor, but just as enjoyable.  The cheese flavoring is the perfect flavor for my pallet.  I won't switch to these from the Sea Salt ones, but will definitely add them to my chip rotation.<br /><br />Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories. That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste. To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings. I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these and wish that the bags contained less air and more chips, but otherwise I think they are great. I highly recommend that you try them.  The pricing here on Amazon, is usually about 30 cents per 6 ounce bag cheaper than what they charge at the local grocery store, HEB.  Specialty stores like Sprouts and Whole Foods charge even more for them.

The regular price is $2.69 per bag.<br /><br />After trying these out for a few weeks, I am hooked!

review/text: These have a superb flavor for a low-glycemic product. That's 'low-glycemic' if you pay attention to the standard serving size, which is a generous 10 chips. Had previously only made note of the cheese flavor and could not understand one reviewer's comment about them being 'spicey'. But we eat a lot of Indian food, so had not noticed them being spicey. After having not eaten anything really spicey for about a week, then eating some of these, we noticed the heat. Just a little, enough to make them not boring. They are plenty stiff enough to use with even a thick dip like guacamole.<br /><br />They arrived fast and packaged well; were not all broken up. We will continue to purchase them here since our local health food store can't seem to keep them in stock.

review/summary: Love them, tastes like bean dip!
review/text: I grew up at this restaurant with excellent bean and cheese dip.  The fried flour chips are terrible for you and the extra cheese on the bean dip is also terrible, but oh so tasty.  This chip actually brings me back to that dip - but they're actually HEALTHY.  What?!  They are slightly spicy if you have had a bunch of them- my 2 year old loves them too - I buy these and eat them whenever I want to pig out on something not good for me (which is often...) and I'm totally satisfied!  I usually eat two servings but at it's a heck of lot better than most alternatives.  I wish these were included in Prime and I'd subscribe and save.  Mmmm<br />Oh, I've tried the plain black bean ones which I found a little bitter and slightly burnt tasting- but I think that was just the pure black bean flavor - I love black beans, but didn't like the chips.  However, I have not tried the plain pinto ones or the black bean chipotle bbq - that could be good...

I can eat beanitos practically guilt free and they make me full and satisfied much sooner than with the leading tortilla chips. Even my kids love them. Seal of approval from our family!

review/summary: These are the dried cherries you want
review/text: Dried bing cherries are too sweet. You want the dried �tart� cherries that make for good snacking. This package and bulk packages are perfect. Full warning, there is some sulfur in dried cherries, so expect some eggy reaction.

review/summary: Beware - HFCS
review/text: I went to their site where they say these cherries are sweetened with sugar. The packages we got were sweetened, not with sugar, but with High Fructose Corn Syrup. Said so right on the package. Wouldn't have bought them if I'd known that. HFCS is so bad for you even famous soft drink manufacturers are replacing it with sugar.<br /><br />Misleading descriptions are a poor showing by these folks.

review/summary: Dried Fruit
review/text: Great to have in the pantry, these cherries, and the other dried fruits and vegetables by this supplier are excellent in quality. They come well packaged, but without any fuss.<br /><br />It isn't the packaging that sells these products; they are really good.

review/summary: Ours says it's from China
review/text: I'm sorry but our Tone's Minced Garlic says it's a product of China. While I do love Chinese food I can't knowingly ingest food from China. I wish Amazon food listings had to state their country of origin. I wanted to be fair with the rating. Each person of course decides for themselves.

review/text: These are really difficult to eat during a run but eating them about half an hour before a race gives you a great boost of energy for the race.  I've set a couple of PR's since I added these to my pre-race routine!

review/text: These beans are for use with intensive exercise to replace electrolytes lost from sweat.  There is no caffeine to wake you up...  I really like these much easier to eat while running than other chews I have tried the perfect size.  Good flavor-a little extra sweet,but tasty!

review/summary: This item does not work... but tastes ok...
review/text: This product does not work... I have bought 5 of each... I ate one packet because I wanted to get a little bit of energy, because I was staying up late, but I ended up sleeping 20 minutes later... Now, I cant sleep without it!!!<br /><br />As for the taste, all in all, they all taste ok. I recommend the orange flavour... and I really dislike the fruit punch...

review/summary: Coconut Snow Replacement!
review/text: This mix makes an EXCELLENT Pina Colada - great for those of you who "knew" MeleKoi's "Coconut Snow" when it was available.<br /><br />"Concord Foods 'Smoothie' Tropical Pineapple" mix in a packet that, when using 2 cups of pineapple juice, ice, and some rum, makes a mighty fine, darned-near Coconut Snow Pina Colada experience after blending for a minute.<br /><br />Their Web site is ... http://www.concordfoods.com<br /><br />In local stores, this stuff costs about two bucks a packet. A packet makes a little over two drinks. Enjoy!<br /><br />Clint Bradford, Mira Loma CA US

review/summary: Total yum!
review/text: This stuff is great!  Terrific flavor, great texture, and oh so many uses.<br /><br />It's wonderful on crackers, bruschetta, pita chips, etc.  I've also used it as a base for goat-cheese pizzas.<br /><br />The jars are on the small side -- 3 1/2 oz -- about 1/2 Cup -- but that's OK for me.  I don't usually use that much at one time (unless I'm doing pizza), so a jar can last awhile.<br /><br />I can't find this locally.  None of my local markets carry it -- they carry another type of sundried tomato "pesto"-type sauce, but this stuff is SO much better.  So I'll continue to order it online as long as it's available.

review/summary: Buy it to make stuffed mushrooms -- yummmm!
review/text: Bought this initially based on the positive reviews here, but couldn't convince my husband it was worth eating.  Then we saw the recipe inside the cardboard wrapper for baked stuffed mushrooms.  Turns out, you use a whole jar, plus a few other ingredients (cheese, mainly, no meat) to make a very easy appetizer-sized serving for 3 or 4 people.  Wow!!  The stuffed mushrooms are absolutely sensational.  My husband now constantly reminds me to buy more of this stuff, and our guests rave more about the appetizers than the main course.  We keep several jars on hand and give a surprising number away to grateful guests who want to go home and make their own.  This is a real winner.

review/summary: Also Delicous!
review/text: I gave almost the same review of their Katamala Olive Tapenade because I use them together.  My wife got me hooked on this stuff. Before that I had never even heard the word "tapenade". We like to combine one jar of this with one jar of their Katamala Olive Tapenade and a splash of red wine. Mix it up and put it on some Crostinis. You wont be disappointed. I'm normally a meat-and potatoes-guy, and I love this stuff.

review/summary: disgraceful packaging, damaged product
review/text: This is a delicious tapenade, 5 stars for the food product itself. The problem is Amazon.<br />I ordered my first box of 6 jars several months ago and recently decided to reorder it. I've nothing but praise for the delicious product. The problem is Amazon's shipping department.<br />My first reordered box, which arrived in late May, was a disgusting, lumpy, discoloured cardboard confection of 6 jars in a tight cardboard box with heavy plastic shrink wrap, shipped inside a flimsy, small, outer shipping box. It was clear that jar(s) inside had broken in shipping at some point. Almost 4/5 of the cardboard inner box was discoloured with oil and food staining - over half the box, there was mould growing. It was repulsive.<br />I called Amazon, reported this, they sent a replacement, and I threw out the entire mouldy package, unopened.<br />I received the replacement package last week. Again the box of 6 jars was sealed in an inner cardboard box with heavy plastic shrink wrap (and inside a larger Amazon shipping box, properly packaged). Regardless, there was again some discoloured cardboard over one end of the inner box (thankfully no mould).<br />I opened the inner box to examine the contents. Four jars of tapenade were spotless, in perfect shape, so I kept them. The other two jars had packaging soaked in oil and discolouration. The metal screw tops on both jars had been badly dented and damaged, allowing the oil and food to seep out - and undoubtedly, since this is a tomato product, allowing bacteria to seep into the jars. I threw out these two jars, as their condition posed a serious health hazard.<br />Upon examining all parts of the packaging, I observed that the larger shipping box and air-filled-pouches padding material inside were well assembled, unstained, and not the cause of the damage. Clearly the smaller, shrink-wrapped cardboard box holding the 6 jars had been damaged *before* it was packed into the larger shipping box. It appears that the shrink-wrapped inner box had been dropped or crushed just on one end (damaging the two jars and their lids mentioned above). So although Amazon's shipping department is blameless for its good packaging job, Amazon's warehouse department (pre-shipping) not only damaged the smaller box of jars, but then sent them on to be shipped to a customer!!<br />This is deplorable behaviour. I will no longer be ordering this delicious tapenade from Amazon and will demand further refund for this fiasco. I'm angry and very disappointed.

review/summary: It's grass in a box!
review/text: Got this item because it had Prime shipping on it despite the other two negative reviews. Tried it out, actually worked just fine. Since cats don't really like old grass and mostly like to eat young grass, this worked perfectly. I put water in it and let it sprout, which it did fairly successfully. It grew much more than I thought it would after a week.<br /><br />My cat munched on it and looked fairly satisfied, and vomited up a bunch of grass later to thank me, which I pretty much expected. For those of you buying pet grass, you should note that cats appear to be designed to vomit grass, food, water, dust, and fur. But grass will probably add more vomiting, even though they like to eat it.<br /><br />This box sprouted fine, cat liked it fine, price was ok. I'd get it again, it was hassle free, and i'm lazy, I threw the whole box out when the grass got old enough that the cat wouldn't eat it anymore.
