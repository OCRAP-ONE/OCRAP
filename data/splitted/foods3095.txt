review/text: This coffee has a very tropical taste to it, so it's perfect for iced coffee on a hot day.  The flavor is not bad when heated, but it just seems a little odd.<br /><br />You don't usually think of tropical beverages being hot.

review/summary: Pleasant, smooth and flavorful cup of coffee
review/text: We have been enjoying our order of W.Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya dark roast coffee K-cups for the last week.  We find the delicious flavor very satisfying...not so strong to be bitter, and not so weak as to taste like colored water.  The coffee is perfect. There is just the right amount of heartiness to make it an enjoyable coffee experience, and it carries a nice lingering pleasant flavor and aroma.  It is not as strong as an espresso, but maybe one step below.  Like we said, "pleasant, smooth, and flavorful!"

review/text: I was intrigued how this particular blend got such an exotic name, and I wasn't disappointed.  There is an ever so slight coconut aftertaste that makes this so delicious,  I don't like strong coffee, and this is perfect for my husband and I.  I get it send regularly now and it's one of our favorites!  Second only to Jamaica Me Crazy by Wolfgang Puck.  Wolfgang is much tastier than the other brands.

review/summary: Exquisitely Flavored Medium Coffee
review/text: I tried this coffee on a half dozen quests this weekend and they all loved it.  For those that like their coffee mild, I brewed 7 oz cups.  For those of us that like it bold, I brewed 5 oz cups.<br /><br />As an earlier posted noted, it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees.  The taste isn't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee "regular and black" but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention.<br /><br />I plan on trying all of Wolfgang's line.  Wish he'd offer a variety pack.

review/summary: My Favorite K-Cup
review/text: My wife and I have decided hands down, this is our favorite K-cup. We've tried a lot of others, and Donut Shop and Caribu Daybreak are certainly still up there. However, this has a very solid body flavor with a medium roast. Almost a bold flavor with a smooth finish. Excellent flavor versus strength. Really nice to get up on a lazy Sunday morning and have a nice cup of Breakfast in Bed!<br /><br />Also, I see another reviewer had problems with messy K-cups. I can say after about 6 boxes of theses, I haven't had any issues. Very unfortunate for the other reviewer, but looks like it was rather isolated.<br /><br />Give it a try, you'll certainly enjoy it, the wife and I sure do!

review/summary: Unremarkable
review/text: First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.

review/text: Of all the K-Cup flavors that are out there, and there are many very good ones, this is one of my least favorites, and I have tried almost all of them.  Not much flavor to this one, even if you add various types of creamers.  Of course, it is all a matter of taste, but this one doesn't taste all that good.  It is not bad - it is just kind of there - like a generic coffee.  Try something else instead.

review/summary: Jamaica Me Happy!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Jamaica Me Crazy coffee.  There was a time in my life when I was totally caffeine free and off the dark stuff, but a customer in the bank I worked at brought in a pound of this coffee as a gift to the tellers.  Every time someone walked by my desk with a cup of this freshly made joe, the smell would really tempt me to go back to consuming coffee again.  Eventually it broke me down, and I am back to being a full time coffee drinker, and proud of it! Imagine how happy I was to find my favorite brew in a K-cup!  The only thing better than a cup of Jamica Me Crazy is a cup sweetened with the new Almond Joy flavor International Creamer in it to highlight the sweet coconut.  Unfortunately, we only have a Keurig at our office (I'm in Real Estate now), so I have to go to work to enjoy a cup.  I'm thinking I have a brilliant boss who knows how to get people to willingly show up to work! Now if I can just figure a way to use it to temp more buyers into our office - I'd have it made ;0)

I have gotten many different kinds of the k-cups to try but after trying this one, I think I could be happy with just this one and black tiger for those mornings when I want a really strong cup of coffee.  The rodeo drive blend is delicious with a nice round feel on the palate and an interesting flavor on the finish with just a hint of smokiness.  Perfectly balanced and absolutely wonderful!  Plus, I have to admit...I love the label. The different color looks very appealing on my carousel with the other k-cups.

review/text: For years, I've been completely devoted to Dunkin Donuts brewed at the store and at home.  I tried brewing DD in my K cup and I also bought the Eco Brew and the actual DD k cups.  Awful!  So I was searching high and low for a new coffee.  After trying all the decaf k cups on the market, I finally found and loved Wolfgang Puck decaf coffee k cups.  This is the only place I can find them so I hope Amazon never stops selling them here.  They are mellow, medium roast and I enjoy them every day.  Any other brand is just a back up.  Try them.  I have never had any trouble with any of the cups and I'm on my third order now of 48 cups.  If they had a problem, they've fixed it.<br /><br />This is an update being done on July 7, 2012.  I continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee EVERY day.  It has ruined me for other coffees as I measure every other cup against this incredible Wolfgang Puck Decaf k cup.  Please, please, PLEASE Amazon, make this part of your subscription service.  My head hurts trying to make sure that I always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee.

review/summary: Successful experiment!
review/text: Our Keurig coffee maker was a great Christmas gift last year. One of the pleasures of this device is the experimentation with various coffee blends. Some have worked well; others have not. Some are too mild; some are a bit "off" on taste.<br /><br />This Wolfgang Puck product is one of the more successful experiments with the Keurig machine. It has a rich taste and still remains smooth. Not too strong a flavor, but it does have flavor.<br /><br />So, the two coffee drinkers in my household are quite pleased to drink this brew.

review/summary: Great, but not perfect
review/text: I roast my own Colombian beans at home so I have a perfect "10" for reference. Right off the bat let me say that just like their Sumatran reserve, this k-cup is not bitter, but smooth. The aftertaste is also smooth. My chief complaint is it does not taste like a Colombian bean. It really is missing the deep flavor of a columbian coffee, while the Sumatran Puck K-cup definitely has a Sumatran taste. The "8 oclock" brand you see in many grocery stores has a more distinct flavor than this k-cup. That being said, my final recommendation is that I would recoommend the Puck Sumatran over this if you like a distinct coffee flavor. However, if you are looking for a not-too-stong-but-not-bitter coffee, this Colombian is a great choice. I would buy this again just because of the smooth taste.

review/summary: Spicy sweetness!
review/text: I've always been drawn to K-Cup varieties with out there names (Jet Fuel, Black Tiger) and distinctive flavors (Golden French Toast, Spicy Mayan Chocolate). This offering melds those two features into something I'm happy to wake up to!<br /><br />To me, Jamaica Me Crazy's definitely got a pervasive coconut taste fairly similar to Dunkin' Donuts coconut flavored coffee, but it's also got a lot of the flavor characteristics I've come to expect from K-Cup chocolate brews. Barely any of that acidic aftertaste that's almost inevitable with artificial flavors, and definitely not as watery as many other K-cup varieties. Sure, the name's pretty corny and the taste is hardly subtle or sophisticated, but that's what makes this cup of joe so fun!

I'll be buying more of this, especially around the holidays, because it's much cheaper than getting it at Starbucks. Would make a nice little add-on gift to someone or stocking stuffer.

review/text: I thought I had found a perfect Christmas gift for an out of town sister who is allergic to chocolate.  I ordered and shipped a gift basket called "Something Sweet & Savory."  It contained no chocolate.  I was on vacation when the basket arrived and did not hear that my sister received a gift basket containing primarily chocolate until I returned home January 1. I contacted Wine.com immediately.  They replied that she should return the basket and they would ship another one.  My sister had tossed the packing box by that time and had no way to return the basket.  I again contacted Wine.com and they gave the same reply.  "Return the basket first."  She cannot use the contents or return the basket.  Stalemate.  Wine.com offered NO OTHER REMEDY.  And -- to add insult to injury -- my sister never did receive a package of Harry & David chocolate covered nuts.  I will never order from this retailer again.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DKA7HM">Wine.com Something Sweet & Savory Gift Basket</a>

review/summary: Sweet and savory snacks in a nice gift basket
review/text: This Wine.com Something Sweet & Savory Gift Basket comes with a variety of sweet and savory snacks in a well crafted and sturdy basket, wrapped in cellophane, and topped with a red bow. The packaging is slightly different from what is depicted in the main picture of this web page. I have uploaded a couple of pictures of this basket as it was just out of the shipping carton, the way the gift recipient would have seen it. It looks good. The goodies are in nicely printed and well-designed boxes and match exactly what are described on the web page. They are delicious. I like the Partners toasted sesame crackers especially. I ate them with a sliver of the Sonoma pepper jack cheese. The crackers are fresh and crunchy and the cheese flavorful - yummy! The basket is oval and measures 11" X 14" at the widest points and 3-1/2" deep with crescent handles. The rim and bottom are made of wicker and the sides are woven out of ropes. (Yours may vary.) After one eats up all the goodies, one can use this basket for oven-baked hot rolls or silk flower arrangement on the dinning table. This basket will make a nice gift as a token of appreciation to my friendly neighbors who collect my mail and watch over my house while my family is away for vacation. I wouldn't give it to my little woman for our wedding anniversary, however. For that occasion, a brand new BMW Z4 roadster with a giant bow on the hood would be more appropriate.

The trail mix wasn't too bad, but I just don't think it was worth the price. The boxes of snacks were pretty small, and if I had to purchase what was inside this gift basket, I would say that I would only spend about $13.00, and that would include the basket itself.

review/summary: Reasonable price, contents a little different
review/text: As gift baskets go, this one is OK.  The price is reasonable and the contents are a little different than usually seen.  The presentation is also good.  It is hard to be positive about the gift baskets as it is so easy to put one together yourself for about half the price but if you have to send one this is a good one.

It's hard to buy them stuff but we knew they liked to eat.  They said they forced themselves to pace themselves and that's why it lasted a few days versus just one or two days.  As it was a gift I don't know who it looked or what it came with but they seemed to like it and that's all that matters to me.

review/text: I was looking for a pancake/waffle mix with natural ingredients and no hydrogenated vegetable oil (trans fats) and tried Canterbury Naturals Old Fashioned Pancake & Waffle Mix. I followed the mixing directions, added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and these pancakes tasted very close to my Mom's homemade recipe but without the fuss. The pancakes have a tender texture and great taste. My family loves these pancakes and so do I.

review/text: The first time I made these pancakes they were flat. I probably would not have tried them again, except I bought a six pack to begin with because I absolutely LOVE many of the Canterbury products.  The second time I made them I added less water than what is called for, and they turned out perfectly!  They were very fluffy.  And now my kids ask me to make these for them all the time.  Definitely has become a family favorite and I make them over and over.  I would highly recommend trying them.  Don't be disappointed the first time because you do have to find the right variation for you.  Our favorite way to make them is with chocolate chips.  :)

review/summary: Reminiscent of Childhood Breakfasts in Southern France
review/text: Bonne Maman is a great line of preserves, and finding out they made Fig Preserves absolutely made my day. I had found their more traditional flavors at my local grocery, but happened upon their fig preserves at a boutique cafe in my area. However, they were charging $6.99 per jar. I love fig preserves, but $7 is a bit steep. I grew up with a French father, and spent lots of time visiting family in Southern France. I remember having my Aunt's homemade fig preserves on fresh baguettes and croissants for breakfast in the morning throughout my life. I developed a taste for preserves made from mirabelle plums, figs, and still love strawberry as well. And, while Smuckers Strawberry Preserves are fine for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, it's just not the taste or quality I love for breakfast. Bonne Maman also makes a great strawberry, and Four Fruits preserves as well, but fig is by far the best in my opinion. All their fruit preserves have more pieces of real fruit in them than your standard American brands. I love having an actual strawberry or fig turn up on my english muffin rather than just more flavored corn syrup. When I found the fig preserves, in particular, here on Amazon at a more reasonable price (around $4.25 a jar) I was sold immediately. I will definitely use 6 jars of this within several months time, and certainly before they go bad. The irony of this find was that the day after I finally had ordered and received my first 6 jars I stopped by a grocery I don't frequent. There in the jam and jelly aisle were Bonne Maman Fig Preserves on sale for $1.99/jar. I had no idea. Needless to say, I will be checking there first, but will absolutely be buying these again if a $7 jar is my only other option. These are great preserves, and the only better ones I've found come from my Aunt's kitchen. They're a little harder to come by these days.

review/summary: Slows down my dog
review/text: I bought this bowl for a black lab who inhales his food.  It's definitely slowed him down.  After hearing sad stories of dogs who died from the Bloat I was anxious to find a bowl that would slow my dog down.  What I like about this particular bowl is that it's not made of lightweight plastic, the weight of the stainless steel helps it to stay put, along with a non-slip rubber grip on the base of the bowl.  It stays in place and doesn't end up tipped over or pushed under the cabinet toe-kick. Plastic bowls get scratched up on the inside after so much use, you don't have that problem with stainless steel.  And you never really know if there's bacteria on the plastic, with stainless steel it's easy to steralize.

This was nice looking and well made but, after one or two feedings, she was right back to her old speed in eating.  This leaves too much room between the bump and sides so a smart pup just eats around the bump as fast as ever.

review/summary: DIDN'T SLOW THEM DOWN ONE BIT!!!
review/text: I have 2 miniature doxies and a small Sheltie. All three love to wolf down their food. I purchased 3 small bowls hoping it would help. The bowls were huge for the small size. They didn't change a thing. They inhale just the same. Wish I knew what the answer was, aside from feeding them a kernel at a time. I don't even think they taste it when they eat it. So if you have a dog that eats really fast, in my opinion, these bowls don't change a thing.

review/summary: Good for a ravenous pug
review/text: Since adopting a second pug (Henry), our first pug (Beatrice) suddenly became somewhat food aggressive. She'd eat her food as fast as possible then try to hoard in on Henry's dish. We started feeding her about thirty seconds after feeding Henry, but watching her shiver with anticipation started to feel cruel. This bowl seemed like a good solution - and it is. This bowl slowed down her eating dramatically. We now feed them at the same time and Henry finishes first! One thing to note, however: because Bea really has to get in there to get the food (kibble mixed with wet food), the wet food would get stuck in her wrinkles, requiring some post-dinner clean up.

review/summary: The secret energy source: Eternal water from New Zealand
review/text: This water is very nutritious because it is pure clean water from an aquifer deep under the NZ mountains. The water's actual age is 50,000 years old.  Water with a low ph increases the acidity in your body overall.  It causes loss of energy, increase in fatigue. But water with a high ph like Eternal Artesian Water from NZ is high in alkalinity.  This is good for cell absorption and overall good health.  I lost my right kidney and adrenal gland in a skiing accident.  Could not get my ph level to the best level for my situation until I started drinking Eternal Water.  Very easy to drink a few bottles everyday.  If you are looking for a natural way to increase your stamina and improve your overall health significantly, then drink 2 20 oz bottles per day and you'll feel great. You really will!  Good luck.

Or whatever he wanted to do. :]
