review/summary: Only thing I use on salads now.
review/text: Love this stuff!  Great flavor, easy to put on your salad.  Plus, benefit of vinegar and almost no calories.  I also have the raspberry flavor and the olive oil mister.  Both are great products as well.<br />Recommend, Amazon has a good price.  I am unable to locate in local markets.  Very glad to see here.

review/summary: Excellent Quality - Flavor on the Weak Side
review/text: I'm on my third 5 pound bag of this CO2 Decaf Colombian coffee.  I obviously have enjoyed it.  The aroma and freshness of the coffee from Coffee Bean Direct is absolutely wonderful.  For some reason the beans also grind terrifically without any static electricity that usually sends other grounds scattering.  I like that.  However, after buying my third bag of the Colombian beans I think I will move on to another decaf.<br /><br />I don't know whether the Co2 process yields a weaker flavor or if it is just this particular roast.  I have found that a normal portion of ground beans in a drip coffee maker produces a rather watery and weak coffee, not nearly worthy of the amazing smell of the beans.  I keep using more and more coffee to get the most flavor out of the beans.  This seems to work ok for now, but I now use almost 50% more coffee than is normally called for.  I still like the brand though and look forward to trying another CO2 decaf roast from them next time.

review/summary: Wonderful aroma, perfect color and great taste
review/text: I was ambivalent about trying this or any non brand name coffee on the internet but decided to take a chance.<br />I have been buying coffee from web sites for years with great success, but increasing prices and lesser quality started creeping in. I also blend 50/50 decaf and wanted a chemical free decaf to use. This product was just the answer I was looking for. Big bag , yes. But when opened the fresh roasted aroma filled our house. As with anything worth having it is a little on the pricey side, but how many cups of bad coffee can you really stand?<br />Great product, great delivery and a definite buy again.

review/summary: Great Taste & Good for You
review/text: Have tried other black rices but they have not been whole grain nor organic. Plus the others don't have the slight nutty taste that this does. Because it is a whole grain you must cook it like brown rice - a little more water and a little longer cooking. Additionally this brand isn't sticky or as sticky as some normal black rice. Yes I know there is a Thai sticky black rice and that's OK but this brand isn't sticky so is nice for stir fry, have even used it in gumbo. Will be back for more soon.

Made the puchase for a diabetic because it is a low glycemic food item.<br /><br />I must say that everyone who I have shared the Black Rice with enjoyed it the most when it was cooked in a broth.<br /><br />I like the texture and taste with or without broth.  I must say that the health benefits of the rice is what I was seeking and have found in this rice.  Worth every penny that I spent on it.

review/text: I purchased this seasoning thinking it was the same as the McCormick fajita seasoning you can purchase in the little packages and I thought I could save some money by buying in bulk. Unfortunately it isn't even close to being the same as what you get in the little packages, the other 2 star review was right, it comes out just tasting like salt with no other real flavor. If you like the way the mix tastes that comes in the packages then stick to the packages, if you want your meat to taste like salt buy this or save some money and just use salt!

review/text: Although I don't disagree that there is a lot of salt in Fajita seasoning, I feel that this is what it is supposed to be.  We use it on beef, chicken, and other items we are putting into Tex-Mex and similar cooking.  To us it tastes good, is in a convenient package, and is reasonably priced.  We used to buy similar bottles of it from Sam's Club, but they don't seem to carry it anymore.<br /><br />Food products are difficult to review, because people's tastes are so subjective.  All I can say is that this spice is what we expected when we ordered it, and we are happy with it.  I don't doubt that people who make their own, from scratch, are able to suit their own tastes better than this bottle can.

review/summary: Nice unique natural flavor, High Quality beans
review/text: I am always looking for a coffee blend-- I don't like dark roast or any roast that is designed to cover the inferiority of the beans. This is a good one, because although I don't like flavored coffees (like hazelnut), I do enjoy cinnamon in my coffee every now and then. This roast is quite good, and perfect for anyone who likes a flavorful coffee and drinks it black, like I do.<br /><br />The cinnamon flavor is a delicate note, although when the coffee is actually brewing, the smell is powerful. If you put a lot of sweetener or other additives in your coffee, you may not be able to enjoy this coffee's natural flavor.<br /><br />I feel like this coffee is high quality, with excellent flavor. I don't get an "acidic" stomach afterwards, either. It would have been better if the beans were not ground, but I understand the convenience factor. The cinnamon flavor is natural, not artificial, so it actually tastes more like a cinnamon stick is in the coffee. A huge plus.<br /><br />Recommended!

review/text: I've been cycling my cats through a few different kinds of wet food, based mostly on convenience, and they devour them all. I ended up buying my cats some avoderm dry food, and they had no objection, so i was a little surprised when i plunked down a can of this wet food and they refused to eat it. After staring at it and glaring at me for a while, they finally deigned to lick the gravy off, but left the meat bits there until i cleaned them up.<br /><br />Honestly, i almost gave this a five-star review, because i've been wanting to wean my cats off the wet food for a while, but they love it so much. Since i started offering them this, they've stopped even asking for wet food anymore.

review/summary: Sweet Tasty Salt
review/text: I love this salt and only use salt from the Himalayan. Pink Himalayan salt has NOT been polluted by man like what you might find in other high quality gray salts since they come directly from the ocean (which are polluted). Pink salt has 84 minerals and is a HEALTHIER alternative for you unlike cheap, bleached, chemically added and altered, common table salt. Table salt is straight processed Sodium Chloride and does not have all the other minerals to "balance out" what your body needs. Using it will cause fluid to accumulate in your tissues causing blood pressure problems, joint pain and other issues. Use Himalayan salt instead and watch your blood pressure numbers reduce. There are two articles written by Dr. Joesph Mercola who is a certified holistic doctor as well as an MD. He writes on unadulterated salt being an essential nutrient for life.

Well, as you can imagine, I have tried pretty much every brand of ketchup and one brand that is always way over the top than the others on my ratings is Heinz Ketchup. What's even better now, is that Heinz 57 now has this easy to squeeze bottle. It is also very handy at getting that last ounce of red delight out easily. If you haven't tried this product yet, I encourage you before you waste another squirt of another brand that may leave your french fry tasting, well, tasteless!

review/text: First of all, there's no better condomit for anything than Heinz Ketchup. You can use it on anything and make the anything taste better: steak, hamburgers, soup, spinach, Wheaties - anything.<br /><br />My problem with the ketchup isn't the ketchup itself but the upside down bottle it's in. For Pete's sake - it's upside down! What were the Heinz people thinking?<br /><br />I'm a bit on the obsessive compulsive side and having an upside down bottle of ketchup in my fridge while everything else is rightside up makes me a little crazy. I tried turning the other things upside down so they'd get along better with the ketchup, but it was a disastrous experience.<br /><br />Thankfully, the upside down state of the bottle doesn't affect the taste too much. As long as I turn the food upside down before I put the ketchup on it, everything still tastes okay.<br /><br />I just hope this doesn't catch on with other bottled items. What if they start making shampoo bottles upside down? Then I'd have to turn my head upside down in the shower. Not only would it be uncomfortable, but I'd also end up getting water up my nose and I hate getting water up my nose.<br /><br />I just hope the Heinz people aren't connected with the Head And Shoulders people.

review/summary: Crying Over Spilt Soup
review/text: Somebody should have warned me that one of the Campbells enjoyed juvenile humor ala Three Stooges.  As the previous reviewer states, put it in the micro, turn it on and wait about 16 seconds for it to tip over.  I tried it twice, the second time I placed the can in a deep bowl and it still fell over.  I know I need to clean my microwave more often, but twice in 10 minutes is a little excessive.  This was the shortest Subscribe and Save on record.  Oh, if you want to know about the soup,  I couldn't tell you.

review/summary: soup is tasty BUTTTTTT
review/text: I purchased this as the winter months are upon us. However who invented the container that the soup is packaged in needs to go back to the drawing table.As the product is heating in the microwave,They tip over spilling the contents. So not only have you lost your meal but a big mess to clean up too. I have a case to use up so will just empty into a mug to heat.

review/text: Ever had a Warhead? These pack the same sour punch on the outer shell, but inside the shell Toxic Waste has a sour liquid! Very awesome and sour. You can actually pick these candies up at the Dollar Tree.<br /><br />But caution:<br />It's citric acid. Any type of acid burns, the sour you taste is not really a taste... as crazy as it seems, it's really a feeling in your tongue. Yes it's a good amount of citric acid in one piece, but you're not supposed to eat multiple pieces in a short period of time. You will actually burn a layer of skin-like-material on your tongue. Too much consumption can cause the tongue to bleed. It will heal quickly, as long as you don't eat more in the process of healing. It is true your tongue will actually shed flakes like sun burn. I know it's disgusting but it's how the body heals naturally. Hope this information helped you, or any else it may concern. (Mostly your tongues)

review/summary: Toxic Waste Candy
review/text: I'm a sour candy fanatic,and I heard that toxic waste was the most sour candy ever, so I ordered a pack. I was really excited because I love Warheads, but i don't find them extremely sour. I ate the toxic waste sour candy today, and I can say that Warheads and Toxic Waste candy taste very similar.<br /><br />Similarities of warheads and toxic waste:<br />More sour than most candy's<br />same flavors<br /><br />Differences:<br />Toxic Waste has a surprise sour center after it turns sweet, which is exciting<br />I could only eat 3 toxic wastes candies ( one after the other)<br />for warhead's, i can eat about ten before my tongue starts hurting<br /><br />In Conclusion, toxic waste is more sour than warheads, but nothing over the top<br />It still tastes very good, so if you love sour candy and want a little more sour flavor than warheads gives you, then buy it! =]

review/summary: Toxic Waste are the same as Warheads
review/text: Toxic Waste vs Warheads? They taste almost exactly the same except Toxic Waste has a sour core to it. Lemon is the most sour flavor. For [...] you get 12 containers with 16 pieces in each. 12X16=196!!!!!!!!!!!. Get Toxic Waste mainly because you get more than warheads and there is that sour core. The core however is no where near as sour as the coating on the outside.

These have a miniscule amount of sour taste, then get sweet immediately. Remember just because its sour to 1 or 2 individuals does not means it, should be HYPED up like this.

They are a individually wrapped hard candies, there is a coating of sour on the outside.... the hard candy itself is still sour, once you get to the center there is a powder sour center... awesome candy!<br />I thought looking at the picture the containers were smaller, but they are  a great size and I got about 12-14 candies per container, and there is 4 different flavors.<br />Watermelon<br />Black Cherry<br />Lemon<br />Blue Raspberry<br /><br />Great Buy!

review/text: These candies are slightly a little more sour than the Warheads candy. I am giving this product a 5 stars because it arrived in 2 days!!! The shipping is extremely fast and also this is a lot of candy, which is good because it gets addicting. I say you suck on them and when it gets smaller it has little holes in it that let out the sour part in the middle and then crack the candy so you can get more sour out of it.

review/summary: Fun Candy Item - Great Packaging
review/text: I've bought this item several times now to use as participation gifts for people attending seminars I've conducted. The packaging of this candy is great. The sour candies are individually wrapped and placed in yellow "toxic waste" barrels with what looks to be green slime escaping from the top.  Although the candy is labeled "ultra-sour", some sour candy enthusiasts have told me that they don't think it is as extreme as what the company is marketing it as, but that the flavors are good.  I do plan on purchasing again.

review/summary: Less sour, but tastier
review/text: First off, the hype that Toxic Waste candy is more sour than Warheads is simply not true. Warheads are covered with a pretty thick layer of malic acid that is<br />as sour as you can get. Toxic Waste candy has a very thin, much less dense layer of malic acid which is not nearly as intense and it goes away far too quickly.<br /><br />Other than that, Toxic Waste is a much better tasting candy. The initial "sour shock" only lasts for seconds, but then the sweet flavors creep in along with it making it much easier to handle. The flavors of the sweet part of the candy are far better than Warheads are. I also love the hollow centers filled with a sour powder. The powder is not overwhelming, but very tangy and good, especially mixed with the flavors of the last remnants of the sweet part of the candy. Overall, I believe the flavors are better than Warheads, but the initial malic acid "sour shock" is not nearly as intense, hence the reason for 4 stars and not 5. Don't let that stop you from buying it though. The price is right and is the taste is good!

review/text: You'll love it if you like sour candies. My girlfriend and I found out about this candy on a road trip when we googled "what is the most sour candy?". I couldn't find it anywhere, so I ordered a case off amazon. It turns out that you can buy individual packs at dollar tree. Anyway, they're super sour and have a good variety of flavors (six, I think). The flavor isn't quite as good as warheads, but they are a more intense sour. In fact, you can only eat one or two without temporarily damaging the inside of your mouth. They are also a lot of fun to give to friends and family to watch their reactions when they try their first one.

There is a little sourness for the first five seconds, and then it's gone...completely gone.  It tastes like a regular hard candy after that.

review/summary: Toxic Sour? NOT! 100% of random test subjects ate them
review/text: We bought the Toxic Waste candy, based on the entertaining label, promoting the extreme difficulty in eating them. (Indicating it is nearly impossible to keep it in your mouth more than 30 seconds) Warnings abound on the label, severe discomfort, "don't eat more than one", etc. I am used to super-hot hot sauces, where warnings are justified, so expected extreme sourness.<br /><br />We set up a Christmas eve game, with 35 adults and kids, with a video camera, to record the event. Most of the people either never eat, or hate sour, so this was going to be fun! First person was an adventurous woman "guinea pig" ... Ate it without a wince. Next person, a young boy, who easily ate it and proclaimed, "warheads are much more sour".<br /><br />Some people winced for a few seconds. Only 2 had problems getting past the initial sour. After a few seconds, the sour goes away. Another discovered, if you chew the candy, it is hardly sour. Even a 6 year old boy, who absolutely hates sour, ate one. Several people said the flavor makes a difference, speculating that the green apple was more sour than other flavors.<br /><br />While we had fun, it was very disappointing. I was expecting super-extreme, Umeboshi plum kind of sour, or worse!<br /><br />With a room full of people, from age 6 to 84, 100% ate the entire thing, with the kids eating them like candy. This may be sour candy, but it is NOT "Toxic Waste" sour.<br /><br />On the plus side, those who love eating sour, (mostly the kids) liked this candy, but it is just candy, not an adventurous challenge for the strong-willed.<br /><br />Sorry, guys, fantastic marketing label, but poor execution. I have no idea why our results were so different than expected, but we went through 3+ cans in an evening. We will try again next year, but I will try to find something *really* sour, something that at least 2/3 of the people cannot eat!

review/text: As a European and an absolute rye and pumpernickel bread fan, I have always snapped up any of the Mestemacher brand variety in the local store.  But it becomes increasingly hard to find.  Amazon seems to be the one source that can offer such specialty items.  My family and friends love it when I entertain with German dishes on special occasions and these make a great addition.  Also, it makes more sense to buy these in larger quantities such as the one offered, as they can be stored for 9 to 10 months.  Because of this quality, they can be part of someone's emergency pantry, too.

It tends to fall apart when used for sandwiches. This is good, but I prefer my bread not quite so sweet. I will probably order another flavor next time.<br /><br />It's funny how the picture on the package shows a romantic couple. It's not exactly something I would associate with romance!

First, it came with a shelf life dated 8 months after my purchase date, so it's going to keep a good long time. Second, everyone who tries it wants to know where they can get some, so I've given away as many packages as I've eaten. Delicious with meat, cheese, or fruit! I'll be back for more as soon as my stash runs out.

review/summary: Mestemacher Westphalian Pumpernickel, 8.8 oz Pack of 11
review/text: For more than 50 years have I had a craving for real good German Pumpernickel, but never found any till I went to Amazon.  What a surprise it was to find it there. Never thought of Amazon getting into food products.<br />Anyway.  this is the real thing, and the taste is undescribable delicious. Within one month I've ordered 33 packages of this product.  I told my daughters, and they too have ordered this Pumpernickel.  I'm so glad I found it.  All we eat now, my husband in the evening, but I for breakfast and in the evening ( we have sandwiches at night). I also ordered another type of Pumpernickel: Mestemacher Pumpernickel at 17.6 oz a pack of 12.<br />This tasts just as great as the smaller packages, only the slices are a bit thicker, but just as great tasting as the other.  We no longer eat any other bread, since this is truly the bread for good health.  I am so glad about Amazon now offering food products that are healthy and good for yu.<br />Thanks Amazon<br />Trudy K.

review/summary: Yummy - this is real bread, not a squishy sugar-filled slice of air
review/text: I'm eating my last pack as I write this and wanted to order more.  It's lunchtime and two slices with butter and sliced cheese will be filling enough for me. I've eaten it with lunchmeat, jam, honey, sliced eggs & mayo, plain Greek yogurt on top (really, the sweetness of the bread goes well with the tart yogurt).  Fabulous amount of fiber, no sugar at all.  Personally, I think it's a waste to toast it; it doesn't even seem like the kind of bread you can toast, but that's only my opinion.<br /><br />I feel the exact same way about their Whole Rye Bread and usually alternate them.<br /><br />If you have not eaten this kind of bread before, be aware that it is NOTHING like the usual stuff you buy here in the U.S., not even the artisan bread.  Thin sliced, very dense, slightly sweet, I guess from the rye.?  Full of flavor.<br /><br />Oh yes, I have had this pack for 18 months now.  It supposedly expired in December of last year (6 months ago), but I somehow forgot about it and am just now opening it.  Tastes as good as it did a year ago.  Might not be a bad thing for long-term emergency food storage, now that I think about it.

review/text: A friend recommended this bread because it is extremely low carb. (well, no wonder--the slices are so thin and small!)  At first I was not even sure I liked the taste, but it has definitely grown on me! However, it is so crumbly that I have not been able to use it for sandwiches and I am not sure how else to use it.  If anyone can enlighten me, please do!

review/summary: Top quality jarred fruit
review/text: Polar fruit tastes fresher than other forms of jarred/canned fruit.<br /><br />These are hard to find.  The big "W" once had a few varieties (apples, oranges, and mixed), but no longer.  The big "T" also had this brand for a very short time, and they also dropped it.<br /><br />My local CVS has apples only, and Walgreens sometimes has smaller cups in the promo aisle.<br /><br />Too bad shipping costs so much, but I guess there isn't a cheap way to ship such heavy things.  More than half of the shipping cost appears to be the per-pound charge, so buying several cases would only save a little.

review/summary: Made in China
review/text: I picked up a jar of Polar Strawberries yesterday that were being cleared out at Ulta Foods in Chicago.  The $1.50 price was very attractive as is the jar and the strawberries.  The flavor is pretty good in corn flakes.  Strawberries that have been soaking are going to be a little soggy and they will look a little different- not as bright, fresh etc.  Still, the packaging is attractive and the jar is heavy.  Given the weight of the jar I was surprised to find that they had been shipped all the way from China.  I'm not one of these confused people who thinks everything has to be organic (including soda pop), but I know this much: 1.  Avoid Chinese drywall  2.  Avoid Chinese Seafood  3.  It's probably safer to avoid food from China altogether.  Given that strawberries are included in the "dirty dozen" of fruits and vegetables that use large amounts of pesticides, I seriously hope the Polar is testing and keeping a close eye on the quality and safety of their products (fish and fruit from China).  Milk, eggs and poultry, are especially worth the price of organic, especially if you have young girls, given the documented early development due to added hormones.  But strawberries are another item that is worth growing myself or paying for ones grown without heavy pesticides.

This gallon jug is a godsend for those of us who tend to put hot sauce on everything. I'm the type of person that NEEDS to pour it on my food from a jug rather than shaking a little bottle at my plate.<br /><br />This gallon jug lasted me a long time and stayed very fresh. I never noticed a difference in the flavour or texture. Not that I would expect to, since I doubt much bacteria could reside in such a hostile environment!

When a bird poops on my head, I drink it. When I accidentally spill it all over my pants while giving an important speech to the board members of a prestigious company, guess what I do??  I DRINK IT!!!!!!!!  Also, it is good to throw in the faces of your enemies.  Their faces will not be able to withstand the awesomeness of it and they will run away in fear.  Overall, I would recommend Frank's Red Hot Cayenne Pepper Sauce- 1 gal. as a go-to product for any living organism looking for a good time, as it can be used as anything from a weapon, to a cleaning supply, or an anniversary present.

review/summary: Not for children--but works well
review/text: I bought one of these and one of the mana potions for fun--was going on a trip to meet up with some friends who would appreciate such items.  Here's what we all pretty much agreed on:<br /><br />Visual:  Small but very attractive packaging.  Pretty much exactly what you might think a health potion would look like in real life based upon many popular games.  Smaller than expected--but then it more easily explains how your character in World of Warcraft, or 'toon, could carry 40 in one backpack.<br /><br />Taste:  Also explains why your 'toon refuses to drink another one for several minutes, even if it means dying.  Dying is preferable as long as you still have the aftertaste.  Think cough syrup, only without the benefit of alcohol or drugs.  Very glad it came in 50ml bottles--one good sized swig and it's gone.  After a short period of time, however, one starts to think it wasn't that bad.  An appropriate support group could probably help with that mild problem.<br /><br />Effects:  Works as advertised per friends who drank it (I drank the mana potion).  They were able to stay up as late as they desired, were able to concentrate well, and noted no adverse effects the next day.<br /><br />Active ingredients: Per their website, contains 25 calories per serving, includes Vitamin C (100% RDA), B1 (80% RDA), B5 (80% RDA), B6 (1600% RDA), B12 (100% RDA) as well as caffeine and enzymes.  Caffeine content roughly equivalent to two Red Bulls or four cups of coffee.<br /><br />Bottom line: Works well, but based upon the caffeine I would not recommend for children or anyone else you wouldn't hand a pot of coffee to and expect them to drink it all.  Really shouldn't be listed in toys and games, but rather with food or energy drinks.

review/text: There I was, face to face with the fabled Gorlok monster with only 10 HP left.  A lesser man would have turned and run, but not me, I had a secret weapon.  The Gorlok lunged at me with his 12 arms flailing and his teeth gnashing violently.  I could smell the stench of death as his long talons narrowly missed my already tattered left arm while quickly I rolled to the side.  As the Gorlok was recovering from his voracious strike I slipped out my Health Energy Potion and downed it in a single, hurried gulp.  I could feel my strength being restored and much to my amazement my arm was fully healed!  Those magnificent bastards at Energy Drinks have done it again!  I sprinted towards the Gorlok, jumped high in the air and did a triple axel while coming down with all my force into the eye of the mighty beast.  The Gorlok let out a deafening roar as he toppled to the ground, dead by my hand.  I had finally saved the princess who was trapped in that dark castle all these years.  I approached her majesty and I'll never forget what she said to me, "Thank you Jeremy! But our princess is in another castle!" Son of a...

I bought them for their appearance as a fun gift for my LAN group. One of the bottles had leaked in the box and the smell alone should have warned me to not drink it. But live and learn. The one benefit I got out of the purchase was that the bottles can be filled with water and food coloring to use as game props or displays. They are aesthetically pleasing to the eye when you hang them in a window with the different colors catching the daylight.

review/text: This stuff is absolutely atrocious.  I'm a huge fan of energy drinks - generally Monster or 5hr Energy are my top picks, but this seemed interesting enough to try out.  The stuff is awful - it doesn't wake you up at all, has no kick, tastes horrible, and worst of all it has made me feel terrible pretty much all afternoon - very bad stomach ache.  I would not drink another bottle if somebody offered to pay me the $20 I spent on a six pack of the stuff.  (Also, aside from ebay feedback, this is the first online review I have written of ANYTHING - nothing has motivated me enough to sign in and complain about it before, ever, and I buy far too many things for my own good.  Hopefully that speaks to how awful this stuff is.)  Buyer beware - you could spend half as much money to pay a stranger to kick you in the stomach, and have the same experience.

I'm very comfortable with energy drinks, usually drinking a few Monster or Red Bulls everyday but with this I could actually feel my heart pumping. I don't know if I was more energetic or not but it was a interesting bottle so I wasn't really in it for the stay awake aspect. Considering five hour energy runs about $2 at a gas station, this is comparable in price and effect.

review/text: Health and Mana Potions are very good. They don't taste that good, but you get used to it, and one starts to think it's not that bad after the first or second potion. It is Very Fun, a little educational being in that it teaches that Caffeine and the ingredients are... Energizing? It is Durable, so long as you don't poke it with something or toss it around. The Bottles used to be Glass and people started making Molotovs, so they made them Plastic. I give this a 5 Star, it does what it says and is very good!<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Wanna stay up? Need Energy? Need to Focus? Get This. Now.

review/summary: It tastes worse than cancer
review/text: If you're going to buy this, don't drink it! This is like eating a kilogram of sugar and then getting kicked in the face by a horse. The packaging is attractive, but that is about it.

review/summary: A Death Knight's Drink of Choice.
review/text: I bought the Health and Mana potions on a whim while in Hot Topic last weekend. I figured it would be pretty good, since I was planning a WoW marathon the next night. I tried it and realized why they came in such small bottles. It tastes awful, Red Bull tastes better and even that is pretty gross. I say it is a Death Knight's drink of choice because it tastes like your going to die. However, it certainly kept me going way past my normal breaking point. I suggest this in a pinch and for alittle whimsy fun - but for everyday? Stick to coffee and Mt. Dew.

review/summary: Does a body good!
review/text: Wow this one whisks up really nicely! Granted I am getting better at whisking and making a nice froth on top of my matcha but this one was easy peasy! I have noticed some matcha flavors mix more easily than others for some reason and since I do make more than one matcha many days its not just due to me being better one day versus another. This one whisked up to a very full forth quite easily! I note this because I know froth is really something many of us struggle with especially when we are new to matcha so I wanted to make a note of it for those of you who may feel deflated by not getting a good foam. Get this one and you can feel stellar! lol<br /><br />Now as for taste, I am not one who has had a lot of passion fruit in their life, other than in smoothies I have got from smoothie places and those are usually so riddled with sugars and other fruits picking out the passion fruit itself was a little difficult especially not having passion fruit in and of itself.<br /><br />Now I get to taste real passion fruit! Yay!<br /><br />It has a bit of this natural rind like flavor similar to that you sometimes get in a mango or papaya. Fruits I do have personal experience with. I like it though - it really compliments the natural grassy like flavor of the matcha base! And contrary to the smoothies I have had its not that sweet. There is a tart flavor to it but not bitter. It tastes REALLY healthy, and while matcha is always healthy sometimes I feel guilty having my dessert like matcha lol although I shouldn't such as my favorite butterscotch mathca makes me feel like I'm cheating haha this one makes me feel like I am really doing something good for my body and trust me my body needs all the help it can get!<br /><br />The aroma of this one is really quite nice! It is very eye opening and even if its only a mental thing I sure can use that in the mornings!<br /><br />There is the after taste of the rind like flavor but the passion fruit flavor makes my mouth water for more, literally, as if the juices itself are pulling out the watery mouth sensation! Its strange but nice. Its like having a mouth full of juicy passion fruit!<br /><br />So I drank half of my matcha straight, then added some sparkling italian water and some sweet cream non dairy creamer to make an italian soda and OMG goodness! The flavors ERUPT into a juicy fruit gum sensation which is similar in some ways to the brandy matcha I am going to review next! It is different though as the brandy also has alcohol notes to it whereas this one does not. This is like the virgin variable you give your kids while you have the brandy one haha. Except this has that lovely awakening rind flavor in the background that lingers in the after taste.

review/summary: Fruity, light, refreshing
review/text: I've had "passionfruit" flavored teas that tasted nothing like passionfruit. Red Leaf's passionfruit matcha is not one of them. This delicious tropical fruit flavor definitely shines alongside the base matcha. I prefer this matcha cold, though I plan to try it hot come winter. It'll be perfect for summer daydreaming, because there's something about the flavor of passionfruit that screams summer. It's well captured in this matcha. The flavor isn't heavy, but I do find that just the slightest touch of milk/cream really rounds out the cup. Another hit from Red Leaf!

review/summary: The best fish sauce ever!
review/text: I was raised on this brand of fish sauce. To me, Tiparos is the greatest brand. You can't get any better than this. Add a couple squirts to raw eggs, then scramble them in a pan, and eat with fresh, hot, white rice. That's quick and delicious. We use fish sauce to cook all of our Thai meals and marinate beef and chicken for various dishes. For me, there is no other.

review/summary: The Drippings of Fermented Rotten Anchovies...
review/text: ... were a basic flavoring ingredient in the cuisine of ancient Rome and Etruria, used as widely as The Chinese use soya sauce or the Americans use catsup. It may be something of a surprise that the same fish sauce is one of the necessary elements of the Southeast Asian cookery, from Burma to the Philippines. The clear pungent liquid is called 'ngapi' in Burmese, 'nam pla' in Thai, 'nuoc nam' in Vietnamese 'yu chiap' in Chinese, and 'patis' in Tagalog. Tiparos is a good brand, and this is a proper price.<br /><br />The Thais serve "prik nam pla" as a condiment on the table for every meal. It's simple 'fish sauce' with chopped Thai chilis, those little hot devils, and chopped coriander weed, commonly called 'cilantro' in parts of the USA. It's indispensable. You can judge the authenticity of a Thai restaurant by whether you are served prik nam pla automatically, or have to ask for it, or can't even get it. In the latter case, you are ethically authorized to walk out without paying your bill.<br /><br />Likewise, any Thai or Vietnamese cookbook that doesn't discuss the uses of fish sauce would be better reserved for starting campfires.<br /><br />As I said, the Romans used the same stuff, which they called LIQUAMEN. My guess is that as the Empire was transformed by immigration from the north, especially via Gaul, fish sauce was replaced by sea salt and rock salt. The Haida, Tlingit, and Kwakiutl peoples of the Pacific Northwest used the oil squeezed from candlefish for a similar taste treat. That oil was so valuable as a trade item that wars were fought over it.<br /><br />Soya sauce is NOT an adequate substitute, whatever your Betty Crocker cookbook says. But now you can get fish sauce anywhere you choose to live. I'm still getting accustomed to the implications of internet shopping. Imagine this: I can get a novel by Roberto Bola&ntilde;os, a DVD opera by Monteverdi, and a bottle of Tiparos nam pla, all in one package delivered to my door by the US Postal Service.
