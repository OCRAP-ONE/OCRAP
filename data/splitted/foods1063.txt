review/summary: Weird taste bad smell
review/text: If you are Russian and looking for good buckwheat kasha - don't buy that one, it's totally different thing. It smells like medicine and tastes weird, not like regular simple buckwheat. If you are the person who decided to try a buckwheat first time - don't buy that one, you will be disappointed and never know what a tasty meal it should be.

review/text: Better than Wolff's Kasha. I grew up eating Kasha and it is an easy to prepare healthy meal. Bob's Red Mill has a great selection of all things GRAIN. If you are ever in the Portland area you should check out the store/restaurant. Great vegetarian selections as well as meat eater stuff.

We use a lot of Bob's products, and it's much cheaper to purchase them in bulk at Amazon than at our local grocery store.  I've also used this combined with chickpeas to make my own falafel from time to time.

review/summary: It is not "KASHA"! Tastes bad, do not waste your money.
review/text: I am from Ukraine, so I grew up on buckwheat, and I know how "Kasha" is supposed to taste and look like. This is not it. Once you cook it, this Kasha looks like goo, not like Russian Kasha is supposed to be - very flaky, with each piece of wheat separated. It tastes pretty bad too, like it got burnt or something. No matter how much butter or salt you put in, it still tastes bad. The only reason I bought this product because it was organic and I did not want to buy it on Russian website (was afraid of them stealing my credit card), but now I have to, because THIS is not good.

review/text: Our two 4 month old kittens absolutely LOVE this food. We tried Wellness kitten dry food, and they weren't too crazy about it, but they immediately took to this stuff! Not only do they love it, but we love it because it has extremely high quality ingredients and is healthy for them. We also love it because it is very reasonably priced for a premium quality food. We feed our kittens both this dry food and Wellness and Merrick Before Grain wet foods. When they're older, we'll definitely be moving on to Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul, because we couldn't be happier with this food!

review/text: I was using Wellness Core for my six month old kitten and have been using CSFPLS dog food for my three adult dogs. The price for the CSFPLS kitten food was cheaper than what I've been spending for Core so I thought I'd give it a try. So far, so good! The kibble is 'x' shaped which makes it easy for her to pick up and she runs to her bowl as soon as I give her her breakfast. I'm super pleased with the ingredients and am happy she took to it so well. I am hoping that it treats her as well as the dog formula has treated my other furkids. Soft coats, shiny eyes and good activity levels!

review/text: This is a fantastic cereal, and is higher in fiber and lower in sugar than most. Not sure why it's only targeted at kids, as it's CHOCOLATE CEREAL!!! We're all adults in this household and we LOVE it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it sells out in a couple of days whenever Amazon carries it, and then they don't restock it for months at a time. I don't get that at all. I would subscribe to this if I could, and I won't buy it from a Marketplace seller, as their prices are ridiculous. ($10 a box??? Seriously?)<br /><br />So come on, Amazon, and get it together. You should have plenty of this in stock all year round, like you do the honey flavor (which is dull, dull, dull).<br /><br />Cereal: 5 stars<br />Amazon: 0 stars

review/summary: High-Quality cat food that looks like food
review/text: My cats love most of the TikiCat flavors, so this is mostly a review for the overall line of cat food. There's a great review on a blog called Green Little Cat (no affiliation), with a picture of what's inside the can.<br /><br />All the food looks like food! There are rice grains and pieces of calamari, and in the flavors with prawns, there are tiny little prawns! Not just some weird mush! The chicken flavors are shreds of chicken, and the salmon flavors are chunks of salmon where you can actually see the flaking that fish tends to have. It's really great. All but one or two of the flavors even qualify for low-phosphorus diets (for urinary stones/certain renal diseases)! The highest protein flavors are Ahi Tuna, Chicken, Chicken+Egg, and Chicken+Salmon. The others are still very high protein, but they do have other stuff, too (like rice, greens, etc).<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy feeding this to my cats (alongside Orijen dry food), because I can actually see the ingredients, the company is exceptionally responsive to customer questions (they will send you a comprehensive nutritional breakdown if you email them!), and they really pay attention to nutrition.

review/text: This is the best GF bread out there!  So delicious and perfect for a sandwich, french toast, etc.  But I get it $2 cheaper at Trader Joe's.  Single loaves are $4.99.  Too bad Amazon cant give you a good deal to buy a case of 8.  Oh well, I tried.  But do try the bread- so good.

review/summary: Saves my diet!
review/text: This is very tasty bread.  I am one who cannot forego my bread and we've all heard how bad it is for us except for Udi's gluten free Whole Grain!  As most have said, it makes the most delicious toast and if you didn't know you would swear it was just a good old fashioned style white bread.  It's not.  It's healthy!  I wish they would figure out how to eliminate the holes though.  I took some photos the other day of two slices from a loaf I bought and the holes were huge.  It is so delicious that even a loaf full of holes is better than no loaf at all!  It's so expensive too but a luxury I must have.  I buy it locally from my grocer's frozen food section and forego all other bread.  I used to buy artisan breads and bagels, etc but no more since I learned to read labels and know what to look for.  Thanks for the hint and I will look for it at Trader Joes or Costco to try and save a little money.

review/summary: Oh UDI's you have brought sandwiches back into my life
review/text: Wheat makes my kidney's hurt, gives me migraines, and does unpleasant things to my stomach. I have tried other gluten free breads and they were not worth the money I spent on them. This however is incredible! It did not even taste like gluten free bread. It tasted like bread. I've been making my chicken, swiss, and tomato sandwiches every day and they're so good.<br />  The only thing that could make this bread better is a better price. It's $5 a loaf and some of the ingredients are not expensive ones. I hope the price goes down.

review/summary: Best Gluten-Free Bread Around
review/text: I will buy and eat Udi's white bread in a pinch, but I like the whole grain bread ten times better. The taste is great and it doesn't fall apart, although I still prefer to make open-faced sandwiches so there is no crumbling at all.<br /><br />I had that problem with air holes that one reviewer mentioned on my most recent loaf. I will definitely be more careful because, at Udi's prices, I'm not interested in paying for air, but I had that happen to me once or twice back when I was eating regular bread, too. Air holes happen.<br /><br />I do think this is one of the first things, with doctor/nutritionist approval of course, that a person should grab after they discovered a gluten allergy or sensitivity. The first thing you think of is, "I'll never be able to have a sandwich, toast, or French toast again!"<br /><br />But, this isn't true. You can still have bread and eat well.

review/summary: Delicious but not Whole Grain
review/text: This bread does taste like regular bread. Regular over-processed "wheat" bread you'd buy for two dollars at the grocery store. It keeps good for a while and makes a dynamic sandwich but it doesn't offer that wholesome, whole grain experience I really miss. The label says it has 8 grams of  whole grains per serving--about a third of the total grain content.

review/text: I really appreciated being able to buy Gluten Free Udi's Bread online through Amazon with free shipping.  The closest store where we can purchase this bread is 30 minutes away.  This saves us so much time & effort.  Just be sure to purchase it 1.5 weeks or so before you need it (processing & shipping time) and you'll be very happy with your purchase.  The bread came very nicely packaged & still a little cool.  Thanks again.

review/text: Udis is by far the best gluten free bread on the market, in my opinion. At over $5 per loaf in the stores, the cost of this case isn't bad, but be prepared to wait a while for shipment. I've ordered this twice, and each time it has taken almost 2 weeks to get to me. The bread stays fresh, but sometimes, it's easier just to go to the store.

review/text: Due to a severe gluten allergy, I was baking gluten-free bread for my granddaughters school lunches.  On a trip to Trader Joe's in Danvers, MA, I found Udi's whole grain loaves for $2.99. She loved it for sandwiches, but not so much for toast. Although it's almost a half-hour drive, it'll be worth it to make the trip once a month to stock up, and save me the time and trouble of dragging out my heavy mixer to bake from a mix.  Amazon is great for a lot of things, but not this item at twice the price for 8 loaves.

You've made it possible for us gluten free folks to enjoy eating sandwiches and toast again!

review/summary: I can have a sandwich again!
review/text: My gluten intolerance was utterly depressing, no more pasta, no more sandwiches. (The Bionaturae GF pasta is pretty darn good and as a bonus it doesn't get mushy like those rice based pastas-but that's another review for another day).<br /><br />I live near Berkeley and there are health food stores, organic this and that, farmer's markets, etc, but I never found a bread worth bothering with...I can't tell you how many loaves of other breads simply wound up in my compost bin. Then a neighbor told me about Udi's...wow! great texture, doesn't crumble, and a truly tasty flavor.<br /><br />Sometimes it's the simple things in life, a sandwich is one of those things, and thanks to Udi's I can go there again.<br /><br />As to another review that mentioned poor service from Udi's, I had just the opposite experience, I got a loaf that had a giant air bubble in the middle of the loaf-several pieces were crust, a little bread and a hole the size of a golf ball through the rest of the piece. I emailed the production/batch info and they mailed a coupon for a free loaf.<br />(They'd had a production issue where this was happening a lot- now corrected-no more problems.)

review/text: This bread is like a peasant bread, and I love peasant bread. I keep it stored in the freezer and take it out as needed, thaw it in the microwave or toast it. I did not purchase thru Amazon since the price was extremely high but I got it thru Glutenfreely.com and they had it on sale and the more you bought the less you pd so I bought 6 loaves at $4.75 a loaf. They sent it to me in a cooler with dry ice and I received it within a couple days it was great. Plus free shipping to boot it always pays to shop around especially for specialty foods, but definitely the best bread I have had yet!! Thanks Udi's!!

review/summary: gluten in udi's
review/text: "My family have been gluten free for 10 years now. I also work in the natural products industry at the senior level and have seen the deception first hand. Gluten is quite a serious issue as when it is consumed the villi are inpaired and other nutrients needed to be assimilated for other necessary body functions are not absorbed. It has caused my family other serious complications from eyesight to teeth and mouth difficulties and it has to stop. I am writing this reveiw because I am tired of feeling powerless while companies are prospering at the expense of our health. I follow a paleolithic diet for the most part and recently for my birthday decided to have a turkey sandwich on Udi's bagels. Well they are most certainly not gluten free. EVEN IF LESS THAN 5ppm still makes someone sick. My entire mouth broke out in canker sores and I got a white spot on my front tooth that has not gone away because the gluten sensitivity is preventing iron absorption. Udi's is making millions of dollars and people are getting sick even if they are not sensitive enough to feel it. We had the gluten tested at the doctor's and yep sure enough it was UDI's bread that we reacted to. I hope this review helps at least one other person not get sick."

review/summary: Buyer be aware
review/text: I am very unhappy and saddened to report that I will not be dealing with this bread company again and neither Amazon unless there is no alternatives. I bought a case and stored them in my kitchen which is cool. The bread was fine however within 1 week I opened a second loaf and noticed mold inside one of the loaves. I then checked the rest and also saw mold on every one . I checked the instructions again, the storing option was that it could be placed on your counter top , I contacted Amazon who referred me to the seller by e mail, I had a reply to say the bread should have been frozen immediately, this IS TOTALLY UNTRUE and not stated on the labels. Anyway I then filed an A-Z claim to wait over another week for Amazon to send me this short curt mail saying it was not covered under A-Z , I was shocked as they knew why I was claiming this item and now to say not covered is very poor service indeed.  I contacted Customer Service and instead of empathizing with me Paula in customer service started to tell me about expiry dates and her mother works in a bakery ! I don't need to hear that as I know all about GF bread and have been buying it for years. I could not even get to speak to a Manager after requests to do so and then was insulted with a $30 promotional voucher which I declined. I spent thousands with Amazon year after year and to be treated this was is very sad , what happened to your legendary service. I also notice that Amazon send me an e mail saying sorry they cant help and thanks for your business , truly amazing they just don't value their best customers<br /><br />Bottom line don't deal with this bread company as they don't live up to their promises and try to shirk their responsibility as the label is misleading and false

review/text: YUMMY!!! Arctic Zero is delicious & has great nutritional stats.  Even though I never thought I'd eat the entire pint in 1 sitting, I did, but at least I didn't feel tooooo guilty.  I've tried the Choc & Choc PB.  Now I'm going to order the Vanilla.  Still on the fence about the Strawberry Banana.  Only negative is the price, but if you consider the 6 containers you get for $46, that's a little less than $8/container or pint.  Even if you eat 1/2 pint at a time, that's only $4.  You spend more than that buying an ice cream at your local ice cream shop, plus you're saving a ton of calories.  You can add on fresh fruit, whipped cream, etc. & make your own sundae's for a fraction of the calories.  GREAT STUFF!!!  Love it!!  Also, the containers were still frozen solid when they arrived!

review/text: OK. I don't write many reviews but just had to on this one. I ordered the Choc and Choc PB because I just HAD to try it. I LOVE ice cream but I'm also trying to lose weight and a serving of regular ice cream just doesn't get it. I will admit, the first time I tried it, I wasn't thrilled. It was icy and the flavor didn't do much for me. Then I read a review that said you should let it sit at room temp for a while so that it softens some. OMG!!! What a difference!!! Creamy, creamy, creamy. All of the icyness goes away and it's so smooth and creamy I was amazed. I've gone through 3 of the pints now and I like it more each time I eat it. Maybe it's an acquired taste or maybe it's that going in I KNEW it wasn't going to taste like real ice cream (really, how could it?) but I was looking more for the texture and coldness of ice cream, not necessarily the flavor. One thing I do if I want it a little sweeter is I sprinkle a couple of teaspoons of PB2 (powdered peanut butter - GREAT STUFF!!!! and it's sold on Amazon) on the top and mix it in. It sweetens it just enough and it only adds about 20 calories and lots of PB flavor so it's worth it. I could also never eat a whole pint of this at one time. After eating about a 1/3 of the pint I feel stuffed. I'll definitely be buying this again!!!

review/text: After reading the reiews I was hesitant about buying this because people were comparing it to a frozen protein shake and not real ice cream. I've never had a protein shake so I didn't know what to expect. Also it seemed like the makers of Artic Zero were reviewing it because the reviews were a bit TOO nice to be true. I took my first bite of the chocolate and immediately likened it to the taste and consistency of FUDGESICLES! The peanut butter is more of a peanut taste to me but still good. Frankly if it was 1000 calories like it's Ben & Jerry's chocolate counterpart I would not be satisfied with it. But since it's 128 calories a pint this frozen treat is more than satisfactory to me! I'll buy it again.

review/summary: Full pint of icy ice cream for under 130 calories!
review/text: The taste, the chocolate and chocolate peanut butter taste the same.  The only difference is on the first spoonful of the chocolate peanut butter, you taste a faint hint of a peanut.  This product though is great if you like to eat an entire pint of slightly icy ice cream.  As for the packaging, I had mine deleivered to NJ in August.  Granted we are having a cool summer but the products were still frozen upon receipt.  The only downside to the packaging is they use styrofoam peanuts (I hate) and the box the six cartons comes in looks like it can hold 12 (why not use a smaller box, no peanuts or put 12 in one box without the peanuts?).

review/summary: It's great
review/text: It really, really is great. 128 calories for an entire pint? Enjoyed every bite of it. The chocolate is tasty, choc PB is more of an acquired taste, but good nonetheless. The only disappointment lies in the sugar content...not low sugar. Ooops. Not quite the ideal product but close enough. I'll still buy it - if they stock it in a local store. Can't keep ordering this online, it's pricey. Try Carbawhey ([...]) a similar soft-serve by the same makers of Arctic Zero in stores near you - you can get an entire quart for [....]max, about the same price as ordering Arctic Zero online.<br /><br />**Would love to see a variety pack with all 4 flavors (not currently offered)...

review/summary: Not for people with discriminating taste
review/text: I tried the chocolate peanut butter and the strawberry. Neither was appealing, at all. The chocolate PB was the worst, and I didn't even consider it edible. The strawberry was not quite as bad, but it had the overwhelming flavor of the whey protein. It was obvious to me that both were water-based, and the flavors are very artificial tasting.<br /><br />Ordinarily I'm ok with low-calorie foods, but Artic Zero just did not taste good to me at all.

review/summary: Great if you have a sweet tooth yet watching your caloric intake
review/text: I have a HUGE sweet tooth yet I try to watch my calories to maintain my weight.  When I heard about Arctic Zero, I knew it was something I needed to try.  After trying Whole Foods and Fairway markets with no luck, I decided to bite the bullet (regardless of the expense) and purchase from Amazon.  The products showed up on my doorstep just several days after my order was placed, despite an estimated delivery date that was almost 2 wks away).  They came perfectly frozen. I ordered the combination chocolate and chocolate peanut butter -- 3 pints of each. My personal preference is the chocolate -- it reminds me of Haagen Dasz chocolate sorbet. I crush a few walnuts and have a delicious & satisfying treat. I plan on trying another flavor. To me the price is a bit high but worth the time & gas I save trying to find it!!!

review/text: Arctic Zero is a tasty frozen treat with very low calories and sugar.  Definitely better when left out of the freezer to melt a lot.  It is icy, not creamy like low fat ice cream, but for 128 calrories in the whole pint, what can you expect?  Good alternative to have on hand when watching calories, but too expensive for quality of product.

review/summary: Chocolate!
review/text: I've tried all the Artic Zero flavors, and the Chocolate is my favorite! I can eat it a whole pint at a time. The chocolate Peanut Butter is "OK", but I wish they could make it actually have a peanut butter taste. I couldn't tell there was really any peanut butter flavor at all. The Vanilla and Strawberry Banana I can't even eat on their own. I've used them in a smoothie to save ice cream calories, but don't think they are worth the extra expense. So, I've stopped buying anything but the Chocolate flavor, which I re-order every few months. I've also tried the Pumpkin Spice flavor, that one bombed too. I just ordered their Chocolate Mint Cookie flavor and can't wait to give it a try! I have high hopes for that one! But if your on the fence of what to buy, try their Chocolate and Chocolate Peanut Butter combo and decided which you like better from there.<br />4 stars, because it doesn't have the "real" ice cream texture you would expect, but for the calories it helps me get my ice cream fix! And I like that they let you try more than one flavor at a time!  I wish they had a full on variety pack though...<br /><br />P.S. sometimes there are occasional problems with some of the pints arriving a little soft and melted. After sticking them in the frezzer to re-freeze, when you go to eat them they can have an icy texture. This is unfortunate, because of how expensive they are. I don't want a single bit to go to waste! But since I can't find them locally, I have been willing to just deal with it.

Arctic zero is so tasty that I fooled my sister, who are very anti-anything diet/low-cal, into thinking it was regular ol' fashioned ice cream. The chocolate flavor is great and mixes well with the vanilla. I use the strawberry-banana in smoothies since it is a little sweeter and not as creamy/rich as the others. Can't say anything else other than it's definitely worth trying!

review/summary: big european coffee
review/text: is what my husband said this coffee reminds him of.  He likes a mid (not strong) taste.  I don't drink coffee hot. My idea of coffee is a wonderful smell in the morning that I will make and add to a latte or I guess I mean a chocolate/coffee smoothie that I make at home.  This one suits that bill.  It is a full flavor to me or strong.  I believe it would even make a second cup if I so desired.<br /><br />Would I pay a huge amount for it?  No, I think this coffee is relatively expensive. There are only 15 pods in the box and it happens to have Marley on the box.  Is that the reason for the cost or is pod coffee just expensive?<br /><br />Since I don't have a pod machine I boiled a cup of water and added it to the pod in a cup with a spoon holding it down.  Worked well for me.<br /><br />Good coffee but not worth what they want for it.

I added a little light cream and it was very good, be careful with the cream it needs very little.  My first cup I put to much light cream and it overpowered the drink.  I would buy this again, it is something nice to give as a gift or serve to company.

review/summary: Roast is too dark for  a Yirgacheffe
review/text: While the roast is  described  as medium it is actually a nice but slightly bitter dark roast which is completely without the promised floral notes that are expected in a good Yirgacheffe Ethiopian coffee. A true medium roast would have preserved the floral and fruity notes that are present in a good Yirgacheffe.  Otherwise, this is an OK feel good coffee for Senseo and Senseo compatible pod cofee makers.  It is both Fair Trade and Organic certified and promotes or sponsors the coffee kicks charity while trading on the Marley name.  However, there is a lot of necessarily sturdy packaging which blunts the organic and sustainable claims for me.  As is standard for Senseo pods, each pod has only enough coffee for 5-6 ounces of strong  coffee. Use two for a mug if you prefer strong coffee.

Honestly, I didn't really catch the hints of exotic floral and berry they advertise which is just as well as I enjoy a basic coffee. The single serving pods are handy but you can also use a couple in a regular machine and it works just fine as well. If you're environmentally concious, it is free trade certified and organic.  Partial proceeds are also donated to the charity kicksforcause.org.  Overall an enjoyable cup of coffee with decent flavor.

I had to tear the pods open and use just the coffee and that way, it is EXCELLENT coffee. Rich and dark, I really like the flavor. My only complaint is, no, they're not easy to open packets, I have to use scissors and really, does it need all that wasteful packaging? But the coffee itself is very good, though I don't know all the fancy words for describing coffee, I like strong flavor with caffeine, usually choosing medium roasts and this fits the bill.

review/summary: This Coffee is Not Bad
review/text: This package of Marley coffee contains a bunch of "pods" designed for pod coffee makers. Look them up and boggle at the prices. I do not have one so my first try was with my French press - the purest way of making coffee. I put one pod into it and poured in a large cupful of almost boiling water. After poking it around for a while and leaving it to sit, I got a blackish coffee which tasted a bit weak.<br /><br />For my second attempt I cut open two pods and emptied the ground coffee into the press. The resulting coffee was quite strong, but as a quasi-European (English) that's the way I like it.<br /><br />What to say about the flavor? It was mild (no harshness) and fairly pleasant. The coffee in Denny's restaurants is better though.

review/text: Brewing Machine: Philips Senseo<br /><br />First thing I noticed was that the packet contained noticeably more coffee than my Senseo pods.  I thought great, I can use just one to brew my double serving cup.  Wrong, very weak when brewed that way.<br /><br />Second, tried to brew two servings at once, but two pods were much too large to fit in the two serving Senseo pod holder.  So, I used the single pod holder and brewed one cup at a time.  What a hassle.<br /><br />Taste wise, the coffee is okay, it tases sort of weak for my tastes and doesn't have a lot of flavor, and the price per pod you might as well buy Star Bucks (or favorite coffee house coffee).  I will keep using my Senseo dark roast pods which I think have better flavor and are much cheaper.

review/summary: Needs more instruction but we figured it out
review/text: Marley Coffee is an interesting product which comes in a tasteful display box/dispenser, and proves that one can have fresh rich coffee just about anywhere without dedicated coffeemakers or pod machines.<br /><br />Maybe the "One Love" variety is meant for two cups per "single serve" bag, or perhaps one is supposed to do something more than to "Stir It Up" little darlin', as recommended on the box (in homage to the song.)<br /><br />There wasn't instruction on the packaging on how to get the brew right with these large "tea bags" of coffee. The only thing clearly marked was which side of the bag should be faced down in the cup.<br /><br />The coffee has a good taste, but the first bag I tried brewed up so strong it gave me the jitters. Good thing there are 15 individual plastic-sealed bags in the dispenser. My husband fiddled around with them because he likes an occasional cup of joe in the afternoon but doesn't want to brew up a whole pot.<br /><br />I credit him with coming up with the "spoon test" to figure out when the coffee was at the perfect strength. We use a 16 oz. cup because the circumference of the bag is rather wide for our 12 oz, and we pour boiling water over the bag which rises to the top as the cup fills. Then we wait for it to steep. After a couple of minutes, he takes a spoon and starts lowering it into the cup just until the bowl of the spoon is completely immersed. When the brew gets dark enough, the bowl of the spoon disappears except for the edges, and then it's done.<br /><br />It's a quality product, convenient, and can save on electricity, as well as not wasting coffee and good water, or adding pods to the landfill. And it's a really nice way to remember Bob Marley, a man of nature from Jamaica.

review/summary: Strong and bold flavor, fits in Philips Senseo machines, and it is organic!
review/text: We are still on our first box of this, but so far we love this coffee at home. We have a Senseo coffee machine, and we were unsure if it would work for us, but it fits perfectly. The coffee is organic, no artificial ingredients like some of the other ones have (including the ones recommended by Philips!) Size wise, each coffee pod is quite thick, I would equate it to 1.5 times the Senseo ones. Smells and tastes great. I am not the biggest coffee drinker, but the ladies in the house love it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Good earth-friendly coffee but too much packaging
review/text: I am a coffee lover and usually enjoy a strong cappuccino in the morning.  I tried this coffee and was impressed by the aroma and flavor.  It is not too strong but has a good not-too bitter flavor.  I really like the pods - so much less mess but these are all individually wrapped!  I know a lot of coffee pods/packets are to keep in the freshness but maybe organic and fair-trade coffee manufacturers could care a little more about the waste produced from individually wrapped items.  Needless to say, I did enjoy my cup of coffee and would buy this product again.

review/summary: Not the best Ethiopian coffee I've had, but pretty darn good for a coffee pod
review/text: Executive summary: not as good as a traditional cup of Ethiopian coffee, but definitely the best coffee pod coffee I've ever had.<br /><br />Several years ago I walked into an Ethiopian restaurant for the first time.  The food was good, but the coffee was the best coffee I had ever tasted.  It was rich and dark and so incredibly flavorful.  It didn't pack a killer caffeine punch, which is good, because I drank a whole pot by myself.  I love coffee and drink it daily, and I've never found another coffee that came close, except at another Ethiopian restaurant.  It's my understanding that coffee originated in that region, which may have something to do with it.  (If I'm wrong, sorry--I'm not a historian.)<br /><br />While I looked forward to this coffee, I was pretty sure it wouldn't be as good as the coffee in the restaurants, made in the traditional way.  I was right.  Still, this is the best coffee I've had from a coffee pod.<br /><br />It was rich and dark, as I expected.  The scent that was released when I opened the packet was wonderfully deep and complex.  The first cup, made from the pod, was very good, if a little bland.  The smell while it brewed turned a little unpleasant near the end, for some reason, but it faded quickly and wasn't present in the brewed coffee at all.<br /><br />I took out the coffee press for the second cup, and cut open one of the pods.  (I don't recommend this, since the grind is far too fine for a coffee press.)  The coffee made this way was much richer and more complex, and the scent while it brewed was sweet and tempting.  Two cups of this coffee didn't give me caffeine shakes, so caffeine levels seem about average.<br /><br />If it matters to you, this is Fair Trade Certified coffee and some profits are donated to Kicks For Cause Foundation, which supports youth soccer programs.

review/summary: Wonderful aroma, delicious taste
review/text: This conveniently-sized pod fight perfectly into my Senseo machine, and brewed up a first-rate cup of coffee.<br /><br />From the moment I opened the recyclable packaging, the wonderful coffee aroma assured me I was in for a treat. The flavor didn't disappoint. Smooth, complex, and rich, with a subtly floral note, this coffee was head and shoulders about my usual Senseo pods, and in my opinion, far superior to the burnt and bitter notes of a certain overpriced but popular coffee chain.<br /><br />A fair trade product that donates funds to a children's soccer charity (rather than turning a blind eye to child labor), Marley Coffee is a morning cup you can enjoy with a clear conscience.<br /><br />Normally, I drink more tea than coffee, so I don't consider myself an expert, but I know what I like, and for me, Marley Coffee was definitely a treat. I received a free sample for review, but I'll definitely be purchasing my next box.

review/summary: OK Coffee
review/text: This is decent coffee. Nothing special. It is not very strong or distinctive. Does not have much "jump." Nothing wrong with it either, except for the fact that for a coffee product that prides itself on being environmentally sensitive, it is being sold in single pod packages that are anything but. Time to leave that sort of contradiction behind.

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: Marley Coffee One love Organic is dark, rich and flavorful with good mouth feel and a medium roundness of tone. Not bitter, but there seems to be almost a salty undertone to it, that does speak of Jamaica and Blue Mountain although the label does not claim it is Blue Mountain coffee. These packets are about one normal scoopful, and can be used in single serving coffee makers but I put one in my 2-4 cup espresso machine and it was fantastic.

review/summary: Nice Taste, Good Company
review/text: This coffee comes packaged in individual filter pods, as shown in the product image. I don't have an individual pod coffee maker, so I put this in the filter area and set the pot to make a single cup, and it worked fine. Unlike other pod coffees I've tasted, which are weak and watery, this has a good coffee flavor. A nice medium blend, it has a unique flavor, and isn't bitter/acidic. However, those looking for a dark or super strong jolt should try one of the other roasts. Overall, a good, easy to make, cup of coffee.<br /><br />According to the box, the Marley Coffee company's products are organic, USDA certified, Fair Trade, and child labor free. In addition, some percentage of the profits are donated to children's soccer programs.
