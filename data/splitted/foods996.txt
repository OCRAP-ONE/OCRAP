review/text: I'm not quite an insomniac -- but I definitely don't fall asleep as quickly as most people do.<br /><br />This product doesn't knock you out but rather relaxes you just enough.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to anyone who has problems sleeping but doesn't want to solve them with hardcore prescription drugs that leave you feeling sluggish the next day.

review/text: I have had problems going to sleep for most of my adult life, so any time I see something that isn't a sleeping pill to try out, I try it.  I was surprised that this stuff actually worked - I've used it a number of times, and it has been consistently effective at helping me fall asleep.  Very happy with this product.

review/summary: best sleep ever
review/text: I usually need a xanex and 5mg of melatonin (ingredient in this drink) to fall asleep, and to stay asleep. Having an anxiety disorder I am always "revved." I tried Dream Water, but the effects vs cost weren't worth it. I saw this on display at my local grocery store and figured what the heck. I was asleep in no time, slept the whole night and was relaxed in the morning and refreshed. Whatever combination this has works.<br /><br />And I did take it with the xanex, so it did not cause problems with my prescription meds - although I wouldn't recommend it, I'm just saying I didn't have problems.<br /><br />I came to Amazon to order since the store I found it at hasn't had any - even my kids look for the orange bottle! Being a better parent is an awesome side effect. :)

review/summary: Great for insomnia, not addicitve.
review/text: This is an amazing product... in the past, I'd switch between Ambien and Lunesta and  still fail to sleep when things got bad. Even though Lunesta could knock me out sometimes, I still wasn't myself.<br /><br />But any time I have a really bad night where I can't sleep and worry I might fall into that cycle again, I can pick one of these up and know I'll sleep a full night without any major side effects.<br /><br />It's a pretty simple thing... sugar-water with melatonin and magnesium. And it works. I wish they could be cheaper, but it's a lot better than getting on sleeping pills.

review/summary: Great Natural Sleep Aide
review/text: My husband has an injury that he received while in the Air Force. He has a pinched nerve between L4 & L5. He has been on pain medication for the last 14 years. However it would give him temporary relief and he would not be able to sleep. Do due his type of job he would only take the medication at night. I found this in the gas station on day and had him try it. Instead of taking his pain medication (the bottle tells you not to take anything else with it) he drank a bottle and within 30 minutes he was out cold for the whole night. He has never slept so well in years. I now buy this off of amazon because he drinks this every night. Its easier than stopping at the gas station everyday.

review/summary: Better than sleeping pills
review/text: I have insomnia and back pain and this product helps with both during the night. It takes me a very long time to get to sleep and my back pain tends to wake me up at night, and then once I wake up I am unable to fall back to sleep. I have tried countless OTC and prescription sleeping pills without much success. Pills do not make me drowsy enough to go to sleep and after taking them I feel groggy and sluggish in the morning.<br /><br /> With Neurosleep after drinking it I fall asleep within 30 minutes and I sleep though out the night! I am not woken up by back pain either probably because I am in such a deep sleep. I do wake up a little tired still but it does not last long and I feel refreshed throughout the rest of the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately it is a bit pricey for long time use but I have incorporated it into my budget because this product is amazing! I will recommend and I will continue to buy it.

review/summary: It works AMAZING
review/text: I love all the Neuro line of drinks but this works by far the best. Sonic works too (about the strength of a cup of coffee) but this is truly amazing. I was very skeptical at first but I drank it and fell asleep in a half hour. I was dead like a rock. Not only does it make you tired, but the quality of the sleep is greatly improved. It is very hard to wake me up in the morning but I woke up feeling great! I blinked my eyes for about 30 seconds in disbelief that I didn't feel horrible and press snooze 10+ times. I drink a Neuro sleep before bed and a sonic with breakfast for days with an important test or something like that. Oh, I forgot to mention you can't become dependent on it; the ingredient that makes you sleep, melatonin, has no risk of dependency.

review/summary: Best Sleep I've had in Months!!
review/text: First I did not purchase this product through Amazon, but did purchase one bottle for the price of $2.49, which is in keeping with the current Amazon price of $30 for 12 bottles with free shipping.<br /><br />I did purchase this particular product in the Neuro line at a local Sheetz store.<br /><br />I tried it last night and in the 15 minutes that it took me to drink this beverage I started to relax, and more importantly, the millions of thoughts that are normally zinging around in my head just sort of shut off.<br /><br />I went to bed after drinking it and almost immediately fell asleep and slept for all but 6 hours.<br />This was a beautiful thing as I usually take at least 1 to 2 hours to fall asleep each night and only sleep on an average of 1 to a max of 3 hours each night.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone, and for convenience of finding it, as long as the price remains the same-the $30 per 12 bottles, it's definitely worth it for a good night's rest.<br /><br />Just remember that with any over the counter supplement, you should always check with your doctor before trying it, especially if you, as I am are on additional medication for a separate issue.

review/text: I was apprehensive about buying this drink. I have tried the Neuro Sonic and Bliss, and have been satisfied thus far. The Sleep drink really surprised me. It tastes good and works! I started to feel drowsy within 30-45 minutes, and later could barely stay awake. Now, it doesnt make you crash out like prescription sleeping pills, but definitely makes you sleepy. I stayed asleep longer than I do when I just take regular Melatonin. So...I really liked this drink and will continue to use it until the company changes something....

review/text: I was skeptical of how this would work, dependency, yada yada yade. I just decided to try it today, and I have to say, it works really well. A few minutes, I just suddenly hit a wall. I only drank half the bottle or so, but it's potent. Not only am I having trouble focusing on my homework, I now want to go to bed and it's only 9 o'clock at night. It doesn't taste too bad nor too great, so I don't mind drinking it. It doesn't taste like medicine, which I thought it would. I would recommend it if you work late at night, or just need to fall asleep in a pinch.

review/summary: Night Shift Godsend
review/text: I bought a single bottle at my local store to try. I fell asleep before I finished the bottle. I bought a few more bottles but when I went back a few days later they were out and didn't have any for a week so went on line and happily found it here. Not only do I fall asleep with no problem if I wake up in the middle of my sleep I don't have any problem going back to sleep. I'm not groggy when I wake up either. I have been working night shift for 20 years and have tried a lot of things to help sleep over the years and this is hands down the best. Worth every cent. Buying from Amazon means I never have to worry about being out since my local store couldn't keep it in stock. Obviously, I wasn't the only one who thinks it is a necessity.

review/summary: Did me pretty good
review/text: I'm a fairly regular user of Ambien, but right now, can't afford my prescription.<br /><br />Desperate for sleep, I happened upon this at the local grocery and decided to give it a try.  I had already napped for a bit earlier in the evening and was afraid it wouldn't do anything, but to my surprise, it worked fabulously. I slept for a solid straight seven and feel well-rested this morning.<br /><br />One thing I noticed, which Ambien doesn't really address, is that it relaxed my body.  I've noticed when I'm trying to sleep that I have to consciously have to relax my body, and while I did still have to do this last night whilst waiting to fall, this drink seemed to encourage the process, and it wasn't the usual battle. (I'm going to have to talk to my doctor about this and see if there isn't a better sleep aid for me).  I think I fell asleep in less than half an hour.<br /><br />I've read a couple of reviews elsewhere (not on Amazon) where people said they were concerned that drinking such a large amount of liquid before going to bed would cause them to have to get up to go to the bathroom, so I drank mine over about an hour/hour and a half before I wanted to sleep and peed before I went to bed.  No problem.<br /><br />Perhaps this would also solve the problem for those who say they got a headache from it.  People's body chemistries are different, and if you're not consuming these substances on a regular basis, that could explain the headaches.  One person said they even vomited after drinking it, which I think indicates he probably chugged it down and his body said 'what the hell is this'?<br /><br />I do feel a slight relaxed, tingly, 'body hangover' today, but I can live with that since I'm such a nervous nellie anyway.  I do not think I would use it everyday because it is expensive. At two something a bottle, that comes out to $180 over a three-month period, and no guarantee that the effect wouldn't wear off after awhile; whereas I can get ambien from an outreach pharmacy for $35 per 90 days.<br /><br />But I would definitely use it in a pinch.

review/summary: This Works
review/text: I really like this Supplement Drink for Sleep. Rarely, do I have trouble sleeping. BUT, when I cannot sleep, it is because my legs hurt and want to break into a dance, and my head slightly aches, and I toss about, and my mind is racing along thinking of tomorrow's problems. Then I read, then have a warm glass of milk, then, give in and drink this. Why did I not use this first? The cost.<br /><br />But, once I use it, wham. I fall asleep and so not wake up until morning.<br /><br />How to use this effectively:<br /><br />1. Take a cold bolttle of Neuro Sleep.<br />2. Chug a Lug the Whole Bottle. It is easy to do so. The bottle seems designed for it.<br />3. Lay down.<br />4. Mentally, temporarily, banish your cares.<br />5. Go to sleep.<br />6. Awake refreshed.<br /><br />I have used this off and on for about a year. I have finally learned that it is not unbelievably pricey considering the results. So, now, I go for the Neuro Sleep first thing. I drink it all and sleep well.<br />Drinking that amount of fluid just before bed seems like a really bad idea. But, it has never bothered me. I have Never had to get up in the middle of the night because I drank the Neuro Sleep.<br /><br />So I recommend it to anyone with a sleep problem. I can get myself into a fret that keeps me awake for 48 hours. But this beverage nips that in the bud and I go off to slumber land. I give it 5  stars for reliability and 4 for cost. Use it and sleep well.

review/summary: It works
review/text: I stumbled upon this drink last week at the grocery store. My wife had been having some trouble sleeping, so I thought I'd buy a bottle just to see what happens. I made sure that I put it in the the fridge so that it was nice and cold for when she tried it. We were sitting around watching TV just before we went to bed, and she decided she'd give it a try. After about 15 minutes she said she was feeling it. She had only drank half of the bottle, but said she felt very relaxed. I decided I would drink the rest of the bottle, and within about 15-20 minutes I was ready to go to bed too. I had to get up very early the next morning, but it didn't seem to give me any lingering effects after I woke up. I would recommend giving this a try, especially if it means that you can lay off the presciptions.

review/summary: Works great for me!
review/text: I've struggled with insomnia for the last 20 years or so. It was always impossible for me to fall asleep, I just did not get sleepy at a normal time. I tried all the tricks, changed what I ate and consulted many doctors. Nothing helped. Pills would work fine for getting me asleep but made me feel so bad the next day it just wasn't worth it. I'd reached a point where I just gave up and was suffering through my life on 4 - 5 hours a sleep a night. Then one day I found Neuro. I was at a gas station on the way to spend some time at my mom's. I always struggle sleeping at other people's houses, more so than usual. The bright pretty orange bottle caught my eye, I read the label and had to give it a try. Imagine my surprise when I was able to fall asleep at a decent time! Even better I felt fine the next day. Luckily I found that amazon carries it in bulk so now I can keep stocked up for when I need it. The nice thing I found is that I don't always need a full bottle, sometimes I can just have half a bottle and it's enough to make me sleepy. This is a truly miraculous find for me, I'm so grateful.

review/summary: Blessed Sleep
review/text: I am one of those people that find it difficult to sleep after a particularly stressful day, and I would wake up around 3 am and my brain would go into gear, and I had to take naps just to make up my lack of sleep.  I tried this NeuroSleep and it only takes a half of a bottle at night, and within a half an hour I am dead to the world and I wake refreshed when I want to.  Worth every penny spent.

review/text: This is amazing!  If you haven't already tried it -- you gotta! I Initially bought this because it promoted brain functioning, I didn't think it would actually give me peaceful sleep. I have always have a very hard time staying asleep.  Usually I wake up around 2 am, tossing and turning for the rest of the night.  with this beverage, I am relaxed before I go to sleep, and I stay asleep all night!!  I wake up in the morning refreshed.  I only drink about a third of the bottle before bed, that's enough for me. It contains Melatonin, which for some may interact with pharmaceuticals.

review/text: I found the Neuro drinks at my local grocery store and decided to pick up a few different ones. This one I picked up due to difficulties I have falling asleep(usually takes about 2 hrs even if I am tired). Neuro Sleep knocked me out within 30 min! I had to order a case. My fiancee has used it a few times when he is stressed out from work and he will be ready to pass out with in 15min! I honestly have to say if you have trouble sleeping you should give Neuro Sleep a try!

review/summary: Sleep at last
review/text: I was at the local gas station really late last night (well, actually really early this morning) and decided to pick one of these up. I was tired but could not get settled to sleep. I got home, popped it open, drank it and in 30 minutes I was OUT. This is totally rare for me because I don't sleep well and I sleep very lightly. I slept like a rock after drinking this and I will most definently be picking up more. The taste wasn't amazing but it wasn't aweful either, reminded me of diluted Tang but when I was drinking it, I couldn't get enough of it.

review/summary: Helped me sleep, until it made my heart race
review/text: This is a product I doubt I'd normally have tried, but a hotel we were staying at provided complementary bottles of it in the room. My son had opened and tasted it the first night; I didn't want it to go to waste, so I drank the bottle. And I slept very well that night, falling asleep within half an hour of drinking the Neuro Sleep and getting a solid eight or so hours sleep. Since it worked, I tried again the next night and that worked well, too. I then used it for a third night and woke up with my heart racing at about four in the morning and it took two or three hours to get back to sleep.<br /><br />I have a history of leg cramps. In the past, a friend had recommended I take a magnesium supplement to fend off the cramps and it had worked. But a few days after starting with the magnesium regimin, I started noticing that my heart would periodically start racing. It took me a couple of weeks - getting more and more concerned about a possible heart condition - before I connected it to the magnesium. I stopped taking the magnesium and within a few days the racing heart effect had disappeared. In the morning after my third night with Neuro Sleep, I looked into the ingredients and, sure enough, Neuro Sleep contains magnesium, to prevent muscle cramps.<br /><br />I won't take Neuro Sleep again, because I'm apparently sensitive to the magnesium in it. If you don't have a bad reaction to magnesium, though, this product may be for you. As for me, I may start mixing a homebrew cocktail of Melatonin and 5HTP, the other active ingredients, because I really did sleep well after drinking this.

review/summary: I can't believe this works
review/text: I was very skeptical of this product, but I purchased it since the Neuro representatives were so friendly. As per their warning, I did not try it until I got home that evening.<br /><br />I sat down at the computer and started chatting with a few out-of-state friends and my husband, who was also out-of-state. I opened the bottle and started absently sipping, as I would the ever-present glass of water on my desk. Nobody was curious about what I was drinking (through virtue of Google's Hangout) until I said, "Whoa...I need to stop drinking this." I was halfway through the bottle, and my head was feeling heavy. Upon inquiry, I showed my friends the bottle and they looked it up. Being the geeks we are, they recited the ingredients and laughed, "Of course this is going to make you sleepy!"  I retaliated, "I didn't read the label because this stuff NEVER works!"<br /><br />Well, it does work.  And I didn't experience the groggy hang-over I get from Tylenol PM. If they'd sell in glass bottles, this line would be perfect.

review/text: This product gets 4 stars because it ZONKED me to sleep. However, I have been having issues with sleeping only a few hours at a time. I know most of sleep is psychological and I'm trying to figure that out. So it didn't help with keeping me asleep like some of the other people claimed it did to them, but WOW it kicks in at about 15 min after consumption and it hits you like a ton of bricks. I am weaning off of a lot of sleeping medication so I was looking for something natural. This product can give you that- 'i'm ready for bed' feeling that I don't get too easily!

review/text: Like everyone on here I always have a hard time sleeping. Maybe 2-4 hours a night. I hate sleeping pills and have tried everything natural. The first time I tried this I was soothed into peaceful sleep. I had really awesome dreams too. Slept 8 hours. The 2 most important things about this drink<br />1. I actually slept through the entire night (which never happens)<br />2. I didn't feel groggy at all in the morning.<br /><br />I use it once or twice a week now. The store near my house just had them on sale for $1.99 a bottle! Good deal for a good night's sleep.<br /><br />You should seriously consider trying this if you have trouble with sleeping.

review/summary: It doesn't seem like it should work.... but it does.
review/text: I was skeptical of this when I came across it at FreshDirect.  I mean . . . it's a drink.  I've tried prescription sleep pills (which make me groggy the next day), melatonin (which doesn't always work) and OTC medications (which don't always work).  After reading the reviews on here, I figured I would give it a try.  Well, after a few months, it is now the only thing that reliably puts me to sleep and makes me refreshed the next day.  I suppose the ingredients just work with my body chemistry in a way that other supplements and drugs just don't.<br /><br />After having several sleepless nights when I ran out, I finally bought a monthly delivery subscription.  I might not trust homeopathy and holistic medicine as a whole, but you can't argue with results.

review/text: So much better than pills or tea.  This has a natural Melatonin hormone.  I was skeptical, but I tired one for an evening and it worked great.  So much in fact I bought a case.  If you are looking for a good night sleep this is worth a shot or a bottle rather.  After drinking the tasty liquid you will feel a bit sleepy - just lay down and then Wham!  See you in the AM.  No groggy hang-over feeling and some pretty nice dreams too.  Give it a try - I highly recommend it.

review/summary: It does work to help you sleep, but...
review/text: No doubt about it - this stuff puts you to sleep very quickly, however it caused me to have a pounding headache. I noticed the headache about 10-15 minutes after drinking it. I didn't particularly mind at first since I was half asleep anyway (which was a big feat in and of itself). This product also doesn't last the entire night, so I woke up 4 hours later and the headache was worse. Nothing would ease it. It was a strange headache - like a sore, pounding feeling would best describe it. I put a warm compress on my head, took my Ambien and was off in la-la land for the rest of the night. In the morning, the headache was still there, but not as bad. It was gone by noon.<br /><br />I tried it 2 nights later to see if it was a coincidence and the same thing happened. So, for me, Neuro Sleep isn't worth it. It could possibly be a contender if it kept me asleep for at least 8 hours, but it doesn't. Looks like I need to find something else to help me get off Ambien.<br /><br />(Also, the taste is not particularly great either!)

review/summary: Trouble Sleeping? Neuro Sleep is the answer.
review/text: I first tried the Neuro drinks from a local gas station. Bliss was the first one I tried, and it was amazing how well it actually worked (but that's for another review); so, based on that knowledge, I was more than happy to try Neuro Sleep.<br /><br />I've always had trouble getting to sleep. I will go to bed and lie awake for over half an hour every night. Not necessarily enough to be considered an insomniac, but certainly annoying. I'd always tried to find a fix. Tylenol PM, warm milk, etc. Nothing ever got me to sleep any quicker. Until now.<br /><br />Neuro Sleep is something you drink about 20 or 30 minutes before bedtime. It tastes great (has kind of an orange-y taste to it), and isn't carbonated so it goes down quick if you want it to or are thirsty. Within a few minutes, you begin to feel a little drowsy. By about 20 minutes, you're ready for bed (assuming, of course, this is a normal bedtime; if you drink it in the middle of the day, I don't expect it would put you to sleep like this). It lets me get to sleep right when I want to.<br /><br />All my friends always tell me the Neuro drinks are just placebo effect kinds of things, and they're not really doing anything. Well, I did some research, and Neuro Sleep is armed with 3mg of melatonin, which is a chemical naturally produced by the (normal) body to help put you to sleep. So this one, at least, really does work.<br /><br />I recommend trying it out from a gas station before laying down the money for a case, but hey, I eventually caved in and got myself a case, so maybe you will too.

review/summary: great and risky combined
review/text: Haven't slept for 6 months due to bursitis and back. Tried this once, and it worked. The problem was the next day I was so tired I felt faint. It doesn't say how much melatonin is in it...and that can be risky as it can ruin your body and make it ineffective on its own production of that. I would suggest half a bottle. Serving size should say 2 not 1. I think they don't have the formula right yet.....need to make it only last 8-9 hours....not 20, and should post the level of ingredients. Aren't they liable if they don't? What are the long term effects? I've heard magnesium can cause heart racing.  ??  Has this been tested wisely by FDA?? I hope this is a safe product. I will try it for a week and then decide. I hope I am not risking my health...the site picture of the developers makes me worry....they look kinda creepy and not very professional. Also have heard reports of headaches from this. I just got one at 7PM, and I took this at 11:30PM last night. Still very tired as if I was drugged. Feel faint. Seems dangerous to me...but will try more out of desperation. Half a bottle this time. I am 325Lbs and wonder how this would affect a petit person! There also should be warning labels about taking this with medications, etc....  I have been taking anti inflamitory medicine Dyclofenac. This can make you a bit dizzy. It doesn't for me....but maybe this Combo is what caused the drugged feeling. I see groggy complaints from others though! You should not feel groggy the next day but refreshed instead. The affect of this lasts too long!!! Many feel groggy the next day. This product has great potential...but they need to organize it better with proper Info. and the formula---This could be dangerous to some. I can see lawsuits coming. It feels like when you take 3 Benedryl. Too powerful for shelf product. Bottle should state 2 servings, not 1! I paid $2 at Vons and would not pay more---too pricey if you have to use it all the time. I suggest putting it at $1.59 ea.---you will make more profit due to volume.

The last few months I've ordered from Amazon through the subscribe and save insteaed of getting it at my local gas station.  I use to get sleepy within 15 mins of drinking a bottle, even half.  Now I can drink a whole bottle of this one and it does near nothing.  I am very disappointed.  The new packaging is a plastic cover for the entire bottle, it use to be imprinted on the bottle.  I get it if its to save money, I just wished it was the same product!

Nyquil knocks me out, I need 6-8 hours of free time to sleep with it so I didn't want to take my chances with this.  45 minutes after I finished the bottle I felt loopy and needed to sleep.  4 hours later I woke up with a massive head ache.  It knocked me out big time, but now I have a bad head ache.  I may keep a bottle in the fridge for a long night, but there's no way I would drink this on a regular basis, my head hurts way too much now.

Neuro, at $30.00 for a 12 pack of 14.5oz bottles is just $2.50 each, but I get "580%"! more product for two extra cents. That would mean Neuro is only 43 cents per 2.5oz compared to Dream Water's $2.48. This is a no brainer price wise. If it works as good as the reviewers say then it's a homerun!<br /><br />I will update after I receive my order.<br /><br />Update: Found some at various stores and it works as advertised...Homerun!

review/summary: Insomniac here. This is good for non-major sleep issues for sure.
review/text: I am very (VERY, VERY) familiar with all sorts of sleep meds and other items. Just as a background, I've had severe insomnia since I was a child. I have used OTC things (Melatonin, Diphenhyrdamine, Unisom, Magnesium, calcium, Valerian, chamomile, etc) and several scripts (Ambien, Trazadone etc) and I'll be honest, wine :)  I feel the wine works the best but is the most expensive. I get off/on again results with the OTC items, especially Valeran and Melatonin combined.<br /><br />So, last night I skipped the OTC stuff and drank this Neruosleep drink. First, the taste was not pleasant, it was like a vitamin drink..a strong one. I had no issues drinking it at all, but it's not like 'mmm, this tastes yum.." After about 20 minutes, I had that groggy feeling that sooo many get sooo easily, all their lives. I LIVE for that groggy feeling and spend a lot of money chasing it!<br /><br />Ultimately I was awake most of the night, but the groggy feeling lasted about an hour. I think at this price point, this would be a good once-in-a-while grab, kind of the nemesis for Red Bull :D  For hardcore insomniacs like myself, it's meh.<br /><br />I hope this helps!

During the entire class I felt really drowsy. strange considering I didn't drink much of it. I was also eating sweetarts, so when I started to get a headache I thought it was cause of to much sugar. After class I got home, drank the rest of the bottle and crashed before midnight. which is very rare for me, so I was happy and continued to ignore my headache. I slept for about 5 hours before I woke up with an even worse headache. I've had headaches like this before when I was younger but this one was slightly different. Like, I can't really explain it. My stomach wasn't to happy either. felt like i had to puke. I took some naproxen sodium (all i could find) and went back so sleep for another 4 hours. I woke up feeling totally fine.

review/summary: It does... something.
review/text: Picked this up at a CVS ($2.79) because I needed to wake up early in the morning for a meeting, which meant going to sleep earlier than usual. I'm a very small girl, so I drank half the bottle. It was a pleasant citrus flavor, and I started feeling the effects after 8 minutes. After 20 minutes, I was in bed because my body was starting to feel limp (which I guess is what people mean by "relaxed" in all these reviews).<br /><br />That was the extent of it though. My mind was still racing, worrying about meetings, deadlines, work, an upcoming interview, etc. All the while, I couldn't roll over because my body was limp and it felt like too much effort to move. I still ended up lying in bed awake for a couple of hours (which is standard for me).<br /><br />Waking up was a terrible experience. I felt groggy and could barely get myself going. That could have been a combination of the lingering affects of the melatonin and the lack of sleep from lying awake at night. Not sure if this is something I would invest more money in.

review/text: I was really excited to try this. Saw it at a gas station and picked it up along with the neuro bliss.<br />It didn't taste like butthole to me like it did to another reviewer, however, it didn't do the job.<br /><br />I took the drink around 11pm and I did feel something soon after. I was drowsy and relaxed, almost like I drank some wine or smoked.<br />I was happy that I was feeling this way because I figured that this meant I'd be going to bed pretty soon. I got in bed, and immediately, it all went away.<br />I ended up being awake till 430am.<br /><br />Disappointed. At least it didn't taste like ass tho.

review/summary: Great Hard to Find Low Salt & Low Fat Chip
review/text: Usually, if you see a low salt chip, the manufacturer amps up the fat content. Conversely, a low fat chip is usually overloaded with even more salt than the manufacturer's regular product version. With only 2g fat and 26 mg sodium per serving, the Guiltless Gourmet Unsalted Yellow Corn Tortilla Chips offer a rare combination of both low salt & low fat. Plus, they are very tasty when used for dipping.

review/summary: Seneca Apple Chips
review/text: It has been 2-3 years since we last bought these apple chips.  Our recollection was of a nice crisp apple slice with the crunch of a potato chip.  The cinnamon sugar had a slightly sweet taste.<br /><br />So when our box full of these apple chips arrived we all grabbed a bag expecting a great treat!<br />How disappointing... 2 months later they are still setting in the pantry.<br /><br />The chips are still crispy.  Other than that, the taste is bland and you have to eat around that hull which surrounds the seeds when the apple is still an apple.  Now that the hull is dried and sliced, it is very easy for the smaller kids to choke on, so we don't dare to even give this to the toddlers.<br /><br />On the good side...  these are very expensive and we will save alot of money by not buying any more!

review/summary: I love this product!!
review/text: This is a fantastic product.  I even use it for regular wheat bread.  Everything pops right out.  I used to have so much trouble with my pumpkin bread sticking using the regular Spectrum canola oil spray.  I found this by chance locally one day and it was really expensive but so worth the money.  Then I couldn't find it anymore. I once again turned to Amazon and there it was.  It was through a third party vendor.  I NEVER use a third party with Amazon.  I like dealing directly with Amazon and whenever I read complaints  it is usually complaints about third party vendors.  Well, I was so desperate for this baking spray with flour that I was willing to purchase it from coloradobargains.  Even with the shipping fee it was still  less than what I paid before and more importantly I could actually find it.  I was very happy to get six cans.  I expect by the end of Christmas baking I'll need more and I definitely will purchase from this company again.  The price was great, the shipping quick, the product fantastic.  If you bake, this is the product for you.<br /><br />While this is not organic, according to Spectrum's website they don't use GMO products even in their non-organic line.

I don't let it soak too long; so there is a plenty of flavor over and over as I make additional infusions. I used hot water and the resulting tea was not bitter; but smooth. This is a good buy for the price. The leaves are not curled or rolled; but flat.

review/summary: Won't cook a turkey without this!
review/text: I had never made a turkey before and I certainly knew nothing about brining so when I found this product 4 years ago and decided to give it a shot. This brining mix (combined with cooking the turkey upside down so that it's self basting) ended up being the absolute best turkey that any of my family and friends had ever tasted! I have now used it 5 times with the same results. The breast meat is so moist and full of herb flavor, you'll be blown away! It's a simple process to make the brining mix, prep the turkey and get it in the fridge the day before you plan on cooking it. The instructions say that you can take it out of the brining mix and leave it in the fridge for up to 24 hrs before you cook it but I wouldn't recomment that. The one time I tried that it wasn't as good as before. I don't know why, but that was the only thing I changed so I wouldn't do it again. Time it so that when you remove it from the brine, it's going in the oven within an hour or two. Enjoy!!!

Yes, I admit that I usually add a little more salt, pepper and herbs but in the end they do taste very good. I initially was looking for the beans alone but when I read the label and since I only use brown rice now a days, we gave this combination a shot and for us, it paid off! I can cook all manners of legumes, beans, etc but hey, if a nice organic company wants to do it for a while for an acceptable price, why not? For sure 4 Stars or even higher, they are reliable fare but for a couple of weird reasons we ended up with 6 cases of different kinds so we are still figuring how are we going to consume so much since most of the times we are only 2 people. That is the beauty of canned food, I guess, that it does keep longer and well. 4 Stars!

So I say this crap works. It takes a few seconds to kick in, but it did.<br />(and I bet people are already thinking to themselves "yea yea, you probably work for the company") but I don't...I can't prove it...but I don't.<br /><br />I will probably be purchasing another bottle of this stuff in the near future.

review/text: I like this product, really I do.  Yes, I do notice that it acts like a little "pick me up" when I drink it.  Nothing drastic, but it's there and the feeling is pleasant.  Having said that, the price is just too much.  It's a drink, not medicine and I can probably find similar ingredients in a supplement for less money.  Drop the price, guys, and you will get more buyers!

review/summary: NeuroBliss works for me!
review/text: I'm sure that NeuroBliss won't work for everyone because people have different body chemistries.  I suffer with anxiety and depression, but I hate being on prescription medication.  So I'm always on the hunt for healthier alternatives.  I discovered the Neuro products through a friend and decided to try them.  For me, NeuroBliss is a miracle.  If I'm having a bad emotional day, even just a few sips of this product and I'm immediately calmer.  Is it the placebo effect?  Who knows.  For the moment though, this product works for me.  Yes, it's a bit pricey which is why I only use it when I have a desperate need.  My only complaint is that it contains sucralose, which I'm not a fan of.  But the benefits I get from the product overrules the sucralose issue.  Not being a fan of carbonated drinks, I like that it's "lightly carbonated."  The taste is a light citrus flavor - very similar to Fresca.  If you're curious about this product, I would recommend purchasing 1 bottle as a test before buying a case of it.

review/summary: Yummy drink, helps me prevent migraines & low in sugar.
review/text: This drink is pleasant, perhaps due to the fizzy slightly sweet taste. It doesn't have that high sugar content other drinks have. What's more, it's helped me whenever I feel a migraine headache coming in. Now I order it by the case because it isn't cheap at the stores, nor is easy to find. I have read some of the reviews here where people claim it doesn't work for them. I understand everyone is different. I'm just lucky that it works for me and it does the job.

review/summary: Tasty but effectiveness is questionable
review/text: I bought this in a Long Island gas station was amazed by the taste for only 35 calories! I then had to buy some online to see maybe one bottle day would effect my mood. I had one everyday for about two weeks and although tasty and low calorie, I did not see any effect on my mood. If it were cheaper, I would buy it just to drink daily whether or not it made me 'blissful' but at about 2.50 a bottle, it's just not worth it.

review/summary: Good Stuff..worth it!
review/text: I indulge in a lot of caffeine and came across this one day in the store.  Skeptical, the bottle was cool so I tried it really not looking for much.  It taste suprisingly good and its smooth.  It gives you a relaxed feeling as if nothing can get you down and it gives a low-mild euphoria feeling without feeling tired.  I know what euphoris feels like from taking other things in life...but this being healthy is a good alternative and after trying one bottle I tried two 2day and Im relaxed and actually felt like posting on here because I feel really good and positive about things right now after consuming 2 bottles.  Not a waste of money..probably will be very popular soon....this works..5hr power works and I am very picky abt what I take to relax and get or get goin...hope my review helps....

review/summary: Works For Me
review/text: I found NeuroBliss in a gas station.  I was already in an okay mood, but, I thought this might give me a boost.  The flavor is a bit like mineral water and grapefruit.  Fresca light I call it.  It is better very cold.  I drank the entire bottle and about ten minutes later I really did feel better.  I am already on an antidepressant so I am always trying anything I can to stay in a good mood.  I don't think it is mind over matter.  I really was in a better mood. I was laughing and singing and cutting up with my husband. We had a very good day all day.  I am so glad to find these here since it is a very long drive from where I live to purchase them. I will definitely buy the Neurobliss and will be trying some of the other drinks, too.

review/summary: You go from -_- to :D. Euphoria in a bottle. HOWEVER...
review/text: I tried Neruo Bliss on a whim and I am really, really impressed. It's a great, probably healthy alternative to soda and it really does work like it says.<br /><br />The situation: I'm almost 17, 6'4", football player build but skeletal, as I get absolutely no exercise. Relatively healthy diet. I bought Bliss with my lunch at an upscale-ish convenience store (Wawa, if you happen to recognize the name). It was a relatively "gloomy" day, overcast and it felt like it was going to rain. I took my lunch to an Atlanta Bread Company store to eat.<br /><br />Bliss had a refreshing citrus-y taste. It quenched my thirst, and I had some rather dry food with me. I felt it kick in almost immediately. Bliss provides a warm, fuzzy euphoric feeling, kind of like when your favorite song comes on the radio. There was definitely a spring in my step for the next hour or so. I felt cheerful, happy with the world, ect. Interestingly, I found a used Nintendo DS for exactly the same price that I had earned babysitting the previous weekend while "high", so maybe Bliss is lucky or something.<br /><br />The "high" is a focused lightheartedness. You want to jump up and punch the air if something good happens, listen to loud sing-along music, ect. I had a spirited and amusing conversation with a Gamestop employee about my lack of rewards cards. It's caffeine-free, too, which is awesome given that I'm unfortunately a caffeine addict. The euphoric sensation kind of wears off after the first hour, but you still feel energetic and rather cheerful. I even went to the orthodontist and walked out with a small grin. It was potent enough that I could tell it was not a placebo.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there are a few cons to this drink. First of all, it's quite obviously been sweetened with artificial sweeteners. This might not bother everyone, but I'm an actor/singer and I try to avoid those because they aren't good for your throat/voice. Second, it is rather pricey. Third, I may or may not have crashed afterwards. I'm not entirely sure. If I did crash, it was a minor crash, not like after an energy drink. Plus, the "high" lasted much longer than most energy drinks.<br /><br />This is a great drink and I'm definitely a Neuro fan. I'm going to try Sonic this afternoon for an acting class; in the meantime I have also reviewed Passion.

review/summary: Tasty and effective
review/text: It tasted good, mostly because there is only a little bit of sugar (9g in whole bottle).  Those supplements do have a very nice subtle effect, although maybe a misnomer to call it 'Bliss'.  Maybe mini-bliss, or warm clarity, or something.<br /><br />I've started to drink it after a workout and it's a nice way to replenish sugars and get some liquid.  Also, can't complain about that warm fuzzy feeling, even if it isn't 'Bliss'.  Kind of like having a cup of tea in the evening and relaxing.  Some of the supplements are found in tea, too.<br /><br />It's too pricey to be an everyday drink.  If it were around $1-$1.50 a bottle I would make it a habit to drink one every day.  I'm tempted to drop it a star again for that, but this is really better than three stars.  Maybe if they pay less money for *fancy* advertising and *fancy* bottles the price would be more reasonable.

review/text: I like the Neuro Drinks, but when I first tried Bliss, I appreciated the taste. However, after consuming Bliss on a regular basis, I felt that the taste wasn't as good as I remembered. Also, the 'happy' side effects are now minimal, but that's just me.<br /><br />A better Neuro Drink is Sonic.

review/summary: Magic in a bottle!
review/text: Ok, so not sure why the person is griping that there are fake reviews but I have to say this is true to claim. My dog passed away on May 13th,2011 (she was like my daughter) and I was severely depressed to say the least. I wasnt sleeping at all and was just miserable. The following weekend  I decided to help my friend with a project she had undertaken....bad idea since I wasnt sleeping I was extra grumpy so my usual patient and calm demenor was non-existent. So I came across this Neuro Bliss in some far out store and it caught my eye. Can I say instant mood changer! It relaxed me and it was like I drank the stress away! I highly recommend it. Just even as a pickme up. and its yummy :-)

review/summary: No, Bliss Can't Be Found in a Bottle, but Vitamin B Can.
review/text: To be honest, I committed a heinous act I originally swore I never would: I bought this product because the presentation (bottle shape, color, font) was visually appealing and I liked that it stated the drink contains only 35 calories (you'd have to drink five of these to equal the caloric content of a Dr. Pepper!).<br /><br />It has a sort of grapefruit-like taste, although subtle, which I like. More important, however, is the fact that this drink, in the end, is a nutritional supplement. Being a petite, small-framed woman, I don't take in 2000 calories a day--but if I did, one bottle of Neuro Bliss would provide me with 200% of my daily Vitamin B6 and 100% of my Vitamin B12. For those of you who aren't familiar, Vitamin B is HUGE for mood regulation; many people with depression and anxiety have critically low levels of B in their systems. Again, compared to soda, this drink can and will give you a natural, healthy boost for the day.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this product to anyone dissatisfied with watery or faux-chocolate-tasting nutritional supplements, or otherwise looking to replace soda in their daily diets. It's a little more expensive, but your body will thank you.

review/summary: Didn't know exactly what to expect, turned out better.
review/text: The first reason why I had even purchased this drink was because of a friend, of a friend, I saw their post on a blog telling people how this drink was "so good and refreshing," that I, myself, wanted to give it a try. They say that you'll never know if something is good or not, till you try for yourself.<br /><br />Amazon took awhile to ship and it was delivered on a day I didn't expect it to, so that worked out nicely. Packing of the drinks was questionable, but I've bought things from Amazon before so that was no real big deal to me. So that was 1 Star.<br /><br />When I first took a sip, I noticed a difference it had from many other "energy" drinks I've had before. Lightly carbonated, is a big understatement to me. It felt more like a juice that would always be cold, because the way it has been carbonated made it feel that way. So I don't really consider it to be an energy drink at all. 2 Stars there, tasted better than expected and for 12 bottles, it is a bit pricey but to me, not a big deal considering if this is what I'm paying for, then I'll stop with those other cruddy drinks for these.<br /><br />The last star, over the period of maybe 2 weeks I had finished all 12 bottles and gave some to my younger siblings to try. None of them told me of anything described on the label to have happened to them, but they loved the taste of it. In my opinion, Bliss has the best taste so far and I have tried Sonic as well, and I wouldn't recommend that one. Maybe after the first few days or so, I did notice feeling calmer, energy-wise I did feel like I had more energy to do things that I wanted to around the house and at school. But not by a lot.<br /><br />Reason for not giving that last star. The drink is good, better than I had expected to be, and the price of $2.50 per drink isn't so bad at all. This is considering that most energy drinks now cost in the range of $1.25 to $2.25. So for a little extra, you get something better and isn't hidden in a can where you can't see what is actually in there, plus tastes great.<br /><br />Recently I've just purchased Neuro Sun and Neuro Sleep, so I'll probably end up writing reviews for both of those as well.<br /><br />All in all, Neuro Bliss, in my opinion, definitely is worth the money. But don't go into buying this drink expecting too much out of it, that way when you do try it, it'll end up being better than you what you could have expected it to be. Maybe it'll even surprise you.

review/summary: Subtle yet effective
review/text: Though I, like many, aren't happy with the price, it does work. I've been drinking the bliss and sonic versions of nuero for the past week and it has done quite a bit to boost my creativity, help my overall mood, and cut through the clutter to find manageable tasks that can be conquered. It very well may be the placebo effect but then again the effects are going to be subtle unlike energy drinks which kick you in the face and leave you jittery and wired. Its vitamins, nutrients, amino acids and such, it's not going to wash over you like warm wave of happiness, but it will subtly and pleasantly leave you feeling good (and with the sonic; productive).  And no I have no affiliation with nuero and heard about this from a friend who bought it locally.

If I use my prescribed pain killers I turn into a dumb lump.  But, taken with Neuro Bliss, my medication gives me 4 hours of significant pain relief AND significant mental focus!  (I'm 62 and have never before experienced mental focus!}.<br />I am not saying it is a miracle cure.  The effects are soft and subtle.............  exactly what I need.  If it is a placebo, don't tell me.<br />I have my magic potion shipped to my door and look forward to those four hours each day when I can be myself.<br />Thank you.<br />merle

review/text: I'm sure this is person by person, but for me, this product does work.  On a very stressful day at work, I feel much less overwhelmed if I drink one.<br /><br />As one other reviewer said, though, it's not like taking a drug- the effect is subtle, but for me it is noticeable.<br /><br />I'd say the effect is about the same as taking 2-3 B Vitamins, which I also find helpful during stressful times.<br /><br />Tastes good.  A little pricey, but I wait for them to go on sale at Safeway and stock up.
