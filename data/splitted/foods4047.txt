review/summary: Great Product
review/text: The vet made me get the expensive food his office pushes on everyone and I'm sure gets paid to sell to his patients. I fed this to my cat and he went from a healthy 12 pounds up to 20 pounds.  I went right out and got the Purina food and began feed it to my cat. That was 4 months ago and now he is back down to 15 pounds and I am NOT getting any more expensive vet food.

review/summary: Advice
review/text: Please make sure you buy this food in small quantities at first if you are unsure that your cat will like it. Our Russian Blue treats it like medicine because he hates the taste of it. He only eats it because we have been strict with his diet and refuse to give him much else besides the urinary formulated foods. We intend to stop buying this product completely.<br /><br />Our most effective food for him has been the Royal Canin Urinary Formula (you can only get it from the vet), as he loves it and it keeps his pH in check - however, it's $50 for a 7 lb bag. Not too pretty.<br /><br />We also tried the more expensive "Pro Plan" equivalent - and it is the same product in a different bag, which made it even worse. Both products do work (this one and the Pro Plan) but good luck trying to feed it!<br /><br />We now feed wet Friskies "Special Diet : Urinary pH" and our cats love it! It comes in beef, chicken, or (the best one) ocean whitefish. It's very affordable as well. Check it out.<br /><br />If you still decide to try this out, please please please buy a small bag first so you know your cat will not hate it!

review/summary: Cat loves it
review/text: Our cat loves this formula.  I'm happy that the primary ingredients are actual meat, rather than grains.  Cats are carnivores, after all.  Our cat has had many less problems with hairballs and weight gain as well.

review/summary: Saved my carpets and possibly my cat
review/text: For years my cat has had digestive issues no matter what food I've given her.  I've spoken to the vet about this a few times and more than one vet simply told me "Some cats throw up more than others".<br /><br />I tried a few other sensitive stomach-type cat foods, including Eukanuba, which is considered one of the best on the market.  Not only did the Eukanuba not work, but because the fiber content in it was so high, I had to change my litter boxes twice as often as I had to previously.<br /><br />This cat food has been a life saver for both of the cats I have with digestive issues.  It has reduced the number of times my cat throws up significantly, from a few times a week, to once or less (outside of normal hairballs).  The other cat with some litterbox issues have cleared up almost entirely.<br /><br />Well worth the money (which is far less on Amazon than any local pet store I've found).<br /><br />If you have a cat with a sensitive stomach, this is the answer.

review/summary: Kitties love it and a lot less expensive than the vet's
review/text: One of the kitties has a very sensitive tummy, and I had been spending quite a bit of money, not to mention the inconvenience of running to the vet's every couple of weeks to buy their "special" brand.  One day I noticed that Purina made the vet's brand, and started to wonder if they made a version sold in the grocer.  Sure enough, Sensitive Systems from the Purina One line was in the store.  I slowly transitioned the kitties to it without any ill effects.  Purchasing this on the regularly scheduled delivery not only lowered my costs, it is so convenient to come home and find it waiting on my doorstep!  I am really pleased with the Purina One brand.  The cats are healthy, and can't wait for me to get up in the morning to bring it to them.

review/summary: Beware! Not the product shown in picture!
review/text: Amazon, please update your picture for accurate product info.<br /><br />If you are looking for this product made with yogurt, this is NOT it despite what the picture shows. Purina has changed the recipe, and its hard to find the old formula that was made with yogurt. My cat has a sensitive stomach and has thrown up all foods we have tried besides the type made with yogurt. Now that the recipe has changed, he is throwing up daily again. I was so excited to see I could buy the yogurt version on AMAZON in bulk... till it arrived. This is not the product I wanted, the picture is very misleading considering their disclaimer says that all ingredients may not be listed on the site. Its on the picture so I thought I would get what I saw.

My cats are coming up on their 4th birthday (2 of them), and have not once ever had a hairball. I mix this food 2:1 with the sensitive systems food because one of my cats has digestive issues.

I would not say it gets rid of hair balls but I think it has really cut down on the number of hairballs we have to live through.  Weight wise, I dont see his indoor life causeing weight gain so it must be helping there as well.  I wish the price was not so high, but on subscribe and save, I save money, and never run out.....

review/summary: Costamar Cream of Coconut is the Cream of the Crop!
review/text: One of my top selling bakery products is Coconut Cream pie, and the main ingredient is cream of coconut. The cream is very scarce in my hometown, so I visited Amazon.com for the product. Costamar Cream of Coconut was the least expensive of the two selections offered. The other product I had already tried and was quite satisfied, but I decided to try Costamar, and am I happy that I did. The consistency is more gel-like, and the taste is deeply coconut. It mixes smoothly with the other ingredients, and the filling gels more quickly. The taste, ahhh the taste, is the creamiest, melt-in-your-mouth coconut cream pie you've ever tasted! My coconut cream pie is rated the best in town, and I pass the same rating on to Costamar Cream of Coconut! Another plus is that it comes in a pack of 24 15-ounce cans! Great price, great product, great review!

review/summary: Too Sweet and like syrup-DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
review/text: I would not buy this again.  I have purchased the Coco Lopez brand in the past, which has a much fresher coconut taste.  Like another reviewer said, this brand is pure sugar and preservatives.  I am currently in a wheelchair recovering from a fractured pelvis and cannot go shopping (most of my friends are just too busy) so I purchased this brand online.  In retrospect I should have paid a bit more for the Coco Lopez brand as it actually tastes like real coconut and has real coconut fat in it as I kept it in the fridge and the fat separated (remember, in moderation coconut fat is good for you, with many health benefits).  This brand just stays like a syrup in the fridge, no separation.  I will not be purchasing this again and as soon as I can I will be giving the rest away.

Quinoa is similar to wild rice, but has a complete protein (so you don't have to eat beans with it to get the same nutrition!).

There are tons of good recipes on the web. Quinoa is the perfect grain for gluten intolerant persons. Enjoy!

It comes in a small can, which is perfect for one or two kittens, and he absolutely loves the taste.  Win-win situation for us! We bought two cases which will last for several months.

review/summary: Lots of vitamins, but not filling
review/text: I fed this to my kittens by recommendation of my vet. They gave me several coupons that made it quite inexpensive.<br /><br />It's packed with a lot of vitamins. My childhood pets were always fed it, and they lived to 14 years or so, and so I thought it would be good for my kittens.<br /><br />Their fur was glossy and they appeared healthy, but they were always hungry after eating their assigned portion. I switched to an organic human-grade kibble and the kittens were contented after their portions. This told me that the food must have been filling the cats up, but not substantially enough to keep them full. Just as a human could fill up on rice and chicken nuggets and vitamins (the human equivalents of some of the ingredients) and be healthy, but not really feel contented in their bellies.<br /><br />This is less expensive than the organic food I buy them now, but they want to eat more so I don't know what the end cost really is. I like the idea of all of the vitamins in there, just as I would take a multi-vitamin, but I just wish that their bellies could keep full after eating. I probably won't go back to this kibble. I wish I could rate it higher for the vitamins, but these corn meal and by-product ingredient listings really explain my kittens lack of feeling full.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Lots of vitamins<br />* Left fur glossy<br /><br />CONS:<br />* Always begging for more food<br />* Corn meal and chicken by-products near the top of ingredient list (poor quality, not human grade)

review/summary: My cats really like it
review/text: Fortunately, my kittens have had no ill behaviors while eating this food like the previous reviewers cat. I mixed this in with my Purina Kitten Chow that my kittens were eating and the kittens seemed to really love it. My other two, one year old cats were also fond of "stealing" the kittens dry food instead of their usual Iams (where real chicken is the main ingredient), so this must be tasty. Usually, I just feed my cats dry food on a free choice basis and supplement with canned cat food and boiled chicken meat. My only gripe is this isn't a dry food that someone on a strict budget could likely readily afford on a regular basis for a number of cats. Otherwise, this is a good quality kitten food.

review/summary: Not a very good food.
review/text: My view of this product has changed since we have been feeding Halo; the cats seem healthier and happier.  The kitten's coat was getting very rough and now is smooth and silky.  I'm told that you should feed the best you can afford, and this food is expensive, but not very high-quality, as far as we could tell.  Plus, our kitten gained too much weight on it.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Addictive, empty filler, but my cat went anorexic without it
review/text: My older cat, 4 years, got "hooked" on Hill's Science Diet Kitten formula when I brought a new kitten, along with a big bag of free S/D, home from the pound. [Prior to that, my well-adjusted cat would eat raw chicken, high quality canned foods, organic kibble--all the "good stuff"]<br /><br />Both cats thrived on S/D.  So much so that the kitten grew and grew and grew, into a hefty 9 pounds at 7 months. The 4 year-old cat began ignoring her own food and started eating the kitten's food.  She filled out, also, but to a nice adult weight of 6 pounds.<br /><br />Okay, so 2 months later the kitten is up to 10 pounds and can barely walk without panting.  She cannot stop eating this S/D stuff.  She's enormous, way bigger than her 4 year-old housemate.  I decide to switch back to the healthier food--like Innova Evo, which is 88% meat protein and grain free.  I also augment with superior wet food (the 100% organic, human grade stuff, along with raw chicken, etc).<br /><br />Kitten is okay with that switch--like a tiger she tears away at the raw chicken, gulps at the premium can food--but the older cat doesn't like it, although I do it very gradually over 3 months.  I sit with her, pet her, calm her...Yes, she does eat, just not much--a few kibble crunches, or a tablespoon of wet food.  [Cornell has over 300 studies on anorexic cats].<br /><br />A couple months go by and the kitten is looking better, not panting as much (and  2 pounds lighter) but our 4 year-old cat is now down to 2.9 pounds!  All her ribs show and she has bones where her shoulders are.  She looks like a cheetah that's been deprived of food.  No mater what food I put in front of her--dry, wet, kibble, shredded meat--she will only nibble bits and pieces, here and there.  Her fur has lost its glossy coat.<br /><br />The vet tells me I have to do something, anything, to stop the decline in my cat's health, even if it means feeding the crummy Science Diet Kitten food, Original Formula.<br /><br />I am two days into feeding the cat the S/D Kitten food.  She is wolfing this stuff down as if there's no tomorrow.  It makes me sad that she's become another S/D addict--it's that darn corn filler, converts to sugar and cats love it.  I know, I'd rather have her alive and eating this crud, then wasting to nothing away on more nourishing food.  At least I can console myself that the kitten KNOWS she's a feline and eats like one.

review/summary: My cats won't eat it
review/text: I was sent a bag of this with a litter of kittens I am fostering. At first I thought perhaps the kittens were just more interested in wet food, because they wouldn't eat this stuff. Then they discovered my own personal cats' food (a much, much less expensive brand), and they were grubbing on it! My own cats turned up their noses at the Science Diet, too.<br /><br />It may be fabulously nutritious, but that doesn't really matter if my cats refuse to touch it.<br /><br />My dog liked it, though.

review/text: I highly recommend this product, I hope they get it back in stock soon.  It has an intensely smokey flavor.  I had read the reviews, and was cautiously optimistic when I tried it.  I had previously purchased a very expensive brand, received three small tins of hot, sweet, and mild smoked paprika and used it like gold.  It was excellent, but too expensive, and as a result I was not using and experimenting with it as I usually would.  This is wonderfully priced, you receive 24 ounces, plenty to share, or use with ease.  Great flavor, great color, convenient packaging.  Highly recommend!!

review/summary: NOT the regular of old we were used to
review/text: We enjoyed Farmer Bros coffee for many years at work. Then the business closed down and we only could drink it at reataurants or donut shops. I finally found an outlet I could buy as cash, and got a 5# whole bean. But now the bag looked different and had "gourmet" on it... OK, it does taste great, so they ranked it, I thought. Opened it at home, and yes, good aroma. Brewed our first pot... hardly any scent in the kitchen... bland taste. What?<br />Made a stronger pot...boring flavor! NOT THE FLAVOR we knew it to be!  So, I had to mix it with Sumatra or Costa Rica beans to use up 5# bag!!!<br />I go there yesterday and ask for their freshest bag. I get it. Drive it to work, but NO SCENT ON THE CAR!! My car would smell like coffee for days, with the previous purchase. I thought it was my cold (why I could not smell it well). Opened it at home...yes good coffee smell. Brewed a pot...and STILL NOT LIKE THE OLD BREW! Had a nutty flavor. Wife was bloody upset! Had to go to McDonald's for her coffee. Ran to buy more Sumatra and Costa Rican coffee at T.J.s to save the day.<br />STRIKE 2 for Farmer Bros. Went to the Donut shop. I see Supreme Plus on their brewer. I ask her. She says, "no, get their cheapest brand, they have several types".<br />So, I am returning this BAD "Gourmet" IMITATION to the shop, and if they do not carry the old traditional packaged (beige with brown lettering), their CEO must have left or died, and so did their traditional blend. But the Donut shop gets it!  I do not see the old blend even here at Amazon. So, hope you can get used to this NEW blend... cause it AINT THE TRADITIONAL FLAVOR :(

I'm a fan and would recommend it to any mint fan.<br /><br />In addition to this tea, I've consumed several other mint teas, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG5IZK">Bigelow Peppermint Herbal Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO630W">SerendipiTea Organic Mint, Au Naturale Tisane & Peppermint Tea, 2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> and Taylors of Harrogate Herbal Peppermint Tea Box 20 Tea Bags.  The two best teas in terms of overall freshness are the Harney & Sons tea and the Bigelow tea.  The packets just keep the tea perfect until the moment of brewing.  If you cannot find Harney & Sons or Bigelow, the peppermint options offered by Taylors of Harrogate is good.<br /><br />While it is convenient to use individually bagged teas while traveling or at the office, they definitely lead to more waste. If you like mint tea and are willing to use a home brewer like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D07MCU">Finum Goldton Filters, Blue and Green</a>, a good loose mint tea is the aforementioned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO630W">SerendipiTea Organic Mint, Au Naturale Tisane & Peppermint Tea, 2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>.  The SerendipiTea is not quite as fresh tasting as the individually packaged teas that are offered by Harney & Sons and Bigelow.<br /><br />If freshness and flavor are of optimal importance, Harney & Sons produces a fine tea.  Just know there are some other options.  Bigelow also has a very fresh tea that is individually packaged.  SerendipiTea provides a loose tea that is good and, if all of these options are gone, Taylors of Harrogate is a decent backup.<br /><br />4.5 stars

review/summary: Peppermint Tea
review/text: I got hooked on Harney & Sons tea a while ago.  Most of the varieties I've tried are excellent, and this is no exception.  The tea bags are in foil packets, which keeps them fresh.  It's also wonderful served hot or iced.  I would definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Spend a little more and get the sachets, not the bags
review/text: Bought these after going through a tin of the sachets.  These are bags, and they are NOT the same.  The sachets were so fresh and had such an essence of peppermint without any bitterness (even when a little over-steeped).  Even the smell of a cup of tea from the sachet felt pepperminty in scent and sensation.  However, the bags just don't do the tea justice.  Not only does tea from the bags, as opposed to the sachets not stand out as a peppermint tea, but also they actually have a sort of bleached water aftertaste.  I say this probably and only in comparison to the Harney & Sons sachets.  Get the sachets.  If you are a lover of peppermint tea, you'll dream about this tea from the sachet.

review/summary: Different, delicious herbal tea
review/text: I first found this tea at a favorite store (Smokehouse of the Catskills, Veteran, NY) that sells a lot of interesting foods imported from Germany as well as their own smoked and fresh meats.  I'd enjoyed this brand's mint tea for years, so despite some irritation at their giving up the lovely brand name "Pompadour" for the far less pleasant (to me) "Teekanne", I decided to try their other flavors.  The fennel is lovely; I like it at least as much as mint, and it has a positive effect on an unsettled stomach.  People who dislike licorice or anise flavors would be unlikely to enjoy it, but I really appreciate both the aroma and the taste, and am happy to find it on Amazon.

review/summary: Truly Wonderful.
review/text: I saw the company was offering a "buy-one-get-one-free" coupon offer on their website and although I did not partake on it, the offerings interested me greatly. Two Whole Foods and a gourmet deli search later, I found a local place that finally had it in stock. They did not have the flavor I wanted but I chose this instead.<br /><br />I don't like the taste of flavored waters most of the time but I was in need of a beverage after a long work day and I was glad to have found it. Upon opening a bottle, I suggest smelling it! The aroma is a precursor of the natural thrill to come. I am not a fan of anything minty, but when I began to drink it I was taken aback by how smooth and refreshing it really is. The tastes are of a medium distinction so if anyone is concerned about the strength I suggest you shouldn't worry.<br /><br />The best part was the clearing of my nostrils afterwards! I couldn't believe that part. I look forward to trying the others (if I can find more places near me). I give this a "yea"!

I don't usually drink bottled water for environmental reasons, but this is one product I treat myself to every now and then. It's especially wonderful after a long, hot sweat session at the gym.<br /><br />My only issue (and this is not directly related to the product) is that I wish Amazon.com offered these cases of water in a Subscribe & Save option. I order 1-2 cases per month and would love the option of an automated regular monthly delivery.

Drinking it cold was so amazingly refreshing; it also helped relieve mid-day hunger because of its flavoring.  I think it would be a great weight-loss supplement.<br /><br />I haven't tried any of the other flavors -- I thought chocolate was a little too crazy -- but now I'm definitely going to.  Thanks @ Dallas, too, for the info on the chocolate water.  Can't wait to give it a shot.

I love reading the ingredient list - usually only two ingredients (max of 3).<br /><br />The way I enjoy Metromint: I get a wine glass, fill it with Ice, and then poor in the Metromint. Really excellent that way! I like all the flavors though the Orange Mint, Peppermint, and Chocolate Mint are my favorites. The aroma of the Chocolate Mint reminds me of a York Peppermint Patty when I drink it. Again, really excellent over ice. Using subscribe and save is less than it costs at my grocery store and conveniently arrives on my doorstep without shipping costs. Much better than buying from the manufacturer and saves me lugging product home from the store. I highly recommended product and it is a good value when using Subscribe and Save.

review/summary: Great tasting
review/text: I wasn't a fan of drinking this as it is, so I added some stevia, and it was perfect.  A nice way to get my chocolate fix without consuming any calories.

review/summary: The Classic Mint Water
review/text: I love metromint products. I've never really liked drinking water, but metromint is so much more refreshing than regular water and doesn't add any calories or chemicals to my diet. The peppermint is by far the "mintiest" flavor they make. It tastes kind of like drinking water while chewing a strong peppermint gum. I keep it at my desk at work because it doesn't need to be refrigerated and still feels cool because of the mint. This is a wonderful product for mint lovers, but if you don't like a strong mint flavor, the fruity metromints are not quite as strong.

review/summary: Metromint Chocolatemint water is delicious, refreshing, and it's calorie free
review/text: This Metromint Water, in the Chocolatemint flavor is terrific. It is so refreshing, especially now that warm weather has arrived. The chocolate flavor is very true as well as the mint flavor.<br /><br />The water is not sweetened. With its delicious taste, it doesn't need to be sweet. I like to chill it well in the fridge rather than serving it with ice. I don't want to dilute the taste with melting ice.<br /><br />One of the other reviewers described the taste perfectly when he said this water tastes as if you had just eaten an Andes Mint and then had a sip of cold water. Very, very refreshing.

review/text: I've been trying to eat and drink more healthfully since I'm pregnant and I can't find a lot to drink without having a lot of sugar or artificial additives or caffeine or SOMETHING I shouldn't be consuming... I was getting really tired of plain water, then Metromint water came to the rescue.  All natural, not boring, no sugar.  Love it.

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: I currently reside in rural NE MO. The water ...well, tapwater, anyway, leaves much to be desired. I'd actually rather NOT drink it.(or bathe in it...) THAT said, while I try to steer clear of bottled waters, esp *trendy, designer waters* as a rule, or too much in the way of pre-packaged anything, I have to say I really enjoy Metromint and will continue to purchase as long as it's available, esp. with Amazon's free shipping offer. Ordered two cases here recently; same price as in store, with the bonus of saving gas $ for the two hour round trip drive had I purchased it up North. (haven't seen it locally.) Very refreshing, wonderfully clean, calorie-free natural chocolate-minty "essence" in a bottle. I was skeptical until I opened my first one; *new* loyal customer! Perfect for quashing that sweet craving or quenching your *more discerning* thirst.

review/text: I have tired all of these flavored waters but my favorite by far is the chocolatemint.  It is so tasty and refreshing!  I love that I can get it from amazon now by the case.  Was paying $2 each at the local health store.  0 Calories, 0 Carbs, 0 Sugar.  Just water with a great refreshing flavor.  The chocolatemint especially helps me curb my chocolate cravings and snacking in the late afternoons.  Love this stuff!

review/summary: Tastes like a squirt of toothpaste mixed into a bottle of water
review/text: Not for me.<br /><br />First, the positives: 0 calories, trendy/cool presentation, no preservatives nor artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />The downside -- the taste is just awful.  In terms of a flavor, spearmint isn't my first choice in gum, yet I find it tolerable.  The spearmint flavor here was faint and vague to the point that it annoyed my taste buds because it was just mild enough to feel like I'm awkwardly drinking a squirt of toothpaste stirred into 16 ounces of water.

review/text: Ok so I don't really like this product- which may be a me problem, and not a problem of the product itself.<br /><br />I love Metromint in Orange Mint, Spearment, Chocolatemint.  Peppermint isn't bad, but a little intense.  I do not like this flavor, it's too weird, minty with a slight cough syrup tang to it.  If you like cherry flavored cough syrups and mint, then maybe it works for you.<br /><br />If not, don't give up on Metromint, just go get one of the other ones.<br /><br />I wasn't a huge fan of the Lemon one either, and there is another berry one that others have reported tastes like minty fruit gum.  I'd skip those.<br /><br />This is a great product for diabetics.  My sister came down with gestational diabetes, and I bought her the chocolate mint.  She loved it, and it had no affect on blood sugar.
