review/text: This stuff was really good! I was expecting it to be weak and bitter like most powdered flavor drinks. This tasted close to weak Kool aid. No aftertaste. Even the kids liked it. Please note though that is only costs around 3 dollars at the grocery store, it is way overpriced here.

So I saved, from each bag, the flavors that werent my favorites and gobbled up the red and pink ones first---put away the other flavors. But as my favs slowly (nah--quickly disappeared) I made my way downthe flavor choices! I was really happy that there werent a lot of kids ringing my bell on Halloween!

review/summary: Grain-Free Quality Ingredients
review/text: I have 3 terriers and one is an allergy dog. She's got both seasonal allergies and is sensitive to food ingredients. After years of treating the symptoms with drugs I started reading about how a "species appropriate" diet would help with her allergies. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/098253311X">Dr. Becker's Real Food for Healthy Dogs and Cats: Simple Homemade Food</a> I never knew by reading the label on dog food what was good or bad, now after learning about how dog food is made, what ingredients are most important and what I should avoid, I've started feeding "grain free" and as low a carbohydrate feed as I can find commercially. We must be careful that dog food isn't overrun by ingredients that have too many carbs like potatoes (sweet or otherwise) peas and grains. Dogs wouldn't get those in their natural diet unless in the stomach of prey. Be careful, when a food ingredient is listed on the label multiple times, the food is mostly that ingredient. So it could be all potato and not meat. Anyway... In an ideal world I would be cooking for my dogs, but I just don't have the time or the freezer space for that. After much research, trial and error, I've found Nature's Variety's line of products, from a small company, dedicated to quality, American ingredients (as best I can tell). Their products are made with high quality ingredients and with an ancestral diet in mind. Even though I leave kibble out all day, my pups dance around the bowl at dinner time to get Nature's Variety grain-free canned food.  What's nice is that since they don't use grain or too many carbs, my dogs get good nutrition and their stool (yeah it gross but that's a factor in buying dog food) is firm and small and less odoriferous. My allergy girl is doing well and I only have to treat seasonally when its really bad outside.  If you'd like some help to determine if the food you buy is really good for your dog, I've found www(dot)DogFoodAdvisor(dot)com to be the best place for reviews of both wet and dry dog food. I may not agree with everything they say, but its a wonderful place to start. I know that your 4-legged friend will do well with Nature's Variety.

review/summary: Dogs won't eat it. Has Unpleasant Texture And Smell
review/text: My two small dogs were always happy with the Instinct chicken and beef varieties. And they have always loved lamb. So I ordered a case of this and I deeply regret it.<br /><br />First off it has a very unpleasant heavy and dense texture. It's hard to break it up into small pieces. All canned dog food has a certain dog food smell but in this case it's very pronounced.<br /><br />Finally my dogs only eat it with great reluctance. Instead of finishing their bowls by the end of the evening, as is their norm, they seem to only eat enough to avoid extreme hunger.<br /><br />I had a bad experience with a bag of dry Instinct cat food that gave ALL of three cats some major digestive troubles. Combined with this I think I've lost faith in the Instinct brand. They put the little American flag on the can and state that it is Made In America but they don't say where the ingredients come from. In this case the lamb must be the cheapest and poorest quality lamb on the face of the planet.<br /><br />If you still want to give this a try don't be a dope like me and order a whole case. Buy one or two cans somewhere and try it out first.

review/text: I purchased this granola at my local grocer and loved it.  It is a perfect snack for me to eat when I need a little something to tide me over until the next meal.<br />When I went back to purchase more, they had switched brands and did not carry it any more.  I tried to find another grocer in Hawaii but could not find one so I decided to check on Amazon and to my surprise, there it was in a six-pack!  I was elated and now have a great source for my favorite snack!  Thank you, Amazon.

review/summary: Love at first bite!
review/text: This granola is probably one of the best I've ever had! It definitely fulfills my chocolate cravings; the nuts add an extra crunch and texture, and the cherries a light touch of tart/sweetness. This granola is as good an inbetween meal snack as it is a breakfast cereal. The incredients are pure and unadulterated(oats, brown sugar, almonds, coconut, dried cherries, pecans, cocoa, maltodextrin (fiber), salt and cinnamon), with only natural flavors added. A 1/3 cup serving is 110 calories, with 40 calories from fat, 40 mg sodium, 16 grams of carbs and zero cholesterol (that is, if you can limit yourself to one measured serving)!

review/summary: Got CLOSE SECOND PLACE for My Tastes
review/text: I wanted to have "sized" portions of chip-type product that would be tasty and filling.  I tried at least 6 different brands of popcorn-type snack packages (unfortunately, most came in 24-36 item packages).  After receiving the first 5 brands, I felt they were total waste of money.... 2 had texture of light styrofoam peanuts, with almost no flavor.  A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.  PopCorners White Cheddar brand came in SECOND.  Nice crunchy texture and pleasant cheddar flavor (I haven't tried the other flavors of this)

review/summary: These are incredible!
review/text: Found these at a "close-out" type store a few months ago, and as we often do, like to take a chance on weird snacks. Since I have trouble eating regular popcorn due to the hulls getting stuck in my teeth, I thought this might be a good way to get my popcorn fix.<br /><br />We returned the next day and bought an entire box of the White Cheddar bags. It was THAT good. With a family of four, snacks tend to be bought with the knowledge that only one or two people enjoy a certain flavor. However, when it comes to Popcorners, if there is a bag of kettle or white cheddar flavor around, it WILL be eaten by everyone.<br /><br />You won't regret buying a bag (or 12) and hopefully they will be in stores all across the country soon. A local independent grocery store recently started selling them as well (for 2.29) a bag. The "close-out" store had sold out the initial order in about 2 weeks, and luckily they just got more in FINALLY!<br /><br />Let's see this company do well, as it's a great product, and deserves to be much more than a niche snack!<br /><br />Bravo Popcorners .. and have you thought about perhaps making a Caramel flavor??? Hmmmm?

If you add some meat, veggies, egg, and etc, one package makes a good meal with enough for two average people or one football player: quite a lot! Absolutely delicious and flavorful, no need to try any other dry brands, IMHO. It's a staple in my cupboard for quick cold-weather comfort food. Break out your large bowls, and have a feast.

review/text: Do not be deceived with the dehydrated noodles as once it is cooked and soaked in the water, the growth was huge and it was a satisfying meal.  There were two sachets with flavoring and oil mix.  I didn't use all of it in the soup base and amount you use will spend on your taste bud.  A notch up form the basic noodles packets and worth it.  The noodles did jot disintegrate if you cook it a little longer than the time prescribed, which the basic noodles tend to loose texture.  Yummy snack/meal.

review/summary: Full smooth mint (not peppermint) tea taste
review/text: I decided to go with a CBTL machine recently instead of Keurig. I liked that CBTL machines do espresso and the one I got, the Americano can accomdate tall travel mugs, has a good sized reservoir and I was happy with the reviews of the coffees and espresso capsules. But I also like a good cup of tea and was excited to try the Moroccan.<br /><br />Very pleasantly surprised. It brewed an amazingly good cup of tea in literally seconds. One thing I hesitated on was the description of peppermint. My wife and I are not peppermint people. But this was just a nice fresh common garden mint taste. Not pepperminty at all. The perfect strength for me at 10 ounce choice and the Americano makes it at just the correct temperature; slightly too hot to do more than sip at first but quickly hits the ideal temperature. If you like a medium depth, mint tea, do get this. Turns out CBTL machines make great tea as well.

review/text: This is a great crushed pineapple in its own natural juice.  So much better than all the others that are mushy and too sweet.  The even use the core of the pineapple which I absolutely love, making it have a little crunch too.  Great flavor, natural light sweetness, excellent value too!  A wonderful deal from Amazon with lightning fast free prioirty mail delivery.  Convenient and at a very reasonable price.

review/summary: The Real Deal!
review/text: This is the real deal people.  This is real Jamaican Coffee.  There are a few brands that claim to be from Blue Mountain, but they do not have that authentic taste.  My wife is Jamaican and we have been to Jamaica a few  times, but I never seem to bring back enough coffee so  I set out to find a brand here in the states that would be atleast close to what you get in Jamiaca and this is it.  Wow what flavor!

review/text: This coffee is absolutely amazing. Don't get a BLEND do not, do not buy a blend. You're not getting the real thing. I've tried this through the coffee pot (using permanent gold filter) and through french press and it's absolutely wonderful. Sweet, nutty, fruity, everything it's made out to be. worth every penny. Such a wonderful cup of coffee. I usually like mine with cream and sugar and with this cup I didn't need either. Try it black with a small amount of sugar. Excellent. Someone suggested cutting this coffee with Kona. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This coffee doesn't need to be cut by anything. It stands up on its own and if your friends didn't notice any difference in the coffee they were driking you either a) made it wrong, or b) have friends with little to no taste buds.

review/summary: a good source of Jamaican Blue Mountain
review/text: The Wallenford Estate tends to be one of the better roasts of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee.  (I find the Mad City roast to be slightly superior, but it is not available on Amazon.)  There are some barbarians in my local area who believe that extreme dark roast is popular, so they do this ultra scorch job on Jamaican Blue Mountain.  Wallenford Estate delivers promptly and withou any fuss.

review/summary: It's Okay ...
review/text: Purhcased this for Christmas Dinner and shared with family. No rave reviews from anyone. Usually everyone enjoys our coffee but no one, not a one, commented on this brew (which isn't a good thing). We ground the beans right before roasting, tried a few different racios and realized that you need an extra amount of coffee per cup to give it flavor. Flavor is what we're after as coffee people but, this fell short of the rave reviews on Amazon. We never told anyone at Christmas Dinner about the coffee so we would get a "clean" report. Got nothing back and that's not good. For ourselves, we didn't find anything but flatness in this. It might be good to cut this with Kona. We're going to try that out. This is far too expensive to throw out so we have to find a way to enjoy it. We have used other Blue Mountain coffees and love it.  We do NOT recommend this particular coffee.

review/text: My dad used to buy Jamaica blue mountain when I was a little girl. He got sick not too long ago and was in a coma for a while. When he woke up, I had to go back home, but I sent him a care package for when he got home. This was in there. Not only was he amazed I remembered this was his favorite, but he was amazed that it tasted as good as he remembered it! He had a heart attack a few months later and died, but I'm grateful I was able to remind him of one more good memory before he passed. I wasn't able to try it, but my mom still raves at how great it was, and how much my dad liked it.

review/summary: Jamaica Blue Mountain, the very best.
review/text: If you are only starting your trek into the world of serious coffee appreciation, then I highly suggest you, without haste, purchase one pound at least of whole bean JBM. Also a good grinder, a temperature controlled machine and a decent water filtration system. Pre-ground takes much of the flavor away, compaired to properly done fresh home ground coffee, and coffee is lessened without being prepaired at the correct temperature of filtered water.<br /><br />But why something so expensive? Why jump in to the deep end of the pool before even getting your feet wet?<br /><br />Some may scoff, saying that only a true coffee fanatic would understand or be able to appreciate this blend. That is entirely true. But how can anyone really understand without first having tasted the standard by which all others must be judged?<br /><br />Thus why this review is only four out of five stars. You see, JBM is so subtle, so complex, that a new tounge will not notice what makes JBM quite so wonderful.<br /><br />It is a "perfectly" blended coffee. Flavor, bitterness, acidity and aftertaste. On a scale of one to ten, they all rank dead even at five. Every other coffee is like a exaggeration of this hard to get bean.<br /><br />This should be the first coffee to ever cross the lips of anyone who wants to learn these things. How else can you truely understand the other blends?

review/text: I mean this stuff was roasted how long ago? A far lesser coffee roasted a couple of days ago is going to taste a whole lot better. At $50 per pound, what you're tasting is justification for spending the money. What you should do, if you have the money for this sort of coffee, is buy a coffee roaster and start getting good green beans (including Jamaican Blue Mountain) and roasting them fresh yourself. The folks at Sweet Maria's have all the info you need to get started.

review/summary: an interesting blend
review/text: Well, this blend is a bit more 'expressive' than a typical english breakfast tea. It has floral undertones, that I would say is an addition to the typical taste associated with black tea. It has a mildly acidic/astrigent flavor, but not to the point that the blend is sour.<br />The blend is sufficient for am 8 oz cup, and has no real drawbacks.<br />i would recommend the blend.<br />I noted another reviewer found the tea to be watery. This happened to me once when I selected the 15bar pump pressure by mistake on the CBTL machine. But, I must say that if you are use to loose tea leaves in a seeping basket, this pod-derived tea will seem a bit less than optimal.

It tastes a lot like peanut butter with chocolate mixed together. I used it first with Yonanas mixer and it worked out rather well with bananas and berries (very little berries, or otherwise the taste clashes)I've bought Peanut butter powder too so I can't figure out which one I like better, they are kind of similar, but both yummy. One little critics I have is the packaging. I had trouble opening it, so in the end I had to cut it. Now it sits open and I would rather have it tight closed. Any ideas? (except zip lock bag)? Next time I think I will buy it in a jar. And I will buy it again.

review/text: This is a pretty solid alternative to peanut butter. If the instructions on the label are followed, the peanut butter ends up a little more liquid-y than one might expect, but that is easily remedied by adjusting the amount of water. This works well for sandwiches, and is an awful lot less messy than trying to add proper peanut butter to a smoothie. I've not yet tried using it in baking, but it seems like it would be satisfactory, so long as the amount of water is reduced when making the paste.

review/text: I really love peanut butter, but one sandwich worth of peanut butter uses up most of your daily intake of saturated fats generally. This powdered stuff doesnt come close. It is as easy to use as simply stirring with a spoon and comes out just fine by my estimation. There isnt really a noticeable drop off for me personally, but i dont really eat really sugary peanut butter anyway (i would normally buy Justin's or somesuch). The chocolate is just right in this as well. Although i wanted to be able to eat PB&J's without taking up all of my fat intake, i also wanted to have something for my daily smoothies. I play around with variations, but my go to drink is kale, banana, apple, mango, and mint with flaxseed meal. This makes a great addition to that blend.<br />Anyway, i have seen mention of cheaper prices elsewhere, but for me, with Prime membership and a $5.50 price point currently, i feel the price is more than adequate, especially when factoring in no shipping and two day delivery.<br />I recommend trying this product. No transfats, high fructose corn syrup, or any added carp. Just a good, simple product.<br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Very good
review/text: This stuff is good, and once you wrap your mind around the possible ways to use it,  you will need to be buying more!  The powder is very fine, much like Nesquick. Baking with it is easy, as well most things.  The flavor is spot on, though eating it plain is not recommended. I love this mixed in with my cereal or breakfast shakes.

review/text: This product tastes great. I use it in my protien shakes to help mask the tastes of some of the flavors I have tried and do not like. With the PB2 I now like the taste of the shakes and use this every day. I prefer the PB2 with coco powder but both products taste great.

I mix in about 2 Tbsp into the dry cookie mix, add enough water to get to the right consistency and then microwave for about 5 seconds less than directed.  The end product is a warm, chewy, moist peanutbuttery chocolate chip cookie!

review/summary: YUMMY "diet" food!
review/text: I just received my order of this and the regular PB2 today.  I've lost 53 pounds on my current weight loss and exercise program, but have been wandering off down the road to fat land again, with peanut butter and chocolate chips.  I had this for dinner tonight on a multigrain bread, with a banana sliced in.  Can't even imagine the calories I saved and I have no desire to dig into the regular peanut butter jar.<br /><br />The taste isn't quite like real peanut butter, more like roasted peanuts to me, with just a hint of chocolate flavor.  Doesn't matter whether it has the exact taste or not as long as the fat is gone and the taste is good.  This passes the test with flying colors.<br /><br />The texture is not quite like the creamy fat of real peanut butter either, but I'm not bothered by it at all.<br /><br />I will buy this again and hope that my review helps others to at least give it a try.  It might just be my new BFF for the next 40 lbs.<br /><br />Glad I heard about this and decided to take it for a test drive.

One of the greatest products I have come across in years.

review/text: After reading some mixed reviews, I decided not to get my hopes up too high for the chocolate pb2, so I didn't go into trying it expecting nutella or anything.  The consistency was a lot smoother than I expected, not as grainy as regular peanut butter, which I didn't mind.  It was nice and creamy and though it may not be as sweet as regular peanut butter, it was sweet enough for me to be happy to eat it alone with a spoon! haha.  I thought it was actually really good and can see myself keeping with this stuff for a long time.

review/text: I have only tried the Chocolate PB2, and after reading all the rave reviews, I was hoping it would be a little better.  I won't say I was disappointed, because it's still fine to use instead of peanut butter, but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be.  You can't go into it thinking that the texture and taste will be too similar to real peanut butter.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3 because it's only 45 calories for 2 TBSP! The outstanding nutritional stats make up for it!

review/summary: Peanut butter minus the guilt!
review/text: I LOVE peanut butter.  I am the kind of person who will eat it out of the jar with a spoon, all by itself!  I like it that much.  Needless to say, this love affair is dangerous for the waistline.  Enter PB2, with 45 calories per 2-tbsp serving--an absolute godsend!  I tried and liked the plain version but this chocolate one is even BETTER!  It's not just chocolate flavored, there are actually tiny little granules of chocolate goodness in it, like micro-mini chocolate chips.  Yum!  Sure, it takes a bit of mixing and experimentation to get the consistency just right, but in the end it's great as a peanut butter stand in, either in recipes, as a dessert topping, or yes, even all on its own.  I love this and love that I can indulge my inner peanut butter fiend without too much fear of having to buy new pants.

It's just a little grainy, but that's to be expected when mixing a powder.  I like dipping fruits and veggies in it!  It's definitely satisfying, I'm just going to look at other buying options, b/c the price here is pretty astronomical for such a small amount. Only giving 4 stars for this reason, but it's a 5 star product!

review/summary: Feeding my sweet-tooth AND shrinking my waistline!
review/text: I'm not worried about my fat intake at all, but I love peanut butter and would easily eat 400 peanut butter calories daily.  I'll eat a spoonful by itself, put a couple in a smoothie...  With the same amount of PB2, I'm eating 90 calories.  That means I can dip apple slices & dark chocolate, eat spoonfuls, and still put some powder in my smoothie without gaining 2 pounds a month.<br /><br />I bought one bag of chocolate and one of regular and mixed them together (thinking if it was nasty, the chocolate would help it taste better).  It actually tastes really good! My boyfriend says he can't tell that it's not regular peanut butter (I can tell) and that he prefers the powder to real peanut butter in shakes and smoothies. (I make fake ice-cream all the time by blending ice, almond milk, banana, and pb2).<br /><br />Honestly, the powder doesn't taste the same. However, it is close enough to make me keep eating it instead of the real peanut butter in the cupboard.  I like that I can make it as creamy or as thick as I want, and I have to say ignore the picture that someone posted here, because it really doesn't look that nasty!<br /><br />I took a chance buying the larger bags because it's cheaper by weight, and I am not at all disappointed. PB2 is well worth the money and I will be buying it regularly.

review/summary: Not Peanut Butter, Peanut Flavored Peanut Butter
review/text: I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again "regular" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else.

But the directions state for 2 tbsp at a time and that is about right for one serving.
