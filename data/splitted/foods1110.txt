review/summary: I MISS THE OLD OVALTINE!!!!
review/text: I am so disappointed in the new improved flavors of Ovaltine.  Why would they change a good thing?  I won't drink it anymore.  The LEAST Nestle could have done was offered the traditional flavors ALONGSIDE the new improved flavors so consumers could pick.  I don't like Nestle for doing this.

review/summary: Wow, so disappointed.....
review/text: Wow, I haven't had Ovaltine in quite some time.  I decided to buy some the other day and what an absolutely disappointing glass of milk that was.  It doesn't even taste anything like it used to.  Too bad they changed their formula from the original.  I don't know why people want to change a classic.  I guess it is ultimately their loss.

review/summary: Brought to you by the non nutritious Nestle brand
review/text: I finally got around to reading the Ovaltine container to see why this tasted thinner.  What do you know!  It is no longer a drink you can feel good about, just another chocolate milk flavoring.  Whereas previously two cups gave nearly a days worth of vitamins and minerals, they now have to compare it to basically apple juice,to make it look healthy.  What is the point? New Coke it is, except this appears to be done only to cut costs.  Sure wish I hadn't stocked up before I read the label.  Guess while it was off the shelf for awhile they were busy ruining a perfectly good product.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M050YI">Ovaltine Chocolate Malt Drink Mix, 12-Ounce Container (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: vs. Carnation Instant Breakfast (focus: artificial ingredients)
review/text: I have been consuming Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials (Rich Milk Chocoloate) daily for about a year now.  I decided to try Ovaltine for a change, as its price tag in the grocery store reflected slightly better value.  For some reason, I did not fully read the ingredients and instead focused only on the nutrition information, which compared decently.  Tried it for the first time this morning, and my observations follow: stirred into a glass of almond milk (which is slightly less viscous than regular milk) and it dissolved better than Carnation, less grainy.  Drank glass, noticed sediment at the bottom, even after a good stir, but much less  of it and a smoother consistency than what I regularly get with Carnation.  Flavor was fine, although it tasted a little more artificial tasting than Carnation, though I expect this from any "instant chocolatey drink."<br /><br />At this point it was 50/50, and I leaned toward switching to Ovaltine only because there are more servings per the 1.1 lb. package.  My true disappointment came when I read the ingredients and noticed "mono- and diglycerides, artificial vanilla flavor, yellow 6, red 40, blue 1."  These are just not necessary.  Value or no, I'm not switching. Carnation does not have food coloring added to it, and while there are still big chemical words on the list, they mostly seem to be the vitamin and mineral additives.<br /><br />Nestle, one of the world's largest food producers, has three major "instant chocolately drinks" on grocery shelves around the world. (Ovaltine, Carnation, Nesquik).  I can't imagine a good reason why one should contain such artificiality. Once I find a better way to get these same calories regularly throughout the day in a quickly digestible and palatable manner, I will stop buying these altogether...

review/summary: New Ovaltine is Yukky!
review/text: I don't understand why they would do this. They have had a tried and true product since 1906 and the corner on the rich malty flavored beverage market. If they wanted to compete with other sickeningly sweet chocolate beverages, just slap a new name on it and keep the market they already have. If I'm going to be kicked to the curb, it sure would be nice to have my old ovaltine back. Creeps!

review/summary: Ovaltine so far THE BEST!
review/text: The previous reviewers are not happy with Ovaltine because of the change of flavor and texture.  I noticed a small change of flavor.  The texture of the dry powder is about the same not too grainy but not too thin.  I have to agree that it really doesn't dissolve in cold milk completely, like they mentioned.  Despite all that nobody could get me to actually enjoy a glass of Nesquik.  If I had to choose; I'd choose Ovaltine because it still tastes better by a long shot.<br /><br />Have you tasted Nesquik hot?  Eww!  o_0<br /><br />To give it a last chance, try the Ovaltine hot, if you really think the slight change of flavor makes such a big difference that you'd rather not have any chocolate milk at all, then I'd say you're out of luck.  I can't think of any chocolate powder better than Ovaltine.  Hershey's chocolate powder used to beat all the others in the 80's, but those days are over; it's just average now.  The Carnation Instant (breakfast) drink is disgusting. :(

The thing I love the most about this product is that it is soap-free and my dog doesn't get dandruff from it. Other dog shampoos irritate my dogs skin and make his coat and skin dry, causing him to have lots of dandruff after a bath. Not this shampoo! I'm tempted to use it on my own hair. :)

I just went and bought more at the grocery store, and fell in love all over again.<br /><br />If you like Reese's peanut butter cups and KitKats, try these, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Dear ReeseSticks Crispy Wafers... why are you so yummy?
review/text: This is the diet killer. The King Size version of this candy packs a whopping 440 calories and 10 grams of saturated fat. You heard right, half your suggested daily serving of saturated fat in four little wafer bars. But oh, are they so good. These are my guilty obsession.<br /><br />If you've never had them, the ReeseSticks have very little in the way of chocolate - just a thin coating over the wafers. Multiple layers of wafers are sandwiched together by the Reeses peanut butter'esque filling, so the first taste impression you get is peanuts, then an overtone of general "sweet". Personally I like this bar because it's not overly sweet like a Snickers or Mars, but don't kid yourself into thinking that the peanut butter aspect somehow makes this bar healthier than its super-sugary compatriots... it doesn't.<br /><br />...so good.

Not surprising since they are both made by Hershey (although outside the U.S. Kit Kat is made by Nestle).<br /><br />But the main reason I am writing this review is to praise the seller (Free Shipping Tigers). I had reservations about ordering the product because of the summer heat & the horror stories you hear about online candy being stale. I ordered this on a Sunday afternoon in June, it was shipped the next day & delivered Wednesday. The expiration date on the candy is March 2013 so I am very satisfied with this seller!

review/text: I see many of the reviews of this product were for PUPPIES.  Maybe they aer good for PUPPIES, but NOT FOR DOGS!!  I purchased 6 Quado dog bones. The dogs loved them and devoured them in only an hour. I was disappointed and disturbed that they went so quickly and went back to read the packaging to find a small blurb on the back of the package on the bottom right "Quado is to be consumed over a period of time and not in once sitting or even on day." (1) I paid about $8 for each bone with shipping.  This was for a bone which lasted only an hour.  I expected it to be a "bone" not a "treat."  I could have taken my dogs out to dinner for that price.  (2) If the bone is meant to be consumed over time, please make that obvious on the front of the package and not in some small print on the back.  It worries me now why they printed the statement on the back.<br /><br />I can appreciate the fact that they created environmentally-friendly products and trusted that I would be satisfied with my purchase.  I buy the best for my dogs despite not being a wealthy person.  I bought these bones because the shape is a great design.  I expected a bone that would last.  I am disappointed.  I would requested a refund for my purchase price. I have yet to hear from the company N-Bone.

But...a deer antler is more expensive and my dog didn't lose interest in this so I'll be buying it again.  My cane corso is also a pup so older dogs may not be excited about sitting down and eating the entire thing.  On the flip side, my corso isn't hyper but likes to have fun.  We are working on him entertaining himself and this definitely kept him entertained without making a mess.  My corso did have fun flipping it around and tossing and watching it settle after a few rolls.  Good toy all in all.  It may last longer for different breeds or dogs of a different age.

review/summary: Gone in under ten minutes
review/text: While my dog enjoyed this chew very much, he devoured the whole thing in under ten minutes. 40 pound Australian Shepherd that I would not describe as a particularly aggressive chewer, finished the 'average' says much faster than I expected. I thought the material would be harder and more difficult for them to break off pieces. It's probably great for small dogs, but too much money for something I wanted to last for much longer.

review/text: This may be an expensive chew (as other reviewers have mentioned), but it is still cheaper than furniture or shoes. When my lab puppy has this Quado available, he goes for THIS, instead of forbidden chews. In fact he goes for this over any other chew I have offered him.

review/summary: My dog LOVES it!
review/text: I have a 9 month old cairn terrier that absolutely LOVES it. We usually give it to him when we will be away for a while and he spends the whole afternoon chewing on it. I've given it four stars just because it leaves a beige stain on the carpets (which I clean using the PETCO stain and odor removal and works like a charm). Other than that, it's a wonderful chewing toy and lasts a long time (at least for my 11 lbs dog).

review/summary: So much money, so little time ...
review/text: I gave these bones five stars, because our dog absolutely loves them. But, therein lies the problem. On the package it states your dog should not consume these in one sitting (look at the small print), but your dog will not agree with the package instructions. While "Bella" is quite fond of these and so I might purchase them again, it only takes her about 20-25 minutes to polish one off. They are not like rawhide, where they can last for quite some time because your dog will chew, then take a rest, then chew, etc. These are like dog "drug" bones. Like catnip for a cat. And we have not been following the "instructions" on the package. To take this away from our dog after 5 minutes so the bone will last over several days, is counter-productive and when you see how much tail-waggin' your dog does over them, even cruel.

review/text: I use wellness dry cat food on my 5 year old cat and she loves it. Most people don't know good cat food from bad, there is so much hype about cat chow and food like that because there are so many advertisements about these foods. If only people knew how bad they were. Wellness cat food is very healthy and the cats love it! I work at a pet supplies store and whenever customers ask me to recommend them a good cat food my first suggestion is always wellness. Yes it is a little more expensive than others but you will be happy when your cat lives a healthy life and you dont have so many vet bills to pay off. Overall I have had nothing but great things come from feeding my cat wellness.

review/summary: My Cats Love Wellness
review/text: After all of the pet food scares a few years ago, I switched to Wellness, which at the time, was a smaller producer of pet food.  I was attracted to the all-natural ingredient list.  But what really mattered was the safety of my cats and this brand had been the subject of any recalls that I was aware of.  Luckily, my cats love it.<br /><br />It is more expensive than grocery store brands or even the premium versions of the name brands, but it is worth it to me.<br /><br />I also think that a diet of Wellness all-natural ingredients has made and ocntinues to make my cats feel, look, and act younger than their ages.  Your mileage may vary, but I gladly pay for Wellness quality.

review/summary: Very Nice Concentrate
review/text: I drink tea all the time. I used to brew it but found tea concentrates much easier and just as good. It can be made by the gallon or by the glass. Plus, you can change the strength to suit your mood, strong or weak.<br /><br />Sweet tea concentrate is relatively easy to find in most grocery stores but is often too sweet for my tastes. Unsweetened is not so easy to find. When my local tea concentrate supplier discontinued my unsweetened tea concentrate, I started searching for an alternative online.<br /><br />I found Island Rose Southern Style Tea Concentrate here at Amazon. I was a little concerned, as I'd never heard of the brand. I've tried off brands before and usually found them tasteless or too bitter. Island Rose turned out to be great! It has a very mild, smooth fresh brewed tea flavor with no bitter after taste. I really enjoy it.<br /><br />But be careful. I neglected to read the description carefully. The tea concentrate I used to buy came in gallon bottles and cost around $12 (plus tax). With the 11:1 mixture ratio that came to around $1.18 per gallon.<br /><br />Island Rose Southern Style costs $18 plus shipping, an extra expense I was willing to pay for gallon bottles, but this is actually HALF gallon size. For the price, this tea comes to around $4.00 a gallon mixed.<br /><br />So, its really great tea, excellent flavor, very smooth, but just a little too pricey for me.

I bought one of the "Farmers Market" from the regular grocery store to make sure my 8 month old liked it, which he did. I bought a case from Amazon, but the consistency was like soup, very runny unlike the one I bought from the store. Heating it up made it worse. Maybe it was a fluke, but the second case from Amazon ordered a few months later had the same problem.

This assortment is great for those looking to try something new or for those who already are fans that want to try different flavors. My only "con" is that I wish the squares were a little bigger. But at this price, it's perfect!!

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I have a love for Japanese sweets, particularly those made with red bean paste, but I haven't tried Yokan until I bought this little pack. That being said, I suppose I don't know what Yokan "should" taste like.<br /><br />But I must say, these taste wonderful to me! They are quite sweet actually, and I can't eat more than half a bar at a time. A few reviews note a grainy texture or whole beans, but I've found quite the opposite to be true. All of them in my batch are very smooth textured, and I've only found a single whole bean so far. My personal favorite is probably the matcha or the plain red bean. I could do without the salty flavor, but by no means is it awful or inedible.<br /><br />Obviously these are very overpriced. I don't have an Asian grocery anywhere near me, so I paid the insanely high price here anyway. I've found the same brand of Yokan elsewhere online for much cheaper now, but this was the cheapest way I could try small amounts of many flavors.<br /><br />I do want to add that I don't appear to have received the persimmon flavor. From what I can figure, the flavors I have are: Red Bean, Cream, Salty, Matcha and Chestnut. I'm going off of minor knowledge of Kanji, so I could be wrong. Just thought it was worth noting.

They have a good texture, sweet but not too much so, and it was filling.  I gave it 4 stars only because they are very expensive.  Living in a small town, I dont have any Chinese or Japanese grocery stores where I might be able to purchase them for much less.  If I eat one each day, the cost for 30 would be $46.20 per month.

review/text: These are like most other traditional Japanese sweets - a derivative of Chinese sweets that have had all the flavour taken out.<br />The azuki one looks innocuous enough, but the texture is rather disgusting. It looks smooth, but in fact contains rough skins of the beans, and once that shock has passed, you're left with a kind of bland earthy flavour offset by mild sweetness. Why would anyone eat this anymore, this strikes me as a food for poverty-stricken times.

review/text: I can't believe that a packaged cookie can taste so good but these are about perfect. They are a dark cocoa-flavored cookie with chocolate chips, but they are not gooey or overly sweet. It's a rather crisp, hard biscuit with solid chips and it tastes of a very good quality dark chocolate/cocoa mix. The problem is, it's hard not to eat three or four of these at a go. If you are making up a gift basket for a friend, you could throw in a few packages of these along with a gourmet coffee and some of those flavored, stable flavored coffee creamers. And a pretty mug. You'd have a very nice gift.

review/text: We really like Velveeta &lt;Velveeta Loaf, 32-Ounce Loaf (Pack of 3)> at our house.  We make grilled cheese sandwiches, and sometimes we put blocks of it in tomato soup or in salad.  There are countless ways to eat it.  One of our favorite ways is with Ro-Tel tomatoes and green chilis(RO*TEL Hot 10 oz 12 count).<br />My family and friends who contributed recipes to Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook used it in some tasty dishes. Mary V's Cream Taco, Frankie's Glorious Choux, and Zach's Shrimp Napoleon are three great recipes in that cookbook that require Velveeta.<br /><br />No cheddar cheese is as smooth as Velveeta, and nothing else will guarantee the creamy results of this cheese spread.  I don't know how it is possible to cook some dishes without it.<br /><br />We use it for smooth tasting dishes with the pretty results.

review/summary: Y U M M Y...C H E E S E....G O E S....O N....F O R E V E R ! ! ! !
review/text: VELVEETA CHEESE has been around a long time.  I'm a "baby boomer", and<br />I can't remember a time when it wasn't on store shelves.  I suppose that's one big bonus that comes along with this yummy cheese....it bridges generations, and allows two...or maybe even three, (or more!) generations of a family to talk about what THEY did with, and used, Velveeta for, when they were growing up...and in various stages of growing up!<br /><br />The taste hasn't changed....at least, not that I can tell.  Looking at the ingredients, though, I notice that colby cheese -- which I do remember once being listed amongst the ingredients -- is no longer there. Also, (and this is from Velveeta I got in the supermarket, where I believe<br />the turnover is faster than at Amazon.com....although I can't be sure) -- anyway, the Velveeta I got from the supermarket seems a bit less yellow, a bit more white-ish, than the Velveeta I got previously from Amazon....and the Velveeta I had as a child.  I suspect from this that perhaps Kraft Foods -- makers of Velveeta -- are now adding more milk to the cheese, to keep the price as low as it is?  Looking at the ingredients, I can't see where adding more milk, (or more of something else that makes the cheese whiter), would lower the production costs....but then what do I know?  All I DO know is that Velveeta Cheese...though it tastes the same, is a bit whiter than before.  The pretty orangy-yellow colour is still there....but lighter...  The cheese also seems the teensiest bit less firm than it used to be....  I surely hope that Kraft returns to at least the last previous version of Velveeta, (firmer, yellower, but without Colby), before the newer version I detected in the supermarket reaches Amazon.  (Or could it be that Kraft makes two versions...one for supermarkets, and one for Amazon?)  Whatever the situation, I would like strongly to entreat Kraft to make a "Deluxe Velveeta" version -- the original Velveeta as I remember it from the 1950s: very yellow, much, much firmer, and using Colby cheese as one of the ingredients!  With a price midway between "modern" Velveeta, and "natural" cheeses, (perhaps on a par price with Kraft Deluxe American Cheese....or perhaps even a LITTLE higher -- and the words "ORIGINAL Velveeta Cheese Formula" on the package....it is sure to be a hit with all 21st century Velveeta fans...as well as those, like me, who remember it from the 1950s.  (Maybe there was even a version before the 1950s?  If so, please let THAT version be labeled "The Original Velveeta Cheese"....I know I'd be very eager to try it!<br /><br />That aside, it still tastes exactly the same as always -- at least to my palate, which remembers only as far back as the 1950s.  I have recently  heard from a friend,  that many people are "down" on Velveeta cheese --saying it's not real cheese.  OK -- it's not 100% natural cheese...additives have been, er...added.  But then the same is true of "Kraft Cheese", and many cheeses of Bordon and other manuacturers as well.  To get "natural" cheese, one always must pay a premium...and to get "organic natural" cheese, one finds it more expensive still.  (To get a middle-price, I bought "Kraft Deluxe American" Cheese from Amazon, recently. It was firmer, and had more natural ingredients.  But that wonderful, Velveeta TASTE was not there.  The Kraft Deluxe American Cheese, for all it's other virtues, had a flat taste, compared with the slightly-tangy, delicious flavour of Velveeta.  Although I might buy Kraft Deluxe American Cheese in the future, I will probably buy a LOT more Velveeta!<br /><br />And yes...Velveeta still melts...wonderfully! Just cut it in a few pieces, (no tiresome grating, as with other cheeses), and it will melt almost instantly!  (But the decreased firmness in the cheese, now, makes grating it -- for the "purists" who want even Velveeta to melt as fast as possible -- somewhat too easy: it falls apart too quickly during the grating process!<br /><br />I notice, on the end of the Velveeta package, an invitation to try two other varieties of the cheese: Velveeta 2% Milk, and Velveeta Pepper Jack.<br />Is the Pepper Jack variety the same as the "Mexican" variety was a few years ago?  I see no mention o "Mexican" Velveeta on the package, and do remmber having it once, and finding it delicious -- but it was a while back, and I don't remember the flavour, exactly.  Is the new "Pepper Jack" variety the same, or different?<br /><br />Velveeta Cheese, I find, is great for sandwiches!  And it makes a pretty good 'macaroni and cheese' dish, too.  However, I must here admit that the BEST 'mac and cheese' I ever had was when I used 'Kraft Cracker Barrel' Cheddar Cheese with macaroni.  (Just like Velveeta, the Kraft Cracker Barrel Cheese comes wrapped in foil. This is perhaps more imporant with 100% natural cheddar cheese, (as Cracker Barrel Cheese is), because cheddar cheese dries up a LOT faster, even in the refrigerator, than Velveeta does.)  But for everyday sandwhiches....and even for fondu...Kraft Velveeta Cheese is more than adequate...and more than totally yummy!<br /><br />It is also better, and more economical, I think, to buy Velveeta, or any other cheese, (or anything else), by itself, and NOT in a combination -- such as "Velvetta Cheese and Shells Dinner", (or ready-made, canned or foil-bagged tuna salad, for that matter.)  Even if one is REALLY pressed for time in the morning, it's still cheaper to make mac-and-cheese, or anything else, by one's self, and not have it pre-packaged. (Healthier, too.)  Some great memories can be made by making all the sandwiches, or mac-and-cheese portions, the family needs, on Saturdays and Sundays.  Then -- if a surprise is wanted -- wrap up each sandwich in aluminum foil, WITHOUT labeling them, (except for maybe people's names, so everyone will get their favouriteS).  I like Velveeta and tomato, and also salmon, and also tuna sandwiches.  So, I pick one of the aluminum foil wrapped sandwhiches from the freezer, (with only my name on it) in the morning.  By lunchtime, the sandwich has thawed out...and I'm delightfully surprized by what it is!  (The Velveeta package says, "For best results, avoid freezing"...but, wrapped in aluminum foil, for only 24-hours, to at most, a week, I have found the flavour doesn't vary very much at all.)<br /><br />The ingredients in Velveeta are:<br />  Milk<br />  Water  Salt<br />  Whey  Calcium Phosphate<br />  Milk Protein Concentrate  Lactic Acid<br />  Milkfat  Sorbic Acid as a preservative<br />  Whey Protein Concentrate  Sodium Alginate<br />  Sodium Phosphate  Sodium Citrate<br /><br />CONTAINS 2% OR LESS OF<br />  Salt<br />  Calcium Phosphate<br />  Lactic Acid<br />  Sorbic Acid as a preservative<br />  Sodium Alginate<br />  Sodium Citrate<br />  Enzymes<br />  Apocaratenal (Colour)<br />  Annato (Colour)<br />  Cheese Culture<br /><br />A "chemical feast"?  Not quite -- many natural ingredients, as you can see, are (also) included.<br /><br />(These ingredients are from a package of Velveeta I recently bought in the Supermarket.  The ingredients in the Velveeta boght from Amazon JUST MIGHT differ...slightly. Because, as I've mentioned, I suspect that this product, and most others, more more quickly off store-shelves than they do here at Amazon -- because many people either haven't discovered the wonderful convenience of shopping at Amazon, or don't yet have their own personal computers, and so the time to make careful shopping choices, (rather difficult when limited to 20 minutes at a library's computer.)  So, buy the "older" version at Amazon, if you can...I may be wrong, but I suspect that the formula for Velveeta has changed once again....and the newer one, (now mostly at supermarkets), is less firm, and less yellow in color, than the one I bought here, online.....<br /><br />But all in all, Velveeta -- any Velveeta -- with it's penchant for bringing generations together, its delicious, slightly piquant. taste, its wonderful, (and perhaps too good) quality of 'meltability', and 'spreadability'...all add up to a true "American Classic".  It would be great, as I have said for KRAFT to bring back "Original" formula Velveeta, (including the Colby Cheese)....but even now, Velveeta tastes JUST as I remember it.  So, one needn't go to a memorabilia store, and spend hundreds, and perhaps thousands of dollars, in an attempt to bring back the "good old days".<br />Just go to your local supermarket, (and/or go to Amazon.com!), and buy and eat VELVEETA Cheese!  Your taste-buds will remember...and so will you!<br /><br />5 stars....and 100 yum-yums, (or as many yum-yums as the number of eyars Velveeta has been around!)  : )'

review/text: Growing up, I have always loved cheese. Now me being a college student, I always search for good food that is easy and quick to prepare. I picked this product up at my local CVS just to try it. To my surprise this product is very delicious. Every individual package comes with a good amount. Unlike other products, the amount of cheese advertised on the cover is the amount you get. It is very cheesy and perfect for a cheese lover such as me. My mom took notice to how I love this product, and her being an amazing cook, she has come up various different ways to incorporate this product to other dishes. It goes great with meatloaf, dips, etc. The possibilities are endless.<br /><br />One thing that does bother me is not the product but the prices being offered here on amazon. It's beyond insane as to how overpriced this product is here. At my local cvs pharmacy this product goes on sale every other week for about two dollars a pack. My advice is if you really want to try this product, (which you should) your better off going to your local grocery or pharmacy and picking them up there.<br /><br />Hopefully my review helped you into trying this product because it is absolutely a delight.

review/summary: It melts well
review/text: I'm not a fan of Velveeta really. I prefer cheese to cheese foods. That said, I do use it more than I'd admit in public (well, this is public, but I'm reasonably sure none of my local friends read my reviews here).<br />The texture is something like a soft glue, it's very shelf stable until opened and it's fairly inexpensive. The taste is a bit tangy.<br />Where it excels is in how well it melts which is why I use it as a base for macaroni and cheese and cheese dips. I can slice off a hunk of this and put it in a pan with a bit of milk and let it all melt together then mix in the cheese of my choice and it all melts together wonderfully. Then I disguise the orange color by putting more real shredded cheese on top or seasoned bread crumbs. People compliment my amazing mac and cheese and because their taste buds are so attuned to boxed mac and cheese they have no idea it's not what my mother would have considered homemade at all.<br />Great for super easy kid cooking. Pop some in the microwave with a bit of salsa and some cheddar and you've got a topping for nachos. Also great for getting children to eat broccoli. Just melt some in the microwave and pour it over the broccoli.<br />Handy stuff really. I just can't get past the gluey texture and flavor to really accept it as cheese.

review/summary: Sharing
review/text: At fifty I do like many things that are au courant. Velveeta is yesterday, and is comfort to me. From a time if I could get a package, macaroni noodles, and some milk, I might survive the month. It isn't surprising I use this to make a dip for corn chips, nor is it particularly earth shattering that after surgeries a nice bowl of mac and cheese calmed tummies that hadn't eaten in twenty or more days trying to come back to normal.<br /><br />So what can I offer. Freda Vandervort taught me to make marcaroni and cheese<br />and it was simple. I still prefer it to grainy versions with expensive cheeses. Here's the scoop.<br /><br />Buy some good macaroni, large, and cook it until just tender. I usually make about three cups cooked, one uncooked. Drain put back in the pan. To that add about a cup of milk, a stick of butter, about a cup of chopped Velveeta. Cook and melt, stir and if you want it yummier add half milk, half cream or use half and half. I've taken this after cooking straight to the table. But I've also taken it, put it in a baking dish, shredded cheddar over the top or bread crumbs and baked awhile. And added this or that.<br /><br />But frankly I just like it sometimes and appreciate the product when my tummy is thinking of days gone by. My daughter today stated she loves macaroni and cheese, as I served it, so I feel good about that.

review/summary: Finally, a light clam chowder that tastes good!
review/text: I almost never review food items on Amazon, but for this one I had to. I've been looking for a delicious, light clam chowder for a long time now.<br /><br />First, let me just say, I think the gold standard for regular fat/salt clam chowder was Wolfgang Puck's brand. When that brand was sold to Campbell, the chowder stopped being made, much to my chagrin. So I looked at the other brands, trying to find a good substitute. Unfortunately, Campbell's isn't very good at all. Their broth (if you can call it that) has a weird, gloopy texture and an odor (some might call it a funk) that is quite unpleasant. Progresso's regular brand is pretty good, but is absolutely loaded with fat and salt. Also, the broth tends to "break down" (by this I mean separate into watery elements and cream globules) after ten minutes or so in a bowl with crackers. Store brands are even worse, just a giant bowl of salt.<br /><br />Since none of these were as good as Puck, I figured I might as well look for lighter options. If I'm not going to get the same flavor, I might as well cut the salt and fat, right? Again, Campbell's (both regular and "select harvest" brands) was not great. It was, actually, better than their full fat option, if only because it lacked the funky odor. But it was very bland and had a bad aftertaste. Healthy Choice was OK in terms of texture, but VERY bland in terms of flavor. Clearly, the removal of salt and fat was not compensated for.<br /><br />Now, in comes Progresso with their light option. Compared to their regular variety, the nutrition info is as follows (with original values in parentheses):<br /><br />Calories: 200 per can (360 per can)<br />Total Fat: 5g per can (16g per can)<br />Sodium: 1380mg per can (1720mg per can)<br /><br />Sugars are the same, and Protein gets a cut from 10g to 6g.<br /><br />So although it still is not "low salt" by any means, it is brought pretty well in line with Campbell's reduced salt line. The fat level is just as low as Campbell's light soups, too.<br /><br />The big difference in the ingredients seems to be in various fish powders and extracts. Lobster Powder, Shrimp, Crab Powder, Fish Powder, and Tuna Extract are new to the ingredient list. And guess what: it works wonders. The extra seafood flavor is very palatable, and makes up for the reduction in salt quite well. Whey Protein Concentrate (whatever that is) seems to be a thickening agent that has been added, too. Either way, this broth is delicious! Honestly, I tend to lick the bowl afterward, something I only ever did with Wolfgang Puck brand chowder. It has a very "Seafood Stew" sort of flavor to it, in the way that a good paella or linguine with clam sauce might.<br /><br />I am giving this 4 stars because they have reduced the number of potatoes and chewy clam pieces. It is a bit of a thin chowder as it stands. Crackers are definitely necessary to round this one out. But thankfully, the broth holds up pretty well over ten or twenty minutes in a bowl with crackers. There is also a bit of an aftertaste, though not as bad as the Campbell's brands.<br /><br />So, it's no Wolfgang Puck (still the best canned clam chowder for my money) but it is an acceptable and healthier substitute. Hopefully, Progresso tweaks the formula to make it a bit chunkier. But I'll pick this up on sale whenever I see it at the store.

review/summary: Delicious Low Calorie New England Classic
review/text: I am editing a previous review that I have to admit was negative about this great soup.  The first time I had this I really wasn't impressed but because I wanted more protein in my meal I added a can of clams which I didn't properly drain.  It was watery and barely edible.  Yesterday I decided that I had the cans yet to use so I opened a can just to get rid of it and after dumping the soup into the sausepan I could see that the consistency was wonderfully creamy with lots of potatoes and enough clams to be able to call it clam chowder.  I apologize to anyone who read my first review and chose not to purchase this wonderful soup.  I had a serving of this soup for lunch today.  I am on a 1200 (plus or minue) calories a day and I have made a commitment to stay this course for a year.  So far it has been 201 days and my weight loss of 40 pounds (for a 75 year old woman) is pretty good.  This delicious soup will help make the next 164 days easier.  Thank you Progresso!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I am on Weight Watchers' new program and this soup is only 5 points. That attracted me in the first place. But above all it is DELICIOUS! It doesn't taste light to me at all. It is very filling on its own, at least to me personally. I think it's also because it's satisfying, you feel like you're eating real food and not some diet crap. I'll probably subscribe to this stuff because I can't see myself not having it in the house at any given time.

review/summary: Favorite!
review/text: Being around 200 calories for an entire large can you really cant beat this soup. My absolute favorite of the Progresso Light line of soups. Have recommended this soup many of times to friends watching their caloric intake and will continue to do so. Plus, with my Amazone Prime membership I receive a 12 pack to my door(in 2 days) for around 2$ a can which is less than most grocery store prices..really cant beat it :)

review/summary: Ceres Mango Fruit Juice Blend - 33.8 oz Litre
review/text: I purchased this delicious juice to give it a try because I was getting a bit tired of ordinary juices.<br /><br />I wanted an exotic, all natural, preservative free, no artificial color, and no add sugar juice that was not thick nor syrupy sweet.<br /><br />This juice is delicious, upscale, and refreshing.  It is a blend of pear juice and mango puree, and it is pasteurized and filtered.<br /><br />Neither fruit has an overwhelming influence on its taste, but the blend creates a whole new flavor for your palate--smooth, refreshing, and delicious.<br /><br />Although you could serve it to your kids, this is not your kid's juice by no means.<br /><br />The juice is made in South Africa and is named after the region from whence the fruits grow--Ceres Valley.<br /><br />It comes in an Earth friendly waxed box that is recyclable.

review/summary: Chantaine Deluxe Black Raspberry Preserves
review/text: I have been buying this particular brand of Black Raspberry Preserves for several years at my local grocery store. When the distributor changed, they can no longer get ANY Black Raspberry products, and altho I looked at many markets in the area, no one else carried this brand, or anything Black Raspberry, either. I'm glad to have found my favorite brand and fruit on-line. Breakfast toast is now pleasant, again!

review/summary: Very tasty flavors!
review/text: This was a "Hmmm This item is on sale, and I like the other Lifesavers, so I think I'll try it" purchase. It turned out to be a very good decision. The flavors are quite different from the standard Lifesavers flavors and very tasty and refreshing. We regularly purchase lifesavers to have around the house, car, etc. The entire family enjoyed them and I would recommend trying Lifesavers Fruiteria out!

review/summary: Pom loves this brand
review/text: my picky pom loves this brand.  I rotate between 3 flavors (he won't eat same flavor more than 2 days).  I love that they are grain free, organic, and small enough for his tiny mouth. He has rejected several other "natural" dry or dehydrated raw dog foods -- Orijen, Addiction (he liked this for awhile), Canidae, Stella and Chewy's, etc. No digestive problems, no stinky breath (why would I want pizza or even fishy dog breath?).  I have tried all the Acana dry foods --I order the trial size so they stay fresh -- and the price is reasonable for the quality.

review/summary: my dogs LOVE it
review/text: I just started my dogs on this food 3 days ago and they love it.<br /> No trying to add things to get them to eat, they clean their plates.<br />I have used Orijen in the past and my dogs have always enjoyed that food. It is a bit too expensive for me since I also have to buy very good quality canned for my diabetic dog.<br />My daughter decided to try this since it is made by the same company as Orijen. With all the food recall scares lately, this company has a very good reputation, uses quality ingredients, they have their OWN factory and they have had no recalls.
