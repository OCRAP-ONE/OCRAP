review/summary: Gourmet Health Food for Your Furry Family Member
review/text: This product is one of the best we could find for our AKC Standard Schnauzer.  Stella and Chewy's has a great line of freeze-dried raw food for both cats and dogs that provide balanced meals in flavors pets finding appealing and tasty.  DogFood Advisor rates Stella and Chewy products 5 star.  Our now 8month old came home at 11 weeks and as she grew became a very picky eater.  We tried everything - checking first, of course, for independent ratings on nutrition and wholesomeness.  She is almost fully grown now, and a trim but athletic 40 lbs.  She gets a steady diet of Darford dry kibble (also rates 5 stars in independent review) mixed about half and half with any of the Stella and Chewy patties broken into pieces.  Duck-duck-goose-goose is by far her favorite choice, but she also gets surf and turf (salmon and beef), beef, lamb and chicken rotated in for variety.<br /><br />We're confident that we've got her on a healthy - if gourmet - diet that will sustain her weight, energy and coat for a long time to come.<br /><br />Five stars for Stella and Chewy's delicious, nutritious, freeze-dried raw foods.  This vendor has very competitive pricing with no tax or shipping fees for the 16oz 6-pack.  It's the lowest price per ounce.<br /><br />Thank you Gulf Coast Pet Supplies and Amazon Market!

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: My first impression of this roast was that it was bitter.  But the aftertaste was so compelling, it drew me to drink more.  And more.  And after about half a cup, I realized that the bitterness that I was tasting was nothing more than the flavor of fresh hazelnuts.<br /><br />I received a free sample of this by ordering through a third party website, and my reaction is that it is just so fresh.  I'm ordinarily not a fan of vanilla or hazelnut, so I made sure that this was one of the first I tried to get it out of the way.  But there is a high likelihood that I might order more.  I norally don't like my coffee bitter, but this bitterness was absolutely delicious.  And as I noted, the aftertaste left my mouth feeling almost refreshed.  And speaking of refreshed, I just can't get over how fresh this tasted.  I didn't think that flavor from a pod could be this good.<br /><br />After drinking a pod of a different flavor, I found that the bitterness wasn't from the hazelnut.  It is the coffee itself.  So while the aroma and aftertaste are quite good, I had to dock a star for the bitterness.

review/text: I've been buying these "bones" for my two small/medium size pups for a while now and they go banana's for them! Neither has ever had a problem with them and I like that they last a little longer than regular dog treats. I had been trying to find a natural alternative to greenies. With these, I break a medium bone in half each get's one half and it last's them about 15 minutes, pretty decent for a natural chew bone. They are pricey, but I think worth it!

review/summary: Only Chewie for Denna's Sheltie
review/text: My friend Denna adopted her Sheltie from us at Sheltie Rescue of Utah.  I was over her house the other day. I had brought some of Z-Chews to share with her boy, Duke.  She immediately told me that Duke doesn't like any chewies and she's tried a whole bunch.  He just leaves them laying around.  I said...well...I've got them here, it's a premium product with outstanding ingredients, so let's just see what happens when we offer him one.  You know the end of this story...Duke at first sniffed suspiciously but then ate the Zuke's Z-Chew.  Denna stood there like she was in shock.  So, we found a chewie treat that Duke likes and it's really good for him too.  Yeah!  I'm really sorry that someone else's dog threw up the pieces.  If that happened soon after eating the Z-chew then there was no time for anything to get digested.  Everybody's stomach is different...human or canine.

review/text: My little Lhasa loved these, but she threw up big balls of starch.  Apparently, this is such a common problem, Zuke's is soon taking this line off the market and releasing a new replacement product in the next few months.  Small dogs don't have the digestive track needed to process these.  They will be switching from the existing potato formula to a more digestible Tapioca line.<br /><br />I need to hand it to Zuke's though. I told them about the product, and they rushed to send me samples and refund my money.

review/summary: My Dog Loves Zukes Cranberry Bones!
review/text: Full disclosure: I haven't chewed on these bones myself--this review is based on what I perceive is my dog's opinion. ;-)<br /><br />Zukes cranberry bones are my dog's favorite bones, paws down. She seems like the other flavors, but the cranberry ones are the ones that literally make her drool as I had them to her. I love that they take quite a bit of time for her to chew (a couple hours), they don't stain the carpet and that they make her breath fresh and her teeth clean. She's a 45-50 pound Australian Shepherd and the small size is perfect for her. I've bought the medium for her in the past, which she loves, but it's really probably too many empty calories for her size, so I switched to the small. I'm very appreciative that they have a pleasant, slightly earthy, odor--so many dog treats smell really rancid, because there for, you know, dogs who are into stinky things. Also, my dog's got a sensitive stomach and has never had any trouble with any of the Zukes bones. While they're not cheap, they do what they're supposed to do, so I can't complain.

review/summary: My dog loves Zuke's Z-Ridge Bones.
review/text: My dog is crazy about these bones. They do a great job of keeping her teeth clean and the ingredients do not include a lot of the "garbage" found in most dental chews on the market. The medium size (recommended for 46-80 lb dog) only lasts about 20 minutes for my 55 lb. boxer mix. I prefer the large size (81 lbs. and up) for her. She can make one bone last for a day or two which is more satisfying to her and cost effective for me.

review/summary: I think he likes them.  But not as much as Greenies.
review/text: We have a little Maltese that is given a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews</a> every day.  I saw the Zuke's Z-Ridge and thought they might be a good alternative to the Greenies.<br /><br />I will say that our dog can be weird.  When he gets dry dog biscuits he will hide them, then go back later and eat them.  He does the same with these.  I don't know if that means he really loves them, or if he just feels kind of "meh" about them.  I will say that he devours his Greenies.<br /><br />If you look at cost comparison, these things are almost a buck a piece, while the Greenies are only about a quarter a piece.  That right there makes me want to stick with the Greenies.<br /><br />I do think they work for breath freshness though.  Every once and awhile I'll give him one of these if he's getting a case of halitosis.  The only problem is that he keeps hiding it for half a day before he'll eat it.  I also use these if the little guy keeps bugging me.  That way he'll hide it instead of bugging me ;)<br /><br />I do like the Zuke's brand.  He loves the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007A0AP8">Zuke's Jerky Naturals Dog Treats, Lamb, 6-Ounce</a>.  That's why I wanted to try these.<br /><br />In all, I would recommend these to your pet.  If you're looking for an economical way to spoil your pet then I would go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews</a>.

review/summary: Fantastic treat!
review/text: My dogs absolutely love these!  I have two dogs who can't have any grains at all, and one dog allergic to poultry, so discovering Z-Ridge bones was a wonderful thing.  The minis are perfect for my 10lb terrier, who has a tiny mouth (and consequently works on one of these for a few hours), but are just right for my insatiable chewers, two 15lb mixes (poodle and min-pin), although they chew them up within 10-15 minutes (size small keeps them busy longer, but it's easier to just buy one bag they all can have).  I read one review about these making their dog sick - like any hard treat, you should definitely keep an eye on your dogs when they're eating them, to make sure they're chewing the pieces.  They have never made my dogs throw up, and the ingredients used are all quite digestible (they're potato and vegetable-based).  However, if your dog is swallowing chunks without chewing properly, they'll vomit anything.  All in all, my dogs go nuts for these, in all flavors, and my neighbor's picky pitbull loves them too!

review/summary: Five stars, with caveat
review/text: My dog loves these!  He likes all the flavors, but carrot is his favorite.  He is allergic to corn and wheat, so he can't have greenies (fine by me, zukes is a better company anyway) or many other dental treats.  I give him a few per week and they make his breath smell nice for the day.  They shouldn't be used as a substitute for brushing your dog's teeth because they won't keep tartar build-up down and they shouldn't be given to dogs that "gulp" pieces, but if your dog chews before he swallows, these treats are a great option.  Thank you Zukes for making a dental treat my dog can have.

Those are just divine and oh so easy, this wonderful organic flour lets me have fun in the kitchen because I can bake and try out new stuff and still make it healthy since the fiber in this product is impressive. Just � cup has 130 calories, 1 gram fat, 0 saturated, trans fat, cholesterol & sodium, 150 mg potassium, 25 g carb, 4 grams fiber, 0 sugar and 4 grams of protein with some niacin and riboflavin per serving.<br /><br />Spelt is special and it's related to wheat; the earliest findings of it are from the 5th millennium BC, just north of the Black Sea in Transcaucasia. Europe munched on it for ages, I come from Europe but it was America that introduced me to it through British recipes, life is funny indeed! This grain has been traced from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age, it kept the human machine alive and growing so I figure it won't hurt to bake with it once in a while, turns out that the nutty taste and hearty bite aren't so hard to convert to, this can make delicious  breads, cookies or muffins, white flour isn't the only option anymore, the world of good grains lies in front of everyone, just takes a change and courage to cook with the ancient grains that have stood the test of time, the taste and health benefits are worth the try.  Spelt does contain gluten, which I don't have a problem digesting, just a fyi to bakers out there who have food sensitivities and allergies.<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/summary: Please amazon, NEVER STOP SELLING WHEAT GLUTEN! Wheat meat rocks!
review/text: I am soooo glad they have amazon in the age of gluten free mania. People who dont even have celiac disease are avoiding gluten and making this awesome meat substitute ingredient scarce! THANKS amazon! I made some wheat meat with this mix and it was great! Why spend tons of cash on gimme lean when you can make it at home? The answer is NO REASON! If anyone is curious look up wheat meat online, you can boil gluten and then you have a quality meat substitute! SOOOO cool. I am not always a vegetarian, but it IS healthier- I am about 90% veg these days and gluten has saved the day. It is healthier for my body and the environment- and thanks to amazon I can make wheat meat! yay! PLEASE dont stop selling this! These boxes are just right, they are an affordable starter pack for making your own wheat meat. You can add about a cup of water and your own seasonings per package and you knead it into a very very dense ball.It is great when it is really dense. You can twist it and make it into more of an oval. Boil for approx 2 hours, cool. Once it sets you can get an idea of what you are working with, it is a lot like many other meat substitutes. So cool. (UPDATE: I tried adding TVP, dont do it! Hah ha... Herbs are one thing, but your TVP will fall out, its a mess. Unless you want it to -which it is actually kinda cool because it makes the wheat meat hold sauces easilly... If that is what you want, little holes from falen TVP -go right ahead. Its a cooking tactic I suppose!)----I am so excited! Try adding marinades in the place of water. However much you use it should be dense (very) yet still pliable. After a test run on the first box you will be able to see how you would like your own texture. It does take about 1.5 to 2 hours to cook, so batch cooking is a must. After it is completely cooked you can refrigerate and it seems even better after it has been cold. It browns very fast after it has been refrigerated. Re-cooking in various forms is so fun! Stir frys, anything. Buying more gluten, may end up with this brand again because it is so afforadable.

review/text: I bought this to add to bread and to make seitan with.  It worked well for the bread, but my seitan just never seemed right.  It would still be lumpy and tough after kneading and never lived up to my expectations.  I figured I was kneading or cooking it wrong.  Once I used up all 8 boxes of Hodgson Mills, I ordered Bob's Redmill brand.  Woah!  Now my seitan comes out exactly like it is supposed to, and my whole wheat breads come out softer and more flexible than before.  I don't know if my case was defective or what, but I would not buy this brand again.

review/summary: A must-have for serious bread bakers
review/text: Add from one to four tablespoons of gluten to a bread recipe to make it reach new heights, especially for whole grains or for rye or other low-gluten flours. Hodgson Mill is a producer of quality ingredients for reasonable prices, and the package size is practical for most home bakers. I emptied one package into an airtight container for current use and put the other boxes in the freezer to maintain freshness, but that was probably more cautious than necessary. It will keep for quite some time on the pantry shelf.

review/summary: Very Good for Making Seitan or as a Bread Mix Additive
review/text: I bought this wheat gluten primarily to make seitan with, and I've had excellent results in the batch that I made. I flavored the gluten mix with various spices, simmered it in a ginger/soy sauce broth and sliced it into smaller pieces. The seitan came out great -- both when I pan-fried it or even just used it "raw" in a vegetable stir-fry. I've also used this gluten as an additive to my flour mix for bread-making, and it definitely results in a better loaf when added to the flour mix. So, all-in-all, this is good stuff. If it was organic, it would be the icing on the cake.

review/text: Although I originally started using vital wheat gluten many years ago as a bread enhancer, now I use it most frequently to make vegan meats such as sausages and veggie meatballs (but it is still a staple ingredient in my bread making). The subscription program through Amazon makes a great product much more affordable than buying it at the local chain grocer or health food store. Hodgson Mill is a quality brand, and I just hope it is always available this way through Amazon!

review/summary: Family declared the batch I made with this "the best loaf ever made"
review/text: I've been playing with bread recipes for about a year now, both by hand and in our bread maker. After really getting in to studying the science behind a good loaf, I began buying wheat gluten. Even if a recipe doesn't call for it I add a small amount (amount is listed on box of what to add to a loaf so it's failproof).<br /><br />The real test was when I added this to a sour cream bread I've been making for ages in our bread maker and everyone declared it "the best bread recipe" I'd made...but it was my old recipe.<br /><br />It really does make it more like the gourmet loaves you might scarf down at a favorite restaurant or like those made with fresh yeast when you are just using the dry yeast packets. It rises better, and the texture is better and I swear the taste is better in our opinion.<br /><br />I can't get wheat gluten at my regular grocery store and it was far more costly at specialty groceries around here...it lasts so I just got the box of it here, with no tax it was a better deal for me. I mean, you get a pack of 8 boxes. Cheap.<br /><br />Negatives: I'd love to be able to order less at the same discount but I took the bags out of the boxes and they take up very little space in my cabinet. I have no negatives on how it works: I don't make a loaf without it anymore.

review/text: I am using the HEALTHY BREAD IN 5 MINUTES A DAY cookbook and all recipes use vital wheat gluten. One box of this in the supermarket is double the price of one of these; so eight boxes for $10 and change is the only way to go. The expiration date on all boxes is 1 1/2 years (from today's date), so it will last a long time.  I called Hodgson Mills and they said to prolong the life even longer, it can be frozen. If you bake bread using whole grain flours, this is definitely a great savings!

review/summary: You Don't Need to Buy Bread Flour
review/text: For three years I've been baking whole wheat sourdough bread and I add this to the flour.  It beefs up the gluten a bit and gives the bread great crumb and texture.  Adding gluten powder to the dough and baking in a steamy oven makes my bread look and taste like a professional made it.<br /><br />If you're looking for little ways to cut your salt intake, know that you can reduce the salt in your recipe without fear of the gluten strands collapsing.<br /><br />Altogether I've baked breads for over 20 years.  I don't know how I did it without this stuff.  And you don't have to buy bread flour.  Adding gluten powder to all-purpose flour basically turns it into bread flour, and this little box takes up a lot less space than yet another bag of flour.<br /><br />Hodgson Mill always has fine quality in this product.  If you want to bake yeast breads, buy this!

review/summary: Improve Your Bread
review/text: Why Wheat Gluten? It's a cost saver when I make breads. Gluten is removed in the manufacture of general purpose flour. The main difference in "bread flour" at the store is that gluten has not been removed or it's been added back in.<br />Adding your own gluten to bread recipes is a more cost effective way of improving the texture of bread than buying the expensive "bread flour."<br />Hodgson Mill Vital Wheat Gluten works well and is moderately priced.

review/text: If you make bread at home, you've noticed that some loaves don't hold their shape very well.  Vital Wheat Gluten solves that problem.  Use one teaspoon per cup of all purpose flour, and your bread will hold its shape better during rising and baking.  No other changes to the recipe are required.  This product does not alter the flavor of the bread in any way.  I make bread every day, and am much happier with my results wince I've begun using gluten powder in it.

review/text: It works well with whole-wheat flour and any kind of all-purpose baking flour if you love home-made bread. It enables the bread to reach its fullness and the taste won't change because of the gluten. Suggest to use a bit more gluten to the flour when you make the dough. The ratio I use is: 1/2 cup of gluten per 3-cup of all-purpose or whole-wheat flour. An increasement of 1/8 cup of water to the dry ingredients is recommended.

review/text: I have always gotten my vital wheat gluten in baggies at the health food store. And I always run out since I bake a lot and the store is 45 minutes away. I looked at reviews for wheat gluten (thanks to all of you!) and decided to try this kind based on experience of other Hodgson Mill products.<br /><br />My first loaf just came out of the bread machine, and I'm really impressed. Perhaps it's the addition of the vitamin C (?) but using a recipe I've used dozens of times before, I know it came out better!<br /><br />Hodgson Mill recommends 4 teaspoons per loaf for bread machines. I've always used 1 tablespoon per cup of flour, so their advice is to use quite a bit less than I've done in the past. I decided to use half of what I normally do (a bit more than recommended), and it's perfect. Light and airy, it rose beautifully, no holes, etc.<br /><br />And the price? For eight little boxes that will last even me, who makes bread 2-3 times a week, will last and last. They recommend refrigerating it after opening, which I've never done. (one of those tips I didn't get at the health food store.) So, now I save money, have it delivered to my door, and never run out! Good deal!

review/text: We have a mini schnauzer. He is not picky. He does eat too fast and get gas if we get large kibble, but otherwise he is a goat. Today he woke and refused breakfast and treats. He just had his heartworm medicine and I have noticed that he is slow for a couple days after taking it each time - but not eating was alarming. I had a sample from a fair of this kibble and WAHLAH! Our pup rushed to eat this food like I have never seen and I was completely surprised I was about to give up on feeding him (he turned down SOJO raw food, dried fish skin, lamb liver treats, etc).<br /><br />1) This kibble is very high in Omega 3 which is important because he has flea allergies and even most expensive dog food don't put enough and have too much Omega 6. The extra Omega three keeps his coat shiny and skin more healthy.<br /><br />2) Importantly the kibble is tiny little bits perfect for small dogs and fast eaters. I really like the tiny oval shape.<br /><br />3) It contains probiotics (Bifidobacterium sp.) so if you have a dog that has trouble digesting, this helps your pup digest better and prevents gas. Yeah!<br /><br />4) It have no corn, wheat, beef, soy, or chicken -  top food allergens - so if you are looking for a food for a dog with food allergies this is a great candidate.<br /><br />I am not sure how it compares as far ae prices go with similar foods, but be decided to stock some for our pup incase he gets sick again because clearly this is better than treats! We might just use is for treating with training because it seems to be a high reward. He about ate the bowl!

review/summary: A Favorite Cat Toy
review/text: My cat adores this toy!  He gets needed exercise, chasing it along the floor and we spend hours each week interacting with it.  My only problem is the feathers don't stay attached.  I've re-attached them with SuperGlue, but it's probably my big cat's (15 pounds)fault as he's pretty rough on toys.

review/text: I bought these for my family with respect for Quaker and did not scrutinize the label.<br />They are filled with junk! High Fructose Corn Syrup is the second ingredient and brown sugar the third. They are so filled with junk ingredients that they have 43 carbs per bar with 38 in simple non-complex blood sugar raising carbs.<br />I've decided to feed these to the livestock down the road and not my family. Shame on Quaker. I will stick with the breakfast bars by Nature Valley and Kashi instead. Shame on Quaker. Childhood and adult obesity are epidemic. Oats are healthy except when slathered in high fructose corn syrup and junk carbs. Again Shame on Quaker.

review/summary: Best oatmeal cookies I've ever eaten!
review/text: I love WOW cookies and feel they are better than their 'wheat' counterparts by far. I have really never been a fan of oatmeal cookies until I tried these...all I can say is they are better than any I have ever made or eaten and that includes my mom's which are really good. One of the reasons I've never really liked oatmeal cookies is because most have raisins in them, which I do not like, but these have soft cranberries instead. The taste and texture is fantastic and you would NEVER know they were not made with wheat flour. Another soft and delicious cookie from WOW! Gotta love the name which stands for With Out Wheat.

My 7 year old has autism and food sensory issues, so getting him to eat veggies is very challenging for us. I saw this pasta in the grocery store and figured "What the heck. If my boys didn't like it, it would be good for pasta salad for me and my husband." Well we tried it and both my boys loved it! My 7 year old actually asked for seconds, which NEVER happens! It is a great way to sneak in a few extra veggies into a child's diet! I will definitely be making this my pasta of choice!

review/text: I ordered what I thought was five "4" packs of Smartbones medium size. What arrived was five "single" packs of the Smartbones medium size. The price for a four pack was a little more than half the local store price for the same items.... But for a single bone it works out to more than double the cost. I don't know if the problem is with the web/computer system or if the packer simply grabbed the wrong items. As I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon my only choice was to return the items. I'm afraid to reorder as I can't be certain the same mistake will not reoccur. Too bad as the price would be good and my dog loves the product.

review/summary: Good price, great tomatoes
review/text: I recently moved to a region where it is hard to find a lot of items to which I had become accustomed in the mid-Atlantic.  San Marzano tomatoes are nowhere to be found.  I ordered these because they were attractively priced and seemed authentic.  They did not disappoint.  They are equally good in pasta sauce as they are on pizza. The cans are small, which is also a plus since sometimes I've found I cannot use all of the tomatoes in the much larger cans.  Do not overanalyze this purchase-- if you are looking for flavorful, low acid tomatoes that don't taste like tin, buy these.

review/summary: Good flavor but not as plump
review/text: These cherry tomatoes have a nice flavor although they sort of "deflate" if you cook them for more than a minute.<br /><br />Even out of the can, if you pop one in your mouth, it feels hollow. Hard to describe. I added these tomatoes to a pasta primavera I made the other night and had to remove them from the heat after just a minute because half of them had already started to collapse.<br /><br />I shared this order with a friend so now I'm left with 11 cans and I think I'll use most of them in pizzas or to make quick sauces. And if that works out then I'll keep the Subscribe and Save on this item, otherwise I'll have to cancel.<br /><br />I can't recommend this product because, in my opinion, the tomatoes should be firmer and not collapse like these do.<br /><br />Also, these cherry tomatoes are not peeled.<br /><br />Prompt delivery, but six of the cans arrived dented.

review/text: I bought this tea based on a recommendation an online nutritionist who said it was an excellent tea to promote optimal health and longevity. I have been suffering from adrenal gland fatigue and therefore am not supposed to drink caffeinated beverages. I've substituted this tea for my morning chai and it makes me feel great. It contains gynostemma (http://www.gynostemma.org/) an herb that contains more healthy saponins than any other available. This tea is consumed throughout China and is believed to be responsible, in part, for the longevity of those who drink it. While I can't speak to that, I certainly can say that I feel good when I drink it. And I sleep very soundly even if I drink it in the afternoon. The taste is quite nice, naturally sweet, so you don't need to add any sweetener, which is nice.

Combos in general are an excellent option for those who are tired of chips or crackers-they are packed with flavor, and don't give your fingers the "Cheetos" residue, plus you can eat them without wearing chip/cracker crumbs within the process.<br />Unfortunately, it cannot be found locally for us, so Amazon is our only option. (Love Amazon, they just seem to be out of stock on the Pepperoni Pizza ones more often than in stock, in all sizing options.) If they are in stock (or if you can find them locally), you should try them, they are well worth it!!

review/summary: Tastes great, but it DOES contain MSG
review/text: I use chicken broth in many dishes - rice, casseroles, stuffing, soups, noodle dishes - so I like to keep a case of it in my pantry.  We like Swanson chicken broth because it contains natural ingredients, and the flavor is surprisingly rich for being 99% fat free. The cans open easily with a pull top, and the 14 oz. can is the perfect size for many recipes.<br /><br />However, this broth does contain a form of MSG - Autolyzed Yeast Extract.  If you do a little research on the Internet, you'll find that many foods that claim to be MSG-free actually have it hidden within other ingredients.  Go to TruthInLabeling dot org to read the many names for MSG.  I'm giving a product I really like three stars because of this deceptive practice.<br /><br />I ordered this broth using the Subscribe & Save option, which saved me 15% off the purchase price, and included free shipping.  If I find a broth or stock that truly is free of MSG, I will update this review to share the name of it.

review/text: I love Swanson Chicken broth.  It is a quality product and I can trust the brand.  I use it in my soups and even to substitute water when I cook rice to give it a little more flavor.

review/text: I have tried several brands of potato pancake mixes and none have the outstanding favor as Streit's.  I'm having trouble finding stores that carry this product. ( Wal-mart supercenters, Krogers, Walts, etc.)
