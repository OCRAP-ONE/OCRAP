review/summary: Favorite mints
review/text: I almost always have a roll of mints of some sort in my purse.  After a meal I always reach for something to freshen my breath.  I don't really care for chewing gum -- don't like how people look when chomping away on it and I never quite know how to dispose of it when finished -- therefore mints are the solution.<br /><br />Over the years, I have tried many varieties and some I have liked better than others but these are the best!  I love the combination of the harder outer shell with the soft, chewy insides.  The flavor is powerful enough to do the job and I actually really like the taste.  I am not the only fan in my family.  My teenage daughter has them stashed in her car and her backpack.  When she runs out, she jokes she is having a "Mentos crisis".  We love them and friends I have shared them with also seem to like them.

review/text: When they are fresh they can not be beat. When they are a little past their prime they are still very good. They have a strong mint presence and it leaves the mouth feeling somewhat refreshed and with a minty taste. Do not know if they could alternatively help with the occasional bad breath problem that afflicts anyone at one time or the other. They certainly feel strong enough to convey security in that department and if Mentos wanted to corner the market they should make sure it can also combat the annoying and always irritating (to the ones in the other end) episodes of an unkempt mouth, which is not to say that in some cases is unavoidable and soon enough remedied by the conscientious bearer.<br />Mentos Mint Candy, 1.32 Ounce Rolls (Pack of 30) was the best deal in terms of quantity versus value. What at first might appear as over doing it in the numbers ends up being just right. Enough to say that the fresher the shipment the better because that is the time when the flavor is at its peak. This is the one flavor by mentos that delivers a flavor full of fresh mint and it last right until it is gone. Imagine, if only for a minute, if besides helping to kill the germs that cause bad breath they could also be healthy to the teeth by adding Xylitol which has been proven to greatly reduce cavities and preserve teeth in general. I am probably dreaming but I see Mentos Mint like powerhouses in their own right.<br />4.5 Stars for these mints!

review/summary: EXCELLENT Taste and Consistency
review/text: The PB has a great taste, smooth, creamy and very crunchy and more roasted taste compared to Skippy or Peter Pan Natural PB spreads. AT $1.90 1/2 PER jar not store can come close. On average it is $3.50-$4.50 a jar in most grocery stores and even the evil Walmart/Target can't compeat here.<br /><br />For all of you reviewers that gave it one star...... Did you return it?  As you have 30 days to return products to Amazon for a refund, if you didn't open any of the jars you could have easily done so.<br /><br />JIF as well as SKIPPY and other non-stir Natural Peanut Butters clearly state they are spreads and that they do not contain trans-fats.  It is better than regular PB yes, is the healiest; NO but still better than the regular and ingredients clerly listed. As for expiration, why would you buy a case of any food and not expect to use it in a relatively short period of time?<br /><br />When I bought cases I used them to make cookies for the holiday, other desserts as well as the old stand by of PBJ and I am one person.  Even if I hadn't baked with many of the jars as I did the small 18oz containers (6 per case) would easily be used in 3-4 months max.<br /><br />Lastly why would you not also check out in your local store to read the ingredients, look at average expiration dates as well as know your own use of a product.  Meaning on average you use 1 18oz jar of PB in 2 weeks, or 2 months.....<br /><br />As for the Palm Oil and the actual location that JIF buys that or tracing it back to what one reviewer said I can not comment. If it were true that is awful and yes, things need to change to protect many natural environments around the globe but that would include dozens upon dozens of firms globally that use Palm Oil to act. Not buying this isn't the strongest message that reviewer should be using social media and actual letters to JIF to help change actually happen.<br /><br />Do your homework when you buy things, regardless if it is food or electronics.... Amazon has just about the best return policy online or in a store and they always listen and or work with you to come to best outcome/satisfaction.  For all you complainers you have no one to blame but yourselves.

It's too bad that Amazon raised the subscribe and save price.  It used to be $12.66 for the 6 which made it worth it because it totalled less than at the store.  Now, at $14 for 6 it's actually more than the grocery store price even with tax!  If the price goes down again I'll certainly buy it from Amazon.  Until then...

review/text: This stuff is awesome. My husband was talking to someone at work about how we had given up on "natural" peanut butter because it was a pain to stir and didn't taste as good... and they bought him one of these. I never thought I'd review peanut butter, but honestly this is the best peanut butter I've ever had. And I didn't even think I liked crunchy peanut butter.<br /><br />Checked the label, looks like they replaced the standard trans fats (or in the case of other natural peanut butters, unsaturated fats, which is why you have to stir) with palm oil, which is solid at room temp.

review/text: I bought this a few weeks ago when it was on sale. I guess we haven't had crunchy peanut butter for awhile because the first thing I thought when I tried it was how many peanut pieces are in it. It is harder to spread but tastes great.  It really is crunchy. I have had problems with the Skippy Natural separating and the Jiff hasn't. I also like the fact that it doesn't have the lip on the bottom like Skippy does that makes it hard to get out every last drop. And with peanut butter prices sky high, I want every drop out.

review/summary: Natural Crunchy... Find or fad?
review/text: "Natural" peanut butters are an interesting trend, especially since the nutrition facts on the label are generally identical to traditional peanut butter, but since I'm making an effort lately to feed my kids more foods that come from a farm and fewer that come from a lab I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />There is a pretty big difference in taste and texture between this natural and "regular" peanut butter. Though the label is fairly unconvincing (it still contains sugar, palm oil, salt and molasses as well as peanuts) you can tell that something major changed. This is thicker and a bit trickier to spread, especially the chunky variety (natural creamy is also thicker, but not as difficult to spread) the peanuts stick and it's pretty tough to make an even layer on bread unless you really use a lot.<br /><br />The flavor is much more like real peanuts, I like it better but you may have to get used to it if you're really into "regular" peanut butter.<br /><br />There is also a little oil separation, but not enough to be a problem.<br /><br />Overall, I'm a fan. It seems like traditional peanut butter contains more sugar and oil, which is basically frosting, and even though the fat content is the same or very close, I still suspect the fat and calories coming from real peanuts are more healthy, and the taste is definitely more authentic. However, I don't imagine this is going to appeal to everyone, especially those used to the taste and consistency of regular peanut butter, or those who don't want to pay the extra cost. I prefer natural, but I'm not giving up regular peanut butter completely.

review/text: When it comes to breakfast cereal, I can't think of any type that I enjoy more than Cheerios.  They have a delicious taste, I never seem to get tired of eating them, and best of all, they are fairly healthy as well.  The crunchy, slightly powdery taste of Cheerios has a certain quality that can't be described except to say it is delicious, and when one looks at the vast array of sugar-overload cereals available now, Cheerios remain a steadfastly healthy way to start a day.  Healthy for your heart, your diet, your well-being; what more can you ask?  Also, they make a great snack at any time of the day.  There's not much to diss about Cheerios- there's a reason they've been around for almost 70 years.

This cereal is low on sugar and tastes good, even if it is a bit bland.<br /><br />However, if you're considering buying cereal on Amazon, watch the price. It will fluctuate pretty wildly. I'm not saying this because I think a bunch of folks are going to spend money without realizing it. I say this because the price will occasionally drop to under a couple bucks a box, making it a great deal.<br /><br />Also, grab the 15% off using Subscribe and Save. If you want, the subscriptions are easy to cancel, and there is no commitment to buy a second round so it is basically free money.

review/summary: MY FAVORITE.
review/text: Cheerios are the first breakfast cereal I can remember eating.  Other than Grapenuts, it is the only one I still eat.  As my memory of these go back to just after the war (WWII) that is a lot of Cheerios over the years.  This is one of the few products that I know of that they have not messed around with and as far as I can tell, they taste the same to day as they did when I had my first bowl.<br /><br />These things are cholesterol free with no saturated fats.  There are no added colorings or flavor.  They are just about perfect as such things go.  In addition to being a breakfast staple, they are also almost always my "going to bed snack"...a habit I have had for years.<br /><br />These are also one of my favorite munching foods.  When reading I normally have a box next to my reading chair which to be honest, beats the heck out of pork rinds, potato chips or Moon Pies. The dogs seem to enjoy them as much as I do.  I also do a lot of traveling via automobile and I always have a box or two of these with me to eat right out of the box.  They tend to keep me from turning into every fast food place I encounter and they are great for keeping you awake during long trips, in particular at night.<br /><br />These are a wonderful and traditional cereal and I do hope they stay around for a long, long time.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

Not only because it's healthier but I like the taste as well. But...what is going on with Amazon's pricing? I paid $10.88 for these 4 boxes of Cheerios just 2 months ago (with the subscribe & save option) and at first they raised the price by less than a dollar and then again the same but now the price jumped all the way to $16.25? That's more than $4.00 a box and considerably more than it costs in any of my local supermarkets. If the price doesn't drop back down I'll be cancelling my subscription. Too bad because I really loved the ease of subscribe & save.<br />(3 stars because of the huge price hike, otherwise the Cheerios would get a 5 star rating)

review/text: I never thought this day would come. I left you, Cheerios, years ago when I thought there could be something better for me, something sweeter. People made fun of us, calling our love "puppy love". They even called you baby food.<br /><br />I was confused, and we took some time off. You went your way, and I went to oatmeal, then the flashy Kashi, and then many other cereals. They were ok relationships, but nothing like the relationship I had with you. Kashi was too sweet, too full of frills and she left me craving for more. Kashi was also a gold digger, and demanded so much of my money. Oatmeal got too messy and time consuming in the mornings... I was forlorn.<br /><br />Years later, while studying for an exam, my friend introduced me to you again. I couldn't have been happier.<br /><br />After years of searching for the perfect cereal, I knew it was you, it could only be you. We belong together, you are so delicious without being cloyingly sweet like other cereals, you're good FOR me and, you don't take much of my time and money.<br /><br />Will you take me back, Cheerios?

review/text: I always have a big box Cheerios Cereal on hand.  I mix it with almost all my other morning cereal to make them less sweet and more pleasant to my taste.  Cheerios adds a bit crunch, without overpowering the taste of the cereal I am adding to.  Because it has 1 gram of sugar it always makes the total mixture of two cereals less sweet.  This allows me to have a variety of morning cereals that otherwise would taste too sweet to me so I would not be able to enjoy them.<br /><br />Nutrion facts for 1 cup (28 grams)<br /><br />Calories: 100 (15 from fat)<br />Total Fat 2 g<br />Cholesterol 0 mg<br />Sodium 160 mg<br />Potassim 170 mg<br />Total Carbohydrate 20g<br />Sugars 1g<br />Protein 3g<br /><br />A small fun factoid is that Cheerios was the first oat-based ready-to-eat cold cereal (introduced on May 1, 1941 by General Mills).<br /><br />If you never tried cereal mixing I recommend you give a try! It improves the taste of the sweeter cereals and it has health benefits of reducing sugar and calories while giving you a variety of tastes.

review/text: Delicious and nutritional, this cereal is one of the best! It is easy to eat, portable, and makes a great anytime meal or snack. Cheerios makes the perfect snack to take while traveling or to the office. This cereal is a children's favorite and I feel good feeding it to them because Cheerios has vitamins and minerals.

review/text: Cheerios are my most favorite cereal since I was a child.  I grew up on them. We didn't need all the sugar, now when I want sweet cereal I buy the honey cheerios and mix them.  Out of the box is a good option for a nice snack.  You cannot go wrong with Cheerios, look how long they have been on the market.

We have been ordering the multi-packs of these from Amazon for some time now and they have always arrive very fast, have always been super fresh with great dates on them, and no damage or settling. I love not having to worry about running out of these, and the price is great.

review/summary: Another Happy Cheerios Eater
review/text: I got these for just under ten bucks, which made them about $2.50 a box.  Combined with other purchases, I got the free shipping so it was a decent deal.  Naturally, no sooner than they had arrived, my local store was selling them for even LESS than that, but still, the convenience of having these sent to my door just couldn't be beat.  According to the box, there are 14 servings (at one cup apiece).  I figure there are probably closer to 10 servings the way I pour so they averaged 25 cents a bowl for this purchase.  Not too shabby!  And -- very importantly, the expiration date on the boxes is April 2013.

review/text: I love these. I also don't mind if my breakfast tastes like grains and not desert. If you want sweetness just add strawberries or some banana slices to the bowl and you don't sacrifice the healthiness of the cereal. If you must have sweet you can always upgrade to honey nut cheerios. Keep in mind this is still made with processed grains, so it isn't super healthy but is still a likely upgrade over whatever you eating habits are now.

review/text: CLASSIC, ORIGINAL "CHEERIOS" CEREAL has been around for a long time.  It has truly earned a place as one of the best cereals around, and appears near the top of the recommended cereals in the<br />"EAT THIS, NOT THAT -- Best and Worst Foods In America", by David Zinczenco and Matt Goulding.  Classic, original "Cheerios" is VERY tasty, has many vitamins and minerals, much nutrition, and has relatively few artificial ingredients.  It's good for any human, of any age.  And any human, of any age, (or at least the great majority of humans...and who knows, maybe ETs, too!), will find it quite delicious and good for their health!<br /><br />Like any cereal, however -- no matter how tasty and/or nutritious -- Classic, Original "Cheerios" DOES get a bit boring if you have it for breakfast EVERY day for seveal weeks.  So -- put a little sugar and/or cinnamon, or other topping on it, etc.  Use your imagination!<br />But the great thing about Classic, Original "Cheeerios" is, even if you get bored with it, and, instead of using different toppings, you switch to a different cereal for a week or two, when you DO come back to eating original, classic Cheerios, it will be as tasty and yummy s ever!<br /><br />The only thing I DON'T like about classic, regular "Cheerios" cereal is that, if you have it alone, as a snack, and not as a breakfast cereal, surrounded by milk, you DO take a chance of having some of these delectable, "O"-shaped little morsels fall on the floor.  I guess this can be said of any breakfast cereal used as a snack -- but I can't help wishing that classic "Cheerios" also came in a larger, snacking size, so that this wouldn't happen as much.  Guess I like snacking on Cheerios!  I think many other people do too!

To minimize expenses, I try to eat one pint every two days, and, sometimes, I can eat a half-pint per day. Usually, though, I can't stop once I start. I was on the CHOCOLATE wagon for several years. Now, with ARCTIC ZERO, I'm definitely off the wagon.  Today's my off-day, and I'm sweating it (just kidding).

I thought that it would be a white/mint ice-cream with chocolate cookies, but it's a CHOCOATE ice-cream with mint flavoring. There are no cookies involved.  So, as long as you know what you're getting, it's still very good.  Personally, I'd like it if they came out with a traditional "mint-chip" flavor though.

They really are super nice and it's a small company.  You got to appreciate businesses like that!  They do everything themselves which really allows for top notch shipping and customer service!  Anyway, this flavor is the best if you like chocolaty mint, like a thin mint cookie or a peppermint paddy, or even chocolate chip mint ice cream, or perhaps(I've never had one) a Junior Mint, because, if I go through those old Seinfeld quotes I've got indexed in my memory, I believe it was Kramer who said "Who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint-- it's *delicious*!"

review/text: I was so excited to finally find this in a store near me.  I ran in, paid my $6.99 for a pint and dug in with a spoon while sitting in the car.  All I can say is I was seriously disappointed.  This is chocolate flavored water ice.  The chocolate flavor isn't enough to satisfy any type of chocolate craving.  Even at 32 calories a serving I thought it was a waste of the calories. I had a few bites then put it down to try and let it melt to get a little more flavor. It wasn't any better.  I pitched this in the garbage, having probably eaten only a dollar of my seven dollars.  Here is what I learned from this experience: if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is. Don't waste your time or your money.

review/text: This stuff is simply amazing.  At first bite, it seems a bit bland, but after eating a little bit I forgot it wasn't regular ice cream.  If you try to eat it without letting it melt a little, it's rock hard and the texture is almost reminiscent of gelatin,but after a little melting it's just like any ice cream.  I really like this flavor, but putting the word cookie in it is a bit misleading.  It's mint chocolate flavored all the way through with no "cookie" bits in it at all.<br /><br /> Great product!  I would recommend looking for it in stores before ordering online though, as it gets pretty expensive.

review/summary: Used to be GREAT stuff... what happened?
review/text: I first purchased this product a few years ago (in a local shop, not on Amazon). I remember it being delicious--creamy with a nice chocolate mint flavor. It became a regular item on my grocery list.<br /><br />However, a few months after I first discovered Arctic Zero, I picked up a pint from the same store and I noticed that the product tasted watered-down, freezer burnt, and devoid of flavor. I had initially thought I'd just chosen a pint from a bad batch or that it had been stored improperly, but after purchasing different flavors from different stores, I can only assume that something has changed with the way the product is made. Every flavor now tastes like frozen water and it no longer has the creamy consistency it used to.<br /><br />I recently saw the mint flavor once again at another store after moving out of state. Considering it had been months since I stopped buying Arctic Zero, I thought I'd give it one last shot. Needless to say, I was met with the same disappointment as with my previous purchases. I will no longer be wasting money on this product. You'd be better off with low-fat frozen yogurt if you're looking for a healthier alternative to ice cream.

review/summary: This is an incredible substitute!
review/text: I found Arctic Zero Mint at Sunflower Market by accident and decided to try it. I was a little disappointed at first because it didn't have the texture of ice cream and was too hard to dish it out of the container. I decided to try it a few more times before giving up...  as real ice cream had packed on the pounds. One day I left a container out on the counter for about 15 minutes before opening it and surprise, surprise.... the texture was incredible! All it needed to do was melt a little bit. It was like eating the real thing plus the flavor were enhanced.  I give this flavor a 10+. I am eager to try the pumpkin and will probably order it in the near future. I've tried the other flavors but found this one to be the best. Although they all are good for some variety. It is pricey so you need to know that up front. But for me... as long as I can get them without going broke I will. I used to spend so much more money on binge foods so this is really not that bad. I do try to not eat a pint everyday but once I open one it's hard to stop. It satisfies craving for something cold and sweet. Plus...  it's zero in fat, 8 grams of fiber, over 12 grams of protein, and 150 calories for the entire pint. It's like having a frozen protein shake that actually has the texture of ice cream! Now that is terrific. I just found out that they make ice cream bars. I can't wait to try them all!

review/summary: I love this flavor!
review/text: This is a great flavor of Arctic Zero! I always love chocolate and mint together. My husband thinks it is great too and he is picky. I like to scoop it into a small bowl, put a light whipped topping on it, and chocolate whey crisps. It tastes decadent  and goes farther. They whey crisps add protein and crunch.

review/summary: Good but don't expect chocolatey flavor
review/text: My taste buds were a little bored with the flat flavor so I took 1/2 cup of Arctic Zero (75cal) + 2 TB Light Hershey's Chocolate Syrup (35cal) + 1TB Sprinkles (25cal). Not bad for 135 calories. HOWEVER for 15 more calories I could eat a Chocolate Skinny Cow Ice Cream Cone with Fudge. Truly, Arctic Zero is something you have to try if you are like me and like to taste anything new on the market. Unfortunately the novelty for my husband and I wore off after the first pint.

review/summary: Adequate
review/text: For nearly a year now I'd been reading rave reviews of this product on the interwebs.  I'd check my local groceries stores, search online to see where the nearest place to try some was.  So when it popped up on Amazon, I grabbed some -- despite the significant price.<br /><br />And it's okay.  If you're dieting, it beats the bejesus out of celery.  As a low-calorie treat, I'd put it on par with yogurt -- AND by volume, lower calorie than even yogurt.  So after the hype I was a little let down, but it's not terrible.  It's just not a magical low calories replacement for ice cream.

review/summary: Tasty Lil Spoonfuls of Heaven!!!!
review/text: I REALLY LOVE THIS STUFF!!!! Such a sweet, creamy indulgence that I can enjoy without guilt!<br />My favorite was the Chocolate Peanut Butter until the Chocolate Mint Cookie became available!!<br />Chocolate Mint Cookie is YUMMMMY!!!! I like to mix it with blueberries or some plain nonfat greek yogurt and sprinkle some ginger on top! YUM!!!<br /><br />Arctic Zone doesn't increase my desire for more sweets like some frozen desserts can! I like that I can indulge almost daily and not worry about weight gain!!<br /><br />Its also perfect for those times you want a lil something sweet throughout the day, even a spoonful goes a looong way for my tastebuds!!<br /><br />I love that there's 4 grams of protein in each serving and that it has 2 grams of fiber! I've never heard of a frozen dessert with fiber?! Way to go Arctic Zone peeps!!<br /><br />I can't eat an entire pint in one sitting, but sometimes can in a day, but, thats only if Im home all day...lol... a little goes a long way and I love that! When I used to get frozen yogurt with Splenda (can't believe I used to do that) in it (low-carb fro yo), whenever I had some, I always wanted more. With Artic Zone, I am satiated with just a serving or two.<br /><br />I am sooo grateful they came out with this! I would love a coconut flavor if possible??? or Banana cream pie??? Price is cheaper than indulging in fro-yo each day and much more friendly to your curves!!! :) I plan to take a few pints to the family's Thanksgiving Feast for family to try.

review/text: Dear Artic Zero,<br /><br />I was so excited when I saw you at a health market today. Bought you even though it was pretty expensive....<br /><br />I couldn't wait to try it so then I had it outside of the market and right then I wanted to go back in to return it. But I didn't want to do something like that.<br /><br />So I gave it another try and took another bite, hoping that it would change my mind. Nope.<br />I gave it another try hoping that it was something that would grow on me and once again, NOPE.<br /><br />After a couple of minutes the side started to melt a bit and I gave that part a try, hoping it might taste better. Well, guess I got too hopeful cause it didn't.<br /><br />So what did it taste like? Diluted something. I could not taste the chocolate nor could I taste the mint. At first it tasted like nothing/diluted something. Then after a few bites of it tasted unpleasant, I was tempted to just toss it out.<br /><br />-Unsatisfied Customer

review/text: I was recently suffering from painful diverticulitus. I saw this aloe vera drink at a 7-11 store and thought I'd give it a try. I was shocked at my first sip when I felt the chunks of fruit in my mouth. They are virtually invisible in the bottle unless you really look for them. Once I got past the shock, I was pleasantly surprised by the mild, sweet flavor. Most other aloe vera drink brands that I have tried are pretty nasty tasting, but I actually enjoyed the taste of this product, and it did a good job soothing my stomach.

review/summary: Fresh product from a trusted brand, and the price is right.
review/text: In general I have always found NOW foods to be a company that takes quality seriously.  I have bought flax seed from other sources before, only to find it rancid when I opened the bag.  This product was fresh as can be, and has stored well for me since I bought it a few months ago.  Not only does NOW sell a fresh product, but Amazon must store it properly or have a very high turnover rate, because the product I received was very fresh.  Storage makes a difference with flax.<br /><br />The price for 6 bags was lower than I've seen elsewhere.  I store one open bag at a time in my refrigerator and keep the rest in the freezer.  They have kept well for me.<br /><br />I use milled flax seed to make a variety of foods, mostly homemade granola and low-carbohydrate, high-fiber baked goods.  It serves as a good flour replacer in some recipes.

review/summary: Notes from a first timer
review/text: I'm a left-coaster and we don't see Tastykake products, nor being a near vegan do I indulge normally.  Anyway, the appearance of the product was too compelling and I splurged on an order of these.<br /><br />The picture here, for those fellow un-initiates, is misleading.  It is not like a Hostess pie or a turnover, it's an actual little pie in it's own tiny aluminum pie pan!  The crust is a bit salty, and naturally is not crisp or flaky after being in contact with the filling in a small box all that time, but it is very tasty.  The filling is also not overflowing the casing, like the picture, at best it at least fills the lower crust, but sometimes not.<br /><br />That's just so you have the proper expectations, not meant as a criticism really, because this nasty little devil is great, really excellent.  Miles and miles above the Hostess pies (although it's been twenty years since I tried one), really no comparison at all.  If you're in the mood for something special, check it out.  Shipping was super fast, despite the conservative Azon estimates, so gratification in the near term is guaranteed.<br /><br />If someone franchised this product and got it into supermarkets with the neat little boxes in a rack near the checkout line (to compete with candy bars), they'd sell MILLIONS of these puppies.

review/summary: Think Slim Jim is vile? Try this.
review/text: I am not a beef-stick fan. Maybe this is a cultural thing, but I think they taste ghastly, dry, vinegary, sawdusty and salty. This was juicy, moist, with just a bit of snap for texture with a really tangy flavor thing going on. It is not the hot sauce kind of acrid vinegary spicy like so many beef-sticks tend to be.  I'd describe the flavor as more a robust, full flavored "zest" with dominant elements of garlic and black pepper. I consider it more flavorful than spicy, but your mileage may vary.<br /><br />It is about the size of the Ostrim stick (*gag* hate Ostrim).  Each stick is about 93 calories with 8gm of protein, 240mg of sodium (not the best but it is a beef-stick), 5 g of fat, and 4g of carbs. But this is not just the best tasting beef-stick I have ever had, it is the *only* beef-stick I would conceivably classify as tasty.  I am not the only one who thinks so because if I buy a case with the intention of storing it as an emergency snack, even if I wait a day, my friends and family would have finished off everything. Find a good hiding spot.<br /><br />This is also a...er...pungent smelling snack, so don't whip it out during a date or anything.

There is almost no chicken in it, and the tuna is very dark brown for some reason.<br /><br />After a few days on this food we noticed the cats started vomiting every day. I also noticed that they started shedding considerably more than normal. I believe the excess shedding was causing them hairballs, which was then causing them to vomit.<br /><br />After a few weeks we decided to switch back to the Weruva brand just to see if there was a difference. Within days they stopped vomiting and were barely shedding.<br /><br />I can't say with certainty that this food was causing the problem, but I believe it might have. Would not recommend.

review/summary: So far she loves it
review/text: Our cat tends to really like variety, so whenever I try a new brand of food she really loves it but then the newness wears off and it is just ok. This particular tuna and chicken really gets her excited still and it has been a couple of weeks. Time will tell, but so far it has been her enthusiastic favorite.<br /><br />Oddly, our cat doesn't seem to like fish all that much and prefers poultry centered products. I took a chance with this mixture and it worked. Anyone know the difference between this tuna and chicken 4Eva and the tuna and chicken chuckles from the same company?

review/summary: Cat surprisingly loves it
review/text: I read a review of this product in another size (the 3oz) which said her FancyFeast-addicted cats liked this food. My cat has snubbed EVERY healthy canned cat food that I've tried. I didn't believe the review I read, but I figured I'd try this particular flavor.<br />My pickypicky princess of a cat LOVES IT. What's also nice about this particular food is that it comes in shredded strips and large ~1cm round chunks with a thick non-gelatinous gravy.<br />I was worried my cat would eat it too quickly and puke it, which she does with chunky FancyFeast, but it has yet to happen with this food.<br />I'm very excited about this brand. It's not even that expensive. I can't really afford more than 54c/can of FancyFeast (Wal-Mart price) but I was able to get this brand for almost the same price per ounce as FF. Very happy about that and pleased with Amazon.

review/summary: hard to open
review/text: Irregardless of the food, the cans are just hard to open and I almost cut myself trying. The lids are too thick. As for the food, it seemed watery and my cats were not too impressed.

review/summary: Makes my Cat Sick =-(
review/text: Ever since Lulu stopped eating Wellness Core Chicken formula (even when I thoroughly mixed it in with her favorite foods she picks around it and leaves it in her dish), I have been searching for a wet grain-free protein staple for her diet.<br /><br />I bought one can of this to try.  She LOVED it and ate it right up.  But then, later that night, she vomited...<br /><br />It was clear so I thought maybe it was unrelated, so I fed a little bit to her again in the morning.  She threw up almost immediately after eating it =-(  I know it is slightly higher in protein than her other foods, but I thought since she was already acclimated to other Wellness foods and high-protein options that she'd be fine.  Sadly I was wrong.  I won't be trying to feed her this food anymore.<br /><br />I didn't give this food one star because I still believe this might be a high-quality food, even if it didn't agree with my cat's stomach.  There's also a chance I might be wrong about what's causing her to vomit: if that ends up being the case after speaking with the vet, I'll be sure to update this review.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/18: My cat was suffering from acid reflux post-surgery, like some humans do.  I will still not be purchasing this food because it was just too rich for her and caused each flare up.  She thought it was delicious, though, so it may be awesome for a different cat.

review/summary: Questionable country of origin...
review/text: Ok, so product description on purchase page specifically states this product is made in, (pardon me, created in) the USA.  Pretty tricky wording.  Del Monte is company that is also producing other MILO products (eg, chicken jerky and grilled chicken) that don't say either way.  Well, I ordered three products, this and other two chicken.  Immediately noticed that the Chicken Jerky and Grilled Chicken were in package printed "MADE IN CHINA" ?!! I have chosen to not feed my dog anything Made In China, since all the problems with pet foods using products from there.  I am a bit concerned that some are and some claim to not be.  Not sure I understand Del Monte option to put out a product line that any of the line is made in china and then advertise that the product are created in USA.  Very confusing and now I don't trust the packaging that states USA.  Hmmm, a real shame as the dogs LOVE these brand treats... but not going to use any longer as concern for their health.

review/summary: Tasty Healthy Treats Made in the USA
review/text: My goal is to find healthy treats maade in the USA.  I've learned from experience with our dog (14 years) in the treat department to NO LONGER buy treats or food made in China or other countries due to increased risk of disease; in our dog's case, kidney issues.  Go to dogaware.com (dog experts with credentials) for information about the dangers of giving your pet treats made in China.<br /><br />Our Bichon loves these treats.  We break them up into smaller pieces and he really enjoys them which is great because he's so picky.  Especially appreciate that there are no artificial flavors, colors or fillers.

review/summary: Amazing variety, great deal
review/text: Not only is this particular configuration a great deal (versus the 5 or 10 flavor options), the product was well-packaged and arrived very quickly.  The flavoring oils are quite strong and smell/taste wonderful. For some of them, I need only one drop to flavor my entire 12oz smoothie, other flavors need a few drops, but it's still phenomenal to have such a palette at my command. I'm looking forward to mixing banana cream with a tiny bit of black walnut for a "banana bread" protein smoothie.  I also bought flavors to play with my soda stream carbonator; zero calorie sarsaparilla will be mine!<br /><br />While plenty of candy recipes call for using the entire contents of these little bottles, I'm using them for single drop applications (drinks, mostly), so portion control is a little trickier.  I opted to get tiny plastic droppers, like these: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0084XWJYK">Cosmos � 0.2 ml Plastic Transfer Pipette, Pack of 100 + Cosmos Cable Tie</a> so not only am I able to perfectly control how much flavoring I'm using, I also get to feel like a mad scientist in my kitchen.

review/summary: Exactly as Pictured
review/text: Received my order (24 dram-size bottles) today and was very satisfied.  They are just as described.  Original LorAnn bottles and sealed (not re-bottled or re-labeled). I was happy none of them broke or leaked also. I did get one wrong flavoring but oh well that's no big deal;  I would order these again.  I ordered the cotton candy in the one ounce size also and it was great too. LorAnn flavorings are a very concentrated oil-based flavoring unlike the ones you normally find which are alcohol or water based. I hope these continue to be available here on Amazon because I will be ordering again for sure if so.  I wanted these mainly for the purpose of DIY e-liquid (e-cigarette liquid) but these would be a great addition to anyone's kitchen just to have on hand;  and the little bottles are cute!  I will be telling lots of people about these and where to get them (I have lots of vaping buddies lol) It isn't easy to find good flavoring products out there that someone hasn't repackaged/re-bottled and relabeled.  Its All Sweet!!!
