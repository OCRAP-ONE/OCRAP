review/summary: Finally!
review/text: My wife is a coffee snob ( she calls herself that too) and we have browsed Amazon for K cups for  a couple years, We must have purchased every dark French Roast there is. All the coffee was good but just was not "it" until we ordered this coffee. Finally a coffee dark, bold enough yet smooth and not bitter. She even runs it thru the machine twice and still gets a good cup of coffee. May cost a little more than others we have purchased but well worth it. Now when re-ordering I can just go to my last coffe order and re-order same. Simple, quick and satisfing. Plus it has a cool picture of the Eifle Tower on the box.

review/text: I was so disappointed in this coffee. I guess I was fooled by the "Oooh it's more expensive than the others, there must be something special to it! I have to try it once!"I never get taken in by price!! There was absolutely nothing to it that was any better than other K cups from other brands that sell Colombian coffee. Don't waste your money on it, not worth it...

review/text: This was just not my cup of tea - er, I mean coffee (har har). It had a sharp, acrid taste to it, and left a bitter aftertaste. I'm not a coffee connosisseur by any means, but I know what I like and I know what I don't like, and I don't like this. I would not recommend it, especially with so many other Keurig coffee options.

review/summary: Advertised as Medium-Bold, but more Medium than Bold.  Slightly Bitter, but Not Harsh.
review/text: This Columbia Blend leans more to the medium side than the bold side of coffee.  However, there is a slight kick to it, so solid medium coffee drinkers may want to take a pass.<br /><br />The blend is also slightly bitter, but not so bitter that it would be considered a harsh taste.  The bitter can be toned down by milk, which would leave no significant aftertaste.<br /><br />I would put this kcup in the same category as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>, although I would choose this Barista Prima Columbia blend over the Caribou Blend.<br /><br />This is an OK blend, but there are better coffee blends on the market.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this kcup in a free sample pack mailed by Keurig to its customers.

review/text: Got this k-cup in a selection that came with my new Keurig. I usually make the small, 6 oz. cup. The resulting brew was so bitter and acrid that is was undrinkable... not just bad. Thinking that I must have done something wrong I tried again.....this time making a 12 ouncer......absolutely no difference. It tasted distinctly burnt!

review/text: If you're one of those folks who craves chocolate bars with some protein as a snack or dessert or on-the-go emergency mini-meal, and you need no gluten, and you want it to taste nice, and you don't want a lot of sugars, and you do not mind soy (this has both soy and whey isolates), this is a nice option.<br /><br />I can't have a lot of soy. But sometimes, ah, well, I will give in--for some grilled tofu or some tofu red curry or nice miso soup. Well, the other day, I was at Whole Foods, looking for gluten free bar options for my purse (emergency snack ration options), and decided to give it a go, despite the soy. And whoa, liking it.<br /><br />If you just care about taste--this tastes good.<br /><br />If you're a crunch fiend--let's say that you like chocolate crunch candies or bars--this fits the bill.<br /><br />I have used Larabars, Quest bars, Kind bars, and Paleobars, and now I can add this to the arsenal of "What can I dump in my purse when I'm out on a day of errands to stem temptations for utter crap when I'm hungry."<br /><br />Wish it was just whey in there, but at least the soy is non-GMO. :D<br /><br />Vegan, gluten-free, kosher, dairy-free, low sugar, moderate-carb, high fiber, with protein and real dark chocolate.... and tasty.

review/summary: The perfect protein bar!
review/text: I've searched long and hard and tried dozens of protein bars. Some taste bad, some have tons of fat, some have tons of sugar, some have the even worse sugar substitutes (and claim they are low carb!).<br /><br />Enough is enough!<br /><br />Here is the answer, here is what you need. These are protein packed, low sugar, gluten free, delicious bars that - after one taste, has me convinced I've found the only bar that I'm going to eat so long as the rest of the market is saturated with faux-health bars.

review/summary: Our new favorite protein bar
review/text: We love dark chocolate, so this bar tastes great to us. It's low calorie, only 2g of sugar, 15g of protein and 9g of fiber and it's gluten free! It kind of reminds me of the Hershey Krackel candy (only in dark chocolate). My 9 year old loves these. It makes a great snack. She likes it even more then the other Nugo Dark Chocolate crunch gluten free protein bars.<br />I'm not a big fan of many protein bars with crisped rice or many different nuts. This one tastes like a candy bar, only I don't feel bad eating it, since it's only 2g of sugar, lower fat, loaded with protein and it's dark chocolate.<br />Raspberry flavor is good too, if you like raspberry with dark chocolate.

review/text: Most low-carb/high-protein snacks and sweets are full of chemicals - these bars are the opposite! OK, perhaps they don't taste like "real chocolate" but they are tasty enough, satisfy sweet-tooth cravings, and thanks to the protein+fibre content, actually make you feel quite full! In my opinion, they are great! And unlike most low-carb sweets, they are actually good for you and made with simple ingredients - NO artificial sweeteners and NO sugar alcohols!!!

review/text: Definitely not a favorite of mine. They were dry and flavorless in my opinion. It does have that "crispy" texture but fails to deliver in the taste department. I guess some might appreciate these if you aren't into "sweet" chocolate. They aren't sweet but they are rich... so consider yourself warned. The taste is almost like the fake sugary sweet-n-low sort of taste but not overwhelming - just fake. Either way, not what I prefer and I'll try another bar.

review/text: I am a big fan of NUGO dark chocolate bars. These have more protein then the others but I think there is chocolate overload in these and it is tough for me to say that because I love dark chocolate. I probably will stick with the other NUGO dark chocolate bars. I gave these a 4 because of the overload but if you really really really like dark chocolate these are for you. Also what is good about these is that they provide the protein without the high sugar content of other bars on the market. I may buy these again after eating a few more of them but I was surprised with the first one at the strong chocolate that make up these bars. Usually I have cup of coffee after eating a NUGO bar. Maybe with these a cup while I eat them would make more sense.

review/summary: Great low sodium soup
review/text: If you are used to commercial soups, you will find this VERY bland because it has no salt. If you are on a low sodium diet, however, this soup is perfect esp. for a cold winter day. The mushrooms impart a mild earthy flavor and the barley is decently toothsome considering it's canned. Enjoyed this with a sprinkling of Mrs. D-- and it was actually the base for a delicious light supper. This variety has a great comfort food appeal that makes it a good choice for those late evenings when you want something warm and filling, but easy on your stomach.

review/summary: An easy winner
review/text: This is an easy to make meal that is different from your garden variety meal-in-a-box.  I tend to use smoked sausage with the mix.  The sausage is precooked so it soaks up flavor from the mix as the whole thing simmers.<br /><br />When I had more time, I tried mixing smoked sausage and grilled chicken.  The chicken was marinated with an off-the-shelf louisiana cajun style marinade and then grilled.  Slice and put the chicken in at the end when the rest is done (or the chicken will dry out being "cooked" a second time) and it was fantastic.  Since the point of this meal is to be quick, I only did this method once, but it was great.<br /><br />Only downside is that the meal is a bit oily, and leaves a residue at the bottom of your dish.  This just reminds you that this dish is better served as a guilty pleasure than an everyday meal.

review/text: In our house, we're big fans of Cajun fare. However, I don't often have the time to spend making homemade gumbo or jambalaya. Zatarain's mixes are pretty darned good everyday substitutes.<br /><br />When we make this jambalaya at home (at least once a week), we add chicken, as well as some fresh andouille sausage that our local grocery makes. I often have people beg me for the recipe, then have to tell them that it was a mix. Not only is this a great-tasting, hearty meal, it couldn't be easier to prepare; and it only takes about 30 minutes! And with the $10 discount that Amazon is offering right now, the price on this 12-pack can't be beat.

review/text: The ONLY reason I give ZATARAIN'S NEW ORLEANS STYLE JAMBALAYA MIX, 8-OUNCE BOXES, (PACK OF 12), four stars instead of 5 is because one must buy 12 boxes together, here on Amazon.  It's scrumptious rice, but I must agree with another reviewer who said his family got tired of it after "only" 3 boxes, and the rest is now sitting on the shelf. Too much of anything -- even something as delicious as this rice -- does get tiring after a while.  Of oourse there are all kinds of customers who buy from Amazon -- some people are lucky enough to have friends, family or neighbours to share the large quantities, and prices, that Amazon puts into it's quantity packages.<br />But others, like myself, have only two -- or only one-- person for whom to buy food.  Thus, I think that BOTH large quantity packaging, (12), and small quantity packaging, (4?), should be made available.<br /><br />As for the product itself, it is truly superb!  It has just the right amount of spice, and just the right kind of spice.  It will not burn your taste-buds as some overly-spicy rice does...nor will it bore your taste-buds, as too-plain rice does.  To quote Goldilocks: "This one is JUST right!"<br /><br />Totally yummy!  But I don't want to have to eat quite so much!

review/summary: Effortless Meal / Adds Flavor to Vegetarian Diet
review/text: I've enjoyed eating <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E3ZFBC">Zatarain's New Orleans Style Jambalaya Mix</a> for a few years now. I'm a vegetarian, so like anyone with a restricted diet, I found myself getting into a rut with my meals. I gave this a try, because I was looking to add some variety to my meals. It is wonderful.<br /><br />MY FAVORITE MEAL<br />First, I fix the rice. That only takes about 25 minutes and is nothing more complicated than boiling water. Then, in a separate pan I cook some kind of vegetarian sausage (I used to use boca sausage, but that seems to have been discontinued). I usually season it with pepper, a bit of soy sauce, and garlic. I prefer to wait for them to get crispy on the verge of burnt. That seems to help them keep their flavor. After that, I put some green peppers, onions, and spinach in with the sausage. Finally, I put it all into the pot with the rice. I cook the vegetables/sausage separately from the rice because I want them to retain their flavor. It gives the jambalaya a more complicated taste.<br /><br />Make space for this in your pantry. One box serves six (not counting whatever meat/vegetables you add), so for an individual you'll have 72 meals with this! If you only fix this meal once or twice a week, you are looking at about a year's worth of jambalaya. It's a great value :)

I emptied the back in a zip-loc and it was full of these little bugs crawling around. If I would of put the packaging directly in the water i'm sure the bugs would have died instantly in the water.<br /><br />I was completely disgusted and called the company. The woman on the line was completely unfazed saying it seemed that my product was contaminated and that these things happen!

This product has absolutely no resemblance in taste to that product whatsoever. It doesn't even hold a resemblance of taste to jambalaya in general. I made the mistake of buying a dozen boxes and they are all in the trash now. NEVER buy a Zatarains product again.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: This is an excellent alternative to the "real thing".  If you don't have time to prepare the ingredients from scratch, this is a great substitute. Being Creole, I am an expert on Louisiana/Cajun spices.  This mix is pretty close to the real thing. Even though the box calls for one pound of meat, I recommend using 1lb of sausage, 1lb of shrimp or crawfish tails, and 1/2lb of chicken. Laissez Les Bons Temp Rouler!!!

review/text: Cats are obligate carnivores.  They have to eat meat, and the more veterinarians learn about cats with impaired kidney function, the more into question the conventional wisdom that such cats should avoid protein is called.  This product is mostly corn and by-products.  My vet advised me to mix this half and half with Hills Prescription w/d dry and then mush it up with canned Hills k/d or Purina DM to get something that my feral queen (1) will eat and (2) can keep down.

review/summary: Major Disappointment
review/text: I've been a "connoisseur" of dark-chocolate-dipped apricots for years and this is the first time I've ordered them from Amazon.<br /><br />This brand, Old Naples, was a real disappointment.<br /><br />The apricots have an artificial flavor, a strong aftertaste, and a stale, jelly-like texture.  It was not at all the melt-in-your mouth, sticky-sweetness that I have experienced from other brands.<br /><br />The chocolate layer is thin but more importantly, it's cheap chocolate. It's a waxy, flavorless, too-sweet chocolate that barely even looks like dark rather than milk chocolate.<br /><br />On the positive side, each one was individually sealed in cellophane so they weren't as messy as I expected, and the simple gold box was attractive.<br /><br />I would not order these again.

review/text: These are sweet, delicious, addictive and quite expensive at approximately $5 per piece.<br />The apricot flavor is explosive and natural tasting to me.<br />I disagree with the reviewer who said they are "artificial flavor, a strong aftertaste, and a stale, jelly-like texture." The chocolate is dark chocolate, not milk chocolate, and it does appear to have a higher cocoa butter content to make it more firm on the moist apricot, but I would not describe it as "waxy".<br />I highly recommend these as an occasional indulgence.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of this drink. It actually "taste" good and it is refreshing. After drinking one sixteen ounce bottle I saw the same results that I saw when I mixed the honey and apple cider vinegar with distilled water myself. However, my mixture did not taste anywhere as delicious as this drink did. The only drawback is I believe that the seller are asking too high a price for the convenience of having this drink already prepared for you. It is much more economical feasible to buy the vinegar, honey and distilled water and mixed it yourself. I purchased four bottles but will not reorder as it is too expensive.

So if you do like Salt & Vinegar potato chips or Vinegar then don't buy this. Save the bottles and then when you make your own you'll have something to put it in.

review/summary: Surprisingly light taste for a dark roast
review/text: I was looking forward to trying this since I've heard good things about Raven's Brew. It was offered on the Amazon Warehouse for a steep discount, so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />Very surprising taste. It's a dark roast, and I was expecting a heavy taste. Instead, it's quite light. Good, but if you're looking for a deep, rich flavor this will disappoint. Personally, I'm partial to medium roasts that have a fairly deep taste but avoid the burnt undertones often found in a dark roast. Even so, this was a bit too light for me. I'll certainly drink what I have, but I don't think I'll be ordering it again.<br /><br />I enjoyed it more when mixed with some dark roast Columbian from Coffee Bean Direct. It made for a nice blend.  On it's own, I got the best results brewing it as a pour over. It came out somewhat sour tasting when done in a French Press.<br /><br />I did get a chuckle from the description provided by Raven's Brew for this, especially the following: "Toffee like flavors form a base to definite higher notes of tangerine and lemon flower just on the edge of jasmine."<br /><br />OK, I get the toffee-like flavor part. Maybe - just maybe, I can see the tangerine and lemon being apt since there is a bit of a lemon-ish quality to this. But "just on the edge of jasmine"? Come on now!<br /><br />Their fanciful language aside, I'll give it four stars with a big caveat: Be sure that a light taste is what you're looking for. If not, give this a pass.

review/text: Based on previous reviews and the fact that it seems to use less plastic in the k-cup packaging, I tried this coffee.  In general I prefer a fairly bold coffee and I am very impressed with the flavor of this coffee.  I prefer it to the Donut Shop coffee and find it comparable with the Starbucks coffees I have tried.  The pods work terrific in my Keurig.  There have been no leaks, explosions, etc.  Although I still feel guilty for the waste I'm creating with all of these individual pods I'm throwing in the trash, I don't feel as guilty as I did with the full plastic pods from other manufacturers.  I actually just went in and subscribed to a monthly shipment.  You can't beat the price for the quality and convenience.

review/text: We have been buying kcups for over a year now, trying different brands to narrow down our likes/dislikes. Bought a small box of the Fogchaser initially, which we really liked. I read the reviews for Breakfast Blend and ordered the 80 count box. We hands down; absolutely love this particular one. The packaging is phenomenal and the coffee stays strong, fragrant and robust.<br />We just truly love the assertive, but smooth taste of this brew. Nice move to get around using all that plastic, I'm sure these can be used as mulch if you just cut the top off, which can be recycled. Win-win!!

review/summary: So good that I'm angry at myself
review/text: For four years, I've been drinking another brand's Donut-shop blend, because I thought it was good. It turns out I've been drinking substandard coffee. San Francisco Bay Coffee's Breakfast Blend is exactly what I wanted. I'm a big fan of Dunkin Donuts and other similar roasts of coffee. The breakfast blend is exactly that, but better! It's really fresh, packaged as little pouches of eight single-serve individual filters, but if you put it in a little airtight leftover container after opening the pouch, you can keep it even fresher. This makes a better cup of coffee than any other brand I've tried. If you want something bolder, go with the Fog Chaser blend, but I will stick with this one from now on.

review/text: I bought the 36 serve pack just in case I didn't like it.  BUT not only is it delicious, it is much cheaper than the traditional all plastic K-cups.  Saving money and helping the eco system, while enjoying a great cup of coffee.  a win, win, win..  I just ordered the pack of 80.  I will be a repeat customer.

Just more people switching to this coffee method for many reasons and retailers know this so they are jacking the prices. The way this product is made saves money for everyone and is designed to fit K-Cup dispensers. My Rating: 10/10<br />Please don't raise the price one people get hooked!

review/text: My first box just arrived in the mail yesterday.  I love K-cups, but don't love paying for them, and had been using a disposable filter for awhile.  I like that, but it still doesn't seem to work quite as well as the original cups.  These work amazingly well and are so much more affordable.  Not only that, but the coffee itself is great.  I will be recommending this to all my K-cup loving friends!

review/summary: Great
review/text: Initially I was not sure what to expect (due to the differences in design in contrast to K-cups), but this coffee is great! I normally do not bother to review, but it is so enjoyable that I felt obliged to. It is flavorful, but not too bold. It is crisp, but not too tangy. This breakfast blend is great for not only the morning, but anytime of the day! You can tell it is made better than other coffees available to Keurig owners. I would highly recommend to any coffee lover!

review/summary: Best K-cup Coffee you'll find
review/text: 30 years ago, I worked as a teenager for Dunkin Donuts, where I was introduced to coffee with fresh ground beans.  That smooth wonderful taste sold me for life.  I never understood the appeal of the burnt taste of Starbucks coffee.  Painful to drink.<br />In recent years, my daily routine was grinding my beans, boiling my water in an electric kettle, and brewing into a thermos.  Bit of a pain, but great tasting.  My roommate bought a K-cup coffee maker, and I tried just about every type of coffee available.  Nothing was any good. UNTIL THIS ONE.<br />This flavor is the closest to the coffee I would make every morning.  A little more expensive, but worth the cost for the convenience of having a cup in 30 seconds!<br />Smooth, not burnt, not too weak.  Just PERFECT and delicious.  Also love the fact that I'm not wasting all the plastic that other K-cups use.

review/summary: Great Buy
review/text: I couldn't pass up the low price so I ordered 2 boxes (80 per box).  When I got them, I was surprised  to see they weren't like the normal K-cups.  They are shorter and instead of the rigid plastic bottom, the coffee is encased in a rounded filter.  I was ready to return them to Amazon.  I couldn't imagine them working with my Kuerig because of the different design, but thought I'd try anyway.  I found that they actually work quite well.  The coffee is good and because of the filter, there are never any stray coffee grounds that escape the pod.  I can't say it's the best cup of coffee I have ever had, but for the price, it's darn good and always fresh!

review/text: I love this brand and prefer them to even to other kcup brands. I am not going to spend time talking about this type of kcup. However if you keep the open bags in a zip lock they will not get stale for a week or so. You get multiple packages in the box so you do not have to worry about that. These taste great however I prefer french roast and foghorn more. While these are still bold they are not as complex as the other two. Give me them  try.

review/text: This is an exceptional value for really, REALLY good coffee.  It's just what a breakfast blend should be - a bit mild, but with enough "oomph" to kickstart your morning.  Out of all of the coffees I've tried, this is hands-down my absolute favorite. I was a bit leery after trying, and not caring for, the Rainforest blend, but this is nothing at all like that blend, it's just perfectly suited for my tastes.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've moved onto Fogchaser now, which is just a tiny bit stronger, and have a new favorite. ;)

review/summary: Very good value...
review/text: I've been purchasing K-Cups from Amazon for about 6 months now since I found the pricing to be cheaper than what I can get in the stores (even if I clip coupons and look for the sales.)  I was excited to see how cheap these were per cup when I first ran across the SF brand.  I read a number of reviews and was skeptical of the "cupless" style of packaging.  I have to say that I took the chance and I am very happy with the product.  First the coffee is very good to me.  That's a matter of taste, but I think you'd have to be VERY picky about your coffee to say that this is a bad flavor in any way.  There are 10 cups in each clear bag.  8 bags in my box.  I simply cut open the bag and transfer to a ziplock.  I have no grounds in my coffee at all.  The cups are very clean - no additional mess in the machine at all.  Overall, a great product.

review/text: This caught my eye because of the price; it's at least $1-$2 cheaper than the Green Mountain/Starbucks brand for 12 cups. When I took it out of the box, I was surprised to only see a mesh basket, not the plastic cups that the other brands have. However, it worked beautifully in my Keurig and produced very good coffee. Granted, I take my coffee with cream and sugar but it tastes like well-brewed coffee. It's not bitter, or too dark. This blend has a slight nutty flavor and it's very smooth.

review/summary: UPDATED Review - Decent Brew on 12 oz setting
review/text: I am not one for coffee that is over roasted or extremely strong.  But after reading other reviews and seeing the prices, I signed on up to try both the Breakfast and Rainforest blends.  Some said they were similar to other Kcups they had used, like Donut People, and I have to disagree.  Even upon receipt I could smell the over roasted aroma, but gave it a try.  Luckily we'll have enough company to kill 160 of these things...and I will suffer through a few 12 oz brews (to get it as weak as possible) myself.<br /><br />If you like Green Mountain Kcups, stick with them...this is not what you are looking for.<br /><br />****Updated August 26, 2012****<br /><br />I always try to be fair in my reviews and while I purchased two blends from San Francisco Bay Coffee for my Keurig and am not crazy about them, I must say that my opinion of the Breakfast Blend has changed enough for me to update this rating and review.  I still do not like the Rain Forest Blend I also purchased, but decided I would force myself to drink these as I had bought such a large box of both.  What I have found is that on a 12 oz setting the Breakfast Blend is not too bad.  It took a few days to get used to, but I am now good with it.  Heck, for the price over Green Mountain K Cups, I might even buy this one again.  In the end I am getting a 12 oz cup of coffee vs 8 oz and like I said, the flavor grew on me once I had been drinking it for a few days.

review/summary: Solid Cup of Coffee!
review/text: This alternative to the traditional plastic K-Cup caught my eye immediately because of the price.  I have been buying the basic Ks from Amazon for years, always pretty much around the same price, and have been eager to see the drop in prices once Green Mountain's patent expires on the technology.  This company found a unique way of getting around the patent with these filter-exposed cups.  To our benefit, this brand sells more for less, and that to me was worth the try. I chose the Breakfast Blend because I normally drink the Coffee People Donut Shop, which I too love, and I thought this would be the closest match.  This turned out to be true, both are smooth and not too strong or robust.  Both have good flavor without being over the top.  As for the style of the cup, as all others have said, it does not have the plastic canister look, but rather just the filter, which I personally like.  Unlike the traditional cups, you get a whiff of coffee just before you put it in the machine, which is a nice tease.  I just filled up a Ziplock bag to keep them fresh and it's easy enough.  I'm also keeping the spent cups to use for fertilizer, just cut off the top, dry out the grounds and pour them around your garden.<br /><br />Overall I'd highly recommend this, the price is great and the coffee is very good.  If you are a Coffee People Donut Shop fan like me, you'll enjoy this Breakfast Blend.  If you prefer jet fuel, this will not appeal to you.

review/text: The first San Francisco Bay k cup I tried was the Fog Chaser. It wasn't bad...I loved the way these k cup type pods work in my Keurig! I have absolutely no issues with them not being standard k cups and having less plastic. Perfectly functional with less waste and a better price. So we tried the Breakfast Blend---great flavor,smooth coffee. I am a person who orders coffees from places like Coffees of Hawaii and Joe's Coffee so I am pretty picky about flavor. I am quite satisfied with this coffee as an everyday brew.For comparison? My mother is a Donut Shop and  Green Mountain k cup user and says this is very much like the Donut Shop- we both brew it on the largest or next to largest setting every time and it is a strong, solid cup- never weak. Freshness? I read concerns about the coffee staying fresh because of the filter type bottoms of the cups- have never had an issue with this.Each sealed bag has 8 cups in it and we have always used them before they had a chance to get stale! This is a loved coffee in our household! I now have this on subscribe and save and am considering changing the delivery to more often!

review/summary: Breakfast Blennd is good coffee and more earth friendly
review/text: I was initially shocked when I initially opened my parcel and found these very cool new San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Breakfast Blend, 80-Count. First this is a great value at $33.00 including free shipping with my Prime Account. For those of you who have not tried Prime membership it pays for itself in between 60-90 days with moderate use and I believe Amazon still offers a 30 day free trial which is worth looking at to experience the benefits. I've had my membership for 3 years and its a great value! Enough for the the Amazon commercial back to the coffee. Price per cup is the lowest I have found anywhere at just under 42 cents. The normal K-cups are all plastic while these have a plastic ring with a fiber filter bag. Its not 100% recyclable but its a big step forward as the filter will break down quickly and the coffee grounds will then fall out allowing those to decompose as well. That leaves a small plastic ring (which looks recyclable) and foil top left. To assist to keep your coffee fresh you receive a reusable lightweight recyclable plastic tub with an airtight lid that holds about 8 K-cups for peak freshness. In addition each 8 K-Cups is sealed in a vented recyclable bag inside the box so you open one and put them in the storage tub after. Nice touch.<br /><br />This is a lively coffee with a velvet like finish, its gives me an average caffeine buzz, please note I am not big coffee drinker, more a 1-2 good cups a day guy and I like to have variety, thus my move to a Keurig system (which I love and have spread this to 6 others in my family as well as many at my office). This is a good coffee with nice flavor and I also like the fact its a little more recyclable and a good value. A++++

review/text: Ive enjoyed the coffee. I was a little skeptical but the coffee tastes great, the pods work great and it is a much cheaper alternative to K-cups breakfast blend or donut shop. Don't be hesitant--go ahead and buy it.  I just bought my second one!
