review/summary: great convenience beware stale vit'C
review/text: . I really like this product<br />and also the concept of powdered vegetables;<br />but in the case of tomatoes,<br />they have a lot of vitamin C,<br />and if that gets oxidized,<br /> it can cause stomach cancer;<br />so it would be nice to see<br />the vitamin C content on this package<br />to know how much did not get oxidized .<br />. next time you get a jar of pasta sauce,<br />notice that high-fat versions are bright orange<br />and they have servings with 25% RDA of vitamin C;<br />whereas, low fat versions look dark,<br />and they have servings with 10% RDA of vitamin C<br />-- the difference is in the oxidation:<br />oxidized vitamin C is not counted .

review/summary: My son loves this
review/text: My son loves this food.  He is 16 months now and I still use them.  Not all the time, but often.  The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.  He won't eat much when he's in pain, but these are easy on his gums.  They are organic and a quick meal.  My son is strong and a very healthy weight.  I make sure he gets as much organic, wholesome food as possible.  Buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money.  He loves the whole line.

review/summary: Son Loves This
review/text: I think that with most of these baby foods it is simply a matter of taste and preference. My son, now just 1, has been eating this for the past 3 months and loves it. The ingredients are healthy and organic. Regarding the issue with the bay leaf, to me that's no different then when I'm eating Italian food someplace, come across a bay leaf, and remove it. No infant is going to be eating this food on her/his own, so as the parent I would just remove the leaf. Problem solved!

review/summary: Crushed bay leave for a baby?
review/text: Nobody eats a bay leaf. It can be quite irritating for the stomach. Bay leaf is added just for flavor and then is usually removed before the food is served. So I am not sure I understand why they added so much crushed bay leaf into something that is prepared for babies. I am not buying this anymore.

review/summary: tasteless!!!
review/text: I bought this for my 11-month old daughter because I thought it would make a quick healthy and organic meal when I didn't have time to cook for her myself. I had used other plum organics products with good results so I decided to try this training meal. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the bland taste. My daughter is used to eating home-cooked meals and would not eat it no matter what I did. I believe that healthy food should also be tasty food so I did a little experimenting. I tried adding salt and pepper, but still with no luck. Now I have 11 pouches of this stuff and don't know what to do. I'm thinking of adding chicken stock with chunks of chicken but I'm afraid I'll just end up wasting the chicken. So, basically, I'm not at all satisfied with this product.

review/summary: Picture and product are not the same!
review/text: I have no problem with hearty chicken flavor, however I was searching for the regular chicken flavor with the vegetables, as shown in the picture supplied. Someone really should supply a picture that accurately reflects the product being sold. Imagine my surprise when I opened my shipment and got hearty chicken (without vegetables) instead of what I had searched for. Cup Noodles makes a fine product regardless of flavor, but I was looking for something specifically different which is not what I received. That being said, I like to shake up the monotony by adding a dash of curry powder (and maybe a little red pepper) before pouring in the water and letting it steep, plus I usually let it sit for an extra minute or two.

review/text: Thick hearty noodles that don't get soggy too fast are pleasant to chew. The soup is slightly more thick than the regular soup but not at an absurd level. One dissapointment is that I can't find any bits of corn in here despite it making an appearance on the box. Also no bits of chicken.

review/summary: Taste sorta like low salt broth
review/text: Flavor: It taste like low salt chicken broth. Though the thing is the nutrient content isnt low in salt. It has around 60% of your daily salt content.<br /><br />Portion: It depends. Some packages only are half full and some are over filled. Though to me it doesnt fill me up.<br /><br />Price: It is less expensive at stores. It is around $0.25 at the store. On amazon it is $1 each.<br /><br />Would i recomend this: No, I would recomend the shrimp flavor and chili flavor. I also recomend Nongshim that japaneese or korean brand of ramen. Thoose taste the best.

review/summary: Good product, BPA fears no longer an issue
review/text: ****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6LVS">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM395E">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>, (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.

review/text: I absolutely love Earths Best foods. They have the largest variety of organic foods at the best prices. The 'gourmet' flavors are slightly more expensive at my grocery store, so I thought I would give Amazon a try. The order was perfect. My son (8 months) absolutely loves the gourmet flavors.  I also like the consistency of these flavors. It is 'mid-range': not too watery (like Earths Best Chicken & Rice flavor) but not too thick.

review/text: I love these variety packs.  My only complaint is that you can get them cheaper at BRU (I found them for $9.99 for a 12 pack, regular price). That's the only reason I gave them 3 stars. But as far as the actual baby food goes, I don't feel like I could be buying anything better for my baby.  I make all of his fruit and vegetable baby food myself but I was a little overwhelmed at trying to do the meat ones.  I wanted to buy all organic but I live in a very small town and didn't want to mess with trying to find the closest place to get organic/hormone free/antibiotic free meat.  Not to mention the price and all the work to make it.  The ingredients in this baby food are all real, whole, organic foods.  No preservatives, nothing extra.  So easy!

review/text: So far this has been my favorite baby food to serve my 10 month old.  We do a lot of homemade baby food, but being a busy mom of 2 I also buy a lot of jars now.  Will only do organic brands, and really like Earths Best brand because of their good combos and I like that they come in a glass jar.  I really like the gourmet meals pack, my baby liked all of the ones in this pack right from the start, even though he didn't love some of the plainer vegetable or meat dinners.  So I've been willing to pay slightly more to get the gourmet meals set.  Good way to get good protein sources into babies too.

review/text: I chose this brand of baby food as I dont have enough time to prepare my own. Organic and nice it seemed. It states from 6 months and up. My son is 7 months. All of a sudden he started drinking large amounts of water which lead me to look closer at the label. There is up to 20 mg of sodium in these things!! A baby under 1 year has no kidney function and cannot eat salt! THen all of a sudden he had break outs in his face. Happened twice. I looked at what he had eaten those two times. SPINACH! A baby under one year should NOT have spinach! I am absolutely puzzled how a company producing food for babies, have no idea about the most general of knowledge concerning babies. I have taken my son off this food and am making my own and can only hope I have not damaged his little body by these two weeks of eating "Earths Best Organic"!

review/summary: Gross food
review/text: These meals are so disgusting. I made all my baby food for my first kid, but I don't have time with the second kid. So I ordered a bunch of earth's best food. I wish I'd only ordered one pack to start with! This glob has a terrible consistency and a barely edible flavor... to me. The baby eats it if I heat them a bit. But there's no accounting for a baby's taste.

review/summary: improper seal = botulism risk!
review/text: I ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it.  I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!<br /><br />These are 2nd foods but please note that they're much more watery than Gerber or Beech-Nut 2nd foods.  I think the watered texture frustrates my son and I spill it everywhere when I feed him.  He likes the flavors fine except for the Chicken Mango Risotto (hates it).

review/summary: Ortho Bug-B-Gon Max Bug Killer
review/text: I decided to buy this product despite the bad review about white residue, since I needed to keep my cucumber and pepper plants alive and growing, not make them look pretty.  I'm quite a fan of this stuff.  It seems quite effective in destroying the bugs that were decimating my pepper leaves and destroying my cucumber plants, and the bottle makes it easy to apply.  I bought shaker cans of Sevin at the same time, and they're such a pain to use, especially on taller plants.  The Ortho bottle lets you just spray the powder, which makes it so much easier to aim, get it where you want it, on the undersides of leaves, on plants growing up poles and fences, etc.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying this again.

review/summary: They changed the recipe
review/text: I LOVED this soup when I first tried it years ago. I've been looking for it recently and found it here. I bought a few cans but was very disappointed to learn they changed the recipe. The flavor is still there (well, mostly) but the wonton fillings are no longer bulbous, filled sections, they are now paper-thin fillings(no exaggeration, it's just a thin line) - the wontons aren't round any more, they're flat! The wonton filling was the best (and main) part of the soup but it's practically gone now.<br /><br />I'm hoping they go back to their old recipe and not be so stingy on the filling. The wontons aren't abundant and they're tiny, so how much could it really cost to fill them and satisfy their customers?

review/text: I have had wonton soup since i was a kid. Somehow in the past few years, the price doubled on these cans. The filling has decreased a lot so it's mostly noodle. It's still a yummy soup, with a good flavor that is similar to chicken noodle but a little different. However at the current price, it's almost not worth it.

They are very easy to bake, smell great and make nice little 'lunch box stuffers'.  I add cinnamon and an all-bran cereal to the mix (along with a little extra milk) to extend the mix and make them even more nutritious.  They're great from the oven warm with a pat of butter, with your favorite marmalade or NAKED!  Try them for the whole family, instead of cookies or pastries.  Now, if I can only get my paws on them again!  Wind In Hare

review/summary: New label, same great stuff
review/text: A favorite outing among Detroiters was a trip to Sanders and often that meant a hot fudge sundae made with their signature sauce.  It's a combination of chocolate and caramel and simply heavenly.  Although the original Sanders no longer exists, the company that purchased them knew a good thing and has continued to make this yummy topping.  For those of us who do not live in Michigan anymore it's awfully nice to be able to get this treat on Amazon.  Before I discovered that, I tried various grocery store and gourmet versions of the chocolate/caramel combination, but they are just not right.  This sauce warms beautifully in the microwave and pours over your ice cream or cream puff just as hot fudge should.  It doesn't harden but cools on the sundae to a more caramelly texture. And if you can't wait you can eat it by the spoonful right out of the jar :).  I always have great ideas for using it with a special waffle dessert or topping a cheesecake, but it never seems to last that long around here.<br /><br />I don't need to recommend it to folks from or in Michigan, but to others it can turn simple vanilla ice cream into a dessert that will leave your guests wanting to know how you created such an unusual and delicious topping--and asking for more.  Great stuff.

review/text: Chicken Soup has a great reputation.  It is supposed to calm nerves, and cure anything from the common cold, to cancer.  Or so tradition would have one think.  I dunno....  Chicken soup never did me any harm, I guess -- but I can't remember it curing anything, either.  Though not my favourite soup, I never really disliked it.  OK....<br /><br />My mother makes a clear soup.  Soak the chicken, and vegetables, under a low light, in a covered pot, for hours.  Then, take the fat off with a ladel.  Remove the chicken and vegetables, and serve on a separate platter, (so that just the right amount of chicken stock and vegetables go into each person's soup...or none at all, if desired.)<br />Not bad!<br /><br />My own way of making chicken soup is a little simpler.  Take chicken meat, (breat, dark meat from the legs, whatever you wish), and cut into small pieces, (the smaller, the better.)  Place 1/2 milk, half-water mixture in blender, and slowly add chicken pieces, and mixed vegetables and spices if you wish.  After a few minutes, you have a nicely PUREED chicken soup.  Also not bad.<br /><br />However, CAMPELL'S HEALTHY REQUEST CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP, which I bought to save refrigerator space, (chicken parts have to be refrigerated, this soup does not) -- doesn't taste good, (OR like either my mom's chicken soup, or my own).  I suppose this is because "modified food starch", (the second ingredient in this Campbell's soup), was never used by either my mother or myself in OUR<br />chicken soups.  (Has ANYONE ever added modified food starch to their home-made chicken soups, I wonder?).  Yes, there are tiny bits of chicken meat in this soup, (fourth ingredient, after chicken stock, modeified food starch, and water)...but very little of these.  Most ofthe ingredients come under the heading: Less than 2% of", but I begin to wonder if the "chicken meat" contained in the first section of ingredients, (those above 2%), may be like only 3% or so!  In the "2% or less" category are listed both "salt" and "sea salt"....making for perhaps 4% salt, in toto.  This is supposed to be a "low-sodium" soup -- but is 410 mgs of salt, (17% of Daily Value), actually a "low sodium" soup?  Pehaps, compared to the regular Campbell's soup, (listed at 840 mgs on the label), it is.  But NO-ONE I ever knew puts even 410 mgs of salt into any home-made soup.  A preservative?  Yes.  But still too much salt for my taste.  VITAMIN E is also a preservative -- and a much healthier one at that.  More expensive -- definiely yes.  But it would make the soup far more palatable to have 1/2 the salt, (205 mgs), and then adding a little Vitamin E!  All I know is that this abundance of salt adds not only somewhat of a danger to my heart, but also a slightly sour taste to this soup.  Making it taste, not only sour, but also so very, very UNLIKE the chicken soup I either my mom or I make.<br /><br />Perhaps the regular, Non-Healthy Request Chicken Soup by Campbell's is better.  I'll get one or two cans from my local supermarket and see, before I buy 24 via Amazon, (which is what I should have done, before buying this "Healthy Request" Campbell's soup.)  Truly, I like their Heathy Request Mushroom and Celery Soups, and don't find their Healthy Request Tomato Soup half-bad.  But one can't judge every Campbell's soup by the ones that one likes, it seems.  This cicken soup is just too salty and too soury for me ever to buy it again.  But it is palatable...JUST palatable. So, yes, I will force myself to finish all twenty-four 10 and 3/4 ounce cans....maybe one every three days or so.<br />Chicken soup is, after all, supposed to be good for one.  Or so they say.<br /><br />I'm sure this isn't BAD soup.  I just wish it tasted better.

review/text: I gave myself caffeine toxicity (do not attempt at home), and I found myself needing a non-caffeinated tea that I could enjoy. I remember buying a box of these at an expensive fru-fru store, and loving them, and compared to that, getting them for this price is a steal. As for the tea itself, it's still my favourite. Excellent fruity notes, with a natural sweetness that doesn't need sugar, and hazes to a pleasant purple when milk is added.

review/text: If you have Persians, you know how fussy they can be about their food.  Which is probably why they use one to advertise this food! :) Anyway, believe it on this flavor.  When you open the can, it just smells like fresh fish.  Honestly, can't say I've ever smelled a cat food that smelled like people food, but this one certainly does!  My cat goes mad for it -she just cannot get it in her mouth fast enough.  It's quite comical watching her eat it too - it is almost like she turns into a Hoover vacuum and well, it's gone in a flash!  The price here is about eighteen cents a can higher than what I pay for it but for this flavor, I would consider it!  Highly recommend!

review/text: (B0012KH0CS Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food, Cod, Sole & Shrimp)  Cotton loves this.  It draws his attention immediately, as long as I don't feed it to him too often.  I made mistakes when he was a kitten.  If he liked something, he got it later in the day and the next day, too.  I carpet-bombed him with favorites until, as this cat lover didn't know then, he got fussy and favorites wuzn't favorite any more.<br /><br />So now I don't buy his food from Amazon unless I am certain he will eat it.  This qualifies.  And the food is real; one or two fairly large shrimp per can.  I haven't yet learned to identify the cod from the sole.<br /><br />Have a great day!

review/text: I love several of the other Santa Cruz Organic sodas (Lemon/Lime & Pomegranate/Lime are awesome), but I don't care for this one at all. It has a root beer flavor, but something isn't right about it. It has lemon juice in it which seems odd to me, but I think the biggest problem is the low amount of carbonation.  Even a freshly cooled can tastes like it's been left open all day and then put back in the refridge.  The less carbonation works great in their fruity drinks, but not this one.  Also, at a 130 calories per can, you will not get skinny drinking this stuff.

review/summary: Fasting Tea to lose weight
review/text: I love this tea!!! I have lost weight 2 times using it as an "assistant". The first time I lost close to 50 lbs then I got pregnant. After I was done breastfeeding my son I got back on the tea and a diet and lost about 50 lbs again. It is amazing stuff. It cleanses your blood, and liver; helps you last to your next meal and makes the weight come off faster. If you want to fast for spiritual reasons it is fantastic because it helps keep up your energy but if you want to loose weight it is awesome when used with a diet. It helped keep me on track and I was able and had less desire to cheat but more so it made the process speed up.<br /><br />Now with herbs it can take some time before you really see the difference. In my experience it took 1 to 2 months of drinking 2 cups per day before I really noticed a significant difference but that because the herbs have to get to work and they are not like a modern medicine they are gradual but very, very effective.<br /><br />I can't say enough about this tea. Thank you for this wonderful organic product Yogi Tea!

While I am waiting, I usually microwave some left-over meat and, if I'm up for it, some vegetables.  Then I get a larger bowl and pour everything into it, add some hot sauce, and sit down for a filling and delicious lunch.<br /><br />Plus the bowls are useful too, I keep some in the art corner for various projects & water while the kids paint, and I keep some in the kitchen to use for short-term storage while cooking or to store small amounts of food overnight in the fridge.<br /><br />While Ramen has a soft spot in my heart for getting me through college, Thai Kitchen noodles are my favorite.

Having ordered less expensive arrangements from this vendor in the past, I find their decision to offer a lesser product (and with no offer of a refund for the downgrade) inexcusable. I do not recommend this vendor, and will not use them in the future. Their quality control (not to mention customer service) is obviously slipping; I recommend you take your business elsewhere.

review/text: I purchased the pack of five for $23.59. what i got was one pack for 12.99.  when i went back to the site, i clicked on the pack of five and it took me to the page to order, but it didn't have the pack of five highlighted so i got the other.  i should have spotted that, but it was down lower than the screen.  it had the right type of cookie highlighted so i assumed(my favorite word)everything was correct.  this is the first time this has happened.  they need to fix this.  who would buy one package of cookies for almost half the cost of a pack of five.

review/summary: PEPPERIDGE FARM COOKIES-SOFT BAKED CAPTIVA(PACK OF 5)
review/text: An astonishingly delicious soft baked chocolate brownie cookie by Pepperidge Farm, at a great price of only 13.00 for 5 packages that normally go for $3.49 each through Amazon.com seeing it rarely if never goes on sale at the supermarket unlike Pepperidge Farm's Milano Brand Line of cookies and their Goldfish Crackers all of the time. Great purchase at the right price when available! ENJOY!!!

review/summary: BROKEN COOKIES, BAD PACKAGING
review/text: These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, "Don't call here anymore."

review/summary: Throw Into Montauk's Waters
review/text: This is the only kind of Pepperidge Farm cookies that I have had in my lifetime that are just terrible. Very strange...the chips are great, but the cookie part of, well, these cookies, has a nondescript, bland, processed/white-sugar taste. No, you cannot compare the taste to a sugar cookie- it's like an alien's version of a chocolate-chip cookie hastily made in order to use to lure a human to its/his/her spacecraft. The brown sugar is just not kickin' here, so just kick these to the curb.
