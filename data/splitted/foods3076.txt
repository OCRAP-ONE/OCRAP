Plus it is delivered to my door and no shipping charge (Super Saver Shipping), and costs less than the product I used to buy, saving me time and money.

review/summary: Dog loves this food!
review/text: I have a two-year old Jack Russell Terrier and she loves Newman's Own Dog Food! She ate Beneful for a year before switching. This goes down much easier. She doesn't each eat it "just because she's hungry"; she actually likes it! I highly recommend this product and would consider giving any dog nothing less!

review/summary: Great product just need to adjust the subscription.
review/text: My two small dogs took to the food immediately so well in fact I have had to move up the subscription for the 12 pound bag. Since they are young its not immediate if they look healthier or bouncier as they seem to be that way all the time. What I have noticed is there business is allot more controlled and any problems such as regurgitation which I had in past products have gone away. If your a prime member I would suggest setting up a subscription and be rid of of the chore of last minute runs to buy dog food and also know you are giving your pets a quality tier of dog food.

review/summary: first rate dog food
review/text: Newman's Own has been an excellent choice for my dog. The ingredients are organic and high quality; her coat is beautifully conditioned and she has never had an allergic response as with some of the more expensive products from the vet's office. Also, she is a small dog and the kibble bits are easy for her to chew.  It was annoying that the price was reduced between the time of my order and the delivery, but Amazon made an immediate adjustment.  I like the 4-pound bags for freshness because my dog is small and takes awhile to eat that much, but there are other sizes available to suit larger dogs.

review/summary: My dog loves it!
review/text: I have a 3 year old Boston Terrier who is not only a picky eater, but most dog foods give him bad gas.  I searched high and low for several months for a dog food that would help with his stomach issues and finally found another brand of dog food that, while not organic, helped relieve the gas problem.<br />After finishing a bag of the old brand, I stumbled across this on amazon one cold day and thought I'd take a chance and see if he'd like it or not.  I'm happy to report that he loves it AND it doesn't give him horrible gas at all.  His coat is shiny and healthy, as well.  The only downside I can see--like the other brand--is the price.  But being that the product is high quality and organic, I can't argue that too much.  Plus, with amazon's subscribe and save, I get it at a discount and delivered right to my front door.  You definitely can't beat that!<br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with this and will continue to purchase.

review/summary: so good even a dog does not turn its nose up at it.
review/text: I bought this dog food initally because I like everything that I have tried from Newmans Products for humans. So, I thought that my Pug, Chloe may like Newmans also. Well, she sure does, there is no turning up her nose at it. I get it delivered regualry, so this negates the need to make a special trip to get Dog food.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/12/15  the last two bags I recieved had a mite in the foods which caused my dog to have severe bouts of diarrhea. I only found out today when I took her to the vet, and was informed that these intestinal bugs were usually located in the dog food. Sure enough, when I got home and looked in the dog food, guess what I cfound on the bottom of the bag, tiny mites.......it went out into the garbage containers.<br /><br />I will return to this dog food in a few months......she ahs liked it so much, but will wait for a bit.

review/text: and I love buying it for her. Not only is it a healthy organic meal, I personally like what the Newman Foundation does with their profits (after taxes) from their products.....$265 MILLION has been donated to various charities to date by their foundation. I buy Newman's Own products whenever I can (their spaghetti sauce is out-of-this-world..."Roasted Garlic"...YUM!).<br /><br />My dog has eaten this food for years and years until, out of the blue, my local grocer decided not to sell it anymore. I then had to grab a bag of food for her because we were out completely and decided to get Beneful. Apparently, her digestive system didn't like it and she ended up with bloody stools. That's when I came to Amazon.com (a GODSEND for people like me who have lame grocery stores to shop from) and found her Newman's Own dog food! I can always depend on Amazon.com. I've now got this on auto-delivery. I trust Newman's Own products and I know my dog is getting a well-balanced organic meal and it's Melamine-free.

review/summary: Best Dog Food Ever!
review/text: Newman's Own is the best dog food ever, in my opinion. My 12 year old white German Shepard eats and digests this food wonderfully. Before changing to this food a few years ago, she had digestive problems often, even though she was fed a "so called good brand name food".  My three year old pittie girl also eats this food, and loves it .. she is in perfect health. I would recommend it to anyone. My next door neighbor orders it now from Amazon for his pittie girl. Amazon is a wonderful place to purchase dog and cat food, groceries, and anything you need .. the prices are always good, and the specials are great! The specials are the best ever, and I was shocked to find out that a today "Friday" special price on Newman's Own dog food was automatically reflected in my subscribe and save item price of the Newman's Own.  Even though I just received a bag yesterday, I ordered two more today, and some Newman's Own cat food.  What other retailer would automatically do that for you .. none that I know of.  Amazon .. please continue to offer the Newman's Own dog food .. I would be lost without the delivery, since it is difficult for me to get out and shop and carry large items like bags of dog food.  Thank you for being here for me and Snowey and Sophie.<br />  Linda

review/summary: Great for dogs with allergies
review/text: I was giving my dogs Science Diet Puppy food from the time I got them at 8 weeks. Science Diet changed the formula about 3 months ago and the food just did not smell or look right. It was very oily and fishy smelling, which I realize they did at more fish oil. After about three weeks of the new food, I noticed my puppies (well now 1 year olds) skin was very flaky like dandruff and they both had been continuous licking their paws. I took them to the vet and he said they had food allergies. He wanted me to take them off the Science diet and put them on pumpkin and pinto beans for 7 weeks. Well, under duress I tried it and my dogs did not eat for 3 days. I decided to try the Newman's organic and after about 4 weeks their coat looks so much better and the licking has really decreased. I am so glad I saw this food when I was doing research.

review/text: I love the other kinds, especially apple and pear. But these are hard, crumbly, and I personally cannot even taste pineapple. I just tasted a piece and hated it. I complained originally about these because I didn't see anywhere in the description that they come from CHINA. Unless I missed it somewhere, but I reread the description and still don't see it. I really don't want fruit from China (or any other foreign country). I only found out that when I read "Product of China" on the brown box they came in.<br /><br />I found out that some of the other kinds of fruit are from China, Ecuador, Chile, and the USA. How about producing products in our own country??<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone for the taste, the texture, and the origin. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.

review/summary: AWFUL flavor, unless you happen to like the flavor of cardboard!
review/text: We LOVE freeze dried fruits and vegetables in our house as snacks.  My kids eat freeze dried peas, corn, apples, pears, mango, and pineapple from several other companies, so when these were on sale, I thought I was getting a deal for small lunch box sized snacks.  I bought apples, pears, peaches, and pineapples.  The apples and pears leave something to be desired in terms of flavor in my opinion, but my kids like them well enough, so I won't complain.  The peaches and pineapples, however, are AWFUL!!!  The peaches taste stale despite not being expired and the pineapple consists of tasteless little slivers of fruit and fruit dust.  There are no chunks like the other brands we buy, and the flavor tastes more like cardboard than any recognizable fruit.  The kids won't eat them, nor will I, and Brother won't take them back unless I pay the return shipping, which winds up being half of what they cost, so we're stuck with dozens of bags of awful fruit.  Maybe I'll feed it to the birds and squirrels in the spring!<br /><br />Save your money and buy Sensible Foods or Just brand freeze-dried fruits and vegetables instead.

review/summary: Great, kids and husband love them
review/text: BUT, I do admit that they need bigger slices.  there are a lot of crumbles in the bottom of the bag.  IT shocks me that it takes so many pinnaple to make a bag, and am happy it makes my family eat more fruit.  This is my husbands favorite flavor, and he doesnt like the pear or the apple.  I like the pear flavors, and think the strawberry and bannana is ok.  This one is just a little tart, which I like better then a sweet-sweet taste.  pinnaple is a fiberous fruit, so its not going to be all smooth and melt in your mouth-like.  All those fibers you have in the regular pinnaple before its dried remain!! it gives it more of a tuff texture then the other flavors, but true to the fruit.

review/summary: Not what I envisioned...
review/text: The picture is misleading. The product arrived in a bubble wrap package with advertising, about 10 times the size needed for the 2x3 inch plastic ziplock containing the actual strainer bag. They could've shipped it in a letter size envelope for less than a buck, but they charged me nine extra to send me crap that I threw away. Once I opened the product I immediately noticed that it was sewn all the way around with a double cross stitch. Looks like it'll hold up, but the picture implied that it was without a seam, which is what I really wanted. I used it once so far, for kefir, and it felt very thin, but it is a very fine filter mesh so it makes sense. It's also somewhat bigger than I thought it would be. I wouldn't buy this product again for this purpose, but I'll try using it for coffee as the reviewer before me has.<br />It's not actually a four star product in my view, but it's not so bad as three stars and there's no in between.

review/text: I really don't understand why Aleppo Pepper is the new "It" spice. We do use it in everything--but all of our meals are typical Aleppine foods.<br /><br />Anyway, since Syria is a war zone at the minute, we can't get this. We were sorely missing it. All the other sites I found offered only very small quantities at ridiculous prices--and shipping rates that border on extortion :D. I finally found some here, at a very reasonable price--with free shipping. I would recommend using their website rather than ordering through Amazon. It was a very good,user friendly site with a lot more information and variety than they coculd squeeze in here. I actually got a confirmation e-mail about half an hour after I placed my order, and another that it was shipped just a few minutes or so later. Bravo!!<br /><br />As for the pepper, I ordered 5 lbs. It is a little coarser than I would prefer, but very good quality, and very nicely packed. Also, I placed my order late Friday afternoon and got it at my door at 8:00 Monday morning. They also included 2 free bonuses, one of which was an entire pound of some Applewood Smoked Sea Salt (which but I have not used, but it smells so good), the other was a 1 oz package of my choice (I got ground chipotle); I think maybe these promotions change by the week, but I am not sure. I had never done business with this company before, and usually only write a review if I love something or hate it. I am very impressed with this retailer; I will certainly use them again. and will recommend them to everyone I know.

The Strawberry might be slightly better.  I'd like to try the other flavors, and I don't think I'll be disappointed.

review/text: Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour.  That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.<br />They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item.

review/summary: Lots of Sugar!
review/text: I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like "Pop Tarts" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item.

review/text: I tried these, even though I haven't had a toaster "pastry" since I was a kid (and didn't much care for them then, either).  For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle.  However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again.  They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of "frosting" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much "sweet cardboard".  Just not really worth eating, in my opinion.  A piece of toast with jam is more appealing.

They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors.<br /><br />This doesn't make them completely "healthy" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome.

review/summary: A tasty, kosher, healthier alternative to Pop Tarts
review/text: First and foremost, these toaster pastries taste great! You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy.

It might have more of a berry flavor to it.  Compared to a pop tart they're not as flavorful, but they're a step in the healthy direction.  They've got enough sweet to get the job done. Make sure whichever one you buy, that you get the frosted and not the plain.  The plain is too dull without the frosting complimenting it. The only fruit flavor left for me to try now is the blueberry.

review/summary: These are good pastries
review/text: I went out and bought the frosted Strawberry.  I must say I really like them.  The first time I tried this product was in the Apple Cinnamon flavor that was not frosted.  Like some of the other posters have stated, go for the frosted.  The plain ones are ok, but the frosted ones hits the spot.<br /><br />For me it is hard to decide which is better, the Strawberry or the Apple Cinnamon.  I haven't tried the Blueberry yet, but I'm tempted to see how it tastes.

review/text: Yes, these Toaster Pastries from Nature's Path are the only thing my 3-year-old will eat for her breakfast.  Thanksfully, they are fairly healthy.  Now her 2 older brothers are making it a staple for their breakfast also.  They are very tasty and toast well in the toaster.  The frosted strawberry and blueberry ones are equally as good - just depends on your taste preference.  We have not tried any of the UNfrosted ones though!

review/summary: Great "on the go" healthy snack....
review/text: Two out of my three boys love these toaster pastries.  They are pretty healthy for them and are a great snack to throw in my bag when we are on the go.  My only suggestion would be to wrap them individually, because I only let them have one at a time, which is plenty.  Or, to eliminate unnecessary packaging, pack them without the individual wrappers in the box.

I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.<br /><br />Nature's Path Organic Apple Cinnamon Toaster Pastries do taste "slightly" healthy, but they remind me of some nutmeg cookies I make that are also made with whole-wheat flour.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic apple cinnamon filling (organic evaporated cane juice, organic apple juice concentrate, water, organic evaporated apples, vegetable glycerin, organic apple powder, organic corn startch, organic cinnamon, locust bean gum), organic whole-wheat flour, organic white flour, water, organic evaporated cane juice, organic palm oil, powdered organic eveaporated cane juice, organic invert syrup, salt, leavening, natural flavor, agar, tocopherols (for freshness).<br /><br />Unfortunately these do contain palm oil, although I don't seem to be as allergic to organic palm oil. Makes me wonder what I'm really allergic to, as in what is in the additional element in the non-organic Palm Kernel Oil. Could it simply be that this is the non-hydrogenated version. Could be.<br /><br />Each pastry is 190 Calories<br /><br />40 Calories from Fat<br /><br />They heat up fast in the toaster and are convenient for a snack.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: BEST TOASTER PASTRY
review/text: These are the very best of any organic or non-organic toaster pastry we have ever tried.  Cherry Pomegran is the favorite flavor in our house.  It has a real fruit taste and a real pastry taste, not like regular brand & store brands that have always left me with indigestion and a lingering unpleasant taste.  Plus they have healthier ingredients than regular brands so I can feel good about giving these one or two times a week for really quick breakfasts or on the go breakfast when necessary.  We have embraced organic foods since the mid 1990's and these are among the best.  Amazon offers a better deal  than the ones we got at retail store.  By the way, strawberry frosted is our family's second favorite flavor.  Recommend trying them.  Five stars for sure.

review/text: Every one of my children love these toaster pastries...which is hard to accomplish in this house!  I had originally purchased them from our local health food store($3.89/box) because my pickiest eater begged for them.  Obviously, I'm not going to continuously pay that much for a box of 6 toaster pastries.  So, I went on the hunt for the best price.  I purchased these through Subscribe & Save on Amazon and I get them for $2.29/box with free shipping.  That means I don't even have to go TO the store.  What a deal!  We're going to try the Wildberry Acai next...I'll let you know what we think of those!

review/text: These are a great alternative to PopTarts. I've only tried the strawberry. Crust, icing, filling - all are delicious. My only change would be to make the filling thicker. The outer edges of the crust can be a little dry without a bit of the filling to go with it so I find myself breaking off the outside edges to get to the yummy middle. Maybe I'm just picky. But otherwise, I love them!

review/summary: A Sinful Treat... With A Little Less Sin
review/text: Okay, in the grand scheme of things, if you're closely watching your calorie intake... these aren't for you. Yes, they are organic! LOVE that they are organic! But they have similar stats to their non-organic counterpart (one of these toaster pastries has 210 calories and 5g fat while the other non-organic brand's toaster pastries average the same - 210 calories and 5g fat). However, it's nice to see that the first ingredient in Nature's Path Frosted Raspberry toaster pastries is Organic Wheat Flour, while the other brand's first ingredient is enriched flour). At any rate, I picked up two different flavors of Nature's Path toaster pastries from my local Whole Foods and I haven't been able to stop eating them since. I bought the Wildberry Acai on Amazon without having tried them first, since I had yet to be disappointed by a flavor of theirs to date. While they are not my favorite flavor (the iced Raspberry and Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are beyond amazing), they definitely leave my tastebuds satisfied. I wouldn't say these are guilt-free, but I do feel less guilty knowing that they are organic!

review/summary: Not health food, but far, far better than Pop-Tarts
review/text: Making the change from a typical American diet to a healthier organic and more whole-grain centered diet is no mean feat with my 6-year-old.  I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.  I refuse to buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it so, needless to say, Pop-Tarts are not known in my house.  When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.  What a concept.<br /><br />I also want to note that purchasing them through subscribe and save is a considerable savings over buying them in the grocery store.  When all is said and done, I'll have paid about a dollar a box less by ordering these through Amazon rather than buying them at Whole Foods.  I not only like to eat healthier, I also like to trim the fat from my wallet.

review/summary: A healthier version of the popular breakfast pastry...
review/text: We've been on a pomegranate kick lately and my wife saw these Organic `Toaster Pastries' (don't call them Pop-Tarts) and snatched them up the other day.  She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).  These organic pastries are really good and taste pretty much exactly like a Pop-Tart, they even look just like them.  I won't take that step and say that they taste `better', but they taste pretty much the same.  The Cherry Pomegranate flavor is really good, although I would have like more pomegranates.  Instead, I get a lot of cherry.  That is the only reason I give this four stars instead of five.  If you put a flavor on the box, you should represent that flavor well in the pastry and these should have merely been called `Cherry' because that is the only flavor I get.  Still, as a whole you can't go wrong with these Organic pastries.  They are more expensive than your typical Pop-Tarts, and you get less in a box as well, but for peace of mind as a parent they are worth it.

review/summary: Tastes great, still like nearly candy but at least natural
review/text: I saw these at Big Lots for two bucks a box of six so I bought a few.  I'm not one to buy stuff and eat this type of sugary snack on a regular basis (or at least I refuse to see myself as someone who does), but the organic label was interesting so I gave it a try.  I suppose it helps me rationalize eating them if they are organic, because the more unhealthy and unnatural contents of the mainstream competitive products, in combination to the calories and sugar for this type of "food," is generally enough to dissuade me from buying them.<br /><br />I have eaten Pop Tarts before, and these are every bit as good and tasty or better.  I haven't eaten enough Pop Tarts to be really familar with the varieties and all that, but I think these Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries are not lacking in any way at all compared to my recollection of the artificial and non-organic/natural conventional products.  These were not dry or bland or stale or anything like that.  The only drawback at all I could find with them is the calories and sugar content.<br /><br />The one that I tried is the strawberry frosted style.  If I see more at Big Lots, I'll be picking up some more.

review/text: First, I'd agree with everyone here who says this isn't a "healthy" food.  Because it's really not.  Lots of sugar in this.  But as a snack, it sure beats a lot of the other sugary treats out there, and it tastes good enough, that your kids won't feel deprived if you give them this instead of a twinky.  We also like that it's organic, since we have some issues with GMO foods- allergy type issues, not philosophical issues (not that there's anything wrong with philosophical issues, but ours is a true allergy).<br /><br />And if you want to be really decadent, when you go camping, you can toast marshmallows, and toast these (or not toast them) and use them to make a pretty darn good smore-like creation.

review/summary: Not too sweet, better pop tart
review/text: What I like about this product:<br /><br />- made with better ingredients<br />- frosted but not too sweet<br /><br />Admit it, we all love pop tarts but those things have way too many unnecessary ingredients and sugar. I was so happy Nature's Path provided an alternative. I love the acai flavor; it is not too sweet but still satisfying the need for a sweet tooth.
