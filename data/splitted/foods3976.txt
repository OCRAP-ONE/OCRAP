review/summary: Makes an Awesome Iced Tea!
review/text: This tea is clean in its taste and finish; it has a genuine apricot flavor, no funny fake flavoring in this tea. Nor does it contain hibiscus, rose hips, or lemongrass, which are part of a lot of the apricot-flavored teas out there. It is green tea and genuine apricot, and nothing else! We like it so much as an iced tea that I've put it on the Subscribe-and-Save purchase program, to make sure we never run out!

review/summary: Disappointed in this one.
review/text: I have been trying to find a decaf apricot loose leaf tea that compares with one served at a little cafe I frequented in the Dallas metroplex. I was so hoping this would be the one but it isn't. It has a 'bite' to it that I don't care for. I tried mixing in plain green tea, at first by half then 3/4ths and I just can't drink it. Very disappointed :-(.

review/summary: A lot more convenient than a communal dipping dish
review/text: I frequently entertain guests who enjoy my cooking, Many of my guests have some to enjoy an dipping sauce for their bread, so I set the table with these.<br /><br />While some restaurants that bring out a bread and a dipping sauce use a communal dish, I prefer to allow my guests to have more control over their sauce. Each guest gets one of these saucers, and I place the following on the table for their own mixing: a high quality olive oil, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAWHPM">Alessi Dipping Spice Grinder, 0.76-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019S5444">Alessi Whole Mix Peppercorns, 1.12-Ounce Grinder (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB0DMU">Alessi Grinder Sea Salt, 5.64-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>. For those who love to mix in basalmic vinegar I have a special treat awaiting them on the table: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CFO37Y">Gia Russa Balsamic Glaze</a>.<br /><br />Another way I use these is when I am measuring out spices for some dishes. I will measure out each spice into one or more of these saucers and mix them before adding them to whichever dish I am preparing. This prevents accidentally over spicing the meal because you can always pour too much spice back into its container a lot easier than removing it from a boiling pot!<br /><br />The saucers are heavy duty (I love their heft), easy to care for and convenient. I have always cleaned mine in a dishwasher with no adverse effects, so I am reasonably certain that they are dishwasher-safe.<br /><br />I usually do not entertain more than three people for dinners, so this pack is more than adequate for me. If you are used to larger parties, by additional packs.

review/summary: The Pride of Sanger
review/text: My wife is from Fresno and brought this into the marriage. The big country-style ak-mak is ten times better than the little crackers. Break off a chunk the size of a credit card, spread it with unsalted butter, and cover it with a vegetable-peeler shaving of romano cheese. Serve it to a room full of church ladies and they'll body-check each other into the boards to get the last piece.<br />At Amazon's price for the Country Style, it's way cheaper than Triscuits. And I'd much rather give the money to the Soojians than to Nabisco.

review/summary: Only reduced a star because of no description.
review/text: I wasn't sure what "Country Style" meant so I looked it up.<br /><br />These are large sheets of flat bread that can be stored in the cupboard and used as needed. All it takes is a few seconds under the cold water tap on each side, five minutes in a zip-top plastic bag, and the bread is soft and ready to go.<br /><br />Besides great taste, you'll get three grams of fiber -- three times as much as two thin slices of white bread -- in each third of a sheet. And thanks to the whole wheat, you'll also be getting the vitamins E and B-6, chromium, copper, and phytochemicals that are milled away when flour is refined. [...].<br /><br />My only remaining question, is whether it can be used dry...like a cracker.  I wasn't able to find that, so I will continue to buy just the "Plain".

review/summary: Not as good as the smaller boxes
review/text: I like AK Mak crackers.  I bought this size box because the AK MAK crackers I usually buy were not available on Amazon.  I regret my haste.<br /><br />These crackers are far bigger than the regular size crackers.  This size difference compounds a problem that also exists in the smaller box size; i.e. the lack of a resealable package.  All of the crackers are in one big package, but because the nature of how they are packaged, it is not easy to reseal them.<br /><br />Buy the smaller package size.

review/text: This is the best dressing ever!! I can no longer find it in the grocery stores, so I went on line and Amazon.com has it. I ordered it in January of this year 2010. My oldest son was over a few weeks ago and I had made a salad, he used it felled in love, went to Wal-Mart could not find it, called me and I told him I have two bottles left and that he could have one of them. He was over here just the other day and said that his wife loves it, asked me if I had order any more. I promise you, you will not be displeased with this dressing. I just ordered a case and plan to share it with my son. This is the greatest of the greatest in sun dried tomato vinaigrette dressing. I just put it on my index finger and eat as is, I'm sure it's taste just as good on the other fingers, good on salads also. I hope Amazon.com NEVER discontinue this product, it would be a living shame and disgrace for The Kraft family, Amazon.com, and my family. Keep up the great work Amazon.com!!!!!

review/summary: N O T......B A D...............B U T........
review/text: It is delightfully convenient to buy bread on Amazon.com!  It is also very nice to be able to buy EUROPEAN bread.  I don't remember what health-food book I read this in, but, in passing, this book mentioned that Americans, (especially American children), who visit Europe are often heard to joyfully be saying: "Have you tasted the BREAD?!!!!!"<br /><br />MESTERNACHER THREE-GRAIN BREAD is my first European bread.  It is tasty, (I was afraid I wouldn't like the taste) -- yet, my American taste still would like a sweeter bread.  Still, not bad tasting at all.  The truly wonderful thing about this bread, however, is that IT CONTAINS NO WHEAT!  Wheat has its place in the diet, I suppose...but limiting it is important, because, amongst other things, wheat is said to be bad for people with arthritis of ANY kind, and wheat is also said to be bad for ANYONE'S eyes.  I'm not too knowedgeable about wheat's good and bad qualties -- but I do know the above two facts.  I also have heard bad things about wheat GLUTEN.  Presumably, wheat products without the gluten are better than those with gluten. Mestermacher Three-Grain Bread, however, has NO WHEAT AT ALL.  So, one does not have to worry about any bad effects of wheat, at all!<br /><br />What does this bread have in it, if it doesn't have wheat?  The ingredient list is:<br /><br />Whole Kernel Rye<br />Water<br />Wholemeal Rye Flour<br />Oat Kernels<br />Barley Kernels<br />Linseed<br />Salt<br />Oat Fibre<br />Sesame<br />Yeast<br /><br />It is mentioned underneath the ingredients list that this bread containes Sesame.  Obviously, some people are allergic to sesame.  And, perhaps, some of the other ingredients?  Anyway, the ingredient list is above...and, of course, on each loaf wrapper.<br /><br />Also listed are special attributes of this bread:<br /><br />No preservatives<br />Kosher = K parev<br />High Fibre<br />Cholesterol Free<br />Natural Ingredients<br />Long Shelf Life<br />Wheat Free<br /><br />The second-to-the-last attribute, "Long Shelf Life" is due to the fact that THIS BREAD IS PASTEURIZED. (But, as mentioned above, it still tastes pretty good, unlike many other pasteurized products....)  The expiration date on the bread I have bought, is 12 - 12 - 2010 -- NINE MONTHS from the day I first opened the package, (YESTERDAY), and ate my first piece!<br /><br />Opened loaves, (there are 12 in the package), must be refrigerated, and eaten within 4 days.  But each loaf contains only 7 slices!  This makes it easy to eat the entire (nice and thinly-sliced) loaf in the required 4 days. It' interesting that there are SEVEN pieces in each loaf.  Usually, of course, it takes TWO pieces of any type of bread to make a sandwich.....<br /><br />But this bread is NOT shaped square-ishly, like most American breads.  No, as can clearly be seen from the photos here, it is RECTANGULARLY shaped.  This would seem to make it easy to simply slice the bread in half, and make a small sandwhich from the two pieces.  However, the texture of this bread will not allow this. Or, at least the texture of the bread I bought will not allow this.  As I said, the bread I have has a shelf-life of NINE months (left?).  I have no idea how long the bread's shelf-life is, when it first is baked.  IF it is one year, than I am missing three months -- and the bread, though fresh(ish?) is very, (very) slightly brittle. As a single-slice, it breaks off neatly, but if I was to try to cut it in half, and make a sandwich, I'm sure many, many crumbs would result.  Maybe this would happen even if the bread were at its freshest: the picture on the wrapper shows an OPEN-FACED sandwich "serving suggestion", using only one piece of bread....<br /><br />Or perhaps, because of the ALL-natural ingredients, no "dough conditioners" or other ingredients to make the bread soft enough to "fold", as most American breads do.  I wish a natural dough-conditioner, (or other ingredient), could be found, so that this fine, natural bread, would be as pliable as American breads are.<br /><br />I guess this "unfoldability" is my main complaint about this bread, and why I give it only 4 stars.  It is, however, quite good tasting, (minus the American-type sweetness I, personally, so enjoy), and it does make one feel good that one is NOT eating wheat, and is enjoying all-natural ingredients, and a high-fibre content, whilst eating this tasty bread!

review/text: Remove the hot toasted bread and immediately rub garlic on both sides which generally takes one whole pealed large clove.  We also place sheep or goat cheese on it in the toaster oven until the former is melted completely.  This lead us to make mini-pizzas which we also enjoy since normal pizzas are wheat flour based. Don't forget Mestemacher also has this an ORGANIC three-grain bread which is about a third higher in price for those of you who try to keep to an organic foodsource regimen.  This is a great way to enjoy both worlds at the same time. I can't tell any difference in taste between these two breads.  Dr. Hatfield

review/summary: Gourmet sauce, incredible convenience.
review/text: Anyone who has prepared mole poblano from scratch knows that it is a very labor intensive process, involving lots of ingredients and many steps before achieving the final result. Barcelona's Mole Poblano eliminates the hard work and allows you to be a creative chef in an instant. Whether you want to impress guests at a dinner party or simply want to dress up some leftover chicken or turkey, this delicious sauce adds an authentic Mexican flavor to any meal. This recipe has been in the Riquelme family for generations and they take great pride in using only the finest and freshest ingredients. Barcelona's Mole Poblano is more complex than most commercially available mole poblano sauces and the flavors open up on the palate like a fine wine. Although it is recommended as a topping sauce, it also makes a spicy and unique fondue dipping sauce. And even though it is recommended for use with poultry, it is equally delectable on hearty winter vegetables like roasted sweet potatoes or butternut squash. A simple bowl of brown rice becomes an exquisite snack with a drizzle of this sauce. If you are a fan of mole poblano, I cannot recommend Barcelona's Mole Poblano highly enough.

After that begged friends and relatives to bring back some for my wife and I when they went there. It wasn't until recently I discoverd the Amazon.com sold this coffee on its web site. It is not generally available in the U.S.. The cost of this coffee, per pound,(including shipping)is less than most coffee in the U.S. It is shipped in .5 kilo bags which is actually 1.1 lbs. It is actually shipped from Costa Rica from a suburb of San Jose and takes about 7 to 9 days depending on where you live. Mine took 7 days and was shipped by a bonded carrier. Plan ahead.

review/summary: Perfect little snack!
review/text: My son loves these little multicolored stars. So far, we've tried to spinach and apple as well as the mango and sweet potato. He loves them both! They are the perfect size for his little hands and one of the first foods he started to feed himself at around 8 months.<br /><br />ORGANIC. I chose these puffs because I wanted an alternative to cheerios and other genetically modified cereals. I love that these are organic and feature flavors that are both wholesome and tasty. I've tried them myself and they are yummy!<br /><br />NO ARTIFICIAL INGREDIENTS. This is a must have for foods I feed my baby.<br /><br />BPA FREE PACKAGING. I love that these come in BPA free and recyclable packaging.<br /><br />CONVENIENT. These are perfect for on the go. We bring this with us where ever we go and its the perfect little snack for my son.<br /><br />The only thing I can say thats negative about these puffs is that they go stale fast! My son is about 9 months old and doesn't eat a lot of these at once. It states on the packaging that they should be used within 1 week for optimal freshness. It takes my son about 3 weeks to finish a package. This caused me to give it four stars instead of five. However, I will still definitely try the other flavors that Plum has available!

review/summary: Daughter Loves the Super Puffs
review/text: My daughter really likes this product.  She seems to like all of the Plum Organics products we've tried thus far so I would say this is a pretty safe purchase for those who haven't given it to their baby yet.<br /><br />This product doesn't "fill her up" but rather helps her develop her hand mouth coordination as I put them on her highchair and she reaches for them and tries to feed herself.  She is more skilled at feeding herself the Mum Mums but she is really making progress with the Super Puffs as well.  They seem to be softer and dissolve more quickly than Cheerios which I fed my older two as babies...

review/summary: Power Puff for Digestive Health Leads the Pack!
review/text: Searching for a low-sugar wheat-free puff to offer my baby girls, I discovered Plum Organics with much joy. Clearly superior to all other major brands of baby puffs for digestive health, who's better than Plum for my family? I've successfully battled to contain a serious digestive disorder called Ulcerative Colitis for over a decade in part by special attention to diet. In that time I've learned even moderate amounts of wheat causes problems by creating an overgrowth of Candida yeast in my system. Some know this as a sensitivity to gluten or sugars, others suffer without realizing as so many foods contain wheat or high amounts of sugar. For me it's cumulative folks, a little in nearly everything really piles up. I notice my body getting too much as soon as I begin to heavily crave breads or sugars.  Before you know it, that gummy gluten renders me 90% incapable of absorbing nutrition altogether.<br /><br />Back to the Puffs... wheat is high in gluten, but the oat and rice based Puff offered by Plum Organics stands out with ingredients more gentle on digestive function. This is in addition to providing all the stuff HappyBaby remains conscious of, like sugar and vitamin content. Rice is gluten-free and minimally processed oat may be too, but many still leave it off the list of gluten-free foods due to typical cross-contamination issues with lots of wheat growing and processed alongside oats. Small amounts are ok with me anyway -- I'm looking for regulation rather than elimination here. So I'm happy to introduce all these foods to my daughters at healthy levels.<br /><br />How about the sugar content? Super low, and only natural organic fruit, vegetable or cane juice is used (not corn-syrup as another reviewer erroneously reported -- [...]. And can we really get upset about a little blueberry or sweet potato juice temporarily staining a cloth when you account for their health properties? Regulate, read the labels for yourself and take joy in offering your kids a simple, low sugar, high vitamin, low gluten snack.<br /><br />Oh and must say, I love that they're mainly just puffed air with a fantastic balance of nutrients. 1/2 cup or about 75 pieces per serving keeps my little dears engaged in motor development and feeding skills for a while without concern for dietary imbalance.<br /><br />Bunch of facts, all packed up to help someone out there enjoy a little extra peace next time they offer Plum Puffs to their kids.  Live well!

review/summary: Good product; funny smell.
review/text: Got these for my 12 month old to add a little variation to her snack foods.  I was not a fan of the Gerber puffs because of all the added "stuff" they have.  My daughter likes these and I have to admit, they taste pretty good (mostly like apple).  However, they really stink.  Sometimes I mistake the smell for a dirty diaper.  I probably would not buy this flavor again, but I would definitely buy this brand in a different flavor.

review/summary: SUGAR FOR BABIES = NO THANK YOU!
review/text: As far as taste goes, these are great... but of course they are, they are loaded with sugar!!!!! Organic dried cane syrup sounds like it's okay, but it's just a fancy way of wording the fact that these are made with SUGAR. There are other brands out there (would name them, but do not want the credibility of my review to plummet in case someone thinks I'm "working" for one of these other brands) that sweeten their puffs with fruit juice, a MUCH healthier option over these Plum brand puffs made with sugar. I am disappointed that I bought FOUR of these... save YOUR money and look elsewhere for a healthier option for your child :)

review/summary: Weird smell
review/text: I like the idea of vegetables in puffs, because I'm concerned about my son getting enough veggies in his diet. I purchased these thinking they would be like the HappyBaby greens puffs he likes so much. These taste ok, but the smell is absolutely horrible. The first days he ate them I thought he had messed his diaper, and was confused as to why his diaper was empty. I then realized it was the PUFFS! The other Plum Organics puffs smell fine, but these are NAUSEATING!

review/summary: Love the Doggie Litter System!
review/text: During the frigid winter, we brought home two toy fox terrier/pug mixes, and this has helped out immensely! At 1.4 pounds, they were to small to go outside to go potty, so they could go in the litter pan anytime they had to go. We had very little difficulty in teaching the dogs where to go. It is ideal for us, because we work longs shifts and are not home on some days for 10+ hours.  Great for those who just moved, or are about to move to new construction home sites--it keeps the dogs out of the mud and dirt! The dogs do tend to eat the litter, but it is not harmful, and their stool is not difficult to pass when they have digested it. And, as the dogs have grown, we have gotten progressively bigger with the size of the litter pan.  I would not recommend this for a larger size dog!

review/summary: Here are some hints to help you transition or make the best out of pellet training your dog.
review/text: I can't really complain about a system that gives me peace of mind when I'm not at home.  My dog is 10 lbs and 11-months old.  I wouldn't recommend this product if you have a dog that's more than 30 pounds.  I would say a miniature spaniel or small cockerspaniel would be the top sized dog you'd want to use a litter box with.  But then again, if you have a large space like a connecting garage or a very large kitchen area and have space for an extra large tray, it could probably work too.<br /><br />Although I don't use my litter box outdoors, I can see this as a useful potty aid if you don't want your dog to mess up your outside garden area.  I'm thinking about adding a box outside because I don't have a lawn, and it's mostly concrete and dirt.<br /><br />My dog still enjoys his walks, and DOES go poop and pee outside in the park lawn whenever I take him.  He also goes inside his litter box, but it's not as preferable for him.  He will still pee on my carpet when he's roaming around and not near the litter box.  So my dog, even at 11 months old is not completely housebroken.  He's not a very smart dog, so I don't think he ever will be housebroken.  If you have a dog like mine, this might be your best solution.<br /><br />If I know that he has just eaten or drank a lot of water, I bring him back to the litter box after a couple of hours (which is in my laundry room) and close the door for a while or wait until he goes.  This is the only way to make sure he doesn't have accidents.  If your dog is paper trained or pad trained, you should follow the "transition" instructions on the Purina website.  My dog has only used the litter box since birth, but when he discovered the lawn, he never quite liked the litter box as much.<br /><br />So here is the best way to use this litter.<br /><br />1.  Only line the bottom of the tray with a small layer, just enough to cover the bottom.  This will save you A LOT of litter and cash in your pocket.  The instructions wants you to put in at least an inch of pellets.  I found it very wasteful and heavy to pick up and clean as well.<br /><br />2.  The second most important reason why you want just a THIN layer is because it's always best to replace your litter often.  This makes for less waste.<br /><br />3.  When your dog pees on the pellets, they swell up and you can tell which pellets have been soaked.  If you're careful, you can use a small scooper to clean that portion out and replace it with fresh pellets.<br /><br />4.  Also clean up poop out of the litter box on a daily basis or as soon as your dog poops.  This will prevent a smelly room, and encourage your dog to go back in the litter box.  My dog barks when there's poop in the box and tells me to clean it when he's in his room at night.  (He literally drags me out of bed with his barking!)  I just use some toilet paper to pick it up, and flush the poop down the toilet.  This saves on biodegradable poop bags and again, puts a little cash back in your pocket.<br /><br />5.  If you bought the Petco Blue litter box tray, there's some tricky placement to consider due to the foot ledge that sticks out.  Do read my review on the Petco blue litter box tray or remember these tips:<br /><br />a.  NEVER put the box flush against the wall.  This won't allow your dog ample space to roam around the litter box before it actually pees or poops.  This will limit the number of accidents outside of the box.  Also, if you have a male dog with a marking problem, you will see lots of urine on the floor next to the wall.<br /><br />b.  Face the foot ledge toward the wall, (if your room is narrow and long like a laundry room...this is where we put our tray) and leave some space between the foot ledge and the wall for your dog to walk around.<br /><br />c.  Be prepared to sop up pee on the foot ledge.  This will be a common place for your dog to have a pee or poop accident.  Still...better on the ledge than on the floor.  The blue raised circles on the foot ledge makes it difficult to clean urine.  I have to fold up my paper towels and sop around the circles.<br /><br />d.  Always use a doggie cleaner on the foot ledge after you clean up an accident on the foot ledge.  Your room will start to smell if you don't.<br /><br />e.  If you don't want to struggle with this seemingly difficult foot ledge, try the actual PURINA tray.  I think the trick is to have a high edge around the tray, so the dog is not tempted to be partially outside the tray when it is going pee or poop.<br /><br />f.  Wash your tray every week or at least every two weeks.  No matter how often you empty your pellets, the smell still gets on the tray itself.  There just isn't a perfect sanitary system.  I guess not having a dog is the perfect sanitary system!  :-)<br /><br />6.  Pellet bags are heavy...especially the 25 pound bag.  I bought a plastic bowl to help me scoop the pellets out and control the amount that goes in the tray.  No one wants to scoop the pellets BACK into the bag from a dirty tray after the fact.  Get the scooper...it will actually save you money by controlling the amount of pellets that go into the tray, AND your back in the long run.<br /><br />7.  To avoid your dog from chewing on the pellets, especially in the wee morning hours when it starts to get hungry, leave some treats around his room a night.  Be prepared to sweep up pellets on occasion.  A bored and hungry dog, makes for a naughty dog.<br /><br />8.  If you are transitioning your dog, make sure you put some of his urine soaked pads or newspapers inside the box so he can smell it in the early stages.  Your dog should adjust in about a week or two.<br /><br />Good Luck!

review/text: I trained my chihuahua to a litter box when we got her at 10 weeks, she was 1 pound and at 6 months is only 2 pounds. I do not like that this is a paper product, paper does not break down as well as wood pellets.<br /><br />I used wood pellets, I get 40 pounds for 5.00 and it last me 5 months. When Foxy poos I clean that right out. the pee soaks right away into the wood pellets. (get wood pellets at the hardware or safeway for  pellet burning stoves)..So it never goes to the bottom. I put in 2 inches. There is absolutely NO order and I change it out about every 2 weeks.<br /><br />But training a dog to use a litter pan is extremely easy!!!

review/summary: Pretty good product
review/text: I litter-box trained my small dog almost 7 years ago before there was such a thing as dog litter on the market.  (I just used cat litter.) However, the problem with cat litter in my situation was that I kept the litter box outside and when it rained, the cat litter became a sloshy mess.  When I saw that this dog litter had come out, I switched in the hope that my dog would be able use it even when it rained (especially during the rainly months -- when you might have a light rain every day or other day).  This stuff is pretty good with the rain.  In a light rain it will dry up with out much of a problem in the sun.  In a heavier rain, the pellets absorb the water and become larger then usual but they do not create a sloshy mess.  So my dog can use the box during or after the rain and then it is not so hard to clean out and replace the litter.  I only have 3 comments with respect to this litter other than the foregoing: (1) the pellets, in my opinion, are probably a bit too large for dogs with small feet, (I would suggest that they be made smaller or at least more narrow -- it took my dog a while to get use to this), (2) cat litter that clumps really make it much easier to keep the rest of the litter completely clean (although this is not so bad but you end up using more litter because you have to scoop a lot out to make sure that you get all of the waste matter and liquid, and (3) because this does not have clumping properties you probably have to replace this more often because it tends to smell bad more quickly then kitty litter (about once a week).  Otherwise, I think this is a pretty good product.  I would definitely recommend it for indoor or outdoor use.

review/summary: never used anything else
review/text: I bought this nine years ago when I first got my baby before I knew if she would be prone to shredding or otherwise destroying puppy pads or some other "potty" option and have used it ever since - in three residences in two states.  My dog is not a shredder or destructive in any way, so if there is any way to make a mess of this, I haven't seen it and can't imagine what it would be.  When new, I put her in it every morning (she was too little to crawl in by herself) and she learned very quickly.  It works great and no visitor has ever admitted to being able to smell anything from it, (if it is freshly wet and you are standing right over it, you pick up a bit of an ammonia smell, but that's it) so I think I would've been told by now if that were an issue.  The "pellets" are about the circumference of a pencil and the slotted scoops work just fine.  You don't have to be relentless about scooping every time it is used.  The only possible downside is that a bag of it is heavy.  My little one is accustomed to "going" outside if she is staying somewhere that doesn't have a box, so don't let thinking you have to use this exclusively deter you from giving it a shot.  We walk outside just for exercise and socialization, which is especially nice if it is snowy or raining.

review/summary: Second Nature Dog Litter
review/text: I started using Purina Second Nature dog litter one day after I brought my puppy home from the breeder at 8 weeks old.  Within 3 days he was trained to use the litter box.  I thought this product was a bit expensive for litter.  But I soon found out that it was worth it.  I used various cheaper brands over a period of a few months in order to save money.  Found that they weren't as absorbent and untrackable.  But most important of all was the odor.  THERE WAS NONE.  Some that I tried actually stunk out the house and had to be thrown away immediately. I refuse to use anything other than Second Nature because I'm satisfied with the results.

The price on Amazon is the same or maybe a little more than the pet store but the shipping was free (when I bought a bunch of items) and saved me the hectic trip to the pet store.  Plus the bag is heavy, it was worth getting.  In terms of the "quality"...  I have been using Purina's brand for 5 years.  They are the only real competitors who make/sell dog litter.  My dog hates cat litter.  The only complaint I would have is that over the years, the size of the pellets gets smaller which makes the litter not last as long.  I liked it when the pellets were bigger, but maybe it's better for smaller dogs??

review/text: My dogs will not go out in the rain so they use the litter box.  I tried using other less expensive litter, including cat litters, but my girls said "NO".  This is a great dog litter and my girls love it.  It costs much less on Amazon than at PetsMart.

review/summary: Life Saver for rainy days or anyone w/ an injury
review/text: It took a while to train our miniature poodle to use litter because she was first trained on pads. But, she's now 100% litter trained and it's terrific. The trick was to put some litter in the box with a pad on top. Once she got used to that I cut the pads down until they were about 5" x 5". She tried to stand on them, but of course she ended up going in the litter. I still put a tiny piece of pad in the box as a sort of X  marks the spot, but it's rarely soiled. The trick for me was to scoop the poop ASAP because she would not use the box again until it was cleaned. (The litter absorbs and deodorizes urine.) Yes, she's a prissy girl!<br /><br />She also likes to crack the fresh litter like a nut and spit out the pieces. Fine with me, it's easy to pick up. Since my husband developed a hip problem, the litter has been a life saver since he can't walk her as much as she needs and we live on the second floor.<br /><br />This product is perfect for any small dog, especially if trained on it from day one. I notice that some breeders advertise that their dogs are litter trained.

review/summary: Give it a shot
review/text: I normally don't write reviews because I'm busy, lazy, and short on time.<br /><br />I tried this product in a desperate hope of finding a cleaner, no smell alternative to pee pads and the potty patch.<br /><br />I have a 6 month old pomeranian puppy and love her dearly.  When she first came at 2 months, I tried using the "Potty Patch" - the faux grass thing you can buy at Petco.  My brother, who also has a pomeranian, loves the Potty Patch - one key difference - he lives in a house and I live in an apartment.<br /><br />The Potty Patch gets pretty nasty after a few days, no matter how good you are at picking up poop without smearing it.  It also smells after a month, no matter how much you clean it.  Also, living in an apartment, I had no place to clean it outside, so my only options were my shower/bathtub or a sink.  For germ-phobes like myself, these are not options at all (I'm not even that bad of a germ phobe).  There is also the problem of finding a place to "hang" the faux grass so that it dries effectively but doesn't drip all over the floor.  The whole process was not fun at all - carrying the bin to dump the pee, etc. etc.<br /><br />I then tried pee pads, which are much cleaner because like diapers, after use, you throw it out.  However, some cons are that unless your dog pees right in the middle of the pad, some pee seeps onto the floor - leaving you to have to clean constantly.  My dog also refuses to use the pee pad "economically" - that is, if there is a clean spot on the pad which already has been used, she won't go - I have to put a new one down.  This gets costly as my dog pees at least five times a day.  There is also the smell issue - even though I bought the pricier pads.<br /><br />So I tried Purina dog litter.  I couldn't find any dog litter pans (checked internet as well) so I bought a carrier case and used the bottom part as the pan - the carrier case is good because the bottom part has sides and a low entry way for the dog - something cat litter boxes do not have.  At first I only put a little of the litter in the box but my dog would slide all around in it.  I put a lot more (about an inch) and she no longer slid all over (she is 4.2 pounds fyi).  Once she peed a few times, it helped keep the pieces in place better, too - in part because the litter bits get a little bigger with liquid and they get less "shiny" - I think the shine comes from something in the litter bits that helps keep its shape or helps control odor.<br /><br />There is no smell either - so I can leave it for a week and then change the pellets out.  Because its in the pan, no pee on the ground.  A couple of pellets do fall out occasionally when my dog exists the pan, but it's not a big deal.  My dog is still not trained to go poop in it, so I don't have any first hand knowledge of how that works, but I imagine it shouldn't be a problem and I will get a scooper to scoop those sections out.<br /><br />I think one of the cons is that the bag is kind of big (for an apartment) and dogs may take some time getting used to it (they may not be used to stepping onto a non-smooth surface).  However, I am a fan and will continue to use it.

review/text: Good Health Half Naked Popcorn (HNP) has a soft flavor without the harshness of salt and butter.  It does not make me thirsty like other commercial popcorn.  Yet, it satisfies my desire for popcorn.  Chips and dip taste great but adds pounds, HNP help keep the pounds off while the tummy gets full.<br /><br />I like the price of a box and often order them two at a time.  They store well and after 100 or so bags I have only found good popcorn.

review/summary: The only pre-popped popcorn I've liked
review/text: I'm not a big fan of bags of popped popcorn but got this on sale at Whole Foods because the "hint of olive oil" appealed to me. This popcorn tastes unusually fresh for pre-popped popcorn. I can just barely taste the olive oil (which I like) and the salt level is great. There's just enough salt that I don't feel like it's "missing" but much less than any other packaged snack foods I've tried (aside from unsalted versions, which usually are too flavorless for me to enjoy.) I'll definitely start buying this regularly.

I am also really happy with the light and fluffy texture.  The flavor is very subtle, which is perfect for making caramel corn or adding your own seasonings.  At first I thought the popcorn had no flavor of its own; but the more of it I eat, the more I appreciate it plain.

review/text: This is significantly healthier than processed sugars, and even artificial sweeteners (many of which are carcinogenic). I use either this or honey in cooking where regular sugar is called for, or in beverages such as tea.<br /><br />The granular form in this packaging is chemically identical to the block form called panela that is popular in Central and South America (and called Jaggery in India and other Asian countries), such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005F5K5N2">Goya Panela Brown Sugar Cane 1 Lb - Redonda</a>.  The ley difference is the form - the panela is a block that must be grated or shaved to obtain a serving, while this form is conveniently ready to use as is.<br /><br />If you consume processed sugars or artificial sweeteners, consider this (or panela) as healthier alternatives. I will not use any other type of sweetener except honey.

review/summary: Perfect for Dark Chocolate Lovers!
review/text: I found this cocoa at Whole Foods and thought it was expensive, but I splurged and bought it. I had never heard of cocoa with pieces of dark chocolate in it. I like to make mine with whole milk or 2%. I do have to add sugar because it is too bitter for me without. Having to add sugar doesn't bother me much because I keep lots of different sugars in the pantry and I like being able to customize a little. Sometimes I use a dark muscavado sugar or coconut palm sugar. I do have to keep stirring my cocoa before I drink it because if not the dark chocolate bits drift to the bottom of my cup. Then I end up with chocolate sludge when I am done. Another reviewer mentioned heating the milk appropriately solves that problem. However I am not sure I want those tasty bits melted completely as I like the bursts of bitter chocolate they add to the my sweet cocoa.<br /><br />I should say that my roommate also loves this cocoa and would rate it 5 stars too, but she is not the review writing type. She also like her coffee without sugar and prefers this cocoa without sugar too. She prefers to use fat free or 1% milk.<br /><br />I later found it a couple bucks cheaper at Sprouts and even cheaper yet on Amazon if I am willing to buy 3. I can't help but wonder if regular cocoa powder and a little shaved dark chocolate might perform the same though. It would be loads cheaper too.

I make it with milk, and it seems that to get it perfect you must heat the milk adequately to melt all the chocolate pieces (after all it is the chocolate pieces that make this a drinking chocolate not your average cocoa). Compared to ghiradelli cocoas, this wins both in price and quality. Miles better than Swiss Miss.

review/summary: Dagoba's nutritional label is fraudulent
review/text: I have to agree with others that the flavor of this product is superior, especially their Xocolatl variety (with chili and cinnamon in the mix).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the manufacturer has provided grossly misleading information on their web site and on the product packaging. Both claim that a tablespoon of the product weighs 5 grams. However, in truth a loose, level tablespoon of the product actually weighs about 10 grams.<br /><br />The packaging lists the serving size as 4 tablespoons, and explicitly states the total number of servings per container as 17, while their web site lists a serving size as 3 tablespoons, which implies a total of at least 22 servings per 340g container.<br /><br />In fact, the actual number of servings per container is half what the manufacturer claims. A 340g container of mix is sufficient for 8 cups of drink prepared according to the instructions on the packaging.<br /><br />Far be it from me to tell someone else they shouldn't pay $1+ per serving of hot chocolate mix. If a person feels it's worth it, more power to them. But they should at least be aware that they are doing so, which they won't if they believe this product's packaging.<br /><br />Caveat emptor!

review/text: This is a great product, but it is difficult to find in local stores.  It is not carried by many merchants.  This natural product does help with digestion.

review/summary: NOT metallic
review/text: There is nothing metallic about this color. It is gold in the fact that it is yellow, but that is it. There isn't any sheen or sparkle. I was bummed.

review/summary: Lovely color, great to work with
review/text: The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for "highlighting" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.

review/summary: Is this a joke? If I could give it a 0, I would.
review/text: First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure!

review/summary: Best Decaf Ever!
review/text: I can find this at a grocery store near my home but I am happy that Amazon now stocks it because it is somewhat inconvenient to run to the grocery store every week or so when I need a new can.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the BEST decaf espresso coffee I've ever had. (Outside of Italy, of course.)  It is much better than brands such as Lavazza because it has a very robust flavor. Very coffee-like and I have a hard time believing it is decaf. There aren't many decaf espressos out there to choose from.<br /><br />It is a fine grind and it makes wonderful espresso and cappuccino in my DeLonghi EC155. I only buy/use/drink Italian coffee.<br /><br />You won't be sorry you purchased this!

review/text: I am so glad that Amazon carries DELALLO decaffeniated coffee, because our local grocery store quit caring the decaf one, only the regular.  With everyone being so conscious about health and him being a heart patient, he needs the decaffeinated one.  He loves it.  THANK YOU!!!

review/summary: A blended coffee?
review/text: I prefer Arabica beans, no blends.  The information on the can says this is a blend--which suggests it contains several different beans.  Once brewed, there is a bit of sludgy taste to the coffee.  I will no longer shop around;  my first experience with home-brewed espresso was Lavazzo. The label clearly states it is Arabica coffee and there is a clean taste to the espresso.

review/summary: Too Big
review/text: I didn't have a problem with the smell or the edges of these treats. I had a problem with the size. I thought they were entirely too big to be considered training treats. You need to have a big dog to use these treats for training. I have a maltipoo and peekapoo and these treats take them at least a minute to eat. By the time they finish the treat they've forgotten what they were praised for.

review/summary: Not a Representative Sumatran Coffee
review/text: I purchased this thinking it might be a replacement for the FIrst Colony Sumatran which is currently unavailable.  Pretty disappointing in the flavor department; it has a flavor mildly reminiscent of Folgers - not as bad as Folgers, but not representative of a good Sumantran.

I used to get it all the time at Von's.  I found another brand the other day, which wasn't nearly as good.  'Caused me to use the internet, and see if I couldn't find the "Real McCoy";)

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I discovered this product while vacationing in Switzerland and have been addicted every since.  Unfortunately, stores rarely sell Toblerone at all and when they do, it is only the milk or dark chocolates.  The white has the smooth and creamy taste that is the best treat around.  All too often it seems Amazon is out of the white along with other on line vendors so when I see it, I stock up. I recommend you do the same.<br />Delicious!

review/summary: Tetley changed this tea
review/text: I used to only buy this tea. Lipton and the regular Tetley did not have the bold flavor like the British teas. Maybe 6-8 months ago??- they changed the formula or the way they make this tea. It tastes as bland as the Lipton tea. Cannot recommend-You are not paying a little more for "British tea". Trying even two tea bags in one cup does not make it the bold flavor like it was before. Simply pathetic- they ruined this tea.
