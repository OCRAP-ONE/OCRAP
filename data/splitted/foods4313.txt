review/summary: Terrific chip!
review/text: Be warned, the BBQ flavor is terribly addicting. In fact, I'm eating some right now. Local prices hovered around $4.50 a bag (!!!!!) so I ordered them off Amazon for a great price. If only Amazon would ship them one by one a few days apart so I won't eat 4 bags in one sitting.... ;] Go ahead and try them, you won't regret it.

review/text: For someone who is allergic to corn, soy and wheat the Original Pop Chips are a must have for the pantry. I can finally have nachos! I think they taste much better than the traditional "chips". My family finally tried them (most foods I can eat don't taste this good!) and now they are hooked too. These chips are like gold in our house!!

review/summary: Fantastic Crispy Airy Chips
review/text: Somewhere between a rice cake and a potato chip in texture, PopChips are an excellent low calorie snacking choice. I've tried all of the available flavors and here is my assessment of each:<br />Barbeque - A little too sweet for my taste but not bad overall<br />Jalapeno - High on Spice, not too salty, not much other flavor. I guess I was hoping for a cheesy jalapeno.<br />Original - Not super flavorful but great for dipping<br />Cheddar - Yummy<br />Parmesan Garlic - So Garlicky. Good but make for stinky breath<br />Salt & Pepper - Good<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - If you like Vinegar you might like these but I wasn't as big of a fan of them as I expected<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Hands down the BEST flavor

review/summary: Life-saver for chip lovers trying to eat healthier
review/text: I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.

review/text: When PopChips were really hard to find, I was ordering them by the case from Amazon on a regular basis.  The price was always great and these really are my go-to snack.  They are always fresh and delicious from Amazon.<br /><br />I definitely prefer Original over barbecue and sour cream & onion.  I haven't tried other flavors, but Original works just fine for me because I use it for various dips and will even use dry seasonings on them if I'm in the mood.<br /><br />I don't know anybody that I've offered some of these to who didn't want a bag of their own!  Highly recommended.

review/text: This honey was quite unlike anything I had experienced before. The flavor had a pervasive bitterness to it, unlike any clover honey I had tasted in the past, and I could only describe it reminiscent of extremely over-brewed tea. It made me cringe. Its odor also had a certain disagreeability about it; there was sweetness, yes, but it was accompanied by a faint chemical smell like that of petroleum.<br /><br />Pieces of honeycomb could be seen suspended throughout the honey, which I suppose at least tells you it is authentic, but they are not very pleasant to bite into... like a sticky yet dry piece of shoe leather---impossible to chew through.<br /><br />Avoid this product.

review/text: I usually cover books, DVd and CDs on Amazon but this is an exception. I fell into this product by accidcent and decided to try it. I usually don't like mixes like this because you then need to buy an addition 10 or 15 ingredients and the "seasoning packet" usually says "other spices" so you don't know what is in it. This product is different. I bought a 3 lb pork roast, put in the slow cooker added one can of diced tomatoes, chicken broth from a boullion cube and a smal can of tomato sauce. Turned it on and left it for 7 hours on high. When It was done, all I had to do was pull the pork apart and eat it. We got about 10 large servings from it.<br /><br />Unfortunately it is out of stock on Amazon but I do highly recommend it.<br /><br />Steve Ramm

review/text: I really like this oil. It is rather green in color and I use it a lot to roast vegetables, stir-fry, on salads and in particular potato salads. It is neutral tasting, but has a very pleasant mouth feel and adds a slight umami flavor to food. My favorite application is drizzled on boiled potatoes with salt. I have tried other brands of grapeseed oil and none had this pleasant green color or taste. That said, I get it for about 9-10 dollars a bottle locally, so it is relatively expensive here on Amazon.

review/summary: Just when I thought it couldn't get any better than Caribou's signature blend, along comes Daybreak!
review/text: When I picked up a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, I really thought I'd found the best good-cuppa-coffee to please everyone in our household. Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee. With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.<br /><br />I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings. I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!<br /><br />I enjoy a medium roast with a kick. Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma. And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments. This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop. It goes great with a little skim milk, too. A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us. So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly). Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it. It's my new go-to k cup!

Trident Wild Blueberry Twist is simply and pleasantly fruity, with a wonderful blueberry-pomegranate flavor that lasts a very long time. Nothing fancy or extreme about it.

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>Pirate's booty is a light and crunchy snack with no added MSG. It comes in several sizes from lunch box to large family size. The large 10 oz bag has a "zipper lock" so it stays fresh for a long time. The taste intensifies as you eat it, becoming cheesier and cheesier.

review/text: Bought these to bring to the office in my lunch.  They taste great and good portion size.  I could eat more of them since they taste so good but I find myself satisfied with the .5 serving and don't feel cheated at all.  I attached a photo of the contents of the .5 oz size bag dumped onto a napkin with a pen for size reference.  I will continue to buy these as they are a healthy snack that tastes great.<br /><br />Ingredients listed:<br />Corn Meal, Contains one or more of the following: Sunflower, Expeller Pressed Canola or Corn Oil, Aged Cheddar Cheese (Cultured Milk, Salt, Enzymes), Whey and Buttermilk.

review/text: I am really happy with this product.  The Pirate's Booty Aged White Cheddar are a tasty snack, but the best thing is the half ounce bags.  This equates to one Points Plus on the Weight Watcher plan and really just the right amount to make one feel satisfied.  I shared them with friends, and they were thrilled that they taste like other cheesy puffed snacks, but without the orange fingers.  We will definitely be sneaking these bags into the movie theatre.

review/text: I love Pirate's Booty- they are like little cheesy puffs of happiness, without the neon-orange-greasy-dustiness of anything with the word "Cheez" in the name. They are a bit more *tangy* than the average "cheez puff", so if you have a sensitive palette, be warned that it's a slightly different flavor.<br /><br />These little tiny bags are PERFECT for a snack on the go or a kid's lunch. My daughter is sort of a small eater and the bag is just the right size for her, and it's also just the right size for me and my husband- we can grab one and eat the entire thing without feeling like we need to skip a meal in exchange. It's like non-guilt happiness in a tiny bag.

review/summary: Perfect portion size for little pirates
review/text: What is not to love about Pirate's Booty?  It's cheesy and delicious.  It is one of the first foods we used for snacks for toddlers and beginning eaters because while it is similar to cheese popcorn, it dissolves easily when chewed, making it much less of a choking hazard.  At the store, generally you can only find really large bags of this though and we could never finish one before the bag got stale.  While the half ounce bags are not the most cost effective, I would much rather pay a little more and be certain we will consume 100% of the product versus throwing half a bag away every time.  The amount in these bags is more than adequate for a single serving, especially for a child--great alternative to chips for school lunches!  And at only 65 calories per bag, you can enjoy one too!  Bags are the size of the type you would typically buy for school lunches and have always arrived in great condition.  Amazon typically puts the PB box inside of another one for shipping, but even occasionally when they have simply arrived in the manufacturer's box (which is quite sturdy) we have never had any damaged product, and we have been ordering these for years.

I have never allowed anyone in the family to mindlessly eat snacks out of a bag, and products like these are lifesavers.<br /><br />The flavor is waaaaay better than Cheetos. More subtle, and a lot less sodium. Also a great portion size/calorie count for a snack on most diet plans. I bought mine in May and they are dated for mid-October, so I have no complaints about freshness. This is a five star product.

Love the aged cheddar, I have tried the others, they are good but this is just exceptional. Now if you can self discipline to just one bag then you should be safe.. enjoy!

review/summary: For Those Who Can't Have Popcorn
review/text: I first encountered this product at COSTCO.  When they discontinued it (reason unknown) I decided to find a way to buy some on my own.  I can no longer eat popcorn.  I have diverticulosis and the doctor says eating popcorn is about like eating fishhooks - very bad news!  I can have this as a substitute.  I am also diabetic and there is no sugar in the product and the carbohydrates are not very high either.  I can watch a movie and have something to munch on.  I thought it was a bit much to have to order so many bags at a time, but in retrospect it isn't.  I thought it would be about a 6 months supply.  (I didn't count on my wife and son acquiring a taste for it as well.)  It turned out to last about three months.  While other flavors are offered, I think the cheddar cheese flavor best simulates buttered popcorn.  (Actually, I bought the 4 oz size.)

review/text: I am one of those people who when they get a bad cold it eventually settles into the chest in a very bad way (family genes) and each time it takes longer and longer to really lose the cough and congestion. Last weekend the latest cold making the rounds hit me and head sorely congested I spotted this on the grocery shelves and decided to give it a shot. While it isn't the greatest tasting tea ever, my head did clear up enough so that I passed on the cold medicine for the night, and the cold had pretty much cleared up the next morning, and virtually no chest congestion at all.

review/summary: My Year-round Go-To Tea for Colds and Flu
review/text: I have been purchasing this tea for cold and flu season for as long as it has been available in my area. Initially, I was purchasing it from my local natural foods supermarket but recently began getting it through the Amazon Subscribe and Save program which makes it a set it and forget it item on my shopping list.<br /><br />If you have studied herbs with immune boosting properties, many of the ingredients will be familiar. Ginger root is good for the digestive system and also boosts the immune system. Licorice root, cinammon and cardamom are used Ayurvedic medicine for balancing and toning as well as for colds and flu. Eucalyptus opens up breathing and airways. More than a few of the herbs are considered warming and tonifying, something symptom suppressants just don't do.<br /><br />For maximum benefit, the tea bags should be steeped in hot water for a few minutes. I have a friend who reuses tea bags because the tea is not inexpensive but it's better to drink the tea after a good soak. Honey helps round it out if you have a bit of phlegm.<br /><br />I try to keep at least a box on hand since colds seem to be year-round lately. Another tea I keep on hand is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001VVPJS">Yogi Tea Throat Comfort -- 16 Tea Bags</a> which works great too.

review/summary: Tastes a little strange, but works well!
review/text: I don't get sick very often, but when I do it's usually the sore throat/runny nose variety. This tea helps my throat feel much much better. It's soothing to my stomach as well as warming, without making me overheat.<br />This helps my body get all the mucous that otherwise would just be collecting in my throat, out, so that it doesn't breed infection. Gross, but better than the alternative!<br />The taste of the tea is weird. It smells like cough syrup, and even though basil and black pepper aren't the main two ingredients, they are mainly what I taste.<br />Usually I have one cup of "normal" tea standing by so that I can alternate if needed.<br />It depends on your taste buds as to what flavors you will find stand out the most.<br />Definitely get the sampler if you are unsure if you'll like this one, because then at least you won't get stuck with an entire box. Throat Coat tea is a good alternative. Both teas work the same, this one just tastes like black pepper instead of licorice.

review/summary: light healing tea
review/text: Usually I don't like strong herbal teas like Celestial Seasoning, but when I've got a cold, this tea hits the spot.  It has a strong aromatic fragrance from the licorice and it tastes pretty sharp and stinging from the black pepper and ginger but that just tells me it's working well and working on my body to help soothe and heal it.  I've given it to friends when they have colds and it's not a miracle cure tea but definitely a light healer for them in addition to their regular medicines.  I usually add my favorite tea (rooibos) into it which seems to make it taste a lot better and make me less stressed, less anxious, more awakened, and more relaxed.  I'll also add lemon and when it cools to lukewarm (heat kills the honey's enzymes), I'll add organic raw honey for even more healthful healing benefits.

review/summary: Intense taste with intense results
review/text: I won't lie; the taste of the tea was a lot to get over. I'm not big on herbal teas and this was a doosey. It's quite peppery and strong, adding sweetener will not help you. But after the first few bags it grew on me. I suggest drinking it HOT! When it cools the flavor seems to be much stronger.<br />That being said, if you can handle the intensity of it you will reap the benefits 10 fold. Any time I feel like I'm getting a chest bug I run to the store for this tea. I drink 3-5 cups of it every day until the symptoms subside. (Usually only 3 or 4 days or 1 box's worth). I swear by this stuff. I have not gotten a full-blown chest cold in years and I think it's thanks to Yogi Cold Season tea! This is the only herbal remedy that has 100% worked and convinced me it's a better alternative than the medicine isle.

I've handed it out to friends and neighbors and they report the same success. In the winter, I buy a case of it. Of course, the taste is a bit unusual and peppery, an acquired taste to be sure. You might want to add honey.

review/summary: Great for early morning congestion!
review/text: I love this product!  I have seasonal allergies and do not want to take regular medication and was looking for an alternative when I found this tea one day at my local grocer.  I brew two bags of this tea in 24 ounces of water in my insulated cup and drink it on the way to work and into the morning.  My sinuses feel better and my congestion is much less noticeable.  The price for this tea on Amazon was about 2/3 of the price in the store and with the auto ship program, I don't ever have to worry about ordering it again because it gets delivered automatically.

review/summary: Very unique flavor
review/text: I bought this tea without looking at the ingredients. I got home, made a cup, and couldn't believe how pungent the scent was. I took a sip, and found it quite tasty, but really unique. After reading through the ingredients, I probably found it unique because of the pepper, cardamom, oregano, and basil in this tea. Probably the first time I've had these in a tea!<br /><br />That being said, it's tasty and soothing. I have chronic allergy/sinus issues so I wasn't expecting it to be a cure for any of them, but it is soothing and makes me feel a little better.

review/text: I found this product in the grocery store and tried it---cleared up my congestion and chest.  The combination of herbs keeps you clear.  I went back to the store where I bought it and of course, they don't have it anymore, so my next step was amazon.com (they have everything).  It was the same cost as the grocery store, free shipping and now I don't have to worry about the local store having it in stock.  This product really works and with cold/flu season here, I use it every morning!!!!  Please check with a doctor if you are on any meds before consuming due to the herbs.  I love this product and will continue to use it as long as it is available!!!

review/summary: Green hope - - - Truvia sweetener
review/text: Truvia tastes more like sugar than the blue, pink, and yellow packets; and it does not leave an aftertaste.  In some, excessive Truvia intake can cause digestive distress; but this has not been my experience to date.<br /><br />1) The blue packet turns into formaldehyde at 86 degrees.<br /><br />2) The yellow packet claims to be made from sugar - - - but - - - it involves a five-step process that substitutes three chlorine atoms for three hydroxyl groups - - - and it breaks down into chlorine when digested.<br /><br />3) The pink packet was delisted as a carcinogen, but it is made from an organic molecule out of petroleum.<br /><br />4) Truvia is made by steeping (like tea) the leaves of the stevia (an herbal shrub) to extract steviol glycoside rebaudioside.  This is combined with a sugar alcohol (made by fermenting glucose {simple sugar} with yeast).<br /><br />To sweeten my grapefruit, my choices are products that are basically:<br /><br />1) formaldehyde<br />2) chlorine<br />3) petroleum<br />4) leaf extract, simple sugar, and yeast<br />5) refined sugar<br /><br />Formaldehyde and chlorine give me migraines.  Petroleum is a nonstarter for me, and refined sugar has the most calories - - - which I do not need.  The phrase "all natural" doesn't impress me because snake venom is "all natural"; but all things considered, I'll take number four.<br /><br />I'm also looking forward to trying Sprite Green and Odwalla Reduced Calorie Quenchers (with Truvia), all the while hoping that Classic Coca Cola Green will follow.

review/summary: Excellent alternative to chemical sugar substitutes
review/text: I was hesitant to try any stevia product after reading some reviews stating the reviewer had experienced either a bitter taste or an unpleasant after taste.  I'm pleased to report I've had neither of these negative results.  Truvia, to me, tastes very much like sugar, and as packaged by this maker, has a consistency and texture very similar to sugar.  No aftertaste.  Works great in coffee.  I'm sending all of my leftover Splenda to a friend who still uses it.  I haven't used aspertame for over a year due to its dangers.  I'm very pleased to have found a wonderful and more healthful alternative to Splenda, as well.

review/summary: Better taste than stevia and better for you than sugar
review/text: Recently we've decided to cut down on our sugar intake. So at a Whole Foods we picked up both a box of a stevia packet sweetener and a box Truvia packets. The stevia packets gave our tea a bitter, diet-tea taste.  It dissolves quickly but has a very weird taste to it.  So we tried the Truvia next time and it was great.  It tastes just like sugar.  It has no bitter or odd tastes or aftertastes.  It takes a minute or two longer than stevia to dissolve but we noticed that even while it was still disappearing from our glasses the tea already tasted sweet and not grainy.  I'll be ordering much more from Amazon since I can't pick this up at any of my local stores yet.

review/summary: Quick and Tasty Noodles
review/text: While I wouldn't call them nutritious, these noodles are very tasty and take almost no time to prepare, making them a perfect last minute lunch when combined with some veggies. This product happens to be vegan and gluten free, which is great for those who avoid animal products and/or gluten! The sauce is delicious and more than enough for the amount of noodles so you can either stir in some extras (I like peas with this) or some additional rice noodles; I add about 1/4 to 1/3 more rice noodles from a separate package to compensate for the extra sauce. Everyone in my family enjoys these!<br /><br />NOTE: I noticed that the ingredients listed on Amazon differ from those on the packages I have. Amazon's ingredient list includes soy and the list on mine does not. I am not sure why that is but I guess the ingredients in this may have changed or will change?

If this were churned it would become butter, but butter it is not. It is the most wonderful thick snow white cream in the world. Emjoy it on toast with jam or put it in an Italian dish instead of cottage cheese. Because there is NO SALT in this product after opening it will have a shelf life of about 5 days. Delicious!

I was excited to receive my shipment of 4 bottles of Double Devon Cream, but upon opening the box I discovered the cream had become liquid in transit.

Have ordered the same product from other vendors without this result, so I'm not sure what the problem was. Perhaps better packaging is needed when shipping to warm-weather locations like Southern Alabama...

review/summary: Uncertain Function
review/text: This product comes with minimal instruction, rather like soap. With soap, however, we all have some routine experience and know how much to use, how hard to scrub, and what the expected results are. I tried placing a few drops of this product in my hair after shampoo and conditioner, while my hair was still wet. The results were mixed once my hair had dried. On the down side, my hair continued to have an oily appearance as if it was still moist long after it had dried. While some may find this always-wet look attractive, I don't. On the up side, my scalp appreciated the therapy since my skin is often too dry. Further, there are no difficulties with occasional flyaway hair. It's almost as if I've used hair spray. However, I suspect I'd have the same results with some far less expensive (per ounce) grapeseed oil and there's nothing here to tell me otherwise. Perhaps I should be mixing this with another agent and misting it onto my hair as other reviewers have suggested, or using more, or using less. Perhaps those with long hair would observe a reduction in split end frequency. Again, these issues are uncertain given the absence of more information as to what exactly this product is designed to achieve.

review/summary: Use in moderation
review/text: I exercise regularly.  During summer, scalp can easily dry out after extensive sweating.  I always like to give my hair and scalp extra treatment.  For one, I dye my hair and since I wash it every day, I like to give it extra moisture whenever possible.  The latest rave for hair care is argan oil.  This product contains argan in addition to many other minerals and oils.  Instructions for the product indicate that this hair oil is helpful to soothe hair and it can be used on both wet and dry hair.<br /><br />I used this oil on my wet hair.  I left it on my hair overnight.  In the morning, my hair had "wet" look.  My advice is if you are planning to leave this product in your wet hair overnight, you may consider washing it again in the morning.  For that reason, I would use this product on the weekend as extra care for hair and scalp.  If you intend to use this product on a dry hair, use just a little bit of it to smoothe hair after using hair dryer,  It will nourish the ends and smooth frizzy hair.  This is very helpful if you live in a humid climate.<br /><br />Bottle is fairly small, 3 oz size.  For that reason, it is also convenient for travel.  One can pack it easily if one goes on vacation.  If you are swimming in the ocean, pool or just spendign a lot of time in the sun without covering your hair and scalp, this product is perfect for a little extra care.

review/summary: A little dab will do ya
review/text: I tried the Moisturizing Shampoo and Root Boosting Conditioner and was not impressed with either product.  In fact, after a few washes I noticed the ends of my hair felt much dryer.  So, I decided to add this Shea oil to see if I could replenish some of the moisture in my ends.  This product did make a difference after just one use. Just remember that a little goes a long way.  I found that rubbing it into my scalp just made my roots look greasy so now I concentrate on my ends then finish off by rubbing my hands through the rest of my hair.  It also gives my blonde hair a big shine boost.<br /><br />While, I won't be buying the Moisturizing shampoo and conditioner in the future I might buy this again.  It works very much like the Moroccan Argan oil that I use but I don't have to go to a specialty store to get it.

review/summary: I Like the Scent
review/text: The first ingredient is mineral oil, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  The mineral oil used in cosmetics is regulated by the USFDA and is highly refined and purified.  It's an ingredient that has been used in cosmetics for over 100 years.  I don't know exactly how much mineral oil is in this product in relation to the other oil ingredients (coconut, palm, wheat germ, almond, sunflower, soybean, and spinosa kernel), but I imagine it might be as high as 51%.  Shea butter is around the 6th ingredient listed, if I counted correctly. Any quality oil will help moisturize your hair or skin whether it's mineral oil or pure Shea butter.  They basically perform the same function which to serve as a barrier between your skin or hair to prevent water from naturally leaving, thus drying out.<br /><br />What I can't figure out is how best to use this oil.  Since it came with no directions I tried rubbing a small amount into my palms then into my hair, especially the ends, after shampooing and before blow-drying, but the result was that my hair was oily and stiff. I had to rewash my hair to get the oil out of it.  I think maybe applying it before bed to dry hair and let it moisturize over night???<br /><br />The shape of this bottle is just right to hold in one hand while squeezing out a few drops of oil into the other.  I have rubbed it on dry areas of my skin with good results, so if I can't use it in my hair it will still smooth out some rough spots on my skin. I am usually very particular about scents and can't wear any perfumes, but I rather like the scent of this product.
