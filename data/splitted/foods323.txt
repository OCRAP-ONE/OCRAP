review/summary: Black Cherry
review/text: Black cherry is one of my favorite flavors and scents.  I love tea, so put the two together, and the result is outstanding.<br /><br />This tea has a dry, bitter (in a good way) cherry flavor, but also sweet and a hint of berries.  The flavor is perfect.<br /><br />This herbal tea has no caffiene.  I don't even bother to boil it; I simply put it in my water bottle with water, and then put the bottle in the freezer, and in not too long, I have cold, refreshing tea.<br /><br />Black cherry brings back childhood memories.  It has always been one of my favorite flavor/scents.  It is one of those flavors/scents that reminds me of the smell of wood and Grandpa's house.

review/summary: Iced tea - iced childhood memories!
review/text: I LOVE this tea! When I first tried it, I mixed it in my regular blend of white, green, black and some kind of flavored herbal tea and brewed it for iced tea....hated it!! eeewwww! (love berry zinger and mandarin orange etc) ...however I thought I'd take a box down to my mother-in-law and see if she enjoyed it ...stuck with nothing to drink I took a few bags and threw it in my 32 ounce travel mug and let it sit at room temperature till I remembered it...sweetened it with a bit of sweet-n-low and FELL IN LOVE!! I felt like a kid again enjoying my icey cold Choo Choo Cherry (boy, does that date me) on the back porch! It's cherry without the cough syrup back taste - I have no idea how it tastes brewed as hot tea, but throw this in a pitcher of water (1 bag per 8oz) leave it in the fridge over night and you will have a delicious iced beverage! (I leave the tea bags in till it's gone, the flavor just gets more intense)...love it- just ordered six more boxes! woo hoo!! I do the same thing with the True Blueberry - since they left me without the cold brew Blueberry Tea ...oh the humanity - bring it back, Celestial Seasonings!

review/summary: Chocolate covered raisins.  Five pounds.  What else to say?
review/text: These should be called chocolate chocolate covered raisins because there's so much chocolate!  Aside from issues with the seller's shipping policy (they only ship on Mondays and Tuesdays and ONLY after you reply to their e-mail warning of melted product), I am satisfied with my order.  Nothing spectacular beyond the amount of chocolate - they taste just as you would expect.  Would I pay $45 again for chocolate covered raisins?  Perhaps not, but it was an interesting experiment.  See my submitted photos for packaging/product details.

review/summary: For Chocolate Lovers
review/text: This one is for "Chocolate Lovers" only. if you're familiar with the movie concession standard, "Raisinettes," then you'll know what the 'normal' chocolate covered raisin looks like. Well, these do not fit that profile. There is so much chocolate covering the raisin that there are no discernible wrinkles to be seen. This is on top of the fact that they were double the size of what I normally view a chocolate covered raisin. Truth be told, when I first looked at the bag, I thought I had received chocolate covered peanuts or something. The label readily allayed that fear.<br />Nonetheless, I was still skeptical and had thoughts of giant raisins inside a thick coating of chocolate. Well, the raisins seem to of normal stature after comparing one sans chocolate. But the chocolate coating was definitely thick. Therefore, if you like chocolate with a little raisin mixed in, you'll love this Koppers product (that's me). If you would prefer a little chocolate with your raisin, maybe the Sunmaid brand would be more suitable.<br />I purchased the Sunmaid product and liked it as well. Packaging is a little nicer compared to Koppers' plastic bag. However, it does make a lot of noise during shipping. It was on sale at Amazon for $16.95 (51oz) and made comparable to this 5lb bag at $26.75. At Sunmaid's regular price of $21.26, Koppers is a much better deal.

review/summary: Cat loves it!
review/text: When I adopted my cat they were feeding her science diet cat food. I kept her on that for only about 2 more weeks after before she was starting to refuse to eat the food and would go for my other cat's food that wasn't science diet. So I switched her to that and she ate that for awhile before getting fussy again and not wanting to eat that either. After trying out a few other foods I saw this food at our local animal store and decided to try it out. That was about a year ago now and so far I haven't had a single problem with this food. Both my cats love it and seem to like this food a lot better than the canned food even. The Royal Canin food overall might be a bit more pricey than others, but I'd say it is worth it if you have a picky cat like me.

review/summary: Great food for my cats
review/text: My Persian cat, who suffers from polycystic kidney disease, needs low protein food. He did not like the low protein veterinary diet and it is impossible to segregate his food from the rest of our cats anyway. I bought this food because the protein content is much lower than most foods but is still appropriate for all cats. I have to say that all of our cats love it and are maintaining excellent health on it. This is very expensive food, but the results make it all worth it.

But both our (now 1.5-year-old) cats still love the food, and my vet friend says Royal Canin is one of the best in terms of nutrition. So if you've got the financial flexibility to splurge a bit on your pet's food, this is the stuff to get.

Aside from that, a cat who has NEVER had stomach problems has been experiencing diarrhea and vomiting in the last week. His poop smells WORSE and he hasn't had a solid poop in 2 weeks either. This food has truly been an awful experience and I will not be buying anymore.

review/text: Callard & Bowser, an English confection company, used to make small licorice toffee candies that were just magnificent. They were about an inch in size, and a dark green-black color. Sometimes they'd be loose in a cellophane bag, other times you could find them stacked up, about 12 to a slim box about the size of a large cigarette case, each in a striped silver and black wrapper. I could not get enough of them. Although Callard & Bowser's licorice is long extinct, this is about the closest to the creamy taste of their licorice. Very tasty. I like it a lot. I hope they don't discontinue it. I will be ordering more.

If you want a product that's as close as it gets to Callard and Brower, try Oatfield Irish Licorice Toffee. With Oatfields, while they sometimes can be a little on the hard side, the flavor is dead on.  I just got a 4.4 lb bag of Gustaf's, and will probably give the candy away.  Very disappointed.

review/text: I have to say I am really glad I read the reviews about this licorice.<br />Sandy R hit the taste on the nose. I also remembered the Callard & Bowser English company who sold the best licorice I ever had (at that time). My grandmother introduced it to me. The licorice toffee candies came in a silver box with each piece separately covered with striped silver and black wrapping. It also came with a certificate of quality. I fell in love with the taste instantly and bought it when ever I could. I was heartbroken when I found that Callard & Bowser went out of business. This confection is so similar to the original taste I fell in love with that the after my first piece, I was smiling and almost giddy. I found the best licorice taste again! This is the same original taste I fell in love with and in a softer and freshener candy. I have signed up for the subscription delivery and cannot be more happier. Gustaf's Licorice Caramels are made in Holland and you won't be disappointed. WOW! I am in heaven again.

review/text: Gustaf's Dutch Licorice is an absolute taste treat unparalleled to the taste buds.  If you lice licorice and think that Twizzlers brand is the greatest, when you try Gustaf's you'll think you died and went to heaven.  Gustaf's is a quality licorice made for the discerning taste buds.  No doubt about it, it is one of the best quality licorices available today.  There were brands from the past, namely Callard and Bowser's licorice toffee, that perhaps surpassed this one, but since C&B no longer are in business, Gustaf's is perhaps the best licorice in the world. Yes. it is more expensive, but one pays for quality, and one deserves a real taste treat now and then.<br /><br />If you love the taste of black licorice, do yourself a favor and purchase one bag of these taste bud delights.  You may never want a Twizzler again!<br /><br />kone

review/text: I was really disappointed in these. I was hoping to find a licorice caramel similar in taste to the old Callard & Bowser licorice.  This wasn't it.  There is an odd, almost chemical or salt-like  taste to these as soon as one bites into them, and the texture wasn't quite right, either.  It was a big disappointment.  But happily, I soon discovered Walker's licorice toffees at another website.  No artificial colors or preservatives, and no hydrogenated fats either.  Best of all, they're totally delicious, and by far the closest I've come to that marvelous Callard and Bowser taste and texture.  They're are made in England (like the old Callard &Bowser candies)  and are truly wonderful.  They're irresistible.  I just ordered four more bags!<br />i

review/summary: Not Callard & Bowser
review/text: I bought these after reading the reviews.  Well, if you are expecting Callard & Bowser then these are not going to taste anything like them.  Callard & Bowser had a buttery licorice, these are okay, more of a caramel with a saltier taste.  Stopped my subscription.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: Everybody who knows me knows I like licorice. I prefer salty hard licorice, but these are different. They are caramels with licorice taste. They are chewy, but not like Taffy. It is difficult to describe, but they are more "powdery". You bite through them without much efforts, and don't cause issues for people with braces, dentures etc. Normal caramels can get into all the nooks and crannies but these don't.<br /><br />As for taste, they are true licorice. Sweet licorice. Definitely good. Would buy again. In fact, I subscribe.

I sampled these at a candy shopppe in Old Sacramento, and located them online at Amazon.com<br /><br />They are even better than the (now) defunct Callard & Bowser's brand from England.

review/summary: Very much like Callard & B
review/text: Ive hunted high and low and have tried every type of licorice toffee that I can find since C&B stopped making licorice toffee. Spot on in flavor.  I've read other reviews that outfields or other brands are better.  They are very salty.  If you're a super salty licorice fan, then this is probably not for you. Just the right amount of salt, right amount of sweet.  I've never once written a food review on amazon but I'm doing ths in hopes that this licorice toffee doesn't end up like C&B did and getting discontinued. Keep it coming!  It does come in a large bag, 4 plus pounds, but well worth it.  I've paid 9 to 12 dollars for less than half a pound for stuff that I haven't liked, and occasionally I've seen individual toffees at a gas station from time to time that I've paid 69 cents a piece for. There's got to be at least a hundred plus pieces here.... Plenty to share but I'm ashamed to admit that I've eaten most of the bag myself, but not ashamed to say that I just ordered bag #2.....  Great stuff!

review/summary: A Suitable Substitute for Callard & Bowser's
review/text: For years, maybe as many as 10 I've bemoaned the fact that I couldn't get any Callard & Bowser's Licorice Toffees.  Somehow Amazon's recommendation algorithm knew this and pointed me to these.  I wasn't disappointed.  They have that slight green tint that all the good licorice candies have and lack the bite that those with too much anise have.  Do you remember that cartoon dog who, when he got a biscuit, would hug himself, make noises of ecstasy, jump straight in the air and float down?  I know how that dog felt.  The only down side is that I can't find a local retailer that has smaller quantities available, so I'm going to eat too many too fast.

review/text: First off... it is almost, but not quite up to the Callard & Bowser's version.  C&B's version was\is the gold standard.  These are very good and the ones I've shared among other licorice lovers are very well received.  What is odd is that you really can't eat one, but I am satiated by the second.  So I fully understand reviewers who mention their addictive quality.  In this regard the huge bag is a plus, as folks inevitably return for more.<br /><br />To me, me they are a bit sweeter and softer than the C&B.  They are good enough to remain in the shopping list, however I am continuing my search for the C&B equivalent.<br /><br />Do give them a try though, they really are of high quality.

Although very pleased with the first order of these Dutch candies, the second order arrived and tasted like black Kraft caramels.  They completely lacked the strong, tangy flavor of the first batch.  I don't know what happened, but it definitely was not worth the price of the candy.  If I wanted Kraft caramels, I would have purchased them at a local grocery store.

review/text: I read in one of the older reviews that this licorice reminded them of a Callard and Bowser candy- no longer on the market. The Gustaf's Dutch Licorice Caramel is just like you would think, a chewy licorice, very soft and slightly salty. The old Callard and Bowsers were harder and seemed as though they would like to take the fillings out of your teeth. I like these Gustaf's Licorice caramels, I can see why they go out of stock so often.

review/summary: More caramel than licorice
review/text: I like Gustaf's other licorice, the ones I've posted a review on before.  But these, they are way more caramel-y than they are licorice-y.  You know the caramels (Brach's?) that you can buy in a bag and melt after you've unwrapped each piece to make caramel apples?  These are like those.  They have a grainy, very sugary texture.  Although the licorice flavor is okay, it's clear that this "licorice" is just caramel in disguise.  They seem way more geared to the American palate than to the European taste. (there's no "zout" to these at all.) These Gustaf's licorice caramels are a poor substitute for European "caramel" (toffee).  I won't be buying these again.<br /><br />For a better choice or replacement for the famed Callard & Browser licorice that you might remember, try Walker's NonSuch toffee.  It's awesome, and I wish Amazon currently had it available.  Once you try Walker's licorice toffee, nothing else will do.

review/text: I was recommended this product by a relative of mine, but I must say I didn't feel it was as spectacular as she made it seem. It wasn't overtly chile-ey. Nor was it very Lime-ey. It was just... Meh. To be honest after all the years I've been seasoning my shrimp with some salt, pepper, chili powder & a squeeze of lime it just couldn't compare. I tried using it on some grilled chicken as well but found that, again, there wasn't anything special or really notable about the flavor that made it stand out. I yet again ended up switching back to what I was already using on my chicken- a jalapeno spice mix. I would probably have given this product 2 stars but considering my aunt recommended it I decided to offer 3 as a leeway for all those varying taste buds out there.

review/summary: Great cat food.  It's a keeper!
review/text: All 3 of my cats love this food.  They were previously on Wellness Turkey and when the cans were recalled I tried this on the suggestion of a family friend since their one cat has the same crystal issues our oldest does.  He eats his prescription dry in the morning and this at night.  Normally he's content to let the other two cats get to their food first and hold back with patience for his own, but with this it is the first time I have seen him muscle away the other two cats to eat.  I'll be sticking with this and the turkey flavor.<br /><br />Also there is no fish in this or the turkey flavor wet or dry foods which is excellent!  My cats don't tend to enjoy food that has fish in it and this is one of the few foods I can find that is both good for them and has no fish.  One of them does not like the peas in the food, he will eat around them, but one of the others eats them when he's done.  So if your cat hates bits of veggies they may not really enjoy it as much.<br /><br />Oh and one more point, it doesn't have that funky wet food smell a lot of other foods (even good ones) have.  I really can't smell it once I stand up after putting it in the bowl.

review/summary: Excellent choice for my finicky feline!
review/text: Since my elderly cat has started eating a wet food diet, she's become extremely finicky. She used to eat anything I'd put in front of her, until about a year ago when she decided nothing was good enough.  I'd been through every brand in the store...she doesn't like fish, plain chicken or lamb so my choices were limited.  When I found this, I gave it a try since she primarily likes beef. The ingredients were excellent and I read great reviews from Vets about it online.  She has been scarfing this food down from day 1 and still loves it. There are peas and carrots in it and the  consistency of it is very mushy. She likes it that way, so she doesn't have to chew much. I also noticed it doesn't dry out if there's any left in her bowl for several hours, like other brands have.  I definitely plan to continue giving this to her. I've been ordering on Amazon since it's been difficult to find it in my local pet stores lately.

review/text: Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal. Cats have hard time digesting plant matter. This is closer to dog food than cat food since dog's physiology will allow digestion of many plant based food itms. My cats ate about half of the yellow goo around the peas and carrots. If you want a true holistic approach for cats, veggies gotta go.

review/text: After my cat was diagnosed with renal failure, he refused to eat any of the canned versions of his vet prescribed food for kidney disease although he would eat Hill's Science Diet k/d dry food, but he was vomiting it up regularily. Since his diet requires low protein after searching online I finally found Spot's Stew. My cat really likes it and readily eats the chicken, turkey and salmon varieties. Granted sometimes he eats around the carrots, peas and green beans, but he does eat them. I really like that Spot's Stew is an all natural cat food with no by-products or fillers, and especially that it is an alternative for my cat that he really enjoys.

review/text: My cat loved the dry version of spot's stew.  When she was sick with a UTI, I purchased this in hopes of adding some additional fluid to her diet.  When I dumped it in her bowel, she looked up at me as if I were mad, and I couldn't blame her.  It is literally "stew," with whole chunks of peas, carrots, etc. in it.  Cats are carnivores.  I have owned several, and I have never seen one of them willingly eat a piece of fruit or vegetable, grain products excluded, that hadn't been completely ground up and disguised in something else.<br /><br />She took one sniff and walked away.  Of course, cats are unpredictable creatures and YMMV.  But there are loads of good quality pate-style wet foods and all-meat wet foods that most cats are more likely to prefer.

review/text: I purchased this for my 15 year old cat who has health issues. Unfortunately, this cat decided after about 2 cans that she was not going to eat any more health food. She didn't eat the first cans very well even though I tried giving it in the morning when she's the hungriest and she licked a couple times and then followed me around meowing for something else. I finally gave up and gave it to the other cats. Two of the seven other cats will eat it but they leave the peas and anything else that is not mashed. So as far as I'm concerned it is great food, but the cats weren't impressed.

review/summary: Wow! Cat Food That Seems Yummy!
review/text: Wow! I have the pickiest cats in the whole universe.  The only wet food they eat is Spot's Stew Chicken.  I can get them to eat the Chicken/Beef flavor if I add some shaved Bonito but with three cats Slinky, Jester and Regal, only Slinky and Jester scarf the food down.  They will eat the chicken without the Bonito but Regal is another story.  She won't eat it at first but might come back later and eat some.  She will ONLY eat the Chicken and does not like Bonito so with her, it gets a little more tough.  However, this food is a wonderful consistency, smells good (to me the human) and I assume to the kitties as well because they LOVE this stuff.  For the vegetables, I don't know if cats really need them however, I mush them up with the meat and they don't notice.  If I miss mushing some, then yes they try to eat around the peas/carrots.  All I can say is thank goodness for this food.  I spent lots of money and time trying to find something they would like.  I also feed them a mix of Halo dry Sensitive Formula Turkey and Purina Dental Health.  In order to prevent urinary symptoms, I give my cats only fresh bottled water every day that I put in bowls all over the house.  With the good water, the good food and lots of petting, I have the happiest cats in Arizona!  Thank you Halo!!

review/text: I feed my cats Halo dry food and supplement it with a little of the canned food.  They love it and they are very happy and healthy.  The canned food is amazing - looks and smells like people food.  I've been buying this for years and have no intention of switching to something else.  If you read the labels you'll see how good this stuff is.

review/text: My furry little friend, who happens not to enjoy eating and who has turned down many cat food brands, LOVES Spots Stew chicken.<br /><br />The consistency and texture are soft and fluffy, much like mousse. I am gathering by the clean plate that the flavor is just the thing to get any picky little eater to ask for seconds.

review/summary: Chicken and Beef
review/text: I have 5 cats and they all love this Chicken and Beef Recipe. Whenever I put it out at feeding time, there is a rush to the bowls that have Spot's Stew in them. With 5 kitty mouths to feed, the whole case would be gone in about 4 or 5 days if everybody got the Spot's Stew, so I put some other favorites out also and pretty soon everyone is satisfied. Since no cat eats a whole can at one sitting, those poor things that had to "settle" for Trout or some such later wander over and get their fair share of the stew. I have been so pleased with it, that I plan to order in other flavors that are also 5 star winners.<br />But, at our house, WHOLESOME CHICKEN AND BEEF are definite winners and we all recommend them to all who are looking for something to hit the spot with their felines!

review/summary: Picky felines love this canned food
review/text: My two cats somehow never figured out how to use their teeth to bite into their food--given dry food, they'll just use their tongues to lick it up and swallow the kernels whole, with an occasional bite with the teeth to crunch on food that's already been delivered into their mouths.  For a while I despaired of getting them to eat wet food, as they would just sit there and lick up all the juices, without getting much of the meat.  Typical canned food is just packed too tight, and the texture is not amenable for breaking off little bits with just their tongues.  Finally, I tried out Spot's Stew, which solved the problem.  This food is much looser, I think due to the inclusion of peas and other veggies, and the meat part is just the right consistency where they can lick it up successfully.  At first the cats would eat around the veggies, but they now lick up every morsel, and even prefer the Spot's Stew over the Wellness pouches.  I also like that the food doesn't contain any fish, as one of my cats is allergic to something or other (his back legs are always itchy, and he'll pull out the hair), and the vet suggested it might be fish.  Anyways, thank goodness for Spot's Stew, otherwise my teeth-challenged cats would never have been able to enjoy wet food!

review/summary: Cats love it!
review/text: I wasn't sure what would come of my venture in buying this food for my 2 cats that can eat poultry after reading the mixed reviews, but thought it was worth a try.  I am so glad I did!  I was expecting a stew like another reviewer said, and I guess you could refer to it that way.  When I opened the first can that is what I was expecting to see, but instead it is a course pate with chunks of veges in it. Kind of like a toddler food.  Cats are tricky to please for sure, but mine loved everything about this food.  They not only ate the chunks of veges, but licked their bowls clean.  I love the fact that it was such a hit, and will continue to buy it for them.  I also love that is like something you would make for them at home, only with all the right vitamins and minerals added.  Very user friendly.  My 3rd cat cannot eat poultry, so until Halo makes one without chicken in it, she will be fine with her Nature's variety instinct rabbit and Tiki foods.<br />UPDATE - 11-16-2011  My cat has been eating this now for a little while and she always seems hungry when she gets this!  I don't think I will be buying more for her.  I do think it is a good food and probably perfect for cats that need the lower protein, but mine need less moisture in the food and more meat.  I always add about a tablespoon of water on their canned food anyway.  Cost wise, this is about the same as Natures Variety, Natures Logic and even Addiction which are wonderful foods.  I like it better when I add the moisture and am paying for meat in their food.

And none seem to pick out the veggies!  The soft texture, and good nutrition, is excellent for (1) the elderly cat (2) the cat who's sick and (3) the cat who will literally eat anything, but you'd prefer he eat something healthy!<br /><br />This is "human quality" cat food, meaning the ingredients are pure enough for a human to eat, and it smells a little like chicken pot pie filling!

review/text: I have a kitten that just LOVES this stuff. The breeder I got him from didn't give me any of his old food, and I had heard that switching food quickly causes stomach upset... but I read about Spot's Stew being great for problem tummies and it's true! My kitten has never had any problems on this food since we brought him home. Also, from the human perspective, this stuff smells like chicken/turkey/fish and not like dog vomit, like certain brands of cat food. Big plus for me.

review/text: The texture of this food is like cooled pea soup.  It's not as stiff as some of the pate style foods and my cat likes it.  All but the veggies that is.  So she leaves not only the veggies, and there are a lot of them, but also a good bit of the chicken surrounding each veggy.  This makes for more waste than I am willing to tolerate so I won't be buying any more Spot's Stew.

review/text: The first time I served this they both chowed down on it...except for the veges as everyone seems to complain about...but then a little while later they both came back and finished up the veges too!  So I thought this was the greatest thing...but the next time I fed them the one cat decided the novelty had worn off and wanted nothing to do with it.  The other one though continued to chow down, and again left the veges, but came back later and ate most of them.  The next serving -what do you know -neither of them wanted it anymore.  I don't get it -I've never had cats like something so much one day and the next day be turned off from it.  I'm very disappointed, I wanted them to like it, knowing how good it is for them.

However, I've started squishing the carrots into the food, and they seem to be leaving less in their bowls. After trying many brands of canned foods, this is one of the few that they eagerly eat, and it doesn't smell as bad as some.

I lie and tell her that this is a chocolate ball and when she remembers it isn't, I tell her it is a liver ball and that gets her every time.  I like this as much as the pouches now on the market.  The product is worth the price, but care is necessary so that the pill is covered and doesn't become uncovered in the process.  My dog is smart, though not all that smart, and needs to take several pills daily to keep from being in pain, to control her thyroid.  Youth is in the mind of the beholder, and with aids like this even my 11 year od Old English Sheepdog behaves like a puppy.

My puppy has to take a HUGE (1" long!) pill daily and she gobbles it up in this.  They get so excited when they hear me opening the pill containers they sit in "beg mode"!<br /><br />The only downside is that if you have long nails, it gets caught underneath and can be a pain to clean out. But, even so it's worth the scrubbing not to have to fight them to take their pills every day!

A bag has 130 calories, so I use half at a time as a between meal or before bedtime snack.  They have a low glycemic load, and are slowly absorbed and metabolized, thus leveling the blood glucose response. At under $2.00 a bag, they are also cost effective.

review/summary: This is a nice box of goodies... But know the limitations!
review/text: This is a very nice box filled with well-selected goodies. My wife really loved it, but she really likes decorative boxes of this sort - and she was almost as excited about the box as she was about the contents!<br /><br />If you are buying this for the contents, you'll do better to go to the store and buy a bunch of stuff yourself. The dollar value of the contents quite a bit less than the purchase price.<br /><br />But if you are buying this as a gift and the lovely box is a big part of the appeal, then this is a nice choice.<br /><br />For me, and for my wife, it was a very fine choice indeed!

review/summary: Great Product, Bad Price
review/text: I use baking soda for a LOT of household things (cleaning, cooking, personal care, etc).  I was first tempted by this seemingly economized 12 pound bag.  However, when I compared to the smaller containers at my local grocery store - I realized this was not the best way to purchase baking soda.<br /><br />Right now for 12lbs of the generic brand (12, 16 oz. boxes) I would pay just 10.68 (13.08 regular).<br /><br />For the A&H brand I could buy 12lbs in the following ways:<br />12, 16 oz. boxes for 13.80<br />6, 32 oz. boxes for 10.62<br />3, 64 oz. boxes for 8.97<br /><br />That's nearly ten dollars less for the same amount of the same product.  Although the bag is probably more convenient than 3-12 boxes - the boxes are recyclable and the bag is not.  Just some things to think about!

review/summary: Good Product
review/text: My household goes through a lot of baking soda from baking to cleaning, this is a great multi use product. I could get it cheaper from the local grocery store by 3 dollars if I would have purchased 3 large boxes but living in a smaller space we are trying to cut down of bulk, so this stores nicely.

review/summary: Great cat food.  It's a keeper!
review/text: All 3 of my cats love this food.  They were previously on Wellness Turkey and when the cans were recalled I tried this on the suggestion of a family friend since their one cat has the same crystal issues our oldest does.  He eats his prescription dry in the morning and this at night.  Normally he's content to let the other two cats get to their food first and hold back with patience for his own, but with this it is the first time I have seen him muscle away the other two cats to eat.  I'll be sticking with this and the turkey flavor.<br /><br />Also there is no fish in this or the turkey flavor wet or dry foods which is excellent!  My cats don't tend to enjoy food that has fish in it and this is one of the few foods I can find that is both good for them and has no fish.  One of them does not like the peas in the food, he will eat around them, but one of the others eats them when he's done.  So if your cat hates bits of veggies they may not really enjoy it as much.<br /><br />Oh and one more point, it doesn't have that funky wet food smell a lot of other foods (even good ones) have.  I really can't smell it once I stand up after putting it in the bowl.
