review/summary: UMMMM!!!!!!
review/text: I usually dont like black herbal tea, but this one i was able to sip on the whole cup without making a face. It is full of aroma and tastes much better than the usual herbal teas that i have tasted in the past. The Rose flavour is the best. How much it really calms u, god only knows, but the pleasure is unbeatable.

review/summary: Good Inexpensive Cleanser.
review/text: This tea really works. Drink a big cup before bed and in the morning you will have to use the bathroom. Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now.

I guess it "worked" because my daughter was born after just 4 hours of labor and 20 minutes of pushing.  I'm still drinking it since I had just ordered another 3-pack of boxes of it the day before our baby was born.  My husband loves the tea too and he doesn't even have a uterus.

I have continued to drink this every night and I still sleep well but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night once in a while.  I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.  I recommended this to my family and co workers and they all love it.  I discovered this from Dr. Oz.  Hoping to continue to sleep well.

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

I think this tea is very light flavored. I usually put some honey in it and it goes down great.<br /><br />As for the rest, I've only been using it (3 times a day) for the past 7 days and haven't gone a full cycle yet, so I don't know if it really does work for PMS yet or not.

review/text: I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

I have to warn that the tea doesn't "kick in" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it.

review/text: I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells.

review/summary: Fenugreek Seed Tea
review/text: I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

Works just as well and is not individually wrapped as the others are and for me it's just one less thing I have to do considering I fix this every evening for me and hubby... I have medical problems so anything that saves me extra step I'm happy for it...

review/summary: Nasty tea debris everywhere!
review/text: When I opened this alot of the tea sacks were broken and the tea emptied out and spilled everywhere. I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!

review/summary: Sage Tea - helping with hot flashes
review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/text: If you're looking for a healthy, light whole wheat flour to cook with, a nutritionist recommended KING ARTHUR'S WHITE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR. It has the nutrition of whole wheat with the consistency of white flour--so it's not too heavy and gritty. I make gravies, soups, muffins, pancakes, cookies etc.--everything with it. I'll never buy white non-nutritious flour again! I never feel guilty cooking with this as I know it's healthy for my family and provides necessary whole grains. I love cooking with this flour and use it all the time.

review/summary: Worked Fantastic
review/text: My lil' Amy was a rescue kitten found abandon on the side of the road.  She looked pitiful and sickly when I got her since her hair was thin and patchy.  I couldn't help but fall in love with the poor thing, and trying to nurse her back to health.  Unfortuantely, she had constant diarrhea and I ended up trying several brands of kitten food before finally setting on Purina ONE's sensitive formula for kittens.  She blossomed beautifully with the stuff- growing a thick fur coat and had no more litter problems.  After she grew out of the kitten stage, and since money was tight, I put her on Whiskas.  While she loved it and looked fine, I wasn't monitoring her food and she grew really fat and lazy.  When I gave her less, she would constantly meow at her empty bowl.<br />  I bought Purina ONE's weight/hairball formula and gave her the amount of food she wanted to eat.  Even with a minimal decrease in food intake, she started losing weight within a few weeks, and is finally  down to a normal weight a few months later.  She seems to be a more active as well.  I rarely hear any hairball-hacking, even though she spends most of the day grooming herself.  Best of all, my fellow cat-owning friends have asked what brand of food and shampoo I use since her fur is super shiny and very silky.  It is well worth the few extra dollars a month for food since I ended up with a healthier cat.

review/summary: Fantastic Product!  Haven't found a dog yet that dosen't like it!
review/text: I think this is the best dog food on the market today. It is made of wholesome natural ingredients, contains no corn, soy or wheat and the first ingredient is natural chicken.  I have been feeding this product for about 2 years now to my 3 Dachshunds. I used to feed Royal Canin for Dachshunds which after getting the last dog became very expensive. As the first 2 were minis and the last is the largest dachshund I had ever seen, I found this product and slowly started to introduce it, so that I was running a 50/50 mixture. I then noticed that they were only eating certain pieces of the food and leaving the rest, that's when I stopped adding the Royal Canin Breed specific. When I couldn't find this product in 30 lb. bags in the stores, I decided I would switch them over to a Blue Buffalo product. So I slowly started to add in some Blue Buffalo, which did not agree with my dogs at all. So back to the Natural Ultramix Weight Management formula as the dachshund is known for becoming overweight. I had even been buying it in 5.5 lb. bags until I found the 30 lb. bags online and because I live in Canada, had to find a way to have it delivered to an address in the States. I managed to resolve that problem, and since then the manufactorer has stopped putting it out in 30 lb. bags. So I now purchase 2-15 lb. bags at a time and will continue to do so.<br /><br />A good friend of mine got a Chocolate Lab from the pound and was looking for a good dog food to feed that her dog would eat, I mentioned this product to her. Because this product is only available in the US she decided to try the Blue Buffalo. When her vet recommended that her still finicky dog loose some weight she asked me for a sample. Her dog loved it but when she went to order it,the 30 lb. bag was no longer available and at the time the 15 lb. bags were out of stock and my fear was that they were only going to sell it in the 5.5 lb. bags. Since then her dog has lost the required weight and she has now put her on the Large Breed Formula.<br /><br />My neighbour got a Siberian Husky from the pound and couldn't find a good food the dog would eat, in fact the dog was not eating enough and the vet wanted to see a weight gain of at least 10 lbs. She had her on Blue Buffalo and she was still was picking at it. I had offered her some for her dog to try explaining it was a weight management, and they had other types available. She put a bowl of it down beside a bowl of the Blue Buffalo product. The dog started picking pieces of fruits and vegetables out of the Ultramix and eventually ate the kibble without touching the Blue Buffalo she had been on. She has been on the large breed formula for just over a month, she has gained 4 lbs this month compared to the 2 the previous month.<br /><br />I would, and do highly recommend this product for any dog. I could not find this product on the True Blue Test. I am hoping the more people talk and praise this companies excellent products, that maybe the will bring back the 30 lb. bags in the Weight Management Formula, as most of their products are available in the 30 lb. bags.

review/text: I found Castor & Pollux after feeding my English cocker spaniels another brand of premium dog food.  While the other food was excellent, this product is superb.  They love the food, and their weight has remained healthy.  Since they are seven years old, the veterinarian always checks their weight and body fat to make certain that they are not candidates for heart and joint problems.  With this diet, they each weigh less than 25 pounds, and they are remarkably agile for their age.  I cannot recommend this food enough for owners of older dogs--and this seller was excellent.  The food came well packaged and arrived quickly.

review/text: I LOVE this dog food ! My Bulldogs LOVE this dog food ! I moisten half of their serving in warm vitamin infused water, then add the the other half of the portion, the dry mix. I also add a Methycellulose tablet to the mix to help them feel full & keep their weight down even more. They inhale it. I have not noticed them being gassy, as Bulldogs are prone to. I measure out their portions every time their fed, (2x a day.) The fact that this food has no corn, soy or wheat is wonderful. It has pieces of cranberries, carrot, peas, and banana chips all mixed throughout. For 2 female bulldogs I go through 30 pounds a month, and receive it on "Subscribe & Save." It is the best dog food I have come across BAR NONE !

You can put them in your pocket, purse, or even a wallet depending on the size of your wallet.  All you need is hot water and you will have a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: When grading on a curve, Via holds up.
review/text: I've tried both the Italian and Colombian Via varities, and while there's definitely a 'Starbuckiness' to both, neither is a substitute for the real thing. However there are times when the real thing just doesn't work, and at those times Via gets just enough things right to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I'll start out with the negatives. Both varieties remind of drinking from a pot of 'yesterdays' coffee. The kind where you can't finish the pot of coffee and rather than toss it all out, you let it sit and cool overnight and then reheat it the next morning. The next day the coffee is always more bitter and the flavor is flat as compared to a fresh brewed cup. Adding milk or cream helps, but the underlying flavor is still a bit off-putting.<br /><br />Though the worst part about the Via brand is the after-taste. There's something off about it. I don't know quite how to describe it. Almost like a tinge of paper/cardboard taste to it which is a bummer. I find I drink a cup of Via faster than a normal cup of coffee in order to combat that after-taste.<br /><br />Having said all that, I think I'm still likely to continue buying the Via brand. I understand this is instant coffee. I mean I'm tearing open a little pouch (love the design), dropping in some hot water, and I've got coffee. Just like that. That's pretty great. That ease of use, and fairly reasonable pricing means that in circumstances in which convenience trumps quality I can find a place for Via. Camping, too lazy to drive to a coffee shop, otherwise stuck drinking Folgers, quick pick-me-up during a zombie invasion, etc... are a few examples of when a packet of Via could come in handy.

review/summary: Only regret - expiration date
review/text: I don't use VIA packets frequently, but I like to keep them on hand. When I purchased the 12-pack decaf VIA packets in the Starbucks store, the best before date was at least a few months away. The 6-pack of 3-count packets which I received from Amazon has a best before date which is about 5 weeks away. I doubt I can use 18 packets in 5 weeks, but I also saved a good amount versus what I would have paid in the store. It's really a matter of individual usage. Perhaps many people use one packet every couple of days, but I usually don't need it that frequently.

review/text: For being an instant coffee, Via is very good, but don't expect it to have the aroma or flavor of fresh brewed Italian Roast.  Very convenient, and no clean up.  Tried the Via French Roast because there were a few reviews about how it's the best.  Still prefer the Via Italian Roast... the Via French Roast is not any darker as you'd expect in the real coffee world, plus it has a tiny hint of a strange aroma/flavor.

review/summary: Fair Substitute for no local Starbucks
review/text: Overall I've been very pleased with Starbucks' VIA products.  I've only tried the Italian and Columbia varieties.  The convenience is a major factor, and it beats the pants off anything "instant" I've ever had before.  Great for backpacking.  The ability to do a 50-count bulk purchase is the way to go, though, as buying 3-packs locally is steep--but perhaps not so much when one considers the price of a cup of the real thing.  My only beef is that my most recent purchase had a "best by" date just 2.5 months away (a complaint I've seen others make).  I spoke with a Starbucks rep who claimed it was still going to be fine for some unspecified time beyond that date, that they'd take my return if desired, but that they couldn't promise that the date on whatever replacement shipped from the warehouse would be any further distant.  Kind of lame...but I'm going through it quickly enough that the question is probably moot.

We had a system of grinding our beans and doing a cup at a time with our coffee that we brought with us.  We ran out in the middle of not coffee country.  We did find a Starbucks and got some Via to tide us over.  It isn't the Americano my husband does for us at home, but it has become a good substitute when we are traveling.  Still love our own beans...but this is good.  Certainly not like any other instant I have tasted...much, much, much better.

review/summary: Surprisingly Fresh, Rich Coffee Taste for Instant, but Pricey
review/text: I am a devotee of freshly made espresso coffee every morning which I make at home with a vacuum espresso pot. The results are a very full-bodied, strong coffee(I use Costco's Kirkland brand Columbian Supremo) that I add just hot water and half and half to. Similar to a double shot Cafe Americano at an espresso bar.<br /><br />I am absolutely NOT a fan of Starbuck's overpriced and over roasted coffee. I also despise coffeemaker Folgers coffee, if I can avoid it! And other instant coffee tastes bitter and watery to me.<br /><br />However, these little packets are quick, pack anywhere--like a purse, glovebox or suitcase--and make a fascinatingly GOOD cup of coffee.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, on the strong side but no "Burnt" taste, and close to freshly brewed coffee as -- sheesh, it tastes like a fresh brewed cup. I am impressed. I add water and my half and half and it's better than good. I love Columbian coffee and this is the flavor I hoped for.<br /><br />Starbucks has done this right!<br /><br />The Downside: The cost is really an issue. I paid $5+ at Starbucks for a 3 pack. Then I got a 3 pack at Walmart recently for $2.99. This offer gets you more for about 80 cents each, but for instant? So I give the VIA coffee a 4 star rating even at the cheaper price.<br /><br />The quality is there though, so I plan to get some for my business trips out of town (no more running out for an expensive espresso) or as a backup in my purse. But I still use my espresso maker for my everyday cup.

review/summary: Better than other instant coffees...
review/text: I bought this when I saw that the price for 50 was much better than the price of the 8-pack or whatever in the SB store. I decided to give it a try. VIA coffee has a full flavor compared to other instant coffees, but it still isn't as good as a fresh cuppajoe. I love the convenience of these packages, since in my job, I don't always have time to go and find a cup of coffee. I can pour bottled water into my mug, pop it in the nuker, and then just pour the package into the steaming water. It also seems to be stronger than typical coffee, as far as the caffeine. All in all, I feel like I made a good choice. If I were you, and you were me, we'd be each other, and you'd know how I feel about the VIA coffee. I should mention here that I am NOT a huge fan of Starbucks coffee in general, but I was impressed with VIA. ONE COMPLAINT... the package. When you open the package, the opening is so narrow, that when you try to pour it into your steaming water, the steam makes the coffee powder get all sticky and clogs the opening. Other than that, I'm pretty happy with VIA. (But I'd rather have a nice fresh cup of french-press... or Dutch-press =))

review/text: Although this is one of the best instant coffees in the world, I second another review here. Although getting a bulk pack of 50 of this at less than $1/pack (cheaper than buying it a Strbux) the expiration is 6 months. So, unless you consume one of these at least 2-3 times per week - which I don't per se - watch out. Also, I shaved off a star bc of the poor packaging design of the individual packets. When you tear off the corner (the way they indicate where and how to open it)  the opening is still very small and a fair amount of powder is still left in the packet unless you shake it vigorously and make sure it all comes out, or simply chop off the top with a scissor.

review/summary: The perfect compromise: Drinkable instant coffee
review/text: Better than all other instants, as good as many brewed coffees, Starbucks VIA is a great balance between fast, easy and good.  Heat your water, tap the powder out of the tube into a cup, pour and stir.  No grinding, no filters, no mudding the beans; it's just as fast, and just as easy, and spooning crystals out of a jar.  But Starbucks VIA is far, far superior to any other kind of instant, and gives a lot of second rate brews a run for their money.  Is it as good as my best beans, freshly ground and brewed?  No.  But it's better than the coffee that comes out of Keurig packs, and better than the coffee from fast-food restaurants.  And it's instant.  Sometimes you'll want to take the time and trouble for the best possible cup of coffee; and sometimes you'll just want a dang cup of something hot, strong and black.  For those times VIA is a great choice.

review/text: This product gets a 4 star vs 5 star due to one little factor, bitterness. For the most part making a cup of coffee without a coffee maker couldn't be more easy or delicious, though I find that these Via Ready Brews (all flavors I've tried so far) have often a hint of a bitter after taste. Its not so bad that its undesirable, however, I'm sure that goes with having the ground micro-ground to produce your coffee as opposed to filtering through larger grounds to make coffee. I will say as for 'instant' coffee - this is one of the best I've had. Each flavor has a distinct aroma and taste. Doesn't quite replace a freshly brewed cup of coffee though.

review/text: This coffee is THE BEST way to start your work day. The added bonus of not paying what you would pay at a Starbucks for essentially the same thing is an even better way to start your day :)<br /><br />Flavor: rich, bold and full-bodied. I've had other kinds of instant before and although I do prefer to use my moka pot for coffee, this makes a REALLY nice alternative.<br /><br />This coffee leaves no lingering aftertaste, the aroma is incredible and the taste is fresh brewed. You can't beat that! I keep stashes of these at work and in my handbag. Mmmm!

review/summary: Great!
review/text: I just tried the Columbia Medium and I am in LOVE! I was pretty skeptical of an instant coffee but found it at the grocery market for $1 for the package of 3. At first, I thought it was going to be way too strong and bitter but I was pleasantly surprised. It was smooth and full of flavor as if I just bought it fresh at the cafe. I added Truvia to it also and couldn't have had a better cup 'o joe. I am hooked!

review/summary: Other packings
review/text: Real great coffee ! But I suggest that the coffee be also brought out in bulk packings like cartons,cans or bottles in half,one or two pounds  for facilitating regular home usage.The current packing may be useful for travel and restaurant use only.

review/summary: Really bad packaging. Really good marketing
review/text: I travel a lot, often to places where nescafe (ugh) is high end. So my comfort was Via but the packaging is so irresponsible. So I experimented. I have now taken several multi-week trips with a plastic bag of  Bustelo Instant Espresso  measured out from a jar. I used it with just boiling water - or hot milk and water - its as good if not better than Via despite my snobby skepticism about preservation of taste. And I feel I am not adding as much  to a scary pile of non biodegradable waste. Starbucks says they care about environmental stuff but I'm not a crunchy and I can see how marketing has over-run ethic.

review/text: When my box arrived the product already was past the pull dated. . .  I got 200 vias not that are past the pull date.  I did not read anywhere on the purchase that i would be buying an inferior product.  I would not have purchased 200 if i had known they were all past the pull date. . .
