review/summary: UNSURE?  Its REAL simple: Just read the ingredients!
review/text: HEY, this sauce is REAL, no phony, cheap ingredients (like SOYBEAN oil?!) or other junk - just GOURMET ingredients that taste GREAT! You can't imagine the difference until YOU TRY IT! If you're concerned that this excellent sauce comes in PLASTIC JARS, be assured that these containers are BPA free! So no problem using them in the microwave! Also, you can REUSE these nice jars - just soak off the label, use Goo Gone to remove the glue, and wash them. They are DISHWASHER SAFE (top rack.)  I use them for my freezer jams and for microwave mini meals, and since the lid SCREWS ON, there is no leakage when I tote them around! YES, this is an AUTHENIC Italian style Marinara sauce and you will NOT be disappointed! Try it!

review/summary: Simply all tomato-deliciousness
review/text: The sauce is not just a sauce, the tomato pieces in there are simply delicous; good size pieces, nicely cooked down (no skin) and the taste was just 'simple and all tomato goodness'.  It was over flavored, and if you want a dash of salt or pepper then you can adjust it.  But we loved it just as it was with some great gluten pasta and vegetables.  It is as good as you can get from a great italian restaurant.  So much better than any expensive brands in jars that we have tried in the supermarket.  Price comparison-wise, it is very reasonable.<br /><br />Better still, there is no gluten in this ready made product; so for me, finally, one less thing to have to make myself.  we love it and cant wait to try this out on other recipes.  Also, the jar can be reused for other things: well made and solid.

review/summary: Food Allergies - Beware - Product ingredients listed is not complete
review/text: The only comment I will make is in regards to the ingredients listed.  On Amazon it is not listed that this product contains Citric Acid.  When the product arrived I reviewed the ingredients on the jar and there was Citric Acid on the list. If you are allergic to yeast then you will be avoiding any product that contains Citric Acid.  According to my M.D. yeast is used in the manufacture of Citric Acid.  My M.D. advises those allergic to yeast to avoid Citric Acid. Therefore, sadly, I will not be eating this sauce which I was really looking forward to doing.

review/summary: Blah
review/text: My family uses Classico, which is O.K. but not great. Based upon the fabulous reviews of this product on Amazon we tried Scarpetta. Not impressed favorably. No flavor other than tomato, no suggestion of spices or garlic and a very sour aftertaste that both my wife and I noted. We haven't yet tried the Bolognese but are not expecting much there, either, as the label shows no garlic and it is made without meat. The purchaser is supposed to add his own meat. Bolognese is traditionally simmered a long time (as are other Italian sauces) which allows the meat flavor to meld with the other flavors.<br /><br />Jars arrived intact but I don't understand the excitement over the jars. I can't think of a use to which I can put them that wouldn't be better served by plastic containers with snap on lids. Therefore I won't be re-using them.

review/text: This sauce does taste very fresh and I've actually found a couple twigs in the sauces.  However, for a little more you can get an even better tasting sauce (i.e. Gia Russa) in most grocery stores- ones that do not need to be refrigerated, so they may not taste as 'fresh', but they have better flavor.

review/summary: Good aromatic and tasty cumin
review/text: As Indians we use a lot of cumin seeds in everyday cooking. Buying them at the local store was turning out to be very expensive so when I spotted this on amazon I thought of it giving it a go! And since no one had written a review, it was a gamble.<br /><br />The package was well-packed, arrived in time (2 days after ordering) and the cumin seeds taste and smell wonderful. Just as expected. I highly recommend the product and the company. Will definitely order this again and try other spices from the same brand.

review/text: I was looking forward to this candy because we can't find it around our area and when it arrived in a mailing bag and not in a box like it says I was skepticle about what it would be like when opened. It was a mess, they were all stuck together and wrapped in a piece of waxed paper and shoved in a plastic bag. Well you can imagine what they looked like and not fit to eat. I am sending them back and hope they give me a refund. I will send them back just like I got them and maybe they will see why they were sent back. The bad part is I have to pay for shipping them back when it wasn't my fault. I doubt that I order from this place again. I have pictures to prove what I am saying.

review/summary: Great Candy Treats - High Quality
review/text: I would have said this purchase was perfect but for one fact.  The variety of flavors were not evenly divided. For example of the 5 flavors in the package the orange slices (a family favorite) were only about 1/40 in number, while the lime flavors (not a family favorite) were more like 3/10. That, however, was the only disappointment.

review/summary: Lowest price for organic coconut milk I've found.
review/text: If you go through a good bit of coconut milk for protein shakes, ketogenic diets, or cooking, this is definitely the best value I've found. At about $1.25 for the equivalent of a 13.5 oz. can, it's about half the price of what you would pay for organic coconut milk at a grocery store. And since Amazon delivers to your door, you don't have to lug heavy cans around.<br /><br />Just be aware how much coconut milk is in a can (the cans are actually 99 oz., not 96 oz. as they're shown.), and that coconut milk should be used within a few days after opened.<br /><br />If you're pouring the coconut milk into a bottle, you'll need a funnel or ladle. Otherwise, you're going to spill some of the milk.<br /><br />This coconut milk has a pleasant flavor, and is some of the best I've tried. It does tend to separate a bit, making some of it almost cream-like and other parts watery, but shaking well should prevent the separation.<br /><br />A couple of the cans arrived dented, which did not affect the quality of the coconut milk.<br /><br />A great value for high-quality, organic coconut milk.

review/summary: Good, a bit pricey
review/text: I'm a long-time customer of McDougall Right Foods, dating back to early 2004.<br /><br />The main selling point of Right Foods cups is that they are "vegan", meaning that there are nothing animal-related in them (no meat, fish, dairy, eggs, or byproducts of such).  All ingredients are natural (no chemicals added).  Even the cup container itself is labeled "food-grade".  Some (not all) food cups contain only organic ingredients, and some are gluten-free; each cup is so labeled if applicable.<br /><br />The cups provide a fast snack or meal-idea: pour boiling water into the cup, stir, let stand a few minutes, and eat or pour over such as pasta and rice.<br /><br />The company does well to make the food cups taste good, and each individual will have his/her own favorites.<br /><br />Keep in mind that McDougall food cups are aimed at the vegan/health-consicious market.  Since they are pricey (the large cups go for almost $2.00 each), I wouldn't recommend them for non-vegans/vegetarians, as there are many less-expensive (and less-healthy) alternatives.  Amazon sells the food cups for less than the Right Foods website does; the company website has a larger variety.<br /><br />Those who are vegan or thinking of becoming vegan would do well to visit Dr. McDougall's website (drmcdougall dot com) for more information.

review/summary: Edible Ramen
review/text: Let me start by saying that until now the only use I had for ramen noodles was possibly using them as packing material.  I truly did not consider them food until now.  I came into my kitchen following the smell of some really good oriental food cooking.  When I entered the kitchen looking for the source of the delicious aroma I found my college age son munching on what appeared to be a instant noodle cup.  Upon further investigation I found that the really good oriental flavor and aroma were coming out of that cup.  I'm hooked.

review/summary: I really like this pilaf
review/text: I don't eat much packed food, but I saw a Dr. McDougall's tortilla soup in the health food section of Publix.  The ingredients are all natural, vegan and are low in sodium and calories.  I loved the tortilla soup, so I bought six packages, along with 6 packages of the chicken pilaf on Amazon.  Although I prefer the tortilla soup, the pilaf is excellent for a dehydrated food product.  I will probably eat Dr. McDougall's soups for lunch every day until I get burned out on them.  The reviewer who gave this pilaf one star said that there were only about four bites in the meal, but I find it to be very filling.  The container says that the soups and pilaf will serve 2, but this is really a meal for one.  The whole container contains 260 calories.

review/summary: My favorite Dr. McDougall product
review/text: This is my favorite Dr. McDougall product(the miso soup and white bean soup are close runner ups). When I feel like making a vegetarian country meal on the quick, I use this rice and pair it with one of Morningstar Farms vegetarian riblets.  The rice is very savory and takes less time to make than other rice dishes.<br /><br />Like most of this line, the cup's contents are dry and the user must add water and the flavor packet and pop the cup in the microwave for several minutes. I generally think the company suggests too much water for the products and that is no exception for this rice.  When I have use the recommended amount of water, I always end up with rice soup. Using less water allows me to eat rice, rather than soup, and to experience a very concentrated flavor. I will also note that the rice needs a longer sitting time than most McDougall products.  After heating, you truly need to wait 5-7 minutes for the rice to completely cook.<br /><br />One annoying aspect of McDougall products is that all the "big cups" are two servings. For most McDougall products, I typically think this is ridiculous because two servings really seem to be the equivalent of one .  This is especially the case with McDougall soups.  With this rice cup, as long as you are pairing it with something else, one serving is fairly filling and you should be able to save half of the cup for a later meal. If you do eat the whole cup, just be sure to double the calories if you keep a calorie log or are trying to remain aware of sodium, carbohydrates, etc.

review/text: I did NOT buy this from Amazon after seeing the price - you can get it MUCH cheaper at the big Midwest box store. But, In Indiana with the humidity and aphids wreaking havoc on my roses, I was desperate to find something that would not "burn" the leaves and new blooms like so many rose sprays do. You can use this on plants that are totally dry (no required water misting before) and you will see results the next day. I almost lost a whole row of bushes to the yellow and black spotty rose disease and this literally saved them overnight. The insect activity also stopped. I do not know how this would work in different climates, but it works wonders in a dry yet humid environment!

review/text: A bit hard to get from the container into your spray bottle without spilling a bit or getting it on yourself (comes out as a very thick gooey gel), but once it's mixed with water and shaken up a bit it's fine. One thing I noticed is that after applying there is a fine powdery dust leftover on the leaves. I guess this is normal for a combo product such as this since this also has a miticide and fungicide, but if you buy standalone insecticidal soaps you don't typically see this. Either way it gets the job done, kills mites and other annoying insects fast, and has the added benefit that if you're using it on edible plants you can eat them right away!

review/summary: Disappointed at this product.
review/text: I finally opened it today in hope to save Hibiscus bush from giant whiteflies invasion for once.  Regardless of what the package said, for me, this is a Castile soap paste.  I mixed it with gallon water tank (Note: It will be the easiest if you mix it with 2-3x amount of warm water before pouring the full amount water in  and went straight to spread.  It really felt like spreading soap water to wash the bush.  Castile soap does not smell pleasant, especially spreading the whole gallon of it.  My friend and the pest control workers who were working on other issues didn't want to even get near the bush during or after.  I actually love the smell natural spring water with sulfur in it, but I wan't fond of this smell at all.<br /><br />I would probably go with something smell much better and very possibly something cheaper, maybe even start to mix my own.  The pest control worker showed me their product (unfortunately you need a pest control license to get that one) with peppermint and rosemary oil spray.  I would love to be an insect after smelling it and it's just as effective as this product.

review/text: We also couldn't find the Spearmint mints in the store and were very glad Amazon had them.  This was in 2009, and we just reordered and the mints have changed.  It is not the same mint, beware. It tastes bad, especially when you are expecting the old mint.  It doesnt' even look the same.

review/summary: The best Japanese sweetened condensed milk candy!
review/text: I fell in love with these delicious little hard candies after a trip to a small Japanese import store. If you've ever enjoyed tres leches cake, eaten a spoonful of sweetened condensed milk straight from the can, or delighted in the taste of dulce de leche, then you will likely adore these candies as well.<br /><br />About the size of a small marble, these cream-colored hard candies melt slowly into a rich, sweet milky flavor that manages to avoid being too cloyingly sweet. If you're the kind to crunch your candies, these will offer a pleasant resistance and crack/crunch satisfyingly under your teeth. The flavor is superb; I prefer to savor mine slowly, sometimes enjoying one along with a rich cup of dark coffee to enhance the sweet milky taste.<br /><br />Unlike any candy flavor found in traditional US markets, Japanese milk candies are a special treat. These Mikakuto Tokuno UHA 8.2 milk candies are the cream of the crop--the best of the best!

Whereas your spoonful of the sweetened condensed milk goes away rather quickly... these hard candies let you savor that sweetness much longer!<br /><br />Sweet-teeth everywhere should enjoy :-D

review/summary: A delicious Christmas gift; perfect for care packages & distant friends
review/text: McSteven's cocoa makes an excellent Christmas gift. We send a holiday care package to our friends living overseas each year. Each package includes an assortment of gifts and treats, which we try to buy from local companies here in the Northwest (McSteven's is based in Vancouver, Washington).<br /><br />The cocoa is rich and creamy. While you can make your hot chocolate with just hot water, we recommend using hot milk instead for a more decadent cup.<br /><br />McSteven's Olde English Toffee Cocoa is packaged in 14-ounce tins, a nostalgic metal canister with a pry top plug. The size is 3.2"W x 8"H. Each order includes three tins.<br /><br />Each tin holds 11 servings. The ingredients are: sugar, nonfat dry milk, whey (milk), cocoa powder (Dutch Process), canola oil, corn syrup solids, natural and artificial flavors, guar gum and salt. According to the company, no hydrogenated oils are used, so your cocoa is transfat free, too.<br /><br />The back of the canister also includes a number of recipes.<br /><br />In summary, this is delicious cocoa. We purchased both McSteven's Olde English Toffee Cocoa and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPY7Y">McSteven's Jolly Blend Cocoa</a>. The price is reasonable and the charming packaging makes these cocoa blends an attractive Christmas gift, one that is easy to ship to distant friends.<br /><br />BTW: In addition to these cocoas, we also purchased and recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKUY78">Chocolove Premium Chocolate Bars, Raspberries in Dark Chocolate</a> as a Christmas gift.<br /><br />Last year, we bought truffle collections from Seattle Chocolates to send overseas. Each order -- Blackberry Cr&egrave;me Truffles, White Chocolate Orange Truffles and Pink Polka Dot Assorted Truffles - included three boxes of individually wrapped truffles. These chocolates are no longer available on Amazon but keep an eye out should they return.

review/summary: Dim Chocolate
review/text: I have an absolute passion for deep, dark hot chocolate. I want chocolate which tastes like *chocolate*, rich and flavorful, with a hint of a bite. You can savor chocolate like that.<br />What I have an aversion to is hot sugar. And, most hot mixes taste just like that; you might as well suck on a cube of sugar with a sprinkling of coca on top than drink a cup.<br />Regrettably, McSteven's Dark Chocolate European Coca Mix fell into the latter category. It had a bit more chocolate than, say, Nestles mini marshmallow or Swiss Miss Yodel, but all in all...sugar cube. Nicht goot.

review/text: Zhena's Gypsy Earl Green tea is a fragrant pleasure. The bergamot flavor of Earl Grey does just as well (if not better) with the good-quality green tea they select for this blend.<br /><br />You can pretty much count on any Zhena tea to be something special. I also like that the round, string-free tea bags are *not* individually wrapped. The attractive tins are both reusable and recyclable--but I have to wonder how much of the price covers the marketing design and the packaging. Apparently you can buy refill packages of tea bags, but I haven't seen them on Amazon (maybe I'm not trying hard enough). That quibble aside, you do get 6 more bags than in many of the cardboard boxes out there.<br /><br />Lovely tea!

review/summary: It was okay, but didn't really help
review/text: I bought this dog food after the "Tainted Dog Food" incident this year.  I did some research to look for an alternative for my sensitive and allergic labracollie, and liked that Addiction used free-range animals and seemed to use natural ingredients.  My dog loved the taste and dug right into it.<br /><br />I had her on this diet for almost two weeks.  I bought two bags at a local mom and pop pet store, but it did not particularly improve her stool--which is a big factor for me and her digestive health.  Her stool was still softer than normal.  Another issue I found was that the Venison meal was very high in protein.  My dog is nine years-old and not as active as before, so I wasn't very fond of the protein content.  This dog food may be better-suited for active or younger dogs.<br /><br />At my local pet store, they also have Lamb, La Porchetta, Salmon Bleu, and a couple other puppy variations.  I bought Lamb and Porchetta as well.  Among the three my dog ate, she seemed to like the Venison the best.  I knew this because she always hesitated with the Lamb and Porchetta.  I have not tried the Kangaroo (which is available on Amazon), but I may buy a bag just so I can know how it is for future reference, and I can offer a review.<br /><br />As for the price, yes, it's a little on the higher side.  At $17.00 for a four-pound bag, I would try it for a couple weeks and make sure your dog does well (enough) on it before investing in a regular diet regimen of this dog food.  For me, though, the results I received did not justify me having to spend the extra money for this dog food, even though my dog actually liked eating it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Apparently it tastes very good.<br />2. Good ingredients.<br />3. High protein content (good).<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Pricey.<br />2. High protein content (bad).

review/summary: My dog loved it.
review/text: While I've found some canned food (& Addiction's dehydrated varieties) that my dog loves, I'd never found a dry food that she seemed to be interested in except when she was finally starving. But when I first received this product, she cleaned her bowl & asked for more. (Note that she did not have this reaction with Addiction's Kangaroo & Apple; just the Venison). Had never seen anything like it. And while her initial reaction has mellowed a bit, she obviously still enjoys it (she just likes the Addiction dehydrated version better - - I alternate days, so on days when she gets the dry it takes her a while to realize that's all she's getting that day; when she realizes the dehydrated isn't coming, she still enjoys the dry). I'm going to try one other Addiction dry (the Salmon, as she has really dry skin & the omega fatty acids might help), but I'll come back to this as an option too.

review/text: It's nice to have an instant coffee product you can carry with you in the car or in a bag. Also hard to find an instant coffee beverage with creamer and sugar added. The directions say use 4 to 6 ounces of water. 6 ounces makes a week cup of coffee. If you like a mug of coffee you'll need 2 packs. This is Trader Joe's Brand and found out it's $4.50 cheaper per box if you actually go to Trader Joe's.

review/summary: Brought my older pup back to life!
review/text: After feeding my dogs what I THOUGHT was a "Premium Brand" food: (Iams Healthy Natural), and paying for that as well, I stumbled upon this website: [...]/ and found out how it was actually rated.  Much to my sadness, the Iams premium food that I had been paying so much for, was not only one of the WORST foods for my dogs, it was also probably contributing to the downfall of my older dogs health. She was slow and sluggish, and just didn't want to participate. At first, I thought that she was just old, and then I read about what I was feeding her, and her younger sibling. I was Horrified. Think of the movie "Super Size Me" -30 days and nothing but McD's for every meal) - Now compare this "movie diet" to a Dogs Diet. If that horrible Fast Food, did that much damage to the director, in a very short amount of time, then just imagine - what is a constant diet of poor grade dog food, doing to our furry family members?<br />That was when I figured out that, I was even paying more for the Iams as well! The Iams has a 17.5 pound bag for $21.87- that comes to $43.74 for 35 pounds! Premium Edge? Only $39.99 for a 35 pound bag, and, I don't have to go to a fancy food store either! Thanks to Amazon, it gets delivered for free, by my UPS guy, (he isn't too happy about it, but I remember this, at Christmas time, and really hot days when cold water and a snack is much needed).<br />Now, if you could actually SEE the difference in my dogs coat, her disposition and energy! Oh my goodness! It changed so much that, I even went so far as to order a book, on how to bake their doggie treats as well! From now on, they get nothing but REAL FOOD. My dogs are like my children, and I would NEVER feed my kids, all of that horrible  junk that some of those other foods are made from. In EVERY commercial, they (the dog food companies) spend millions to, lead you to believe that, you are buying the BEST - but in reality - some of the supermarket brands, are actually BETTER than the Iams food. I'm just upset that I was spending premium money on sub par food.<br />My advice: look up the brands on that website, look it over, and purchase the BEST food that YOU can afford, for YOUR dogs - my shelties don't eat much (some people can't afford premium food but at least get what you CAN afford, by the crude breakdown) - For Us,,, this works out to be a win win situation - I don't have to go to the store - my dogs are eating PHENOMENAL food, and they show it. All for the same price, (if not actually less) than the Iams Healthy Naturals.<br />I never thought that I would actually SEE the difference in my dogs, just from the food that they are being fed! All it took was, four weeks for my Older dog, to turn back the clock, and start acting like a younger dog - my other one that is only four - he was already acting like a pup, but at least I know now that, what he is eating, won't start aging him prematurely. I could not be happier, nor can I say enough about this incredible brand of food - Just look for "Premium Edge" (in ANY flavor).

review/summary: Dog Food Review
review/text: I have a 2.5 year old chocolate lab.  She had eaten Eukanuba her whole life.  After reading some dog food reviews (this is rated much higher) and finding this comparable price wise I decided to make the switch.  As with switching any food you should ween the dog off the old food by adding a mixture of the old and new or you will have a MESS.  She loves this food much more than the Eukanuba.  I would have rated the product 5 star but this food does give her awful gas (due to higher protein content, I think) and her breathe doesn't smell the best.  I've been able to combat the breath with "fresh breath" dog treats.  The gas can be helped, not solved, by an assortment of candles, sprays, etc.  I will continue to buy this food and have it delivered to my house via Amazon.  Loving this setup.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have since switched to Purina One Healthy Weight.  Lab ended up gaining weight during the time she ate this food.  Has since lost 4 pounds in 3 weeks eating Purina One.  Not loving this setup anymore.

The Peanut butter filling has a nice sweet/salty balance that does not leave a gritty aftertaste on your tongue. While the White Chocolate is rich & smooth as it melts in your mouth. A fairly unique taste & better than some of the more pricier brands. When your trying to watch your weight, but have a burning need for something sweet a couple of these miniatures will hit the spot without expanding ones spare tire.

review/text: I'm a chocolate Reese's fan. I love white chocolate but not on the Reese's. After a while of eating 2 or 3, I began to taste the heavy syrup that is part of the ingredients on the white chocolate. I was disgusted after tasting syrup flavored chocolate. Instead of throwing them out I just ate the bottom part of the cups just to avoid the blotch of white chocolate on top of the peanut butter cup. I will definitely stick to the regular ones next time. I would recommend the White Kitkats.<br /><br />Packaging: I like the fact that these are small peanut butter cups because once I get back from the gym, I pat myself with 2 Reese's peanut butter cups, instead of having to eat a whole giant peanut butter Reese's. :)

review/text: I am a big white chocolate fan, my favorite candy bars have always been Hershey's Cookies n Creme and Halloween Kit Kats (its a white chocolate kit kat with food coloring to make the chocolate look orange for Halloween) they used to be the only way you could find white ones so this Halloween I went to buy a bag and I couldn't find the white chocolate Kit Kats but I found these instead, and being a white chocolate fan I thought these would be amazing, I didn't have a lot of money on me so I only bought one bag- I am glad I only bought one bag, they weren't all that great. I don't think white chocolate goes all that well with peanut butter, honestly I think its like serving chicken and putting out beef gravy for your mashed potatoes in one meal, or pairing your meat with the wrong kind of wine. I found out they sell white kit kats now and its not just a seasonal thing so I have gone back to buying them and wont get these again.

I liked it so much, I asked my hostess, if it was homemade and if she could give me the recipe.  She told me that she bought it at a gourmet shop and the shop gets it around November/December time period.  Then while perusing on the internet, I found it on the Amazon site. Ever since then I have been buying it every year on Amazon. One 24 oz. for my family and couple of packages of 6 sample ones for gift giving.  It's almost becoming a tradition in my family.

Don't get me wrong, it is good, but not great or the best. When my husband & I went to Bermuda we bought rum cakes there and they were far superior. The Bermuda cakes seemed to have much more rum in them.

review/summary: Great for travel!
review/text: My dog is on a totally raw diet, which clearly presents challenges during travel.<br /><br />During a recent trip to Florida I took along a few bags of Stella and Chewy's steaks in lamb, beef and duck flavors.<br /><br />While you can feed the food dry, I opted to add a little water and rehydrate them.  While my dog had never eaten S&C food, he immediately took a liking to it, finished everything on his plate, and asked for more.<br /><br />IMO the real measure of how good a food is lies in what comes *out* of the dog, and this food totally agreed with his digestive system.  His stools were just as perfect eating S&C steaks as they were eating raw food.<br /><br />I will definitely keep Stella and Chewy's steaks on hand for those times when feeding raw food is impractical or impossible.<br /><br />If you're looking for an easy, practical and healthy solution for traveling/camping with your dog, Stella and Chewy's is it!

review/summary: Raw for dogs who will not eat frozen raw
review/text: My dog loves this food and all other flavors of the freeze dried Stella and Chewy's.  He would never eat the frozen patties, but for five or six months I've been buying these freeze dried patties and it has worked out great.  I just wish that they had larger bags, like three pound bags, to make this more affordable for people with large active dogs, like mine.  I wish I could make it his total diet, but that would cost me about $400 or more a month to do that, and I'm sort of poor.  I buy it in bulk from somone who advertises on amazon for about $21 per bag when I buy six large bags or more + a coupon.<br /><br />This is great raw food.<br /><br />This is what vet's should be selling.  Not Science Diet.

review/summary: Healthy food for fussy ones!!
review/text: My spoiled-rotten Chinese Crested is the fussiest eater alive (or perhaps just smarter than Mom & is holding out for people food).  I've had a tough time finding food she likes...but she ADORES Stella & Chewy's.  At first I tried re-hydrating it & she seemed a bit nonplussed, but one day I crumbled it in her dish & gave it to her dry...success!!!  She snarfs it down.  She also loves the freeze dried canine kisses from S&C, so she acts like she's getting a treat every time I feed her.  Love this stuff!!!

review/summary: wow my dogs really approved
review/text: I could not believe how much all three of my Greyhounds loved this item. I gave it a try but I did not think it would go over. Well no more canned food as they wait to get this put into their regular dry food to give more umph.  Could not afford to feed it to three large dogs alone but as a supplement it goes along fine and I really like the product alot!

review/summary: Great as a way to spice up your kibble meals!
review/text: The patties are dense and dry, not difficult to crumble up but definitely hold their shape. I tend to crumble these and add pieces on top of kibble meals for my pups occasionally as a way to keep them interested. As soon as they notice me crumbling up the patties, they start dancing! Definitely see them pick pieces of this dehydrated raw out of their bowls before they eat their kibble, so it's definitely preferred by them. The price point is too high for me to consider feeding these alone, since I've got three hungry pups. No stomach issues at all. These would be great for us to pack as a snack for pups on hikes, since they're light-weight and nutritionally dense.
