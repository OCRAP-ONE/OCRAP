review/summary: I absolutely love this syrup -- and that other too.
review/text: I'm no maple syrup expert but I've been using maple syrup grade B for a number of years and I absolutely love the Coombs Family Farms one. It's thick, rich and complex. I like it with yogurt, pancakes, fruit, lemonade, in cooking, and even by the shot. However, after reading about maple country and maple syrup culture, I toyed with the romantic idea of buying directly from maple syrup makers. I recently was able to do that. I ordered a gallon of maple syrup grade B from Bear Mountain Vermont Maple (that's the place I chose after some research). Their sugar bush is in a remote mountain that borders Quebec and has never been farmed. Although the syrup is not certified organic, no pesticides or insecticides are used anywhere in the area. These are really nice, honest people and it was a great experience ordering from them. The syrup is great. And the price is good too: 1 gallon is $60 (including shipping) and is shipped in two half-gallon BPA-free containers that have an oxygen barrier coating on the outside to help the syrup stay fresh longer. The service was fast too. I got the shipment just 4 days after I placed my order (I live in Northern California). So yes, I'm really satisfied. I am not ready to say that I prefer this syrup to Coombs Family Farms'. They're both really good in my opinion. But ordering from Bear Mountain was more like getting my produce from a farmer's market kind of experience for me.

review/text: I am into maple syrup.  I can tell the difference in different grades of syrup.  I love the sweet taste of this syrup.  Some syrups are very thin like water.  This is not, it has a nice consistency to it, but not thick.  I put syrup on everything.  I add syrup to my oatmeal, my tea, my homemade salad dressings.  I use this instead of sugar.  I would recommend this to anyone the flavor is great.  Don't hesitate to buy it.

review/summary: Grade B so much better than Grade A - who knew?
review/text: One of the other reviewers explained how Grade B Maple Syrup means that it has gone through the refinement process twice instead of once as Grade A does.  It's so much thicker and mapleier than the Grade A I'm used to buying from stores here in Oregon, that I will never buy Grade A again; plus it's a great bargain, especially on the repeating plan here at Amazon.

I did a bit of research in my goal to find a fair priced, 100% maple syrup. I settled on this one, and we have been so happy with it! When we serve it with company,  they seem to love it also.

review/summary: Sweet Addition to my Organic Kitchen
review/text: Having spent the last couple of years working toward a whole foods and organic diet we still need a few more things.  Sometimes the price is very prohibitive, and we still don't know if it's worth the cost.  After looking at the reviews on this product, I went for it.  I'm very glad I did.  Making my own cheap version of maple syrup might do in a pinch, but it will never replace the great taste of this syrup and I will definitely buy it again.  I like the fact that if you must have sweets, something a bit more pure is well worth it.  Especially when it comes to children.  My little toddler grandson was very ill, including an emergency ambulance ride to the local hospital.  We had great difficulty feeding him anything.  I used a loaf of soaked grain bread to make an egg/milk mixture of baked french toast casserole.  Of course I topped it off with this great syrup.  Everyone was amazed that I helped him get his appetite back, but really, after the third plate, I think it was the syrup that did it.  Just a light drizzle swirled over the top made it perfect.  The only thing I would change about this is if I could buy it in a 20 gallon bucket.

review/text: This syrup is delicious!  I've never tried the grade B, but I wasn't disappointed.  It has a full, rich, mapley flavor and is wonderful on pancakes, waffles, and as a replacement for sugar in muffins, sweet breads and cookies. You only need to use a small amount on pancakes and waffles because it is so sweet.  Knowing that it is organic puts my mind at ease because I know there is no formaldehyde in it, as there can be in other maple syrups.

review/text: I thought I new what good Maple Syrup tasted like.  I was never too impressed with the brands we found in our local grocery stores. This is much thicker and has a stronger maple flavor.  One reviewer said it has more minerals than grade A.  That could account for the more complex flavor.  Perhaps it is because it is organic.  I am sold on this brand.  I was hesitant to buy online because of reviewers saying the caps cracked causing leaks. Since it now comes with Frustration free packaging I do not have to worry about that anymore.  I am a believer!

review/text: This maple syrup tastes very maple-y and I really love it. It's not as "thick" as some Grade-B syrups out there, but the flavor is just fantastic. I find I have to use less of it on pancakes/french toast because it has such a nice sweetness and flavor - this is a plus since all maple syrup is basically just sugar and using less is good for me. I prefer the Grade-B because it has a deeper maple flavor than Grade-A.

review/summary: The sweetest of the 3 I've tried
review/text: This is a good quality syrup and my least favorite of the 3 I've tried.  It is very sweet when compared with the other 2 that I've tried.  I typically don't like things very sweet.  If you like sweetness, this one is for you.  This may be a good syrup to use if you want to put in less syrup in your Master Cleanse lemonades in order to cut calories.  I used 3 syrups listed below for my Master Cleanse.  They are all good quality and I'd recommend any of them.  You probably will want 1 jug for every 5 days of a cleanse.  It is possible that you'll need more.  I'm not an expert to comment on darkness or many other factors.  Here's my brief breakdown:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - The sweetest of the 3 for sure.  It is also probably the thickest but still runny.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  When I put this in my lemonade for the Master Cleanse, it makes the lemonade sweeter than how I like it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ENHSC8">NOW Foods Maple Syrup Grade B Organic, 32 ounce</a> - Is less sweet when compared to Coombs but a little sweeter than Family Heritage.  Runnier than Coombs but these syrups are all a little runnier than grocery syrups.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  It provided the right amount of sweetness for the Master Cleanse specifications for a drink.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248E980">Family Heritage Organic Vermont Maple Syrup, Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - Good quality and tastes sweet but definitely not as sweet as the other 2.  Didn't get the calorie info before throwing the bottle away but I'm figuring it's the same as the other 2.  I usually put an extra 1/2 a tbsp in my master cleanse lemonade to get it a little sweeter and curb the hunger.

review/summary: Our family's No. 1 maple syrup
review/text: Our large family loves maple syrup and we have purchased this brand regularly for years.  We prefer Grade B over Grade A because Grade B has a stronger maple flavor, but Coombs makes excellent Grade A syrups for those who prefer their syrup a little "lighter."  This syrup is organic, which we purchase whenever we can afford it, but Coombs also makes delicious non-organic syrups that are slightly lower in price and just as yummy.<br /><br />Pros: This size is good for our family, and a much better value than the tiny little glass bottles in health food stores that cost a fortune.  The jug is easy to pour from and doesn't make a huge mess.  The flavor is great and works well in all applications: topping for waffles or pancakes, making salad dressings or barbeque sauces, baking cornbread or muffins.  I also love that the product is certified organic...when I am not buying locally and cannot personally speak to the farmers producing my food I feel more confident buying certified organic stuff.<br /><br />Cons: Obviously, this is slightly higher in price than non-organic maple syrup but not by much.  I would also love to see this available in half gallon or gallon sizes.

review/summary: grade b is my favorite!
review/text: Worth the price for a great tasting, sweet, and healthful food. I bought twice in Amazon and both times it shipped quick, and was packaged well, with a tight thick seal. Grade b is the thickest, darkest, and sweetest, with a earthy caramel, molasses taste to it. It is relatively high on the glycemic index, giving health enthusiasts plenty of energy before a sport. It also has plenty of iron, and I think plenty of manganese as well, and is beneficial for reproductive health at least in men. I use it every morning in my oats or 'kashi' whole wheat biscuits, mixed into cowmilk or soymilk. I recommend this product.

review/summary: Grade B maple syrup rocks!
review/text: Coombs Family Farms grade B maple syrup is our favorite maple syrup. It has a more intense maple flavor than grade A, in our opinion. We use it in recipes such as broiled salmon, stir fried foods, cookie recipes, and homemade ice cream. Compared to the grocery store prices, Coombs Family Farms maple syrup is a bargain even with shipping costs. And it comes in cute little jugs that pour neatly.

review/text: Coombs Family Farms Organic Maple Syrup is the best on the market. Sweet, clear and smooth. Amazon's price beats the local Health Food Store every time. I stock up on this and use it as a lovely sweetener with a nice flavor twist. Stores great on the shelf, but put it in the fridge after opening. Keeps well in the fridge too.

review/summary: Staple
review/text: Wonderful flavor. Grade B is richer and darker than Grade A which is lighter tasting. The price on Amazon is comparable to non-organic elsewhere. We never use the grocery store type syrups as they are mainly sugar. This must be kept refrigerated.<br /><br />I often make cleansing drinks either with raw organic apple cider vinegar mixed with a bit of maple syrup or the lemon (I usually use key limes or limes as I like them better than lemons), cayenne pepper and maple syrup recipe that many use for cleanses (master cleanse). So many micro-nutrients, and now that the honey supply is in question with honey bee shortage (see Dr. Mercola's recent article that 75% of our honey is actually a product coming from China, including that in big box stores)maple syrup is even more immportant to us as I am not comfortable buying honey.

review/text: After a lifetime of mediocre maple syrup, this is the perfect one.  Compared to Grade A, he Grade B has the heartier flavor which works perfectly for waffles and pancakes.  The amber color and consistency of the syrup are also just right for the breakfast table.  The organic designation, though nice, is not a personal requirement given that the product comes from the sap of trees, which really should not require herbicides anyway.  The price for this product, given the volume you are getting is almost 50% cheaper than buying something similar at your grocery store.  A must have for breakfast.

review/text: I grew up eating "pancake syrup", not true maple syrup. Quite a few years ago a friend had mentioned to me how maple syrup is so much better. I bought the smallest bottle I could find at the store and I thought it tasted horrible and went back to my pancake syrup. This time I actually purchased this to use with the Master Cleanse. I haven't started it yet but decided to give this a try with some pancakes. Wow, I was pleasantly surprised. This actually tastes pretty good. It has a thin consistency though. Maybe because I'm so used to my pancake syrup that is thicker. Either way, I really liked this and I will order more in the future.

review/summary: Awesome Coffee for the Money Spent!
review/text: This is my first try at Maxwell House coffee and I'm glad to say that it was an excellent experience! They had this on sale at my local grocery store for about $4.99 a can so Amazon is a little cheaper in that area but I didn't want to buy a pack of 3 not knowing what I was getting into. I'm not really a coffee snob (nor a coffee expert, mind you) but just for the heck of it, I love to try different brands of coffee and try not to stick with one no matter how good it tastes.<br /><br />This Maxwell House Original blend smells really good and doesn't lack in flavor. My first sip of this coffee instantly reminded me of Yuban Colombian coffee. I actually got addicted to coffee because of Yuban and surprisingly, Maxwell House Original blend closely resembles it, which is a good thing although Yuban is stronger. I'm not sure what kind of beans is used here but if my taste buds are correct, I'll go with some type of Colombian beans.<br /><br />I made this coffee using a Black and Decker Brew N' Go machine, a single cup Melitta filter and a Bodum french press. Each cup came out awesome except for one very weird thing. The cup of coffee starts out really good but then towards the later half or so, it starts to decrease in flavor. I'm using the suggested 1 tablespoon of coffee grinds for every 6oz of water (I usually drink 12oz at a time so I use 2 tablespoon) so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.<br /><br />Another thing I love is that the coffee can comes with a flavor lock lid. It's too early for me to tell if this lid truly does help preserve the coffee grinds over time so it will be interesting to test this out. All in all, this is a good coffee product and I now want to try the Maxwell House French Roast because it seems that one is the more popular product.

review/summary: The only truely no-carb sweetener.
review/text: Saccharine has gotten a bad rap over the years. What the manufacturers of other newer sweeteners won't tell you is that while their products may be saccharine free, they aren't sugar free: each of their blue or yellow packets contain a gram of carb, usually in the form of dextrose. Give me plain 0l' saccharine tablets, thank you. I agree with others that the mailing price is ridiculous, but "the other leading brands" have so successfully demonized saccharine (and duped diabetics into taking unnecessary carbs) that it's unavailable anywhere but on-line.

review/summary: Necta Sweet Sugar?  Would you like one tablet or two?
review/text: I had been searching the local grocery stores for these necta sweet tablets for quite some time.  Unable to find necta sweet within the local area, I decided to search the internet.  I was very pleased to find this product at amazon.com.  It was very easy to place an order and it arrived very quickly.  I make a gallon of iced each day and sweeten the tea with these saccharin tablets.  I bring a full 2 quart pan of water to a boil and when it reaches a boil, I turn off the burner and then add 6 teabags.  I dip the teabags in the water exactly six times and then add 8 tablets of necta sweet saccharin tablets.  The tea then steeps for about five minutes and then is poured into a gallon pitcher.  I then add cold water to fill it up to the gallon mark and stir.  The necta sweet tablets are the best!<br />The tablets dissolve quickly, the flavor is great (no after taste)!  This is as close to making my grandma's sun-tea as it gets.  I drink iced tea all year round like other folks drink coffee, and cutting back on sugar intake is a must.  Necta sweet is a great product, so if you are using it now, keep using it.  And, if you haven't tried it yet, you should try it.  You will probably like it as much as I do!

If you want more of an organic kick ginger candy purchase Newsman's ginger in the tin-I think it has more kick than the same in the individual rolls and currently is my favorite ginger candy. Ditto for Newman's wintergreen flavor. What I did like about this brand is each piece is individually wrapped and packaged in 6 bags. I think it will be handy during flu/cold season since it is mild and would soothe the throat. I like it well enough to continue my subscribe and save subscription.

review/text: I love ginger, and love ginger candies, cookies, treats, etc.  However, this hard candy is way off the mark.  The taste is uninspiring and bland, with not enough ginger zing to it.  Too watered down for my ginger tastes.

review/summary: pleasant tasting but I expected more "kick"
review/text: These taste very good but the ginger flavor was too weak. I want more intense and full-bodied flavor -- especially considering how expensive this is. I won't be purchasing again unless it's 1.75 per bag. I'm on a budget and would rather save money for real ginger.

review/summary: Awesome Ginger Candies!!!
review/text: I was amazed at the quick delivery time, and after trying one, very pleasantly happy with the intense flavour of these ginger candies.  Just like I first experienced in Tennessee for the first time last year. My grandson who loves extremely flavourful foods, totally loved these candies and he was ecstatic when I showed him my 'loot'.  I will definitely be ordering these on a regular basis - for myself & family.  Also, they are great for indigestion!!  I'm looking forward to placing an order for some of the other GoNaturally Organic Gluten Free Hard Candies in different flavours.  Thank you for the great product & excellent service.

review/text: I purchased this hard candy because I had read that eating ginger candy can help with an upset stomache and I thought it would help me feel better. I found that I dont like the taste of this candy and will be eating it sparingly. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth and just is not appealing.

Unfortunately, I found this on a search for "sugar-free candy" and the cane juice and brown rice syrup means that I feel mislead and resentful.  Amazon needs to fix its page in some way so this product does not come up on that search.  Of course, I should read product pages more carefully.

review/summary: A cut above your average K-cup
review/text: Yes, they cost more but they're worth it. I've had a Keurig for 4 years now and have tried just about everything in a quest to find a k cup that would deliver an experience on par with freshly ground and brewed coffee.  These may not be 100% of the way there but they're very close and nothing else is even in the same ballpark.  I've tried both the Italian blend and the House Blend and really like both.  My coffee tastes run toward the Extra Bold and Dark end of the spectrum and I've tried, Jet Fuel, Black Tiger and any number of the other cups that have a reputation for strong, bold flavor.  While I've found a few that I like, the Barista Prima is ahead of them all by a fairly large margin.  This tastes like coffee is supposed to taste and has the mouth feel to go along with it for a change.  I had resigned myself to the fact that I was never going to get a cup from my Keurig that went beyond "decent".  I'm happy to report that I find the the Barista Prima Kcups falling somewhere between  good plus and great minus.<br /><br />These are worth your time and money if you've found yourself longing for something a bit more out of your keurig machine. I hope they expand their selection because I would love to taste what else these guys can come up with.  Premium product all the way.<br /><br />As a general cup of coffee I'd give these 4 stars. For a Keuring cup of coffee, these are a 5 star product.

review/summary: Rich but not too strong--by far, the best Barista I've tried
review/text: I had a sampler and tried Italian Roast, Columbian, House Blend and a few other Barista blends. By far, the House Blend is my favorite. It's dark but not burnt, not overly strong and it has character. It stands up to milk and sugar but is pleasant when drunk black. Of all the coffees I've tried in the Keurig, this one is by far the best. It's balanced and hearty.

review/summary: I Absolutely Love It
review/text: This is most definitely my favorite regular coffee K-cup (at this time).  I would agree with their text that states complex and perfectly blended.  The claim is that this is a premium line for those who expect a premium coffee more like a coffee shop.  I tend to agree, except you just don't get as much per cup.  I absolutely love the house blend, which matches my preference for medium or medium-dark house blend roasts from coffee shops, but not the very dark roast of Starbucks.  I really feel this is a complex blend that has well more than one note.  Most importantly, it doesn't taste burnt like a dark french roast.<br /><br />I have tried so many K-cup flavors, most of which I liked at varied degrees with a few exceptions, but this one is currently my favorite.  What is nice about K-cups is you can easy switch blends per cup or over time without having to exhaust a whole bag of beans or grounds before moving on.  And preferences change as you have the same day in and day out.  So I can say that at present, I absolutely love it over previous favorites (of non-flavored) which in descending order of current preference are: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGPK">Wolfgang Puck Chef's Reserve Colombian</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Dark Magic</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045IO37Y">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1GFN2">Caribou</a>, and a number of other decent ones.  I am just saying I prefer this over those right now.  But I will still have the others for variety.  Within this variety, I really like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLIL6Q">Barista Prima Colombia</a> second and ahead of the rest.<br /><br />The Barista Prima tends to be more expensive, and depending on the sale price, can be only a little more expensive than other varieties.  For a little bit more, it is worth it to me.  For a lot more, maybe not.  Paying about 12% more yields about 30% more in value in flavor to me.  But paying 50% more is costly when there other flavors are plenty good too.

We normally use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Donut Shop K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> (we have them on "subscribe and save"), but this "House Blend" coffee is generally superior tasting and provides a nice caffeine lift in the morning.<br /><br />The premium price will keep this from becoming my regular daily coffee, but it is good enough to keep on hand for guests or when I want to spoil myself a little.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: It's hard to describe this to people who have never sampled it, but basically it's a powder to which you mix milk and sugar to get a sweetened malted drink. It is supposed to promote sleep.<br /><br />Quite simply it's a comfort drink when plain milk just won't do. You can also call it malted milk or a hot sweet malt drink.<br /><br />In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks is the most malty, Milo is the medium chocolatey and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolatey. It's actually named after the inventor, William Horlick.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, you can make it as malty or sweet as you like depending on how much of each you add to the milk. But to those who love and grew up on Horlicks, it's just a great comfort drink.<br /><br />This is supposed to be 2lbs worth of Horlicks, so just make sure you like it before you buy this one!

review/text: I was shocked to see how small the bottle was. And it was $9.99, I couldn't believe how expensive it is. But neverthless I loved the taste of it. And even more strange thing is I was having trouble sleeping, and after I had it over the night, I slept 8 hrs. I don't know if that's real but I personally slept really good after drinking it. Maybe it brought time back to my childhood days of no worries and high hopes when the world looked so great. Overall it's a nice drink which is healthy and a replacement drink for chocolate drink once in a while. Great product but yeah over priced.

review/summary: Not sure about this one.
review/text: I've been to England and the bed and breakfast place we stayed in included packets of Horlicks for night time beverages.  I loved drinking it right before bed, not sure it helped me sleep any better, I just liked the warm beverage before bed.  I brought some back with me from England, but have since used it up and I wanted to get some more.  I was very happy that Amazon had it.<br /><br />But ... I haven't tried this version yet.  On the packets that we used in the UK and the containers I brought back, all of them on the front had the "Just add water".  The container I received had "Just add milk" on the front.  I was aware that there were different versions of this mix, but I relied on the product picture informing me what version I purchased.  I drink milk very rarely as I am lactose intolerant and thus don't keep milk in the house.  Now I'll have to try this with water and hope it tastes the same as the other version.

review/summary: Delish herbal blend, brews stronger than with a tea bag
review/text: It seems a bit wasteful to me to brew Vue Cup tea, because you can draw off a cup of water from 4 to 18 oz and make a mug of tea any way you like with a tea bag. But when you are entertaining in an office or a setting (an open house?) where you don't want to deal with drippy tea bags, this is a great thing. That's why I put up five stars.<br /><br />The tea is a mix of chamomile, linden (aka tilia or lime blossom) and spearmint and is one of my favorite blends from Celestial Seasonings. I am NEVER without a box of this tea at home and both my late husband and I always had a cup of this after dinner. We used to live overseas in Germany, and a glass of chamomile was a frequent end to what could be a pretty heavy dinner if you ate out (home dinners in Germany tended to be light snacks, easier on the tummy and healthier, I think.) So we were in the habit of enjoying a cup of herb tea as a digestif after meals. I usually have a cup after dinner as this tea is so delicious, soothing yet refreshing. If you have acid reflux, mint can be problematical for some people, but it doesn't seem to bother me, whereas peppermint tea, our other favorite, is somewhat irritating. And the very scent, which is sweet and floral, often helps me sleep.<br /><br />The brew in the VUE comes out stronger than with bag tea. I made it up on several volume and temperature settings, settling on 10 oz and 184 degrees and it still was a darker amber than I brew when I make a cup with a bag. The taste is great and one advantage is that if you pour boiling water from a kettle into a mug, the tea is often way to hot to drink for quite some time. The VUE really does brew at just the right temperature for drinking. If you are addicted to using the VUE (it is a very fun brewer to play with, I'll admit that) you'd want to keep a box of this on hand for guests or just for yourself, you like herbal teas.

review/summary: Cat that NEVER vomited has been vomiting daily since formula change
review/text: This used to be one of the relatively few "urinary tract" formulas out there that my cat could stomach AND was readily available at most super markets but since the recent formula change, he has been throwing up nearly every day and has started turning his nose to it. It's pretty awful and kind of scary to see him lose half of his "nourishment" every day of late. This was something he had been eating every year for the last decade (half mixed with a high-end catfood that is only meat and poultry and none of the grains and corn crap that is so bad for humans and completely counter to what cats naturally eat!).  So now I am at a loss.  I wish there was a grocer's catfood out there on the store shelves that is all meat and poultry, no sugars, no grains and no corn and has the urinary tract ingredients for these little creatures that have this problem.  I wonder if just feeding him the food he would be eating in the wild would change things around--even for the urinary tract complications...anyway, the Purina Urinary Tract Formula is no longer any good.

review/summary: Caution: Made my cat very sick!!
review/text: I've been feeding my cat this food for years without a problem. Recently she began vomiting uncontrollably after eating the food. Around her feeding time, she was at her bowl crying an begging for food like she usually does, but when we fed her she refused to touch the stuff. We thought maybe she just didn't have an appetite because she wasn't feeling well, but she scarfed down the treats and tuna we gave her. That was when we started to suspect that something was wrong with the food. We went out and bought her some canned food, and she ate that too. The only thing she wouldn't touch was the Purina food that she had eaten for years. She also stopped throwing up after we switched her food. After that, I turned to google to see if there were any recalls. I didn't find any, but I did find numerous complaints on the consumeraffairs dot com about cats (and dogs...apparently the problem isn't limited to cat food) who have recently gotten sick from Purina food. I would NOT buy this food. I have already stopped feeding it to my own cats, and I would suggest that everyone else do the same.<br /><br />If you pet has already gotten sick from the food, call this number to complain. 1-866-787-4621

review/summary: ~*~*~NO MORE URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS~*~*~
review/text: My cat is 10 years old and he used to get UTI's ALL the time(like every few months) not only was his vet bills expensive, I hated that he was in pain. I used the very expensive food I bought from the vet for cats who get lots of UTI's but since I am not Donald Trump I decided to give the Purina One Urinary Tract food a try. For years my cat didn't have a single UTI so one day at the store when they were out of the Purina One, I decided to give a cheaper Urinary Tract cat food a try. Within a month my cat was whining in the litter box and I knew he had another UTI. I took him to the Vet and sure enough, he had another UTI.<br /><br />I immediately went to the store and bought him Purina One Urinary Tract and that is what he has been on ever since. I will NEVER again try a different brand of cat food, that was over 4 years ago since I tried the cheaper cat food and he hasn't had a single UTI since. My cat LOVES his food, he is very picky but thankfully he loves his UTI formula.<br /><br />If you have a cat who gets UTI's I totally recommend giving this food a try. It costs more than the cheaper food but what it saves me in vet bills and having a happy & healthy Kitty is well worth it : )

review/summary: A decent price and quality
review/text: Its been almost a month since I switched my two cats over from Meow Mix to Purina Sensitive System. Both of them love it, and the older of the two cats has significantly vomited less after eating this food.<br /><br />I came to realize the poor quality of ingredients in Meow Mix, and hoped to find a better quality food for a good price, but its no surprise to me that even a good bag of dry cat food has some undesirable ingredients (corn gluten meal, chicken by-product, etc.) and its almost impossible to find anything of high quality without those ingredients and still be paying a decent price for it. The 3.5 lb bags I get at Target are about $6.00. Not too expensive, and the bag lasts my two cats a little over a month.<br /><br />Although Purina Sensitive Systems isn't the best ever, its not the poorest either. It falls just in the middle, and I'd recommend it to those who can only afford an inexpensive dry cat food, but with better quality than the cheaper Meow Mix brands.

review/summary: Much Healthier Cats Since Switching
review/text: I have two cats with chronic problems. Marci had chronic diarrhea. I took her to the Texas A&M pet clinic. Several tests were run to identify the cause. None of the tests results identified any problems. After I switched to Purina One, her diarrhea cleared with no recurring problems.<br /><br />My other cat, Beauty-Bells, suffered from recurring urinary tract infections. She has not one since eating Purina One. I have not had to buy the formula for urinary tract infections. The regular Purina One formulas have been sufficient.<br /><br />Being on a tight budget with 8 cats, I had long hesitated to switch to food that is so much more expensive. My cats actually eat less. They are also much healthier with shiny, soft coats and more energy. I switched 3 kittens to Purina one and the differences in health were obvious much quicker than with the older cats. I keep threatening to put them on cheaper food because they are tearing up my house with all the energy they have! Of course, I them to much to do that!<br /><br />The switch has been well worth it. Being so happy and amazed with results, I don't think I'll ever feed them anything else.

review/summary: Purina One Sensitive - great for a cat with digestion trouble
review/text: We recently took in a cat that could not keep any food down.  She would throw up multiple times a day, usually within an hour or so of eating.  We thought she may be overeating, so we limited how much food we gave her, we tried to spread out the food to force her to breath and chew between pieces.  We tried many different foods, including multiple foods recommended by the vet.  After a lot of money spent on vet visits and tests, with the vet finding nothing wrong with her, I saw this food and figured trying a food for sensitive systems couldn't hurt.<br /><br />We'd already tried other Purina One formulas without success, so we weren't particularly optimistic, but hopeful.  Our cat has been eating this for about two or three weeks now and she has not thrown up at all.  I love this food, it was hard to watch her throw up so much, and, frankly, it wasn't pleasant cleaning it up so frequently.  I'm glad I found this and fully recommend it to anyone with a cat with similar problems keeping food down.

review/summary: Inexpensive But Still Healthful
review/text: I have 4 cats, so I can't afford to splurge on their food.  And sometimes they don't all like one product, and that doesn't work for me.  This kibble is liked by all 4 cats and seems more healthful than some of the less expensive brands.  Good luck pleasing your cats!
