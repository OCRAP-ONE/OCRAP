review/summary: OK, but not great
review/text: I live near Seattle and have drunk "Pike's Place Roast" at the Pike's Place location many times. So I know what a good cup of it tastes like. I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.<br /><br />The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a "Bold" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special. To my tastes, there are plenty of better k-cups for less money. Not worth the extra cost and a little on the weak side. I'm giving it three stars, but 2.5 stars would be about right.

Don't waste your money on these.  A friend picked up some and I tried them, while they aren't bad, they certainly aren't worth twice the price as the equally good coffee produced by several other K-Cup brands.

review/summary: suspicious
review/text: I'm not sure what happened, but my box of "54 k-cups" only had 52 cups in it.  There was no packaging inside the box to hold the k-cups in place and protect them, they were just laying in the box loosely.  Some of the cups in the box were also damaged, probably due to the lack of packaging in the box.  This is not the quality anyone would expect from companies such as Keurig and Starbucks!  I suspect the box has been opened previously.  I do not know what happened on the sellers end, but what they sent out was not an original new package of keurig k-cups!  The cups seem to be authentic, but it is hard to tell since the packaging was not up to par and even though the box was sealed, it is looks like the box has been opened previously.  The product I received was sold by "BECCO CORP" through amazon.

review/summary: Mediocre Flavor & Brew, Not StarBucks Quality!
review/text: In 2011, when StarBucks broke away from Tassimo Bosch over a contractual dispute, I was completely disappointed, and wondered<br />what other Options were going to be available, in the meantime, I purchased a warehouse supply of StarBuck's Coffee & Cappuccino and<br />started researching a New Coffee Machine, and then ... in November, I found out that Starbucks was offering the "K-Cup" Version, for the Keurig Coffee machines. I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances.<br />When I returned back in this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />* Pike Place + Colombian + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.<br />  The Colombian was the Best of the lot.<br /><br />Read my comments, after each bullet item:<br /><br />  * Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about<br />  2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig "Brew" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!

review/summary: Complete Sauce for Pasta
review/text: This bag of dehydrated vegetables and spices makes the tastiest linguine alla puttanesca traditional southern Italian pasta sauce I have ever had. The great thing is that all these vegetables were grown in southern Italy and they are tasty. Made with chunks of real vegetables and spices and perfectly proportioned. All I did was add the mix to about 1 cup of boiling water in a sauce pan, let the mix reconstitute and absorb all the water.  I then added some olive oil, saute'd for about 2-3 minutes, added some tomatoes or whole peeled tomatoes, and cooked it down for about 15-20 minutes.  I served it with nothing else added to linguine cooked seaparately in a large pot of boiling water.  And that was it!  I didn't need to buy any other ingredient.  It tasted like what I had in Sorrento when I was there a couple of summers ago.  I highly recommed this dish.

The tea has all natural ingredients, such as hibiscus, rosehips, blueberry leaves, wild blueberries.  It has no caffeine, sodium, sugars, or calories.  True Blueberry tea is soothing when hot and refreshing when cold, and has a pleasing blueberry taste.  I recommend this tea.

review/summary: Taste great, but super sticky!
review/text: I love the taste of these granola bars, and the fact that they are at least a somewhat healthy snack.  That being said though, I don't know if it's only the pack that we got or not, but it's like all the sticky, syrupy goo that would normally be in the bar has coagulated at the bottom of the bar.  It is difficult to get out of the package because of this and it gets your hands sticky trying to eat it.  I didn't buy these for my kids, but they always want some of what I'm eating, and I hesitate to hand them any because it's so messy.  A snack that requires me to wash my hands when I'm done with it isn't what I'm looking for when I grab a quick snack-to-go as I'm heading out the door.  If it weren't for the stickiness issue, I'd give them a 5 star rating.  Hopefully it's only the boxes that I received with this issue since the other reviews don't mention it.

review/text: These dark chocolate almond granola bars are quite delicious. On taste alone I would give them 5 out of 5.<br /><br />But, like previous reviewers, my bars are a syrupy, sticky kind of mess. Not extremely bad, but enough that you do want to wash your hands afterwards. Because it sticks to the packaging it is nearly impossible to not use your fingers to pry the gooey tastiness off the wrapper.<br /><br />So, again I agree with previous reviewers: this is not a grab, eat on the go snack. Unless you like sticky fingers.<br /><br />I definitely don't regret my purchase, especially because subscribe and save makes these bars that much cheaper!

review/text: I was a big fan of the Cascadian Farms Fruit & Nut Granola bars and was looking for a substitute since they mysteriously discontinued that flavor.  Loving dark chocolate, I thought the Dark Chocolate and Almond might just be the ticket. Now I don't mean to say these aren't good, it's just that I can't find the almonds.  I can't taste very much of them (a hint) and I certainly can't see them like the chunks one found in the Fruit and Nut bars. From that aspect these were disappointing and I probably won't order them again, but will just stick with the Harvest Berry bars.

review/summary: Do not feed these to your pet
review/text: My Lab LOVED these and got them as a treat every night before bed.  He just died from stomach cancer at age 9.  If you read the ingredients you will see that these contain PROPYLENE GLYCOL which is the chemical in car anti freeze.  Also contains BHA a preservative that has been shown to cause cancer. Our dog thought he was getting something special, but it was full of chemicals.<br /><br />I assumed from the label "Real Beef" that I was giving my Lab something tasty and good for him. Dog food companies care about money, NOT your pet. There is lots of  information on what they are putting in your dogs food and treats available on the internet. Become informed about what the ingredients really are. Don't be fooled by advertising gimmicks and the great packaging that makes stuff sound so healthy and delicious.<br /><br />I am on a mission in memory of my dog to let people know what is in these things. I can't say this product caused his cancer, but I will always regret giving him these chemical filled treats.<br /><br />Please give your pet natural food and treats for their health, and your peace of mind.

review/summary: Cookie in a cup
review/text: I have loved tea ever since I was a little girl, and I can honestly say that Celestial Seasonings has been one of my favorite whimsical brands of teas supporting my habit of drinking this healthful and delicious brew. I don't know anyone who can resist the cozy boxes with cheery, charming artwork pleasing to the eye, all printed on 100% recycled cardboard, with the tea bags being large and very plain as their taste once dropped in the hot water is worth the bag looking the way it does while the cover art on the box really make this a better tea than some of the brand out there in their fancy boxes and shiny labels, that taste flat and bitter.<br /><br />Madagascar Vanilla Red is a caffeine free blend of Rooibos, Natural French Vanilla Flavor and Vanilla bean. When sugar or honey or even milk are added it tastes like the sweetest, almost chewy vanilla one can sink their teeth into whenever a sweet craving kicks in. I swear it reminds me of the Madagascar Vanilla I use in all my baking for the intense and heady sweet aroma and it tastes like a bakery treaty in a cup and since it's healthy, easy to find and inexpensive it makes me a very satisfied customer. If I drink it plain, no sugar no nothing it tastes like a delicate exotic tea with a breath of sweetness, and this is one of the very few teas I can drink plain, quite a feat in my eyes.<br /><br />I heartily recommend it for any tea fan, even if they don't think that Herbal/Caffeine type teas are their cup of tea, haha, this is better because its not decaf, its naturally caffeine free, omitting the artificial process and it simply makes me happy when I drink it.

review/summary: Yummy vanilla flavor!  Plus Decaf!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by this rich flavorful tea. Some vanilla teas are thin and sickly in flavor--not this one!  Celestial Seasoning has managed to make a sweet--not cloying--rich tea mixture that brews up to a fragrant, comforting and enjoyable cup of tea--I add cream to round out the flavor.<br /><br />Rooibos is the base for this tea.  It is a healthy alternative to black teas because it is naturally caffeine-free and loaded with antioxidants--as much as green tea.  You can brew this tea for a long time and it will not get bitter because there are no tannins.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

review/summary: The tea that made me a tea drinker
review/text: Despite a foray into peppermint and chamomile tea as a youth (following my father's lead), I've never been an avid hot tea drinker. I read about this tea in Best Life magazine and decided to give it a try for the claimed health benefits of rooibos tea. Healthy or not, this tea is delicious. I drink at least two cups a day, plus a Thermos-ful at work. I prefer it with a shot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZ73E">Madhava Pure Organic Raw Agave Nectar</a>. It would be nice if I could get a caffeinated version, but I guess I'll have to stick to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMAZPO">Lipton Black Pearl Tea</a> for that.

What were once bugs are now drippy blobs smeared on the inside of the individual packages. I had to throw the entire bag away.  I'm sure the candy itself was fine, but something when pretty far wrong during the shipping.

review/summary: Fun to eat but very sweet!
review/text: Queen Anne Cordial Blueberries are a recent variation on the more familiar cordial cherries sold in drugstores and grocery stores.  Each chocolate candy contains a good-sized blueberry swimming in the liquid filling instead of a cherry.<br /><br />I have come to prefer the dark chocolate cherry cordials much more than the milk chocolate ones but these blueberry cordials are only available in milk chocolate so they are definitely very sweet!  They are best with a glass of milk or a cup of coffee or tea to go with them.  I enjoy the combination of the blueberry and chocolate and the liquid filling is fun to eat.  Children also like these if you are willing to share but the drips can be messy for the youngest ones.<br /><br />If you have never read about how they get the liquid center into the candy, it is quite interesting.  When they are made, the filling is solid and it becomes liquid over time because of the invertase, an enzyme that changes the sucrose into glucose and fructose.  Bees also use invertase to make honey from nectar.<br /><br />The 5.6 ounce (159 gram) box contains ten candies, each with 60 calories.  They are packed in two sealed trays which will help prevent you from eating all ten cordials at once.  I was worried by the "artificial flavored" label but it apparently refers to vanillin with the blueberry flavor being natural.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Sugar, milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, milk, chocolate, soya lecithin, PGPR, and vanillin), blueberries (blueberries, high fructose corn syrup, glycerol, citric acid, calcium lactate, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, natural blueberry flavor, pectin methyl esterase), corn syrup, dark coating (sugar, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oils) cocoa, chocolate, soya lecithin), invertase, artificial flavor.

review/text: I was extremely disappointed when these came.  As others mentioned, the price was outrageous, but my husband likes the cherries and we didn't have blueberries locally.  When they arrived, for $1 each, they were dry and lacked flavor.  I have enjoyed many varieties of chocolate fruits, some better than others, but I can honestly say these were THE WORST!  Don't waste your money.

review/summary: Oh WOW!
review/text: I was given a box of these for Christmas from a co-worker and was unsure at first. I've had the cherry cordials and have always been underwhelmed by them. I only have them at Christmas time and usually because they were given to me. The cherries have never impressed me. They're okay, but I usually pass the box around because I'm just not that into them. The Blueberries on the other hand...wow. They are sweet and juicy and oh so good. I didn't want to share them but I did because I wanted everyone to taste how wonderful they are. One girl was unsure, she said she didn't like plain blueberries, she only likes them in muffins and pancakes. Well I convinced her to try one and she was hooked too. If I could find these, I would buy them up in a heartbeat. I hope they aren't just a holiday item.

review/text: I tried these out for an option that my 9 month old with a wheat allergy could try...since there are not many finger foods for baby with a wheat allergy on the market.  I opened the box and noticed how big they were so I tried one myself and they are quite hard, so I broke 1 in 3rds and it took awhile for my baby to dissolve it in his mouth.  I would not recommend this as a first finger food and I am going to wait until my baby has molars also before I offer them to him again.  If your baby has a wheat allergy I suggest using Baby Mum Mums and yogurt melts (happy Baby has an organic brand) Also I have tried honey dew and cantalope as finger foods

review/text: I saw these in store and picked one up to try, I didn't see any obvious suggested age on the packaging so I thought they would be a healthy finger food for my toddler but they turned out to be really hard (even after soaking in milk for a minute or more they were still hard!). I don't think these are suitable for kids without molars to grind them down OR toddlers who are good at mashing things up with their gums. They are a size of about a small grape so perfect as a chocking hazard. So before buying the twelve pack try one from stores like whole foods.

review/text: Tried a box of these for my one-year-old.  Fun shape, and a good size for little hands.  However, they have a taste like puffed cardboard, and after the first few chomps my little guy is not too interested.  He'd rather eat something else.

review/text: I've traveled into NYC to the flower district, and shopped in Bonzai shops, and picked up pretty good Bonzai over the years.  NONE have compared to the quality and beauty of the bonzai from this source.<br /><br />The people I gave these to as gifts were blown away.<br /><br />Not only were they good strong specimens, they were beautifully shaped and pruned.  These are not just small cuttings stuck in the ground and allowed to grow until mature enough to ship.  They are crafted for beauty.<br /><br />Buy them here, and you will be truly pleased.

review/text: Not worth the money.<br /><br />The plant that I received is not even close to the pictures that are shown. There is no single trunk, it's just a bush.<br /><br />Bonsai's are supposed to look like trees but without a trunk there's not really anything I can do to remedy this... Rather disappointed, and I'm not sure if I can return it or not.<br /><br />What I have received makes me quite suspicious of the 5-star reviews that this product has also received.

review/text: I have received this Satsuki Azalea as a gift. The person who gave it to me was very excited ... until the box was opened.  Wat we have found in the box was just a small bush, not cut, not trained at all, nothing that was even close to the picture. And I do not mean flowers. Well, I thought that it was my job to train it, which I will do.  By no means however it was the intent of the gift giver.

review/summary: Beautiful Bonsai
review/text: I had seen a 750 year old Satsuki bonsai at a large bonsai shop that I visit once a year. (Several years ago). I fell madly in love with this bonsai, but could not afford the $1,000 plus price tag. I had been looking for this bonsai forever, craft fairs, bonsai shops, flower shops, you name it.  One day, I was just looking for different things, surfing through Amazon.com and there it was.  The bonsai that I waited for, longed for and wanted so badly!  The best thing is that I got it just before I went in for surgery.  I knew that it was waiting for me at home, to come home and take care of it so that it will flower for me, year after year.  In fact, it came with buds on it and flowered the day before I went into the hospital!  What a wonderful gift to give yourself!!!

review/text: I received this plant for Mother's Day from my daughter.  There were no flowers and looked nothing like the picture.  Like several other reviews, the plant was dead within the month, although I followed the instructions.  When watering the plant, because the DIRT was so hard, the water just ran right off, rather than soaking in.  Finally, I kept it sitting in a pan of water in addition to the regular watering.  Unfortunately, by then it was too late.  Instead of the package being addressed to me, it was addressed with my daughter's name and my address.  I do not recommend buying this plant.

It did end up arriving on Monday ( I was hoping for Friday).  When it did arrive as a gift to my Mother in law, the name on box was someone completely different with my mother in laws address. The gift note included was also from someone elses family.  Needless to say she was confused.  After sorting it out she said the product was cute had one little flower on it.  Very dissapointed in the shipping as it was labeled to be a gift for Mother's day.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012QJBKQ">Brussel's Bonsai - Azalea Bonsai</a>

review/text: This was a replacement that I bought for the one that my son gave me for Mother's Day.  That one came from [...]., and it was healthy, but I somehow managed to kill it.  In the meantime, I became very fond of the idea of having a bonsai plant, and I'm planning to buy a more expensive one later on, but for now, I love this one. Unless he notices, I'm not mentioning that it's a different Azalea.<br /><br />Obviously Azaleas are outdoor plants, but our winters can get cold, even down south, so I bought a grow-light from Amazon.com, and I'm going to try to get this Azalea through the winter indoors.  In the spring, I can set it out under the arbor in the backyard.<br /><br />It came well packaged, hardly any dirt or leaves had fallen into the box, and the soil was still damp.  I very gently freed it from the supporting cardboard by cutting the side out of the box.  Just a few minutes of snipping random yellow leaves (only half a dozen or so), and it looks happy underneath the grow-light.  I placed a pretty rock and a little mudman statue underneath the "tree". Wish me luck with this one!

review/text: I have loved shredded wheat since I was a kid - it's such a good crunchy backdrop for fresh summer berries or peaches, or bananas or dried fruit in the winter.  Yesterday I was at my local grocery looking for just plain shredded wheat - not a SINGLE box was not frosted with some kind of sugary coating.  It is no wonder there is an obesity epidemic in this country :-(  Decided I'd check online to see if I could obtain it that way as opposed to in the market - and was delighted to discover that Amazon not only carried it, but it's a Prime item!  I am widowed so 5 boxes will last me awhile, but especially in summer when wonderful fruit is in season, I will be having this for breakfast most days.  Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Very impressed with this fantastic deal!
review/text: I now have more vanilla beans than I know what to do with for the price I'd pay locally for maybe 4-6 of them. These are all very nice, though I'm not a super high-end gourmand so if you are you might have specific needs that I'm unaware of like only getting a specific variety or brand. For this price, though, I now have 112 long, lovely vanilla beans. It's nice that they are in 4 separate vacuum packs, though it would make a bit more sense to have them packed in 8 different packs because it's the rare consumer that needs so many beans at once. They keep nicely though if you wrap them in wax paper then put them in ziplock and keep them somewhere dry and dark like your pantry. They are so cheap that I don't feel bad about using a bunch of them for air fresheners, even. I put a couple in my white sugar and I've been enjoying vanilla sugar in all sorts of things. Anyway, if you're looking for a great deal on a ridiculous number of vanilla beans, don't be afraid you're getting something sub-par for this price because they're better than any I've bought in those little glass tubes.<br /><br />-Edit Dec 2010-<br />These are now double what I paid for them. They are still a good deal at that price, but not nearly the steal that they were at thirty bucks. I don't know if they fluctuate in price based on some sort of seasonal harvest or availability, but buyers should be aware that the price can go up or down dramatically.

review/text: Tis is a very delicate tea. The aroma  promises more than the flavor delivers, but it is still a good tea for rainy days. I can't taste too much of e coconut, but the smell is there. There are also strong notes of vanilla. I think I'll try blending this with something... Not sure what, though. Maybe a little orange or peach. I am also interested to try it iced, with a little sweetener.  All in all, a light, refreshing tea. I don't think I'll buy it again, but I will certainly drink the whole tin.<br /><br />Context:<br />I like light, floral teas and bright fruity ones. If it is a fruit tea for me it has to be totally fruit or a fruit tea with a light white or green base - nothing heavy. I love rose, jasmine and orchid teas. That being said, I reviewed thai coconut tea within the context of my likes and dislikes. I hope they help to target the review.
