review/summary: My Mistake for Not Reading Very Thoroughly!
review/text: Actually, I thought I was going to get a jar of EACH of the three mustards.  Oops!  Received package today, was confused when I opened it to find only one jar of mustard. Back to Amazon to look at product. Ahhh ... they show a shot of three mustards, but you only get one jar!! So, my fault for not reading thoroughly -- but Amazon should really REALLY have an individual shot of each jar, and ditch the pic that shows three mustards. It is misleading. This jar of mustard is a "stocking stuffer" gift for my sweetie -- he loves Irish whiskey and mustard, so this seems like a win-win situation! $7.00 for it but that's about what I'd pay in hoity-toity gourmet market in Manhattan anyway, so no big deal. It was carefully packaged and I figure boyfriend will be delighted with it.

review/summary: Best Mustards EVER!
review/text: I was first introduced to these mustards in Ireland.  They are amazing and I was happy to find them on Amazon.  My favorite of the three is the Irish Whiskey flavor.  The Guinness flavor is amazing as well.  A little pricey for the amount you get (7.2 oz) but they're so good it's worth the expense.  Highly recommended!!

review/summary: It'll Put Hair on Your Hot Dog!
review/text: I decided to go shamrocks-to-the-wall this St. Patrick's Day. Too many years, I've been left on the wrong side of the rainbow, stuck holding my Irish for a whole 'nother year. This year, I was determined to paint the town -- and myself, if need be, inside and out -- GREEN.<br /><br />St. Paddy's Day just isn't the same without a wee tipple or three of the old witches' brew. Sadly, I couldn't find real Irish whiskey available for sale on Amazon. So I did the next best thing and bought these fine Irish mustards, made with the very hair of the dog I was looking for.<br /><br />I'm Irish enough to know that fine whiskey from the old country should be messed with as little as possible. So when the condiments arrived, I filled a nice fresh highball glass with a few ice cubes, scooped in three fingers of wholegrain Irish whiskey mustard, and sipped it by a roaring fire.<br /><br />I can't say this product was quite as 'smooth' as the other Irish whiskeys I've had. The color was rich and dark, and I definitely detected a hint of the familiar smoky peat. But most of the other characteristics I was looking for seemed masked -- muted somehow by a very front-forward... how should I say it? "Mustardiness," I think would be the technical term.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't recommend sipping this neat. Sadly, this vintage is probably best mixed -- perhaps in a whiskey sour, or a mustard julep, or some sort of pretzel-flavored Irish coffee.

review/text: This stuff is fabulous.  I have a real chewer, and she knows how to break up the cookies almost immediately by throwing the Kong against the walls and into the air.  By spraying some paste on the inside walls of the Kong, she has to spend some extra time with it, keeping her busy longer!  They absolutely love this stuff - I can hide them anywhere and they know the minute they enter the room that they're around.  Wonderful product.

review/summary: Oh, the gas! The horrible, horrible gas...
review/text: Let's get one thing straight first: dogs love this stuff. I mean they REALLY LOVE IT. Not just my puppy, but every dog in my office - the second this stuff comes out, my desk is surrounded by noses that smelled it from across the office. And they want it so bad they'll watch wistfully as my puppy devours it, just a little bit, from his Kong. When he's done, they get in line to steal the Kong and the lucky one will spend several minutes working on it just in case there's any left.<br /><br />By the end of the afternoon, I am choking on the odor that rises at regular intervals from under my desk in nearly visible clouds of pure dog fart stench. By the time we get home, even the puppy will stop in his tracks every few minutes and startle at his own rear end, not entirely sure what's going on back there but knowing it's probably not good. By the end of the evening I am swearing to myself once again that tomorrow, no matter how desperate I am to occupy him and get some work done, I won't give this stuff to the puppy and turn him into a 6.5lb tactical nuke.<br /><br />I think today was the last time he'll be getting it, and the rest of the can is going in the trash. It's just not worth it!

However when it came, it was pepperoni flavor instead of fresh breath- the exact opposite!! :-O  However, the dogs still enjoyed it, although I won't order it online again since its a little bit cheaper at walmart- and I can be sure to get the right flavor!<br /><br />However, overall this Kong filler is awesome to keep our 2 large dogs entertained for a little while during the day- and they love it!

review/text: Although the product can be a bit pricey, it can be worth it.  I put a Kong liver snap treat (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DHNY6">KONG Stuff'N Snacks, Liver, 11-Ounce, Large</a>) in the Kong (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8">KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Large, Red</a>) first, then "anchor" it with the liver paste.  I stick the whole thing in the freezer for a few hours to a few weeks, until I want to give it to my dog.  Freezing makes it last 20-30 minutes instead of the 20-30 seconds it would take her to empty the Kong if it wasn't frozen.<br /><br />She is terrified of thunderstorms, and will keep us up with pacing, barking, howling and whining if not distracted.  This stuff will distract her from ANYTHING.  Then I can sleep...ZZZzzzzzzzz.........

Just buy a large peanut butter or cream cheese or throw left over chicken in the Kong and freeze it. Why pay this if you can get 20x the use out of a jar of peanut butter?

review/summary: Careful with this!
review/text: When I first discovered this product, and how my Toy Fox Terrier puppy reacted to it, I was thrilled.  It was so hard to get her to slow down and do some productive chewing while I was busy.  However, I did notice that her stool was often a bit loose after eating this "puppy goo".  I started stuffing her Kong with kibbles to make sure there was substance and not just the gooey stuff, in hopes that I wouldn't have to take it away from her totally.  It seemed to work for a little while, then suddenly, pools of stool again.  Even when I froze the stuff, it didn't help.  Only gave her one a week, didn't help.  It may be that toy breeds have a difficult time with it and heartier dogs will be fine.  But be cautious.<br /><br />One further note:  I've noticed that the textural contents of the cans vary.  Not sure how or why.  Be wary of expiration dates!

review/text: My dog takes supplements everyday and has for many years. Used to use peanut butter and have used all types. Never really liked doing that because of all the sugar in it. Have tried spreadable cheese too but it's too rich for her system. So saw this while ordering other Kong products and thought I'd give it a try. She's always a little combative but she takes them none the less using this stuff and it doesn't mess up her digestive system. Texture is a little runny even though I refrigerate it but still able to coat her pills well enough with it.

review/summary: Convenient Kong Stuffer but...
review/text: My dogs LOVE the taste of this PB Stuff 'N Paste and I like and appreciate the convenience of being able to add PB to their Kongs with no mess whatsoever. That being said, I went through an entire can of this stuff way too fast. The label says it's concentrated and to use it sparingly, so I did. The problem is, if you have large dogs like I have, you will probably go through a can of this in less than two weeks. It's too expensive for me so I'm back to using real PB in their Kongs.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: I have to say I am a fan of the Kong brand. So far, they're one of the few things I've bought for my Lab puppy that he hasn't managed to destroy. I use the paste inside his Kongs to keep him busy. Whenever he sees the can and start putting some out, the smell gets him all excited. I've tried peanut butter once but it made my pup super hyper (never doing that again). I find this a better alternative.

review/text: I haven't tried it, nor will I.  There are so many corn and soy byproducts in the ingredients list that it's an automatic no for me.  90% of the soy and corn crops are genetically modified (RoundUp Ready--gee they come with their very own pesticide grown in!) and unless it says organic or non-GMO, it's guaranteed to be GM.  I won't eat GM products, and I don't feed them to my livestock or my pets.

review/summary: Delightful little packs of olives!
review/text: First had these Oloves as the result of a United flight. They were in a snack pack given to me for being moved from an aisle in EconomyPlus to a middle in the back of the plane, but I'd just eaten lunch. So I took them home.<br /><br />They're delightful! I just ordered a 10-pack of the Lemony Lover. Good for a lunchbox, road trip, afternoon snack or anything you want a proteiny, low-fat, low-carb snack. And because they're dry-packed in the European style instead of standing in brine like olives at most U.S. grocery stores, you can eat them with your fingers.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed them.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the're awfully pricey at $1.59 per packet. Behind a sandwich, it's the most expensive thing in my lunchbag.

You can hand them out as treats using just one roll instead of three or four smaller rolls.<br /><br />The price was good compared to others advertised on Amazon.  I would make this purchase again.  Check on saving shipping by ordering more than one box at a time.  That makes it an even better bargain.

review/summary: Falcon Farms, Bold & Beautiful Bouquet
review/text: I ordered these flowers on the internet from the UK via Amazon in America and it couldn't have been simpler, they were ordered in a few clicks, and on there way.<br /><br /> I had never ordered flowers like this before or from Amazon but they are a company I trust implicity. The Bouquet arrived exactly at its destination when I was told it would, and was apparently beautifully and impecibly packaged with a lovely message card, also inside were all the care instruction for the flowers and flower food etc. My friend has told me "You could not have walked and picked these flowers from a field any fresher" that they are an enormous arrangement with so many flowers and colours it was hard for her to describe, and best of all is they are sented, and very beautifully sented. My friends were just so overwhelmed by the package and are frightened I've spent to much, I've told her to look on line because I am so thrilled with the service. And certainly my friends in the States are going to be using this service and Falcon Farms for sending flowers to there loved ones now.<br />To get this kind of Bouquet delivered here within the UK would have cost about � 80(at the very least) and I kid not. I'm just jelous now that I can't experience the Falcon Farms flowers over here!!!!<br /><br />Thank you for letting me send a token of love this way, and making it a pleasure, I would definitely use this service again.

review/summary: Nice but Ordinary
review/text: A gift basket should be a fun indulgence; something one usually would not purchase for oneself but would be happy to receive or give to another.  This basket might fill the bill for one whose tastes run towards the familiar and comforting rather than the exotic or gourmet and who doesn't object to artificial ingredients. This is the kind of basket one might give a boss, a client, or someone who might be appreciated but is not a close friend.<br /><br />The product selection is not likely to offend an omnivore, is ordinary enough to not send any unintended messages, and is nicely packaged.  Of course, Amazon Prime sweetens the deal with the added convenience of free 2 day or $3.99 next day shipping. It is truly a nearly effortless last minute gift.  It gets 3 stars because the product selection is just a bit too ordinary for my tastes and the quality of the items is not on a par with the price (no real gourmet items). For a description of what was in my basket, read on.  As you'll see, the products are mainly from the USA.  I was suprised there was only one product from Europe and nothing at all from Spain or Italy.<br /><br />Basket Contents<br /><br />1 3.5 oz. box of Water Wheel Fine Wafer Crackers (Tuscan).

review/summary: ... a little light on actual food
review/text: I was overall disappointed with this basket.  While the salami and cheese spread were good, much of the rest of the basket seemed to be fillers.  The box of chocolates actually contained wrapped candy (a mallo cup, a peanut butter cup and some of what was once called penny candy).  There were crackers and pretzels (a small bag contained two hard pretzels).  I realize with a purchase like this you are really paying a premium for the packaging and delivery but I thought this one was a little light on actual food.

review/summary: Diverse and tasty treats; well-organized, it's a thoughtful and attractive gift.
review/text: As I said in a recent review for the larger Celebrate with a Crowd offering from ig4U, you start with a deep and attractive basket, then fill it (above a buffer) with a variety of tasty and unusual treats ranging from hard pretzels, to delicate truffles, imported sandwich cookies, unusual grain mustard, and number of other welcome surprises, and you have this well-stocked gift basket.  "Celebrate with a Friends" is a good size for a small(ish) family or modest group of friends.<br /><br />The contents are attractively arranged, in many cases they've got their own printed boxes as a presentation/organizational layer with the original wrapping underneath (which is to say that you may open a box that indicates pretzels to find a bag of pretzels within).  The basket is no Longaberger, but the one I received was of a relatively high quality construction level and was genuinely handsome.  The whole package is wrapped in plastic and then a rich brown ribbon with a card -- all in all you're left with a gift that is likely to give the impression that you spent more than you may have.<br /><br />I was pleased with the basket, delighted to discover some new treats with which I was previously unfamiliar, and in general found myself very happy with what I received.  It's worth noting that some of the exceptionally poor reviews below are entirely accurate and not at odds with my own experience -- indeed, even the harshest echo my own feelings about the product as it was represented in prototype in late October.  Without speaking for the company, my understanding is that many of us received prototype packages that saw the aforementioned original packaging represented by things like empty individual serving cereal boxes wrapped in inkjet printer paper.  The end result was, as one reviewer put it, sort of creepy.  The company replaced these prototypes with their final version, and I have gone from seeing this as a 1-star product worth (as others have) warning prospective buyers away, to feeling like they really represent a fine value.  I would have no problem whatsoever buying one of these as a gift for a group of friends.  So my review is based on the 'final' version of the product as it was received in late Nov/early Dec 2011, and not upon the late Oct prototype received.  I only make this distinction for the sake of browsers being able to consider the totality of the currently available reviews, putting the product change timeline into perspective.

review/text: Our 3 dogs love Dingo bones.  But these peanut butter flavor bones are an obsession of our smallest rat terrier.  He's only 5 pounds, so bones tend to last several sittings for him.  Give him one of these and he's occupied for as long as it takes to finish.  He'll still play with other bones, but he loses his mind when he sees me go for this bag.  I just wish they were priced as well as the other Dingo products and less difficult to find.

I think that's pretty disgusting since this is a product that's intended for consumption by your pet.  Also, there were portions of the red "meat" that looked like it had been chewed on and the white bone portion was stained red all over.  Basically it looked as if a dog had chewed on it for a little and then repackaged up and sold on Amazon.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Too big for my dog
review/text: I have a labrador retriever. He weighs 82 lbs. He loved the bone, but I made the mistake and allowed him to eat the bone in one sitting. It was too much of a shock to his digestive system.  The next morning he developed diarrhea. I' m not sure if the bone is the reason the diarrhea lasted so long, but to be causious I will not buy the bones again.  To be fare about the product, I bought three of the bones and the last one was the one associated with my dog's problem, but of course that last bone is the only one he eat in one sitting.  I believe the product would be best for larger dog's than mine, or for smaller dog if the owner regulator the amount of the bone that is eaten at each sitting .

review/text: This  crust taste so much better than the usual store bought graham cracker type. Not so sweet with a real nutty taste.  It really adds to your filling rather than just laying there. It does crumble a bit but baking before you fill it does help.<br />will purchase again.

review/summary: My Yorkie loves this.
review/text: My dog really loves the Stella and Chewy's freeze dried dog food. She ate her previous food a little at a time, all day long. I can give her a patty and it is gone in a matter of minutes, sometimes seconds.  Before I was worried she wasn't eating enough and now I am much more relieved knowing she is getting plenty to eat each day.

review/summary: Costly hypoallergenic diet
review/text: This food contains all of the good stuff and none of the fillers.  Because of the limited ingredients it is one of the few foods I can feed my dog, who is allergic to many common dog food ingredients.  Unfortunately due to the cost, I only use this food on a supplemental basis.  This bag would last for about 2 days for a dog weighing 20-25 pounds.  For that reason, I only feed this food a couple of times a week on a supplemental basis.  Even the larger packages are cost prohibitive.  On a side note, I've found the frozen raw diets are generally cheaper than freeze dried, so I'm hoping to source the frozen varieties locally.

review/summary: This is for small dogs only
review/text: So, if you look really closely at the picture of the product, it does say small dogs under the name.  However, it doesn't specify that in the amazon description, which I think is lame.  Suffice to say, these little 3 or so inch diameter patties will not function as anything but the world's most expensive bag of dog treats for my 100 lb. dog.  Had purchased these hoping for lightweight, packable dog food for backpacking that could be rehydrated, but this won't do it. The product itself seems fine if you've got a small dog; it is the lack of proper description that leads to my mediocre review.

review/text: I am a gadget-holic.  I just had to have this one.  I had 12 potatoes to peel so was excited to be able to do them in "8 seconds" each, as the commercial states.  They do fail to mention that you have to boil the potatoes first.  The gloves are huge - I normally buy a large in dishwashing gloves.  The fingers are so long that they were flopping around and the gloves are so big and cumbersome that it took me about 2 minutes each to get the first 2 done..  After that, I threw this useless "gadget" in the sink and got out a knife.  The instructions say to just rinse them off and let dry - yeah, good luck with that.

One problem is that they don't do well in humidity, turning into a solid mass.<br /><br />That fact will make it hard to buy a six-pack from here. Unless you live in Arizona or in a permanently climate-controlled house, you do not want to keep this product too long on the shelf. If it cakes, we have found that you can open the bottom of the container, place the product in a blender and make it usable.

review/text: This is my favorite cereal.  It's quick and easy to make (just put in pan or pop it in the microwave).  For a single serving just half the recipe on the box.  Also, if you put it in the microwave make sure you put it in there on about 30% power.  Otherwise you will have it all over your microwave.  It's great tasting, healthy, and keeps me full for a longer time than other cereals.  It's part of a heart-healthy diet, I got my dad eating it after his heart attack and he loves it.  If you are from Canada, it tastes just like Red River.  But if you are in the states, you don't have to pay all the shipping charges for this (like you do Red River).  It tastes great with a little brown sugar or agave and milk.

review/text: At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair. By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isn't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.<br /><br />I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  "real"beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and bribing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.<br /><br />Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

review/text: These seeds turn puffy and expand when they soak in water. Then, they can be added to drinks for texture. They have a very slight licorice flavor. The notable experience using these seeds is that they add texture to drinks. Some traditional Indian drinks use them. I have, however, used them in cold teas, juices, and other mixtures. It is said that they can cool the core temperature of the body. I have not experienced this.

review/text: Generally I hate sugarless gum because they always leave that terrible "sugary" aftertaste in your mouth but I buy them because I want to preserve my teeth and save calories at the same time. So I tried Orbit's Mint Mojito and wow I love this gum.  The taste is very clean, with a great lime/minty flavor without any aftertaste. The irony is that I was told by the manufacturer that they have discontinued this particular flavor making it very difficult to find in my neighborhood supermarket. Thank God for Amazon! I plan to buy again soon while supplies last.

Immediately I enrolled in the "subscribe and delivery" program which offers the product at a lower price and delivers on a regular basis. Wow. I love the french vanilla and the caramel flavors.  They come in 750 ml. PLASTIC bottles and I get the three packs.  My coffee is my daily reward and now I'm all set.  The best thing is that the sugar free syrups are perfect and are guilt free!

review/text: Hey, every culture has their ideal preference in cocoa. Look at the humble Nestle Milo or even Ovaltine---every nation has variations. Made in Singapore or anywhere in Asia is sweeter than their Latino counterpart. Mexicans or Colombians like that strong cocoa taste.<br /><br />Ive also tried Neuhaus, Chirardelli and other store brands, but I prefer Bellagio because there's no need to mix in milk for that smooth Belgian taste.<br /><br />Belgium or European chocolates are different from America's Hersheys brand. Their chocolate mix is not overpowering.<br /><br />Bellagio Chocolate Truffle reminds me of Starbuck's Signature chocolate drink with less calories (thhe company phased out this brand because of high caloric content -- 700 calories for the venti)<br /><br />So if you're on the go or a busy mom like me, Bellagio choco is the best comfort drink this cold season.

It is also my mother's favorite and she is very direct with her hints that it's time for me to send her some when her stock gets low.<br /><br />I read a review that someone thought the Bellagio brand had a chemical taste.  The reviewer might have been referring to other flavors.  There is a different taste that seems perhaps spicey, but not chemical.  I also like the fact that it contains non-dairy creamer because I do not drink milk.

review/text: I use hot chocolate packets to stir into my coffee.  I normally use Land O'Lakes hot chocolate, but I've had trouble getting some of my favorite flavors, so I wanted to try something new.  I ordered the Bellagio Chocolate Truffle flavor, and I suppose that it gets the job done.  But to make my coffee taste chocolatey enough, I've been having to mix in the Bellagio cocoa with a K-cup hot chocolate.  The flavor's a little flat, and the texture is pretty watery when compared to Land O'Lakes or even regular Swiss Miss.  I don't hate it, but there are better options out there, so I won't be ordering it again.
