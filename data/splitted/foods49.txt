review/summary: Believe the reviews - Way too salty
review/text: This beef jerky is extremely salty. I tried the wood smoked flavor, and I figured people were just being a bit picky. However, it really is overpowering and although it has a decent smoky flavor the salt is just way too much. The container says 570mg sodium or 24% of daily value for one serving. I would recommend trying a different product.

review/text: The Smokehouse Jerky is some of the best out there, a perfect quick snack. It has s great smoke flavor and texture. I even started a subscription to get it once a month....save 15% by doing it.<br />The only con would be a little on the salty side. If you like jerky you can't go wrong with this.

review/text: There are literally hundreds of jerky type products out there.  This is simply my favorite.  Real strips of beef, not ground up hamberger, that tastes like meat instead of preservatives without teriyaki or any other flavoring or sauce.  Good price, good product and great taste.  You'll be happy with this one.  When I'm looking for a non sugary snack, I reach for this first.

These sticks are cut thin making them tender and easy to chew, but they're just way too salty and definitely not worth $20

review/summary: Way Too Salty
review/text: I read the reviews and thought, I like salt. I thought the saltiness was on the exterior of the jerky.  There is very little salt taste on the outside of the jerky but the saltiness comes out with every chew. The strips are about the size of a chopstick or a very thin pencil. 12 ounces for $20+ is way too expensive.  There is very little beef flavor but too be fair it is probably covered up by the salt.  These taste very similar to the chopped and formed cheap jerky at the convenience mart that you swear you will never buy again but much more salty. The amount of salt made my tongue numb, if you want good jerky keep looking. (Jack Link's Smokehouse Beef jerky strips, wood smoked 30-count jar)

review/text: I like almost everything about this jerky, the toughness and chewiness. But it is just too salty. If you nibble it, you may enjoy it but that is not how i eat. Also, it is not good for my health to eat something this salty. I have run into too many of salty beef jerky patches recently. This review is for the wood smoked, but if other flavors contains the same amount of salt per serving, they will be just as salty. Why everything is either too fatty, sweet or salty??? Are they trying to get us addicted?

Also, being a jerky eater for 40+ years, I eat it because i like the toughness and chewiness of jerk. But the tube I got was nearly un-chewable. I have bit into some hard jerky in my time, but jeez louise, these were literally like chewing leather, many of the strips would not yield to my super powered bite.

review/text: I don't eat beef jerky, and I wanted to buy some for a Christmas gift.  I read all of the reviews at Amazon.com and decided that Jack Links would be the best purchase.  It came nicely packaged, but there is liquid in the packaging - a lot of it.  If you turn the packaging upside down, the movement of the liquid is obvious.  So now I have to pay to return soupy beef jerky and buy a different type.<br /><br />Three days since my original review.  Amazon cannot accept returns of food items, so it kindly replaced the beef jerky.  The replacement also has liquid in it.  It's not fat, but a liquid as described above.  This time, I'm asking for a refund.

review/text: This flavor of Fancy Feast is decidedly the favorite of our waif of a cat.  She is usually a very picky eater, but this trout flavor really gets her excited.<br /><br />The local store ran out of this flavor and may not restock it, so I ordered online.  We got a good price and the case of food arrived in good condition.<br /><br />I was a little confused by the old label image that was on the web site that is just different enough from the new label that I had to double check that I was getting the item that I was expecting.<br /><br />It turned out to be the correct item, so all was well.

review/text: I honestly cannot say that I saw any difference whatsoever in this variety compared to Friskies regular sliced beef version.  Actually, my cat preferred the regular Friskies over this one.  He's not really all that jazzed over these Fancy Feast varieties anyway, so if you're going to buy this one or the chicken, save your money and buy the regular Friskies versions.  They seem to taste better to the cat and it saves you money.  I've never had a cat that ever got too thrilled over this variety over the years so I guess I'll get the special ones instead.

review/text: Once or twice a year for a little variety and that's about enough for my cat of this particular variety.  He likes it for a change from his chicken, turkey and beef, but not very often.  He will eat about 3/4 of the can and then he's had enough. He's not a huge fish fan anyway, but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties.  The chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does, it will be easier to chew.  Don't know why my cat doesn't like this type of fish, but he really could care less about it.

review/summary: Four cats love it.
review/text: At 60 years old I have had the care of cats my entire life.  Presently have four cats, three of which were "barn cats" and one came out of the woods and adopted us.  These cats love and gobble up Friskies Pate varieties "Mariner's Catch", "Sea Captain's Choice" and "Ocean Whitefish with Tuna".  I also serve as a "foster parent" for the local pet shelter and find that these 3 varieties of food are the best tolerated and completely consumed of all varieties.  The "Salmon" pate is very rich and I use it only as a special treat.  Incidentally, my cats always reach great age on Friskies.  Our cat "Kitten" died at 23 years old. She jumped off of a high bed and severely injured her spine and at the time it happened the Vet asked what food we used all of those years.  It has always been Friskies...dry and wet pet foods.  I find it is the best value and maintains our pet's good health right to the end.  The youngest cat that has died in our care was 18 years old and I have have had 28 cats as permanent pets, and countless foster pets over the years.

review/summary: Our cats love this food
review/text: Of course, nobody can ever figure out what cats will like, but our experience is the opposite of the one-star review.<br /><br />Our two Bengal cats ate kibble for years, but after some serious teeth problems, they had to switch to canned food. We tried a few different brands and flavors. They'd eat it for a few days, then turn up their noses. Even expensive food from the vet's did not please them.<br /><br />So, we tried the Friskies Sea Captains Choice flavor, and they went nuts, gobbling it down like candy. We only bought a few cans at a time, figuring they would tire of it, but no, they have been eating it with gusto for a coupe of months now, so we buy it by the case.<br /><br />I don't understand about it not smelling good; perhaps they got a bad batch, but it smells like other cat foods to us, and the pate is easy to dish out. As long as the cats love it, who are we to complain?

I don't see why more companies don't forgo the maltitol and just use other sweetners that have less of an impact on digestion.

They love it and make sure they lick their Kong's clean without getting bored with it. Overall a great snack!

review/text: This food variety is ground, thus my cat doesn't care that much for this variety. But, he liked the taste of it a lot so I have been buying it off and on throughout the years.  My previous cat really liked it so I've purchased quite a few of these.  It's got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares? If your cat likes ground, give this one a try for sure.

review/text: This is another favorite in our house.  My cat doesn't want it more than 4 times a month or so, but he still wants it and licks the bowl clean.  It is fish, not his favorite, but he really likes his salmon and this one is outstanding.  It's ground (why don't they make a sliced or bits version?), not his favorite either, but he does get it down pretty quickly.  Try this one - it's a definite winner.

review/text: This one is a great basic food. Whatever is in it, cats really go for and mine is no exception.  My current cat really doesn't like the ground variety which is what this is.  He will eat it occasionally, so I only buy it about twice a year.  My previous cat had to have it more often and really enjoyed it.  It's hard to judge what a cat will eat so if your cat likes ground, give this one a go because it really seems to be a big favorite.

review/summary: High Quality Jerky.
review/text: Taste: Amazing. The honey flavor goes well with the smoked barbeque taste. It's soft, but not too soft. It also has a nice tang and spice to it, but nothing too extreme.<br />Smell: As soon as I opened it, everyone in my section ran up to see what the smell was. I'd describe it as alluring and inviting. Not overpowering or off-putting.<br />Price: For a pound of this quality of jerky, I'd expect it would cost more. Needless to say, you get more bang for your buck.<br /><br />In short, if you want a good jerky to snack on, you can't go wrong with this selection. Do your tastebuds a favor and get this jerky.

review/summary: ZiwiPeak is made in the US, consistency problems
review/text: Many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in New Zealand. It is now made in the US by Performance Pet Products. I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy.

review/summary: Neither cat will touch it :( But dogs go wild...5 Star for Dog Food Treat
review/text: We all know how picky cats can be.  It may be grain free, but food still smells, looks like, and fine details in label indicate "highly processed" with all the extra vitamins & minerals, which I think is the "turnoff" for the kitties. Doesn't say up front, but also contains New Zealand Green Mussell, which I am not sure how that ingredient fits in as I am not from New Zealand, but suspect locals rely on that for nutrients as we do mussells in this country.  They are spoiled on the real thing - minimally processed or raw rabbit, chicken, bird, wild caught salmon.  They will eat canned only if minimally processed.  Another cat food bites the dust but gives the dogs another treat! 1 STAR for not knowing about the New Zealand Mussell & for still being highly processed & therefore unpalatable as food for cats that love rabbit. 5 Star for a dog treat without the added hormones, grains, etc.

review/summary: What happened to Claxton Farms Quality???
review/text: I've eaten Claxton Farms fruit cakes for over 40 years and love them.  I thought I'd be smart and order 5 one pound cakes at once as I know I'd use them.  This time the quality control went out of town.  Lousy.  Absolutely disappointing.  Of the 5 loaves, one was good,  Two were so dry they crumbled rather than be cut and I ended up adding them to cake batter in cupcakes or put on ice cream as topping,  totally unable to slice.<br /><br />the last two loaves just the opposite, they were runny.  When taken out of the wrapper they just flopped over, again, had to use as ice cream topping or put into cake batter for cupcakes.<br /><br />Claxton Farm might have sold out or fired the Quality Controller.  Awful quality after all these years.  Do NOT order from Claxton as you don't know what you'll get.  They lost a long time customer with me.

These were overloaded with the good stuff that makes a Fruit cake really great. So I re-ordered in Christmas of 2011. What a disappointment! I ordered 5 one pound cakes. When my order arrived, I was so excited. Yes I like fruit cake. Only too be very disappointed. Not only where the cakes void of very much fruit, unless you want too count the raisons as fruit. I will not be ordering Clayton Fruit Cakes next year. I can get the same results from a Hostess Fruit cake, and only spend $3.50, instead of close to 30 dollars for the Clayton cakes.

review/summary: Very Disappointed
review/text: Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored "cake".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.<br /><br />I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash.

review/summary: Innocence lost
review/text: So, I moved from Europe to the US, I settled in my apartment etc, and after a week or so I decided that I wanted some candy. I went to the supermarket and started looking for some M&M's. Then this weird *red* bag caught my eye and I thought, hah!, this country is funny, they put an 's' instead of an 'm' on their M&M's here, and the bag is all different too.<br /><br />So I took one bag home to try it. I grabbed a handful of the presumed M&M's and ... what a surprise. This was obviously not what I had bargained for, and I considered ditching this wrong purchase, but instead I figured I'd give this weird stuff another chance at some other time.<br /><br />Do you realize that my mortal soul could _still_ have been saved, at that point ??<br /><br />It was only in the next few days that the addiction set in. I found myself longing for more of that flavor when the bag was through; I wouldn't have reckoned at first, that I would actually buy many more of these bags on purpose.<br /><br />Now my willpower has been eternally challenged. My stomach will never be like before. My jaw is numb from the endless compulsive chewing. And I can just feel my teeth desintegrating right when I take another dose. Why do I forever ache for that soothing acidic taste ? They're so delicious they ought to be outlawed !

I do find myself reaching in and getting handfuls at times but I try not to go overboard.  If you love Skittles than this bag will probably be good for you but if you are just a casual candy eater than maybe not.

review/summary: skittles are tasty!
review/text: I have an interesting relationship with Skittles.  When I was about 10 years old, I absolutely thought they were average at best and couldn't understand what everyone loved so much about them.  "Too sour, not tasty enough" was my impression.  Later however, I entered my teenage years and it actually took until I nearly graduated from high school that the taste caught on with my tastebuds and became super delicious to me.  What also got me hooked is this kid I remember from 10th grade science class who would ALWAYS bring in a bag of Skittles *every single day* and chew on them, and all the girls liked him because of his good looks and smooth personality, so Skittles sort of gave me the impression that COOL kids eat Skittles.  However, please buy bags of Skittles from your local grocery store- it's not worth it here on amazon with the high dollar price.  You can find plenty of places in your area selling them for cheaper prices.  My only complaint with Skittles is that, despite the color, they *all* taste exactly the same to me!  Purple, green, red, orange, yellow... I really can't taste a difference between these supposed "different flavors".  Then again, I don't have a favorite color in a rainbow so maybe this makes perfect sense!

review/text: Skittles are a great candy but for this product i would say do not buy it here, I have seen this same bag for $5.89 on sale and not on sale for $7.99 at some big chain stores. the candies themselves are fine and if you are thinking of getting a big bag you know what they taste like just don't overspend to get a big bag (price wise might be cheaper to buy a bunch of little bags)

review/summary: Much better deal nowadays!
review/text: The add on program makes this a great deal for a natural, very tasty sugar.<br /><br />You can add to any order over $25 or buy 8 (like I did) and have all 16# delivered free. Either way an outstanding value!<br /><br />There are lots of good reasons to eat natural sugar. I use in my coffee and making bread. Use 1 to 1 instead of "white" sugar for your needs. You may find that yeasts will proof faster and more bubbly with this type of organic sugar.<br /><br />The zip-loc bag does not seal all that well. So I store in a quart mason jar in the dark cupboard. Each bag is sightly more than one quart. The balance is added to the sugar bowl.<br /><br />Give this sugar a try. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

review/summary: Absolutely Scrumptious
review/text: I buy syrups to make soda with plain seltzer water, and this one is by far the absolute most delicious one I have found. This particular flavor is incredibly true to a real red grapefruit flavor, yet sweet and powerful. What's great is that the flavor works whether I want just a little or a lot, depending on how sweet I want my soda to be on any given day. It's comparable to Squirt / Fresca, but honestly I think the actual flavor is much richer and more satisfying. If you like the taste of grapefruit even a little bit, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: A vey good sampling of goat cheeses, but not Great
review/text: I love goat cheeses and buy them on a regular basis.  A lot of people seem unaware that there are many other types of goat cheese on the market other than the ultra fresh Chevre.  I have purchased this selection by iGourmet for both myself and for others as gifts.  The reactions from my friends have been mixed.  They all enjoy the harder chesses, such as the Goat Cheddar and the Ibores.  However, some people don't like fresh, soft goat chesses and one of the reasons that I send them this selection is so that they can try a variety of different chesses.  However, in the selection that I was sent it contained two versions of Chevre-type cheeses including the delicious Buche de Chevre.  Still, I wished they had more of the harder to find goat milk versions of cheeses traditionally made from cow's milk such as the goat's milk Cheddar and Gouda.<br /><br />As for as price goes, this is a surprisingly good value.  You are getting two pounds of very expensive chesses for a little more than I have paid for one pound of some of the varieties here.  One of my friends did receive a substitution for one of the chesses.  Instead of the cheddar they received the Cypress Grove's Midnight Moon.  I can certainly understand why substitutions would be necessary and I felt that they replaced the listed cheese with an even better variety.  Overall I am very pleased with both the price and the quality of the cheeses, I just wish that they had less fresh and more unique forms of this wonderful type of chesse.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1423603680">Goat Cheese</a>

review/summary: Not real veggies, but a really good 'better' than chips snack
review/text: It wouldn't be very smart to replace real veggies with these veggies straws but if you want a healthier salty snack I personally can't think of a better one on the market.  The portion size for 130 calories is absolutely gluttonous.  One portion is equal to 38 straws.  That is quite a bit of snacking for 130 calories.  These are crispy and taste great.  There is no trans fat, no preservatives, and kosher certified.  The single serving does have 7 grams of total fat and 11 carbs.  Eating these all the time might not be great for your diet but when you want something this is fantastic option.  I have lost 92lbs in the last year and half by following a sensible diet and I am happy to say this brand of Veggie Straws has helped me along the way.

review/summary: Good flavor, a little misleading
review/text: Someone grabbing a bag of Veggie Straws may mistakenly believe Veggie Straws are made primarily of vegetables other than potatoes.  In fact, a quick read of the back of the bag reveals they are made primarily of potatoes and flavored with tomato and spinach.  This explains why they taste so much like potato chips.  The texture is light and crisp, and while it's been many years since I've had pork rinds, that's what I think of when I bite into these straws.<br /><br />Sensible Portions is the name of the company.  A 20 ounce bag contains 20 servings, which is about 38 straws.  Each serving has 7 grams of fat.  Compare that to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0071BYOK8">Frito Lay Baked! Ruffles Original Potato Crisps</a>, which contains only 3 grams of fat per 1 ounce serving.<br /><br />If you can overlook the fat content, Veggie Straws are actually quite tasty, and they do have that psychological edge with that name.  I feel like I'm eating healthier, even when I'm not.

review/summary: A Big Ripoff!
review/text: I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!

review/summary: Great food for senior dogs
review/text: My dog is 12 years old, and his breed (powderpuff chinese crested) is very subject to gum disease and tooth loss. After the last visit to the vet, with surgery that cost 13 of his teeth, I have struggled to find him a food that he could eat, that he liked, and would maintain his weight, his energy level (very playful pooch!), AND be good for him. He doesn't like soft food, so it's been a real task.<br /><br />This food does it. It's not brittle or "dusty". It is shaped like pellets (almost like rabbit food) and breaks really easy. It's tasty, cause he scarfs it right up, and he also has managed to get some weight on him. He looks better than ever before. I can at last rest easy knowing he is getting a decent nutritious food.

review/summary: Works well with my old snaggle-toothed dog
review/text: I have a fourteen-year-old chihuahua who is missing half his teeth. He has always been a dry dog food grazer who enjoyed picking out a piece or two of kibble and taking his time playing with it a while before he ate it. But he got where he couldn't chew the dry kibble, and for many reasons the canned wet dog food was not working out. This Bil-Jac Senior proved to be the answer. He is able to have the comfort of food in his bowl all day like he's used to, and he can actually eat it when he's hungry. I am grateful for this product because we are both old dogs who are pretty set in our ways.

review/text: I agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote in their review.  I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick.  This is because I have severe allergies to wheat and soy.  Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants.  So when I found Nana's cookies I was as happy as can be.  Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it's better than going without cookies.  It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious.  If you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are  a very welcome addition to that diet.

review/summary: Not a Gluten Free Product
review/text: I am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten-free diet for over six years, and was excited to learn about this product.  After eating it, [the taste and texture was not bad] I became sick in the way that I always do when ingesting gluten. Nana's also makes non-gluten products, and clearly are not careful about cross-contamination.  If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.  I also think that the company should not deceive their customers, many who suffer from celiac disease, and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product.

One of the better gluten free/casien free/egg free cookies I've eaten.

review/summary: Makes a nice gluten-free strawberry shortcake.
review/text: Nana's cookies are good eaten plain.  They are a bit crumbly compared to cookies made with wheat flour.<br /><br />The cookies are individually packaged.  I find it better to cut the plastic open with scissors to avoid breaking the cookies.<br /><br />If you want the cookies crumbled, just break them up in the packaging and then cut open with scissors to dispense neatly.<br /><br />I like to cut up strawberries and crumble a Nana's cookie over them.  With a little whipped cream, it's just like a good strawberry shortcake.  They are great crumbled over bananas, too.<br /><br />Despite being somewhat fragile.  Nana's cookies from Amazon usually arrive intact.

review/summary: Nana Banana - a delicious gluten-free treat for kids or adults!
review/text: Let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten-free world, baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the "glue" (gluten) that holds them together.  Taking this into consideration, Nana's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar.<br /><br />At only 130 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, and 7 grams of sugar (natural fruit sugar), the Nana Banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults.  The amount of banana is just right, and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside.<br /><br />Each cookie measures approximately 3.5 inches long by 1.5 inches wide...perfect for a light snack or dessert, especially for kids.  Amazon has the best price around on Nana's Cookie Bars, so rest assured that you are getting a good deal, even though they are pricier than "regular" cookies made with corn syrup and sugar.<br /><br />Good cookies aren't cheap, and cheap cookies aren't good!  Give Nana's banana cookies a try.  (No, I don't work for Nana's but am a happy, loyal customer!)

review/summary: a Chocolate treat
review/text: My 2 year old eats the Chocolate Munch Cookie and LOVES them. I bought them not because they were gluten free, but because they are sweetener free. He calls them "chocolate treat," if that gives you any indication of how good he thinks they are. I would definitely recommend this flavor to everyone. I have found that with the subscribe and save discount I can get the boxes cheaper on Amazon than in stores like Sunflower, Sprouts and Whole Foods.

review/summary: Disappointed in texture
review/text: It is close to impossible to find a cookie that is both soy free, wheat free, and the only sugar that is used is from natural juices: apple, etc. That is the only reason I gave the cookie such a high ranking...<br />As for taste, the chocolate flavor is pronounced, I enjoy the "crunch", however, the texture of the cookie has a lot to be desired. The cookie needs to either be crunchier or more moist. As is it wants to stick to the roof of your mouth, and is just odd. Making it unappealing. If I had tasted the item prior to ordering, I wouldn't have bought a whole box full.

review/summary: price keeps increasing. . .
review/text: i have enjoyed this product for quite some time.  however, i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing!  at $35 per case, customers are paying more than $4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous!  i will find a healthier, more reasonably priced snack to munch on. shame on nana and amazon. . .
