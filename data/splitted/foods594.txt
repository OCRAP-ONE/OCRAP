review/summary: If you got Ginger Beer, consider yourself lucky
review/text: I've been making all kinds of soda for the last 5 years from various concentrates, with a home-made carbonation kit that consists of little more than a tank of CO2, some hoses, a filter and regulator.  I regularly get the Homebrew Root Beer and Homebrew Cola and have tried every other flavor they sell.  For starters, the Ginger Ale (and several others) keeps the essential oils in an alcohol suspension, yet is sold in a plastic bottle.  It doesn't take a chemist to figure out just how stupid that is.  Every bottle I've received has been partially collapsed, bubbled/sticky on the outside and has 'particulate matter' on the inside, due to the volume of alcohol migrating through the plastic.  Same with the Lemon flavor as well - it's been totally revolting.<br /><br />Avoid this - get the Ginger Beer instead of the Ginger Ale, use Koolaid unsweetened mixes for the fruit flavors, and really just use the Homebrew label for the Cola and RootBeer products.  Get any soda concentrate with essential oils in suspension (read: most) from a distributor that uses glass bottles.<br /><br />My Soda Rig:<br />*The Carbonator - fits to 20ounce and 2liter bottles: [....]<br />*Ball Lock Disconnect - connects the Carbonator to the CO2 tank: [....]<br />*5lb or 20lb CO2 tank (get the 20 if you don't need your rig portable) - local beer homebrew or welding store.  Make sure it's food grade.<br />*Dual Gauge CO2 Regulator: [....]<br />*3-6 feet clear tubing with 1/4inch interior diameter.  It only needs to handle 50-60 psi, so it doesn't need to be reinforced.<br /><br />Most of this stuff can be gotten cheap from various local sources or somewhere here on Amazon ([....]).  Once you put it together, you can start carbonating just about anything.

review/summary: Root Beer
review/text: I bought this hoping to make a Root Ber my grandkids would enjoy helping make and drink. We followed the included directions carefully. The resultant root beer was drinkable, but tasted like wintergreen, very strongly. I thought it was OK, but the grandkids wouldn't touch it after one taste. Decent wintergreen soda, but not muck like root beer, although the stuff smells great.

review/text: This concentrated Egg Nog Extract is difficult to find, but well worth the effort.  I have been drinking the "Home Mix Gourmet Egg Nog" by Rainbow Flavors since the late 1990's.

review/summary: Buyer beware
review/text: I ordered this item, and was instead shipped a different item (ginger beer).  There is a difference, and the company that makes this makes both.  However, Amazon's warehouses are too stupid to recognize the difference.  When I politely pointed out to them that they had shipped me the wrong item, they very politely apologized, and promised to send me the right item...whereupon they sent me exactly the same wrong item again.  When I complained again, and asked them to either find the right item, or refund my money, they ignored me.  If you really want ginger ale, you can buy this mix on the Internet from other suppliers.  Don't say I didn't warn you.

review/summary: SIMPLY GREAT
review/text: THESE BEANS ARE SIMPLY GREAT.  YOU CAN UTILIZE THEM IN MANY WAYS.<br />While dry beans are general soaked for two to four hours prior to cooking, Anasazi beans yield better results when soaked overnight or for at least eight hours. Known to cook much faster than ordinary pinto beans, Anasazi beans are often used to replace pinto beans in a variety of dishes including chili, soup and popular Latin dishes such as chalupas and nachos, or add mopre water and have bean soup.  My favorite is to cook them with a package of Liption Beef Onion Soup.  Wash them through three washings of water, then cover with two or three inches of water and let them soak overnight.  Drain, cover with water, add seasonings of choice, bring them to a boil, reduce the heat and let them simmer ONE HOUR.  They cook faster than most beans and are very tender at this one hour time.<br /><br />Benefits: (according to a web site)<br />In addition to being a good source of fiber, Anasazi beans are also an excellent source of potassium, folic acid and iron. While dry beans are known to contain certain carbohydrates that cause flatulence, the Anasazi bean has been found to contain less than 25 percent of these complex carbohydrates, making them much easier on the digestive system.

review/text: We got our shipment of beans and realized it would make at most 5 servings. That worked out to be about $5 per serving - a bit expensive for beans when you get can mix medley beans for $2 a bag. While we love the taste of the beans, labeling them "gourmet" may not justify the extra cost. They're beans. Fortunately I did some internet searching and found a 3-pound bag for about $14. We'll be going elsewhere next time.

review/text: I love lemon lime Gatorade, I use it when I lift weights and it helps me to stay focused and move through sets.<br /><br />But I agree with one of the other reviewers. This specific product (Gatorade 76oz G Series Lemon Lime powder) is hideously overpriced. I love Amazon and normally find great deals here. But, in the case of this product, I went to Smart & Final last night and bought 2 (TWO) of these for $20 +tax. That's $9.99 each. Seriously. Sellers on ebay are also overcharging for this product.

review/summary: Good product, but too expensive on Amazon
review/text: Gatorade made from the powder mix doesn't taste syrupy like store-bought Gatorade does.  It's also much less expensive to mix your own -- think about it, why would you pay for a bottle of water + flavor syrup?  HOWEVER, the prices for this product on Amazon and eBay are very inflated.  I found it at my local grocery store (HEB) for about $7, which was on sale from about $8.  The online prices are ridiculous.

review/text: I mix this Gatorade and refill them into Powerade bottles because I find the bottles to be highly reusable.  This is a good product but you can get this for less than $10 Costco, Sam's Club or Smart and Final.<br /><br />Recycling is a good idea but reducing the use of recyclable plastics is even a better idea.  Plus, if you are in California, CRV is 5 cents per bottle.  If you drink gallons of Gatorade, I assume this is true because you are shopping for a mix for 9 gallons, it is a huge cost savings.

review/summary: Super !
review/text: Gatorade is SUPER b/c its sort of difficult to find at a small grocery store when that's all thats available in your area .  This is very PRICEY via Amazon though per gallon mix;  I don't have a Sam's Club membership or anything where I can buy in bulk like this product normally is available.<br /><br />For product taste;  I think the taste is just fine as it's the trademark Gatorade & mixed in proportion its really great to replace electrolites and fluids when you're exerting from exercise or the heat of summer.  It's caffeine free and loads of sugar when mixed as directed  ( I dillute this in 1/2 to get just 11 sugars vs 22 )  I think this price is realitively decent for making 94 servings if not double that if dilluted to 188 and makes alot of lemon lime juice for big reunions/summer picinics vs. soda pop which is very expensive & difficult to haul carbonated fluid to an event.<br /><br />Contents are 12 fluid ounces = 80 calories, 150 sodium, 45 potassium, 150 sodium, 21 carbs, 21 sugars.  Ingredients are :  Sucrose, dextrose, citric acid, natural and artifical flavors, salt, sodium citrate, monopotassium phosphate, calcium silicate, modified food starch, yellow 5.<br />It's a better choice than soda pop.  5 stars on Gatorade

review/summary: More adjustable and environmentally correct than Gatorade in packets
review/text: While I had ordered the packets of Gatorade from Amazon several times, and they certainly are convenient, they take up a lot of space, and all those empty packets can't be good for the environment.  Also, bike and other hydration bottles are not "one quart", as the packets are, making it difficult to carry Gatorade in its proper concentration in a water bottle. This canister makes 36 quarts, which to me is economical.<br />Some other reviewers claim to have obtained bargains on these canisters, and maybe they have, but this is a good deal without the uncertainty of looking for a closeout.

You can make one quart at at time, or more.<br /><br />Electrolyte drinks like Gatorade are highly recommended during and after physical activity and for dehydration.

review/summary: great scones- a few recipe suggestions
review/text: these scones are absolutely fantastic. i have been looking for a great alternative to starbucks scones for a while and this is it.  first off, i used 4 tbsp of whipped smart balance instead of butter and a tablespoon of soy creamer instead of milk.  this worked well, but just a warning: these scones are slightly savory/salty due to the black pepper and sea salt in the mix.  I found the finished product to be a tad salty (i think the smart balance added salt) so before baking a second time i sprinkled A LOT of turbinado sugar all over the top- problem solved. if you use regular, unsalted butter this may not be as much of an issue.<br /><br />i know that using cubed chilled butter is crucial in regular scones, but here, i found that allowing the smart balance/butter to warm up a bit first helped keep the scones moist while baking.  instead of cutting the butter in with a knife, i threw the cubes in there and made crumbs with my hands. using my hands warmed the butter up a bit more and helped incorporate it into the mix and there were no dry portions.  i think this also helped keep them moist and there was no grainy texture whatsoever when i tried them.<br /><br />before baking, i actually shaped the dough ball into a round disk with thick sides. my disk was about the size of the center of a salad plate.  i then refrigerated the dough overnight and cut them into 4 triangle-ish shapes in the morning.<br /><br />baking a larger scone kept them moist and they looked/tasted exactly like my old starbucks favorites.  they had that nice high, cracked side and the top had a crust and shine from the sugar.  i served them with some pumpkin butter on the side- delicious.<br /><br />buy this product- you will not be disappointed!

review/text: This food is a lifesaver. My cat loves it. He howls for more just an hour after eating! He isn't vomiting or drinking unhealthy amounts of water anymore. I tried another brand when the shipper failed to send my second delivery in a timely manner and my cat turned his pink nose up at it. This food is stinky, but my cat and I are happy to have it.<br /><br />If the secondary seller, PREMIUM PETS ETC comes up when you try to purchase this, run, don't walk away from the shopping cart. I ordered 3 additional cases from them when I had one week of food left. Although he charged my credit card immediately, it took him 6 full days to ship the product and he couldn't provide tracking info to me. His office phone mail is often full so you can't call for an update. Since he was so late in sending the food out (with NO communication of the problem, I had to chase HIM down), I requested an upgrade to overnight shipping. PREMIUM PETS ETC rep told me he couldn't upgrade because he'd already shipped it, then refused to provide the shipping confirmation despite my continued requests for the #. When the package arrived, I found that he was lying, he didn't ship it until late that night when he said he shipped in the morning. HORRIBLE customer service.<br /><br />Amazon should be ashamed to be associated with such an unprofessional seller. It's really sad because this is a product which is needed for medical purposes. Because of PREMIUM PETS ETC's poor service, my cat was sick all weekend when I couldn't get to the vet to buy other food because he was still promising he had shipped it when he hadn't. When the food still didn't arrive, 8 days after my order was placed, I had to take off work to go buy other food, losing income on what was supposed to be an easy online transaction. I can't say enough bad things about PREMIUM PETS ETC.

review/summary: My picky eater old kitty loves this stuff!
review/text: I have a 17 yr old cat who needs special food for her old lady kidney-- she runs and eats all of this food whenever I put it out. It's pretty expensive, the cans really aren't that big, but if she's happy, I'm happy. There's definitely something about the morsels that makes this more appealing than the pate style food. My cat likes this much more than hi-tor.

It tastes great, and goes down smooth.  It gives me energy for hours.  I search all the gas stations and convenience stores constantly hoping that they will sell this product again, but alas I resort to Amazon for them.

review/text: I suppose the fear I have of 'energy' drinks is that they might make me jittery or that I would crash hard after the rush wears off.<br /><br />I have no fear with this one, however. I think that I will keep some around just in case I need an eye-opener to get me out the door early when I do not have time to make a pot of coffee.<br /><br />I tried this today and the taste was very good, very much like a soda and not like some other energy drinks that taste really vile. It is also not thick and syrupy. It also really got me going without making me jittery so that I could safely drive a pretty long distance in the dark and fog.

review/text: I chose this in the hopes that it would be a "different" type of energy drink.  I have always shied away from them before because of the vitaminy taste that remains after consuming one.  This particular dring tasted of tangerines and did have the vitamin taste but it was not overpowering while drinking it and went down smoothly.  I am an ardent coffee-drinker and have the benefits of drinking coffee to keep me awake works far better than any energy drink.  I was hoping that the No Fear would prove me wrong but, unfortunately I was left with the same aftertaste and little to no energy boost.  I would not recommend it more than I would any other energy drink brand.

review/summary: Great flavor, nice kick
review/text: I've never been a big fan of the flavor of energy drinks. To me their flavors are usually "cherries dipped in gasoline" or "lemon/lime bile". But this is where No Fear is different. It tastes great! I personally think it is a sort of grapefruity flavor, but it is really hard to put your finger on it.<br /><br />I've found this to be a great afternoon pick-me-up. The extra energy usually kicks in pretty quick and hangs out for quite a while. Of course, I drink the whole can in one sitting even though it says it is two servings. I've always found that odd and everyone should make sure to take those extra calories (and the extra caffeine) into account when they drink it.<br /><br />In my opinion: the best tasting energy drink on the market!

review/summary: Real Tasty but That's It
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the clean, sparky taste of No Fear.  It was clean and did not leave much aftertaste.  That, however, is the best part and the super energy part is unavailable for me to define and address with specificity.  On consecutive days I split the 16 oz can into two drinks just before going out for my test period which lasted about 4 hours each.  I was careful to isolate my physical, emotional and mental health for the several days preceding my test period.<br /><br />(Please keep in mind that those items are purely subjective and so are my feelings about No Fear.  Sadly, it is close to impossible to accomplish and objective comparisons with one can of supplement.  Even though the promo suggests that there are 12 cans in the study I only received one.)<br /><br />The high amount of caffeine did not add any detectable energy.  My coffee intake prior to leaving is usually about the same as in No Fear.  Thirty three grams of sugar in a serving (8 oz) should produce a significant increase in energy but I did not notice any.  None of the normal aches and pains reflected any improvements.<br /><br />In short, a great tasting drink with questionable and unproven claims just does not justify the cost per serving.

review/summary: OK but Not Convinced
review/text: In general, I have not had good experiences with energy drinks.  Although I like the lift they give on a long day at work, they usually taste so awful I just avoid them.  The only exception was with Monster Java which had various iced coffee flavors and tasted good and gave a good jolt.  Unfortunately, Monster Java is not as common but I keep hoping maybe I'll find an energy drink that won't taste like carbonated cough syrup.<br /><br />No Fear is the latest candidate and it actually wasn't totally disgusting.  At first it actually was pretty good as it had a bit of a sour taste and not the sickly sweet flavor common in such fare.  But about a third of the way through, I started picking up a rather unpleasant aftertaste.  Not as bad as some, mind you ... but enough to make you think twice about a repeat performance.  As far as the kick it gives, it is not as strong as some I have had but not as weak as others.  Basically about average and there was no major crash at the end.  Of course, such evaluations tend to vary with personal body chemistry.<br /><br />Overall, while No Fear is certainly not horrible and is actually drinkable, it was not enough to stop me from looking for something better.

Between Rockstar and Monster I think Rockstar Punched is far superior if that helps judge the flavor.<br /><br />I didn't get jittery or wired with this, but then again I only had one.<br /><br />One thing it didn't do was upset my stomach like some energy drinks - so that is a plus.<br /><br />All and all I didn't think it was any better than what I already drink.

review/summary: A Good Tasting Pick Me Up
review/text: Admittedly I'm not a fan of that ubiquitous Red Bull stuff.  In fact, I never take any energy supplement at all.  It would be nice to have a "go-to" type safe and tasty energy drink for the times when a cup of coffee just won't cut it.  Enter No Fear.  I immediately liked the taste of this stuff.  It slightly reminded me a an non-alcoholic non-energy drink I used to drink when if was around 12 to 15 years old which was called "Apple Beer".  Basically it had a nice grape/apple base with good fizz and so does No Fear.  No Fear gave me a noticeable lift after I drank half of the can.  I did not need to actually consume the entire can to get the benefit and, as mentioned, I liked the taste.  If it wasn't fairly high in calories I would not hesitate to consume the entire can at one time (this could be a help if after strenuous activity you were feeling shaky and needed some fuel/calories).<br /><br />All told, a tasty energy drink that delivers what the category promises:  a real noticeable lift without making you gag.  I would buy this stuff.

review/text: Not being a huge energy drink guy, my reviews for these have a lot to do with taste.  Considering energy drinks go from toxic sugar water to super fruity mess, its hard finding a decent one.<br /><br />With that in mind, No Fear Super Energy is just okay.  It has a bit of a mango taste to it, which I don't mind at all.  As far as energy goes, it does what it advertises it does: gives you a nice shot of energy for 3-4 hours.  Surprisingly, there was no "downer" on this one either, so that was a nice change from Monsters.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent little energy drink that will probably be even more favorable if you like mango.

It gives you the jitters just like any other energy drink on the shelf these days if you don't drink them on a regular basis.  This is not one that I frequently see in the refrigerated drink section at the grocery store for some reason.  At $28/12 cans, that's about $2.33 each.  Comparatively, RB is $39.99 here on Amazon for the same quantity.  Unless you are a fanboi or just have to have that taste, this will cost less in the long run.

review/summary: Not For Me
review/text: I was really excited to try this and I work at 3 am once a week. I usually take an AMP energy drink with me which I enjoy and works quite well, but I thought I would try this one. It was not a good experience for me. The morning that I drank it, I really needed. I did not get much sleep at all (probably about 2 hours) and I was tired. I started sipping on the the drink and I started feeling nauseous. I don't know if the nausea was because I was really tired (I tend to get nauseous whe I'm tired) or if it was from the drink itself (after I read the label I saw it had 1,000mg of Taurine compared to the 173mg in the AMP. But I decided to stop drinking it and switched to an AMP afterwards and my nausea went away.<br /><br />So, this is not a drink that I will have again, and I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get the chance to see if it actually worked or not. But compared to other energy drinks, the taste wasn't that bad. It wasn't my favorite, but it was a lot better tasting than other drinks that are on the market.

review/text: They don't actually tell you what the flavor of this stuff is supposed to be but it's not bad but it's not easy to point out the actual flavor either. I gave a taste to several people and got responses from sour apple, jolly rancher apple, grape, and a few others... It seems no one really knows what it is but no one complained about the flavor either.<br /><br />It seems to have a nice mix of ingredients that it doesn't give you a rush of energy but it does keep you awake through the day. I spent half the day just sipping on a can and it really does seem to do it's job without the rush like some other energy drinks will give you. That's a major bonus for me as I really don't like that rush. Overall it's a great product and I'm glad I got to test it out. I will certainly have to get me some so that I can have this instead of the ones I used to drink that I had to stop because of the crazy rush they would give me.<br /><br />I'll have to admit that I'm impressed with this brand and the fact someone actually put out a good energy drink that gives you energy and not a rush.

review/summary: The Taste is Good... but is the Science?
review/text: This drink tastes fine as energy drinks go but is really nothing special. Sweetened by high fructose corn syrup, made tart with citric acid, some grape juice concentrate and other flavors added. 87 mg caffeine per serving and two servings per can. The black can with the angry and fractured skull [with wings on it] will appeal to certain people while turning others off. Marketing is everything with energy drinks. There isn't much science to support them beyond the caffeine improving endurance and concentration a bit. Simple coffee may be the better and cheaper choice for those wanting a boost. Many added ingredients are in very low amounts and should have little effect if any. There is a gram of taurine per serving, but the science supporting its use for an energy boost is not at all compelling.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Carbonated Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Citric Acid, Taurine, Grape Juice Concentrate, Sodium Citrate, Natural Flavor, Inositol, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Sodium Hexametaphosphate (to Protect Flavor), Caffeine, Monopotassium Phosphate, Caramel Color, Sodium Benzoate (Preserves Freshness), Grape Seed Extract, L-Carnitine, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, L-Arginine Hydrochloride, Zinc Methionine Sulfate, Soy Protein Isolate and Rice Flour, Guarana (Paullinia Caruna), Seed Extract, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Calcium Disodium EDTA (to Protect Flavor), Selenium Complexed with Amino Acids and Polypeptides, Folic Acid, Cyanocobalamin.<br /><br />This beverage is a high sugar[260 calories per can] soft drink with a gram of taurine per serving added and perhaps twice the caffeine of the average caffeinated soft drink. It has less caffeine per ounce than brewed coffee. If you like the taste and don't mind paying much more for a few cents worth of caffeine and some other ingredients of questionable value ... enjoy it!  For most people caffeine presents little trouble... used in moderation. But anxiety, heart palpitations, high blood pressure and digestive troubles can follow slamming too much caffeine from any sources... go easy! Peace.

review/summary: Decent Enough - I prefer low cal versions
review/text: The only fear I had in trying out this No Fear energy drink was the fact that it was the fully loaded calorie version (I normally drink low cal versions to spare my tire a bit).  I shrugged off the calories and chugged down this drink.  Taste was actually pretty good - not to overpowering and not too weak - kind of a generic non-offensive taste.  As for energy - nothing too noticeable for me, maybe just a bit of an extra pick-me-up from the full sugar version.<br /><br />Net, net I would drink this again if it was laying around (such as in a buddy's fridge).  But, I wouldn't buy it myself - at $2.50 per pop I would just stick with my tried and true brands such as Monster Lo Carb.  At a lower than major brand price point I might be more inspired.

review/text: Let me just say this stuff gives you what you want in an energy drink. While not the very best tasting energy drink on the market, I don't think any other drink give you a kick in the behind like this one does & to be absolutely truthful, taste is not what you buy these for. If you need a jump start pick one of these bad boys up & hold on! Most highly recommended!

review/summary: Nothing outstanding
review/text: No Fear Super Energy Supplement is a big can. Well, about the size of Monster or Rock Star, but if you aren't accustomed to drinking energy drinks, start with something smaller like a baby Red Bull. The first thing that struck me about No Fear was the taste. Sort of a shock, really. I have always, in my mind, compared the taste of all energy drinks to melted Sweet Tart candy, if you've ever had any of that. But No Fear definitely has a more fruity taste that I would compare to sweetened grapefruit. May not appeal to everyone. As far as an energy boost, I really didn't notice one, despite the can being so big that it has over 2 servings in it, and despite the ingredients being pretty much the same as most energy drinks on the market. Some energy drinks get me wired for hours, but not this one. If it did affect me at all, it just wasn't measurable to me. But it's worth a try, at least once.

review/text: I drank the entire can in one sitting, but didn't feel any sort of boost in energy. I'm not sure what the effects were, but the taste was decent. Like any other energy drinks.<br /><br />I'd recommend another energy drink that actually gives you a boost, though.

review/summary: No fear, unless you're scared of dishwater.
review/text: I cracked this open to share with my boyfriend the other day.<br />First, I just put some in two glasses, chilled, over ice.  His reaction:  "Good heavens, this tastes like dishwater!"  Mine: "Meh, it's not that bad, but it's nothing to write home about."<br />I took two new glasses and poured some over ice, and added a shot of vanilla vodka.  This yielded the same results.<br />Two more new glasses...this time chocolate vodka.  Better.<br />Now we're out of No Fear drink...and neither of us are bemoaning that fact.  This just didn't have the "oomph" that other "amped" sodas have.  It lacked flavor.<br />One good thing:  It was not over-carbonated.  I am not a big fan of majorly carbonated beverages, and this had just a little.<br /><br />If you're looking for a GREAT "amped" drink, look no further than GoFast.  [...]  I  wish Amazon carried it.  This stuff tastes GREAT, is not too bad for you, and mixes very well with the different flavored vodkas.  (Mixed with chocolate, it's a cherry cordial.)

review/summary: Not bad, but won't make me change brands
review/text: I frequently drink energy drinks and have tried most of the major and some of the lesser known brands. This "No Fear" one is decent, really nothing with it, but also nothing great. The drink contains 87mg of caffeine per serving (take note, a can contains 2 servings!), which is about average, as well as the usual mix of vitamins and other energy-boosting supplements. The taste is comparable to what you'd expect from an energy drink - you probably wouldn't pick these things up because they taste great, after all.<br /><br />All in all, there's nothing much that sets this drink apart from the pack, and because of that I'd rather go for the brands I am already familiar with. (My personal favorite, by the way, is the orange "Hydration" version of Rockstar, which actually tastes surprisingly close to orange soda, has a lower sugar content so it doesn't dehydrate you as badly as other energy drinks, and still gives you a solid boost!)

review/text: I use energy drinks to get rid of migraines.  On that front, No Fear is great!  In fact, I can only drink half a can at a time, or I get jitters (and I'm fairly immune that type of caffeine effect from drinking a daily Red Bull).<br /><br />I also love the peachy (or maybe mango) flavor.  This is a drink I really like.

review/summary: Better Tasting, Less Energy, Big 16oz Can....
review/text: Ive tried a few other brand energy drinks and never liked the taste of any. Regardless I would drink the horrible tasting drinks to have the energy without the crash when needed and they did work. I found this No Fear Super Energy Supplement to give the same amount of energy but alot more to drink. The taste was not as bad though as the others - it was decently flavored and ok to drink rather then horrible tasting. It has a cherry flavor taste like cola. It is a 16 ounce can though compared to some 2oz drinks so there is alot more to drink. Keep in mind though the can is 2 servings... I prefer the smaller bottles to a big can.<br /><br />When I compare this to 5 hour energy the ones I am use to the flavor is far better with this drink. BUT its alot more can to drink to feel an affect which I actually then prefer the nasty tasting stuff as its a quick gulp and thats it... rather then a whole can to down. I feel more energized wit ha 5 hour energy, you can totally feel the difference. I did not have that same affect with this- it felt like it was starting to work and I was waiting for that full blown kick in energy but it never came. I can take a 5 hour when exhausted and I'm wide awake and alert for 5 hours no problem. With this I  could still head to bed if I desired.<br /><br />I do like the look of the can, its pretty cool looking but, what matters is inside the can. Energy drinks work differently for everyone. I'd recommend trying a few just a can or 2 from each til you find what works best for you. For me, its still 5 hour energy

review/summary: Just another energy drink... tastes slightly better than average.
review/text: I drank one of these in the morning before going surfing. I had a slight hangover from the night before and was a little groggy. This didn't give me the extreme energy boost you'd get from pre-workout powder like Muscletech Neurocore, Fruit Punch, .42 lbs (189 Grams) (which I have also reviewed), but it did help wake me up a bit.<br /><br />A nice thing about this stuff is it actually tastes pleasant. Sort of a fruity, pink lemonade-y kind of flavor. Almost too sweet, but that's better than the awful metal/syrup flavor of a lot of other energy sodas.<br /><br />I typically don't drink this kinds of things, preferring coffee when I need a boost in the morning, but this wasn't too bad. If you are an energy drink person and regularly pound Monster or Rockstar or Red Bull, etc. it might be worth giving this a shot. It's got the caffeine of about 1.5-2 cups of coffee and is a nice flavor alternative to some of the other energy drinks out there.

review/summary: I'm afraid No Fear is not for me
review/text: Here's what No Fear energy drink is: some kind of liquid, dyed some awful color, filled with sugar, caffeine, and a bunch of "energizing" chemicals ending with "-ine", packing 260 calories and a taste somewhere between an unripe strawberry and window cleaner. Does it give you "energy"? Sure, just like anything else that contains 260 calories worth of sugar. Is it good for you? I doubt it. If you are a fan of Red Bull, Monster, and similar drinks, I suppose No Fear will be right up there with those. If you're trying to eat right, lose weight and not get strung out on a bunch of chemicals, an apple or maybe a cup of coffee will probably give you just as much of a pick me up, without all the unpronounceable additives. Three stars for doing what it says it does, but No Fear is not my cup of taurine.

review/summary: Taste fruity, but if you drink coffee you won't feel a thing
review/text: I drink about 24 ounces of coffee in the morning and love espresso.  I also take thermogenics to get a boost of energy so I am always jacked up on caffeine.  For me, these energy drinks don't really give me any boost of energy.  There is a good amount of caffeine in this can, and each can contains 2 servings.  It's a huge can, and actually taste good.  It reminds me of a pomegranate fruit drink.<br /><br />I liked the taste of the drink, and if you are a light coffee drinker, it might give you some energy.  It didn't do anything for me but might work for you.  Give it a shot if you can find it in stores.

It was very sweet like most energy drinks are, but it was loaded with B12 and B6 vitamins, which I liked. It gave me energy and got me through my workday. I could concentrate and work easily without feeling over stimulated or jittery.  As far as energy drinks go, it did its job well. I would recommend it for anyone interested in a little boost in his or her day.

review/text: After having tried many energy drinks over time this one claims to be a Super Supplement.  I would say it works, it makes you feel like you had a bunch of coffee but it tastes sour.  The flavor I had was a fruit punch but it was tart and just very sour, not something I would try again. It may taste better mixed with something or with ice but I only tried it straight from the can.

review/text: From the can, I expected No Fear to be a rather masculine drink. The logo and font suggests a manly drink. I was very surprised to find No Fear had a sweet, peachy taste, like a thin, carbonated peach schnapps. It was smooth, refreshing and very pleasant to drink, but didn't quite match the packaging.<br /><br />No Fear felt as effective an energy drink as a Rockstar or Monster (both come in the same size cans). I drink Rockstars fairly regularly and No Fear gave me more or less the same experience. Its taste is a bit more distinctive than a Rockstar though, so it would be more appropriate (for my tastes at least) as an occasional energy drink rather than your regular brand.

The can was pretty cool looking nice graphic design.<br /><br />As for energy I consumed after I got out of work from job one around 4 in the afternoon and went to job two filled with energy and then came home still had plenty of energy to sit and read till 2 in the morning. Sort of sucked knowing i had to get up at 6 and do it all again. So I think this energy drink will be fine for weekend use.<br /><br />Would like to find in stores but might have order from here.

review/summary: Another Energy Drink
review/text: I've had Red Bull, Monster Lo Carb, and Five Hour Energy before.  They all seem more or less alike to me.  Each has a somewhat medicinal taste and gives me a bit of a boost for a few hours.  No Fear energy drink is comparable.  The flavor of this one is fruitier than Red Bull or Monster Lo Carb, but it still has a distinctly medicinal and somewhat bitter taste behind the initial sweetness.  The can contains two servings, but there is no way to preserve the carbonation once it's open.  So you're getting a double dose whether you like it or not.<br /><br />I haven't seen this in stores in my area.  I might try it again if I come across it, depending on how it's priced compared to the similar products out there.

review/summary: Tastes good, effects comparable to Red Bull and Monster
review/text: Some of the negative comments by other reviewers about the taste of No Fear Super Energy Supplement led me to expect the worst from the 16 ounce sample I received for review purposes, but to my surprise I liked the taste. I really liked it. I drank the entire can in place of my afternoon cup of coffee one day (which would've been 16 ounces made very strong with freshly ground Peet's French or Italian roast beans), and got a stronger, longer lasting buzz than the coffee would've given me, with no undesirable side effects (e.g., no jitters and no feeling that my heart was racing) or after effects (e.g., no "crashing").<br /><br />Each 16 ounce can of NFSES contains 2 servings, so one can contains 174 milligrams of caffeine. According to the Mayo Clinic, 16 ounces of Starbucks Pike Place brewed coffee contains 330 milligrams of caffeine, nearly twice the amount of caffeine in 16 ounces of NFSES.<br /><br />One thing that brewed coffee does not contain that NFSES and many other energy drinks contain is taurine. A 16 ounce can of NFSES contains 2000 milligrams of taurine, which is approximately the same amount of taurine found in 16 ounces of Red Bull.<br /><br />Taurine is an amino acid that was first isolated from ox bile in 1827, and the name taurine comes from the Latin word "taurus" (as in the astrological sign) for bull or ox. (The taurine in energy drinks is synthetic.) I recently purchased a bottle of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LRYD0">Now Foods Taurine 1000Mg, 100-Capsules</a>. According to NOW Foods, taurine "supports a calm mood" or has a "relaxing effect on the mood" (statements that come with the disclaimer that the FDA has not evaluated these statements). And indeed that is my experience when I take one or two 1000 milligram taurine caps without drinking any caffeinated beverage. And so I am led to wonder why taurine is a major ingredient in so many energy drinks. Dr. Neil L. Harrison, who is a professor of pharmacology and anesthesiology at Columbia University says, "Its inclusion in these supplements is a little puzzling, because our research would suggest ... [that] taurine actually would have more of a sedative effect on the brain." (Source: Cornell University Chronicle Online, "Scientists close in on taurine's activity in the brain" 2/13/08.) (According to a 2004 article in Medical News Today titled, "French ban on Red Bull (drink) upheld by European Court," Red Bull claims that taurine can kick-start the metabolism, which may thus be the reason it is included in so many energy drinks. The French ban Red Bull was lifted in 2008: "The drink had been banned in France for twelve years due to health authorities' concerns about unknown consequences of the ingredient taurine, a chemical forbidden in several countries. Until now a modified version of the drink, containing caffeine but not taurine, was on sale in France." Source: Reuters article, "France ends 12-year ban on energy drink Red Bull," 7/15/08)<br /><br />Until now a modified version of the drink, containing caffeine but not taurine, was on sale in France.)<br /><br />A 16 ounce can of No Fear Super Energy Supplement has 260 calories, which is about the same number of calories found in two 12 ounce servings of beer (beer calories vary by brand), one MacDonald's hamburger (250 calories), or one 2 ounce Snicker's candy bar (266 calories). A 16 ounce can of Sugar Free Red Bull has 20 calories.<br /><br />I can't imagine that anyone would want to order a whole 12-pack of NFSES without first trying it to know if they find it palatable and to get a sense of how it affects them.

review/summary: Does the Trick
review/text: No Fear certainly does the "energy boost" trick very nicely.  Taste-wise... I generally find Monster and Red Bull to be too sweet: I would rather drink a regular (diet, high-caffeine) soda.  I really like Sobe Adrenaline Rush, which is probably the "least sweet" of the energy drinks.  (I also like NOS Citrus, but that's just because I grew up on Mtn Dew).  All in all, since price is an issue with energy drinks, I usually go with what's on sale.  With that in mind, even though it isn't my favorite, No Fear is absolutely good enough that I'll buy it if it's the least expensive option on the shelf.

review/summary: Fear
review/text: No Fear,Super Energy Supplement, 16-Ounce Cans<br /><br />No fear energy drink was tasty and it did have caffeine that gave it a kick to keep you going through the day. It had a high sugar content of 20 MGs. I think that's a little high which made it a little too sweet for my taste. However I know there are people out there that truly like sugar and prefer it in their coffee and tea. Not me! I like something more tart. I truly prefer coffee for a jump start and some of the other drinks to get an actual juice flavor. "No fear" had a fruity taste to it which was probably wears some of the vitamin B content came from. The price seemed a little high so for me I would have to give it three stars and nothing more. I could only drink this in a pinch.<br /><br />If you're going to try this drink then my recommendation would be to use it very judiciously and take the cost factor into account when you're drinking it.

review/summary: The taste test was a draw in our household
review/text: I'm a thirty-something Mom that limits my energy drink intake.  Not because I can't use the extra energy, but because I normally don't care for the taste.  My boyfriend is forty-something and drinks energy drinks on a daily basis, usual right before his evening workout.  He prefers sugar free ones, but occasionally buys the regular versions.  My daughter is a high school senior who likes energy drinks and consumes 3-4 a week, to help keep up with her busy schedule. She doesn't seem to be picky about them; sugar-free, regular, carbonated, pretty much whatever is on sale.  So I decided that we would all try out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO6NI8">No Fear,Super Energy Supplement</a> and to do so I purchased a 2nd can so that we could each have a full serving, which is 8 ounces.  After taste testing, these were the results.<br /><br />Me - I liked the flavor, which surprised me.  It was fruity, without being too much.  There was an aftertaste that I didn't care for though.  I drank mine in the morning and I did feel like I had the same level of energy as my normal 2 cups of coffee and no jittery feelings.  Overall I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Boyfriend - He didn't care for the flavor at all.  He said he smelled mango, which is something he hates. He of course didn't care for the high sugar content and said he couldn't see himself ever buying this brand. Energy wise, he said it did it's job just fine. From someone that drinks energy drinks daily, his opinion definitely had me listening. He gave it 2 of 5 stars.<br /><br />Daughter - She liked the flavor, energy level, but didn't care for the can design. (Remember she's a teenage girl so they think of these things.)  She did say that these were priced higher than her usual couple brands so that would be a factor in any future purchases. She ended up giving it 3 out of 5 stars.

review/summary: Similar to NOS or Orangina in flavor.
review/text: There isn't a lot to say about an energy drink.  This particular No Fear drinks follows the well charted waters of other similar 16oz energy drinks in composition and expected level of effectiveness.  Where this one goes the less traveled route is in its flavor.  To my knowledge only this and NOS opt for a citrus flavor akin to sodas like Slice, Fresca, or Orangina rather than that all too familiar Red Bull and Monster "is that Taurine?" flavor.  That, in and of itself, makes it a much better tasting drink and considerably easier to drink to me.  To that end I thought this was a pretty good drink which I would buy again or recommend.  Still dramatically high in sugar and arguably unhealthy in general but a good tasting and easy drinkin' energy drink no less.

review/summary: Nice Flavor, Not So Great Energy
review/text: When I first opened the can, I caught a whiff of the aroma and thought something had gone bad in the can.  It was truly unappetizing.  I tried a sip anyway, and it tasted fine, so I ventured forth.  The taste is best described as a sweeter Red Bull.  The carbonation isn't overly done, so it has some fizz, but not like a soda, which is also good.<br /><br />It contains 100% daily RDA for several things, including vitamin C, but then no one drinks an energy drink to ward off the common cold.  The true test is the energy boost, and for No Fear I found little of that.  Actually, all I really got was a headache (I am not caffeine sensitive.  I don't drink energy drinks daily, but I have had them about once a week without headaches.).  I'm willing to believe that this headache was a coincidence, but I did deduct stars for the lack of energy in an energy drink.<br /><br />So, overall, bad aroma, nice taste, poor energy.

review/summary: OK drink, ambiguous flavor
review/text: I was given one can of "No Fear, Super Energy" to try out for this review.  At the outset I should say that I am not a regular energy drink fan, though I have indulged on occasion, largely out of necessity, when I was desperate for energy or forced to stay awake all night.  I have always viewed such drinks as a little bit dangerous and largely a necessary evil but one that is clearly needed during this day and age.  I've never been a fan of the taste, but it's difficult to argue with the burst of energy that such drinks provide.  That said, this "No Fear" big can -- each can containts two servings -- was just OK, no better and no worse than any of the other drinks I have occasionally tried and largely disliked over the years.<br /><br />A few reviewers have described the taste as cola-like or even fruity, and I think that says a lot about the rather, well, ambiguous flavor.  The one thing that I can certainly agree with is the utterly unpleasant aftertaste that tingles like a vitamin or pill that you accidentally bit into before swallowing.  Now, did it increase my energy?  Of course, as any huge jolt of caffeine to my system would do.  Would I try it again?  Well, as I said, I'm not a fan of energy drinks but recognize the occasional need for one.  If I was in need and "No Fear" was handy, sure, I'd drink it again.  Would I choose it over another brand?  No.  There is no real difference in my opinion.  Of course, if you're a fan of energy drinks -- as many of these reviewers are -- your mileage may vary.  This might be the best or worst tasting energy drink ever.  Much like the flavor, it's all very ambiguous.

review/text: I  normally resort to coffee based drinks to get my morning started, however, I decided to try out No Fear Super Energy.<br /><br />I have tried the major energy drinks such as Spyder, Red Bull, and Monster.  This one has a taste along those lines.  It was very sugary and carbonated with a grape/citrusy taste.  Shockingly, the vitamins in the drink account for 100% of your daily value for Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin B12.  I must say that it did not get me jittery, but at the same time it did not completely "pep" me up either.  The bad thing is the can I purchased was 16oz which was two servings and 260 calories!  Knowing that, I do not think this will be my go to daily morning drink.

review/summary: Hey, the can has a cool look and I like the taste... but....
review/text: Hey, going on a juicing health kick this year has me try and stay away from energy drinks, but still I sometimes feel the need for a boost.  My standard drink is the green label monster, and I can get it at sale prices in the 16 ounce cans for about a dollar on sale.  I buy a lot when it's on sale and when it's not I get the 2 for 3.00 deals that are frequently made at filling stations.  This is just as drinkable and provides a similar array of energizers and caffeine.<br /><br />The drink tasted to me a little like grapefruit, and I liked the flavor, but not enough to this is a special taste I want to have again!  Frankly in something as highly competitive as the soft drink market, I don't see this hanging around for long unless there is a very big player behind it and they discount it to knock out the competition.  I'm still not sure of the value of energy sodas, they appear to me to run down your health under the guise of keeping you going.  At least it's not the joke like that 5 hour thing, that doesn't even have energy just some cheap stimulants and an overblown price.<br /><br />The price on this one is frankly too much for me to consider, pretty much what the out of the vending machine price would be for a typical energy drink.  Had they sent me more than a can I'd have evaluated the drink over a few weeks, and maybe given a feel good or feel bad report, but with just the one can, I can't make any such claims.  Bottom line is cost, and cost is not very good.  That said it's not awful either, so if this makes it to the grocery, and is on sale I may buy again, just for a change of pace.

review/summary: A nice energy booster.
review/text: The No Fear energy drink is designed to give you a boost in energy when you need to be alert, or are feeling tired. I have tried several energy drinks in the past, and this one is a good option. It is highly carbonated, and it tasted a little strong to me, but it was not unpleasant by any means. I don't think that it gave a better boost than any other drink, and I don't think that it is the best tasting, but it does work. So for that I do give it four stars. If you can get it cheap it is worth a try.

review/summary: Great taste, gives a good sugar / caffeine rush
review/text: I don't drink a lot of energy drinks but when I do then I normally reach for a NOS because of its great citrus taste. I have tried a handful of other energy drinks and I haven't liked the taste of them at all. No Fear Super Energy has a similar taste to NOS and I really like it as well. I would describe the flavor as a very sweet and smooth grapefruit taste. If you are looking for a sugar / caffeine rush then this will get the job done at the expense of high calorie count. I found that this 16 oz. can will give me a nice boost of energy for 4-5 hours.

review/summary: "No Fear, Super Energy Supplement, 16-Ounce cans" (Pack of 12)
review/text: This drink contains a lot of ingredients, many that I was happy to see, such as Vitamins C,B6, B12, Zinc, Selenlum, Folic Acid and Potassium, as well as their Proprietary Blend which includes Taurine, Inositol, Grape Seed Extrace, L-Carnitine and L-Arginine.  Was not happy that it contained Caffeine, Sodium, corn syrup, soy and sugar--For this reason, I would not purchase this as a "health drink."  This drink has sort of a citrus taste and goes down easy when cold.  Eight fluid ounces of this drink is 34 total carbs, so most people would want to drink this 16 FL OZ can in two servings.  This product made me a little sick to my stomach, but I was far from being wired.  I do not plan on purchasing this product in the future, because of the salt, caffeine, sugar, and because 16 FL Oz is just too much to drink at one time.

review/text: I got sort of a grapefruit taste out of it with a little of that energy drink type aftertaste. The aftertaste wasn't as pronounced as I had experienced with other drinks either, I really liked that fact. After drinking the can I did get a boost in energy. I didn't notice any crash later on either. I wouldn't say this is my favorite energy drink but it wasn't bad either.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: I am not too familiar with energy drinks, so my experience is somewhat limited. I was feeling pretty draggy at around 6pm, and it was a Friday night, so I felt like I needed a boost. The can said it had 2 servings, but I went ahead and downed the whole thing. Within a minute or so, my head was tingling and my eyes were like saucers. Is this normal?? I don't know if it was a placebo effect or if this stuff actually had an effect on me. It might have also had something to do with the video game I was playing, but I can't say for sure. Caffeine usually doesn't have a big effect on me... aside from causing an occasional acne flare up. (The side of the can DOES say it's not recommended for people who are sensitive to caffeine, so I'm assuming there's some caffeine in there).<br /><br />As for the taste, it wasn't wonderful, but it wasn't terrible either. It tasted like Sprite mixed with Pomegranate juice. It wasn't the best beverage I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't the worst.<br /><br />I'm happy to report I didn't have any sort of crash afterward. I don't know if it really had an effect on me, or if it was all in my head. Nevertheless, this drink certainly wouldn't be bad to try.

review/summary: New Favorite Energy Drink!
review/text: This energy drink tastes great and works great!  I am so picky about the flavors of any beverages.. I hate bad after-tastes or being able to taste the ingredients within the drink that taste like vitamins or medicine.. This drink does not have any of this.  I immediately loved the taste - almost like a fruit punch.<br /><br />I started drinking the drink (1 can of 16 oz) at lunchtime and was still going well on the energy it provided at 7:30 PM.<br /><br />I rarely drink energy drinks, but I am NOT sensitive to caffeine (drink sodas and coffee daily) - this energy drink provided a lot more energy than anything else I have tried.  When I do drink energy drinks, I normally like Redbull (ok) and Amp (better), but now I will most likely buy No Fear (best) when I need that extra boost.<br /><br />Each 16 oz can provides 2 servings at 130 calories each serving (for you health conscious people out there).  It contains Taurine, L-Carnitine, and Arginine.  Also, please note that it contains soy (for you that have this allergy).<br /><br />Overall - great taste, great energy provider... I will buy this again!

review/text: My 16 year old daughter is the queen of energy drinks.  I thought that she would be the perfect person to try this drink.  Unfortunately, she only took a sip and gave it back to me.  She said that it had almost no carbonation and tasted like grapefruit.  I decided that I would have to try it too.  Unfortunately, I had to agree with her on this one.  Although the carbonation part did not bother me (I am not fond of carbonated drinks), it did taste kind of like grapefruit...only it was sort of an "off" grapefruit and left a bit of a nasty after taste.  I am not sure that I would buy it again.

review/summary: Taste is better than some energy drinks I've tried - and it's got the usual ingredients for boosting energy
review/text: I've tried several different kinds of energy drink - and can't stand the taste of most of them. This one's not bad.  It's got a bit of a fruit-punchy flavor with only a mildly bitter aftertaste from the energy ingredients.  In fact I like it better than most I've tried, with the exception of the Arizona Az Energy drinks, which are more fruity with less bitter afterwards. It does have a lot of sugar, though: 260 calories from high fructose corn syrup and various fruit juice concentrates.  I'll try anything once, and in a pinch I'd try this one again, but next time I think I'll try the sugar free variety.

review/text: Wow, I was surprised that this can goes for nearly $28.00 for a case of 12!!  Is it worth the cost?<br /><br />The drink is full of amino acids which are helpful, but it is also full of sugar and caffeine, which are not.<br /><br />There are all sorts of warnings for children and pregnant women not drinking this stuff.  Not sure if that's real or just a tantalizing bit of danger (read: promotion & marketing ploy) to get you to buy it.<br /><br />Taste:  Doesn't have an after-taste like some energy drinks do. I did notice a bit of perk, but that's probably due to the sugar and caffeine.<br /><br />Recommendations:  Probably save your money.  Eat your chow boys and girls.  It's the protein in your meals, not the sugar, that gives lasting energy and a high metabolism.<br /><br />[I got this free on the Amazon Vine program.]

review/summary: Go For The Sugar-Free Version
review/text: Having enjoyed No Fear's Sugar-Free energy drinks for quite some time now and being offered the Super Energy Supplement via the Vine Program, I decided to give it a shot.  What I got was a can of generic energy drink with the standard generic citrus-like, lightly carbonated taste and a bizarre but brief aftertaste that I can best explain as tasting like the smell of old cigarette ashes.<br /><br />I had a sausage, egg, and cheese croissant on the morning that I consumed this drink, to give you an idea of what was in my stomach when I drank it.  I had stayed up fairly late the night before and really needed a bit of a kick.  Instead of my usual coffee, I opted for the No Fear instead.  Initially the taste isn't bad, but as I've already mentioned, there's a very, very brief and nasty aftertaste after each sip.  I drank the No Fear on my way to work after eating my breakfast and finished the entire can (all 260 calories of it) in a twenty-five minute period.<br /><br />Once I arrived at work, I allowed thirty minutes to pass before expecting any results.  I got none.  In fact, I was just as tired after drinking the No Fear as I was before drinking it.  This sort of surprised me, though, as the sugar-free version of this drink always gives me a good kick for a few hours.<br /><br />Overall, I think I'll stick with the sugar-free No Fear and only grab one of these if I'm in need of an energy drink and no Monster drinks are available.

review/summary: It Works
review/text: The No Fear energy supplement is pretty much a standard energy drink, much like Monster, Venom, and the others. The flavor itself is one that you have to get used to, just like many of the other ones of this style. It's not terrible (doesn't taste like medicine) but it's not fruit punch either. I reacted to this the way I typically react to energy drinks so I'll describe it in general terms. I am the type who is sensitive to caffeine and herbal energy blends. As such, a can like this is one I will nurse throughout the day. You need to know your limits. Some people can pound them like a bottle of beer at a party. I am not one of them. If I drink this stuff too fast it drives my heart rate up and makes me bounce off the walls, then I'm burned out when it wears off. Sipped slowly throughout the day, I don't have a problem and I can sustain the "wake-up" all day and into the evening.<br /><br />Again, be aware, too much of this stuff can be harmful. If you have anxiety problems and you pound this, it can make matters worse. Same with high blood pressure or any of that. Also, this particular one is not sugar free, so you're talking added calories. If you're watching your carb intake or your weight, go for one of the sugar free ones.

I have no idea what flavor it is supposed to be but it is tolerable.<br /><br />The definite pros are that it did work well. Each can has two servings, I downed them both after a particularly grueling workout. I'm happy to report that I did feel renewed and my energy levels lifted and kept me going for the rest of the day.<br /><br />I would use this product again - however I might add I would prefer a Full Throttle for better flavor. Also what is it with the Soy? Why is soy in this drink? To what end? So I suppose I should add that those with Soy allergies will/should take a pass on this.

Total calories per can are 260 and total carbs 68g.  Add in the fact that the second ingredient is high fructose corn syrup and that it contains soy and it's a guarantee I won't pick up another can.  Gaining short lived energy isn't worth it to me to put that kind of garbage and empty calories into my body.

review/summary: So-So
review/text: I have little experience with energy supplements, so I can only review, not compare.<br />The first aspect of any consumable is its taste.  On first gulp, one is doubtful, but as you proceed it becomes quite palatable, although not something you would probably drink for the pleasure of it.  You will find yourself trying to guess what the flavors are.  My guess: grape, cranberry, and orange.  It has a very pleasing astringent effect which I like, somewhat like Coke, but more so.<br />As to its energizing effect, I can say that it is not like the fabled NZT, but I am still awake and ready to take on my tax preparation, which would usually sap my energy for at least a few days.<br />A note of caution however.  The label says it contains 130 calories.  But if you look above that you will note that it says that a can contains two servings.  So double the calories.  Being carbonated, it is unlikely you will drink half and store the other half.  If one were to drink 260 calories of Coke or Pepsi, you might feel the same energizing effect, with a better taste.  It does however have a nice dose of several vitamins, especially B.<br />Enough said, you be the judge.

review/text: Most energy drinks don't live up to the buzz.  They taste awful and the energy boost never<br />equals the hype.  So it was with some trepidation that I tried No Fear Super energy Supplement.  One large can contains two servings so I split it with a friend.  He thought it tasted like a strong strawberry soda but didn't notice any energy boost.  I would describe the flavor as a grapefruit.It was pretty good, excellent for an energy drink with only a slight and short lasting metallic afertaste.  I too noticed no discernable difference in my energy. I am a heavy coffee drinker however my friend does not imbibe so I can't attribute the lack of effect to caffeine resistance..  So if you are looking for a change of pace flavorwise, this might satisfy.  However, if you are seeking a shot of energy, stick with coffee or coke.

Nothing special, I tend to imagine this is a drink designed to sell to the market that "No Fear" appeals to.  Not a bad drink, not my favorite either.  Only real reason to stick with it is if you are a big fan of the taste in my opinion.  But it is worth giving a try.

review/text: The flavor of this energy drink is really good, kind of like a sweet pink grapefruit juice. If you like a drink that tastes more like fruit juice instead of a flavor like Red Bull, you will like this. Although there are added vitamins, Taurine, L-Carnitine, L-Arginine, etc, I didn't notice any "vitamin-y" aftertaste. I thought it gave me a good all-day energy boost with no negative side effects like jitters or nervousness. I generally liked most things about it, but thought it was just a bit too sweet. A little less sugar would have made me give it 5 stars. Other than that, I would try this again.

I was a bit surprised to discover that each can actually contains 2 servings, at approximately 130 calories each, so it's definitely not a diet-friendly drink. Although I think the drink did provide more of a boost than a diet soda, for me, it's just not worth the extra calories on a regular basis.  That said, I would drink it again and I would recommend the drink to people who are looking for energy drinks or don't mind the calories (and sugar).

Leaves kind of a bitter taste in my mouth for an hour after drinking it which makes me feel as if I'm thirstier than before I drank it.<br /><br />Note that this is a TWO-serving can with each serving having about as much caffeine as a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Also - take my lackluster opinion with a grain of salt - I think energy beverages are a bit childish to begin with. This was the first one I ever tried.<br />If you want juice, drink juice. If you want coffee, drink coffee. If you want soda, well, you get the idea. Or maybe you just need a nap.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Bumping up a star. Saved half the can for my 19-year-old daughter and she loved it, so we'll split the difference. I give it 2, she gives it 4 or more.
