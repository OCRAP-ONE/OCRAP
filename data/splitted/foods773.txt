review/summary: Pecan Pie, 3 Ingredients, How DO they do it?!
review/text: WOW! I recently tried Lara Bar for the first time, and have tried several flavors now. Who knew an energy/meal bar could be this good? Simply amazing!<br /><br />My favorite is the PECAN PIE FLAVOR. It satisfies my craving for an actual pecan pie, and it only has 3 ingredients! The ingredients are: dates, pecans, almonds. That's it! I cannot figure out how they make it taste like pie with only these ingredients but they do. How wonderful to have an item with such a short healthy ingredient list.<br /><br />My second favorite so far is the Lemon Bar, it's really good too, and has only 5 ingredients. Key Lime Pie is good... heck, they're all good!<br /><br />So refreshing to eat something that tastes so decadent, and is made from whole foods, thanks Lara Bar! :-)

review/summary: Not as tasty as other Larabars
review/text: I had tried the cashew nut Larabar and loved it. Then tried some of the fruit ones. Some were great. I didn't love the cherry as much. I tried this one because I love ginger.  I don't love the flavor of this bar as much as other Larabars.  With all the bars Larabar offers, I probably won't buy ginger snap again. I will definitely stick with Larabar, though. Tasty without the sugars.

review/summary: Larabar Key Lime Pie
review/text: Yum!  This was my first experience with a Larabar and I really liked it.  I love key lime pie to begin with, so I was beyond excited to find a bar in that flavor.<br /><br />While it didn't taste exactly like a Key Lime Pie, this bar did have a lot of lime flavor.  It also had some crunchy nuts that contrasted nicely with the almost fruit chews texture of the rest of the bar.  I also was able to taste the hint of coconut in there as well.  Between those three flavors, it tasted very fresh and almost like I was eating a fruit salad in bar form.  Definitely a pleasant experience.<br /><br />The ingredient list on this bar is phenomenal.  Only 5 ingredients are in it:  dates, cashews, almonds, coconut, and lime juice.  That's it, no hard to pronounce ingredients, no added sweeteners, just plain food that is easily recognized by just about anyone.  In fact, according to the package, because of those ingredients, this bar equals 1/4 of a cup of fruit.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, this bar is about on par with most other fitness bars.  It has 220 calories, which is high for a snack but good for if you're working out or as a meal replacement.  Sugars are high, 24 grams, but at least it's from all natural foods and not because they dumped a pile of sugar in the bar.  There's also some vitamins hiding in there, but those too aren't from vitamins injected into the food.<br /><br />A pretty good bar.  I'm eager to try out the other Larabars and see if they're just as good.  And I know I'll definitely be buying this one again.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Simply Delightful
review/text: I love a Larabar as a snack at work.  I don't get breaks or lunches, so I eat one mid-shift which holds me over well until I get home to eat a real meal.  They're convenient to throw in my purse, and are easy to eat.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Super healthy.  Three simple ingredients, no fillers, no added sugars.<br />- Good source of protein, plus a handful of vitamins and minerals.<br />- Very tasty.  Slightly sweet, and fresh peanut taste.<br />- Soft and chewy, easy to eat.  The peanuts are ground into small pieces, which I really like.  They're plentiful and blended perfectly with the dates.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Make me thirsty.  I recommend at least a little water after eating.<br />- A bit pricey.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I just love these Larabars.  They don't taste just like a peanut butter cookie, but they do have a wonderful flavor which I found surprising given the ingredients.  I love that there is no added sugars.  One bar makes me feel great after I eat it, and there is no sugar crash later on.  With protein and fiber, it's a great choice.  Also, it's gluten-free and dairy-free for individuals who cannot consume either of those two things.<br /><br />I highly recommend!

review/summary: Gingerbread without the guilt
review/text: At Christmastime, I made gingerbread men that I rolled out thick so they would retain their softness. They were good -- so good that I put on more pounds than I wanted because I enjoyed them so. But it's hard to find that spicy ginger taste that satisfies. Most gingerbreads and gingersnaps are lacking.<br /><br />In February, I started eating paleo. (Look it up - I won't explain it here.) For the occasional "cheat," I wanted something naturally sweetened without glutens or grains. Many paleo/primal websites recommend Larabars. I've eaten them before but never the Ginger Snap variety.<br /><br />O.M.G. They hit the spot and then some. What an indulgence -- and they remind me of my fattening gingerbread men from Christmas. Soft and chewy with that marvelous gingerbread taste. So worth it.<br /><br />So whether you're eating paleo, gluten free, natural whole foods or just want a good for you treat, Ginger Snap is it for ginger lovers.

review/summary: Cinnamon Roll
review/text: This Larabar tastes just like a cinnamon roll!!!  I don't know how those Larabar people do it, but whatever the flavor of Larabar it is, it tastes just like the real thing!!!  This particular Larabar is cinnamon roll, therefore, it goes good with a cup of coffee.  And in this cold weather lately, good hot coffee has been welcome!!!  I've been having my share lately of good hot coffee and Larabars!!!  And if you like cinnamon rolls, I'm sure you would love this particular Larabar.<br /><br />And for hot weather, or for the flavors of Larabars that go better with cold beverages, cold iced tea works very well also with Larabars.<br /><br />Oh, and I need to tell you, Larabars are natural - no added sugar, only natural sugar from fruits.  There are no bad ingredients.  There is also no soy.  Larabars are healthy, convenient, filling, perfect.  And vegan.  And even if you aren't vegan, you can still eat Larabars because they are so good.  They are so good, you forget that they are made from healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll Larabar.  Highly Recommended.

review/text: I'm always trying different "energy bar" type products. Lately I've been eating the Larabar during my long XC skiing tours. I've got to say that I think these are one of the best tasting bars I've eaten... ever. I love the tangy taste of the cherry and it is also good news to me that it is made with raw ingredients, no added sugar and no saturated fat (cholesterol free).<br /><br />The closest thing I could equate this bar to would be the inside of a fig newton cookie. It's firmer though and has more pronounced cherry flavor. I find it satisfying and I do "feel good" about eating it. I also like Cliff Bars but if I had only these two to choose from, I'd choose the Larabar Cherry Pie. Yum.

There are 220 calories in each bar, and 130 of them are fat calories, but this is FAR healthier for you than any candy bar.  Ingredients are dates, pecans, and almonds- amazingly simple!<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: These are, like all LaraBars, flavorful, filling, and made of simple ingredients.  The flavor wasn't all I'd hoped, given some of the reviews - they're cherry pie LaraBars with chopped peanuts added - a little peanut taste as you bite into them, and a peanut aftertaste.  What I loved about peanut butter sandwiches was the way the richness of the peanut butter contrasted with the fruitiness of the jelly.<br /><br />These bars don't do it for me, since they lack the rich peanut butter taste I love.  However, they're not at all bad in themselves (just not so good that they'd make my favorites list, where apple pie remains at the top, though I've never tried a LaraBar I really didn't like).

review/summary: As healthy as bars get
review/text: The raw nuts and fruits in these bars make them as close to nature as anything you will find in a wrapper. The Larabar reminds me of the naturally zesty and sweet fruit rolls I used to eat as a kid but also has wonderful, flavorfull fresh nuts mixed in. Raw nuts contain healthy fats and the protein and fat in the nuts will lower the glycemic index of the food. If you don't want to lug around raw cherries and a snack bag of raw nuts, this is the convenient alternative.<br /><br />Keep in mind, these are excellent treats for pets too. They are especially nice for birds who like to pick at the dried fruit and munch on the raw nuts. If you are going to offer these to a pet, please check the ingredients to be sure they are compatible with your species of pet.

review/text: I've tried many bars over the years, from snack bars to energy bars. These bars are the best tasting and are great in any flavor, but my favorite flavor is Peanut Butter Cookie as it's not too sweet. Being gluten sensitive and struggling with low blood sugar, Lara Bars are the perfect balanced snack for me when on the go whether I'm running errands or exercising. I ride a bicycle for many miles and carry a couple of Lara Bars, some fruit, and water. As a result, I feel sufficiently fueled for my rides and do not encounter any stomach distress.

review/summary: Yummy G/F Alternative!
review/text: First let me state that I've only tried 3 flavors so far (chocolate coconut, cocoa mole', and apple pie).<br /><br />I found chocolate coconut to be my least favorite. Normally I like the chocolate coconut combination, but in this brand it just didn't work for me!  If I had to rate it, I'd only give it 2 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that cocoa mole' was a huge improvement (so if you're in the mood for something chocolaty- I would highly recommend this)!!  The cinnamon/chili combo is very unique (but shouldn't be a surprise if you know what mole' is).  The cinnamon is comforting, and the chili gives it a little zing- with a faint hint of heat.<br /><br />  The apple pie flavor is so far my favorite out of the three.  You can definitely taste the distinct apple cinnamon flavor.  I'm not sure if I encountered a rasin in mine though.  I also like that it has walnuts in it.<br /><br />  Anyway, I can't wait to sample other flavors!  ..I hope they come up with a new flavor that involves macadamia nuts!!

review/text: The box shipped to me receives one star for old and stale inventory.<br />The product itself receives 5 stars.<br />Amazon receives 5 stars for refunding the full purchase amount.<br />Customer Service receives 5 starts for their professional conduct.<br /><br />For several years I have been purchasing my favorite LaraBar flavors at the nearest Trader Joe's location. I recently moved to an area where TJ has little presence, if any, and ordered the bars from Amazon instead. Although the label on the box had indicated the expiration date was 10 months away, the first bar I chewed into was dry, stale, with a bitter after taste. This is disappointing because I am familiar with this product and I know what flavor to expect. I still like LaraBar and will continue to consume it but my next purchase will have to be from a brick and mortar location where I can sample an individual bar prior to purchasing a full box.<br />Upon my request Amazon had issued a full refund for this purchase. Hail Amazon!!!!

review/text: I can't believe some people actually manage to compare these bars to Snickers or other fake-ingredient bars. Really? A 200 calories of fruit and nuts vs. hydrogenated, high-fructose, heart-attack calling candy bars should really make this decision easy.<br />I actually came across Larabars just recently. I heard about them, but I was just never too curious to actually read the ingredients and try one. To give a little background on my life-style, I do all of my own cooking to make sure I know exactly what goes into it. I stray away from all the processed foods and I don't eat grains and starches such as potatoes. I also don't eat refined sugars as it falls into a category of processed foods. With that said, I am a human being and I do get cravings for something dessert-like. I have very high standards for my dessert. It has to be all-natural, unprocessed, and preferably without added sweeteners. With all of those requirements one has to pretty much always prepare their desserts from scratch because there aren't whole lot of prepackaged foods out there that have that same philosophy about preparing it. Larabar is one of the very few out there who actually got it right.<br />I was a little skeptical about the taste of the bars when I bought a couple to sample, but they all exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be buying them in the future.<br />Now, I wouldn't overindulge in eating a few of those a day as they are still plenty sweet and carbolicious, but I usually have a few bites after lunch as a dessert treat. One bar lasts me 3-4 days and I will choose it over Snickers any time of the day.

review/summary: Wonderful fruit and nuts on the go
review/text: This bar is great for getting raw fruit and nuts into your family. Could the nuts be chopped a bit smaller? Sure. But then the whole bar would be too mushy. Could they use fewer dates (to cut the sugar) and make the bar as moist? Doubtful. Cheries are tough as dried fruit goes, and I'm guessing that's the reason for the excessive dates. (Note, though, I can't stand plain dates and I don't notice the flavor or find them overwhelming. I'd just like a more tart, less sweet bar.)<br />This is the alternative to giving yourself and your family dried fruit--this bar is softer, easier to share, and slightly more flavorful than the best dried fruit. It makes nuts palatable to kids who think they don't like nuts. And that means more protein into your diet (though not as much as I'd like, it has exponentially more than plain fruit).<br />Great bar. Good price through Amazon. Stash these bars in your car, your briefcase, your desk drawer, your diaper bag, your kids' backpacks, and your family's workout bags.

review/text: I started picking up these bars at the health food store after I had to give up granola bars.  The cherry pie bars taste amazingly like the real filling, except without all the unnecessary sugar.  The bars are sweet enough on their own and the nuts add a delightful crunch.  The other flavors are delicious as well.  The price of the individual bars can fluctuate by more than sixty cents depending on the vendor and Amazon sells them for less as a large package than the individuals would cost at the cheapest store.  The organic ingredients and lack of additives ensure that the bars are gluten-free, but are still tasty.

review/text: The creators of this flavor (in the excellent larabar line of energy bars) got the lemon flavor perfect;but why did they leave out the potassium common in most other selections?The potassium is what makes the good "well being" feeling after you have digested this wonderful fiber heavy food and without that you get a curious hollow feeling when you are supposed to be humming.That is Humm Foods goal, after all.I wonder what lara was thinking about with this one flavor?I would suggest a re-working of the lemon selection to incorporate more minerals.( especially the potassium).Otherwise, these are great bars; the cherry pie and cinnemon roll are the best ,followed by banana cookie,pecan pie,and apple pie of the flavors I have tried.But as everyone knows, most no other opinion is more subjective than taste.

review/text: Got these for my Mother-in-Law, due to the gluten free diet she has to be on. Come to find out our 22 month old daughter loves them. She is a picky eater so when we found out she will eat the whole bar, we decided to buy her some of her own. I also have tried and enjoyed these bars.

review/summary: Great cookie substitute
review/text: I got these bars for a quick snack in between clients at work or  while our an about. I'm on a gluten free, dairy free diet, and am somewhat limited to snacks. This has been a great filling substitute. These ones taste just like a PB cookie without all the preservatives and other junk in it! The Peanutbutter and jelly ones taste just like the sandwich! so glad to have some mre options!

review/summary: Moldy!!!
review/text: I love Larabars, and have about 1 a day during the week - so much so, that I have been ordering them in bulk to save a few bucks.  I very much like the spiciness of the Ginger Snap flavor, and is probably my 4th favorite flavor (after the brownie, bluberry muffin and pecan pie).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the latest bars I received were moldy, and they don't expire for months.  This item is not eligible for return, which is unfortunate.  $25 into the compost....what a waste!

review/summary: This is what a really healthy snack bar is ....
review/text: I think that this series of Larabar is what a real healthy snack should contain. If you look at the ingredients on all of this series of Larabars, then you'll see that it has only 3-4 ingredients like the fruit itself, dates and some form of nuts. It doesn't have sugar, salt or other preservatives. Because of the dates, it has natural sweetness and because of the nuts, it has natural saltiness. The nuts also give this bar it's calories (an average bar is about 200 calories).  The taste is well ... not like eating a Nature Valley snack bar. The taste is more like eating mashed fruit and nuts mixed together with dates. If you don't like dates or have a thing against dates, I wouldn't buy any of this series of Larabars because 90% of them have dates as a main ingredients. I think they use it as a natural binder. Because of this, I find that a majority of their bars taste kind of the same ... heavily flavored with dates.<br /><br />But, if you're trying to snack healthily and want to avoid processed foods and those sugary / salty snacks in the "snack bar" aisle at the supermarket, this is the bar to go with. Plus, if you buy it in bulk from Amazon, it comes out to be less than $1.25 / bar whereas at the markets it can go as high as $2.00+ / bar.  You just need to go the market and try all the flavors first before you commit to 16 bars of the same flavor at Amazon. It would suck to order 16 bars of a flavor and find out that you can stand the taste of it after the fact.

review/summary: Most Delicous Larabar EVER EVER EVER!
review/text: First of all, if you haven't tried Larabars yet, you're missing out!  All of their flavors taste just like their names.  Before I tried the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, my favorite flavor Larabar was Key Lime Pie (it tastes just like real key lime pie but is so much better for you!)  What first impressed me about Larabar is that I can pronounce all of their ingredients.  What next impressed me was that my picky 3 year old would eat them! He's now 5 and these are still his favorite snack.  Perfect way to get him some healthy, natural calories when he won't eat anything else.  These are my favorite breakfast, and they're best refrigerated.  They're a staple in our house.  Highly recommend!

review/text: These satiate my need for either a quick breakfast or something to eat in the afternoon for a snack when I need something I can carry in my purse. I've tried the lemon and the apple pie. I've very please with them both, but I didn't have unrealistic expectations for them. We, socially, have his idea that for example if we're unwrapping the lemon bar it's going to be bright yellow, vibrant, and very lemony. Not the case. They come out brown and nutty with a light, fragrant lemon flavor. The apple pie is the same. Unwrapped it is a brownie sized cut of brown apple pulp with ample nuts mixed in; very simple, tasty, and meets my need for a quick boost of fruit that won't immediate spoil like buying the freshest of produce might.

review/summary: Healthy RAW Snack
review/text: Some people say these are a high fat , high calorie , high glycemic , glorified candybar. I say otherwise. Concerning fat, not all fats are equal , some being healthy . Since this bar is raw all of the fat,protein and sugar have not been denatured  which means you get the full health benefit. As far as being high calorie , considering how nutrient dense these babies are I don't consider 200 calories high in calories at all. For me 200 calories is a perfect number allowing it to be used an nutrient dense snack or a quick meal on the go.<br /><br />Concerning these supposedly being high glycemic , sure , if you were to eat the dates in these by themselves it would be , but the nuts in them bring the glycemic load of the entire bar way down , which is another benefit of the healthy fats in these bars , it allows for the sugars to be released slower and for it to digest slower making you feel full and satisfied longer.<br /><br />As far as these not being any better than a candybar I say noway! No preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup , etc, in these babies , just a healthy combo of fruit and nuts. How many nutrients does a candybar have ? Now look at the nutrient in these , loaded with minerals . Also, unlike many other foods these aren't naturally low in nutrients and then "fortified" with man made vitamins and minerals to make them then appear healthy. All the nutrients in these are naturally occuring which gives you the benefits in a synergistic way where other healthy compounds such as flavonoids and phenols work together with naturally occurring vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />People need to let go of the old dogma which makes them think all fat is bad but if it's sugar free then it MUST be good. If that were true then cotton candy , pepsi and skittles would all be great for ya !Fruit and nuts makes for a good healthy breakfast or snack. I'll eat my greens/green smoothies in the other meals of the day. A person shouldn't eat only fruit and nuts during the day but they shouldn't only eat greens either . These bars help make it easy to strike a balance in your diet on the go. Larabars, Pure bars , SmartMonkey bars and ThinkOrganic bars are all healthy brands of raw bars that amazon sells and all worth a try . Experiment and see what flavors you like best , or make your own !

review/summary: Some GREAT Some HORRIBLE overall i'm HOOKED!!!
review/text: Tropical Fruit Tart<br />5 Stars<br />This bar is very refreshing with a wonderful fruit and citrus flavor and soft chewy texture.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough<br />2 Stars<br />I'm not a fan of this flavor. The bar would be much better without the chocolate chips that somehow leave a funny aftertaste.<br /><br />Coconut Cream Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Oh my I do love coconut, and this bar was better then I expected it to be. Wonderful texture and not too chewy. This would be a great replacement for the raspberry coconut zingers I'm addicted to!<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll<br />3 Stars<br />This one didn't blow me away or disappoint so I am giving it an average review. The bar was a little harder then I would have preferred and the Cinnamon flavor could have been stronger. It should just be called Cinnamon as it does not have any flavors that could hint as being a healthy bar flavored like a cinnamon roll. If you like cinnamon you will probably like this bar but if you are indifferent to cinnamon I would skip this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie<br />3 Stars<br />This one's ok... Good texture, not nearly the amount of cashew flavor I expected for something called "Cashew Cookie", and it almost had a stale flavor even though it was eaten well before the best by date.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip<br />5 Stars<br />This bar definitely hit my sweet tooth. Great texture, no funny aftertaste like some of the other chocolate Larabar flavors and I would definitely put this on the list of candy bar replacements!<br /><br />Pecan Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Not overwhelmingly sweet, great pecan pie flavor, perfect soft, slightly chewy texture.<br /><br />Lemon Bar<br />5 Stars<br />Very nice Lemon flavor and a wonderful chewy texture that reminds you of an actual Lemon Bar! The Lemon lingers in your mouth quite a while.<br /><br />Banana Bread<br />1 Star<br />This bar was bitter. There's only 3 ingredients: Almonds, Dates, and Unsweetened bananas. Well bananas are naturally sweet so what was so bitter in this bar? Some people might not find this as bad as I did, but I couldn't get past the first bite.<br /><br />Apple Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Another favorite flavor. It tastes like apple pie with a few nuts. It's just perfect.<br /><br />Ginger Snap<br />5 Stars<br />Wonderful Ginger snap cookie taste! This is probably the sweetest one I've tried. Good texture, chewy and crunchy, and delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter & Jelly<br />3 Stars<br />This bar had a great texture but only a so-so flavor. I would not purchase a full box of these bars, but I would pick it over some of the others if I had a limited choice.<br /><br />Key Lime Pie<br />5 Stars<br />This was a nutty bar, which is to be expected, but the subtle hint of lime was delightful. I could stand to use even more lime flavor but the soft chewy texture and lime flavor make this one of my favorites.<br /><br />UPDATE w/Additional Flavors:<br /><br />Blueberry Muffin<br />5 Stars<br />Oh, I think I've found a new favorite! This bar has a wonderfully rich blueberry flavor without being too sweet and it reminds me of a Blueberry Oatmeal Muffin.<br /><br />Chocalate Coconut Chew<br />3 Stars<br />As a huge fan of the Coconut Cream I had high hopes for this bar but after eating it the only thing I could say was "Where's the coconut?!" I definitley missed the coconut texture and flavor. The chocolate flavor of this bar however was not too sweet, not overpowering, and overall the bar will suffice for a chocolate lovers craving.

Depending on which Larabar you choose, the Amazon per unit price ranges from 1.35 for the Cherry to 1.83 for the chocolate per unit.  Amazon needs to adjust its price in order to be competitive in the market.

review/summary: Banana bread brownie?
review/text: Wow, I just had my first Larabar today after a long run, and I have been blown away.  As of late my preference has been for protein bars, but I had picked up a Larabar a few months ago just because it looked interesting.<br /><br />I tried the "banana cookie dough" flavor, since I'm a banana nut.  Unwrapping the package was difficult, though I've since found out that they have a multi-layer wrapper because there are no preservatives.  Once open, I was confronted with a raw looking rectangle of brown with pale chunks in it.  It looked moist and smelled phenomenal.  The first bite made me think "banana bread", and as I ate the rest of the bar I decided it wasn't quite like banana bread, but closer to that than a "cookie", in any case.  The pale chunks were the #1 ingredient - almonds.  The #2 and #3 ingredients were dates and bananas, respectively.  The #4 ingredient was.... nothing.  There are only 3 ingredients.  I actually flipped the wrapper over to see the continuation of the ingredients list before I realized that there was no more list!<br /><br />These bars are a little expensive for a non-protein energy bar, but the taste is like nothing you would expect from a brown rectangular smashed together food thing.  Its simply incredible, and now I have to go back and purchase the other flavors to try them out, too.

review/text: I am a health and fitness nut and I've tried about everything out there.  I love these bars as they are really filling and taste great (unless you are a sugar addict and need everything to have that super sweet calorie filling flavor!)  I also appreciate that I can buy cases of just one flavor at Amazon.com because the store where I've been buying them has 3 flavors per box and I prefer chocolate the most.  Whoever wrote the poor review about the high fat doesn't understand much about diet!  I've lost 20 pounds using these bars as a morning snack between meals combined with regular exercise and watching portion sizes.  Fat isn't the monster some think it is.. you need it and these bars provide a natural fat full of Omega 3 and Omega 6 along with a good mix of carbs and protein.  Thank you Lara Bar.

review/summary: short on ingredients, long on utter deliciousness
review/text: These are my favorite variety of Larabar.  If you like gingerbread (not gingersnaps or gingerbread cookies, mind you -- actual gingerbread, the kind that you can eat by the slice) than I am willing to bet that you will love these bars as much as I do.  The taste is exactly like that of freshly baked gingerbread; the texture is moist like gingerbread but crunchy because of the nuts the bar contains.  The crunchiness, in my opinion, doesn't detract a whit from the overall fabulousness of these bars -- in fact, I would say it adds to it.<br /><br />Finally (and this is true of all Larabars) the stunning brevity of the ingredient list bears noting.  Larabars contain no added sugar, no artificial flavoring or coloring, and no preservatives.  All of the sweetness and flavor (and there is just enough of the former and plenty of the latter) come from wholly natural, healthful sources.

review/text: I can't have gluten or oates so this is a great snack to carry around if you're stuck on some kind of nutritional pariah boat.<br />It filling and a bit sweet (hello there, dates), but doesn't go overboard. If it went overboard you'd be leaving your nutritional pariah boat. That would be be unsafe.

review/summary: Cherry Pie Larabar
review/text: I love the Cherry Pie Lara bar.  Best and tasty bar for when my sugar is low.  I recomend this Bar for diabetics low sugar only, as the carbs are about 30 for the bar.

review/summary: Good Tasting Gluten Free Bar
review/text: These are a tasty little treat to have every once in awhile.  It is hard to find grab and go snacks when trying to eat gluten free and paleo.  These are little high on the sugar side (all from fruit, no added sugar) but these are great if you aren't all that concerned with that.

review/text: These little puppies are so good. My wife and I eat a strict diet and most of our diet consists of raw foods. These larabar a taste good and they are just dates and cashews!!! You can't find any other snack or meal bars out there without added preservatives or sugar!!!

review/summary: Super tasty, pronounceable ingredients
review/text: I was on the lookout for granola bars that have ingredients that are more natural. I used to love Nature Valley bars, then I fell in love with the FiberOne bars, then I inhaled Balance bars. Now I think I've settled on Larabars, simply because they have such few ingredients and I can pronounce every single one of them. Even better, I can go to a regular grocery store and buy the ingredients, and if I'd want to spend more time in the kitchen, I could make them myself! (google for recipes, people really do make them themselves!)<br /><br />Love that Amazon sells them in bulk (they can get quite pricey, depending on which grocery store you go to).<br /><br />My favorite flavers are the Coconut Creme Pie, the Keylime Pie, the Carrot Cake, and the Cherry Pie. Soooo good! I don't leave the house without one or two of these in my bag :)

review/summary: Delicious and Healthy
review/text: I buy these for the whole family.  Coconut Cream Pie is our favorite flavor.  (We also like the chocolate varieties and Key Lime Pie.)  My 5yo and 2yo sons think these are a real treat since they are so sweet.  I love the simple, natural ingredients too.  They are a little pricey, but healthier foods usually are.
