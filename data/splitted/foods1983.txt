review/text: This biscuit mix is divine. I made two packages of biscuits for a Holiday luncheon. They were a big hit with the attendees. Several people asked for the recipe. I had to come clean and tell them about the mix. :+( The biscuits are very delicate and flavorful.

review/summary: not what I'd hoped
review/text: It's not that glittery, and it becomes gummy upon contact with moisture... I think this stuff only works if you sprinkle it on and then immediately serve the dish. I used it as a decoration on top of a cheesecake, and within 30 minutes it had "melted" into a gooey substance - and the cheesecake had just come out of the refrigerator. Cute idea, poor execution.

review/summary: Very tasty and smokey!
review/text: I'd never heard of this type of base before my husband was in culinary school. They used a different<br />brand, and a beef base had given a certain dish a flavor I'd had in restaurants that was missing in home cooking.<br /><br />One thing to note - while these bases all say "no added MSG" it does NOT mean they are MSG-free!<br />It means they didn't ADD any straight MSG.  They still have hydrolyzed items in them, which are a form of MSG.<br />If you are sensitive to it or allergic to MSG, then heads-up, you might be careful about base products.<br /><br />That being said...<br /><br />I'd never personally used it before, so was not really familiar with it. I had a great soup recipe that I wanted<br />to try, but it called for vegetable stock. There was not a drop of stock in the house of ANY kind, so I thought<br />about my new ham base. I stirred several spoonfuls up in a separate bowl with very hot water, but I probably didn't<br />have to do it that way. I then added it to my soup, which had lentils, sweet potatoes, apples, regular potatoes, onions<br />and carrots. I figured ham would work with any of those items individually, so should be okay together.<br />Wow!  The soup was SO GOOD! The ham base gave it a nice, smokey flavor. You'd have thought I put a ham bone with meat<br />in there with the other ingredients!<br /><br />The base does have to be refrigerated once it is opened. I put the date on ours with a sharpie, but of course,<br />that isn't super necessary.<br /><br />All in all, this was very tasty. I'll be trying it with soup beans and cornbread next.<br />As long as you watch out for the salt/MSG content, you'll be okay. If you are not sensitive to such things,<br />then it'll be okay.  I can tell you that both my husband and I have problems with MSG, but did not seem to have<br />any effects from this base.

review/summary: Excellent for diets!
review/text: Ham Base is one of the best products for a low-fat, low-calorie or even low-carbohydrate (high-protein) diet. A few teaspoons of this product dumped into the water in which you're cooking any beans, cabbage, brussel sprouts and the like makes the veggies taste like they've been cooked with ham hocks. No fat. Low calorie. Do keep track of the number of servings they claim are in one jar and multiply that by the per-serving calorie-count; the jar has a few more calories than you might think. But you can use the Ham-Base-treated water more than once, and not all the Ham Base gets into your veggies.<br /><br />This is a miraculous product for dieters who don't like plain veggies. Why in the world do grocery stores serve all the less desirable "Better than Bouillon" products and not this one?

review/text: I was yearning for collards/turnip greens and couldn't justify buying a hunk of ham for just 2 people. So, I thought I'd try this.........it's just wonderful! Smokey and not terribly salty.....great meaty flavor ( although  it's mostly vegetable). My family are MSG sensitive, so I'm careful, but this has none added. And BOY! Did it make a difference! Can't wait to make split pea soup, and purple hull peas, and.....<br />We stirred some into canned brown beans and they were SO much better! It doesn't take much, either........ great stuff. Well worth the $12.00.

review/summary: Million dollar taste for pennies
review/text: This is the secret ingredient to make a man pleasing bean soup!  A leftover ham bone didn't give me the "hammy" taste I needed, and my Senate Bean Soup recipe would not have been re-elected had it been running for office this year.  (I'd cooked all the "life" out of my ham bone.)  Headed off to my local Safeway store, and there it was.  Ham Base.  I'm an experienced cook, and started out with a half teaspoon of base in a bit of very hot water.  Yum.  So I added another half teaspoon.  Better.  Added it to my already completed Senate Bean Soup and simmered for another half hour.<br /><br />As with all these wonderful Better Than bases, use the directions to suit your own taste.  I do use a bit of salt in my cooking, and sea salt as a finishing flavoring.  A little less salt, a little less base.<br /><br />Bottom line:  This Ham Base with just a few little chunks of leftover ham, will make any soup, even canned, have that taste of a great little bistro.

review/summary: Yummy in Navy Bean soup....
review/text: I made a great Navy Bean soup with ham shanks (instead of less meaty hocks) using this. The recipe used 8 cups water, and I dissolved some of this ham bouillon into it with a little boiling water first. Really added a lot of rich ham flavor to the soup.<br /><br />That said, I was too liberal re: the 1 t. per cup instruction and it turned out a bit too salty. Next time I will use 6 level t. per 8 cups water in the soup and add NO salt, which should be just perfect. (The jar I got from Safeway was not of the more current 'low sodium' variety they make in chicken and beef.)

review/summary: Delicious Fermented Black Beans
review/text: Very authentic. Tasted just like the beans they put in my favourite chinese takeaway. Keep them in a glass jar with a tight fitting lid to make them last properly. To use the black beans just take out what you need and put in a sieve and hold under cold running water to get rid of the excess salt, then put the beans in a bowl of cold water for 30mins to soften. I like to use these beans with chinese flat wide rice noodles. If you go onto Google Images and type in whatever chinese recipe you want a load should come up. Just click on the one you want then press the x button on right hand corner of the picture. If anyone is after chinese flat wide rice noodles, then a good place to go is quite near Walthamstow Central Station, E17. As you enter Walthamstow market you'll see a 99p shop on the right. You will need to stay on the left hand side, walk for 3-4 minutes and you'll come across a chinese shop (not particularly big but they do have a lot of stuff) and they sell the noodles fresh and dried, as well as an abundance of other chinese goodies for your recipes as well as a selection of frozen dim sum, mmmmm........ Apparently you can freeze the fresh noodles, then defrost when ready to use. If you can't separate them properly then pour boiling water over them for 2mins. The dried noodles (cheaper) you'll need to pour boiling water over them for 6-8mins

review/text: I gave this as a gift to my brother.  Everyone really enjoyed them.  My brother's pre-schooler shouted, "Yeah! Cigarettes!" :)  To add to the debate, I don't believe these candies create smokers.  Me and my brother ate these growing up and neither of us smoke.  Even as teenagers, we would get candy cigarettes instead of smoking real ones.  If anything, it was an alternative to smoking for us.

review/summary: ZERO STARS IS NOT A CHOICE Do not buy the candy cigarettes
review/text: Im 30 yrs old. I have bought candy cigarettes my entire life. I actually bought 14 packs a few days ago from the ice cream man. Tasted wonderful, the same as always. THE ONES I ORDERED ON AMAZON WERE NOT THE SAME. ABSOLUTELY NOT THE SAME!!!!!!!!!!!!! Different taste/flavor, different texture, different moisture content... YET... the boxes are printed the same. The ingredients are listed the same. The manufacturer is the same. How then is it possible that the ones I bought 3 days ago so good and the Amazon ones to disgusting?!?!?! I do not know. All I know is, I WISH I HAD SEEN THESE REVIEWS BEFORE I BOUGHT 38 DOLLARS WORTH, 1200CANDY CIGARETTES FROM AMAZON. Of coarse to get a refund I must pay shipping. Total shipping... 24 dollars. Total refund... 28 dollars. I only receive 4 dollars of my money back and lose the product. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE TASTE BUDS AND A MEMORY IN YOUR BRAIN OF THE REAL FLAVOR. I am very disappointed and will NEVER buy from Amazon ever again. I had a gift card, only reason I did this. A gift from the parents of a 15 year old disabled child I work with on a volunteer basis. Thank you amazon. THANKS FOR NOTHING. Plus they lied to me by saying no one has ever complained about this... I saw at least 3 or 4 on this page alone. DO NOT TRUST AMAZON. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING WITHOUT REVIEWING IT FIRST. IF THERE IS EVEN ONE BAD REVIEW TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. I bet the good one are fake and used to support false claims as I personally know their claims are 100% false. I will be posting this on message boards and facebook all over to inform everyone I know.

review/summary: they don't look like cigarettes
review/text: I'm having a 1920's theme party and since none of the ladies attending smoke anymore, I thought I'd get candy cigarettes instead of real ones to put in the end of the cigarette holders.  This item was a GREAT deal and comes with a lot of packs- the packaging is fun, but the "cigarettes" don't in the slightest bit resemble a real cigarette.  Good if you are purchasing them for kids, but defeats my purpose.  They are about the thickness of a lollipop stick, which makes them impossible to stay in the cigarette holders.

I recall puffing on the candy cigarettes and thinking it made me cool like a grown up, like my parents...  Then I recall how "cool" it was to smoke as a teenager in high school.  Took me 14 years to quit!  I have watched two people die from smoking... One went through being horribly cut open to remove a cancerous upper part of one of her lungs, only to go back to smoking a year later.  Another had emphazema (spelling?) from it and die a long painful suffocating death.  There's nothing "cool" about candy cigarettes or anything that would make light of such a horrible addiction!

review/summary: Try again Pacific Foods!
review/text: First, I typically love products produced by Pacific Natural Foods. This was not a winner in my book. The smell was the first thing that turned me off. I had to wait five minutes to even try the soup because it smelled so awful. When I tasted it, the spices used were overpowering and it was difficult to taste any sweet potato. What I could taste reminded me of curry and it seems like the soup could be married well with rice. Unfortunately as the soup is now, it would be too runny to pour over rice. I suppose a person could add some sweet potato and regular potatoes to make it thicker. I drowned the soup with saltines and it was edible but not enjoyable. I'm giving it two stars because I think with modifications it could be used for different non-soup purposes. Better luck next time Pacific.

review/text: I will never buy this product again.<br /><br />I really don't think these folks tasted their own product before it went out the door because they clearly don't know what chipotle is suppose to taste like. I'm from Texas and you can go into any Walmart and pick up and smell a bag of smoked jalapeno's to know the difference and it's nothing close to Ranch Style Beans. Apparently Pacific Foods must not visit Walmart.<br /><br />And oh, you can forget tasting anything that's even remotely close to sweet potato. No sweet. No potato.<br /><br />And the entire box contains 60% RDA DV in sodium. What they consider a single serving (which there are two in the entire box) wouldn't make a 10� turd.<br /><br />And something else just came to mind. Try opening the box. I dare you! Lift the corners up, squeeze the upper sides flat, grab one end and try to tear across two tightly glued poly-coated double ply chipboard. You'll either have a hernia or orange colored soup all over you and the kitchen. I had to resort to scissors.<br /><br />Just another "Made Ya' Look!" over hyped yuppie marketed product.

review/summary: So good, even the cats eat it!
review/text: I have a dog with with terrible allergies to most commercial dog foods. Tried them all, from the cheap stuff to Iams, Science Diet, Eukanuba, etc. Even had him on a raw diet, which was great for his allergies - no more hives or itchies - but a raw diet isn't practical and I'm still on the fence about whether that gives him the nutrients he needs. I switched to grain free dog food and tried a few different brands. He seemed to enjoy most of them, but the Wilderness brand even had my cats trying to sneak food out of the dog's bowl. So I switched them to Wilderness for cats. What a difference it's made. Soft, shiny coats, great skin, no more stinky, runny poops in the litter boxes. Oh, and my dog has now been hive/itch free for six months. Amazon's prices are very competitive, and free shipping means I don't have to make a trip to the pet store and haul it home.

Folks, just check the ingredients in the average dog food, and then compare it to BLUE BUFFALO WILDERNESS. My dog has been on this brand of food for 3 weeks now and this is what has happened: His paw licking due to allergies has basically ended. His eye allergies have ended. And the biggest thing, his ear itching and "funkyness" is all but gone. I can not say enough about this type of food. I'm just sorry it took me 7 years to figure it out. I will never feed my dogs anything but "Grain Free Dog Food" from now on. This is NO GIMMICK which is hard to find in anything nowadays! I hope this reaches many folks that can take advantage of this type of food. Your "Best Friends" will thank you forever.

This honey was so tasty I started going through it very quickly and have been using it to sweeten Greek yogurt parfaits I make at home.  Can't stress how much better tasting this is.  In between shipments of this honey I had to 'fill in' with regular Manuka honey and thought the yogurt had gone bad when I realized it wasn't the yogurt it was because regular Manuka honey has an 'earthy', 'eucalyptus' flavor this one does not.

review/summary: Confessions Of A Die-Hard Coffee Drinker
review/text: Good Earth Green Tea - Lemongrass<br /><br />No way, no how, was I ever going to be a tea drinker. Coffee was my perker-upper of choice, and loved every jittery cup of it. I still like my morning cup and the aroma of good coffee brewing in the morning. Whenever offered tea by friends I'd always decline - "coffee if you've got it please". I would settle for the last of a pot that had been heating for hours rather then try tea. So to say I am no expert on tea is ...well... the truth. My experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant, or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. So when I say I Love This Tea - you can be sure that's the truth as well.<br /><br />It started with a coupon. It was a bargain to pick some up at my local market, and thought well, maybe I should have some on hand for all those tea lovers I know. Hearing so much about the benefits of green tea, I picked out a box of it and put it up on a shelf. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green, various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on this Good Earth Lemongrass. This one I loved.It was the best I tried. So naturally my next stop was here at Amazon. And naturally I found this great deal.<br /><br />The taste is wonderful and so is the aroma. Light and citrusy, but slightly sweet - not what I thought "lemongrass" would be.I didn't need to add anything at all. It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffe per serving. It gives me a renewed and refreshed energy in the afternoons without any jitteryness.It also doesn't seem to be  dehydrating -as coffee can be.Not to mention the other health benefits. According to the box, this blend is rich in antioxidants. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br /><br />Ingredients: Green Tea,Lemongrass,Natural Flavors,Rose petals and Peppermint.<br /><br />As I said, Amazon has the best deal. I bought the six pack of 25 bag boxes-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM68QG">Good Earth Tea Green Tea, Lemongrass, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. One box comes out to be less then the 20 bag box sold at my market.<br /><br />Oh and on the tag of each bag(which are slit to sit on the edge of the cup) are some delightful and inspiring quotations or proverbs that may start you out with a smile. Here are a couple of them I'll leave this review with:<br /><br />"You will never be alone with a poet in your pocket"...John Adams<br /><br />"Flowers leave some of their fragrance in the hand that bestows them"...Chinese Proverb<br /><br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy....Laurie

review/summary: Great Light Tea
review/text: It's a great after dinner tea: refreshing and light. I enjoy the taste for what it is (light, night-time, non-herbal tea with lemongrass-ish flavor), as it tastes nothing like green tea. The 6-pack from Amazon is a good deal as one box at my local store costs $3.79 (give or take a few pennies.)

review/summary: The BEST
review/text: This tea is awesome. I've been drinking it for about 15 years and never get tired of it. Hot, cold, no matter. It's fruity and without the tannins or extreme earthiness found in many other teas. A slight citrus nose to it. Hey, and with the antioxidants, this is a real winner.

review/text: I bought this because of the other reviews on Amazon and have been very pleased.  Most green teas taste like grass to me.  This does not. It has a tiny bit of lemon to it, which is very refreshing. I bought an electric ice tea maker and between the two of them, I have been very pleased.

review/text: I can't really say anything bad about this tea. Its quite good, but didn't line up with my expectations. I expected this tea to be a bit more full-bodied, but instead, it is a very light, airy flavor that goes well with a good dose of honey. If you're looking for a more flavorful experience, try the Sweet & Spicy variety, but if you're looking for a light, relaxing tea, this one will do just fine.

review/text: It's almost embarrasing to admit that I like flavored and smoother green tea better these days since I am originally from a country with long history of tea-growing and tea-drinking where people drink tea as it is for thousands of years. I like Good Earth Super Green Tea a lot and bought this lemongrass flavored green tea by mistake but I am glad I did.

review/text: This is awesome tea. I do not usually like any hint of lemon in my tea, however, this tea has changed my mind! For me, plain green tea is hard to drink. It taste's like mowed grass! So I choose green teas with other flavors added. This is one of the best IMO. I have not tried it iced yet, but think it would be equally as wonderful served that way. The tea stands on it's own& does not really need a sweetener, but a drizzle of honey really brings out the flavor!

review/summary: I liked the old man design better :)
review/text: I don't normally add content to Amazon because the site is so huge, but I must say that this green tea is some of the best bagged green tea you can buy in my opinion, besides having good Sencha from Trader Joe's. Although it does not taste overtly like sencha or a nicer green tea, it definitely still carries the flavor but is accented by the lemon grass and citrus nutes they added. I always add wild flower honey or orange blossom honey, more of the wild fruity honey's taste better with this tea. Sugar tends to ruin the taste of it, so I prefer one teaspoon of honey and it is wonderful. If you like this, I would check out the ancient recipe for Hop Gar Shaolin Tibetan medicinal tea recipe Teh-Dah tea.

review/summary: Not my cup of tea
review/text: I bought this because it was on sale and it has perfect review. To be honest, it's not my cup of tea. The lemongrass taste is too strong and you can barely taste the green tea. But taste is a subjective thing. I recommend people get one from their local supermarket and try it before buying six boxes from amazon. Besides the taste, the "Natural Flavors" ingredient also concerns me. Basically, you don't know what you are drinking. Just because it says natural, it doesn't mean it's harmless. One last thing, to those who drink green tea for antioxidants, this tea is mix with a lot of other herbs. You are not getting as much antioxidants per tea bag as the other brands.

review/text: If you're watching your carbs and miss egg noodles, Carba Nada is a good replacement. It isn't greatly low carb, but quite a bit less than regular pasta, so you need to watch serving sizes, but it cooks in only 5 minutes and accepts tomato and other sauces very well. The different flavours add more variety, and its also easy to toss with some butter, parmesan, and seasonings. Add leftover chicken or beef, and some vegetables, and you have a quick easy meal for less carbs.
