review/text: As a professional dog trainer who works 12 - 14 hour days, 7 days a week.......I am a coffee drinker! My clients purchased a sign which says "Dog Trainer Powered by Coffee". At home I use an antique vacuum pot to brew my freshly ground beans. At work I use a Keurig machine so that the coffee doesn't sit on a burner while I give classes. I enjoy a good tasting and strong cup of coffee. I have tried MANY k-cups. None have the flavor and aroma of this wonderful coffee, Lake and Lodge. I have finally found my "go-to" k-cup!

review/text: This is good cat food. To the reviewer who complained that their cats didn't lose weight with this food and are still vomiting - don't give the food itself a poor rating. Find out what your cat is allergic to and don't feed it as much! If you are free-feeding, your cat will gain weight because it can eat whenever it wants. Also, as cats age, they gain weight easier just like people do. It's not the food's fault.

review/text: Unlike the common variety of salsa's, Arriba's Fire roasted taste is rich and full bodied flavor. This is better than any restaurant salsa I have ever had (Born and raised in Texas). As with all finer foods, if you are trying to make a large dish, you can stick with the common variety jar of tomatoes in water, if however you wish to garnish with exceptional flavor, or use as a dipping salsa, Arriba is a must have. Being a active duty military, I have had this salsa shipped to me in the Middles East, and Europe, it is truley worth the effort with every bite.

review/summary: Arriba Red Salsa Medium
review/text: I bought a jar of this salsa last week because I heard a lot of raves about it. I really like this salsas taste and had it with chips and later with tortillas with cheese. I don't like extremely hot salsa and this one is pretty mild for being medium. I am wondering if anyone has tried the hot version and how they like it. I would give this salsa a 5 if it were a tad hotter. I found it at the local store for around $4.50 a jar. You can't go wrong with this Roasted Red Salsa. Check it out the next time you buy salsa.

review/text: Arriba Fire Roasted Mexican Salsa is outstanding.  It has a peppery, smoky, roasted tomato flavor and is excellent for dipping chips, cooking, or as a toping.  It does not have a lot of chucky tomatoes or peppers in it, which I prefer, but has a nice, even consistency.  It is an excellent salsa - in fact it's one of the best I've tried.  I prefer the hot variety, as I love spiciness, but they are all good.

review/summary: great chews
review/text: Since all the of the problems with pet foods and treats coming from China being tainted with various nasty things I have been on the hunt for pet treats made (and sourced) in the US, and Dogswell brand is one of the ones I've found. I didn't really notice that they were marked "happy hips", but really unless you have a toy sized breed the amount of glu/chon is too low to make much difference (the reason for only 4 stars). my dogs were a bit confused at first because they are quite chewy, but they do seem to really enjoy them, and I like giving them to my boxer when I crate her; it takes her a few minutes to completely consume it, and it seems to keep her occupied for the 10 or 15 minutes I leave her in there. I am lucky that my local pet shop has the entire line of Dogswell products, and I very much look forward to trying more of their products :)

review/summary: Smaller size but still a good price
review/text: Capers in brine cannot compare.  Brine turns the buds to mush.  These are crisp high quality capers in salt at a good price from Agostino Recca. You can find them in twenty-four oz elsewhere on Amazon. So I could have given that one five stars on best buy basis.<br /><br />I gave it four stars considering only a few in brine get three stars. Most get one star as weak and adulterated by things other than salt in the brine. So most pure salt brine still get only two stars. Not worth the low quality since these are available.<br /><br />This is my everyday old reliable. Do not cook them. Rinse out the salt if you do not need it, and use them after cooking is over, even in a caper sauce. They need only warm to blossom. They respond well to mortar and pestle.<br /><br />I saved five stars for the ones from Pantalleria which go with caviar, or best quality tuna or veal.

Lee Greene is incredibly meticulousness about where she sources her products from and the Dietzler beef used is impeccable in how the cattle are raised and fed. For me the sauce reminds me of childhood because she uses some cloves in the sauce that reminds me of a sauce I ate as a child. But for anyone who wants a tasty, locally sourced meal but doesn't have the time to cook, this is the sauce for you. My only problem is that it does not stay on my shelf for very long!

review/summary: back to Nature 100% Natural 9 oz. cookies
review/text: I saw these cookies at my whole food market several years ago and I purchased several varieties:  peanut butter, choc. chip, oreo, ginger, lemon, vanilla, etc.<br /><br />These are very pricey cookies that cost $3.99 per box, but they are worth the money.  Sometimes you can get them on sale at 2/$5.<br /><br />They are delicious and I am officially addicted to them.  However, not all the flavors are my preference.  I prefer the ginger, peanut butter, & vanilla.  You might prefer another flavor.<br /><br />The cookies have no artificial preservatives, colors, and no high fructose corn syrup.  They are made of whole grain wheat flour, and other natural flavors.<br /><br />The box contains approximately 45 cookies at 9 oz.  They are typically 170 calories and 10 g of sugar depending on the variety.  The product contains unprocessed cane sugar.<br /><br />Five cookies equal one serving size, and the product typically has 3 g of fat with about 21 g of carbs  The product contains dietary fiber ~3 g and 0 g trans fat.<br /><br />I like their slogan...simple ingredients, simply delicious, simply good.  Since the cookies use wholesome ingredients and techniques, they have robust flavors much like days gone bye.<br /><br />So many people, including myself, have gotten so accustomed to artificial flavors and the like that real flavors can be alarming at first, but this is what whole foods hopes to accomplish--getting back to the real thing.<br /><br />This product is made in Canada.

review/text: We normally buy Back to Nature Chocolate Chip Cookies and decided to try the other varieties for our boys' lunches. We've tried the Madagascar Vanilla, California Lemon, and now the Peanut Butter Creme. While the Vanilla and Lemon cookies are very, very crunchy and have a strong, wheat-y aftertaste, the Peanut Butter Creme cookies are just as good as the Chocolate Chip. These cookies taste like a healthier (note that I didn't say "healthy") version of Nutter Butters! The filling is not as sweet as other peanut butter sandwich cookies, but it is definitely rich. I don't mind my kids having a processed treat once in a while, and when they do I like to make sure that the ingredients are acceptable. Back to Nature is a nice alternative to other processed cookies with chemical additives and coloring.

The madagascar vanilla have a buttery taste and are very crisp.  I've liked all but the graham sticks so far.

I like the honey graham flavor. There are 120 calories and 2.5 grams of fat in one bag. None of this two servings in one bag. I often find that many "individual" bags contain more than one serving and are too much for one child. I don't want my child eating two or three servings of cookies! And trust me mine would if allowed. So they are perfect for school lunches or as a snack or treat during the day. I will be buying these again. And how can you beat 15% off with subscribe and save delivered to your door!  It amazes me how much I buy on the internet now. Practically everything and I love it!

review/text: After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to order this for my son's lunch brown bag. I found it taste a little stale, just not the fresh taste like you know when you are eating a good chocolate chip cookie and you are so "happy". OK, that was not one of that moments in my life. I tried really hard to enjoy them because I paid for a higher price for this, but every time I ate this, I just like - wish I didn't order this. I was hoping my hubby would like them since he has a sweet tooth and he'll have to finish those for me. He didn't like it either. Now my son (2 and half yr old) - the only person I bought this cookie for, who also likes sweets like his father, sorry to report - he does not like it either. He took a bite and dumped the whole bag and said he doesn't want them any more. What a bummer!

review/summary: No HFCS, soy, or processed sugar!
review/text: My DD is allergic to a long list of foods, including high fructose corn syrup, processed sugars, and soy.  Try finding a tasty snack that doesn't have at least one of those ingredients in it!  These taste great and both of my older kids love them.  (Baby hasn't tried them yet ;) ).  I'm happy to be able to give them a healthy alternative to a childhood favorite, and the individual packaging makes them easy to throw in the lunchbox for a school snack.  Convenient, delicious, and no allergies = a big hit in my house!  Subscribe and Save makes them even cheaper!!  Love it!

review/summary: Girl Scout What?
review/text: Forget about waiting for that certain time of year to be able to purchase Girl Scout cookies!! These are just as good and without some of those unnecessary additives that aren't good for our bodies, I honestly probably couldn't tell the difference on taste. Also, these are a better price!! I'm sold on Back To Nature products!!! You won't be disappointed in these. I love the Chocolate Delight Granola and the Chocolate Mint Sandwich Cookies as well (an exact flavor match to GS Thin Mints).

review/summary: Yummy Little Chocolate Chip Cookies
review/text: I purchased these for my children, to pack a sweet yet relatively healthful snack in their lunch sacks.  I am giving 5 stars by the recommendation of myself & three sons (age 7, 5 & 3).  When I tasted these, my first thought was that they were going to be gone FAST.  My children and I love these little cookies ... Crunchy little gems without all the trans-fats & preservatives, that I try to keep out of my children's diets as much as I can.  These will definitely remain on my grocery list.

review/text: These tasted just like the little Famous Amos cookies, and I was glad to see they were made out of actual food & not a bunch of chemicals (not that the Famous Amos cookies are necessarily fake food--I don't know offhand). I do like that the portion size was small, though the packaging is a little excessive for what you're getting--but individual portions always are. But you can always recycle the Mylar bags & feel less guilty about using excess packaging to curb your gluttony.

review/summary: Unbelievably good!
review/text: I usually don't write food reviews because, well, 'one man's meat is another man's poison', as the saying goes. We actually stumbled upon these cookies. On a whim, I picked up a package marked for clearance at Target and, since then, my daughter and I have been fighting over it. Unfortunately, I can no longer find them at Target so I guess we will now have to buy in packs of 6 through Amazon. Never mind, I suppose I can store them in the cool basement.<br /><br />We try to not eat too many in a day as 2 cookies will cost you 130 calories (so this pretty much means eating only 2 cookies per day!). I am very sensitive to food additives and can always detect the chemicals in some 'natural' foods (e.g. Kashi). One bite and I could tell that there are none in these cookies. Also important was that it is just gently sweet; most off-the-shelf cookies are much too sweet for me. Think I'm also going to try Back to Nature's Graham Cookies through Amazon since it's got some rave reviews! I'm definitely sold on this brand.

review/summary: Healthier Cookie With A Decadent Taste!
review/text: Fresh... six boxes... with a sell by date at least 4 months away. The sell by date is important in a product that says it's all natural!<br />The boxes say 100% Natural and are packaged in at least 55% recycled packaging.<br /><br />No artificial preservatives, flavors or colors. No high fructose syrup. No hydrogenated oils.<br /><br />The cookies are delicious!<br />A nice crunchy cookie with a semi-sweetish tasting peanut butter filling. The cookies taste like wheat more than the white bread side of things. Two cookies is supposed to be a serving size... I'm sorry to say... the first two times I had them... I couldn't stop at two!<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthier peanut butter cookie... with a decadent taste... look no further... you've found it!<br />I highly recommend these cookies.<br /><br />They're a bit pricey to be serving for children's snacks on a regular basis... but I would probably hide them in the top cabinet... lock it... lol... and bring them out in portion size servings for the children. :)

Perfectly baked, not too sweet, and seriously addictive! I had a box in the pantry, and my daughter, son-in-law, & husband finished them off in 2 days!<br /><br />Warning: this is not a health food. At 130 calories & 5g fat for 2 cookies, you won't want to sit with the unopened box because you WILL want more than just 2! So just take out 1 or 2 cookies, seal up the box, & savor the yumminess!

review/text: These cookies were delivered on time and the package was as described.<br />We usually buy these cookies from a discount warehouse store but they ran out.  The package from the discounter is slightly different from the Amazon.com supplier but the cookies are the same.  After totaling the price and shipping we found that it costs less to purchase from the warehouse store when they have them.  It is more expensive to buy these cookies on-line than to buy them in the store.  Nevertheless my son enjoys the cookies and we are satisfied.

I also have a teenage daughter who packs her lunch or dinner on long marching band days and I wanted a healthier alternative for her.<br /><br />These peanut butter cookies are GREAT!  They are very similar to the girl scout cookies that I grew up on (and continue to adore).  Wonderful flavor, all-natural ingredients, and very filling.  I can eat 2 or 3 of these as a dessert and feel like I got my "fix".<br /><br />Well worth the money ---

review/summary: Honey Graham Sticks
review/text: This review is for the Honey Graham sticks.  My son was diagnosed in 2010 with food allergies and I immediately set out to find foods he could enjoy.  It was not easy.  Some foods that don't use corn based sweeteners taste horrible- I am so happy to say that this is not one of those.  These crackers are SO good, we often run out before our next shipment comes.  There are usually 13 sticks in each pack (we've used them in math lessons quite a few times, my son gets quite a kick out of eating his work!), so not a lot, but a nice little snack for a child.  We love them with the JIF peanut butter cups to go or plain.  They are way better than Honeymaid or Keebler grahams!

I chose these because of their organic ingredients and the price. The cookies are not pretty, in fact the first co-worker to try them named them the "ugly cookies" but guess what she loves them. She hides them in her desk drawer. Everyone agrees they have good chocolate taste and despite their unattractive appearance of non uniformity and chunkiness they are tasty. Don't let the cover fool you.

My three year old granddaughter absolutely loves this yogurt, and every time I ask her which flavor of yogurt she wants, she always asks for this one. Unfortunately, I can no longer find this yogurt locally (and we are down to one cup left), and the price for it here on Amazon is ridiculously high! A total of eight cups for ten dollars + shipping is highway robbery when these cost $2.65 for a 4 pack when I could get them locally. The 5 stars is for the product alone, not for Amazon or the marketplace sellers who are trying to rob people on this product! They get 0 stars, in my opinion.

review/summary: Sour yogurt...
review/text: Whoever thought this was a good idea was an idiot.  I know that this is made for children, babies even, but we had some in the house and I was hungry and I love yogurt and I love bananas and so I was kind of anxious to try this.  The fact that these don't have to be refrigerated caused me to wonder about their flavor.  I assumed they would be more of a pudding, but what I go was some weird amalgam that made my stomach turn.  The flavor is a mixture of yogurt and banana pudding; two wonderful things that come together to make something almost rancid in flavor.  The banana flavor is cloying, but it is the underlying yogurt flavor that makes this disgusting.  It really does taste like sour dairy.  I threw the rest of it out (and we had a ton of this stuff).  My daughter wouldn't touch it.  She spit it out and I don't blame her.

review/summary: Wow, can't get by without it now
review/text: I bought this online from a gourmet vendor thinking it was regular sea salt and had intended to return it.  Now I can't get by without it.<br /><br />It is great with so many different things I cook.  I decided to try it a couple of months ago on a plain hard boiled egg instead of just a sprinkle of salt.  Now I have to have Sarah's Sea Salt on my eggs.  It is just so boring without it.  I will be buying it again and again and again.  I am almost afraid to try the other flavors for fear my whole cupboard will fill up with the jars.

review/summary: Don't eat them in front of the child.....
review/text: They are fun to do and pretty to look at. Just don't eat them while your child is standing there. These were some of the most sickly sweet but NASTY cookies I have ever tasted. I am ashamed to say I let my granddaughter take some of them home to her mother. I just hope they haven't tried to eat them before I can call them in the morning and give them a heads up. I just took a bite and couldn't even swallow it. I was SO glad she wasn't there to see my reaction.<br /><br />She had a blast making them and seeing the dough turn pink. The experience MAKING them was great. Eating them sent me running to my computer to review them.

review/summary: Waste of money - make your own cookies.
review/text: We got two of these for birthday and Christmas gifts, and both of the mixes tasted terrible. You could easily do this yourself with some store-bought refrigerated dough, a little red food coloring and your own powdered sugar frosting. I'm not sure why this was rated one of the "Top 10 gifts of 2011" (as stated on the package), these were the nastiest cookies I've ever tasted. The process was fun to do with my kids, but my husband and I had to sneak the rest of the cookies into the trash. Like I said, don't waste your money. Make your own!

review/text: I LOVE the Sassafras kits.  I have bought about 18 of them in the last few years for gifts.  There are many of them for boys and girls if you just search Sassafras they will pull up.  I always buy a book that coordinates with the kit that is a reader book since most of the gifts have gone to 5 and 6 year olds.  I have never had any shipping issues and they have always come bubble wrapped and in great shape.  These are really fun and cute.  I have 7 in a closet right now because with 3 kids there is always a birthday party to go to!

review/text: I was looking for a night time snack for myself that would satisfy my sugar cravings but not have a ton of calories.  Well this certainly fit the bill.<br /><br />These are so good and the small bags are just the right size.  Yes I could eat a whole box of these in one sitting but that kind of defeats the purpose.  But because these are low in calorie I don't feel guilty if I eat two packs.<br /><br />I didn't even look at expiration dates since I don't care and they're not going to last the month.<br /><br />I do wish they had this in all chocolate but the cinnamon is really good also.<br /><br />I'm really glad I got in on the subscribe and save before they closed it but the price went up.  I saw K-mart has these for $5.99/box which is better but it's worth it to have them delivered.  I don't know why the price hike.<br /><br />All I can say is Yum Yum!

review/text: Chocolate Teddy Grahams are so yummy!  As an adult, I love them.  I'd imagine kids would too.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- No high fructose corn syrup.<br />- Crunchy little bite-sized cookies.<br />- Nice chocolate taste that's not fake.<br />- Great to eat in the car, at your desk, or wherever.  It's a portable snack.<br />- Sweet but not sickeningly so.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- I really have no cons other than they will get stale if you don't wrap the bag up tightly.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I enjoy Chocolate Teddy Grahams as either dessert, or a snack with a cup of coffee.  It's a sweet pick-me up that doesn't leave me feeling too guilty.  Cures the need for chocolate, and has a nice crunch that sometimes I really want.  Oh yeah, and they're cute little bears!

review/summary: Betcha can't eat just one...
review/text: Received my Brazil nuts yesterday and I'm happy to say I'm really satisfied.<br />The added incentive to buying these nuts on Amazon is that I was unable to buy them from W-mart, they were unavailable for what seemed like months and I didn't feel like waiting any longer.<br />One reason for eating Brazil nuts is their high amounts of selenium plus they taste so good. Since I log my food intake on fitday.com it's comforting to see that only one Brazil nut to gets you the RDA of this important nutrient but not too much from mega dose vitamins.  I would rather get my nutrients from natural sources if possible rather than from supplements.<br /> One problem, trying to eat only one maybe two nuts takes some will power.<br />I'll be ordering again, that's for sure. The price was right and the shipping was fast.<br />One last note; I always store nuts in the fridge so they say fresher.
