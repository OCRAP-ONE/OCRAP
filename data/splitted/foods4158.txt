review/text: Arcor chocolate filled mints<br />I searched for these candies and for a good price on them. I think they are just right for stashing in your purse. They are a hard candy, not sticky. They are individually wrapped. They have the right ingredients....mint and chocolate. They are perfect for my use.

review/summary: New pet owner
review/text: I haven't owned a dog in over 25 years but I got a puppy in November 2010.  She was rescued (with her brother) because her mother was killed by a coyote.  The woman who rescued her hand fed the puppies with bottles.  When they started eating she put them on Science Diet.  I have read some pretty nasty comments about Science Diet in the reviews.  I agree with a guy that wrote that the results from feeding Science Diet speak for themselves.  My pet is perfectly healthy, full of energy, her stools are just right, and her coat is very shiny.  I guess it would be better if I could afford to have dog food made from products humans would eat. People seem to rave about these dog foods made from all healthy almost human consumable ingredients.  As my puppy is doing so well on this food, I am choosing to leave her with it till adulthood.  Then I will may shop for another brand.  As they say, why fix it if it ain't broke!

review/text: I love this tuna.  It's unlike any other tuna I've tasted.  I usually don't like canned tuna, but this is an exception.  I eat it for lunch right out of the can. It needs nothing else (no salt, pepper, mayonnaise) and doesn't have that canned tuna taste like others do!  Makes a great snack, too.  I like spicy, and the Thai Chili tuna is spicy  with a slight sweet flavor. It's my favorite.  Lots of flavor! Makes a wonderful light lunch with some zest.

review/text: This is the kind of creative food that keeps the Bumble Bee products at the top of our list.  When we head out fishing, we grab one of their wide range of products.  We would grab this particular one every time if we didn't know we would get tired of eating the same thing every time.  I do take two of these at a time, because the first one leaves me wanting a little more--but that's probably more of a reflection on the quality of the product than the portion.

review/summary: Oh Bumblebee, I WEEP with gratitude.
review/text: Forgive me for being overly dramatic, but I consider my quest for palatable, convenient lunch options as seriously as some people treat their personal finances, or stock portfolios. With my daily 3 hour commute, I have leisurely breakfasts and dinners only on weekends. Lunch is the only meal I may actually be *sitting down* to eat so I [expletive deleted] refuse to settle for something tasteless. I do not have a sweet tooth, and that eliminates half the things I can grab from a vending machine. Carbs put me in food coma, and so that eliminates the other half.  I do not have the discretionary income to eat fig and duck confit sandwiches from the fancy cafe next door to work, and that leaves me with having to quest for lunch options I can store in my office cupboard and prepare with the least hassle. Some of my finds  have been decent, some have made me cry at how desperate I had become to be eating something that tastes like the aftermath of drunk moose.  But this...this was tasty. Genuinely tasty.<br /><br />Ever since I got it out of "I wonder what this tastes like" curiosity at Target ages ago, it was love at first bite. This product smells strongly and cubicle dwellers may wish to note that but the kit is easy to store, the can is easy to open and if you have a napkin, you are all set. The tuna tastes amazing. Even if you are not fond of the fish in its other "tuna kit" or "chicken of the sea" avatars, the slightly spicy, slightly sweet, zesty flavor of this will appeal to those of you who like more flavor in your food. It is thick, chunky and not watery, so it is not messy to eat, and did I mention it is actually tasty? This may be the only thing of the many things stored in my office cupboard for food emergencies that I actually enjoy eating.<br /><br />Though sadly, most of my Thai Chili lunch kits get borrowed by colleagues with such astonishing regularity, that I am forced to have this on autoship. MONTHLY!

review/text: Purchase from the commissary! Perfect snack size, the combination of the crackers and tuna make very balance protein to carb ratio and total calories are under my 250 calorie per meal (eat small meals every 3 hours). Taste is spicey and yummy without a "sauce". I tried a different BRAND and it had a sauce in the tuna,yuck. Not this! I also used this to make tuna cakes and did not have to add ANY seasoning!  They were such a hit I had to go buy a case from the commissary to share with the ladies group!! Hoping Amazon will get it so that I can order it as an automatic subscription. Even my hubbie that is not a seafood person, loves it.

It seems like every time I put them out with snacks for guests, someone wants to know where they can be purchased.  They are so flavorful.  LOVE these!

review/summary: Delightfuly spicy and good tasting, 3 ounce tuna can in each packet, 130 calories tuna, 80 crackers
review/text: I really like tuna, but it can get boring. Not with the Thai Chili from Bumble Bee. It has a nice spice kick, and I can go spicer than most people I know, with even a little afterburn (not unpleasant to me at all). There are even one or two of the chilis that are pictured whole in each can.<br /><br />The crackers are just so-so and tend to crumble a little before you take them out. And they are not very good quality crackers. I personally can't have just this for lunch all the time. But you don't need much more: an apple, piece of cheese and you do have, for me, a full lunch. But you are also getting your calories worth. For 210 calories pretty darn filling.<br /><br />So crackers not great. But the tuna certaintly is. Tasty and light tuna is a good source of protein, selenium,vitamin B-12, niacin and iron. Also less mercury than albacore, but albacore does have more Omega-3s. For the price, taste, good use of calories: overall highly recommended.

review/summary: Like spicy Thai food? Then YES!
review/text: This is a tasty meal or treat and it comes with a little spatula to spread tuna on crackers.  My can had a whole red hot chili in it, but it was yummy and not too hot (well not for me, my family comes from the South and hot sauce is practically put into baby bottles!)  I tried the tomato basil, which is okay, but not as flavorful.  Got these for a snack bin in the living room that has healthy alternatives to chips and cookies.  the total calories only comes to 200, which is a great small meal to cut hunger and get in some protein, if you don't eat the crackers than it's only 110 calories! Save the crackers for soup some other day!  This will become a regular for me in the future---it's a great late evening snack!

review/summary: A travel staple
review/text: I travel in remote areas for work and my gear gets thrown around a lot.  I appreciate the box that the tuna kit comes in because the crackers are always whole, no matter what has happened.  I buy this tuna kit instead of other ones because it has the simplest ingredients: no corn syrup, no artificial weirdness, no modified anything.  The very small can is a good serving size for me.  The spice is pretty intense and I know many people who would not like it, but it is fine for me.  I usually mix in crushed kale chips to add a vegetable to my meal.  I often save the enclosed mini-spreaders and have started to save the plastic boxes to make other meal kits, so in a way, it is possible to reduce the amount of packaging wasted by this product. This is one of my travel staples and I always have some on hand.  I'm not giving it five stars only because there are tuna products out there (such as bonito del norte) that have far superior flavor and are the only ones that I give five stars.

The spice is noticeable but not burning, a perfect amount of kick for me.  When you open the can I recommend taking the pepper sitting on top and grabbing it on the pointy end and squeeze it so that the insides squirt out into the tuna, then toss the pepper skin.<br /><br />The only problem is that the kit is overpriced on amazon right now.. They go for $1.51 at target right now.  I want to buy bulk, but there needs to be a discount over the grocery store!

review/text: First off, the things listed in product features are untrue. It's just the Muddy Buddies which are peanut butter and chocolate covered Chex which are then heavily dusted with powdered sugar, or confectioner's sugar if you call it that. I make these all the time at home and there isn't a huge difference, however these are less chocolaty than I believe they would be using the recipe on a box of Chex.  You can toss the bag in the fridge if you prefer them cold like they would be if they were homemade.<br /><br />Overall I think that they're a good snack. They're nice for when you just can't make them yourself, say, going camping or living in a dorm. Also be sure to note the other reviewer. I did not purchase these from the seller. I am reviewing the product only.

review/text: I really like most of the Britt coffees.  This is one of my favorites.  It's not bitter, has great flavor and aroma.  It's too good(and expensive) to serve to a crowd, so buy something else for the crowd and hide this for your selfindulgence.

review/summary: OUT OF DATE PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: Having already ordered directly from Cafe Britt, I jumped at the chance to order Cafe Britt product from Amazon thus saving shipping costs and even getting a break on the price. My experience dealing with Cafe Britt was great. I ordered the 2lb bag of whole bean Costa Rica Dark Roast coffee and loved it.  Wanting to try something different, I ordered 2 1lb bags of Tres Rios valdivia whole bean coffee THRU AMAZOM.COM. Upon opening the first bag I noticed a difference in quality that was quite apparent. I assumed it was probably because of the different type of coffee, and only after opening the second bag did I think of looking for a freshness date on the packaging. Now I ordered this coffee on July 30 and received it on August 3rd but the package has a freshness date of JUN 12(lot # 11173407).  So it appears as if AMAZON shipped me coffee that was way out of date. I know my local grocery store is not going to sell food that is out of date so why is AMAZON doing it?<br /><br />Second Entry(8/25/11)<br />Having spoken to a customer service rep at Amazon, I have been told my out-of-date product will be replaced at no cost. I appreciate this and must commend Amazon for their responsiveness to my complaint.

review/summary: Makes a good tom yum soup.
review/text: I love Asian soups, generally, and tom yum talay is my favorite of the lot. This paste is a very easy way to get that taste at home. I simply add two teaspoons of this paste to 4 cups of water, add fresh mushrooms and white fish, and bring to a boil for a while. The soup is tasty and low-calorie. You should know, however, that the paste does have MSG (monosodium glutamate) in it. If you're not worried about that, I recommend the paste.

So, this stuff finally enabled me to make my favorite dish at home. Don't forget to buy some Thai (Birds Eye) Chilis to achieve the proper heat index. Be sure to buy the three pack. Amazon also sells this by the single jar at a much more inflated price. Well packed, it has always arrived in good condition, despite the glass jars. I am never without it.

review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

review/summary: At long last; a canned pepper that's not soggy!
review/text: I was born & raised in AZ, my father is a Mexican national (Naturalized). He set the bar pretty high when I was growing up for good quality Mexican food and peppers. When I was a teen, he found a Mexican brand of jalapeno's named Faro. They were great, but you had to buy the big restaurant size cans. The peppers were firm and had a crunch. Then they stopped importing them and for decades we didn't run across any good peppers. All the brands I've tried are soggy. At best, you may find 1/3-1/2 the can has some peppers with some firmness. The rest are soft and/or slimy. We have a family recipe of stuffed jalapenos, using pickled (canned). It requires the peppers to be firm enough to be sliced in half, stuffed with a cheese mixture; and them to support the contents when you pick it up and eat it. Most canned jalapenos turn to mush somewhere in this process; usually at the beginning.<br /><br />To note, I've tried La Costena, Herdez, La Preferida, Casa Fiesta, La Victoria and Ortega. I also tried Trappeys, which comes in a bottle. Their texture is fantastic, but it's not a traditional Mexican pickling. I did buy them for a while for this recipe and they did work great; then Giant Eagle stopped carrying them (I live in Ohio now). Then I was at a small Mexican grocer here and thought I'd pick up the hunt again so I could make the recipe. I grabbed some La Costena, because they're everywhere, and typically you can get a few firm ones in each can. I also grabbed a can of San Marcos, because I couldn't remember if I'd tried them.<br /><br />Let me tell you, these are as good or better than the Faro's my dad used to buy! Every one was firm and fresh, very crunchy for canned jalapenos. And the flavor is fantastic. Being from Mexico, they're canned with the traditional spices, as well as carrot pieces and some onion. My dad likes the carrots, I can't stand them; but they do add to the jalapeno flavor. Hint though. Don't buy them here. Shipping is more than the cost of the product! Just Google your city's name with the words Mexican Market. If I can find them in Akron, OH, you can probably find them in your town.<br /><br />I can't keep these in the house. I eat them with hot dogs, burgers, and sometimes I'll just smear some refried beans on a tortilla with some cheese and throw it in the micro for a minute, just so I can have a quick bean burrito to go along with my craving for these amazing peppers.<br /><br />For something different, try their Serrano peppers as well. Slight different flavor, and slightly hotter. Same texture. Enjoy!

It falls apart easily.<br />The slices have to be cut in half to put in the toaster.  There is not very much bread in a loaf, for the price paid.  I am not going to order that bread again.

In total I paid 14 $ for this snack.<br /><br />They looked kind of funkey, but what health food dosent? They were covered in this powdered chese like the kind got get in a Kraft Mac N' Chese box. All I could tase was the chese.<br /><br />I am going to stick to making them in my oven.<br />Strip Kale from the stem, place leaves in mixing bowl, add some salt, cayan pepper, and olive oil.<br />Place in oven @ 350, back for 20-25 min<br />Turn a few times and cook until crisp, but not too crisp.

review/summary: Fabulous pantry option!!
review/text: OK, so you know how you buy those wonderful-looking tortellini in the deli-case, sure they'll make a wonderful meal this week, except, well, life happens, and by 2 weeks from now you haven't even gotten around to them and have to throw them out?<br /><br />Thanks to the three reviewers here who actually reviewed the product, not just an ordering mix-up, we gambled and bought a whole case of these, sight unseen (later we found them at our local supermarket, same size, same brand, but higher price).<br /><br />Turns out, they're delicious!  My very picky husband raved about them two nights ago.  And we both love the fact that we have a luscious, simple meal on hand -- IN THE PANTRY!  No more crowding of the refrigerator, no more throwing out expired delicacies.<br /><br />If you ever stop to eat on the way home from work because you're too tired to cook anything complicated and you're not sure what's still fresh in the fridge, hurry:  order yourself up a case of these, and I'll bet you'll have that problem solved twice a week!<br /><br />Tip:  for a gourmet, restaurant-quality sauce that's even faster and that, like this, stays in the pantry until you need it, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012HP1CC">Bertolli Premium Pasta Sauce, Summer Crushed Tomato & Basil, 13.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a> -- microwaves in its own pouch in 90 seconds.  NINETY SECONDS!  NO POT!  Tastes "10 times better than the fresh tomato sauce in the deli case", says my husband.  Makes the tortellini into a gourmet dish too.<br /><br />Bet you didn't know you could put a gourmet dinner on the table in less than 20 minutes with only 1 pot -- the one to boil the pasta!  :)  And at only a little over $4 for two of you (no, both the pasta and sauce say they feed 3 people, and they both exaggerate -- count on 2), it's still a steal.  Compared to what you would have spent at the cheapest fast-food or take-out place?  And with only 1 pot (use one with a strainer built in, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5BIDE">Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 3-Quart Cook and Pour Saucepan with Cover</a>, so you don't even have to use a separate strainer!) plus 2 bowls plus 2 large spoons to wash, well, I don't think it gets much better than this!  :)

If I was going full carb, I'd still take the Scharffen, but for low-carb or sugar free this one is oustanding.  On top of that, their customer service was proactive, excellent, notifying me of a slight delay in shipping and actually refunding my shipping costs!  You don't find good service everyday and this was GREAT service.  <p>Great product plus great service = winning combination for me!  Try them for yourself.

review/summary: Surprise:  All of Xlear's Xylitol is from China!!!
review/text: I was about to order Xlear's 5-pound bag of Xylitol when I decided to check out where it comes from.  Like many people, I try hard to avoid any food products or ingredients from China.<br /><br />So I called the vendor of this product (the Vitamin Shoppe).  They said I would have to call the manufacturer to find out and gave me Xlear's phone number (801-224-0937).  That number wasn't too helpful because it didn't allow me to reach a live person, but after pursuing several extensions, I reached a live Xlear customer service rep at (877) 599-5327.  She immediately and firmly said that all Xlear Xylitol comes from China.  She added, "Most of the Xylitol you're going to find WILL be from China."<br /><br />As much as I love Xylitol, I'm determined not to buy any from China.  For the past year, I've been buying one-pound bags of "Emerald Forest" xylitol from my local grocery store.  The bags are marked "Made in the USA / U.S.-Grown Birch Trees."  So the news about Xlear's origins came as a surprise to me.<br /><br />However, the 1-pound local bags of Emerald Forest cost $10 each, so I was searching for a better price.  Guess I'll contact Emerald Forest to determine whether their larger sizes of Xylitol (the ones available on Amazon) are still from the U.S.  I'm willing to pay more to avoid consuming any food or supplements from China.<br /><br />And since erythritol is so similar to xylitol, this leaves me wondering where erythritol comes from....Has anyone checked that out?<br /><br />Decided to finish checking things out before posting this review.....So I just located emeraldforestsugar dot com, got the corporate phone number (866-948-1999) and immediately reached a live person.  She double-checked with a manager, then confirmed that even the largest sizes of Emerald Forest Xylitol sold on Amazon are indeed totally produced in the U.S.A. and that all Xylitol labeled "Emerald Forest" is strictly from U.S.-grown trees.  (And by the way, she mentioned that the mfr sells a 55-pound bag of U.S. xylitol, though I haven't had time to check out the price yet.)  This was all good news to me.<br /><br />While I was at it, I asked whether Emerald Forest's erythritol is also made in the USA, and she said, "Yes, but we're out of it right now--there's currently a shortage."<br /><br />I also asked about their xylitol gum (since I regularly buy Trident w/xylitol) and was somewhat dismayed to learn that EF's xylitol gum is their only product that does contain some Chinese ingredients.  But in about one month they expect to start producing a gum that is totally from U.S. ingredients.<br /><br />I'm giving this Xlear product only 2 stars because although Xylitol itself has worked great for me, I think the origin of this food product should have been clearly listed!

review/summary: Very Sweet
review/text: I totally love this product.  It bakes beautifully - it can be put on fruit and I imagine where every sweetness is needed. The exciting thing is when I bake brownies, cakes, cobblers, no can tell the difference.  It simply worth every dollar it costs.  Guess I am fortunate to as it is just for my husband and me and then we share with my baked goods.<br /><br />By the way the chocolate is EXCELLENT.  I love dark chocolate and it tastes that it is perhaps 60% cacao.

review/summary: Best Sugar Substitute for Coffee
review/text: The problem with stevia based sweeteners for coffee and thick drinks is the aftertaste. If you like the taste of French Roast, stevia based sugars will leave a bitter-sweet aftertaste that masks it. Xylitol may have 9.6 cal per tablespoon, but this is very acceptable compared to regular sugar, honey, and agave.<br /><br />I cannot believe some people are shortsighted enough to pan Xlear and Xylosweet simply because they have operations in The Peoples Republic of China. Strangely enough, Xylitol was discovered by Russian chemists many years ago and was first used there to manage diabetes. Just think if the food industry in The USA did not have such a stranglehold on the FDA, and Xylitol reached the penetration that it should. Type 2 diabetes and all of the other health related problems in the USA related to obesity and excess sugar intake would probably cut the cost of health care by over $40 Billion per year.<br /><br />So lets put things into perspective. Some people in the West have a problem with a company that operates in The PRC, but neither China nor Russia has ever introduced ASPARTAME and other unhealthy artificial sweeteners and enabled their respective regulatory organs to conspire with private concerns to cover up and mask the detrimental side effects of a product like Aspartame.<br /><br />Xylitol offers the best of both worlds, a 5 chain carbon sugar that does not metabolize like glucose, fights cavities, low calorie intake, and is perfect for coffee drinkers because of its lack of aftertaste. Coffee is where most people get their sugar, and if all the soda drinkers migrated to coffee with xylitol, obesity and type 2 diabetes would be cut by 70%.

review/summary: NOT GOOD FOR ESPRESSO MACHINE
review/text: After trying different Lavazza espresso whole beans i wanted to give this<br />one a try and ordered Lavazza Grand Espresso .I have checked the UK and<br />German sites to get some idea about the rating for this one since there are not enough reviews for this one. The ratings were not very impressive compare<br />to other Lavazza Whole Beans ( very close to Lavazza Super crema which i<br />have ordered through Amazon )but i wanted to make my own experience .<br /><br />When i oppened the package i saw seemingly oily coffee beans compare to other Lavazza or Illy Espresso beans.<br /><br />I have a Miele automatic espresso machine which was not very amused about<br />his new partner but it was too late to refuse the experiment.<br /><br />Grand Espresso has  a very good Crema which is a result of high Robusta  and normal bucket( aroma ) .Composition 40% Arabica 60 % Robusta .<br /><br />As Cappuccino i was not very impressed compare to other Lavazza Espresso<br />Beans .It tastes very weak ( i have used Whole Foods Whole Milk ).<br /><br />At the end you get what you have paid for. A lavazza brand which is in the<br />bottom of Lavazza Whole beans next to Lavazza super Crema and Lavazza Tierra.<br /><br />For me the first choice for Lavazza Espresso is Pienaroma if it is fresh ( i<br />have bought it through Amazon for about two years ago which was damaged/sour<br />but otherwise it is the top choice and the most expencive Lavazza in Europe)made from 100 % Arabica Beans and very Espresso Machine friendly like all other Lavazza beans (except Grand Espresso ! ) followed by Lavazza Top class.<br /><br />For Cappuccino my first choice is Lavazza Top Class which has a very nice chocolaty and sweet note followed by none ( even better than illy).<br /><br />For me the best Espresso is Illy dark roast (unfortunately overpriced )<br />followed by Lavazza Pienaroma ( best price/Quality ) .<br /><br />For Cappuccino i would always go with Lavazza top class followed by Segafredo<br />Extra Strong .<br /><br />I would not recommend Lavazza Grand espresso for espresso machines a la Miele<br />or Jura .The fat beans would cause damages for espresso machines .<br /><br />If you have regular / filter coffee machine i would see it comparable to Lavazza Super Crema or Tierra (which i also would definately NOT buy again ).

review/summary: Intelligentsia Organic French Roast: Direct Trade at its best
review/text: There is nothing quite like a cup of Intelligentsia coffee.<br /><br />It doesn't compare to any other coffee I have tried. Whatever brand I have tried, Intelligentsia surpasses it.<br /><br />Once you taste Intelligentsia coffee of any kind, it is hard to go back to other brands.<br /><br />The best reason to try Intelligentsia is their commitment to direct trade. They travel all over the world to interact and do business with small coffee farms. Intelligentsia pays growers 25 percent above the Fair Trade price. They have written contracts directly with these small farmers in these nations, and you can see photos of these farmers on their website on the pages of the coffee you are purchasing.<br /><br />Intelligentsia Coffee defines Direct Trade in 34 words: "Roaster and farmer collaborating in a meaningful and mutually beneficial way to create great tasting coffees which are fully traceable, highly differentiated, and definitively sustainable as measured by current social, economic and environmental indicators."<br /><br />There are videos by the folks that started Intelligentsia that explain Intelligentsia Coffee's company philosophy better; you can google for them. What Intelligentsia has done for the coffee trade is simply amazing and awe-inspiring.<br /><br />And it doesn't hurt that their coffee tastes absolutely delicious. Once you see all the steps that go into it, it is easy to understand why. Farmers revisit the coffee fields many times during the growing season, which lasts several months, to pick only the ripe berries. This is more labor-intensive: more picking requires that the laborers be paid more. It also results in better beans.<br /><br />I tip my hat to them: they have changed coffee as we know it. I find that now, when I shop for coffee, I ask more questions and do more label reading when I shop for coffee rather than just purchasing a bag. Intelligentsia is the first coffee company that taught me some personal accountability for what is in my coffee cup.

review/text: These are great to keep in the cabinet for a quick, delicious dinner remedy. We have health issues and try to eat sensibly, but there are those times when we're running late, don't have many groceries in the house, or just want some warm, comfort-food and this fits the bill.<br /><br />Edit: 8/13/09 - we like this product so much we now make it as a complete meal rather than just a potato side dish. They are REAL, thinly sliced potatoes with the skin still on and taste real. No phoney flavor or after taste. We now add left over veggies and diced ham to the mix and let 'er rip in the oven. The abundant cheese bubbles and browns on the top and thickens everything up creating a phenomenal casserole/one dish meal. I've also used tuna or chicken in lieu of the ham for a change of pace and that comes out great also. Usually use 2 boxes at a time in a 2-2.5 qt casserole. Served with a side salad it is a good, quick meal that really satifies and tastes great.

review/summary: Best tasting box of cheesy potatoes.
review/text: I eat 2 or 3 boxes a week of various brands and varieties of similar boxed potato with cheese products: potatoes au gratin, scalloped potatoes, etc.  I recently discovered these and they are now my favorite of this ilk.  I know taste is highly personal but, to me, these are the best-tasting.  It could be just some artificial flavoring in the sauce mix, but I don't care - I just like them.  And I also like that they leave the skin on.<br /><br />I'm glad to find them here, especially with Prime shipping.  These can be hard to find in my grocery stores.  Several times I have thought this is what I was buying, only to get home and discover it wasn't quite the same thing, such as the same brand "scalloped potatoes in a creamy sauce" which box looks almost an exact match but doesn't taste quite as good.<br /><br />P.S. For stove-top preparation, I find the instructions make it too runny so I use a bit less water.  And I add about a half cup of not-fat instant milk powder for added protein without noticing any taste difference.

review/text: Seaweed is a superfood and it is great to be able to eat it fresh like this (rather than dried seaweed which needs to be re-hydrated), and love that it contains 10 different types of seaweed. You must rinse the salt (used generously to keep the seaweed fresh) out multiple times. Toss with dressing for a salad, add to greens, soup, noodle salad or mix with a peanut/sesame/soy dressing and eat with brown rice. My kids love seaweed and this isone of my favorite new food finds.

I have been telling everybody about the delicious mixture while warning them that they will not be able to get enough.  You can taste the cocoa butter, sea salt, dark chocolate, vanilla and almonds individually at times. The dark chocolate is so smooth and not bitter at all. I tend to buy a few bars at a time, when I can find them.  The stores tend to run out of this flavor first; and now I know why.

Did not try as supplement, so not sure of taste.  4 bags, if reconstituting, is way too much, as 1/3 cup whey makes one quart reconstituted.  You may want to try to find one bag if trying for the first time. The 4 bags fit in a 4 quart storage jar.  Recipe for reconstitution is on Bob's Red Mill website.<br />I only gave it 4 stars because I did not taste the product. So, I am not sure what it would taste like if buying for supplement.

review/text: I am not a fan of any of the other Fiber One snack bars I have tried, and believe me I have tried a lot. When I saw these brownies at the store I had to give it a shot, and I was surprised how much I liked them. They are not too sweet even though they are flavored with sugar and not an artificial sweetener. They are a little on the thick and dense side, but that is to be expected with sort of product. I have noticed a bit of a coffee or licorice taste-but it is not too heavy and I tend to like this taste anyway.<br /><br />The bars are relatively small, only .89oz or 25 grams-but that is not a surprise considering it is a 90-calorie bar. As far as fiber bars and such go-this is one of the best I have tried. The price at the grocery is only about $2.65 for a 12 pack-so shop around a little before buying these.<br /><br />Ingredients I got off the back of the package: Wheat Flour Bleached, Chicory Root Extract, Sugar, Vegetable Oil (canola, palm, palm kernel, Fructose, Cocoa Processed with Alkali, Sugarcane Fiber, Vegetable Glycerin, (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, Corn Starch, Salt, Natural Flavor, Nonfat Milk, Why, Sesame Oil, Xanthan Gum, Locust Bean Gum, Soy Lecithin.

review/text: My wife and I as well as other family members really like this brownie as a low calorie snack. No, it does not taste the same as the mouth watering chocolate brownies with hundreds of calories that my local bakery sells. But for a low calorie brownie it tastes pretty good. Here is why we like it.<br /><br />1. This has a soft texture, but it's not too crumbly.<br /><br />2. This has a good chocolate taste unlike some of the other low calorie chocolate items that I have tried.<br /><br />3. For me this is not too dry, but rather is moist enough.<br /><br />4. Although this is not a health food bar, it does have 5g fiber, only 8g sugar, 100mg sodium and 1.5g saturated fat. So beside being low in calories, it is not junk food.<br /><br />Shop for price. I currently buy a 38ct Box at my local Costco for just under twelve dollars.

review/text: These are surprisingly good considering how much fiber they have.  These brownies have 20% of your daily fiber.  They are sweet but a little on the dry side.  The fudge brownies are a little more moist than these but aren't as easy to pick up, especially in bulk.  Like others have said, shop around and you'll find it cheaper than here.  For the price Amazon is charging, it really should be a pack of 3 of these boxes.  I paid seven ninety-eight at a local sams club for one box of 24ct to give you an idea.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone trying to get a little healthier of a snack and add more fiber to your diet.

review/summary: I can't believe it tastes so good, and is good for you!
review/text: As a dieter, I'm always looking for great tasting snacks that are also good for you. These do the job nicely. Be sure to drink a lot of fluids as you're ingesting fiber too.

review/summary: a little too powerful!
review/text: maybe it's because i'm a vegetarian who eats really healthy (as in not a junk food vegetarian--basically, i get a TON of fiber in my day to day food already) but my gastrointestinal tract just can't handle these fiber one brownies! they're so delicious and low calorie that i want to eat them all day long, but if i eat one, i'm strapped to the toilet all night long.

review/summary: Opened packages
review/text: Everything arrived on time, but I am rather concerned as 2 of the containers were open- on one of them  the flaps on the top had been glued and then taped (with packing tape) back together, and the other, one of the top flaps was not glued down. . Will not be buying from this seller again. The brownies were fresh & not past their expiration date, and they tasted ok, but it makes me nervous knowing the packaging had been tampered with.

review/text: I bought this item with a bit of reservation.  My thought was that it might be too sweet or too artificial tasting for my liking.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find it tasted very good.  I plan to purchase more.

review/summary: Hot apple cider
review/text: You get alot for your money. When you have a minute to sit back and relax and enjoy a nice hot apple cider. Tastes pretty good. There's no reason hot apple cider should be a seasonal drink.  So with this six pack you get plenty to last you awhile. A pretty smart idea.

review/summary: this cider is addicting!
review/text: This is the second set I've bought. You just heat up some water and add a few teaspoons and it makes your worst day better. I bet this would be good with a bit of rum on a cold winter's night to help warm up and relax. YUM!

review/summary: Just ok.
review/text: The good news... these breadsticks are very light and crispy.<br /><br />The bad new... these breadsticks are pretty bland. I've had other unflavored breadsticks that still managed not to be bland so that is not the problem.<br /><br />If you are going to use these for dipping then you definitely will enjoy them but on their own they are just ok.<br /><br />One other thing, about 75% of my breadsticks arrived broken into 2, 3, or even 4 pieces.
