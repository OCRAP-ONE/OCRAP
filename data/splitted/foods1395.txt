review/summary: My husband is a ketchup snob.
review/text: Both my husband and I started a low sugar/higher fiber diet.  We are taste testing everything sugar-free but sweetened with natural sugar alcohols (like xylitol).  Since Nature's Hollow is the only one with xylitol, I ordered it.  My husband doesn't like it.  He felt it tastes just like tomato sauce 'not' ketchup.  And so now refuses to eat it.  I, on the other hand, think it's fine.  Guess I will be the one finishing this bottle.  It is on the runny side but if the taste was there it would not be a problem.  I ordered Heintz One Carb ketchup to see if he will like that.  Even though it's basically sweetened with splenda (sucralose), that'll be the 'one' concession to an artifical sweetener.  This is proving to be a real hard diet to keep up if you are set on it being a 'natural' one.

review/text: A couple of the Thai restaurants we go to in SF will give you a couple of pieces of this candy after your meal.  I love the taste of tamarind candy.  It's a slightly tangy, citrusy (almost orange/tangerine-liked) flavor.  The workers at the restaurants tell me that they have it ordered and shipped from Thailand.  I haven't tried looking for it in the Asian markets but being a global economy, you'd think you can find it in the stores without having to resort to Amazon to buy it!

It's also wonderful over seared scallops and roasted chicken.  This is that ingredient that will add depth to a dish and have your guests wondering what's in it.  I use it quite sparingly, as I enjoy the delicate flavor of the truffles.  The gourmet flavor is well worth the price.

review/text: natural truffle oil dispersed in sunflower oil, good deal for the price. Tastes really good on pasta, potatoes, veggies, pizza. Flavor could be a bit stronger though. I feel like I have to add a lot of oil ( must dribble a few tablespoons on a small pizza ) to get a strong truffle flavor. It's ok sometimes, like on pasta, but sometimes I don't want my food to be so oily (e.g. pizza), adds a lot of calories etc. I like strong flavors though, so if you want just a tiny hint of truffle less may work for you. overall pretty tasty for the price

review/text: In writing this review, I must preface by saying not everyone loves truffle oil.  My husband nearly gags everytime he smells it and others have said it smells like we have a gas leak!  Fortunately I beat to my own drum and inspite of the comments I love this stuff!  There is a resaurant in Encinitas, CA that serves Truffle oil and parmesan cheese tossed popcorn with some herbs on top.  With a nice glass of wine it is an amazing treat.  So I decided to make my own at home and this oil is perfect for it.  I also use it on salads and potatoes but you need to make sure you like it first as it may be an aquired taste!

review/summary: Yummy, if small cookies
review/text: I think these were formulated using the "and-then-the-flood" school of culinary thought. Chocolate cookies with chocolate chips and white chips and chewy texture AND fudge in the center.<br /><br />My main complaint was that they were too small. I'm pretty sure that cookies like original Chips Ahoy! are smaller than when I was a kid (and it ain't because my hands are bigger) and that's OK. Nothing is like it was when we were kids (said the old poop). However, these seem smaller even than "regular" cookies...and you must consider the source here, I'm not a regular cookie eater. I would rather spend my calories on a hand full of chips than dessert usually.<br /><br />There IS a dessert eater in my house...and he approved of these, but they were not his favorite. So we give this 2 and a half (translated in Amazonian to 3) stars. Good for something different, but not likely to displace your favorite cookie.

review/text: These cookies are really gooey and chocolaty, more scrumptious than any human being can withstand! They taste like super rich brownies with the extra quality of being gooey. At 150 calories per cookie, this bag contains enough food energy to blow most bank vault doors off their hinges, so be forewarned! Nabisco has gotten the ingredients right with this one also. As you may know from my other reviews, I am very hard on manufacturers who do not use acceptable ingredients. This has my seal of approval. So, if you are not concerned about counting calories, or if you are one of those rare individuals who actually CAN eat just one, then see if you can withstand the rapture of eating these.

review/summary: Not nearly tasty enough for the calories.
review/text: For every two small cookies that you eat, you are ingesting 150 calories.  That seems WAY higher than it should be for the flavor that you get.  (I would much rather eat one and a half 100 calorie packs of randomn cookies for the cost of those calories...)<br /><br />Additionally, although not GROSS, I just don't think that they taste nearly as good as other more normal chocolate chip cookies.  (It really must be the gooey center, which, though very sweet, doesn't really add much oomph, and, in my opinion, wasn't very tasty).<br /><br />I was disappointed by these and would never purchase them.  Not recommended for Chips Ahoy Lovers.<br /><br />* One bright side, however, the packaging is pretty good.  The top has an innovative cover which peels open to reveal the cookies, but allows itself to be resealed (with the sides sticking back to the top again, creating an airtight seal).

It seemed more like they were pressed out of a mold.<br /><br />This all being said, I did eventually eat the whole bag but I would never buy them again.<br /><br />I would most certainly never recommend these to anyone.

review/summary: Not Bad, But Not Great
review/text: We tend to be homemade cookie fans around our house. But, for those times when we do pick up a package of store bought, Chips Ahoy's regular chewy chocolate chip cookies are usually among the top choices. So I thought these would be worth a try. They are good - nothing phenomenal or fantastically exciting, though. I will say that I don't think Chips Ahoy did as well with the chocolate cookie as they do with regular chewy chocolate chip cookies.<br /><br />What I expected: A moist, chewy cookie with a slightly runny, "gooey" center. Essentially, I expected something like the picture on the package.<br /><br />What I found: A slightly less moist than expected cookie with a center that was more like fudge - not hard, but also not gooey.<br /><br />Bottom line: The kids definitely thought they were good, even my spoiled "homemade cookie only" son. Because they were not gooey, they also weren't very messy. That makes serving one to busy kids does not result in chocolate everywhere! I did like that. I doubt these will make it to the "top choices" category, but we enjoyed the package we tried.

They seemed kind of moist to me.  2 were stuck together.  I didn't like that. (Editors note: Moist is good!)<br />- Awesome.  I like the fudgy center and the crunchy white chocolate chips.  I bet if you heated them in the microwave, it might be like they just came out of the oven.<br />- Very soft and fluffy with an even softer, gooey center. It's small and light which makes the addition of chocolate chips a bit too much. Would have been much better if it were a plain chocolate cookie with a fudge filling.

review/text: When it comes to cookies, especially the soft cookies, I'm usually the first in line.  So I was excited to see the new Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.  Unfortunately, the megafudge description never made it into my package.  It turned out to be a major letdown.<br /><br />Now, these cookies seemed to have plenty of chocolate, but you never could taste it.  In fact, they were bland.  The cookies were a bit on the dry side with moments of gooey morsels that did little to introduce flavor of their own.  It's hard to downplay a cookie described as megafudge as not having much taste, but it's true.  Hopefully the other varities are more appealing.

review/text: I requested two types of Chips Ahoy!'s newest cookies.  These were tasty, and the others were not.  So don't interpret this review as relevant to similar cookies... just these alone.<br /><br />The cookies tasty chocolatey and don't have an overpowering processed aftertaste one finds with many foods of this type.  They are very sweet, but you can tell you're eating a chocolate cookie.  In moderation (I had two at most at a time) it's decent and easy snack.  They are very chewy, almost a dough consistency, but the cookie doesn't fall apart easily. I think the frosting center helps the cookie's structure.<br /><br />Very good with a cup of black coffee.

review/summary: Choco-Overkill
review/text: Ok, maybe it's just getting older, but this is overkill. I can eat a handful of chocolate chips but 2 of these cookies make that handful seem like being on a low-cal diet. If you are a kid or a real chocolate addict, you'll like them, but for the rest of us, it's just too much of a chemical buzz

review/summary: Excellent for store bought cookies... great for FUDGE/Brownie lovers!
review/text: I received a package of both these and the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge... so I will compare both of them.  These are excellent cookies for a store bought cookie. They are soft and have a great flavor.  I am a big brownie person and so I totally gobbled up this variety and LOVED them. My husband, on the other hand, is an avid chocolate chip lover and greatly preferred the Chocofudge version.  Lots of chocolate inside makes it an awesome cookie... no more plain cookie if you happen to be low on chips in each bite. EACH bit is guaranteed chocolate since it has a nice chocolate center, and the cookie itself is like a mild brownie/cookie cross, so it's REALLY great for a chocoholic! But it's not overbearing at all, it's really done quite nicely.  My only complaint is really towards store cookies in general: they all have a tendency to have that store bought chemical taste (I think it's the preservatives). Nothing quite like homemade in that regard!  So I took off a star for that. SOME expensive brands somehow mange this by having quick expiration dates, and if you want to spend the money on those it's worth it!  I didn't have any crumbly issues... my package arrived safe and intact!

review/summary: Small thin and came across more Dry than gooey
review/text: I think it is not a great sign when a package of cookies in a house with 5 people ends up being tossed before being finished.<br />THey were not horrible but I would not want to spend money on these or reccomend them.<br />First off they are fairly small and thin, not that smaller protions sizes for desserts are bad, it is just not condusive to the idea of GOOEY.<br />I found these to be way more "dry" and couldn;t really see what was supposed to be "gooey"

review/summary: mmehh
review/text: The description sounded great but the cookies didn't really live up to the promise.  It is not that the cookies were terrible, they weren't - but they weren't particularly good either - just 'mmehh'.  The chocolate had a funny 'off' sort of taste.  The texture was rather dry and crumbly.  There are lots of cookies I like better, including just regular Chips Ahoys. If I am going to indulge in this much fat and calories I want something that tastes a whole lot better than these.

review/summary: Not the best cookies ever, but very snarfable
review/text: Chips Ahoy! is a mass-production outfit, so there's always going to be something a bit industrial about the cookies they turn out. These are definitely very edible and, if not exactly addictive, I could (and did) find myself putting away more of them than I should at one sitting. These all-chocolate ones ("Megafudge") are better than the traditional version, but still, the quality of the chocolate was, again, industrial at best. My wife, who knows her chocolate, said it tasted like they were trying to craft something darker than milk chocolate without the characteristic bitterness of true dark chocolate. She didn't think they succeeded. But if you're not looking for a connoisseur cookie experience and just need something for the snackin', these might not be bad to keep in the cabinet. If they make it there before you eat them all.

review/summary: Tasty for a store-bought cookie
review/text: I mostly make my cookies from scratch, but it's nice to have an emergency treat on hand. These cookies are soft (for those that fall into the "I love soft, not crunchy" cookie camp).<br /><br />They have a cocoa taste and a bit of creamy fudge in the center. This improves when you stick it in the microwave for a few seconds.<br /><br />The only thing I think is a negative, is the package is bulky for how many cookies you end up getting. I wish they gave us more for our money.<br /><br />Having said that, they are tasty in a store-bought way.

review/summary: bad after taste
review/text: Marginally better than the regular Gooey Chips Ahoy, but it still didn't leave a great impression.<br /><br />Personally, I didn't care for the taste that was full of preservatives and was the furthest thing to the standard home or stored baked cookies. It's interesting that they were able to keep the chocolate soft inside the cookie, but it didn't add any value to the cookie. The cookie was indeed soft, crumbly, w/ lots of chocolate inside but the overall taste was just too unnatural to enjoy.<br /><br />It's not something I'd recommend.

These are probably not a product I would buy in large quantities for my family,<br /><br />I liked that this is a soft cookie and there is a center full of chocolate.<br /><br />I did not like that the chocolate seemed to have a funny artificial aftertaste and that the cookies fell apart easily.

review/text: I thought this cookie was decent tasting for a store-bought cookie, thus the 4-star rating (it would only be 3-star if including homemade).  The texture was a bit too soft, with the cookie having a tendency to crumble.  I tried this cookie at room temperature, cold, and heated in the microwave, and it remained good for store-bought but there are others I like better.  My favorite thing about this cookie really was probably the easily resealed package....

review/summary: Not Bad for a Grocery Store Cookie
review/text: These cookies are okay for grocery store cookies made with preservatives.  They aren't as good as Nestle Tollhouse or Mrs. Fields but they're better than the unrecognizable brands one might buy at a gas station.  The "gooey" filling is surrounded by a chocolate "shell" within the cookie and makes for contrasting textures - soft cookie, chocolate shell and gooey center.  While these are in the Chips Ahoy line, they are quite different from the original.  Not better or worse.  Just different.<br /><br />I prefer the "Megafudge" Chips Ahoy over the "Chocofudge".

review/text: I'm a "soft cookie" fan, and these cookies fit the bill. They're nice and chewy. Best of all, they're super chocolately! They're not very big, but that's okay because the flavor is so rich. I couldn't eat a lot at a time, but for a decadent snack, these are perfect. My kids loved them, too. If you like soft, chewy cookies and chocolate, you won't be disappointed in the Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.

review/summary: Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge
review/text: Maybe it's me, but I was deeply disappointed in Chips Ahoy's Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies. First, they're the size of a half-dollar and crumbled when I picked them up, so that makes them a little dry. Not mega; not chewy gooey. They were packed with white chocolate chips (although, I wished they were macadamia nuts). They had a slight chocolate flavor but not fudgy that's for sure.<br /><br />There are about 15 cookies to the package, but for some reason my package must have shifted in shipping and many of my cookies were in pieces. Needless, to say I wasn't happy with this cookie.

review/text: I am the world's greatest fan of the original Chip's Ahoys.  Have loved 'em for decades and they are my "go to" cookie.  But --- these Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge are just not my cup of tea (sorry for that metaphor).<br /><br />I like chewy fresh baked cookies.  And I like the rather crispy original Chips Ahoys!.  But these things are neither.  To my tastes, they are just a somewhat soggy, crumbly, ultra-megadose of chocolate.<br /><br />I love to give glowing reviews when I can, especially for my favorite brand names -- but I'll leave my share of these cookies to rabidly addicted over the top chocolate fudge addicts.  These are just not for me.

review/summary: Chewy Gooey Mega-Mess!
review/text: I am reviewing these cookies from the sample that I received via the Vine program.  Admittedly, I did not get to try them at their best.<br /><br />The package arrived broken to smithereens, and in 100+ degree weather (Florida summer) that had fused the leaking fudge and crumbs into a unpalatable mess (see photo uploaded).  Getting over the look, I tried a clump, but I did not like the taste or the now "gritty" texture.  I honestly can't say if this was because they had been smashed and "re-baked," or if this was the original taste and texture, but I expect the former.  They seem more brownie-like than cookie, but again, that could be because of the way I received them.<br /><br />Once again, I am reviewing the sample that I received, hence I am giving a mediocre three-star review: not bad, but not good either.  The best I can suggest is that you buy these from your local grocery store.  Shipping fudge cookies in the heat of summer is definitely not the way to go!

review/summary: I wish the cookies were as good as the package!
review/text: The first thing I noticed about these cookies was the package. Even the most careless kid or husband (or maybe wife, to be fair about it!) is going to find it easy to close this package and keep the cookies fresh....<br /><br />That is, if you care that they are fresh. After I opened the package I found the cookies were all stuck together (Witness my spouse's comment, "Hey, those are BIG cookies!" To which I replied, "No, that is three cookies stuck together. ").<br /><br />After separating the cookies, I broke one in half and found that the result was a crumbled exterior and an interior that resembled partially cooked cookie dough more than a "gooey" filling.  It was not at all what I expected from the description or the picture on the bag.<br /><br />The taste was not too bad, but it was a bit salty-tasting, as others have noted.<br /><br />To be fair, this cookie would probably appeal to kids, but I would make them eat it outside or at the table; else there will surely be a lot of crumbs. Adults who just want some chocolate to go with a cup of coffee might find it satisfactory also. But for both there are probably better choices.

review/text: There's not much I can think of to say for this product other than the kiddos and I joyously devoured these yummy, chocolatey, chewy cookies.  We experimented with a few to heat them slightly in the microwave and some we tried to make ice cream sandwiches, that was slightly messy...but it was all good.  Heck, my niece willing, yet slightly grudgingly, ate a serving of cooked spinach just so she could eat more of them. If that's not a positive endorsement, I don't know what is.

review/text: The calories in these are unbelievable for the tiny size (only a little bigger than Girl Scout Thin Mints).  They're also incredibly addictive, even though they're really a bit overly sweet to my taste.  They have that kind of artificial softness and bright, sharp taste a lot of the more artificial cookies have also.<br /><br />On the other hand, I can't say I didn't enjoy them and feel like I ate way too many.  I do recommend microwaving.<br /><br />Here is the link to the nutrition info:<br />[...]<br /><br />Each cookie weighs about 15 grams and manages to be 75 calories!<br /><br />I will say they're easy to eat and appealing in some "can't stop" way but...I'd kind of be happy to not have them in my apartment again.

review/summary: Too sweet, not gooey enough
review/text: I was a little disappointed by the Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge.<br /><br />First, the good news.  I liked the density of white chocolate chips, as well as the chocolate flavor of the cookies.  Both excellent.  However, I didn't like the consistency of the cookie, the cloyingly sweetness, and not much of a fan of the gooey interior.  As others suggested, I heated the cookie for 20-30 seconds in the microwave prior to eating.  The cookie was far too crumbly, and broke apart in my hands.  The interior, while gooey as promised, did not contrast sufficiently in texture with the exterior cookie shell; the whole cookie felt soft, crumbly, and gooey.  I would've appreciated some differentiation.<br /><br />Kids seem to love 'em, but adults, not so much.

review/summary: Delicious but Too Messy!
review/text: Nabisco's new Chips Ahoy! Chewy, Gooey, MegaFudge cookies are incredibly rich.  With a soft cookie that tastes more like a brownie, chocolate and white chocolate chips on the outside, and a soft and creamy chocolate filling, they definitely fulfill any chocolate craving you might have.  Of course, with so much chocolate jammed in, each little cookie (much smaller than you'd expect) has 75 calories in it.  So it is probably best to share a pack of these with friends, rather than give in to temptation and eat a big handful.<br /><br />While the taste is amazing, the cookies are ridiculously messy.  They literally fell apart in my hands when I picked them up out of the container.  The fudge filling is so soft and liquidy that it has the consistency of chocolate syrup rather than fudge sauce.  Using something so fluid as the center of the cookie seems like a way to guarantee they won't hold their shape.  Add to that the fact that the solid cookie part is extremely crumbly and the chocolate chips have a tendency to fall off, and you've got a recipe for disaster.  These cookies are without a doubt the messiest I've ever eaten.  I lost more to the floor and my shirt than I managed to get into my mouth.  I want a cookie that I can pack in my lunch or grab and snack on easily.  These certainly don't meet those needs.  Despite their amazing taste, they aren't worth the clean-up effort.

review/summary: Grainy chewy...better warm
review/text: Chips Ahoy new cookies are really not gooey or even mega fudge. Many other cookies are far more fudgey and far more gooey. They are okay to eat, if you do not mind a slight grainy texture. I did receive these on a warm 90+ degree day and tried them immediately, they were much better warm - like right out from the oven. The packaging is also done well, even after shipping there was very little breakage, which means these would travel well, and since they really aren't all that gooey they are not quite as messy as some others.<br /><br />Two cookies are about 150 calories, quite a lot for a cookie such as this, there is also 7 grams of fat and  110 mg of sodium, 21 g of carbohydrates. You need to weigh! the diet choices and decide if these are worth all of that to you. Personally I do not think these will be on my future shopping list.

The are not particularly soft, and they do not taste as good as the normal "Chips Ahoy" pre-made cookies.  The "dough" tastes more artificial, and you cannot taste the white chocolate chips at all, as the entire this is overpowered by the "fudge" in the middle.<br /><br />I am not a HUGE fan of pre-made/artificial cookies, but I have found the pre-made Chips Ahoy brand's normal chocolate chip cookies to be tasty in the past.  So I am going to say that just this new product is lacking something, and not the brand itself.<br /><br />2 stars.

review/text: These Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are really not that.  They are large and securely packaged in a re-closeable package.  However, they are not really chewy, just sorta crumbly. Gooeyness seems to imply that they are hot from the oven or short from loads of butter, and I didn't find them to possess that quality. They taste of cheap chocolate and the chips are not any different in flavor from the dough part.  They might be gooier if you left them in a hot car or something.  If you like this brand then you might like them, otherwise I would choose something else.

review/summary: Good, but definately processed and with HIGH calories
review/text: As a choco-holic, I'll pretty much eat anything with the word "chocolate" on it. While I haven't had any Chips Ahoy cookies for a long time, I was excited to have a chance to try out with tasty-sounding little fudge cookies. Sadly, when I got them they were incredibly warm from the brutal Texas summer, so I had to stashed them in the refrigerator for a while, so my first experience with these cookies was chilled.<br /><br />And..they were good, delicious and very rich and decadent. It's basically a chocolate cookie with some fudgy stuff in the center, complete with a handful of chocolate chips infused with the entire thing. These things are like rich sugar incarnate, which isn't a bad thing, except that after about two cookies they become so rick that you just can't stomach them anymore.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that these cookies taste very processed and smeared in preservatives, so they can come off a little "fake" tasting.<br /><br />But the biggest letdown? just 2 cookies are 150 calories. Yeah, seriously.<br /><br />Probably the best part of this was the new resealable package, which makes life much easier -no clips or ziploc bags needed to keep the cookies fresh.<br /><br />This may work for children or some people, but I just couldn't get fully into these. I'd rather spend my money on something else...

review/summary: Ok if you love chocolate and processed snack foods
review/text: Our household is divided on the subject of these cookies.  My short review would be "Ok, not great, super chocolately but a little dry and processed-tasting."  My daughter's, on the other hand, was "Too much of a good thing turns out to be disgusting."<br /><br />These are Chips Ahoy chewy-style cookies with chocolate turned up to 11.  They have chocolate flavored dough, chocolate chips, and a fudge center.  They come in the Chips Ahoy resealable pack, where you can pull back a flap on the top, then re-close it and let the post-it style glue hold it closed.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />- These are very chocolatey.  I might prefer them to a regular Chips Ahoy, just for the intensity of the chocolate experience.<br /><br />- They stay pretty soft and chewy.<br /><br />What could have been better:<br /><br />- These are currently pretty pricey.  I think you can do a lot better if you are willing to spend more than four dollars per pack of cookies.<br /><br />- They are very dry.  Have a glass of milk ready.<br /><br />- They taste a little processed.  Although they are soft and super chocolatey, there's a preservative taste to them that's just a little off.<br /><br />- My daughter is an extreme chocolate fan and likes Chips Ahoy, so she was excited to try these, but stopped after one.  In her opinion, it's too much chocolate per cookie, and too machine processed.  (The three star rating is my opinion - she would probably give the cookies one star).

review/summary: Good Cookies But Arrived in Crumbs
review/text: From the moment I first opened these Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies I knew my time with this cookie would be short. Two main reasons - I have a sweet-tooth and as soon as my wife got home these cookies would become an endangered species.<br /><br />Yes, these Chewy Gooey cookies are that good. No, probably not as good as grandma's secret fudge cookie recipe that's been handed down in your family for generations. But when compared to similar national cookie brands they're delish! The cookies themselves are slightly smaller than the traditional Chips Ahoy! Chocolate Chip cookies we've all had. The texture of the cookies was a bit less gooey than I expected given the title but seven seconds in the microwave took care of that problem! These cookies are a pleasant combination of salty and sweet which was also a bit surprising but I found it to my liking.<br /><br />The package itself is smaller than I expected and I wish I could comment on how many cookies come in a sleeve. Unfortunately some items are probably better bought in store rather than shipped. My cookies arrived mostly in crumbles and only a few of the cookies resembled anything like an actual cookie. Compliments to Nabisco on the packaging which opens on top and is resealable.<br /><br />All in all I found these cookies deliciously chocolaty though I would probably not purchase them from Amazon.

review/summary: Good but not so so gooey
review/text: My 10 year old son loves chocolate but wasn't particularly impressed by these cookies. For a Chips Ahoy product, they are good, but there's still a "manufactured cookie" quality to it, versus a small batch or homemade quality. The base cookie is not dry, but spongey. There are 2 kinds of chips that have a nice sweet taste that go good together. The main issue I found is the claim it is gooey. I think that's an overstatement. While there is a small amount of fudge goo in the middle, it doesn't make the whole cookie gooey. If anything, a moderate sensation of gooeyness is produced once you chew the entire cookie in your mouth, but it's nowhere near, say, a chocolate fudge brownie. These are more light and soft, not thick and gooey.

review/text: Sorry, but I can't say too many good things about this product.  First of all, the texture is like cardboard; either that or my package was stale.  Second of all, they have the most unnatural taste of any cookie I've ever eaten.  I expected better on this as the regular Chips Ahoy aren't too bad.  And it wasn't soft and gooey inside, it was dry and hard.

review/summary: Sadly, Not to My Taste
review/text: Both my husband and I are dark chocolate fans, so this cookie looked quite tempting.<br /><br />At first bite, we both got a favorable impression: chewy (not as gooey as advertised, for which I was thankful, as gooey is not a favorite of mine), with a rich dark chocolate taste. My husband is a fan of white chocolate while I am not, so he found the chips a welcome treat.<br /><br />However, along with being chewy, the cookies have a grainy quality, and, to my taste, are excessively sweet. They also leave a rather heavy aftertaste in your mouth which is not pleasant.<br /><br />Coupled with the fact that you only get about 18 cookies for $4.50, I would take a pass on these. Only recommended for those who like their chocolate cookies very sweet.

review/summary: Not bad for a packaged cookie.
review/text: Chip's Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are the latest addition to the family of Chip's Ahoy cookies.  The picture on the front shows a soft cookie gently being split in two with gooey chocolate oozing out.  Random chocolate chips, both dark and white are scattered about.  Should be chocolicious.<br />The cookies aren't bad.  There was no discernible liquid goo in the center, but more of a sensation of slightly underbaked cookie.  The texture is OK, it definitely is a very strong chocolately flavor, and overall will satisfy the need for a chocolate cookie.  If you have no other options.<br />Generally, a homemade cookie will beat out a packaged cookie every time.  So, lets just compare this cookie to other packaged cookies.  Nothing holds a candle to Oreo's because they are in a class all by themselves.  Compared to the rest of the cookies out there, these are pretty good (note 3 star rating).<br />They are packaged in an extremely noisy resealable package, ostensibly to keep them fresh.  You won't be sneaking anything out of this package, in fact, don't go looking for one in the middle of the night because you'll wake up your whole household, and possibly your neighbors.  The reseal option is nice, keeps them safely contained and might add to the freshness.  With the number of preservatives listed on the label, not sure if freshness will be an issue.<br />Overall, not bad, not great.  Kids will love them.

review/summary: Machine flavored and good when there is nothing else available
review/text: With a fudge interior, you would expect there to be some awesome chocolate flavor floating through it.<br /><br />Well there's flavor alright. It's just a processed, chemical-ridden conception of chocolate. And the dough (if you can call it dough) melts like gruel in your mouth.<br /><br />I guess these would be great when the nuclear fallout happens. Not only would they survive the apocalypse but would remind me of the days when we could actually eat chocolate, not some processed lab junkie's idea of what chocolate might taste like.<br /><br />The second star is for their nutritional value during the fallout. If I need to reach a 1000 calories a day to survive, eating 6 of these would bring me halfway there.

review/summary: Pleasant, not outstanding.
review/text: A lot of people have already reviewed these cookies, so I will add try to keep my comments succinct.<br /><br />These "cookies" to my taste are really more of a moist brownie.  They have the texture and taste of a brownie.  If you like brownies, you'll probably like these.  If you don't, you probably won't.  They are moist, rather than dry and brittle, and I found that to be a plus.<br /><br />At 150 calories per two cookies, megafudge may mega-size your butt in no time.  However, you don't select something entitled "gooey megafudge" because you are calorie conscious.  Eaten in moderation and coupled with strenuous exercise, you can probably consume these cookies and still live to near your life expectancy.<br /><br />My one caveat for the chocoholic was the condition I received my product.  The cookies had received rough handling and had virtually crumbled.  My box didn't ship well and I think that is probably due to the softness of the cookie.  Since anyone purchasing the product from here needs to have it shipped, this might be a consideration.<br /><br />Three stars, one star lost for being uninspired and one deducted for the poor condition of the food item after shipping.  Recommended with reservations.

review/summary: Three words to describe this:  chocolatety, chocolicious, chocochewy!
review/text: My husband is a big chocolate fan and he loves his cookies.  I like choclate chip cookies with white chocolate in them, so these sweet and chewy cookies are a nice compromise.  I like the crunch, he loves the fudgy center, that, when slightly chilled, make the cookies even more delicious.<br /><br />The package arrived rather abused, but that was perhaps because for a week our mail was on hold while we had to evacuate for a wildfire.  These cookies still get crumbly and on a hot day the gooey dough make them even  stick together like one sculptured chocolate piece of art.<br /><br />These are definitely a winner, and any chocolate lover will give these two sticky-gooey thumbs up.

review/summary: Where's the "gooey"?
review/text: I love chocolate, and I love cookies, so I was excited to try these cookies.  I was particularly looking forward to a gooey center filled with fudge, as depicted by the large picture on the package.  I was disappointed.  There is a thin, disc-shaped chocolate-colored center in these cookies, but it is certainly not gooey.  Really, it's more like putty, and it doesn't have any discernable chocolate flavor.  The rest of the cookie is chalky in texture and also has no recognizable chocolate flavor.  I did a blind taste test between this chocolate variety and the regular chocolate-chip variety of this new "gooey" cookie, and I could not distinguish a difference.  The only difference is the dark brown color of the cookie.  Personally, I prefer the regular, old fashioned Chips Ahoy cookies over this new gooey version.

review/summary: Neat packaging, marginal taste.
review/text: My first impression of the taste of these cookies was that it wasn't what I expected. I expected a definitive chocolate taste, but it wasn't that. It wasn't bad, but it was different enough that I wasn't sure I liked it. The next bite was better, and the third was pleasing enough that I found myself eating a couple cookies before I stopped.<br /><br />That said, the taste leaves something to be desired. It has a bit of a manufactured flavor. If given the choice between three of these or one homemade cookie, I'd still go for homemade. My four-year-old daughter wouldn't eat these cookies at all--which is saying something, because she normally loves chocolate.<br /><br />The positives about this cookie are the texture (soft as advertised), the fudge filling, and the packaging. The packaging deserves a special note as it is a neat design, I think. Easy to reseal with little mess. And it does keep the cookies soft.<br /><br />The negative is the taste. Passable, palatable, but still a far cry from homemade.

review/text: As a big fan of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies, both the original and the chewy, I was prepared to love these as well. Now, like most people, I'm also pretty enthusiastic about chocolate, and theoretically, there is simply no such thing as "too much." But it just didn't taste right here. It seemed like there was both too much chocolate, and like the existing chocolate was too processed. Overall, it was a rather disappointing experience. I won't be buying these anytime soon.

review/summary: Tasted flat and overprocessed (and 75 calories each)
review/text: Being a fan of all things chocolate, I was looking forward to trying these new Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies! However, they have been a major disappointment. I have tried them at different days and different times, before and after meals, and as snacks, and every time I had the same reaction: a flat and over-processed (if not borderline unnatural) taste. On top of that, each cookie is 75 calories. These are small cookies, around 2-inches diameter each.<br /><br />The package is resealed at the top, with no extra material to throw away. Each package contains 18 cookies, in three rows of six cookies each.<br /><br />It's one thing to take the calorie hit for something really yummy, it's another to take a calorie hit for something that doesn't even taste good!

review/summary: Chewy Gooey Megafudge
review/text: The white chocolate chips add an extra dimension that takes this cookie to another level!  The chocolate cookie taste is good, the creamy center has a great texture and flavor, and I didn't feel these were to cloyingly sweet as some creamy cookies tend to be.  In fact, the cookie portion itself was a bit crumbly, but it wasn't a turnoff.<br /><br />The cream did have a slight odd crunch to it, which I'm assuming was the edible barrier to keep the creme from soaking into the cookie (I have noticed this same odd crunch in other creme-filled snacks as of late, which makes me think it's a normal manufacturing technique).<br /><br />Serving Size: 2 cookies<br />Per serving: 150 calories, 7g fat (3.5g saturated), 0g cholesterol, 110mg sodium, 80mg potassium,  21g carbs (13g sugar, >1g fiber), 1g protein<br /><br />Overall, these are fairly decent for a storebought packaged cookie.  I don't usually buy storebought cookies, actually, we prefer homemade, but everyone in my house enjoyed these!  I don't usually like regular Chips Ahoy at all, I don't enjoy the flavor or the very crunchy texture.  But these Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are much better, and have changed my opinion of the brand.

review/summary: Edible, But Nothing To Get Excited About
review/text: I got to try both the Megafudge and Chocofudge version of this Chips Ahoy offering, and of the two, the Megafudge is better.  The white chocolate chunks almost cut the too-sweetness of the cookies so they're tolerable, but they're still too much sweetness in one little cookie.  Plus, these don't travel/ship any better than the Megafudge version does.  My package looked like most of the cookies inside went a round with a rock tumbler and were all broken up, if not crumbed completely.  That's not why I'm giving one grudging star to this product.  It's because for anyone over the age of eleven, these things are going to put you into sugar shock, and they don't even taste good enough to be worth it.  They have an odd Play-Doh-but-sweet taste.  The texture is sort of chewy, but I failed to recognize "gooey" in these cookies- maybe on a hot day, or if they spent a few seconds in the microwave.  But they're just not worth the effort.  If you have to go to such great lengths to make a sub-mediocre packaged cookie palatable enough to eat, you could have baked yourself up some slice'n'bakes at the very least, and had something that better approximates a real cookie, with real fresh-from-the-oven chewiness and adequate gooiness. Skip these!

review/text: Your kids will be happy to eat these, but of course, they aren't exactly the most discerning eaters.  Calling them "megafudge" is sort of a joke.  They taste like mediocre chocolate, without much fudge, and the supposedly soft center is small enough to be barely noticeable.  The small size of the cookies makes portion control easy, which is probably important to you, and when you sneak a cookie for yourself, you won't get a tooth-breaking biscuit.  Amazingly, the resealable packaging actually works.  Again, though, kids will eat almost anything with enough sugar, so there is no need for high expectations with a product like this.

review/text: I had high hopes for these Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies. What could be better than soft chocolate cookies filled with white chocolate chips and a fudge center? Turns out, a lot of things! These cookies are quite gooey, as promised (the fudge center is soft and reminds me a bit of chocolate frosting), and they have a very strong chocolaty flavor (good, since they're supposed to be fudgy). However, they also have a strong processed flavor. They remind me of the Grandma's brand cookies you find in a vending machine except on a much smaller scale. (Some people will really appreciate this, but I always thought Grandma's cookies tasted way too processed. I guess I'm a homemade cookie snob!)<br /><br />I'd say stick to regular Chips Ahoy and get your soft chocolate cookies somewhere else!

review/summary: Did they make a deal with the milk producers?
review/text: Where to begin...<br /><br />Ok, anytime food shows up as something I could request, try out, and review, I'm likely to jump on the opportunity.  Seriously, do I look stupid?!  Free food?!  What's not to like?!<br /><br />Well, I guess I shouldn't be quite so quick to ask that last question.<br /><br />Ah, now, let me slow down here a bit.  These aren't bad cookies, but they also weren't quite as good as I hoped.<br /><br />First up, I claim a little creative embellishment must be happening with the marketing folks and the pictures on the package.  "Mega fudgy" centers?!  Yeah there's some noticable amount there, but gooey? Not so much.  More like noticably softer and more fudge like than the cookie which encases it, but not melty and gooey like shown on the package.<br /><br />Second, the cookies themselves were fairly dry.  That could be a fault of the shipping, but I really don't think so, despite the warmer weather I'd been experiencing in my area.  It hadn't been that warm, and if the package was as well sealed (factory sealed) as it should have been, it shouldn't have succumb to the weather that easily.<br /><br />Third on my list the packaging -- not the marketing photos on the package, but the "resealable" package, bleh!  I liked the older style resealable packages that folded over and had folding tabs to reseal the packages.  The new "peel back" the package stuff doesn't seem nearly as trustworthy as the older style packages were and in reality seemed to be designed to make me just rip the package open.  Heaven's forbid any of the females in the household (or soon to be in the household as a change of life situation is pending for me, with a fiance that brings a daughter in tow along with her, to join myself and my live-in daughter in the house) be experiencing ones of those demanding times when chocolate is absolutely necessary.  If that were to happen I could see this packaging being easily ripped open completely in favor of getting quick access to the chocolate treasures inside.<br /><br />So, I've gotta ding the product on the packaging, the overly optimistic marketing photos and the dryness of the actual cookies and instead of being well above the medium level, well, this one settles back into mediocre territory.

review/text: We received these delicious cookies in the mail and were pleased with the packaging and freshness of the product. Easy to open package, the cookies were setting carefully inside compartments to avoid excessive bumps with other cookies. Containing blended pieces of chocolate chips, the chocolate dough was well flavored, and the cookies were chewy, easy on the teeth, and quite tasty. Just a nice chocolatey experience for all ages.<br /><br />Aside from a little bit of a strong aftertaste, the flavor was solid and appealing. The aftertaste was less pleasant and reminded me a little of generic, artificial flavoring used in most processed foods of today. Although not excessive, there were many crumbs left from the cookies and each one needed gentle handling to avoid falling apart. This quality likely allows for the soft, chewy feeling but has the potential to be a crumbly mess if the eater is not careful.<br /><br />Good price, good eating, and lots of fun, this is highly recommended for a quick, comfortable dessert. Maybe the overall flavor and approach is more appealing to a younger generation than older although the soft idea is appropriate for all ages. Yet anyone seeking a chocolate cookie, will be pleased with the result as the cookie practically melts with chocolate joy in the mouth.

review/summary: Alright, Not as Gooey as Expected
review/text: I'd like to note that this is the first time I have ever ordered food over the internet.  The cookies arrived undamaged and healthy (as far as I could tell), but seeing as they're just cookies (cookies with many preservatives in them) its probably one of the easiest foods to ship.<br /><br />-<br /><br />The gooey megafudge cookies were tasty, but there was a lot less fudge inside than I expected, and it wasn't as 'gooey' as expected.  It was a bit more solid ... you could definitely tell the difference between the cookie and the fudge, but don't expect it to ooze everywhere.  This could be because the cookies were shipped and thus were not as fresh as normal, I'm not sure.<br /><br />Overall they're OK cookies.  While it is impressive that Nabisco got a "gooey" center in there the cookies themselves were a bit dry and not especially tasty.  They certainly weren't bad, but if you need a quick cookie fix you should probably look elsewhere unless you must have a "gooey" center.  I didn't try dunking them in milk, that may have helped a bit ... it usually does.  But, if a cookie needs to be dunked for optimal taste it hasn't really succeeded as a cookie in my book.

review/summary: Chocolatey, fudgy, chewy GOODNESS
review/text: These cookies were a huge hit in our house. I normally avoid fudge filled or coated cookies because I find them too sweet. These new Chips Ahoy Gooey megafudge cookies are so good I could not resist. They ARE very sweet, but it's that lucious, need to have another one, who cares about that diet! sweetness. These are soft and not in the least bit crunchy and they have what I think are white chocolate slivers in them along with a layer of fudge inside. We'll totally look for these at the grocery store in the future!

review/summary: Dry & Artificial
review/text: Roughly 18 cookies are contained in the 10 ounce package. Each cookie has 75 calories and 6.5g of sugar. These are fairly small cookies, each about the size of a Fig Newton, although round. The appearance of the cookie is chocolate with white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate bits mixed in. Consistency is soft with occasional hard bits. My expectation from a "Chewy Gooey" cookie was for a moist shell surrounding truffle-like inner content. In some ways, given the appearance, I expected the cookie to taste like a soft version of an Oreo's exterior. But the actual cookie is somewhat dry, and while the small center is soft, I would not go so far as to describe it as Gooey.<br /><br />The package also describes the cookie as megafudge, but the taste was more artificial than I would expect from the description. Oddly, it was more artificial than I would expect given the ingredients (which include cocoa). So we've got a cookie which is less moist than one would desire and which tastes mildly artificial. The artificial taste is not bad, but is more Pillsbury Chocolate Space Food Stick than, say, an Oreo, which actually does taste like it has cocoa but which has artificial flavor.<br /><br />By this point, I'm sure you're wondering whether I'm the right person to be reviewing a cookie. I do, in fact, like cookies. I even like ordinary Chips Ahoy cookies and have a particular fondness for fresh Toll House cookies right out of the oven. These cookies, however, let me down. Family members concurred.

review/summary: Dark, delicious
review/text: These rich cookies are dark chocolate, lightly filled with  a soft bite of chocolate, and interlaced with some white bits.  They are very tasty, and of a neat, small, non-crumbling size that would be good on a cookie tray for an event such as a shower, reception, etc., besides being fine for general-purpose cookie nibbling.

review/summary: Health food? No. Good? Yes.
review/text: Even though these soft, fudge-filled cookies verge on overkill (nothing wrong with good ol' standard Chips Ahoy), I like them a lot. I wouldn't recommend eating half a package at once, but if you are able to limit yourself to two cookies they aren't going to cause too much harm. Well, stay away from them if you are dieting I guess.<br /><br />They aren't that 'chewy' as the product name indicates. They are soft, somewhat crumbly chocolate-chocolate chip cookies. It's easy to over-indulge because you can easily pop a whole cookie in your mouth at once. So it's probably best not to go overboard. The 'gooey' part has to do with the chocolatey filling - there is a thin layer in the cookie.<br /><br />The package is kind of nice, with an easily resealable top that pulls open.

review/summary: passable, but not preferable
review/text: These cookies are just okay. They are soft-textured, and kids might enjoy them. They are not "megafudge" by any means. People who love chocolate would not like the artificial chocolate taste of the cookie or the filling. After having sampled this product, I would not purchase it at a store.

review/summary: Yummy !
review/text: The soft Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies arrived today and were treated to a three person review;<br />  * Our six year old grandson,who is a very picky eater, quickly ate his and when asked said it was good...3 out of 5 stars...but too chocolately.<br /><br />  * My husband,who loves chocolate, ate one and said, "If you added a second one it would become a very yummy fudgey brownie....and if you added a third it would be even better". Unfortunately the third one made it a way too sugary experience, but knowing 2 at a time is his limit, he is more than willing to go buy some more at the store (and he only rarely buys store bought cookies). He gives these a 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />  * I,who am on a diet and hardly ever eat cookies, found the two I ate yummy, but not chewy. I liked the combination of all the different chocolates - white, fudge, semi sweet. They are just the right size for 1 or 2 cookies at a time and 3 is too, too much! They are a soft cookie and I really prefer a crunchy cookie over a soft oneso I will give them 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49QU2">Chips Ahoy!

review/text: I have had the regular chewy cookies before and enjoyed those.  My husband loves them and had not seen this type in the store before.  I must say that I did enjoy the brownie like cookie with fudge center.  These cookies are almost to soft to a fault.  They break very easily but are very soft, not brittle.  I enjoyed this wonderful soft cookie.  This cookie will be a snack for the long haul at my house.  My boys, husband, and I loved them.  When school starts in the fall..this will be a lunch desert for sure!  I also liked the white chocolate chips added to the cookie!

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: These cookies are very soft, chewable, and delicious! The only problem I had with them is that each cookie is pretty tiny, so I kept eating them. And that means the calories add up in a hurry, as only two of these are 150 calories with 7 grams of fat.  There's almost no way to eat only two.  I don't know if they're quite "gooey" as the label claims, but they are quite good.

review/summary: Good Cookie
review/text: The Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge Cookie is a good attempt at a cookie. The only thing I would change is leave out the white chocolate chips as they taste chaulky, and do not add anything to the taste of the cookie. The fudge is a nice touch and the taste of the rest of the cookie is just fine.

review/summary: Good but too sweet for my taste
review/text: I love almost anything chocolate.  But these were a bit too sugary for me.<br /><br />First, the packaging is really neat.  You can open the package and peel back the cover as far as you need to get to the cookies.  Then you simply reseal the package and it keeps the cookies fresh.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed with the taste.  They are soft-baked and do have an ample amount of chocolate chips and white chocolate chips in each cookie.  But the taste of sugar is a bit too strong for my taste.  As has been noted, the cookies are very high in calories - 150 for two cookies.<br /><br />Also the cookies were smaller than I had expected.<br /><br />It is extremely difficult to review food products because taste vary so much by individual.  You may love them.  I found them acceptable but not outstanding.  It all depends on your particular taste.  For me they were a bit too sweet and they are certainly very high in calories.

review/summary: Wow.
review/text: Wow--these new Chips Ahoy cookies are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  When they say "Megafudge" on the outside of the package, they aren't kidding.  It's a burst of deep, dark chocolate flavor in every soft, chewy bite.  I wouldn't say they're "gooey;" that's probably more of a marketing tactic, but they are definitely soft and chewy.  They remind me of the old Archway dutch chocolate cookies but with more chocolate flavor and moistness.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend them if you're looking for something sweet and chocolate-y.  It was difficult to stop at eating just one.  So I stopped with two.

review/summary: I really enjoy these
review/text: I wouldn't call the middle "gooey". I would say it is "creamy". I really liked this dark version. It does not seem as sweet as the regular chocolate chip with a "gooey" middle. The chocolate cookie balances out the sweetness. They were what I would call "fudgey" in flavor and texture. The only "odd" thing I noticed about these is that there is a wafer-like texture in the middle of the cookie (beneath the cookie covering and on top of the creamy center). It was a little strange at first, but then I adjusted.<br /><br />My kids liked these a little better than the other version (regular chocolate chip) of this cookie, but all in all this is not their favorite Chips Ahoy cookie. They preferred the traditional cookie. They did not like the flavor or the texture of these. I'm sure some kids will love them, mine did not.

review/text: First I have read concerns about shipping cookies. I will start with saying that the packages of cookies arrived intact. Now on to the cookies themselves, they are not very good tasting cookies. These taste like synthetic chocolate fudge chip cookies that left a linger aftertaste that was not pleasant. I do not know how Nabisco would place their "Chips Ahoy" brand name on these. I do not buy this sort of snack because I am watching calories, but each cookie is seventy-five calories. A positive note is that they have packaged these cookies in their new self sealing packaging. I do not recommend these.

review/summary: Pretty good, but the new Chocofudge is better
review/text: Chips Ahoy! is probably the best-selling chocolate chip cookie in the United States, and I have always thought it was one of the worst.  I've never been a fan of hard chocolate chip cookies and Chips Ahoy! was always the cookie of last resort for me.  Now, though, Chips Ahoy! has launched two new soft chocolate chip cookies:  the one under review here (Megafudge) and Chocofudge.  I think they are both pretty good, but I think the Chocofudge is better.  The Megafudge, as the name implies, is basically white and dark chocolate chips in a chocolate fudge cookie.  It's not bad, but a little too much chocolate for my taste.  So, if you are thinking of trying one of these Chips Ahoy! cookies, you shouldn't be too disappointed with either one, but I would go with the Chocofudge.  Actually, of the mass produced chocolate chip cookies, I like the Pepperidge Farms soft baked Nantucket chocolate chip cookie best.

review/summary: Surprisingly bland
review/text: These cookies are only OK. The texture is fine, but the flavor is quite bland, not nearly as chocolatey as I expected given that the cookie itself is chocolate as well as the filling. Despite the name, the filling is not particularly gooey, but I don't consider that to be a drawback. As noted on the package, these cookies are soft - very soft. Often, I find that soft cookies tend to stick together in the package, then break apart when you try to separate them. These cookies, however, did hold together fairly well.<br /><br />The cookies come in the resealable package, which I like very much.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't buy these cookies in the store because the flavor was so bland.

review/summary: Not Worth the Calories
review/text: The Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are a huge disappointment as a new product offering from Nabisco.  The cookies have an awful fake chocolate flavor, and the they are chalky tasting and dry.  There was nothing gooey about the center of the cookie.  It was more of the same dry, grainy taste as the "cookie" part.  And at 150 calories for 2 cookies (which are less than 2 inches in diameter) they are not worth eating.  They have 7 grams of fat in two small cookies, of which 3.5 is saturated fat, coming from coconut and palm oils.<br /><br />I will however, give credit to Nabisco for two things.  They did load the cookies with a lot of white chocolate chips so they certainly did not skimp on that ingredient, and the resealable package is a great idea.  The opening for the package pulls apart from the top, and there is a sticky type substance that hold the wrapper in place once you reseal it.  I would not consider it air tight, but it certainly makes a good seal for the package.  I can not recommend these cookies based on the taste, texture, and high caloric intake per small serving size.  I will not be buying these cookies again.
