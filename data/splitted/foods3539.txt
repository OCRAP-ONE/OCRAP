review/summary: Didn't find it all that jazzy.
review/text: I have to admit that when I first tried this one I wasn't crazy about it.  It seemed lacking in flavor and richness to me compared to Green Mountain French Roast decaff, which is my favorite.  I have had several cups of it now and am figuring out how to brew it for my taste.  I brew it on the 10 ounce size cup and then add a little cream and sugar and it's perfect.  Not terribly complex in structure, but not bad, just a different, lighter variety.  I have tried brewing it on the smaller cup serving, and it didn't seem to make a difference in taste or fullness so I think I will just keep this one for what it is....a reliable, lighter variety for days when I feel like it.  Worth keeping.

review/summary: Fantastic Decaf
review/text: I'm incredibly picky about my coffee and have been making my own lattes and cappuccino's for years.  When I had to give up caffeine temporarily, I was thrilled to find this decaf - one that isn't lacking in body or flavor (no winey, raisiny, watery coffee for me, please).  Now that I'm consuming caffeine again...this decaf has stayed on auto-deliver.  It's THAT good.  And for the record, I've tried all of the top rated decaf K-cups here and this one has beat them hands down (even the Dark Magic, which I had high expectations of!).

review/summary: THE best decaf!
review/text: The stigma of decafs, in general, has vanished! Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf is, by far, the richest and finest brew around. It is not "almost" coffee. It IS coffee, with more jazz and less BAM! Having to take medication at night I have found the perfect decaf companion. I have served it to many people who say it is the best coffee they have drunk. Sure, they were impressed by the Keuring machine... but the coffee stole the show. And the guests had no idea they were drinking decaf. It just doesn't get any better...

review/summary: Flavor Great but Partial Cup
review/text: Bought this because I like strong full bodied coffee.  Flavor is great and a bit more body that Timothy's Columbia Decaf.  Problem I have is that when I brew this Emeril K-cup I only ever get a partial cup and it brews extremely slow.  I can then pop in a Timothy's or Coffee People's Organic bold and I get full cups which brew at regular strength.  The partial cup and dribble brewing ONLY happens with the Emeril.  Not sure why.  I thought maybe they used a different density filter or something to have it brewing slower to get more brew time.  However, after many attempts with same result I don't that that's it.  Perhaps a defective lot of K-cups.  The brewer has been descaled recently so that's not the problem either.

review/text: Emeril's Jazzed up Decaf is a great flavored decaf..the only problem is it takes forever for it to brew.  For some reason the water just trickles out and takes at least twice as long (maybe more) as other K-Cups to brew.

review/summary: BLOCKED K-CUP
review/text: We really like our Keurig Brewer but recently we've encountered an intermittent problem of generating enough hot water through the K-Cup to get a decent cup of coffee.  We discovered that the brewer worked correctly, but for some reason, about half the Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf K-Cups did not let the water through. Something in the module was blocking free-flow of hot water.  The result was a K-Cup full of water and coffee grounds on the Keurig Brewer. When it works--and lately it's been a crap shoot--the coffee would rate five stars; but, given the frustration of getting a good cup each time, I rate it at three stars.

review/text: Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf is awesome. I have found very few decaf K-cups to even try. I've tried Timothy's Colombian Decaf and Green Mountain Decaf & French Roast Decaf. Emeril's beats them all. It has a nice strong flavor; but no bitterness. Very enjoyable cup of coffee for after dinner for those sensitive to caffeine at night. I highly recommend it if you're a decaf drinker.

review/text: Emeril's K-cups, Jazzed Up Decaf and Timothy's Decaf Rainforest Espresso Extra-Bold show that great coffee can be made from decaf K-Cups.  Both are rich and full bodied with ample taste and aroma.  I'm not sure which I like better at this point but you can't go wrong with either if you drink decaf.  Actually, it would be difficult to to know you are drinking decaf unless you looked at the K-Cup.  Moreover, there is no buzz with this decaf, unlike some other decaf coffees which still have a lot of caffeine.

I have been getting the variety packs of decaf just because I like having a choice.  They were out of the variety packs when I went to order more and I thought I would try the Jazzed Up Decaf.  Man, am I glad.  I am hooked.  It is rich and full bodied and I love it.  I am leaving the 5 or 6 K-cups of the variety packs I had left for anyone who drops by.  Like I said they are good but this stuff is great.  Give it a try.

review/summary: Nothing like Big Easy Bold
review/text: Apparently alot of folks like this product, but I have to say... its terrible.  I tend to drink dark roasts, and have been on a search for a good decaf Kcup for a while now.  I have to admit I have found very few decafs that are drinkable (coffee people's decaf French Roast is pretty good, and Timothy's decaf espresso is drinkable).  Since I thought Emeril's Big Easy bold was surprisingly decent, I thought this would be a decaf version- but its not even close.  Maybe its me, but I've sampled a half dozen decaf dark roasts, and this one is the worst of the bunch.  During brewing it starts off dark, but quickly becomes watery, lacking body.  The resulting drink tastes to me like someone ran the water trough the coffee twice, and I'm drinking the second cup.

review/summary: Coffee Pods Do Not Work
review/text: Purchased two boxes of these coffee pods and have used 10 of the 48.  The pods do not work correctly in my Keurig.  The machine sounds and acts differently with these pods and produces one half of the normal coffee size.  When reusing the pod the second time, even less volume.  The Coffee tastes OK but something is wrong with the pods.  Never had this problem with Green Mountain Coffee pods or other brands.

review/summary: Did I get the same coffee?
review/text: Maybe I received the expired batch from five years ago, but this stuff is tasteless. It takes two K-cups to make a normal strength cup of decaf. I wonder if Emeril samples the products that bear his name? I will avoid his picture from now on! Timothy's decaf is just great- I'll stick with that I guess.

review/summary: Excellent, Flavorful Coffee!
review/text: We've had a Keurig Coffee maker in our office for a couple of years now and I've enjoyed it immensely. I've probably tried every offering that has been available in the office, including regular caffeinated coffees. By far the most flavorful is Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf. While I do tend to favor decaf, this one stands out to me among them all. One of the favorites in the office is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso which is good in it's own right, however, after we ran out of Emeril's I was forced to brew myself a cup of Rainforest and was left disappointed in the taste department. Other reviewers may call the taste burnt, but to my palate it is robust, flavorful and thoroughly enjoyable coffee.

review/summary: Jazz up the decaf
review/text: The first time I heard about decaf (on a sitcom), I assumed it was a joke. Yet, those bottled laughs weren't heard in the background. Could it be...? An American teacher later informed me that yes, there really is such a thing.<br /><br />Decaf must be the most stupid invention in world history. I mean, coffee without caffeine?! That's rather like coke without cocaine. Or tobacco without nicotine. Or the Democratic Party without Bill Clinton.<br /><br />It lacks the active substance.

review/text: We have a Keurig coffee brewer and are always on the look out for strong but not bitter coffee.  The Emeril Jazzed Up Decaf fits the bill.  It is strong but without that bitter aftertaste that sometimes gets confused with "strong."  You would not know that you are drinking decaf coffee.  We have tried other Emeril K-cups and have been please with them as well.

review/summary: Tried most - this is best
review/text: Well, we got a Keurig machine last year.  Almost all of the coffee samples that came with it were too watered down tasting for my wife and me.  So we started to experiment.  I'd say we have tried about 85-90% of the available decaf offerings.  This Jazzed Up version has been, by far, the best yet.  It has even allowed me to appreciate the Keurig again. My wife - not a decaf drinker - has even switched to this.  She's a bit particular and likes the store bought, caffeinated Sumatra coffee. I was going to try the extra bold Rainforest Espresso next, based on the reviews here.  I was about to order the Rainforest product but the rich, bold coffee taste of Emeril's Jazzed Up convinced me to go with it again.  Now my wife can drink coffee in the evening and not worry about it affecting her sleep.  I'll get the Rainforest Espresso next time and add a comparison here.  The Espresso will have to be very good to get us away from this one though. I do hear that the two are comparable - we'll see.  You can use the larger setting on the machine and fill a mug without sacrificing taste.  It's just a great cup of coffee, even for decaf.  I'm off to have another.<br />___________________<br /><br />I did purchase, and have tried the Rainforest Espresso since the above post.  I'm sticking with Emeril's Jazzed Up decaf coffee for my k-cup selection.  While still a good cup of coffee, the Espresso lacks the smoothness I feel we get from the Jazzed up coffee.  I'm not sorry I had two boxes of the Espresso as this was a very acceptable alternative to Emeril's product, but I don't believe I'll be ordering it again.  IMHO, the Rainforest Espresso is just a small notch, or two, below the Jazzed Up coffee for the smooth and robust flavor of Emeril's Jazzed Up k cup coffee.

review/text: This is a decaf for people who like a "real" cup of coffee.  It is strong and full of coffee flavor.  Most decafs we've tried are kind of weak.  I would give it 5 stars, but sometimes I do get an odd aftertaste that I associate with decafs.  I don't taste it every time, so I wonder if it's because the K-cups get old?  We don't go through the decafs as fast as the regular.<br /><br />For those of you that know New Orleans coffee (with chicory), this is different.  No chicory, just good coffee.

review/text: This coffee doesn't taste like decaf coffee.  And that is very unusual.  I found that if I use the 9.25 oz setting on our coffee maker it gives us about the strength one might get at most restaurants, but it tastes better.  If you can't live without the Charbucks burnt style of flavor, you might try the 5.25 oz setting.  If you like  amilder cup, use the 11.25 oz setting.  This is now what I drink after I have had enough caffeine for the day.

However, you must love bold coffee.  This is not for coffee whimps.  I did not find it bitter or burned-tasting, as I have read in other reviews.  Brew the smallest Keurig size, top it with foamed milk or cream, and sprinkle with cocoa or cinnamon, and you have a fab cappucino.  (Buy one of those great little milk foamer wands at Amazon!)

It's safer for me to do decaf, but sometimes even that can be a problem for pathetic ol' me.<br />But I've found the decaf that makes me happy when I do drink it and this is it. The flavor is potent and smokey but not acidic. I think this is a difficult balance to strike but here it is. I especially like sweetening it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UVK9CI">Madhava Pure Organic Agave Nectar, Vanilla Flavor, 11.75-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)</a>. This time of year I enjoy it iced, using reusable ice cubes like these<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C54DVO">White Ice (TM) Reusable Ice Cubes for your Drinks</a> so that it doesn't water my coffee down (by the way, reusable ice cubes are fantastic in the summer to keep very chilled the things you won't put ice cubes in like beer or milk).<br />Hopefully my husband will consume the other decaf k-cups we have left, because I'm not drinking anything but the Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf from here on in.

review/text: I typically only like to drink Timothy's and Emeril's coffees.  I like coffee strong, without bitter aftertaste.  For a decaf, this is great coffee.  It's not as bold as Timothy's Midnight Magic or Rainforest Espresso (my 2 favorite caffeinated coffees), but for an afternoon or evening coffee that won't keep you up all night, its great.  Only downside is that I think it has more caffeine than other weak decaf coffees.  I like it, but it does affect sleep.  On a positive, if you have it in the afternoon/evening, it might give a LITTLE bit of a much needed pick-up, without getting you overcaffienated as can happen if you have too much regular coffee!

review/text: This is an excellent and bold decaf.  The flavor really reminds me of Cafe du Monde's coffee in New Orleans' French Marketplace!  It also tastes very nice and bold on the 12 oz. cup Keurig setting!

I like a stronger cup of coffee that doesn't remind me it's decaf, and this is it!  Don't hesitate to try.  This one will be shipping regularly to my home.

review/summary: Emeril's Coffees have burnt flavor
review/text: Emeril's coffees have a burnt flavor.  It is good strong coffee and would have been very good but the burnt flavor ruins any enjoyment.  The bold roast gives it the burnt flavor.  Don't confuse bold roast with strong coffee.  My husband loves very strong coffee and even he could not drink this.  Disappointed.

review/summary: The end of a long search for great decaf
review/text: After buying my Keurig (Signature model with the expanded water reservoir), I tried several different decaf options in search of a decaf with real flavor.<br /><br />To be honest, my favorite doesn't come in Keurig format - Trader Joe's French Roast decaf. So I was searching for something close, since using the do-it-yourself K-cup accessory results in too much cleaning for where my Keurig is located: in my cube at work.<br /><br />So I tried: Donut Hole Decaf - meh<br />  Newman's Own Decaf - much better, but still a lighter roast than I wanted<br />  San Francisco Bay French Roast Decaf - was so bad I got a refund from Amazon (thank you!)<br />  Tully's Decaf - very good, but not quite it<br />  Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf - excellent<br /><br />and finally...<br />  Emeril's Jazzed-Up Decaf - outstanding!!<br /><br />I drink mine black, and want to taste the flavor resulting from the roast. Emeril's has a rich set of flavors typical of a great French Roast, and smells fantastic. Most people that smell it can't believe it's decaf.<br /><br />A simply wonderful product. My hat's off, Emeril!

review/summary: Weak
review/text: I expected a better product because it's Emeril and since its called jazzed up I thought it would be strong. Not the case at all. Its just plain old decaf coffee. Nothing special about it. Its weak and not jazzed up at all. Since Emeril is located in New Orleans, I thought maybe it would include chicory or something from that area that would make it a better coffee but that's not the case.  If you want a dissappointment try it. If you like weak coffee try it. But, otherwise, keep walking.

review/text: Got these decaf K-Cups for my boss and he enjoys the coffee very much. My sole driving factor was price. I figured even if the coffee wasn't so great it wouldn't be too bad because we didn't pay >$1 per K-Cup like the grocery stores want you to. We were pleasantly surprised to find this coffee delicious and the aroma that fills the office is refreshing. Kudos!

review/text: This Emeril's Jazzed up Decaf taste very good.  My only reticence is that I'm wondering if it has some caffeine in it.  When I have caffeine, I get a sort of a increased blood pressure buzz.  I had that type of buzz after having this coffee.  My wife had the type of feeling in her stomach that she gets when she has caffeine.  I have no way to test the ingredients to be sure.  But I wonder if this coffee is so "jazzed up" that it has a little caffeine.  It would be interesting to see what other people's experience is.<br /><br />UPDATE: - I've now tried this coffee a dozen times...I think it is safe to say that it has no caffeine.  I haven't had the "buzz" I described above.  But the coffee sure does taste good, so I increased my rating to 5 stars.

review/summary: Love the taste...........
review/text: My husband wanted this coffee maker, not me. I thought it was too expensive (still do) and the coffee was too expensive (still do). We bought the Newman's decaf and really liked it, when we were in a hurry the coffee maker is great. I decided to give another decaf a try and tried Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf. It is a great coffee, no after taste and a good rich coffee. My son who drinks only reg. coffee does not know the difference with Emeril's. It's still over priced but it's good. I am not a big coffee drinker, one cup in the morning is about it but I like this one.

review/summary: An off batch of K-Cups
review/text: I have been buying Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf Coffee Keurig K-Cups for several months, and I've always liked it. Unfortunately, the batch I most recently received, with a use-by date of April 24/2012, seems to have about half the usual amount of coffee in the cups. The result is coffee that is weak and watery, unless I set the coffee maker on the smallest cup (espresso size).
