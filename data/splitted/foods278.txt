review/summary: The best EVOO this side of the Atlantic!
review/text: In Italy, I am fortunate enough to pick up homemade unbranded EVOO. Outside of Italy, this is the best EVOO. I can't believe how delightful it is. Sometimes, I get the urge to drink it. It is really that good. I wouldn't use this to cook unless it is part of the sauce. I often use it in salads, breads, light pastas. This makes my pesto stand apart from the rest. I can't say enough about this EVOO. It is so good. For those familiar, the flavor resembles the type of oils from southern Italy or more specifically, Puglia.

review/summary: Tasty Thai Meal To Have In Your Pantry
review/text: My favorite Thai dish to order out is Pad Thai.  When I get a craving, but can't get to a restaurant I will make Taste of Thai Pad Thai for Two.  Usually I do share it with a family member, but if not, the leftovers make a tasty lunch.  The flavor of the sauce is very authentic.  Not too heavy or light-just right.  The amount of rice noodles is substantial.  The package makes a good size meal for two.  I add my own chicken pieces or shrimp along with some green onions, and if I have some broccoli, I'll throw that in as well.  This is a great item to keep in your pantry for when you want something different and exotically tasty.

review/summary: Pad Thai
review/text: The key to any Asian dish is the sauce.  Buying Pad Thai in a box means you're buying the right noodles and an interesting sauce ready to go.  The box includes lots of noodles for two people, but the sauce is not as generous for the amount of noodles, and it's not very interesting.  You also have to add lots of other ingredients to make it resemble real Pad Thai, so it's not much of a time saver.  Still lots of work along with a disappointing taste.

review/summary: Delicious Quick and Easy
review/text: I love the sauce for this product.  I was concerned about the comments of not being enough sauce for the noodles provided but did not find this to be an issue. Adding a bit of soy to the final prepartion stage helped.  I made this with uncooked shrimp and it was delicous.  You do need to be prepared to have on hand what other ingredients you wish to add (including peants) - the box only has noodles and sauce.  I plan to try it with tofu as well.<br /><br />The first time I made this dish I followed the directions and used hot tap water on the noodles and the second time I used some recently boiled water.  The boilded water made the noodles stick together and I had a hard time getting them to separate.  When I used the hot tap water I did not have this problem.  I suggest placing them in the water a bit at a time so the potential sticking won't happen.<br /><br />Plenty of food for two! I will definately buy this again.

review/text: There are PLENTY of rice noodles. The sauce is very skimpy though. I made 2 boxes, used both packs of sauce plus an extra sauce and it still wasn't enough. Not by a long shot. For one box you probably need 2 full packs of sauce. Which means I needed 4.<br /><br />You can add pretty much any veggie to the dish also.<br /><br />Conclusion: Quite tasty but seriously lacking in the amount of sauce.

review/text: This is by far the best Pad Thai I have tried so far, and I have tasted many boxed preparations. I have added shrimp, occasionally chicken but quite frankly, it's good as is.  I sometimes add slivered sweet red pepper for color and, of course, cilantro and lime. The only suggestion I would make is not to use all the rice noodles that come with the meal.  There is really not enough sauce to completely cover the noodles and the sauce is really good.  I use only about 2/3 of the rice noodles and it is still plenty of food for two people.

review/summary: Godo Stuff but Could Use a Bit More Heat
review/text: Just to be clear, this is a starter kit. So you're going to have to add things like an egg, oil, meat, scallions, etc. But it is indeed a pretty good starter kit. I made this with some diced up chicken breast. It was so good that I ate the whole thing. I guess I was hungry. At first, I didn't think it had quite enough flavor, but then I just couldn't stop eating it. So I guess I liked it. I want a bit more flavor though. So next time I might try it with Kung Pao sauce, or something similar. I noticed that you can also buy the noodles by themselves, so you're free to try different recipes.<br /><br />Preparation was easy. You have to put the noodles in hot water to soak for about 25-30 minutes. Then you just take that time to prep the other ingredients and start the cooking process. By the time you get all that done, the noodles are ready to be added to the mix for the final stir-fry process. It smells great while it's cooking so that really gets the appetite worked up. Just remember to use a really big pan or a Wok. By the time you add the noodles, there's a lot of stuff there and it will over-fill a standard large frying pan.

review/summary: Perfectly edible Pad Thai
review/text: Although the preparation instructions could've been a little better (for instance, soaking the rice noodles in hot tap water just wasn't sufficient:  I really needed to do what another brand of Pad Thai for two had suggested, and pour BOILING water over them to ensure that they softened sufficiently to be ready to stir-fry when my wok and vegetables were ready), I was quite satisfied with the quality of Pad Thai I was able to make with this kit, even using canned bean sprouts instead of fresh.<br /><br />I followed the instructions mostly, though I was careful not to overcook the thawed raw shrimp I used for protein and omitted adding chopped peanuts (which I didn't have on hand) at the end.  With an egg, some canned bean sprouts (though fresh are always better if you can get them and use them quickly), and chopped green onions, plus some small shrimp thawed overnight, I was able to turn this into a very satisfying main dish for two.

review/summary: Average taste. Don't expect Authenticity in a box
review/text: I am an avid eater of Thai Food, so I was curious to see how this Pad Thai in a box would taste. Considering the price, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Ease of cooking: 3 stars. It's a tough trick to gauge when the noodles have been soaked long enough to get the perfect firmness. Also, you have to use and wash multiple pots to make this. One pot to boil the water for the noodles. And a frying pan to stir fry the noodles in.<br /><br />Taste: It's in a box. How much can you expect? Albeit, taste might have been better if I added some fresh bean sprouts, basil leaves, and shrimp or chicken.<br /><br />Price: Not bad considering it's a third of what  you would pay for compared to take out.<br /><br />All in all, I give it 3 stars. This is like the cup o noodle of Pad Thai. Decent enough to consume if you really run out of food, but not something you'll be craving during lunch hour.

review/text: There's nothing wrong with this packaged mix, but it's just approximately 8 ounces of rice noodle and an ounce of tamarind sauce;  you must provide all the other ingredients.<br /><br />Rice noodles are cheap, and the sauce is just tamarind paste, sugar, and soy sauce--you can keep a jar of tamarind paste in the fridge for months.  For what this costs, you can get pounds and pounds of rice noodle and several jars of tamarind paste.  Since you have to prepare and add all of the other ingredients anyway, it only takes a couple of minutes to make the sauce, too.

review/text: The noodles take longer then the instructions to cook.  I also recommend using this as a soup instead, so put the noodles in a bowl with water in the microwave, get the water hot and then add the pouch of sauce.  Add some veggies and maybe some soy sauce and then it's actually pretty good.  But if you do it based on the instructions, the noodles won't cook all the way and it's a bit plain.

review/text: To quote my 10 year old daughter when she dove into what she considers her favorite food. "Mom this tastes like NOTHING."<br /><br />This was abysmal. I thought we were taking a short cut. My mistake. Having made pad thai from scratch, I was shocked at how little it tasted like our favorite dish.<br /><br />The sauce had so much sugar in it, that out of the package it tasted more like sweet chilli sauce. As another reviewer said, there wasn't enough of it and the noodles in the finished dish tasted dry and bland... not good.  The only thing I could equate it to was trying to use ketchup as a substitute for Marinara sauce. We will never bother with that again.

I just dont really like it. This sauce uses ALOT of tamarind, you can see the chunks in it. I'm pretty sure that my local Thai restaurant does not use tamarind, their sauce is not as dark brown. (Maybe thats the Americanized Pad Thai?)<br /><br />I found a Pad Thai sauce recipe online and I think I will use instead of this sauce.<br /><br />2 1/2 Tbs. brown sugar<br />1 Tbs. lime juice<br />2 1/2 Tbs.

review/summary: Bad Batch?  Tastes like Nothing
review/text: My husband recently has had to go on a "no salt" diet, and his favorite restaurant is Outback, so I ordered him this steak seasoning.  The first time we used it, we both thought it was very bland - the steaks tasted like they had been cooked with nothing.  We doubled the amount we used the second time, and it was still completely tasteless.  The third time we dipped the steaks in egg and used this seasoning as a breadcrumb-style coating (nothing added to it, just a bowl of this seasoning), and the steaks were STILL completely tasteless.  I threw the rest of the giant tub of colored red flecks in the garbage.  Did I just get a really old batch or what?  What a waste.

review/summary: NECCO bought Clark Bar
review/text: NECCO bought Clark Bar a while ago.  I believe the formulation has changed from the original because I remember the original Clark Bars being better than what NECCO produces, although I still love 'em.<br /><br />from NECCO:<br /><br />[....]<br /><br />By 1920 the D.L. Clark Company was making about 150 different types of candy, including several five-cent bars, specialty items and a bulk candy line. Clark also manufactured chewing gum and in 1921 incorporated the Clark Brothers Chewing Gum Company, makers of Teaberry and Tendermint. However, by 1931, the candy bar business had grown so large that Clark decided to specialize exclusively in candy bars.<br /><br />In 1955, the Clark family sold their candy business to the Beatrice Food Company, which operated the company until 1983.<br /><br />In 1983, Leaf, Inc., which operated 11 candy and gum plants in the United States, acquired the confectionery division of Beatrice foods, including Clark. When Leaf, Inc. announced plans to move the candy operations from Pittsburgh, the city protested. The candy plant and rights to Clark, Slo Poke and Black Cow were sold, and D.L. Clark became part of the Pittsburgh Food and Beverage Company. After a period of financial instability, the company was again sold in June of 1995. The Company was renamed Clark Bar America and distribution was re-established. New product lines were also selectively introduced including Winter Clark, Clark Dark, and the Yoo-hoo Candy Bar.<br /><br />However, Clark Bar America again fell into financial difficulty and in May of 1999, New England Confectionery Company purchased the assets of Clark Bar America.

review/summary: Chipotle Taco Seasoning
review/text: If you are bored with the regular old taco seasoning you find in the gravy aisle - you are in for a pleasant surprise with this seasoning.  For starters, I don't use beef, I use texturized vegetable protein, which, let's face it, needs a little more help than beef to taste good.  This seasoning had multi-layer flavors to it, unlike the taco seasoning stand-bys that taste mainly like chili powder and cayenne pepper.  Flavorful and spicy and not crazy, fire-breathing hot.  The currants or raisins were a little unexpected but incredibly tasty.  However, it is still within the taste  range of taco seasoning so if you are craving tacos - this still satisfies and then some.

The chipotle is the spiciest of the 3 but I really don't think any of them are too spicy. The raisins are good in this one too, though not as noticeable as in the picadillo seasoning.

review/text: I grew up in Texas and I used to make my own taco seasoning. Once I was in a rush and bought this on a whim because the packaging was so appealing. This was so much better than anything I'd made on my own. Now this is all I use. This is great on ground beef, but it would also be good on pork or even vegetarian crumbles or textured vegetable protein. There is a play of sweet/spicy flavors in this seasoning that gives it an incredible depth. A pound of beef with these seasonings makes great tacos, taco salad, empanadas, scrambled eggs, etc.

review/summary: The Best Dern Microwave Popcorn.  Period.
review/text: I grew up in the days before microwave ovens, and I recall eating popcorn that was popped in a wire basket over a fireplace, as well as popped in a "hot air" popper and in all kinds of configurations on the stove-top, including the entertaining "Jiffy-Pop" that started off in an aluminum-foil covered pie pan and ended up fluffing up that aluminum-foil higher than a 1960's bee-hive hairdo.<br /><br />Microwave popcorn has become so adept at using that now-universal kitchen device, I think I'd have a microwave if only for popcorn.<br /><br />That being said - you can SEE that there are scads of competing brands.  Still back before microwaves there were commercials starring Orville Redenbacher, and geeky as that guy seemed, he seemed to know something about popcorn.<br /><br />NOW we have microwaves and, frankly, Orville's off-spring haven't kept up.  "Pop-Secret" just plain pops better - their Popped kernels come out big and fluffy and just about every kernel pops.  I empty the bag and the familiar residue of a teaspoon of unpopped kernels just plain isn't there.<br /><br />THAT would be reason enough to rejoice, but Pop-Secret exceeds my expectations.  Back in the days when we popped our own popcorn by time-consuming laborious processes, the key to enjoying the popcorn was what you did AFTER the popping - just before putting the stuff in your mouth.  Back in those days mom taught us to melt a bit of butter and sprinkle that with just a touch of salt onto our snowy stacks of popped corn.  DEEEEEE-licious.<br /><br />In the years since some palates have been trained to become used to that greasy, sticky, oily stuff that's served in our nation's movie theatres. Okay if that's all you can get.... BUT - why would you want that at HOME?<br /><br />Pop-Secret Homestyle must have picked Momma's brain, because it comes out just like Momma's best - big, fluffy popcorn coated with just a touch of salt and Land-o-Lakes butter.<br /><br />I love popcorn.  The Mrs. makes fun of me for how much I love it, but I think the Mrs. and God understand.  Pop-Secret Homestyle is not only the BEST doggone popcorn you can get, but stick a bag in your microwave, push the "popcorn" button, and a few minutes later you have a little bag of heaven.  Open and enjoy.<br /><br />One piece of advice from an expert: Before putting the bag in the microwave, flatten out the bag - as much as possible flatten out the little kernels - separating them from one another.  This makes for more uniform popping and you get that "no unpopped kernel" experience.

review/summary: disappointed
review/text: I went to the store and noticed that Pop Secret changed the package size in the 6 Pack Homestyle from 3.5 to 3.2 ounces.  Then they say you get more than Orville Redenbocker to try to justify the shrinking package.  So, instead of getting 3.5 ounces as you did before, you're now getting 3.2 ounces and it takes less time to cook.  I don't think this is right, I'm going to have to start shopping around even though I like this popcorn.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P7531S">Pop Secret Homestyle Popcorn, Microwavable Popcorn, 3-Count, 10.5-Ounce Box (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: I'm a huge fan of Pop Secret's Homestyle popcorn! Unlike other buttery popcorns, this one doesn't leave that lovely greasy coating in my mouth. Uh, ewwww. It's a great mix of salt and buttery goodness. My only wish is that it were lower in fat, but oh well, it's so yummy I'll put up with it. :-)

review/summary: The Indian is Dead -- Her Lakes Dry
review/text: This was my favorite popcorn. 5 stars all the way, until... Some bean counter decided butter doesn't need a picture of a squatting Indian. The squatting Indian on the Pop Secret box is gone, and with it the taste of what was hands down the best stuff lining the underside of my couch cushions. With land o' lakes, I could eat a bag. With their new knock-off butter i'm forced to occassionally stop and scrape the gelatenous film from the roof of my mouth. Then I consider the other places that film has to be. Plus, the new stuff tastes like the tongue of an otter mired in oil. Bottom line: bring back the Indian, bring back the good stuff: I could die in her arms tonight.

review/summary: Popcorn -False Descripton
review/text: This was once a delicious popcorn treat.  It is lousy now. What's more, the description shown by Amazon is a lie.<br /><br />It says, "Made with real Land O' lakes Butter".  WRONG! This new stuff has plenty of fat, is very greasy actually, but the grease is "Hydrogenated Soybean Oil". It does not resemble real butter in any way whatsoever. It doesn't smell good and it doesn't taste good.<br /><br />Now I am stuck with 23 packages of this junk because I'm disabled and can't manage sending it back.<br /><br />If you need a popcorn fix, buy something else.

review/text: I usually buy my mate in smaller quantities from a small tea shop.  I drink so much of it, I decided to try to buy some bulk mate to save money.  I am almost finished with the bag already!  This mate is very good for the price.  If you let it steep in the gourd for awhile, it can get pretty strong as well!  Will definitely be buying again, but I may try another variety first.

review/summary: Confusing nutrition label
review/text: I got turned on to Yerba Mate tea by a friend. I decided to order some of my own.  I was happy to receive the product relatively quickly (a little over a week, but it was shipped from Argentina).  I opened the package, and reviewed the nutrition label simply out of habit. I'm a low-carb dieter and it's reflex now to flip a product over and review the nutrition info.  I was shocked to see the label stating that it was 9grams of carbs per serving.  I called a friend of mine, and asked her to look at her tea, and hers said 0 carbs, unless the tea itself was eaten (the leaves and such) and even then, it was 0.2grams per 1/2 cup.  I'm not sure where the carbs in mine were supposed to come from, but the tea I had looked, smelled, and tasted just like my friends, so I threw caution to the wind and have been drinking it.  Tastes great, and has a fresher, greener taste than regular iced teas.  What I'll do is take about 4-5 tablespoons, put them in a big tea bag, and use that amount to make approximately 2 gallons of tea.  I let it boil awhile with the bag in it, and instead of coming out dark brown like regular tea does, it comes out dark green.  It's quite a refreshing change from sun tea and I drink it both hot and cold.

review/text: We don't get to eat cookies very often but when we have company over we bake fresh cookies.  These Betty Crocker's Walnut Chocolate Chip cookies are as good as it gets.  If you follow the directions for making them as it specifies you get a cookie that is every bit as good as any homemade style cookie you can bake.  In about 20 minutes from start to finish you're done and your guests are happy.  You had better make two batches as the life span of these cookies just out of the oven is very short.  They are so good warm you will have trouble getting them to last.<br /><br />They are ideal with milk, coffee or hot tea and nice to munch on while you talk with your company.  These cookies use Diamond Brand walnuts which are the best out there and they just make the flavor perfect.  The perfect treat for any occasion, bake up a batch tonight!<br /><br />PS, my grandson thinks his grandma is the best cook in the world so she doesn't tell him they came out of a package mix.

This is NOTHING like that rather a cut down version of a crunchy candy bar..<br />  1. it is extremely SMALL.. it didn't even fill the modest size package that is was wrapped in. Approx 2/3 of the size of a usual bar<br />  2. it is Thin as well as short...<br />  3. Extremely sweet and modest crunch<br />  4. It might only measure 90 calories but most of those come from simple Sugar- the first 3 ingredients are SUGAR...<br /><br />So if you want a sugar high fine but if your  are looking for a  healthy low cal mid meal snack that is healthy find another bar there are loads of them out there.<br /><br />So inconclusion this is a cut down candy bar faking it as a healthy low calorie item. Kellogg You can do way better than this !!!

review/summary: Pretty good snack
review/text: I tried one of these and thought it was pretty good, but not enough for breakfast for me.  I don't eat a lot at one time, but it wasn't that filling.  Maybe with a piece of fruit and a drink it could be breakfast. (Honestly, I prefer the chocolate peanut butter bars from South Beach Living--awesome).<br /><br />Anyway, this vanilla crisp cereal bar is 90 calories, 2g protein, 10% niacin, thiamin, vitamin B6, and riboflavin (again, compare it to the South Beach Living Peanut Butter Chocolate bar). The vanilla crisp bar is tasty, a little sweet but not too bad, and crunchy like a rice krispy bar. It has a drizzle of what tastes like white icing on top. It's a lot better than many of these bars.<br /><br />If you are eating these as a low-cal snack or to have something in the car to keep your sugar count from blitzing out, then ok, sure.  But if you are doing a diet thing, you need to have a satisfying meal experience. If you feel "cheated" out of breakfast, you are likely to go off your diet.  Most diet gurus tell you to eat 3 - 6 reasonable and satisfying meals a day. And as someone who lost 59 lbs 1-2 years ago, I agree.<br /><br />By the way--bars contain wheat, milk, and soy ingredients. (I know some people are allergic to these ingredients.)

review/text: These are quite tasty if you like sugar or sweets (I do), but they contain partially hydrogenated oil. For taste alone, I would give these 5 stars for people who like sweets. For people who want a healthy snack, I wouldn't recommend these. Overall I am giving it 3 stars because while these may taste good, it's only due to being very sweet due to lots of sugar and corn syrup. Also, while the impression may be that these are good for you being only 90 calories (it's only a .8 ounce bar anyway), I certainly wouldn't say they are. They also contain artificial flavors.

review/summary: A sweet snack, but nothing more.
review/text: These bars taste like rice crispy treats, and are nice if you just need a snack and have nothing healthier to turn to.<br /><br />However, do NOT think that they are "healthy". Though they are low in calories (90) and fat (1.5g), they are also low in protein and high in sugar. Essentially these are little sticks of sugary carbohydrates, with little to no nutritional value. Also, upon reading the ingredients, I discovered that they contain numerous unhealthy ingredients: partially hydrogenated oils, high fructose corn syrup, several chemicals whose names I could not even pronounce, and a preservative called BHT that may or may not be linked to cancer. Not too great for a supposedly "healthy" cereal bar.<br /><br />Long story short, they are great if you are trying to avoid that 300 calorie muffin or a super sugary dessert. However, as a healthy snack, these bars are not much better than eating a slice of sugary-chemical-y bread.

You can also use this product in soups, chili, rice, couscous or your own homemade French dressing.<br />Here is the bread recipe I used.  If you make it and hate it I couldn't even begin to fathom why and I'd be happy to read your comments.<br />Tomato-Cheese Bread<br /><br />1 cup lukewarm water<br />2 1/4 teaspoons yeast<br />1 tablespoon sugar<br />2 1/2 cups (11 1/2 ounces) bread flour, divided<br />1 teaspoon dried oregano<br />1 tablespoon tomato powder<br />1 teaspoon salt<br />1 generous cup (4 ounces) coarsely shredded sharp cheddar cheese<br />2 tablespoons olive oil<br /><br />In the bowl of your stand mixer, combine water, yeast, sugar, and one cup of the bread flour. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside for 30 minutes.<br /><br />Add the remaining flour, oregano, tomato powder, and salt. Knead with the dough hook until the dough cleans the side of the bowl and starts becoming elastic. Add the olive oil and continue kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic and is no longer sticky.<br /><br />Add the cheese and knead just until it is incorporated. You don't want to knead so much that the cheese disintegrates into the bread. It it's a little unevenly distributed, that's fine.<br /><br />Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside to rise until doubled in size, about 60 minutes.<br /><br />Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and sprinkle some cornmeal on a baking sheet.<br />Flour your work surface and knead the dough briefly before you form it into your preferred shape. Put it on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.<br /><br />When the dough has risen, slash it as desired, then bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, until nicely browned.<br /><br />Cool completely on a rack before slicing.

These seed crackers are a delicious part of my vegan diet.  I had originally bought some raw seed crackers made by a company, and the price was outrageous.  3 ounces for $5.  I can make many pounds of seed crackers for about $10 - and that's what I do, and why I use this tomato powder.  One would think this powder could easily be bought at Whole Foods or other grocery stores, but I've never been able to find it, and Amazon is where it's at!  This is not the first time I've purchased it, and it won't be the last.
