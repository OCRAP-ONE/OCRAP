review/summary: Not quite right
review/text: I drank it but it tasted a little bit like baking soda.  Lowfat milk makes it taste flat, empty, like something important is missing.  Just not as exciting as I expected it to be.  I haven't had any other can cold coffee drinks, so I don't know if I just don't care for all of them or whether this one is worse than usual.  I think I'm going to stick with my hot black coffee and when I do doctor it up, its going to be with all the real stuff.

review/text: What a treat.  It is quite sweet but I think well worth the 100 calorie expenditure.  I had mine heated but it would also be good chilled with some whipped cream on top or simply over ice.  The cans have pop tops and are pure aluminum.  I prefer canned beverages  in aluminum because it does not impact the flavor and also because that is the only substance I can recycle in my current situation.  This is my second sample coffee beverage from this company and both have made me say YUM right out loud.

review/text: Not bitter, not to sweet...it was good to try.  I was hoping for more of a "mocha" flavor, but I didn't quite get that.  As far as canned coffee goes, this was okay, but I would rather spend the money and get it from the coffee shop or make my own.

review/summary: Like a fresh cappucino put in a can - nice flavor but texture is lacking
review/text: The illy cappucino has a nice unsweetened flavor.  Of course, the challenge is having the texture of a cappucino in a can, and that challenge has not been mastered.  The texture is a little thin and flat.  The instructions say not to shake the can, which I would have though to help.  Overall, it's a fine substitute for convenience.

review/summary: I really like the chocolate-coffee combination
review/text: But this product had an after taste hard to describe. It was something on the order of a bitter, metallic taste. At first sip, the chocolate taste came through along with the coffee. Then this nasty after taste spoiled it. I regularly buy Wendy's Jamocha shake, add chocolate to my coffee, and like coffee ice cream with chocolate syrup. So its not the basic flavor that seems to be the fault. Possibly something is wrong with the container or the coffee is bitter.

review/summary: Tasty and smooth
review/text: illy espresso was my first "fancy" coffee, and I loved it. So I had high hopes for the issimo Cappucino drink.<br /><br />Most refrigerated coffee drinks (who shall remain nameless **coughfrappucinocough**) are either too sweet or too milky. The first sip of issimo I took had me worried for a second. It's a strong flavor, with more than a hint of sweetness. A moment later I tasted the coffee, and the flavor mellowed. The best part is that the coffee taste is there - not overly bitter, but a good foil for the sweet milk and cocoa.<br /><br />After that first taste, the rest of the can went down smooth and easy, with a clean and refreshing aftertaste.<br /><br />The illy issimo Cappucino coffee drink is mellow and tasty - a great alternative to  most of the refrigerated coffee drinks I've tried. Nothing can live up to my first taste of a hot illy espresso drink, but at least this lives up to the name.

review/text: The Illy Issimo cappuccino coffee drink is a very convenient way to enjoy a cold cappuccino. The 81 milligrams of coffee are about what a Red Bull can would give you, but it tastes like a coffee, not an energy drink. The flavor is excellent, you can taste the coffee and the cream; and it goes down very smoothly. I would definitely have another.

review/summary: Nice Alternative.
review/text: I'm not an avid coffee drinker, but do have the occasional Monster/Rockstar/Starbucks energy coffee type drink.  Pretty rarely, since those tend to screw with my stomach.  I assumed this would be the same sort of thing but I guess the first thing I noticed it is a much milder and smoother version of the aforementioned.  I drank it without feeling that "energy drink jolt" and now tend to think of this as more of an actual coffee drink as opposed to the deceiving "energy drink" type of can.<br /><br />I suppose I'd most compare it to the Starbucks Frappucino bottles you can purchase in drink aisles, but with more of a coffee flavor.  It's quite nice.  Personally, not the type of thing that I would buy on any sort of regular basis since I don't really drink coffee, but I do think it is a nice drink.  Definitely worth a try for the iced coffee crowd.

review/summary: Good tasting coffee on the go
review/text: I've seen illy marketed in coffee shops before, but never had a chance to try it.  Didn't know they made on-the-go coffee drinks either.  The taste is very good and not overly sweet.  Felt the coffee taste could be slightly stronger for a cappuccino however.<br /><br />The tall slender can is distinctive, but slightly impractical.  The opening was too small, and I was only able to drink in tiny slurps.  Minus one star for reduced utility.

review/summary: Good low cal cappuccino
review/text: I really like iced lattes and cappuccinos and when I saw only 100 calories per can I was looking forward to trying it.  The flavor does not taste artificial (like other low cal coffees)  It has real sugar instead of corn syrup and low fat milk.  It is a bit too sweet for my taste but I normally don't like a lot of sugar in my coffee or blends so it might be ok for others.<br /><br />At first, I thought it didn't have enough coffee flavor or that it didn't have enough caffeine for my usual morning coffee but that changed right away.  It didn't make me nervous, I just felt more awake!  I think I'll try other flavors of the illy issimo brand to see if I like other blends better.

review/text: The first drink made me a little bit nervous... it's pretty strong!  Though I guess that cappucinos generally are. It seemed to mellow out a bit after the first drink and was really quite enjoyable.  I am a regular coffee drinker and this didn't wire me or keep me up all night so it must not be much stronger than a normal cup of coffee.  (I'm not sure about the relative caffeine contents it may even be less.)  Overall, very enjoyable.  If you try it I hope you like it as well and thanks for taking the time to read my review.

review/summary: It's OK, but nothing amazing
review/text: I love cappucinos, so I thought this would be a relatively easy item to review since I'm already pre-disposed to like anything that contains expresso. After drinking this, I can honestly say that I'm underwhelmed.<br /><br />Taste-wise, this isn't bad but it isn't great either. It's pretty much your run of the mill canned expresso beverage and while I've had worse, there wasn't that much to make it stand out. As others have said, the cocoa flavor just isn't there. That wouldn't actually be something I'd speak out against, except that the drink does claim that it's in there and there will be people who will be expecting to actually taste cocoa. It's not here, or if it is then it's so faint that you wouldn't be able to taste it unless you're really, really looking for it.<br /><br />Now the good thing about this is that it isn't overly sweet. I do like sweet coffee/expresso beverages, but a lot of times the bottled or canned beverages will be just overly saturated with it. This drink isn't, which was actually a nice change of pace and something that I know some of you will appreciate. Another thing that some might like is that it's only 100 calories for the full can, which was nice. It's still 19 carbs, but it's good to have a low calorie option for those of us that are trying to avoid the coffee drinks that have a bajillion calories.<br /><br />Overall, this just didn't stand out that much to me. It's good enough that I'd probably buy it if I was at the store, wanted a cold coffee/expresso drink, but didn't want anything sweet. I just don't know if I'd go out of my way to buy it and stock it up for those times when I really crave stuff like this.

review/summary: Yummy with a kick
review/text: A chilled can of illy isimo in the morning can give you a delicious little wake up kick. I had the cappuccino flavor which is espresso with a little milk and cocoa. After reading the ingredients on the can, I was expecting more of a chocolate flavor similar to a mocha, but a cappuccino has more of a coffee flavor with just a hint of chocolate.<br /><br />After the first couple of sips it tasted even more delicious. In fact, I probably could of drank a couple more, but then I would be extremely wired and probably regretting the decision. With one can you get a delicious caffeine wake-up that is only 100 calories. The taste may make you want more, but the caffeine in one can should be enough to get most people awake and starting the day, without any negative effects.

review/summary: Best Chocolate Coffee Drink I have had out of a can or bottle!
review/text: I must admit I was not expecting much from this product.  Monster Mocha Java is my favorite non barista made coffee product, but it lacks some in that great coffee house flavor due to all the great energy stuff they put in there, I love the energy the Monster Java provides so that is why it has been my favorite canned coffee product for the past 4 years.<br />Then there are Starbucks fraps, that just taste like some kind of gooey chemical is trying to take the place of cream or half and half or even the thickness added by ice chips, and the Starbucks leaves a not nice after taste in my mouth.<br />This "illy issimo" product is not anywhere close to a really good iced cappuccino made with yummy calories and whip cream and all the goodies by your favorite barista:  but,  it does taste as good as the ones I make at home.  I have a commericial espresso maker ( from once upon a dream when I had planned on starting my own coffee shop-- life is what happens while you are making other plans.)<br /><br />Slightly creamy, with no chemical taste, none whatsoever.<br />Nice chocolate taste without overpowering the coffee taste.<br />Not overly sweet, I tend to like my coffees less sweet than most people, so if you like your coffees sweeter,you may might like this.<br />I like the taste of the coffee it is just the right strength for me and with no chalky type taste.<br />I will buy this product when I do not have time or need the convience of having this great drink on hand for friends.<br />I will continue to make my own because of cost.  But it is great to know there is a product out there that tastes as good as my own..... and no preservatives.

review/summary: Lighter Alternative to Frappuccino
review/text: I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AIZKS">Starbucks Frappuccino</a>, but I don't get to drink it too often since it's a bit on a heavy side for a casual coffee-based drink IMHO. illy issimo cappuccino is a much lighter alternative to Farappuccino: it has half the calories (100 vs. 200) and fat (1.5 g vs. 3 g), albeit in a slightly smaller serving size. The lightness, of course, comes at a price and illy issimo cappuccino tastes as light as you would have expected it. It is made of medium-brew coffee, which is not that bad, but I prefer more full flavored varieties. This is a fairly tasty coffee-based energy drink, but it's not as impressive as illy issimo's espresso drinks. Nonetheless, I've enjoyed drinking it and would recommend it to most coffee lovers in a search of a convenient and tasty energy drink.

review/summary: Overwhelmingly underwhelming.  I've had better.
review/text: I've had brewed illy coffee before, and liked it.  I tried this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink</a>.  It's ok.  It is not overly sweet like other canned coffee drinks, but I also did not find this coffee drink to be flavorful or memorable.  In fact, I had to stir the inside with a straw just to see if everything settled at the bottom (it didn't).  Maybe I got a bum sample, or maybe my experience is typical.  I cannot say that I don't like it, but I also cannot see myself ordering it online or picking up a pack at the market.  I may drink it if it was given to me.  Or maybe I won't drink it.  Did it give me a caffein boost?  To be honest, I don't know.  But I had to order a cappuccino afterward to get an effective caffeine dose.<br /><br />This drink is comparable to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RGQQ0S">Starbucks Doubleshot Energy + Coffee Drink</a> at 100 calories (vs 110 for Starbucks).<br /><br />I may need to try out more, to give it a fair review.  However, based on my sample I would say this coffee drink is just meh.  Would I recommend it?  I don't know.  I haven't felt so blah about a product review before.  I will give it between a strong two-star and a weak three-star rating.

review/summary: It's OK
review/text: The cappuccino coffee was okay, considering there wasn't a lot of sugars in it and it was in a can; however, I think there are plenty of drinks out there that are way better.<br /><br />Taste: like a watered down cappuccino.<br /><br />Convenience: the best part; I don't have to worry about a glass bottle shattering, nor do I need to worry about a hot coffee cup. You're not supposed to shake it, which can be a pain, and once you open it, all bets are off.<br /><br />Caffeine: it took the entire can for me to feel any sort of kick, and even then, it wasn't that strong for me. I'm pretty sensitive to caffeine too.<br /><br />I would not buy these, either for the taste, or for the real purpose: to wake me up. If I really need a good pick me up, I would probably just go and buy a real cappuccino from a coffee shop. Or maybe one of those Starbucks fraps in the glass bottles.

review/text: I'm so glad to be able to order the Illy Issimo Cappuccino drinks by the case on Amazon, since my local stores are often sold out.  At 100 calories, this drink has about half the calories of a Starbucks bottled frappuccino.  It has a great coffee flavor with just a hint of chocolate and is sweet, but not overly.  It definitely tastes more like a coffee drink than chocolate milk; which is a problem with some of the competitors.  This is my go-to coffee drink for summer mornings and fans of Illy coffee would probably enjoy this variation on their favorite blend.

review/text: What a tasty drink, and just about the right size (8.5 oz.).  There really is no need for more words of description -- but here goes, anyway.  I've known the delightful taste of cappuccino for many years and have drunk it in many parts of the world.  Probably I've tasted better in Italy -- but I doubt it.<br /><br />One thing special about this can of ILLY cappuccino is it's served cold, not hot.  This means it's possible to taste cappuccinno in those summer months when hot drinks are not refreshing, but only a means for sweat on the brow.<br /><br />One Caution:  DO NOT SHAKE the can before opening.  I ignored this caution clearly written on the can and created a minor explosion.  No damage, though.  I was very happy to have the opportunity of sampling this very tasty drink.  I  suggest you try it too (and hope the "distillers" will ship me a case (gratis).

review/summary: Before Starbucks there was illy
review/text: I enjoy the Starbucks canned and bottled drinks. But before Starbucks made those (and possibly before Starbucks itself was around), illy has had packaged drinks for a number of years. For an excellent iced coffee beverage on the go, this is the best taste. It's not flavored, just plain espresso and milk. Although prices vary I have found that these (12 packs) are always available at a lower cost than the comparable Starbucks products. I will say that the Starbucks cappuccino is more milk and sweeter, but that the illy product is closer to what I would make at home or what you would find at a coffee shop if you ordered an iced cappuccino.

review/summary: Tastes good, but nothing spectacular
review/text: ily issimo Cappucino Coffee Drink was good, but the can size was a bit small.  It is hardly more than 1 cup and at nearly $2 each, I'm not sure it is worth it.  A bottled coffee drink by a national brand is nearly the same cost per ounce, but comes in a bottle and contains an ounce more.  I also expected a more robust flavor. The flavor is very similar to that which you would get from a high quality drip coffee that you could make at home.  Just add cocoa and chill and the flavor would be about the same.<br /><br />The good thing about the can size is that it fits very easily into a purse or backpack, the can is recyclable and there is no worry about breakage like with a bottled coffee.

review/summary: Good Refreshing Pick-Me-Ups
review/text: I might as well review both Illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink  & Illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink at the same time, since essentially the only difference is the additional lowfat milk and cocoa in the cappuccino.  I am not a daily addict of high end espresso drinks, but I do have both espresso & cappuccino now and then - often Starbucks, but not exclusively.  These Illy issimo coffee drinks have a distinctly nutty flavor - more distinctly so IMHO than the comparable Starbucks beverages.  No real bitter edge, so for those who need that, this may not work out for you.  Since this is so entirely a matter of taste and budget, I'll say I really like the taste but continue to roll my eyes at the prices - comparable to the Starbucks canned products you see at the grocery stores.  For a quick pick-me-up treat, I'm all in, and I'd prefer this over the Starbucks stuff.

review/text: I'm not a typical bottled coffee drinker.  I prefer mine the old fashioned way - hot and freshly brewed.  So, when I poured this over ice and drank it, I was quite surprised by how good it was.  The taste was smooth, not too strong and not too mild.  I liked the amount of sweetness and milk in the drink as well.<br />I still prefer my coffee hot, but I think once in a while I could see myself buying it as a pick-me-up in the afternoon during summer.

review/summary: illy Brand's New "issimo" Coffee Drink - Cappuccino In A Can
review/text: I have tried different illy brand products and have always enjoyed their products.  The new illy brand "issimo" which translates loosely to "extremely" or "remarkably" pretty much lives up to it's moniker.  At 8.45 oz. and 100 calories, it is a nice pick me up in the AM.  I only enjoy cold coffee products in the summertime when it's hot so I wouldn't be a year round drinker of issimo but I liked the flavor and especially the sweetness of the product.  It isn't sugary sweet, thick and doesn't have an overly "dairy" quality to it which I found nice.  Issimo is a light product that doesn't leave you feeling bloated or heavy.  At just under $2.00 a can, it's not the cheapest coffee beverage out there but it's certainly more cost effective than your local, upscale coffee shop.

review/summary: Weak espresso
review/text: illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink is a fairly new coffee to go drink for those times you need a coffee, but are cannot get to the coffee shop.  It is an 8.45 ounce, 100 calorie can of coffee-like goodness.<br />Yes, it actually does contain coffee.  Pretty good coffee, actually.  Illy is not new to the coffee world and some of their beans produce delicious coffee.  Its not surprising they decided to branch out to the portable market.  In doing so, they have joined forces with Coca Cola, likely because of their ability to mass market as well as produce an inexpensive canned product.<br />A cappuccino to an Italian is generally one third espresso, one third steamed milk, and one third foam.  Obviously the steamed milk and foam would be impossible in a chilled can.  But this is meant to be the chilled version of that drink.  Yet it contains cocoa.  Indiscernible cocoa, but it is right there on the label.  I find it a bit confusing, since there are actually 5 different illy flavors.  They also offer Cafe<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, Mochaccino,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UOA31I">illy issimo Mochaccino, 8.45-Ounces Cans (Pack of 12)</a> Cafe sugar free,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I2FGQE">illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink, No Sugar, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, latte macchiato, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJJI">illy issimo Latte Macchiato Coffee Drink, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.  I would have expected the mochaccino to have a chocolate flavor, and cappuccino to be strong espresso with milk.<br />So, upon opening the can, I expected a (Starbucks) canned frappuccino-like drink.  Despite the warnings stamped all around the top to not shake the can, I could not stop myself.  No explosion, so not sure what that warning is all about.  The coffee drink inside is a rich brown color, tempered with low fat milk.  Has a certain appeal, although I think it might feel more decadent poured over ice.  And while illy knows its coffee, they did not use enough of it in this prepared drink.  Strong espresso can stand up to the addition of milk, and this was not strong enough.  Had a watered down taste to it, much like home brewed coffee with added milk and sugar.  One thing I dislike about frappuccinos is the texture and somewhat artificial thickness.  illy wins hands down here, because the texture has not been altered.  It definitely feels real.<br />Keeping it under 100 calories is a plus, especially if one plans to drink these regularly.  Large fatty fattening coffees with sugar and cream should be reserved for special treats and given dessert status in our lives.  But you could get away with a 100 calorie drink much more often without sacrificing your health.<br />Overall, the Cappuccino Coffee drink is a pretty average addition to the ready to drink coffee market.  While the ingredients are well thought out (no high fructose corn syrup here!), the proportions left me feeling as though I had enjoyed some average coffee, watered down with milk and a bit of sugar sprinkled over.  Happy it was not any sweeter, just wish it had a richer coffee flavor.

review/summary: Very tasty, less caffeine than Starbucks's Doubleshot
review/text: For this review I will compare illy's issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink to another canned coffee drink I have often bought, the Starbuck's Doubleshot. I would consider these two coffee drinks to be close competitors in price and size.<br /><br />illy's canned issimo coffee drink is very tasty, is sweet but not overly so.  The illy drink is larger by volume (it's 8.45 oz to the Doubleshot's 6.5oz), so the illy drink has a more milky flavor--it also contains cocoa and so tastes a bit sweeter.<br /><br />As to caffeine content, the illy drink has 81mg, whereas the Doubleshot (per its name) has 130mg. So, in the Starbuck's drink you get more caffeine in fewer total fluid ounces. Thus the Starbucks Doubleshot has a stronger coffee taste than the illy issimo.<br /><br />For me then, the illy drink is better tasting however it does not provide as strong a caffeine punch as the Starbucks Doubleshot. Choosing between the two may be a matter of how much caffeine you feel you need at a given time. However on taste alone, illy's issimo beats the Starbucks Doubleshot.

review/text: I had already tried the illy issimo espresso canned drink, which I thought was pretty much just a cup of regular coffee poured into a can.  The cappuccino was a big improvement if like me you don't really like the bitterness of coffee.  There's enough milk and cocoa involved in the cappuccino version that you don't really taste the coffee.<br /><br />This tastes pretty similar to the Starbucks Frappuccino you can buy bottled from any local supermarket.  I don't think there's enough difference to really prefer one to the other.  So I would suggest you check out both products an see which one is going for cheaper.<br /><br />That is all.

review/text: This review is based on a single can received from the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />I'm a coffee guy.  I drink it almost every day.  My coffee brewing method of choice is a French Press, and I like a rich full bodied coffee.  I do like iced coffee, and I like sweets, so this thing seemed like a good fit.<br /><br />I tried this refrigerated, and that's a good thing.<br /><br />The coffee flavor was fine, but and not too sweet.  There was also a hint of chocolate.  Comparing this to a bottle of Starbucks Frappuccino, this has more coffee taste, and less milk and sugar taste.  I like that, but it is something to keep in mind.<br /><br />I would buy these to keep in the fridge for when I need a coffee pick me up.

Given the reputation, a very good one, I was expecting something special.  I am happy to say that I was not disappointed.<br /><br />First, I really liked the taste.  It tasted like real espresso.  It is not over sweet, like so many of the other canned or bottled coffee drinks.  Also, I liked its being thin and watery, rather than thick and syrupy like so many others.<br /><br />On the whole, my experience was a very positive one.  I must note, however, that it is a bit pricey.  Whether it is too pricey is left up to the individual consumer.

review/summary: Tastes good cold
review/text: Sure, this is not going to taste like a fresh cappuccino from your local coffee shop.  But you're buying a coffee product in a can--so adjust your expectations.  The Illy company has a small variety of canned coffee drinks and the cappuccino is my favorite so far.  It has a nice blend of coffee taste, chocolate flavor, and sweetness.  The small size makes it very portable and packable in a cooler or lunch box.  It has 100 calories and 18g of sugar.  It's not a health drink, nor an energy drink, but a coffee drink meant to be enjoyed for a break or as a treat.<br /><br />I would never drink this room temperature, it would be too chalky tasting and would probably have a funny aftertaste.  However, I did drink this sample cold (from the can) and poured most of it over ice in a glass (was better from a glass).  I found it refreshing on a warm afternoon and it was a nice pick-me-up.  I could taste the coffee and I could taste the cocoa and the texture was quite smooth.<br /><br />I enjoyed this product and it's definitely something I will purchase in the future (though I'll look for the best price for my budget).

I found it to be very good - strongly-flavored, smooth and not too sweet, with none of the chalky aftertaste of similar drinks I'd sampled in the past.  The espresso is definitely strong and it is nowhere near as sweet as a Frappuccino-style drink, but, since that's the flavor profile I prefer, I found it to be very tasty.  I would seek this drink out if I were stranded someplace without coffee.

review/text: This little can packs a good punch!  Lots of flavor and a caffeine boost.  Apparently, all for just 100 calories (according to the can).  The flavor is very rich but not so rich that you can't finish it.  I drank it right from the can, as I probably normally would and did notice a bit of a tin after taste from the can.  I poured the rest into a glass over some ice and it was excellent.  So if this is going to be your "on the road" solution, you might think again.  But, if you can enjoy it in a glass -- you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Good stuff!

review/summary: better than the coffee shop
review/text: I really love this product. I was running late one morning, didn't have time to make coffee (and cannot tolerate instant), so I popped the can, poured it in a cup, heated it in the microwave for 30 seconds, and enjoyed an excellent cup of cappuccino. It is every bit as good as what I buy at you know where. It is not too sweet, as many cappuccino drinks, especially the convenience ones, seem to be. I'd highly recommend it to any coffee drinker.

review/text: This is a sweet coffee beverage which we tried refrigerated.  We found it tasty, and less sweet than competing brands (Starbucks, Cappio).  Calories are still pretty steep (100 calories for the 8.45 oz can: equivalent to the calories in most sodas), likely owing to the use of dairy.

review/summary: Nice Mocha Taste, Not Quite As Sweet As Frappuccino
review/text: This Cappuccino Coffee Drink has a nice mocha taste.  It is not as sweet as a Starbucks Frappuccino; the coffee taste is stronger than Frappuccino.  It tastes good arm but is much better over ice or chilled.  For anyone who likes coffee flavored mixed drinks, this would make a good mixer for Bailey's (for a pretty sweet drink), Frangelico, Kahlua, or even vodka if you want a bit more of a kick!  If you want a sweeter, more candy-like taste then buy Frappuccino.  If you want something with a more robust coffee taste then opt for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.  At about $2.00 per can when purchased from Amazon the price of this item is reasonable.

review/summary: Enjoyable but not perfect
review/text: I've had some of the Illy canned drinks previously, though not the Cappuccino. I enjoy them as cold as I can get them and find them refreshing and an easy bit of caffeine boost during the mid-afternoon.<br /><br />The texture is light yet creamy. The coffee flavor could be more pronounced, though the flavor that's there is mostly nice. There is a pinch of bitterness but in some ways I'm not sure if it's the coffee or the can that I'm tasting. Disappointingly, for a cappuccino, I expected there to be the slightest tinge of cinnamon, but it's not there and not in the ingredients list either.<br /><br />One thing I can appreciate is the relatively short list of ingredients. Nothing unpronounceable, no artificial additives or preservatives.

review/summary: Thoughts from an experienced illy drinker
review/text: A little background:  I own a Gaggia for illy espresso machine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00416L8OQ">Gaggia for Illy Espresso Machine</a> that works with illy single-serve pods <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRE5D8">illy iperEspresso Capsules Dark Roasted Coffee, 5-Ounce, 21-Count Capsules</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRAWCQ">illy iperEspresso Capsules Medium Roasted Coffee, 5-Ounce, 21-Count Capsules</a>.  I like the flavor of illy espresso, but my favorite is still the Nespresso line of coffee <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UW1KLM">Nespresso Citz D110 Espresso Machine, Silver Chrome</a>.  When I saw that Coca-Cola was distributing illy in-a-can from Denmark, I immediately thought it might be a nice cold drink for my early morning, one-hour commute into the city.<br /><br />This morning I pulled two cans from the frig and drank them as I drove to work.  I tasted both the "cappuccino" and the "caffe" flavors.  Here are my thoughts:  The coffee in these cans is nothing like what you make at home in your espresso machine--the richness is missing.  illy makes a medium and a dark roast.  The coffee in these cans are more like the medium roast--definitely not dark.  But, bottom line, coffee in a can tastes exactly as you feared it would:  Coffee with that "special" canned taste.<br /><br />Comparing the two flavors that I sampled this morning, I like the cappuccino better than the caffe <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.  I think the cappuccino works better than the caffe as a cold drink.  The cappuccino went down quickly and easily, but there was an aftertaste that I didn't quite like.  Even after finishing the second coffee (the caffe without milk), I could still taste the lowfat milk and it was not fresh-tasting.  I'm not used to sweetness in my espresso and the sugar in these cans made the coffee taste a bit tangy.  I did not notice any bitterness in either of the flavors.<br /><br />Be aware of the size of these cans:  They are not as large as soda pop cans.  They are narrow cans, with the cappuccino can about an inch taller than the caffe can.  I mention this because I had trouble finding a place to set in my vehicle's console because they are so narrow.  Your vehicle's can-holder space will be too large for these cans.  You  would have to wedge them in somehow to keep them from toppling.<br /><br />So, as with most everything else that you buy for convenience-sake, with these coffee drinks you sacrifice flavor for handiness.  If you really don't have time in the evening to put together a bottle of iced coffee for your morning commute, then the cappuccino is not a bad drink.  If you like a sweet coffee and if you like milk in your coffee, then the cappuccino is not a bad choice.  Personally, even though I don't have any extra time in the evening, I think I'll try to find the time to build myself an iced coffee for the morning--because I've just realized that it is very pleasant to have cold coffee to drink for my long commute, and canned coffee is not to my taste.

review/summary: A delicious and relatively low calorie pick me up
review/text: I really enjoy these Illy Issimo Cappuccino drinks.  If you love coffee like I do, you'll find the taste to be rich and delicious.  It's a terrific blend of "Italian espresso style coffee", lowfat milk, cocoa and sugar.  The cocoa flavor is very subtle.  It's there, but you might not know it if you weren't looking for it.<br /><br />Nutritionally, each 200ml (8.45 ounce) can is 100 calories, 15 of which come from fat.  It has 19 grams of carbs, 1 gram of fiber and 5 grams of protein.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this is health food, but I think it's a lot better for you then a soda and definitely gives you a bit of an energy boost, although I wouldn't consider it to be an energy drink.<br /><br />Illy is renown for producing some of the finest espresso in the world and the quality of this product is exactly what you would expect from a name that is almost synonymous with espresso.  This product is made from 100% Arabica beans which seem to be roasted to a full city roast, or thereabouts.  Illy Issimo is produced in Denmark under a collaboration between illy and Coca Cola.<br /><br />Let me also be clear that my rating has nothing to do with the cost of this item.  You'll have to make a value determination on your own.  While I do a lot of shopping at Amazon, I purchased this item at Big Lots for less than a third of the current price at Amazon.  I've also seen the price fluctuate substantially here at Amazon.<br /><br />I really look forward to having a can of illy Issimo cappuccino at almost any time of the day.  I highly recommend it and I think you'll enjoy it too!

review/summary: "DO NOT SHAKE"... but would it taste better if I did?
review/text: Interesting beverage, this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Cans</a>. It's a Cappucino with the name misspelled, (should be "Cappuccino"), a product of Denmark from illycaff&egrave; SpA, which is based in Milan, Italy, and it's distributed by Coca-Cola. Is this the new international globalism in coffees? Not sure where the can is made.<br /><br />Not posting any calorie counts or other such levels here, and they can all be found in the product description, including that it uses rBST-free milk. But for those who don't know, rBST-free milk is the good kind, as rBST (recombinant bovine somatotropin) is a synthetic version of the Bovine somatotropin (BST) hormone found in cattle. It's the hormone that's used by many commercial dairies to increase milk production, and it's been marketed under a number of names.  I'll stay away from that controversy here, but find it to be good that this beverage is rBST-free.<br /><br />First Look:<br /><br />Noticed the "DO NOT SHAKE" warning posted four times around the rim of the can. Don't know what that's all about, but stuck it into the fridge along with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans</a> that I received at the same time. That one also had the "DO NOT SHAKE" admonition on the rim.  As neither of these are carbonated, don't know what to make of that.<br /><br />Taste:<br /><br />Tried this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino</a> the following day after it had chilled.  First impression was that it wasn't bad, a little watery perhaps, and thinner than expected. It got better with the second sip, and did get better than others of this type that I've tasted before (like Starbucks Frappuccino, etc). There's a real coffee taste, which I appreciated. The milk and/or cream part wasn't overpowering, which did allow the coffee taste to come through. Glad to say that it lacked the sweet dairy flavor of many of the popular drinks in grocery stores, many of which come from artificial sweeteners.  There was a mild aftertaste that remained ten minutes later; not unpleasant, but not great, either.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Must note that I'm one of those who as a rule drinks coffee black, with no sweeteners, cream or creamy substitutes. That being said, I did prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;</a> over this "Cappucino" variant. This one might have had a more full-bodied flavor, but it wasn't objectionable in the least. Using the Amazon star rating system, I'll say it's OK, a decent 3-star product, and one that I might buy if I had company over for the evening, along with the illy issimo Caff&egrave; for those wanting a stronger taste... and for myself.<br /><br />Still tempted to ignore that "DO NOT SHAKE" warning and just try it to see what happens...<br /><br />6/6/2012

review/summary: Only 100 calories!? The rich flavor will surprise you
review/text: At 100 calories per can, illy issimo Cappuccino delivers the rich flavor you might expect involves a much higher caloric tradeoff. My wife was happy that we had the opportunity to review it for free as part of Amazon's Vine program. She immediately signed up for a regular case shipment through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program, which offers a 15% discount.<br /><br />Here's our conversation:<br /><br />HOW does it taste?<br /><br />"Not too sweet. I feel like this is an adult coffee drink, not a milkshake in disguise."<br /><br />WHEN would you drink it?<br /><br />"In the afternoon, when I need a kick, when the kids come home from school and before dinner."<br /><br />WHAT else?<br /><br />"I'd serve this when my friends come over. And I'd take a can to work, I'd take a can anywhere."<br /><br />The 100 calories was a big selling point for my wife and illy issimo Cappuccino highlights that point by including on their label. The picture I added with this review shows you how much lighter this blend is versus the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Caff&egrave;</a>, which we also tested and reviewed for Amazon.<br /><br />In summary, illy issimo Cappuccino reminded my wife of the delicious canned coffees she used to enjoy when we lived in Japan. The fact that this brand is more affordable and lower in calories are just two more reasons to buy.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars<br /><br />* 100% natural Arabica coffee<br />* No preservatives<br />* rBST-free milk*<br />* OU-D Kosher<br />* Sweetened with beet sugar<br />* 8.45 fluid ounces (250 milliliters) per can<br /><br />Nutritional Information:<br />* 100 calories<br />* 1.5 grams of fat<br />* 18 grams of sugar<br />* 81 milligrams of caffeine

review/summary: Yes, it's canned, but it's not bad
review/text: There's no way you are ever going to get the richness and full flavor of fresh-brewed coffee out of a canned drink.  But once you acknowledge that, you can enjoy this cold cappuccino for what it is.  It's a refreshing, energizing, naturally "coffee-flavored" beverage that you can keep in your fridge, ready to go in an instant.<br /><br />I like that there are no alarming ingredients...well, except for sugar, but that's not unexpected.  But yeah, there's a lot of sugar, 19g.  If they came out with a Splenda-sweetened version, they'd really have something.<br /><br />Actually, I'm not a coffee drinker, but I do enjoy coffee dessert-beverages (such as DQ's MooLatte), and I could drink this, so that gives you an idea of the level of sweetness in this drink.  If you like your coffee dark and strong, you might not like this.<br /><br />To make this Illy Issimo drink even more to my liking, I added about a half cup of milk and some Splenda.  Drinking the whole thing down in a couple of minutes, I got a quick caffeine rush.  I can imagine that this would be fantastic as a breakfast drink with the extra protein from the added milk (put it in your insulated travel cup to keep it cold and give you room for milk; the can this comes in is too narrow for your cup holder, anyway).<br /><br />Overall, I think this is an impressive, tasty, quality product.  If you enjoy sweet, cold coffee, you'll enjoy this.

review/summary: Not bad, ummm, no, good!
review/text: I'm not a big cold coffee drinker, but occasionally I have a taste for coffee and don't particularly feel like warming up. That's when I'll have a can of coffee like this Illy Issimo. I like the taste of this product because it isn't too sweet. (I normally take my coffee with sweetener and creamer of some kind.) It's just sweet enough to make it tasty for me, but not so cloyingly sweet that the coffee taste can't come through. The coffee flavor is rich and creamy, more or less what you would expect of a cappuccino. What you wouldn't expect with this low level of sweetness in a coffee, however, is the high level of calories (100 for a 8 ounce can). That's maybe not a deal breaker, but it's a far cry from the 20 calories of a regular cup of coffee with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OQ257C">Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener with Antioxidants, 80-Count Box  (Pack of 4)</a> and a non-dairy creamer. Still, the taste is good and I like the convenience and size of this can, so I'm okay giving it a four star rating.

review/summary: Very appealing over ice
review/text: I don't usually drink iced coffee drinks because I tried one a few years ago and thought it tasted awful.  But I was pleasantly surprised with this Cappucino illy issimo Coffee Drink. It's excellent over ice.  Right out of the can, at room temperature, not so much.  But I think these types of drinks are meant to be served very cold.  (Or maybe heated?  I didn't think to try warming it, but I think hot would probably work too.)  What I liked was that it had a very 'clean' taste, no funny aftertaste like some canned drinks have.  In fact, there was no aftertaste at all.  There was just the right balance of coffee, sugar, milk and a little bit of cocoa powder so it wasn't too sweet.  I didn't notice the cocoa powder taste when I drank it.  I think it just adds to the overall flavor.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients:  Coffee, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, potassium bicarbonate, celluose gel, potassium citrate, cellulose gum, carrageenan.  The caffeine content is 81 mg per the 8.45 ounce can.  Compare that to 48 mg. per 16.9 ounces of caffeine in Coke Zero. Compared to that, this drink delivers a pretty potent punch and could be considered kind of an energy drink, but still not as strong as their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> at 155 mg. caffeine per 6.9 ounce can.<br /><br />All in all a quick, convenient and good tasting coffee drink when poured over ice.

review/summary: Delicious Italian cappuccino on the go!
review/text: I first tried the illy issimo espresso and, despite being a guy who doesn't do plain espresso or even straight-up black coffee, I actually kind of liked it. Quality is quality and coffee is yet another thing Italians do well. With that said, the cappuccino is a better fit for my personal tastes--not as strong, not as bold as the espresso. It's *really* good and I'm actually drinking some while I write this.<br /><br />When my girlfriend saw a can of this sitting in my apartment she got excited. We met in an Italian language class in college and she actually had the opportunity to study in Italy for a summer. She said illy issimo coffee products are everywhere in Italy, which I take as either great market saturation or a ringing endorsement of what Italians think about the brand. After enjoying it myself, I'm going to go with the latter.

review/summary: I really enjoyed it - not a major coffee drinker
review/text: I am not a huge coffee fan - I prefer my coffee in a dessert style: creamy and sweet. The Starbucks mocha Frapachinos (bottled) are usually the only coffee-esque drink that I like, and even those I only drink a few times a year. The illy issimo Cappuccino wasn't bad - it wasn't nearly as creamy as the Starbucks drinks, but it was also around a half of the calories, so there's a bit of give and take there. It's also not super sweet - many of the Starbucks drinks border on that thin line between really tasty and "The sugar is melting my teeth". The illy issimo is very safely stashed on the not-super-sweet side of the fence. Don't take that to mean there isn't any sweetness - I'd compare it to a Symphony chocolate bar versus a Hershey's milk chocolate bar. They both have very similar flavor profiles, but the generic Hershey bar is so much sweeter. I can't really say it's like a dark chocolate either, because the cappuccino didn't have a lot of the bitter undertones that the dark chocolates and espresso drinks tend to have.<br /><br />As for energy burst, I should preface by saying that I'm not much of a caffeine drinker any more. My normal drink is straight water, and at restaurants iced tea (unsweet). I think my body has stored up reserves of caffeine and sugar from my childhood days though - back when I drank a six-pack (or more) of Coke a day. That being said, the "rush" from the drink took a few hours for me to feel it (granted I had already eaten lunch and had a full stomach, which might explain the lag). But when it hit, it was a sort of "giddy" high, not like a super pixie-stick rush. I also can't say I experienced much of a telltale caffeine crash either, the extra energy just quietly bled away.<br /><br />All-in-all, should I decide to pick up a coffee drink, I wouldn't hesitate to get another one from illy issimo.

review/summary: Coffee in a Can
review/text: There is no crazy, out of control flavoring with this one. It's coffee in a can. If you like coffee, you'll like this. Unlike other energy drinks which tend to taste like medicine, this one tastes real. I even did a little experiment. I pounded the thing. Usually that's not recommended with energy drinks. It didn't get my heart rate up or anything like that but it woke me up real nice (only had 3 hours of sleep the night before I drank it). You could probably warm it up and it would taste like a regular coffee or pour it over ice and have an ice coffee. Keep in mind that there's milk in this. It's a hundred calories, so it's not one of those low calorie or zero calorie things. Other than that, have at it!

review/summary: Not too sweet but tasted a little thin
review/text: I love all kinds of coffee, from light to dark roasts.  I don't like really sweet foo foo coffee drinks (with a bunch of nuts, whipped cream, and caramel drizzled over the top) but have enjoyed Starbucks shelf-stable frappuccino blended drinks on occasion.  So I thought it would be interesting to try illy issimo's version of a shelf-stable coffee concoction.  I drank it chilled which is probably how this is meant to be enjoyed, but your mileage may vary.  First impression:  I was a little disappointed at how "thin" the coffee taste was.  Not very robust, as I was hoping it would be.  But the taste was smooth enough, and it was lightly sweetened, not heavily so, and no bitter aftertaste.  It only has 100 calories, but again it's a mere 8 ounces of a drink.  I would probably drink it again if someone offered it to me, but I won't be purchasing it at the store.  It was good. Okay, but not great or worth seeking out.  I'll buy the Starbucks again instead should I ever get a hankering for a shelf-table, from-the-grocery-store blended coffee drink.

review/summary: Smooth & Refreshing Alternative
review/text: I was expecting this coffee drink to taste like most of the others that clutter the grocery shelves, but it wasn't.  The can proclaims that it is a Italian style coffee and surprisingly this gave a very distinct flavor.  The coffee is not overwhelming but it is distinct.  I feel like too many coffee go for bold harsh french dark roast style flavors, whereas the illy issimo is more of a smooth yet bold flavor.  The boldness is there, but not as a heavy aftertaste - more of a mid-taste contrast to the slightly mocha flavoring.  The mocha flavor here is aromatic but not overtly chocolate in taste.  As a whole I think those that find canned coffee redundant - try this.  It is different and a nice change of pace.

review/summary: Very nice taste. Small serving size.
review/text: This has a very nice flavor. I tried is chilled. The coffee taste is rich and bold, but not bitter. It is sweetened. I usually do not sweeten my coffee. The sweetness is mild to moderate, and is not excessive.  The 8.45 oz size is a little small. Not your typical American portion. I can see drinking 2 at a time, which can be a little expensive.<br />__<br /><br />My 4 star rating is for the product only. I had some problems with the packaging/delivery that the typical buyer should not encounter. I was sent a single sample can to try. It was delivered in a cushioned envelope and the can was very beat up and dented. I was surprised it hadn't leaked in the mail. When I opened the can it sprayed me with coffee. This should not be a problem when ordering a case because it will probably come in a box.

review/text: As coffee in a can goes, this is pretty darn good stuff.  The flavor is smooth with a slight creaminess, and there's absolutely no bitterness.  It doesn't exactly taste like a hot cappuccino (or even an iced one from a coffee shop), but it's still definitely coffee.  There was more sweetener in this than I prefer, and I found it to be a touch too sweet.  Still, for coffee in a can, this is probably about as good as it gets- no weird aftertaste, and no strange flavors.

review/summary: OK
review/text: I decided to try this on a cold day, so I poured it into my favorite coffee mug and nuked it until it was just the right temperature for me. The can doesn't specify whether this is supposed to be a cold drink or a hot one, so I see no problem with doing this.<br /><br />I also must admit to being someone who isn't particularly fond of flavored and messed with coffee, so keep that in mind when you evaluate my review.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed.<br /><br />The illy Cappuccino had a very creamy, chocolatey mouth feel. It was somewhat too sweet for me, but that could be a result of heating it. We perceive sweetness differently depending upon temperature. That's why ice cream requires a lot of sugar and why little kids who love sweetness will often let their ice cream melt before they consume it--to make it seem that much sweeter. As a cold drink the sweetness might be right. That seems to be the prevailing opinion in the other reviews here, so I'll defer to their judgement.<br /><br />I also detected an under-taste of some sort. I'm sorry I can't identify it for you, but I'm certain it was there and I got it on every sip. Perhaps it's just the type of cocoa used here, which I'm not used to in coffee, but I knocked off another star since I disliked it whatever it was.<br /><br />The 8.45 ounce can contains 100 calories and 81 milligrams of caffeine.

review/summary: It's canned coffee at its best
review/text: I don't mean to be nasty, really! Giving the product 4 stars proves that. It's convenient and if you are a confirmed caffeine addict, having one of these in your car will save the day. It's preferable by far to an over-percolated cup of joe made from stale ground beans. But it is a far cry from a well-pulled shot. If you know what you're getting and that is acceptable, I recommend this over the Starbucks Double Shot (similar product) for the following reasons: it's not as sweet, it seems lighter and less thickened by gums or fillers, and Illy beans are consistent and good if you like a dark roast. You can taste the evaporated milk, but some people enjoy that. People seem to like working for Starbucks, but remember what life was like before there was one on every street corner? Buck the trend, and try this Illy drink!

review/summary: Enjoyable, and less sweet than Frappuccino drinks
review/text: I enjoyed this issimo coffee drink.  At 100 calories, this 8.45 ounce can has almost 50% fewer calories than the 9.5 ounce Mocha Frappuccino (180 calories).  I appreciate the caffeine information, which says that this small can contains 81 mg. caffeine, compared to 35 mg. in a 12 oz. Coke.  The aluminum can is attractive, more energy efficient than glass, easier to handle due to its light weight and reduced breakage, and easily recycled. I don't think I will be buying those Starbucks fraps anymore!

review/text: I drink a lot of coffee.  I drink lattes, cappuccinos, espressos, you name it.  I have tried other packaged coffee drinks before (i.e. Starbucks Frappuccinos and Caribou Coffee) and have always found them to be very sweet, but this one from illy issimo, I thought, was very bitter.  On the outside of the can it does state that cream and sugar are included, but I could not taste it.  The only reason I am not giving this one out of five stars is because this is solely based on my personal taste, and there might be others out there that like a much stronger taste, and would like something like this.  I also liked the packaging, as I brought this to work with me for a mid-day boost and found it easy to throw into my lunch bag.

review/summary: Great-tasting iced coffee drink
review/text: At first blush, the illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink reminds me of those refrigerated Starbucks Frappuccino bottled drinks you can pick up at a convenience store. However, the illy issimo has a much more defined coffee flavor. It's smooth, not too sweet, and has just the barest hint of chocolate. And at 100 calories and 1.5 grams of fat, it's not going to be a diet buster if you enjoy one every so often. (Honestly, I was surprised at the relatively low calorie and fat content--this stuff tastes GOOD!) As for the caffeine content, at 81 mg, it's on par with a Red Bull and has less caffeine than a cup of brewed coffee. Of course, it's cheaper to make your iced coffee at home, but if I feel the need for a pre-packaged coffee drink, I'll definitely reach for the illy issimo before any other brand!

review/text: When it has came down to us coffee drinkers, we often try to find the best tasting cup to start off the morning, and even the best iced coffee drinks all the way around. For Illy, they have made good coffee drinks, but this one I was honestly skeptical of trying. Their Illy Issimo Cappuccino coffee drink isn't bad, but honestly not as thick or driven as other iced coffee drinks I have had in other places, like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts. While it isn't bad, there really is much that makes it try and stand out from all the rest. Illy has had some good coffee drinks, but more should honestly have been done for their canned, ready to drink cappuccino.<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Taste: C+<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2+

review/summary: Hits the Spot
review/text: While not a huge consumer of canned iced coffee drinks I was excited to try Illy's Issimo Cappucino Coffee Drink.  Other canned coffee drinks  I have tried have ranged from acceptable to retched.  As Illy is a respected "high end" brand of coffee, I had higher hopes than usual and overall, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I poured  the contents into a glass with two ice cubes.  It smelled good with a light coffee fragrance.  The initial taste was neutral, with a medium coffee flavor and chocolate overtones.  It seemed a bit watery as well.  I cannot say that it tasted a lot like a cappuccino, but overall was agreeable.  After finishing the drink, I noticed no unpleasant aftertastes that can sometimes plague canned coffee drinks.  The ingredients did not read too much like a chemistry experiment, so that comes as a relief.<br /><br />Overall, I'd rate this an enjoyable drink, not exactly something that I can say that I crave, but one that I would choose over other competitors if I wanted a cool pick me up in a pinch.  I do see that they are priced on the higher end of the scale of the competition, but I would say that it merits the extra change required.

review/summary: Not bad overall - would pick if I can't find my all time favorites
review/text: I went ahead and tried this - the idea of a coffee drink in a can in this country under 100 calories is always inviting.  (I love Japan and China where there are so many different ones some served hot some cold, all from vending machines and convenience stores, but the US is sadly much more limited).<br /><br />Rockstar Vanilla Roasted remains my number one choice for canned or bottled coffee.  That said, I enjoyed this and would choose it over pretty much anything made by Starbucks and DEFINITELY over anything made by Archer Farms (or whatever that Target brand is) or Monster (ew, ew, ew) that's in my local grocery or gas station.<br /><br />I like it because 1) it actually tastes like coffee instead of some weird flavored creme thing and 2) it isn't horribly sweet - maybe a tad more than I prefer but I like my sweetness really low in cold coffee so that's a personal preference.  The aftertaste is good...pleasant not strong and not going sour an hour later.  The coffee kick is also there so it's a good pick me up.<br /><br />However, it's still not perfect.  A few complaints: 1) It's got a bitter metallic taste that hits every time you first get some in your mouth.  It's not a normal coffee or espresso flavor - it fades quick and isn't horrible, but it's weird and not my favorite, 2) the can is a little flimsy.  The edges rolled over on the top of mine even though it shipped in a padded envelop.  I don't know that it would puncture any easier though - most cans are thin at around the cylinder.  3) biggest complaint - the mouth is too small.  You couldn't glug it if you want to, but it's also kind of awkward.  Basically forces sipping and makes it so it's hard not to completely cover it with your mouth if you're used to other cans which creates a bad situation for flow (for a liquid to flow into your mouth easily, air has to flow into the can easily to replace it.)<br /><br />Anyway, 4 stars.  If I don't have access to my own french pressed coffee from home, don't feel like paying for specialty coffee, and can't find the Rockstars on shelf, I could see reaching for this as the next choice when I really want some coffee flavored caffeine.

It can be enjoyed cold in a frosty glass or straight out of the can (as I had mine).<br /><br />It does taste just like real cappuccino.  The can clearly states to not shake the ingredients-I accidentally did this anyway, and it did not seem to affect the cappuccino flavors at all.  This drink would be perfect for someone who does not want to stop at a coffee store to buy a regular cappuccino. The only drawback to this item is the price for a 12 pack.

While it won't replace skinny hazelnut lattes in my heart, it's got an enjoyable taste and 81 mg of caffeine per can. While the Starbucks Doubleshot Coffee-Mocha is sweeter (and thus better tasting, in my opinion), the illy issimo drink has a mere 100 calories to the Starbucks' 200--and I'd rather save the 100 calories.

If I found some at a store, I'd probably buy it, but I prefer some of the caffeinated juice drinks that've started appearing on the market.<br /><br />There are those who've expressed disappointment that the drink didn't taste enough like coffee. They do have an Espresso version, perhaps that would be more to their liking. For me personally (someone who isn't a coffee junkie), I had no problem with it.

review/summary: Better chilled
review/text: I decided to test this drink in three ways.  Chilled, Iced, Hot.<br /><br />I first put the can in the refrigerator over night.  I then divided the can into three equal portions a little less than 3 oz. each.<br /><br />One I poured into a small glass, the second I poured over crushed ice, and the third I put into a cup and heated it to normal coffee temperature in the microwave.<br /><br />I then tasted the chilled but un-iced drink.  I found the coffee flavor came through well enough, but the additives gave it a slightly off flavor from the pure cappuccino taste.<br /><br />I then tasted the iced version - after stirring the liquid in the glass along with the crushed ice.  The flavors disappeared to a marked degree - a slight coffee taste, but mostly just a cold beverage with a coffee background.<br /><br />I then tasted the microwaved version - the coffee flavors were there, but it just tasted like a weak cup of coffee - certainly not a cappuccino.<br /><br />As an afternoon drink when real coffee is not available and you want that coffee flavor, this drink makes an acceptable beverage to gulp down chilled.<br /><br />Don't expect this to be anything like a real strong cup of real cappuccino or espresso.<br /><br />As an explanation of my own preferences - I like very strong coffee - Turkish being my absolute favorite.  Also, an iced coffee properly prepared is a thing of delight to me.  The best I ever had was at a small place in Kyoto where the very strong coffee was chilled and served over ice in a tall glass, with a separate small pitcher of cream, and another of a simple sugar syrup, allowing the consumer to "fix it the way they wanted."

In fact, it tastes almost exactly like a fresh iced-coffee with milk, with a hint of chocolate. It's sweet but not overwhelming. Of course, it's missing that classic coffee "bitterness," (which, I suppose, a lot of people dislike anyway), but it's still definitely a beverage I'd be happy to drink two, or even three, at a time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these coffee-drinks are often a bit pricey, and Illy is no exception. Even buying a 12 pack here on Amazon, you're spending (as of this review) 23 cents per ounce, which is a lot for a beverage. In comparison, brewing an iced-coffee at home would cost a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />However, if you're willing to pay for it, then you can't go wrong here. As I said, the taste is delicious, and the caffeine content (81mg per can) and nutritional content (100 cal, 1.5g fat) is comparable to coffee w/ milk.

review/summary: Worth the hundred calories!
review/text: This was a really, yummy coffee drink.  It's very similar tasting to star bucks or Seattles best  iced coffee that are comparable in size.  It's very pleasant--not too coffee tasting, but not too sugary, with a touch of cream and cocoa.  Decent calorie content, and a surprising  5 grams of protein.  Cost is under $2.00 or less (depending on if you do subscribe and save) so a fair price.

review/summary: tastes like gourmet iced coffee
review/text: illy issimo Cappucino Coffee Drink is really good!  It reminded me of a gourmet iced coffee from an expensive Italian restaurant.  Can't believe something out of a can has this much flavor.  I'll definitely buy this again.

review/summary: Good, but a little small.
review/text: For a canned coffee drink this is pretty tasty.  Its not overpowering in its strength, nor is it overly sugary either.  Its a nice balance and definitely tastes like coffee.<br /><br />I would like the cans to be a bit bigger, but what could I expect for a 100 calorie drink?  Even if you downed two, you'd still be making a much better nutritional choice than a regular cafe mocha from the 'bucks (which I truly love but do not for a second pretend is low calorie in any way).

review/summary: Awful taste. Good picker-upper, though.
review/text: The drink offers an incredible amount of boost, but unfortunately the taste is incredibly lacking. We recently had a strange heat wave in Chicago, so maybe en route to delivery the package became warm, and subsequently ruined some of the flavor in the drink? I'm not sure.<br /><br />Still, the top of the lid says not to shake, so I did notice that more flavor swam into my mouth when the can was almost empty, so perhaps it needed to be shaken after all. Still, the taste at the end was not enough to justify me ever getting this again.

review/summary: It's fine, but I like a stronger taste.
review/text: I didn't find anything wrong with this canned coffee drink, but I prefer a stronger taste--stronger coffee and stronger chocolate. I really couldn't identify either in this formulation. I like my mocha stuff strong enough to walk. LOL!

review/summary: Excellent coffee drink
review/text: I am not usually a cappuccino drinker, but I love Illy coffee and was eager to try this canned drink. There is a bit more milk than I prefer, but the coffee taste comes through nicely, and it is not too sweet. I thought I tasted some sort of flavoring (perhaps it was the cocoa); at first taste it seemed odd, but I came to enjoy it as I drank the rest of the can. I found a metallic aftertaste in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, but I did not notice any such aftertaste in this cappuccino. Overall I think is an excellent coffee drink.

review/summary: Tastes Great!
review/text: This illy issimo "italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa" is quite delicious. The cocoa taste is subtle and it is not too sweet. The smooth taste beats out other similar prepackaged drinks I've tried.<br /><br />Each 200ml / 8.45 oz. can is only 100 calories, 1.5g fat and 4g of protein, so it feels like a decent choice nutritionally. It contains 81mg of caffeine, if you are counting.<br /><br />illy roasts good coffee and even masked by the sugar and milk, you can tell this 100% Arabica coffee is the good stuff. It is very smooth, no bitter / burnt taste like some coffee roasters are prone to. These drinks are made in Denmark and distributed by Coca Cola in the US, which piqued my interest. I'd recommend these to people who like to have some cold coffee drinks on hand for busy mornings or a quick pick me up.

review/summary: Better than Starbucks...
review/text: But it's not better than Starbucks by a lot. The good thing is tt's less sweet and a little thinner than the Starbucks canned coffee drinks. Cappuccino should be pretty much only coffee and milk foam, but of course in a can you can't really get this, so things like sugar and cocoa are added to enhance the drink. If you like that idea, these will go over pretty well. I think the coffee flavor is a bit stronger in this version and I would choose it over the Starbucks equivalent for that reason. You're probably not a coffee snob if you're shopping for these, but they are a definite convenience if you're not near a coffee bar. I think I'll consider bringing these along on camping trips and other outings where caffeine is not readily available.

review/summary: Weird aftertaste
review/text: I tried the drink cold first but didn't enjoy the taste much.  I could taste the espresso; however, there was also an odd aftertaste--perhaps the carrageenan acting as an emulsifier.  Some people can taste the seaweed and other additives while others can't, so that could explain the ratings discrepancies based on taste.  To me, the drink was also kind of weak and blah.  I'm not sure how to explain it.  What's with the "do not shake" instructions?  It isn't carbonated.  Probably the emulsification factor again.  After trying the drink cold, I heated it up, which defeats the purpose of a cold can of coffee to go, but whatever.  It was actually a little better warmed but not enough for me to buy it in the future.<br /><br />Pros: Only 100 calories, 1.5 grams fat, 100% natural Arabic beans, no preservatives (which means keep it cool and dark and use by the expiration date), and convenient size for purses, briefcases, desk drawers, etc.<br /><br />Cons: 18 grams of sugar!, taste, storage requirements, expense

review/summary: Can't complain about this coffee; good size and flavor.
review/text: There's nothing particularly wonderful about canned coffee, in my opinion, but there are some things I like: the convenient, single-serving size, and the time I save by not having to go to a store and wait in line for my coffee.<br /><br />Illy issimo Cappuccinno Drink is just another entry into the long line of canned coffee drinks produced by different companies. I've only ever tried the Starbucks versions of bottled coffee, and I think illy's is a good competitor.<br /><br />Most importantly, the flavor is to my taste: milky, with a coffee taste that's not too strong and not acidic, not overly sugary (which is what i fault Starbucks for), and a hint of chocolate. It was like drinking a light mocha. I give extra points for using real sugar, lowfat milk, and adding cocoa. The drink went down smoothly with no sticky or bad aftertaste. I finished the can quickly, even though the total volume was a little over a cup. Overall, this small can of coffee made the drive to work this morning a little more pleasant, and hopefully the caffeine will be enough to keep me alert for the rest of the morning.

review/summary: Review for illy issimo cappuccino drink
review/text: I thought this drink tasted good both cold and heated up. I liked that it did not make me feel like I was getting cavities, unlike the starbucks bottled coffee, yet it was still sweet enough since I don't like drinking coffee black. The caffeine content is 81 mg per 8.45 oz can, comparable to a cup of coffee and to similarly sized energy drinks.
