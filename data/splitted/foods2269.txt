review/text: Excellent taste without the cream cheese frosting and the calories.  Hits the spot and doesn't stimulate overeating.  Good ingredients.<br /> I won't be reordering because Larabar's parent company (General Mills) is financing the fight against GMO labeling.  So sad we are  controlled by big business who are contaminating our seeds and food crops.  See John Robins blog.

review/summary: Healthy RAW Snack
review/text: Some people say these are a high fat , high calorie , high glycemic , glorified candybar. I say otherwise. Concerning fat, not all fats are equal , some being healthy . Since this bar is raw all of the fat,protein and sugar have not been denatured  which means you get the full health benefit. As far as being high calorie , considering how nutrient dense these babies are I don't consider 200 calories high in calories at all. For me 200 calories is a perfect number allowing it to be used an nutrient dense snack or a quick meal on the go.<br /><br />Concerning these supposedly being high glycemic , sure , if you were to eat the dates in these by themselves it would be , but the nuts in them bring the glycemic load of the entire bar way down , which is another benefit of the healthy fats in these bars , it allows for the sugars to be released slower and for it to digest slower making you feel full and satisfied longer.<br /><br />As far as these not being any better than a candybar I say noway! No preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup , etc, in these babies , just a healthy combo of fruit and nuts. How many nutrients does a candybar have ? Now look at the nutrient in these , loaded with minerals . Also, unlike many other foods these aren't naturally low in nutrients and then "fortified" with man made vitamins and minerals to make them then appear healthy. All the nutrients in these are naturally occuring which gives you the benefits in a synergistic way where other healthy compounds such as flavonoids and phenols work together with naturally occurring vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />People need to let go of the old dogma which makes them think all fat is bad but if it's sugar free then it MUST be good. If that were true then cotton candy , pepsi and skittles would all be great for ya !Fruit and nuts makes for a good healthy breakfast or snack. I'll eat my greens/green smoothies in the other meals of the day. A person shouldn't eat only fruit and nuts during the day but they shouldn't only eat greens either . These bars help make it easy to strike a balance in your diet on the go. Larabars, Pure bars , SmartMonkey bars and ThinkOrganic bars are all healthy brands of raw bars that amazon sells and all worth a try . Experiment and see what flavors you like best , or make your own !

review/summary: Some GREAT Some HORRIBLE overall i'm HOOKED!!!
review/text: Tropical Fruit Tart<br />5 Stars<br />This bar is very refreshing with a wonderful fruit and citrus flavor and soft chewy texture.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough<br />2 Stars<br />I'm not a fan of this flavor. The bar would be much better without the chocolate chips that somehow leave a funny aftertaste.<br /><br />Coconut Cream Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Oh my I do love coconut, and this bar was better then I expected it to be. Wonderful texture and not too chewy. This would be a great replacement for the raspberry coconut zingers I'm addicted to!<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll<br />3 Stars<br />This one didn't blow me away or disappoint so I am giving it an average review. The bar was a little harder then I would have preferred and the Cinnamon flavor could have been stronger. It should just be called Cinnamon as it does not have any flavors that could hint as being a healthy bar flavored like a cinnamon roll. If you like cinnamon you will probably like this bar but if you are indifferent to cinnamon I would skip this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie<br />3 Stars<br />This one's ok... Good texture, not nearly the amount of cashew flavor I expected for something called "Cashew Cookie", and it almost had a stale flavor even though it was eaten well before the best by date.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip<br />5 Stars<br />This bar definitely hit my sweet tooth. Great texture, no funny aftertaste like some of the other chocolate Larabar flavors and I would definitely put this on the list of candy bar replacements!<br /><br />Pecan Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Not overwhelmingly sweet, great pecan pie flavor, perfect soft, slightly chewy texture.<br /><br />Lemon Bar<br />5 Stars<br />Very nice Lemon flavor and a wonderful chewy texture that reminds you of an actual Lemon Bar! The Lemon lingers in your mouth quite a while.<br /><br />Banana Bread<br />1 Star<br />This bar was bitter. There's only 3 ingredients: Almonds, Dates, and Unsweetened bananas. Well bananas are naturally sweet so what was so bitter in this bar? Some people might not find this as bad as I did, but I couldn't get past the first bite.<br /><br />Apple Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Another favorite flavor. It tastes like apple pie with a few nuts. It's just perfect.<br /><br />Ginger Snap<br />5 Stars<br />Wonderful Ginger snap cookie taste! This is probably the sweetest one I've tried. Good texture, chewy and crunchy, and delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter & Jelly<br />3 Stars<br />This bar had a great texture but only a so-so flavor. I would not purchase a full box of these bars, but I would pick it over some of the others if I had a limited choice.<br /><br />Key Lime Pie<br />5 Stars<br />This was a nutty bar, which is to be expected, but the subtle hint of lime was delightful. I could stand to use even more lime flavor but the soft chewy texture and lime flavor make this one of my favorites.<br /><br />UPDATE w/Additional Flavors:<br /><br />Blueberry Muffin<br />5 Stars<br />Oh, I think I've found a new favorite! This bar has a wonderfully rich blueberry flavor without being too sweet and it reminds me of a Blueberry Oatmeal Muffin.<br /><br />Chocalate Coconut Chew<br />3 Stars<br />As a huge fan of the Coconut Cream I had high hopes for this bar but after eating it the only thing I could say was "Where's the coconut?!" I definitley missed the coconut texture and flavor. The chocolate flavor of this bar however was not too sweet, not overpowering, and overall the bar will suffice for a chocolate lovers craving.

review/text: I like all of the Larabars that I have tried.  They taste good and are able to satisfy my appetite.  I do not understand why the bars can be purchased cheaper at Whole Paycheck (aka Whole Foods) for $1.35 and Walmart for $1.25 and they are more expensive per unit when purchased in a box of 16 at Amazon.  Depending on which Larabar you choose, the Amazon per unit price ranges from 1.35 for the Cherry to 1.83 for the chocolate per unit.  Amazon needs to adjust its price in order to be competitive in the market.

review/summary: Banana bread brownie?
review/text: Wow, I just had my first Larabar today after a long run, and I have been blown away.  As of late my preference has been for protein bars, but I had picked up a Larabar a few months ago just because it looked interesting.<br /><br />I tried the "banana cookie dough" flavor, since I'm a banana nut.  Unwrapping the package was difficult, though I've since found out that they have a multi-layer wrapper because there are no preservatives.  Once open, I was confronted with a raw looking rectangle of brown with pale chunks in it.  It looked moist and smelled phenomenal.  The first bite made me think "banana bread", and as I ate the rest of the bar I decided it wasn't quite like banana bread, but closer to that than a "cookie", in any case.  The pale chunks were the #1 ingredient - almonds.  The #2 and #3 ingredients were dates and bananas, respectively.  The #4 ingredient was.... nothing.  There are only 3 ingredients.  I actually flipped the wrapper over to see the continuation of the ingredients list before I realized that there was no more list!<br /><br />These bars are a little expensive for a non-protein energy bar, but the taste is like nothing you would expect from a brown rectangular smashed together food thing.  Its simply incredible, and now I have to go back and purchase the other flavors to try them out, too.

review/text: I am a health and fitness nut and I've tried about everything out there.  I love these bars as they are really filling and taste great (unless you are a sugar addict and need everything to have that super sweet calorie filling flavor!)  I also appreciate that I can buy cases of just one flavor at Amazon.com because the store where I've been buying them has 3 flavors per box and I prefer chocolate the most.  Whoever wrote the poor review about the high fat doesn't understand much about diet!  I've lost 20 pounds using these bars as a morning snack between meals combined with regular exercise and watching portion sizes.  Fat isn't the monster some think it is.. you need it and these bars provide a natural fat full of Omega 3 and Omega 6 along with a good mix of carbs and protein.  Thank you Lara Bar.

review/summary: short on ingredients, long on utter deliciousness
review/text: These are my favorite variety of Larabar.  If you like gingerbread (not gingersnaps or gingerbread cookies, mind you -- actual gingerbread, the kind that you can eat by the slice) than I am willing to bet that you will love these bars as much as I do.  The taste is exactly like that of freshly baked gingerbread; the texture is moist like gingerbread but crunchy because of the nuts the bar contains.  The crunchiness, in my opinion, doesn't detract a whit from the overall fabulousness of these bars -- in fact, I would say it adds to it.<br /><br />Finally (and this is true of all Larabars) the stunning brevity of the ingredient list bears noting.  Larabars contain no added sugar, no artificial flavoring or coloring, and no preservatives.  All of the sweetness and flavor (and there is just enough of the former and plenty of the latter) come from wholly natural, healthful sources.

review/text: I was on the lookout for granola bars that have ingredients that are more natural. I used to love Nature Valley bars, then I fell in love with the FiberOne bars, then I inhaled Balance bars. Now I think I've settled on Larabars, simply because they have such few ingredients and I can pronounce every single one of them. Even better, I can go to a regular grocery store and buy the ingredients, and if I'd want to spend more time in the kitchen, I could make them myself! (google for recipes, people really do make them themselves!)<br /><br />Love that Amazon sells them in bulk (they can get quite pricey, depending on which grocery store you go to).<br /><br />My favorite flavers are the Coconut Creme Pie, the Keylime Pie, the Carrot Cake, and the Cherry Pie. Soooo good! I don't leave the house without one or two of these in my bag :)

review/summary: Bars were moldy!
review/text: (NOTE: I purchased this box on July 8, 2012 -- not May 2012. Amazon must have used the date of a prior Larabar purchase.)<br /><br />I think Larabars are healthy; I've been eating them almost daily for years, but I like only a few flavors, and ginger snap is the best! But beware when they have a strange, sharp flavor (it tastes almost chemical to me)! This was the third box I have purchased that had this problem (out of about 8 boxes total). It always affects every bar in the box. I was able to get a refund for the first two boxes, but not this box from Amazon (I don't know why not), so I am going through the manufacturer (now General Mills), but it is not easy (I have to mail back all the wrappers I have).<br /><br />After finding mold on one of the bars, I had two of the bars tested by a food research company. I was told that the problem is the water content, the Aw, which was .717 on the moldy bar (from one lot) and .687 on the other bar (from a different lot), which tasted bad but had no visible mold (other bars in that box were later found to have mold as well). These bars still had more than 7 months before their expiration date.<br /><br />Here's a quote from the food researcher: "Pathogens cannot survive below water activity (Aw) 0.86 so food borne illness is not a risk below this Aw. Between Aw 0.60 and 0.70 the microorganisms of concern are xerophilic molds and osmophilic yeasts...In summary, the Lara Bar labeled "Bad" had an Aw high enough to support growth of mold and yeast. The other Lara Bar sample also had fairly high Aw, high enough to support growth of mold & yeast. As a standard practice, we target an Aw of less than or equal to 0.60 for all shelf stable products (with pH >4.2) in order to avoid growth of all pathogens and spoilage organisms. All manufacturers should be targeting an Aw of &#8804;0.65 unless they are adding preservatives."<br /><br />I don't know if I will give up on these bars yet, because when they do it right, they are really good!

review/summary: So glad I finally tried these
review/text: I have been wanting to try Larabars for over a year. Finally today I picked up a box at Sam's club (the only place even remotely close to me that carries them), and I couldn't be more pleased. The bar I tried today was Apple Pie. The ingredients in the Apple Pie bar are dates, almonds, apples, walnuts, raisins and cinnamon. That's it. All natural, real food. I will say that it does not look enticing, or actually even at all appealing, and the texture leaves something to be desired...but it tastes wonderfully natural and gives a nice energy boost. It will be perfect for before/after/during workouts, but has enough calories that if I am too busy to eat a meal it will suffice. Does it taste like apple pie? Only slightly. But people who aren't accustomed to eating apple pie really won't mind, or may not even notice.

To my great relief it tasted really nice. There is a lot of flavor for how few of ingredients there are.<br /><br />Also, I really liked the minimalistic ingredient list. My advice, just don't look at it when you eat it.

review/text: I have tried several flavors of Larabar and I like them all well enough, but the Ginger Snap is my absolute favorite. It is delicious and satisfying. Larabars are sweet, but a lot of bars taste too sweet to me. Larabars are less sweet than some so someone who wants a really sweet snack might prefer something different, but I believe anyone who likes the taste of ginger would enjoy this bar. It tastes like ginger spice cake. I love it.

review/text: Several people have written in to say that their Larabars were old and crumbly.  I just received a box of 16 Chocolate Coconut Chew Larabars and they are in date, moist, have a good consistency, and are delicious.  This is a perfect mid-morning or after workout snack.  I love that they are raw, vegan, Kosher, contain all-natural ingredients and have no processed sugar.  These taste better, are healthier, and have a better texture than most lines of exercise-oriented energy bars.

review/text: I'm in college so I was looking for an healthy snack to take to class.I wasn't sure about this product when I first tried them.Now, I love them. I admit your taste buds do have to adjust to the natural flavors, especially if you are use to other bars that have a lot of artificial ingredients.  The local Kroger's had these 10 for 10 and I have tried almost all the flavors. The apple pie, cashew cookie, and lemon are my favorites.

review/summary: Nice snack bar alternative!
review/text: Well, if you are following the "only eat processed foods with five ingredients or less" rule, this product, Larabar's "cherry pie" fits the bill.  There are three ingredients: dates, almonds, and cherries.<br /><br />As a sports snack, it has 200 calories (70 from fat), 5g protein, and 5g fiber.  It's not a high protein bar for muscle building, but it does have the calories for glycogen replacement.<br /><br />It's not really crumbly or melty, so it transports well.  And if you are looking for a gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, vegan snack, this may be for you.  Most of us will snarf it down in about 4 bites.  If you need something that takes longer to eat, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Best Tasting Fruit and Nut Bar I have ever eaten
review/text: Trying to find an alternative for breakfast, I stubled upon these Larabars. After deciding on the Apple Pie flavor, I found one of the best tasting alternatives to breakfast I have ever eaten. Each bite is massive amounts of apple taste. The bars are well spread with nuts but the fruit taste is where it is at. The only downside is that the bars are kinda small so you will have to eat multiples.

review/text: These are delicious, thick almonds (*with skin, which for me tend to get stuck in my teeth, so fyi) and they have a nice spice kick to them without being to much.<br /><br />I'm an athlete who is constantly looking for easy on the go snacks and fats - these cover that little two hour window for when something comes up at the last minute - be it working late or driving across town for something, etc.<br /><br />I live in Dallas TX and these arrived in the middle of the summer when it was 110 degree's outside.  I grabbed one fresh out of the box so they were hot and I later found then to be better hot and soft than at room temp. I would suggest giving that a shot. (I leave them in the car after a break at work and let them heat up that way, I have never microwaved them - I would imagine that would ruin them)

review/text: I love Larabars- I like to keep one on me in case I get super hungry when I'm out and about because the protein and fat content makes them very filling. Because I'm gluten intolerant and also do not eat highly processed foods, it can be pretty difficult to find something to eat away from home, but when I get really hungry I get ill anyway. Larabars have saved my butt more times than I can count- I like the coconut cream and peanut butter chocolate chip ones the best and they have a little less fat too!<br />Plus, only a few ingredients. Perfection!

review/text: I have been buying Larabars for some time now and I have to say, they are the best source of "good" calories, especially for someone who deals with changes in blood sugars.  The nuts provide fibre and the " good " fats, whereas the dates are a great source for energy on the go.  I love the new flavours ( Peanut butter chocolate chip and the chocolate chip brownie).  My old favourite still is the coconut chocolate chew--I am a huge fan.  They are so much better than any old chocolate bar--in fact, chocolate bars not even in the ballpark as far as a comparison!

review/text: I choose to follow a gluten-free, dairy-free diet because I have multiple sclerosis.  This product enables me to have my "sweets" without the consequences.  It's substantial & if I have two, I end up skipping a meal. (Not recommended, I know.)  The consistency is slightly moist, compact, heavy; the flavor is not overly sweet, peanut butter-y and fun (it's the only way I can describe it) when you get the chocolate chip.  If the bars had any more chips, they would overpower it.  I only wish it was a wee bit larger.  Just a wee bit because I go through three to four boxes every month.

review/summary: Carrot Cake
review/text: I just discovered a new flavor of Larabar:  Carrot Cake.  I love carrot cake, and this bar is awesome.  It tastes just like carrot cake.  The yummy, scrumptious ingredients of dates, almonds, walnuts, raisins, pineapple, unsweetened coconut, carrots, cinnamon, and extra virgin olive oil all put together is heavenly.  This is one of my favorite flavors of Larabars.<br /><br />I can't sing enough praises for Larabars:  good taste, healthy, convenient.  It's good to have a few (or a lot) on hand in case you get a little hungry or weak.<br /><br />And, oh, I must mention:  These bars are created and made in Colorado.  I know, that has nothing to do with the goodness of these bars.  But Colorado is my new favorite state, so I mentioned it.  The goodness of these bars are just as wonderful as Colorado is beautiful.  And if you know how breathtaking Colorado is, then you know I am comparing these bars to something awesome.  Awesome, healthy, tasty bars that are convenient.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like these type of bars.<br /><br />Carrot cake highly recommended if you like carrot cake.

review/text: I was surprised by these bars when they were provided as a snack while out on a sailing trip. These bars are soft & moist, and more like eating actual food than the typical nutrition bar. I am so tired of the bars that taste like sawdust, and am really tired of having to eat something dry and with oats if I want nutrition (mind you.. I actually like oats, but options are nice). I didn't consider myself a fan of dates, one of the main ingredients, but this is such a pleasent alternative that you will be serendipitously delighted.

review/summary: Can't live with out these!
review/text: Have to Love Lara bars!  The only raw, natural,delicious snack to be found widely at most groceries in our area, and in so many flavors!  No added sugar or salt!  They have only 3-5 ingredients each.  All raw (except the peanuts in the peanut butter flavors are roasted.) It is exciting to be able to have them in larger quantities at a significantly lower price.  Now we never run out!  I think I'm going to have to set them up on subscription to be automatically shipped monthly!  They arrive quickly and we take them everywhere and enjoy them.  Even my two year old loves them.  Perfect for when you are away from home or don't have time for a meal and don't want to consume something full of bad fats, sugar, and preservatives.  Three in our family are gluten intolerant.  It is very hard to find something gluten free when you are out and about.  These are naturally gluten free!

review/text: The bar is pretty good. Taste more like cinnamon than apple pie IMHO!!<br />The texture, to my surprise was pretty mushy, thick and had bits of almond throughout.<br />Very chewy and you can taste the real fruit inside. (just think of a few different dried fruits pressed together)<br />This was my first time trying bars like this as part of a new diet. I like the minimal ingredients used.(no chems)<br />I ate the Trio brand bars along side this one for comparison.<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because of personal preference. I like the more nutty, crunchy textures of the Trio brand.<br /><br />Overall, I think it was a good bar. Not high on cals pretty good on nutrients.<br />Looking for a good tasting vegan bar, this is a good one to try out.

review/summary: One of the better snack bars you'll find
review/text: I've now sampled four different varieties of LaraBar, and here's my main take on the lemon ones: if you like lemon squares, this is your bar.  The all-natural raw foods approach makes for a great snack bar - not over-sweetened, no sticky aftertaste, not too dry, and one bar was often the perfect mid-afternoon snack to carry me over until dinner - but the lemon flavor here is definitely not subtle.  I still enjoyed the box, but prefer the cherry pie or banana cookie flavors.

review/summary: Great Product, Great Taste
review/text: I read about the fat content on the Larabar site, which said: "What about the fat in L&Auml;RABAR? Plant-based fats are healthier than animal fats. The fat in L&Auml;RABAR comes primarily from nuts-all plant-based fats containing Omega 3 & 6 essential fatty acids, which have been proven to reduce LDL cholesterol and help protect the heart."  I read all the reviews before making this purchase and I was amazed at how misleading PEN PAL's, review was (they said: "LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES!").  It sounded scary.<br /><br />Olive oil is good for you, but no matter what, the calories from fat (9 calories per gram) are going to be the same whether it is from bad sources of fat or good sources.  The calories from this product are from good sources and that is what counts.  Everybody who has gotten to the point of good intelligence regarding managing their intake of food should be aware how to use good fats vs bad fats, good carbs vs bad carbs but this IS, in my estimation, a very healthy product and just as you would not put too much olive oil on your food, or overeat nuts, you won't binge on Larabars or anything else you know will have unwanted consequences.  I'd give these delicious bars a try and fit them into your food management routine any way you see fit!  It definitely goes in the good food category for sure.  Don't hate the fat, hate the lack of discipline and they are a tempting yummy. :)

review/text: I'm on the go and trying to keep healthy and fit by making sure I eat at regular intervals. I tried the "energy" bars and "nutrition" bars, but they all have fake sweeteners with that nasty aftertaste. Saw these in the grocery store and picked up a few different flavours. WOW!! All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />I have now tried most of the Larabar flavours, and these are my favourite - very simple 2-ingredients, but they go great together.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar.

review/summary: Still Love 'Em
review/text: I am a food bar junkie. I found these at Whole Foods about 6 months ago, and eat them regularly. I still havent got tired of them. I basically eat them as a meal supplement. I look for bars that taste good, are low in saturated fat, high in fiber, high in protein, and low in things like corn syrup and sodium. The Larabar product meets all these criteria. They are kind of unusual in their consistency though whic hmay turn some people off. They are quite dense in consistency, and some flavors also have a "sticky" consistency. The flavors are potent fresh and generally good. They taste like they are really made of the "flavor" on the label. Cherry taste like an actual cherry. Banana tastes like actual banana, etc.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Larabar is the best Food bar product, followed by Clif Bar, followed by PowerBar Harvest.

review/summary: Best LaraBar flavor yet!
review/text: This is my new favorite Larabar. My only gripe is that it's hard finding the new flavor in stores. I love Larabars in general because of their amazing ability to weave a few simple ingredients into great-tasting, portable snacks. There's no strange chemicals added, just fruit and nuts. They're my go-to snack to keep in my bag for those times when gluten-free food is hard to find. And they're the most reasonably priced of their class.<br /><br />The PB&J flavor is great because it combines the tart bite of their Cherry Pie flavor with the richness of peanut butter. If you can get used to the idea of a PB&J sandwich in bar form, it really will remind you of the original.<br /><br />This flavor has only 4 ingredients, no added sugar (sweetened with dates) and a respectable 6g of protein (they range from 3-6g, I believe).

review/summary: Great Natural Taste!
review/text: I've reviewed a lot of these products, and most have some common flaws: Bad, "unnatural," or chemical-like taste (especially in the metallic after-taste), woefully stale, cardboard-like texture, high fat content, and relatively high price.<br /><br />Fortunately, Lara-Bars are perhaps the best tasting line of "nutritional bars" available. The apple pie version is nicely chewy, with a taste of rolled oats, cinnamon, raisin, and, of course, apple, though it's not as intense or satisfying a fruit flavor as their Cherry Pie bar.  The apple hits you especially in the aftertaste, which is very satisfying.  Perhaps a bit on the dry side, but neither boring or cloying, and without that awful artificial taste mentioned above.<br /><br />The ingredient list is all one needs to read to discover the "secret" of Lara's natural taste:<br />Dates, almonds, unsweetened apples, walnuts, raisins, cinnamon. That's it! This is absolutely unheard of in type of food! Go to any comparable product (e.g., Cliff, Balance, Promax, South Beach, etc.) and you will find a veritable mine of vitamin and mineral additives.  For that reason alone (OK, and the concomitant wonderfully natural taste), these stand leagues above the competition.<br /><br />Does this reliance on natural foods cost you in nutrition?  I don't know--that's one for doctors and dietitians. However, I can list the nutritional values here:<br /><br />In one bar, you ingest the following:<br /><br />One serving (45 grams) provides 180 Calories--90 of them from fat;  10 g, Total Fat, of which only 1 gram is saturated fat,  4 grams are monounsaturated, and 4.5 grams are polyunsaturated (no trans fat, although, interesting enough, those grams add only to 9.5);  NO Cholesterol; 5mg of Sodium: 280mg, Potassium; 23 grams, Total Carbohydrate. Of which 4 grams are fiber and 17 grams, sugar (all that fruit), and 4 grams of protein. IT also provides 1 gram of Omega-3 and 4 grams of Omega 6 fatty acids. The fruit content sums to 1 serving of fruit according to the USDA food guide pyramid (I'm reading all this off the wrapper).<br /><br />Vitamins: Vitamins A and C --0% (of the percent daily values, based on a 2,0000 calorie diet), Vitamin E -10%,  Calcium--6%, Iron--8%, Thiamin (B1) --4%, Riboflavin (B2)-8%, Niacin (B3)--4%, Vitamin B6--4% Folate--4%, Zinc--4%, Copper--15%, Magnesium--10%.<br /><br />Some additional information can be found at--where-else--larabar.com, a nice little website where interested foodies can read about the company philosophy. For those not so inclined to visit, I offer an excerpt:<br /><br />"Humm Foods, the creator of L&Auml;RABAR, firmly believes that the foundation of a healthy mind, body and spirit is derived from what you eat. And what you eat is healthiest and most satisfying when it's in a whole, natural state...<br /><br />HUMM FOODS [note: this is contrasted with "junk foods"] ... resonate with energy in a whole, natural state. When consumed, they cause you to feel vibrant and alive when consumed, they cause you to feel vibrant and alive.<br /><br />You can expect an unmistakable urge to humm after every L&Auml;RABAR  you eat.<br /><br />Let the humming begin!"<br /><br />Writing like that tells me these people are--and I hate using this overused word--PASSIONATE about their product. Give it a try!

review/summary: Great for hiking or breakfast on the go
review/text: These bars are my favorite trail food. One makes a good breakfast. Two make a decent lunch while hiking. Not as sticky as Powerbars and Cliffbars, although I like those too.<br /><br />Others have commented that they are high in fat, calories and carbohydrates. What's wrong with that? These are not rice cakes, they are energy bars. The ingredients are: dates, almonds, unsweetened cherries. No added sugar. Non-gmo, gluten-, dairy- and soy-free. Vegan and kosher. No trans fat. One bar has only 3% of your recommended daily value of saturated fat. Healthier than lots of alternatives.<br /><br />Cherry and Lemon are great. Apple is almost as good. Pecan is just so-so. Haven't tried the other flavors yet.<br /><br />It's hard for me to believe that mold could grow on these because they are pretty dry.  Maybe it was crystalized sugar? My box from Amazon is labelled best by 12/2008, and they are all fine.<br /><br />I like these so much that I signed up for regular Amazon deliveries through Subscribe and Save.  Now I won't have to depend on Costco for a steady supply.  Keep up the good work, Humm Foods!

I LOVE that- all I taste are gently sweet dried fruit and nuts, not sugary crap that gives me a tummy ache. All natural stuff. I think for many people with low ratings of this product regarding taste, that is their beef- "no flavor" when they are used to super sweet processed taste. These bars are great for people with any sort of intolerance for soy or gluten and make great snacks after a workout.

review/summary: Cherry Pie Larabar Reminds Me of Childhood
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ENWSBW">Larabar, Bar Cherry Pie, 1.7-Ounce (16 Pack)</a><br /><br />Oh My!!!  The Cherry Pie Larabar reminds me of the cherry pies my mother used to make.  They are not overly sweet (like the store-bought pies made these days) and the tart cherry flavor really comes through.  I must admit I had my doubts when I first opened the wrapper, because the Larabar did not look very appealing.  Don't let looks fool you...this bar is delicious!!<br /><br />I first purchased a variety of Larabars at a local store to try them out.  Once I found the Cherry Pie bars, I decided to purchase a whole box of them through Amazon to save money.  An unexpected bonus was that the bars I received through Amazon.com were much softer (and fresher) than those bought locally.

review/summary: Gluten-Free!
review/text: I love these! These are soo good...even my toddler loves them. I always keep a few in the diaper bag for snacks on the go. I especially appreciate that they are gluten free. I myself am not gluten free, but my MIL is, and it is hard to keep healthy snacks (other than fruit) in the house that are gluten free. The Cherry Pie flavor is our favorite!

review/summary: Healthy Paleo/Raw/YUMMY Snack
review/text: I got into Larabars, because I am trying to eat more natural, less packaged food.  Yes Larabars come in a package, but they do not have any preservatives, chemicals, or ingredients whose names I cannot pronounce.  Each flavor has 4 or 5 ingredients.  It's refreshing to read a package label that you can pronounce, understand, and visualize each ingredient.<br /><br />My favorite flavors are Coconut (SO YUMMY), Lemon (tastes like a lemon square, very tart), and Banana (tastes freakishly like banana bread).<br /><br />These bars will satisfy your sweet tooth and keep you feeling full.
