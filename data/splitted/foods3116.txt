review/text: I'd never heard of Glutino before. I bought a snack pack of these pretzels at a health food store. They cost a fortune. I was shocked when Amazon had them by the case. What a great find for my son on the GFCF diet. They taste great. No different than other pretzels. We bought a whole case. We love them! Thanks so much Glutino.

review/summary: Potato-y taste, bad texture
review/text: In my opinion these are a poor substitute for a "real" pretzel. They have a potato-y taste and an odd texture. They're crunchy when you first bite into them. Then they quickly dissolve; not very quickly, just more quickly than "real" pretzels.<br /><br />So far Snyder's gluten free pretzels are the closest thing to "real" pretzels I have tried yet. I just wish they were made in twists.

review/text: These pretzels have been a wonderful treat since discovering I am gluten sensitive, but at 6 grams of fat a serving you need to be careful of how many you eat!  Would rate them at five stars if they contained less fat, but then they might not be as yummy...

review/summary: Glutino Gluten Free Pretzels
review/text: If you Celiac or just perfer gluton-free, these pretzels are a good substitution for both other pretzels and other types of snacks. Despite what O'Reilly used as a tip at the end of his show, gluten-free usually mean more "carbs" for a similar serving.<br /> But as a Celiac, varity is truly the spice of life. Celiacs first response to diagnosis is to see all the walls between them and what used to be their favorite foods. Celiacs in this day and age are so much luckier than previous generations. Firstly, because Doctors are running the proper blood tests to diagnosis gluten-intolerance much more frequently. It might appear as if more folks are stricken with this these days, but I am convinced that is just because of this increased knowlegde by the Doctors.<br /> As to these pretzels. They may or may not strike you as better than your previous favorite, but you now understand that the previous favorite were the cause of "palor", malnutrision and gastro issues. So you must resign yourself to exploring the every expanding gluten-free offerings.<br /> These are not your Philly soft pretzels, but they make a great salty and crunchy "chip" with which to scoop up some hummus, peanutbutter, etc.<br /> Also, this size bag and the Amazon price for a box of these every month or two is one of the most affordable ways to enjoy these healthful snacks. They also good straight from the bag, but it easy to get carried away.<br /> My wife and I found out about my Celiac 5 years ago. It makes you read everylabel on every product you bring into your house. You may even go as far a throwing out all porous (i.e. wooden) utensils, your old toaster and several other things and can't be guaranteed sanitazied.<br /> You learn to trust mostly the food you make yourself, but when you learn that you can trust Glutino, and you can, subscribe to Amazon for regularly scheduled deliveries of all types of life giving goodies like the Pamela's Pancake Mix which go great with chopped, toasted walnuts, blueberries and a couple of raisins although, most maple, agava and other syrups are still safe.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8HY">Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists, 14.1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: These are the BEST gluten free pretzels
review/text: My wife and children are gluten intolerant and we searched for good pretzels for a long time. We finally found Glutino a few years ago and then began the quest of buying them at a reasonable price. Amazon S&S is the perfect place to find them at a good price per bag or price per ounce compared to a lot of grocery stores.<br /><br />These pretzels are so good I usually don't buy regular pretzels anymore and just eat a couple of these when I want to eat pretzels.<br /><br />If I had to make any negative comment it would be that they could probably use a little more salt.

review/summary: Wonderful Treat - Better Than Non-Gluten Pretzels
review/text: Not only is this snack delicious but it's one of the first items to be even better than regular pretzels that have wheat.  The recipe produces a light and very crispy pretzel, doesn't get stale after leaving it a month in ziploc like other pretzels.  Everyone that I've shared with agrees with me.  So it is very expensive though for those who cannot eat gluten, it's a must have.  I buy it by the case and sparingly share with others!

review/text: These are my favorite of the gluten free pretezels but they are expensive. So I decided to order a case from Amazon. I was VERY disappointed when the package arrived. They sent the regular pretzels and further the order said no returns. I called and they did refund my money but did not offer to send me the right product. I would rather have had the sesame pretzel rings I ordered. I won't order anything else bulk from here. I have had such good luck ordering from Amazon I was really disappointed with this order and Amazon :(  I gave a one star on the review because I did not get the product I ordered. The pretzels are a 5 star in my book.

review/text: I recently discovered these at a local Walmart priced at about $5 or $6 a bag (about 4 servings).  I decided to check on Amazon and loved the lower price.  A case of 12 bags for about $31.  I have not been diagnosed with Celiac disease (so far), but I am very sensitive to gluten and to oats (migraines, intestinal pains, diarrhea).  These pretzels have never once caused a reaction of any kind , even if I pig out on an entire bag in one weekend.  The only negative thing I could say is that the fat count in higher than I'd like. 8 grams for 32 pretzels.  Salt content is moderately high at 540mg, but they are pretzels after all.  I highly, highly recommend these pretzels.

review/text: Oh, these are yummy.  Even my gluten-eating family loves them and says they're better than "real" pretzels.<br /><br />They're my dog's favorite snack too.  The only thing that could make them better is if they came in a honey mustard flavor.

review/text: My daughter is gluten/casein free and these are our standard lunchbox snack.  Foods can be limited since most schools won't allow you to pack peanut products in lunchboxes due to peanut allergies in other children.  The Glutino Pretzels are the perfect thing.<br /><br />The taste is very close to a regular pretzel--perhaps more like a slightly stale regular pretzel.<br /><br />The subscribe and save option here on amazon makes these significantly less expensive than they are in stores.

review/summary: Where have all the pretzels gone?
review/text: I recently purchased the 20-pack of 2.6 oz. bags of Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists. They are excellent and my family agrees! The 2.6 oz. bag makes it easy to control portions for those who (like me) are on a restricted diet. Unfortunately, when I tried to re-order within the last week, they are not available or no longer stocked. Upon searching for other suppliers, I found a few who have these available. However, they are available at a higher price than on Amazon. I already consider these great tasting pretzels to be a splurge item - if you do the math you find they are a little pricey for a snack item, even at Amazon's price. I truly hope these Glutino gluten-free pretzels will soon become available. I had planned to buy them again and again. They are a good-tasting, crisp and crunchy, very satisfying snack food.

review/text: I was born and raised in the Kansas City area and now live in southern Missouri.  Charlie Bryant (the original owner) retired in the late 40's, I believe, and his brother, Arthur, purchased the business.  Their restaurant was across the street from the Kansas City Athletics baseball stadium, which has long been torn down.  I love their original sauce because it isn't so sticky sweet like most are.  Arthur Bryant's is true, original Kansas City barbecue sauce.

review/summary: Wish you could make your own package
review/text: I was very hesitate on buying this but I thought why not give it a shot. I am a HUGE ice cream fan. I go through a half gallon every 3 days :). SO I did end up buying this package and as I thought the vanilla was pretty good, diffidently filling. The strawberry and banana I am not a huge fan of. I wish you could make your own mix and match. I would of much rather of had the chocolate and peanut butter. To give the vanilla a little more flavor, I have thrown in PB2 (bell plantation peanut butter which I am a huge fan of) I have also taken a chocolate vita muffin, made it into pieces, and mix it into the ice cream. The combination is to die for and it is still low calories! I think I may end up buying the chocolate ice cream. I would recommend the vanilla ice cream, however, not the strawberry.<br />~Caitlin~

review/text: This stuff is great. It tastes enough like ice cream to satisfy any but the most fussy and unrealistic of eaters. I've read that it tastes like whey protein. I don't know what whey protein tastes like but if it tastes like this then it's some mighty good stuff. This hits that 'cold and sweet' spot that the best cold deserts hit. I love it. BUT I am outraged at the price hike of over NINE DOLLARS for the 10-pack. I'm looking into alternatives. You can save about 0.40 per carton if you buy the six-oack - execept for the mint chocolate chip - but the price hike is still an outrage.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0894803123">Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream & Dessert Book</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0DMME">KIND PLUS, Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: A full pint of icy ice cream for under 140 calories
review/text: The taste, the strawberry banana - you can taste a mild banana flavor throughout the pint.  I would have preferred no banana and all strawberry but the banana is so mild I don't mind.  The vanilla maple you can taste the maple flavor throughout the pint, which I don't really like.  I would have preferred a vanilla flavor (don't even taste vanilla in this one just maple) or combining the maple with an oatmeal or brown sugar or something else.<br />This product though is great if you like to eat an entire pint of slightly icy ice cream.  As for the packaging, I had mine deleivered to NJ in August.  Granted we are having a cool summer but the products were still frozen upon receipt.  The only downside to the packaging is they use styrofoam peanuts (I hate) and the box the six cartons comes in looks like it can hold 12 (why not use a smaller box, no peanuts or put 12 in one box without the peanuts?).

review/summary: Great Product; finicky cat;  I don't get to eat wild salmon
review/text: (ASIN: B0012KB4X4) All of the wild salmon entrees are terrific.  Cotton simply doesn't like the taste of 'wild,' if there is one.  I think that, in this case, it means stronger flavor.  (He doesn't like herring, sardines, or  sometimes mackerel, either.)  So it is his loss; the gain goes to those other cats out there with more advanced palettes.<br />Cottie is a one-year old, for all intents and purposes still a kitten.  As a Jewish mother, I had hoped that with age, his taste buds would approve more foods, but as of now they haven't, so either first impressions have stuck with him, or he just doesn't like these flavors -- you know, the ones with aromas that curl your nose hair and really stink up the room the minute the lid is removed.  Periodically,  I try to give him Fancy Feast Wild Salmon Florentine, but he so far proves to me the immovable object.  (I have also tried the Fancy Feast Wild Salmon Tuscany (ASIN: B0012KH0LE) and Primavera (ASIN: B001STX0ZO),all purchased from Amazon.<br />I did try fooling him, once, and I am the one who got the short end on that one.  He loves Fancy Feast tuna with cheese.  I mixed some of that into the wild salmon.  Which not only did not do the trick, but Cotton refused to eat that favorite for a very long while, suspecting that I was trying to trick him again.  It is really strange when you see your cat eyeballing his dinner in any strange way; this one took the cake!<br />Just don't let his intractability ruin your cat's chance to enjoy something special.

review/summary: Classic vanilla, reliable results, in large economy size
review/text: Every so often I have used other brands of vanilla for all the usual purposes but I always come back to the predictability of Nielsen-Massey.  My uses range from flavoring oatmeal and whipped cream to baked goods. I am also on a limited income so cheaper brands always exert a siren call. Big mistake. N-M is simply the best.<br /><br /> I almost removed a star because when using the plastic bottle the 32 oz. extract comes in, there is no way to avoid the neck and cap getting crudded up with some of the vanilla which seems both a waste and poor design, so here's what I do. I decant a few ounces into a glass cruet (the kind you would put olive oil or vinegar into) and dollup it out a bit at a time. No mess that way.<br /><br />I think the smell of vanilla is one of the nature's greatest gifts, too. A few drops well applied can make a room smell wonderful.

review/summary: McCormicks vs Nielsen-Massey
review/text: My first order of Nielsen-Massey was a small bottle to compare it against the brand that we've used since I was a child (McCormick's).  I was hesitant at first but had heard really great things about the flavor of the Nielsen-Massey brand.<br /><br />Over the Thanksgiving Holiday we had several occasions to use Nielsen-Massey in our dishes.  After 22 desserts (we have a huge family gathering at Holidays) everyone kept commenting that the desserts were better than they've ever been in the past.  No one but me and my mother knew that we'd change only the one ingredient in all of the different pies, meringues, cakes, cookies, cheesecakes and sweet breads.<br /><br />I am a BIG cr&egrave;me br�l&eacute;e fan and tried my conventional recipe with the other vanilla extract and there was an amazing flavor difference.  Even though the flavor is wonderful with Nielsen Massey Vanilla I still prefer actual vanilla beans to extract in my cr&egrave;me br�l&eacute;e, but Nielsen Massey will more than suffice in a pinch or with people who aren't quite the fanatic that I am.<br /><br />Incidentally, I did receive the 32oz bottle as advertised.  Not the 4oz as I've seen complained about below.<br />**update** The 32oz that I purchased was Sold by: SimplyBeautiful

review/summary: Imitation is sacrilege
review/text: This vanilla is quite possibly the best I've ever had. Our homemade ice cream is quickly becoming the favorite at family gatherings, home-baked goods are so much more robust in flavor, and my home made egg-nogg has become a year-round specialty. This vanilla is what my great grandma used in her cooking, and I can see why. Quality is the #1 priority with Nielsen-Massey, and it shows in the goods you will undoubtedly find excuses to produce. Plus this is the biggest bottle I could find, and it will last me for quite some time! Stop reading already and click add to cart!

review/summary: Madagascar Vanilla
review/text: I am always searching out good products to elevate my cooking efforts.  So, when I watch cooking shows with my favorite food network chefs, I pay attention to their equipment and the products they use.  I saw Ina Garten using Nielsen-Massey vanilla, among a few other of their products on her shelf.  So, I ordered it to give it a try and it is just wonderful.  This vanilla wins, handsdown over the usual supermarket offerings.  You literally can taste the vanilla in all the baked goods.  It's taste specific.  This is a smooth and very fragrant vanilla and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: This makes some great baked goods! I'm no baking expert but I can follow a recipe pretty well. So far I've used it in chocolate chip cookies and waffles. I think people are right and saying that you should scale down the amount of vanilla needed. I've been using exactly what was on the recipe and I get just a slight alcohol aftertaste. If you smell the vanilla right out of the bottle, it is clear it's the vanilla you are tasting. It's not unpleasant and I don't think anybody would really notice.

review/text: This is the only vanilla we buy; it's relatively cheap and just tastes like vanilla in bourbon. It's a bit bitter, but that's normal with a good vanilla product. If you want something with more sweetness, try the paste. We use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000W0GQQ">Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste.</a> in anything that's light-coloured where we'd like to see the flecks of vanilla beans

review/summary: Vanilla Lover
review/text: I love Vanilla. I add it to (practically) everything, and this is, by far, the best vanilla extract on the market. Rich and decadent, this vanilla extract is the perfect addition for cookies, breads, yogurts, frostings, cakes, etc.<br /><br />Imitation vanilla extract is not worth purchasing--buy the real stuff, and buy this stuff. The 32-ounce bottle is a better deal than buying it in smaller bottles, and it won't go bad quickly (as an alcohol). Simply store it in a cool, dry place, and refill your smaller bottle as needed.<br /><br />Another favorite of mine is the Nielsen-Massey Vanilla Bean Paste--add it to frostings for an extra punch of vanilla seed specks! (It can also replace vanilla extract in any recipe.)

This is the same thing for way less tham half price, and they deliver it to my door.  What more can I say.  Thanks Amazon

review/summary: utterly delicious
review/text: This vanilla makes all the difference in the flavoring of anything it dives into.  I would highly recommend it even if it sounds a bit pricey when compared to normal grocery store brands.  The vanilla taste is pungent and makes whatever you are adding it to even better than you could want.<br /><br />I was thrilled it came in the 32 oz. size bottle because with the pourer it is easy to use and there is enough I didn't feel I had to limit my use of it.<br /><br />This is the kind of product that once you've tried it you'll be unable to use any other brand again.  Fabulous results await if you'll give into the temptations of Madagascar!!!!

review/text: After reading all the rave reviews about Nielsen-Massey vanilla, I purchased the 32 oz. for my Thanksgiving pie baking and Christmas cookie baking.  I must say I was disappointed, and feel that the vanilla I purchase at Sam's Club is just as good or perhaps better.  This didn't add anything extra to any of my baked goods, but didn't hurt them either.  I would say it's just another vanilla, but way overpriced.  I won't be buying it again.

When our big bottle of Mexican vanilla ran out I ordered this one and was a bit disappointed. It just doesn't taste as good, and has a detectable alcohol aftertaste. I'll use it, but we've asked one of our friends to get us another bottle of the Mexican vanilla next time they are visiting family south of the border.

review/text: These cakes are quite tasty and similar to the commercially available Zingers, only about half of the size per cake. Each one is about four bites worth, a nice expenditure if you have reserve points but not filling if you are hungry for sweets.  Oh, these are available at about $3.50 per box (three costing you $10.50) in Stop and Shop and most supermarkets. Amazon charges double. I don't know about you, but I work hard for my money and cannot see paying twice what is it worth!!!

I got them as a gift, so I didn't try any of them, but it was odd giving a gift where it didn't seem like they were anything special, like I'd bagged up some licorice jelly beans from the grocery store or something, big woop...so I was disappointed.  And because they were a gift I had no idea what they tasted like.  So were they really jelly bellys?  Who knows?  I felt silly giving them though.
