review/text: I adore this product! Best milk replacement I have found, since I cannot tolerate dairy or soy. Mix it with a hand blender and refrigerate overnight for best results. It makes your coffee smooth and delicious, is great on cereal, and good for baking. Has a sweet taste with a hint of a cake batter flavor.

review/summary: Works great for on the go where they don't sell rice milk
review/text: My son is allergic to regular milk and soy milk.  So it's Rice milk or nothing.  Where possible we always buy Rice Dream, but on the road that can be difficult.<br /><br />This works really well for travel and stays mixed.<br /><br />The only note is that it has to be mixed really good.  Putting some in a juice cup and just shaking will not mix it.  You need to make a pitcher and stir it up with a whisk until all the chunks are gone.  Once mixed it does not separate.

review/summary: Great alternative to regular milk
review/text: This product, the regular ORIGINAL kind - no special flavor; worked really well.  It is best to blend it in a blender.<br />I found it to be too sugary with 1 cup to 1/2 gallon.  So I diluted it to 1/2 cup powder for 1/2 gallon.  you will have to mix in two batches as it will overflow your blender.<br />But with it diluted, I found the consistancy to be similar to skim milk or 1% milk.  And no lumps or frothing like other reviews herein.  It also keeps in the fridge longer than regular milk, and the canisters keep fresh since it's a powder form.<br />Good luck and enjoy.

review/summary: Easy and Smooth But Not Nutritious
review/text: My 1 year old son is allergic to milk and soy and our pediatrician put him on rice milk.  We were traveling to Mexico and couldn't confirm that rice milk was available there (it was!) and I didn't want to travel with a week's supply of cartons of rice milk from here so I read the reviews and decided to try this rice milk powder.  We got it, mixed it with warm water and shook hard, and my son drank it from the bottle!  And then I looked at the nutritional value - no fat and no protein - and was completely deflated.  Basically, flavored water which is great for adults but not so great for my growing baby.  What we ended up doing is mixing it 1/2 and 1/2 with mixed powdered baby formula to give it fat and protein and it worked beautifully.  This rice milk powder is sweet so it masks the not sweet baby formula.  It was easy to travel with since I just had to travel with cartons of powder.  When we were out and about I pre-measured both powders to make 8 ounce bottles and just had to add the hot water and shake hard!

review/summary: Great taste, no waste
review/text: I love that I can mix just the amount I need. I got tired of throwing out 1/2 cartons of the regular rice milk.  Not only is it cheaper to begin with, but I also save money by not having the waste. Plus it's easy to take with me on trips.<br /><br />I haven't experienced much problem with mixing. I use a little warm water at first, shake it really well, then top off with really cold water. It's perfect for using on cereal and for baking. Any lumps aren't an issue for me because I don't tend to drink it straight anyway. However, if I did, I'd be more likely to do it with this because the flavor is actually quite good - much better than what I've experienced in the carton.

review/text: I bought this recently for my 2 yr old who needs to drink rice milk.  Needless to say it was a waste of money.  It took me almost 30 mins to mix it with my hand mixer to get it into a drinkable constistancy.  Otherwise it was very, very clumpy.  Then my son refused to drink it, it must be disgusting, as I had tried other brands and never had an issue before.

review/summary: Better than Milk Rice powder
review/text: The product is a great way to wean your child off formula once they are past a year old.  I mix 1/2 organic milk with 1/2 of the rice powder so that when my daughter gets a cold she is not limited to cows milk which produces extra phlem that they don't need when they're that little.  Too difficult for a baby to expel that junk. So, when baby gets sick I'll use just the rice milk until she is over the cold. Two downsides to the rice milk is that it's too sweet and it's not organic.

review/text: This beverage claims to be better than milk.  That simply is just not true.  The product just does not have that rich, creamy, milky taste.  Also, it's a pain in the ass to have to stir it.  I've never had to stir milk.  Not only that- it's more expensive than milk!  The only thing it has going for it is shelf life.  Maybe they mean if you leave the milk next to this in your hot pantry for a week, this will be better.  Okay, I will concede that point.  I guess "Better Than Spoiled Milk" just didn't have the same ring to it.

This is a very high quality product, it seems, compared to other dog foods. It is not watery and doesn't stink to high heaven. We're vegetarians, so low quality meat makes me nauseated, but this product is okay in that regard. It's just not my dog's favorite. We only buy the lamb Pet Guard now.

review/summary: Wow. Surprisingly tasty.
review/text: I've been all-around impressed with Teeccino, and the multi pack is the way to go. I expected something that was a bad imitation of coffee, kinda like the Tofurky of beverages or something. Instead, this is just some tasty darn stuff on it's own merits. Nice balanced flavors, with a natural mild sweetness, like the best coffee has. Not acidic, not bitter, but strong and interesting. Wakes up my brain and tongue, just as I'd hoped. The flavor is stable, and doesn't taste stale after a while like coffee does. I can work on a large tumbler all day and it's still fresh.<br /><br />Easy to make. I use it in a Bodum travel press. The grounds actually make a tasty second cup, if you want, but only one. Fits nicely into your regular coffee ritual without any fuss. Strongly recommended. It's a little pricey, but far preferable to Any other option I've tried, and worth the price to me.

review/summary: It's not coffee, but I like it just as much as coffee
review/text: I bought a bag of Mediterranean Java at my NFS yesterday to try, and I think it tastes great with the same "mouth feel" as coffee. I even get a bit of a coffee head buzz from it, but it has no caffeine. I had been using those instant grain coffee substitutes like Roma and Cafix, and they are kind of watery with a taste that is no better than just OK. The difference is that with those instant substitutes, I am fully aware that I am depriving myself of real coffee, but the Teeccino is just something good and different, but not a sacrifice.<br /><br />I just ordered a 3-pack of Teeccino in 11-oz bags from Amazon since I plan to drink this stuff as long as they keep making it. With Amazon's lower price, free shipping, and no sales tax, I save about 33% over what it costs to buy it locally. Thanks, Amazon.<br /><br />ETA 4/19/2010. I ordered the $12.95 (includes shipping) sample pack from the Teeccino website and got it two days later in TN from CA. It includes packs of all ten varieties and each pack makes a quart of full-strength brew. Some of the flavors I really didn't like, so it was a lucky accident that I randomly picked my favorite of all ten, Mediterranean Java, the first time I bought an 11-oz bag. I don't like most flavored coffee, so I didn't like flavored Teeccino any better, but that is no slam against Teeccino in particular since some people love something like Amaretto in a hot drink. Anyway, my advice is to buy the sampler, then get your 3-packs of whatever you like best from Amazon.

review/summary: LOVE this coffee substitute
review/text: For YEARS, I have been a coffee snob, preferring Starbucks to any other brands.  Yet, my health issues have made it very clear that coffee and I must part ways.  I searched for all kinds of coffee substitutes online and read honest reviews before deciding to purchase the Mediterranean Java Teeccino at my local Sprout's.  At $8.29/bag, I knew I was taking quite a risk, but...it was totally worth it!  I enjoy Teeccino guilt-free without the unhealthy consequences of coffee.  I sure do miss that caffeine rush, but I sleep better now, my moods are more even, and I have more energy in the day as opposed to the highs and lows that coffee has done to me.  My coffee addiction did a number on my teeth, on my gut, and on my mental health.  I finally feel like I am almost free from this addiction!!!  Teeccino is a wonderful replacement for coffee and I don't have to feel guilty drinking it (though I'm going to try and find a better deal on it from now on).<br /><br />To be fair, not everyone agrees.  My husband thinks it smells and tastes like paint.  My hopes were dashed with the smell as the first pot brewed, but the taste is very full-bodied like coffee and I love it.  Can't please 'em all!  So, we just take turns using the coffee pot.  Works for us :D

review/summary: I'm Sold!
review/text: My teeccino sampler, which I purchased from the teeccino site for $12.99 -- free Priority Mail shipping, arrived quickly. I began my taste testing with the medium roast Java: Using a drip coffee maker, I used a slightly rounded tablespoon and 12 oz of filtered water in a clean drip coffee maker. The result was a beefy, highly competitive coffee-like drink, very much like the real thing. A rounded tsp of sugar and very little cream was all I needed to make this a respectable alternative to coffee. That's saying a lot for me; before I ditched  coffee, about 8 years ago, I used 3 to 4 tsp of sugar per mug and lots of cream.  This drink doesn't need that: It would actually be very easy for me to learn to drink this black. If, however, your palate is stuck on "high-test-coffee-only" mode, don't even THINK about trying this; it's NOT coffee, but this particular flavor is definitely running a close second. On the other hand, if you're trying to wean yourself off caffeine, do buy this Java and make a blend of 3/4 coffee and 1/4 Java -- and gradually increase the Java portion until you have completely eliminated the coffee. So far, I've also tried the Chia, Original, and Hazelnut flavors but didn't care for any of them. BOTTOM LINE: Java teeccino is a definite keeper!

review/text: I've been drinking Teeccino for a couple of years now and really like it.  I have tried other coffee substitutes in the past and never been able to change over, healthy or not.  Teeccino is different.  It is not only good for me, it tastes good, too.  One thing in particular that I like about Teeccino over coffee is the fact that Teeccino leaves no residue or after taste in my mouth.  It doesn't cause bad breath, either.  Over all a very good and very affordable alternative to coffee.

review/summary: Starbucks Snob LOVES Teeccino Java!
review/text: My drip coffee of choice is Starbucks decaf espresso roast, ground for my flat bottom filter and brewed in my Mr. Coffee 4-cup coffee maker.  I am no sissy when it comes to how much grind I use in my brew either; I make it per the package directions.  I've taken note over time that whenever I drink coffee I just don't feel so great.  I decided to give the Teeccino Caffeine-Free Herbal Coffee, Mediterranean Java a try after reading A LOT of online reviews.  Besides, I met the Teeccino folks at Natural Products Expo West in March 2011 and I really liked the idea of the Teeccino brand.  I am sitting here sipping my Java now as I write this.  Love it, love it, love it!  To be clear, it does NOT taste like Starbucks espresso roast.  This is a taste all its own. It is GOOD in my opinion.<br /><br />UPDATE 06/05/2012<br />I have tried this hot, cold, black, with half-and-half, with milk & orange liquor, and with half-and-half & orange liquor. It ALL has tasted good to me!  If you are looking for a natural ALTERNATIVE to coffee I think this fits the bill!

And like such things as coffee, or beer, it may be a bit of an acquired taste; as it is a complex yet smooth blend of flavors.  The good news is it's not fattening or acidic or full of caffeine.  I like it iced latte or hot.

I absolutely love it  --  if you are looking for alternative this is an excellent choice  --

review/text: Just love this!  Trying to keep my acidity down and this does not make me miss coffee anymore.  I was a true coffee addict and since drinking this I broke the habit!  I had a sip of coffee the other day and it did nothing for me.  It reminds me of a product I used to drink as a child called Orzo Bimbo but this is stronger and more robust. Love it and reccomend it.  I put one scoop per four cups of water in my coffee maker.  No milk and no sugar and it's wonderful.

review/summary: Only one our dog can eat
review/text: We have a German Shepard/ Akita mix with food allergies to just about everything.  This is the only food she can eat without a reaction.  Natural Balance now has a very similar limited ingredient, duck and sweet potato product, but for some reason, that one makes the dog's stomach run.  The biggest cons with this product is price and availability.  We have to order it online because there are no local retailers that carry this product, and having such an expensive dog food shipped only makes the price harder to handle.  But the dog's gatta eat!

review/text: Our dog had a groin rash.  On the advice of our breeder we switched him to duck and potato.  He was previously on a grain based dog food.  His rash has gone away and his skin is healthy.  When we first got this, I tried mixing in the new dog food with the old, but he picked out and ate only the new dog food.  He actually enjoys eating this.  Highly recommended.

If you're trying to keep your dog on a single protein for allergy reasons, this food fits the bill.<br /><br />The downside is that it takes Amazon FOREVER to ship the product.....please plan on 2-3 weeks to receive, even when Amazon shows it is in stock.  Even though I plan ahead, due to sloooooow shipping I have to run out to a local box store and pick up a bag because I've run out waiting to receive product from Amazon.....savings down the drain.

review/text: It became obvious immediately that my Havanese had a sensitive stomach.  I had to keep changing dog foods to find one that worked.  For a while, I even combined two together.  After awhile, all failed.  I did extensive research on different foods, and decided to give Pinnacle a try after liking what I read.  It has been a success.  My dog loves the food, and he doesn't have any more stomach issues.  Clean-up is now a breeze.  I have a happy dog and a happy dog's mommy.  :)  Amazon's price is what keeps me coming back.  It's way more reasonable than the pet stores and delivery is always prompt.

review/summary: Excellent Miso
review/text: This is the heartiest of the Eden Miso packets and it does have a very good flavor along with great lasting quality (it took me over a year to use up 3 packs). People tend to make the mistake of thinking that because Miso is soy based it will be salty when mixed with liquid but this is less often the case. You can add soy sauce or Tamari for salt purpose, Miso is just the base. I saw a review that panned this Eden Shiro Miso, Organic Rice & Soybean, 12.1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3) but Miso and Rice are about the most bland combination you can start with and must be seasoned to taste. That's why I start with this Barley mix, it has a more robust flavor to begin with but making Miso is about finding the base flavor that you like beyond the seasoning which comes later (some might prefer a thinner rice base). So in sum this Miso Barley has a strong flavor, holds up well to just about any use including thicker sauces and can provide a lot of base when mixed into soup.

review/summary: Mugi is the heartiest
review/text: I have tried all sorts of different miso varieties.  That, by no means, makes me an expert - I'm only an authority on what I personally like but when it comes to miso, I feel that it should have a hearty, almost beef stock taste and that is what the Mugi miso produces.  It is wonderful served up simple with some broccoli and sprouts in a soup with just a teaspoon of miso, couple of cups of hot water and a dash of toasted sesame oil.  Delicious.  And I can't help but say this; whenever I have felt poorly, miso is my medicine of choice.  It is easy on the stomach, good for your digestion, and very filling.  Edensoy makes a variety of miso flavors, from Shiro, or white miso to Hacho which is almost black and has a bold and unusual flavor, a bit too bold for me.  Mugi is the happy medium of flavor and consistency in an easy to use resealable pouch.  I'm really happy that Amazon is carrying this (Prime shipping and all!) Miso lovers dream of this kind of good deal :)

I tasted nothing of this better grain for a miso blend and the overall taste was pretty bland. I  can't recommend it.

review/summary: Makes me feel good.
review/text: Very tasty. If I am not feeling well, I have some quinoa and then I feel better. It is very gentle on my stomach and soothing. It is so full of vitamins and gluten-free. It is so natural.<br /><br />I eat it in a bowl with milk and sugar, or plain as a side-dish. I also add it to meatloaf instead of the bread crumbs.<br /><br />To rinse it-I line a collander (strainer) with a kitchen towel, measure 1 cup of quinoa into it, let water run over it until the collander is half full, and then swish my hand around the quinoa. I let the water drain out of the collander and then repeat the process two more times. After it has drained for the final time, I let the quinoa fall out of the towel into the pot I am going to cook it in. I brush the quinoa that doesn't come out with my hand. (I do all this in the sink so it doesn't get all over.)<br /><br />Then I add the water (for the recipe) to the pot, add a little butter and salt, let it boil, and then turn the heat down to low for 15 minutes-or until most of the water is gone.<br /><br />YUMMY!!

review/summary: Not the best quinoa option
review/text: I have tried several brands of quinoa and this is my least favorite because of the bitter taste. The other brands (Bob's Red Mill, Nature's Harvest, NOW) are pre-rinsed, which helps remove the bitterness. Have you ever tried rinsing quinoa? The unboiled grains are tiny and slip through all but the tightest knit colander or sieve.  Even after rinsing, there was still a bitter taste. The price is more competitive, but the taste leaves much to be desired.

Big mistake!<br /><br />I am a super picky eater and have no shame about criticizing 'food' that should never be considered food!  If I am putting it in my body, it better be good!  Not to mention the fact that my stomach retaliates every time I feed it something that goes against it's evil plan to control my life and dominate the world.<br /><br />Quinoa is absolutely delicious!  I prefer the taste and texture to rice and no need to mention the fact that quinoa is much more nutritious.  It goes great as a side to any stir fry.  Just by itself it is absolutely delicious.  And my stomach loves it!  It is simple and easy to make.  Just rinse it three times, put it in the rice cooker, add water, olive oil, salt, and a little bit of cumin....and you've got yourself a taste of heaven.<br /><br />Now go out and tell your friends about quinoa.<br /><br />By the way, those two cups I originally made, they were not enough.  I should have made four cups because some people--I won't name names--gobbled it all up.

review/text: I ordered the Arrowhead Mills Quinoa, 14-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6) from Panache.  It arrived quickly, and it cooks up perfectly.  It's high in fiber, low in fat... very nutritious.  I just don't really care for the taste of it.  I mean, it's OK, but I can take it or leave it.  Yeah, I know I gave it five stars, but that was based on the quality of the product itself, not my personal taste.  I know a lot of people really like it.  My wife really likes it.  I was expecting it to be a little more rice-like in texture.<br /><br />My suggestion to anyone who has not tried it is to buy a single bag of it first.  Who knows, you might really like it.  If so, come back for the six pack.

review/summary: Great stuff, goes a long way...
review/text: I love this stuff! It's healthy, hearty and goes the distance. One cup dry is enough for four sides for four adults. High in protein, fiber and carbohydrates. It's excellent for individuals on a a healthy eating plan including vegans and vegetarians. If you can run a boil either on a stove or a camp fire, this is EXCELLENT for backpacking. It's SUPER light weight and is filling. WIll need some salt and pepper for most eaters. I took some on a four day stent and it was excellent! A great way to reenergize. Again, waiting for the boil out (cooks like rice - until the water is completely absorbed) can kill a stove tank rather quickly, so if you have access to a fire and can sustain heat without issue, it's an AWESOME choice. For weight it's tough to beat. Oatmeal is always trusty as well. If you haven't tried quinoa, I recommend picking up a back locally before grabbing 6 14 oz bags here! But, this brand is great and much more cost effective than local purchasing.

For those of you that have learned that quinoa has natural saponins that are detergent like which means that it needs to be washed, this is slightly a pain before cooking.<br /><br />I think for a couple dollars more, I will opt for pre-rinsed stuff next time. But if you don't mind having to rinse, this is great for you.

review/summary: Delicious, nutritious, and so versatile!
review/text: My family and I love this stuff! I have used it to make burgers, nuggets, loaf, casserole, cereal, muffins, and more. Quinoa is so versatile that there are many different ways to use this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. As a vegetarian I'm glad to have an easy and delicious way to get protein, calcium, and iron! I haven't found it to be bitter, as others are saying.

review/summary: Love it, easy and VERY filling
review/text: I've been searching for a while, and this is the best price I've found for quinoa.  Yes, you do have to rinse it, just like you'd have to rinse other grains or dried beans.  I've got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HV9HQ0">fine mesh strainer similar to this one</a>, and it makes the job easy.  I just rinse until the foam is gone--not long at all, MUCH faster than rinsing rice--and I've never tasted any bitterness.<br /><br />Cooking is also easy and quick, especially compared to rice.  I use 2 parts water to 1 part quinoa.  Bring to a boil and turn down to simmer.  Ten minutes later, it's done.  Other reviewers have mentioned additional cooking methods to add more flavor, and I'm looking forward to trying these.  I often use it the same way I use rice.<br /><br />Quinoa is high in protein and it's a complete protein, so it's filling and good for you.  I'll have about a quarter cup with dinner, and find (sadly) that I'm too full to snack at midnight.  Sometimes I have it for breakfast, replacing oatmeal.<br /><br />Love this, wish I'd found it years ago.

review/summary: High Mountain Magic.  Food of the Gods
review/text: Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa).<br /><br />The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.<br /><br />In that maiden purchase I also added Lavender Oil - 4 oz. - EssOil and NOW Foods, Clove Oil - 4 oz to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YV7ZAI">McCormick Cloves, Ground, 16-Ounce Unit</a>, and lavender teaThe Tao Of Tea Herbal Tea Lavender, 100% Organic, 2.0-Ounce Tin (Pack of 3).  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.<br /><br />I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, "nutrition" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of "yummy.").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to "gourmet it" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As "rice" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with "noodle heaven"; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As "oatmeal" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa.<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl (use a large one to avoid the mess of boiling over) then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Depending on power levels and volume of food, a microwave sometimes cooks 4 times faster than "outside-the-waves" cooking.  As an example of time variance with larger amounts of food: 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (�) cup liquid.<br /><br />I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate "lid"; zap it for another minute or half, then let it "steep" in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)<br /><br />In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.<br /><br />But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate "lid" I can just place it on the table for family style "digging in."<br /><br />I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!<br /><br />Recently, Arrowhead Mills, Alter Eco Fair Trade, Berry Farm, Eden, Now Foods, and Angelinas have been added to my list of  purveyors of Quinoa.<br /><br />In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill, and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm also very confident in ordering their Quinoa as well.<br /><br />The reviews on Quinoa Red were helpful. In addition to the most common golden grain, I've only seen black Quinoa, which is also appealing, and is reportedly the oldest variety. Well, actually all the reviews I've read on Quinoa have offered something of value to the info I've already gathered. The extra details of info on the Alter Eco Fair Trade buying pages were appreciated very much. (I used to sell Quinoa in my CITY CHEF kitchen store, which is no longer open; I spend all my time writing now, with a little cooking on the side.)<br /><br />Quinoa has an iteresting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:<br /><br />--  The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment's, like worms or parasites.<br /><br />-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.<br /><br />-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the "naked" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise-old-grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eons-younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.<br /><br />Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).<br /><br />Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of "health"?<br /><br />Here's an interesting question to ponder:<br /><br />Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had "lived" long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?<br /><br />For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O">Virgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz</a><br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books, including:<br />Molasses Moon

review/text: Imagine you took a raspberry, drizzled chocolate syrup on it, and then put it on a frying pan.  You turned on the frying pan and let it sizzle for about 3 or 4 hours.  Put that in a coffee filter and brew it.  Sound good?  I didn't think so.  Thats what this coffee tastes like to me.  I bought a double pack, and I don't like it.  I tried to like it, and even gave it a second shot.  I wish I knew what to do with the rest of it, but I wouldn't subject my friends to this, so I can't give it to them.

The coffee reminded me of cheap Folgers with some international delights creamer thrown in. Typically that grosses me out, it's so artificial tasting and that is what I got with this. Glad it was just one in a variety pack and I didn't have money wasted. I think I'll stick to a good regular brew and add my own vanilla.

review/summary: Not my favorite-  syrup artificial flavor
review/text: I bought a 48 pack of this through Amazon when it was on special.  I normally drink medium blends and stay away from flavored but my wife likes the flavored coffees.  Her favorite is Pumpkin Spice from Green Mountain.<br /><br />What we found is the flavor of this was artificial.  I almost think it tastes a bit like maple syrup.  Too sweet...it would be better with less of the flavor.  I tried making it on the largest cup setting on the B70 but that just waters down the coffee.<br /><br />If you like the flavored liquid coffee creamers, this might be something you will like.

review/summary: Best Flavor - Super Convenient
review/text: Of all the K-Cup flavors we've brewed, this is the best.  It is so good that we have actually subscribed (15% discount!) to receive these boxes every couple months.  The flavor is great and it is extremely convenient in the morning to just pop the K-Cup in our brewer and 15 seconds later we have a hot cup of coffee.

review/summary: Indulgent treat!
review/text: This is a rich and indulgent cup of coffee, yet not overwhelming with strong artificial flavor as so many other are.  I have purchased many flavors and then don't want to finish the box, not so with this one.  It is definitely not my morning coffe, but rather the type you come home and brew after you've smelled and resisted a local Starbucks!  The main flavor is velvety rich coffee, with strong hints of raspberry and chocolate perfectly blended in.  I strongly recommend a "cozy-up" with a cup of this and a good book :)

review/summary: Meh
review/text: Not that good, and it does have a very very strong taste. I think this would be my last resort coffee. It tastes like a cheap dark chocolate raspberry candy.

review/summary: Definite Vanilla Flavor. Smooth, Medium Blend Coffee.
review/text: This Van Houtte french vanilla blend has a definite vanilla flavor to it and is especially enhanced with a touch of sweetener or sugar.<br /><br />It seems to have a slightly more vanilla flavor than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXFKGM">Wolfgang Puck Vanilla Francaise (Flavored), 24-Count K-cups (Pack of 2)</a> and about as much as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HWI700">Emeril's Vanilla Bean Bam!, Medium Roast Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>.<br /><br />This one is solid medium blend coffee that is very smooth & not acidic.  Recommended.

review/summary: A good flavored coffee
review/text: The name sounded great - chocolate raspberry truffle - but would it taste as good as it sounds? Well, I was impressed. This has to be one of my favorite flavored coffees, along with some hazelnut ones, even though I typically prefer unflavored coffees.<br /><br />UPDATE 2011-01-03: I don't like this as much as I use too... it's not bad, but I'm just not "excited" about the flavor as much anymore. Plus I find it leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. I'm not "wanting" it in the morning, instead preferring to desire mostly unflavored coffees - like "Van Houtte Caf&eacute;, Costa Rica Tarrazu (Light Roast)", which is really good... so I'm reducing my rating to 4 out of 5 stars.
