review/text: I am a big tea drinker.I have tried many kinds but my all time favorite is Bigelow's Constant Comment Tea.<br />Since I like it so much I was delighted to find that it was cheaper if I ordered it from Amazon.com. Of course you are having to buy more tea but it keeps well so there is no problem!

review/summary: Constant Complement +++
review/text: This type of tea has gathered constant complements from early times in America and especially in the variant created by Ruth Bigelow in 1945. It is a fine rich black tea with a spice-mix based on orange zest, cinnamon and cloves. Even in its bag form, it seems like a tea follower's favorite personal blend. It is a rare tea that one can drink hot, icy or even lukewarm -- anytime with anything. Like some have remarked, as with most black teas, it is actually good brewed to a standard ratio of one bag per tea cup [five for a quart] -- and can be added to most other black teas -- so one can extend a supply of "Constant Comment" upon want or need. It is great hot with milk or cream and sugar or honey. When making iced-tea, it is well to add some lemon or lime and sugar or honey to taste, before adding ice -- as this tea seems just a bit sweet due to its spice-mix. It is good with a bit of rum too. "Constant Comment" can hold its own, alone, as well. "Constant Comment" looks good, smells good and tastes good +++

review/summary: Not as good as I hoped it would be.
review/text: I just recently tried Stash's "Orange Spice" tea on a trip to Hawaii. I have known of orange spice tea for a long time but it never interested me before. There were some various tea bags available in the lobby of our hotel, so I thought, what the hell, I'll just toss it out if I dont like it. I actually did like it very much to my surprise.<br /><br />Now that im back in the mainland, I wanted to buy some more "orange spice" tea, so I picked up Bigelow Constant Comment. I was dissapointed with the flavor, it is weaker than Stash's, less orange flavor and less spice flavor as well.<br /><br />Now, far as I know, I think Bigelow invented orange spice tea, or were at least the first ones to sell it. But I think they could add more orange and spice to the tea, as well as some more tea in the bag too. Both Stash and Bigelow seem like they are stingy on the amount of tea in their bags, makes for a somewhat weak brew.<br /><br />Anyone try Celestial Seasonings orange spice? more or less flavor than Bigelow?

review/summary: Wonderful aroma, great taste
review/text: I'll admit it. I'm a tea snob. Most of the tea sold in American supermarkets is just... junk. Floor sweepings, as my Indian friends would say. I buy almost all of my tea directly from China, and it's always loose leaves, not tea bags. But Constant Comment has a special place in my heart, and I go on binges where it is pretty much all I drink. The aroma is lovely, and the combination of orange rind and cardamom makes for an interesting and flavorful cup of tea. CC is probably floor sweepings, too. But it tastes great and is very comforting. I do love these large boxes of 40 tea bags (4 bags per foil pouch) that Amazon sells, as it is convenient and long-lasting. One note: it does seem to give me a bigger caffeine "jolt" than I would like, so I usually de-caf it by brewing it for one minute, pouring out the water and then brewing for 3 minutes in fresh water. Your mileage may vary regarding the caffeine.

review/summary: Vet recommended, Cat approved!
review/text: I adopted two very undernurished kittens from the Humane Society, whose on-staff vet said that AvoDerm dry and canned food is the best on the market for cats. When I took the kittens for their vet checkup 6 months later, my own vet also agreed that this is the best food available and was so pleased with the health of the kittens. My older cats have also seen a huge improvement in their coats -- much more silky and shiny, shedding is reduced and their weight is easily maintained on this food. I recommend trying this food if you have finicky cats or they have health problems.<br /><br />My cats absolutely LOVE all the Avoderm Select Cuts (chunky-style) flavors AND all the flavors of this pate-style food. The seafood flavors seem to be the most popular among the cats, but many vets recommend avoiding too much seafood for male cats due to the urine crystals it can cause. I started feeding the beef and chicken exclusively and they eat every last drop.<br /><br />Bottom line: It costs more than your average food, but it's worth every penny (buying it by the case can give you a pretty good discount from most vendors). If you consider that it keeps them healthier, which can save you from expensive vet bills in the long run, then it's worth it. Plus, think of the time you'll save not having to clean up after their shedding! Also, I've noticed that this brand does not result in the runny, smelly poo that some other, cheaper brands do. Try this food out on your cats -- you'll be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: even the pickiest eaters love AvoDerm
review/text: We have three cats, and they all have VERY different tastes when it comes to food. One of them, my eldest (she's 15), will go through periods where she just turns up her nose at all foods, so it's a bit of a problem to find a food that all three cats will eat, isn't totally bad for them, and doesn't leave a lot of waste as well.<br /><br />AvoDerm is the favorite around here- even my 15 year old prefers it. It's the one food we can count on her to eat. And it's a good quality food- I'm not a feline dermatologist but we've been feeding it to our cats since it hit the market, and they all have lovely, fluffy, shiny coats and we have definitely noticed a big decrease in hairballs (one of our cats has the coat of a Maine Coon, so he's got a LOT of fur and spends a lot of time grooming).<br /><br />Also, the food can stand to sit out for a bit- with multiple cats, not all three of them are asking to eat at the same time, so finding a food that could sit in the bowl for longer than ten minutes without turning into a biscuit is a challenge. Whenever the 15 year old asks for food we tend to give it to her to try and inspire her to eat, so if the bowl she eats from sits out for a little bit and one of the other cats wanders into the kitchen a while after, the food is still fresh and not dark brown and crusty.<br /><br />So the cats like it, they eat a lot of it (even the refrigerated leftovers), it stays "fresh" in the bowl, and it seems to benefit their coats and health. I'm a fan and will continue to buy this food for my cats as they as they continue to benefit from it.

review/text: I found these cookies to be very dense and difficult to bite through. There are nowhere near enough chocolate chips -- many of the cookies in my bag didn't have a single chip in them.<br /><br />Regarding the "organic" advertising: the ingredient list does not say that the chocolate chips used are organic and they contain soy lecithin. Since products that are not advertised as "100% Organic" and do not carry the "USDA Organic" seal may contain up to 30% non-organic ingredients it is very likely that these cookies contain lecithin from GMO soy because the label does not specify that the soy source used is organic or non-GMO.

review/summary: Great for when you want to make a single glass of Kool-Aid
review/text: I keep these on hand for car trips with the grandkids. You can turn a boring bottle of water into a flavorful Kool-Aid drink by just adding a single packet to it. Just open the bottle, pour in the contents of one packet, then close and shake. Each packet contains both the Kool-Aid mix and the amount of sugar that's needed for a single drink. Perfect size for a typical water bottle. We use reusable watter bottles with them, so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the Kool-Aid.<br /><br />They taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of Kool-Aid, just in a single serving size. These single servings work really well for us since we never drink a whole pitcher when me make one, and end up pouring half of it out. These were such a great idea!

review/text: I'm happy with this popcorn.  It has a burn to it, but it's not too bad.  The spices hit the back of the mouth and it seems to be a delayed reaction giving you time to really enjoy the flavor first.  When it pops it has a smell almost like cardamom or cinnamon, possibly a slight nutmeg smell - but the taste is smoky and buttery with maybe a hint of sweet, but not much, before the burn begins.<br /><br />One thing to note on the nutritional information they offer on Amazon --  One bag has about 3 servings..  so it's 160 calories and 8 grams of fat per serving - or 480 calories and 24 grams of fat per bag.<br /><br />It seemed to pop well and the corn itself seems to be of good quality and flavor.  The popping instructions say that it takes between 1 and 4 minutes to pop (it took 2 and � minutes in my microwave).  It also suggests that you heat a cup of water for one minute before cooking the popcorn and suggests putting the bag on top of something else to raise it off the bottom of the oven prior to popping if you are finding you are having popping issues.  I didn't take either suggestion and the bag popped up well with a minimal number of kernels left over.  You will want to make sure to shake the bag really well before opening to help distribute the spices.<br /><br />Over all it's good popcorn with a nice after-burn.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not as good as other popcorn I've had (Orville Redenbacher's Salt and Lime and Salt and Pepper) but I would order it again.

review/summary: Wonderful Product! Only one on the market I'd use for my little one!
review/text: After doing lots of research on the different rice cereals out there, this is one of the few on the market I would give to my little one. Some of the brands, even organic, contain soy or wheat. Both of which I personally don't believe are good for infants, especially when they are first getting use to solids. We have been using this since he was 6 months old (now almost a year). It worked great with breastmilk in the begining and now we alternate between that and purified water, which also works well. I have found if you mix a fruit or veggie pur&eacute;e with it before adding water or milk, it mixes a little bit better without so much clumping. I would highly recommend this product to anyone, along with the entire line of plum organics!

I love that it's certified organic and that it also contains pre/probiotics for easier digestion. I mix my daughter's rice with breastmilk and I find it to be fluffy, not gummy or slimy like the other commercial brands. I also like that it tastes good too (I also taste whatever I feed my daughter first). She loves this cereal and she's never had an allergic reaction or digestive problems afterwards. I also want to note that I haven't had an issue with weird smells or having a rancid container like others stated. While I wished the price was a bit more affordable, I have no regrets about feeding my child this infant cereal! I highly recommend parents who are looking for healthy and organic rice cereal to purchase this brand. Your child will be quite happy and it's a great choice to introduce healthy solid foods too!

I like to tie my bag and then carry it by the handle until I get to a trash receptacle.  With these, you only have a knot at the top.  Otherwise, they are perfect!

review/summary: Good product, but sort of expensive
review/text: Our family used these bags for a while... it's great to find a non-gmo cornstarch bag that is REALLY biodegradeable, unlike some of the poop bags, which say they are, but really they just break down into a billion tiny scraps of plastic (so they theorize they "degrade" faster than regular plastic. However, this just means more tiny micro-bits of plastic in the landfills and ocean!). Beware what you read in the product descriptions! It should be 100% "compostable".<br /><br />However, seems these bags just keep getting more expensive. Good product, but I want to pay as little as possible to throw out poop! I recently discovered another similar product at about half the cost, which are called Nature Babycare Eco Diaper Disposal bags: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EWDPPU/ref=rcxsubs_mys2_product_title<br /><br />Obviously, these are intended for disposable diapers, but work just as well for poop. They are a little thin (a little thinner than the Bio Bags), but they work just fine and I haven't had any problems with them. They are about the same size as the Bio Bags with tie handles. They are white, not black like the Bio Bags, but don't show through, so they are a winner for us. I'm really not too picky about what to throw out poop in as long as it works, it biodegrades, and I don't end up with poop on my hands. I'm happy to find another product that costs less, hope this helps someone else.

review/summary: They work but...
review/text: While I feel better throwing these away because I know in time the bag and it's refuse will biodegrade in a good manner the bags themselves are on the weak side. You get more than enough in this package but after tearing one off the roll they have a tendency to rip along the seams when I try opening them. There are nights where I have gone through 3 or 4 bags and other times I can go weeks at a time without wasting one. While I appreciate the concept I will be searching for another brand that can withstand my Hulk like strength.

review/summary: Eco-option for dog bags
review/text: We love these bags and use them daily for our 2 large-breed dogs. They are roomy enough to hold both of their waste on the same walk. The bags have pre-cut holes in the top so you can slide one of the bag through a hole and it seals without messing with tying it, which is super helpful with 2 dogs pulling you along for a walk. Can also clip the bag via the hole onto their harness for long walks where there isn't a trash can so you don't have to carry/smell the waste. Best part is it's biodegradable and compostable.

review/summary: keep rollin'
review/text: I love these bags.  I try to be as green as I can and these bags help me get one step "closer."  I actually use these bags to scoop the cat litter frome the multiple cat boxes around the house.  They are the perfect size and I love the fact that they come in a roll that allows you to just tear off one at a time.  Some stores do not carry the "rolls" anymore so it was great to find them here at Amazon.  They are also great (perfect size) for picking up dog waste (their original intention I guess).  I have several friends with dogs and I always keep a roll in my car - very convenient to store neatly in the glove box or console.

review/text: These BioBag Dog Waste Bags are easy to use. They are big enough for my husband's hand to fit in to. I use them with my Li'l Pals Waste Bag Dispenser.<br /><br />You do have to take your time tearing the bags apart. They are thin and if you tear too fast you can tear a hole in the bottom of the bag and the consequences are not pretty. I take my time tearing the bags and have not had any problems with them. I have been walking in 100 degree weather using them. Once they are tied I do not have any odor coming from them as I walk.

Also, the roll is pretty thick so you might have trouble fitting it in your bag dispenser (I just tear several of the bags from the roll so it's skinny enough to fit in my dispenser - not a problem for me).

review/text: My singular complaint is that these bags don't fit in the dog bag dispenser I already own; The bags are not wound around a center core and they are loosely wound so they can't even be made to fit in my holder. (I even tried to remove half of the bags and kind of shoving them into the holder).<br /><br />Other than that, the size and quality of the bags is great. I have 2 small dogs (chihuahuas) and 1 bag works for picking up after both of them.<br /><br />I read the previous reviews and it's important to me that these bags comply to the strictest composting standards.

review/summary: Great bags on a roll, but treat them gently
review/text: I love that these bags are on a roll and the Amazon price is great. A minor complaint is that an entire 20-bag roll doesn't fit into most standard-sized poop bag dispensers. However, it's not that much work to count and tear off a section of 10 bags and roll those up (start with the sealed end and work towards the open end).<br /><br />The one-star deduction is because these bags easily rip and puncture. Be careful when you are tearing each bag off as you can easily rip the bottom of the next bag on the roll. And don't even try to use that hole at the top of the bag; I'm not even sure what that hole is for. If you try to follow the diagram for closing the bag, the hole will tear open. Hopefully it will tear towards the top and not towards the bottom. Just tie a knot at the top and ignore that diagram. Also, if you drop a full bag on the sidewalk, it's very possible to put tiny holes in the bag when it hits the sand in the sidewalk cement. Hopefully a garbage can is nearby, because the bag is no longer odor-proof.

The opening in the box for pulling the roll works well and they're easy to just throw in your pocket.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was ease of use of the bag. They're a tiny bit tough to open (but that's because the material sort of sticks to itself) and they could maybe tie a little easier. Let's just say I'm glad I have a small dog! Otherwise, they're great!

They are not flimsy or thin - your hand feels very protected against doggie's busines. I did prefer the flat boxes vs the roll but this way has less packaging. The bags are nice a roomy and easy to tie. The directions on the actual bags are little confusing so we just tie it the way we like. The price is worth the peace of mind for me knowing that all these bags will eventually break down. Will continue to purchase!

The bags are a great size for changing the boxes; we only use one bag to empty both out. The boxes are changed at least twice a day. They are not too big and not too small. It can be a little awkward at times scooping into the bag, but you get the hang of it after a few times. I also use the thirteen gallon bags for my shredder.

One improvement, is make the bags a little longer, to fit diapers a bit better.  My daughter is wearing size 5 diapers, and if she goes up a size, I fear they won't fit well enough to allow me to tie a knot.  This goes for both Seventh Generation diapers and also the gDiaper compostable inserts.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I LOVE this soda.  It is made from real cola nuts and sugar and you can taste the difference.  To be fair, I don't drink much soda and feel fairly guilty when I do.  Soda is just one of the top ten worst things you can consume on a regular basis, let's be honest.  So when I do get an occasional craving for it, I try to at least moderate the badness of the choice.  I started drinking this soda whenever I'd stop into a local pizza place, until I started craving the soda more than the pizza.  At almost $2 a can elsewhere, I decided to spring for a case on Amazon.<br /><br />Is this Coke or Pepsi?  NO!  If you love those brands, you may not like this and as it is the more expensive of the choices, you're probably better off sticking with those chemical and corn syrup-laden options.  However, if you are like me and eat mostly natural, organic and healthy fare (or want to), this is a delicious occasional indulgence.  It is unusual in taste... it is almost more carbonation than flavor, if that makes any sense, but it is very appealing to me.  While I hope the 24 cans I ordered last a long while, I will probably order more when they run out.

review/summary: Not for people who like HFCS and 'fake' cola
review/text: I don't know what some of the negative reviewers are used to drinking, I'm guessing major name brands with HFCS as the main ingredient.<br />We bought this at a local organic store, and loved it. We also love the Root Bear Encore by Blue Sky. It tastes like real cola did, back in the days before P and CC adulterated it with chemicals and flavor enhancers. It does not have a heavy after taste, nor does it taste like cough syrup. Maybe they reformulated the recipe since the negative reviews were posted. But I also think that if someone is used to commercial soda by major manufacturers, which tastes nothing like REAL cola, root bear, cream soda or ginger ale, then they will not like this.<br />If you aren't sure about it, don't buy the 24 pack. Find it locally, try it, then buy it in bulk. And if you are not used to a chemical free, mainly organic, diet, stay away. Your tastebuds are skewed to crave things like HFCS and this definitely will affect your palate.

review/text: I have been on a kick trying to find the best natural/organic soda and I was excited to try this one. I found a 6 pack at a local health food store and rushed it home to the fridge with care. When we tried it the next day, after a few swigs my wife and I both noticed a weird "fruity" aftertaste... It almost tasted like prunes or sour grapes. I really enjoy a complex-tasting cola with different oils and spices, but this wasn't it. We didn't even come close to finishing the can and there are 5 of these left in our fridge. It's not horrible or simply undrinkable, but for me it's simply not good enough to waste the calories.

Our favorite of course is Flatt, which is very spicy and loaded with caffeine and vitamin C. There are those times when nothing but a cola will do, when it's just so thirst quenching. This cola fills the bill.

review/text: I love this Organic Cola. I must say, I was very hesitant when buying this, as I love the Switch Sparking Soda and have some Mexican Coke. I was very satisfied by the cola taste Blue Sky Cola gave. As usual after the first can, I was a little bit disappointed but like most things, it takes about THREE tries for you to either appreciate it or not like it. By the third, I was hooked by the taste and sweetness was perfect. I place it ahead of the Mexi Coke and plus Blue Sky lets us know on the can it is ORGANIC and one of the ingredients is a "cola Nut;" How can I go wrong?<br /><br /> Definitely give it a try, and drink a few cans before reviewing the best tasting cola in my very humble opinion.

review/summary: Awesome cola in the healthiest form it can come in.
review/text: I buy this soda because it is organic. Every ingredient is as safe as it can be. Organic sugar as the sweetener. Caramel coloring and tartaric acid, as opposed to phosphoric acid, that are derived naturally from the sugar and acid in grapes. Of course the cola flavoring is also organic. These days nearly every drink available at any given gas station is so loaded with toxins/carcinogens it's really actually not funny. So it's nice to have a truly delicious alternative that quite EASILY stands up to the flavor of Poopsi or Coo-Cooo Cola. I am ashamed I grew up drinking Coo-Coo cola, no really. They know darn well what they put into their drinks and they know it's not natural. If there is any shadow of a doubt about a chemical, why in the world would you still use it citing lack of evidence as reason for your continued use of artificial caramel coloring? If someone wants to smoke pot or ingest these ridiculous designer smokes, example K2, the government then tells you that you can not ingest/sell/buy that citing lack of suppporting evidence as the reason for your denial of anyone's human rights. All this is why I'm willing to spend a few extra dollars on a delicious cola that is made with non-toxic ingredients. Thank you Blue Sky and thank you Amazon for selling this tasty drink. It's a much better deal than buying it at the health food store.

review/summary: Organic cola!
review/text: I have been a Coke drinker for all of my life, and I still drink it sometimes.  But if given the opportunity, I would choose an organic sugar soda over HFCS any day.  It is an added bonus that this cola is caffeine free.  I get enough caffeine from my coffee.  I eat organic whenever possible, but I grew up on junk food and still get cravings.  I thank the stars for organic junk food!!!

review/summary: wonderful old fashioned cola taste
review/text: Coke and Pepsi used to be made with cane sugar, like this stuff. And as soon as I tasted it, it reminded me of what cola tasted like back then. A pizza shop gives me a free coca-cola with my lunch, and when I took it home and tasted it, it had no cola taste, and that fructose overload. Popped open a can of this blue-sky organic cola, and the difference was major. Sweet, but delicious sweet.

review/summary: Great Substitute!
review/text: LOVE LOVE LOVE the Blue Sky Colas. We've started eating better and have given up cokes and similar drinks. Every once in a while, however, we crave a sweet, fizzy drink. We've found these are excellent substitutes. They certainly have a different taste, but over the past few months we have grown to prefer these over a real coke. The cane sugar/syrup doesn't give you that 'yuck' feeling in your stomach after drinking, either. Can't say enough good about them.

review/text: I purchased this soda because of concerns about the caramel coloring being used in colas.  I thought I would try the organic blue sky cola, and while I think it tastes fine, I noticed that the "caramel color" in the ingredient list does not indicate where it comes from or how it is processed.<br /><br />See Link below:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />FDA Urged to Prohibit Carcinogenic "Caramel Coloring"<br /><br />I've emailed the company a few days ago, but to date, no reply.

review/summary: It's not cheap, but it's the best "pure cane sugar" cola available nationally
review/text: With all due respect to Pepsi for at least trying, "Throwback" isn't for all cola drinkers fleeing high fructose corn syrup; it's for regular Pepsi drinkers.  After trying at least four twelve packs, I simply cannot get past the Pepsi flavoring (which I have never liked).  I recently spent some time in Texas, and H-E-B (which all but dominates the Texas grocery market) came out with its own "pure cane sugar" cola, which costs half of "Throwback" and just over a third the cost of Blue Sky, and it is great stuff.  Unfortunately, they don't do mail order.  So, until I can get my hands on more, Blue Sky is the best available unless you like paying more for the microbrewery equivalent to "pure cane sugar" cola, organic or non-organic.<br /><br />Oh, and curiously, Amazon is selling the organic version of Blue Sky cola for the same price as the non-organic six-packs you might find in your local grocer's Natural Foods section.

review/summary: Former Coke Cola addict
review/text: I have been addicted to Coke-a-Cola since I was in High school (2000-2004). Eventually I got to the point where I preferred drinking then eating. I gained a lot of weight and went through horrible caffeine withdrawals (if I went more then 12 hours without my coke -a- Cola caffeine fix). I tried to quit soda with caffeine/hfcs many times but eventually always giving in because Coke always helps with my migraines. This soda became not only a substitute but by favorite,  It has a  lot of sugar and that is why I only gave it a 4/5.  I prefer this one verse the other COla.  This one is less expensive and organic compared to the Blue Sky Cola (vs this one which is Organic Blue Sky New Century Cola).  I usually water it down with over a cup of ice to dilute the sugar.<br /><br /> Score: 4/5 It is literally the best Soda out there with or without HFCs.  It didn't get 5/5 because of how much sugar in each can. I  end up having to dilute it with lots of ice.<br /><br />I  had always been super picky of how my Cola was. It needed to COke Cola it needed to be fresh, crisp, and super cold.  I am one of those people that can tell the different between coke and cola... I now perfer this one.  FHC's are horrible for your body  and I do see great improvement and alleviation from some of my lupus symptoms since I stopped taking in HFCs (through Coke-a-Cola)  .

review/summary: Awful, Just Awful
review/text: OK, allow me to make the following disclaimer prior to the review:<br /><br />I have drank a LOT of soda in my life...Coke, Pepsi, RC, store brands, Lemon-Limes, Oranges, Grapes, Cherry, Root Beers,etc., in both Regular and Diet versions of all the above. I generally do not purchase "organic" products b/c of the associated costs, so it might be that if you are likely to purchase this product, you might deem my tastebuds dead anyway. Having said that:<br /><br />A vegan co-worker had a six pack of this product in the office fridge of which five cans have remained for about a week and half. I asked him about 30 minutes ago if he minded if I tried one of his sodas, he said sure, that he didn't care for it, but he could see how others would. Me being a die-hard carnivore, I mistakenly thought his dislike of the product to be a good sign. Wrong!<br /><br />This is not good. It starts off fizzy, then you get the cola taste, then you get some sort of bizarre tannic sort of aftertaste. I couldn't figure out what it was, then saw on the label that one of the ingredients is tartaric acid (from grapes). Ugh. After several more sips, I concluded that the aftertaste is the same as that of very tart, almost sour grapes.<br /><br />I still have half the can left. Slow sipping doesn't help, neither does a quick gulp. I thought Moxie was the most "different" soda I had ever tasted, but I think this has it beat. To each his own, I suppose, but buyer, you have been warned.

review/text: This kcup was pretty tasty once you get past the weird smell while brewing.  It was described as a bit "funky" by some coworkers.  I tried it out anyway and was impressed.  It's very smooth and has a nice pumpkin flavor.  It gets better as it cools.  The clove flavor is only slighty noticeable which is a very good thing.  The flavor was pretty close to pumpkin pie.  This would mix really well with a good french vanilla kcup and some cinnamon.  The flavor is light years better than the Green Mountain pumpkin spice kcup. It took me a year to get through that box.  I threw out the last few.

review/summary: I looooove this popcorn but can't find it anywhere to buy!
review/text: Unfortunately none of the stores local to me sell this patricular type of Smart Balance Popcorn.  I love this movie theater Smart Balance because it needs no extra butter or salt added to it.  I just wish I could find it in-store or online to buy.  The only time I've been able to buy it was in 2009 when I was out-of-state.

review/summary: Best popcorn I've ever had
review/text: I bought a box of Smart Balance popcorn at Big Lots a few years ago and I think it's pretty fair to say I've been obsessing over it ever since. I haven't been able to find it, and I'm still strolling past the popcorn section in hope that Safeway will sell the one in the red box next to the green Smart Balance popcorn.

review/summary: Just enough xylitol to charge extra...
review/text: There are a lot of reported benefits to xylitol, but Trident is just using it as a marketing gimmick here. The ingredients list for this gum starts out like this: sorbitol, maltitol, gum base, mannitol, xylitol... That's right, xylitol is the fifth ingredient, and the fourth sugar alcohol!<br /><br />If you do a little searching on the internet, you'll come across a number of doctors and dentists who have said that this gum has too little xylitol to have any practical effect. For people who don't read labels closely, this might also lead them to think that this gum is actually sweetened with xylitol (which causes fewer digestive problems than sorbitol and maltitol).<br /><br />The bottom line is that they've added a few milligrams of xylitol so that they can pretend that this gum is healthier and thus charge more.

review/summary: love this gum
review/text: I've chewed it for years...and cannot always find it at Sams Club here in Tulsa.<br />(as a dental hygienist, I come across more and more research about how chewing sugarless gum--especially ones with xylitol in them as a sweetener--help reduce the incidence of dental caries)...and I've been a sugarless gum chewer for years, espcially with Trident Bubble....

review/summary: Trident is the best!
review/text: IMO Trident is the best gum. For me the bubblegum flavor is the best (not to sweet) and last the longest. I decided to buy it off amazon cause none of the stores in my area sell this flavor in bulk. I can find other flavors in packs of three at these stores but not the bubblegum flavor. Plus, it is cheaper to buy it in bulk than single packs or packs of three. I will definitely be getting more once my supply runs out!!
