review/summary: Great Chip!
review/text: With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: "Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand� Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag"<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: "At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand�  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are "trans fat free" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging."  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period.

review/summary: Awesome and delicious!
review/text: These are among the best chips I have ever eaten!  I first came upon them when I visited a CostPlus World Market store in Opelika, AL, in the Tiger Town Mall, in 2007.  I wasn't a big fan of dijon-flavored anything, but I decided to give these chips a try.  I was hooked.  I probably ended up buying over a dozen bags within just a few months' time.  I searched all over my part of Alabama (the northwestern part of the state) and could not find them.  I later tried to find them at the World Market in Hoover, at the Patton Creek Shopping Center, and they did not carry this flavor.  However, when I learned that they were available on Amazon.com, and also available for PRIME Shipping - I bought them as soon as I read "Kettle Chips Honey Dijon, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)!"<br /><br />You get a pretty big box, filled with 12 bags of these delicious morsels.  They last quite a while, but I will re-order, very, very soon!  I suggest you buy them, in this bulk form, and enjoy them - you won't be disappointed!  They go great with hamburgers and hot dogs - so they're perfect for spring and this coming summer's outdoor activities and cook-outs!<br /><br />Take my word for it, these chips are a hidden gem lost in the world of snack foods!  Buy some today, and fall in love like me!

review/text: I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these. I think they are really good.  The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ !  They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know.  They are much more flavorful.  Never had a honey-dijon potato chip before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!

review/summary: Spicy Thai
review/text: When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet.

Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you.

review/summary: My favorite Kettle Chip
review/text: These are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag.

review/summary: Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . .
review/text: My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.<br /><br />Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.<br /><br />Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . .

review/text: After looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box, I had to write a review.  I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly.  There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00.  The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag.  I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all.  As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok.  Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon.  Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping.  I'll buy these again...soon.

review/summary: Kettle Chips, Sea Salt
review/text: There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The "best by" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October.

review/summary: the defacto standard for Salt and Vinegar chips
review/text: I've always liked Salt and Vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag. Not with these, the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until you've finished the bag. These are very addictive. If you like salt and vinegar, these are the ultimate chips. Nothing else compares.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're "kettle chips" and they're "fried" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!

review/summary: Lightly salted, yet tasty
review/text: This bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool, such as scissors, don't even try without scissors.<br /><br />They are crispy and taste like chips that aren't advertised as being salted. They definitely aren't healthy, because I can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them, and I can see the grease at the bottom of the bag, too.<br /><br />They are high-quality chips, and deserve to be put on your table.

review/summary: Great strong flavor
review/text: I agree with the company motto "A Natural Obsession".  I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent.  The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread.  Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food.

Unfortunately, it may do the opposite to your backside, so don't do what my mom did and eat an entire bag on an empty stomach or you may spend the afternoon in the bathroom.<br /><br />I still give it a 5 of 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, the online price at Amazon is better than anywhere else I've seen them. Combined with Amazon Prime you'll be getting a great deal on these chips.

They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.<br /><br />Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here.  I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping.  I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price.  The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Kettle Foods Spicy Thai Chips
review/text: The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed "ginger with attitude" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  "Great Taste Naturally" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!

review/text: and THAT is  the problem. I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!<br />I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring.

review/summary: 4 Stars for price and taste
review/text: I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars.

review/text: We've long enjoyed this brand of chip, so when we began to think seriously about limiting out salt intake we were particularly pleased to find these.<br /><br />  Granted I bought them somewhat reluctantly because I'm a confirmed salt-aholic, generously sprinkling it on everything from eggs to green beans.  I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.<br /><br />  How nice to be able to munch on these without worrying about too much salt.

review/text: The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!

review/summary: Things you need to know
review/text: Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes "too much". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are "Krinkle Cut" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.

review/summary: I made a mistake.....
review/text: This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  � homiedog �

review/summary: Do they have to "bite back"?
review/text: I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.

review/text: I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.

review/summary: Best Value EVO Coconut Oil Available
review/text: After searching long and hard for the best value extra virgin organic coconut oil on Amazon, I found this product. Unfortunately since I made the purchase, the price has gone up from about $18 to about $20, but it is still the cheapest EVO coconut oil on Amazon. This is the only EVO coconut oil I have bought, but in my opinion from research I have done, all such products are the same or virtually the same in terms of quality, based on how they are produced.<br /><br />Again, I do not know how other EVO coconut oil products taste, but this product tastes (and smells) great to me, just like fresh coconut, so why would I pay a lot more for another product? As far as I can tell it is identical in every way to the more expensive EVO coconut oil products on Amazon, so I am guessing that few people have bought it and thus no one until now has reviewed it because they assume the lower price means it is lower quality, and I can attest that this is not true. You do have to buy 3 of the 54 oz containers to qualify for the free shipping deal, but if you use this product as much as I do every day, that shouldn't be a disadvantage at all.<br /><br />Lastly, the product actually arrived a day before the expected arrival date, which has only happened for me once before in all my time shopping online, so Vitacost is definitely a reputable seller.<br /><br />Who says you can't sell a high quality product for an affordable price? This is definitely an exception to that rule.

review/text: This Vitacost coconut oil tastes and works just as good as the Nutiva brand and costs a lot less. My local store sells the 54oz Nutiva for about $36. To save some money I thought I'd buy the 54oz Nutiva 2 pack here on Amazon. Then I stumbled across this Vitacost brand and thought I'd give it a try. Since it tastes the same and has the same properties (organic extra virgin), why spend more money on other brands.<br /><br />Updated 7/30/2012 >> WOW! My local Costco now has the 78 ounce Nutiva coconut oil for $21.49. Which works out to just under $0.28 cents per ounce.

I also eat a teaspoon of this everyday and it taste so yummy. If you are looking for coconut oil that tastes great and works wonders for your hair all at a good price, then this is the one for you. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I just received my second order of Vitacost coconut oil. I love this stuff. I now use it for stir frying veggies, frying up burgers, i even fried chicken with this oil and it came out great. This brand by far beats all the other brands on the market in value and taste. And if you suffer from dry skin especially during the cold winter months, just whip this with some shea butter and apply to your skin. Your skin will thank you for it

review/text: Something odd happened after 2- 3 months. I started to notice small changes that happen/not happen. First my blood flow in my legs had improved and the numbness in my toes went away. Next the small fat pocket around my waist got smaller. My joints feel better. I still use olive but less and less and never for cooking any more. I now use it on my toast in the morning. Loving it! Not going back to butter! Most of all... this one is the best value.

review/summary: not 1st pick but works
review/text: I prefer Jarrow with Nutiva as a close enough 2nd. The flavor & aroma of this is not as robust as those but is an acceptable substitute. Perhaps it's the see-through plastic jars that assist in the depletion of the product. Even if the container is uv treated, it's never going to be able to retain the quality as if it were packaged in opaque or dark plastic in my opinion.<br /><br />That said, it smells and tastes like coconut; I'm a repeat buyer and will most likely continue to use this as my #1 choice as long as it remains at this lower price point. Currently I'm getting it for $16.07 for the 54oz, that's like paying $4.77 for a 16oz jar - unheard of & greatly appreciated!!!  My family of 2 goes through these quickly (1 or more every 2 weeks) because it is the primary cooking oil in my home, we use it as a nutritional supplement (4 TBS per day) and use it topically (cosmetically, diaper changes, hair product, bathing and more).<br /><br />UPDATE 3/12/12 - I have never received Nutiva in a clear container but another reviewer claims to have. If this is the case for you as well, perhaps you will notice no difference in the product, only the price, which does tend to fluctuate often.

review/summary: Outdated
review/text: I love coconut oil.  It should last about two years unrefridgerated and this product came to me out dated by one month and the seperate product that I took out to use, went rancid and smelled terribly. I have never had coconut oil go rancid on me.  I kept the jar in the fridge and still used it for cooking and on my skin. The product turned black when heated and this is not a good sign.  I think Vitacost is a great company and they made a mistake and I would buy from them again, but I will send back outdated product from now on.<br />Deb

review/summary: milder smell than others
review/text: First off, I have to say this is the BEST value I have found on EVCO - I really didn't know how BIG this container would be until it arrived!  But the way we go through it, I might divide it into smaller containers and start keeping them in different places instead of always running to the kitchen.  The oil looks and smells fresh and creamy, but maybe I am just getting more used to coconut oil, or maybe this batch doesn't have as much of that cocoa smell?  Not that that is a bad thing, I would just say it seems more neutral, especially after cooking with it.  I have to say that since I've been using this product, I have really lost my cravings and appetite is much less - I am a stay at home mom and think about food/weight all day!!!  Adding the oil to my everyday cooking has made it easier for me to start cutting out more carbs, and have the energy to get back into doing exercise videos a couple times a week...in about 6 weeks I have lost almost 10 pounds, and it has all come off my waist and belly.  TOO EXCITED is an understatement.  Good fats make all the difference, avoid those hydrogenated ones and you'll be amazed.  I feel more relaxed and confident now that the weight really will come off (permanently) in time, without all the fuss of counting calories, fat, blah blah.  Love it!!!

review/text: I switched from another, much more expensive, brand and now prefer this one.  This Vitacost coconut oil is not as clumpy as the brand I was using; and therefore easier to work with and mix with my flax and cottage cheese each day.  The flavor is good and I like the statements on the container:  organic, cold pressed (to leave in all the good healthy stuff), lab tested for heavy metals, etc.  Overall, an excellent value.

review/summary: Yummy! Cures my chocolate craving on Atkins.
review/text: After searching for a cheaper coconut oil than in the stores, I found this one. It tastes even better than the more expensive store bought brand I bought. I use it for so much stuff... Coconut chicken, eggs, in my hair for deep conditioning, in my coffee (it's sooo good!), and I even make "chocolate" with it since I'm on Atkins. I use 6 tablespoons of the oil, 1  tablespoon cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon Splenda, and 1 tablespoon of natural peanutbutter... Put it on parchment paper in the freezer and enjoy :)  It's a nice treat. You can also use it to make "hard shell" for ice cream since the coconut oil hardens or softens from temperature.<br /><br />I'm sure if you try this you won't be disappointed. It has a great flavor, and the price is unbeatable!

review/summary: Great product! Great price!
review/text: I don't usually write reviews but I feel I have to share this. First of all, I want to say that this is probably the best deal I've found yet for coconut oil. It smells and tastes wonderful and it arrived quickly! Next...I actually bought this to give to my mother, who is in the late stages of Alzheimer's. Recently, I've read quite a few articles that praise coconut oil for helping people with this affliction and decided to give it a try. My mom, who is now on hospice, spends most of her days sleeping. When she is awake, she's in a 'zombie-like' stage. She rarely speaks and doesn't recognize any of her family. She won't eat anymore...only drinks Ensure. Anyway, I brought this to her caregivers and asked them to start mixing it into her Ensure and giving it to her 3x a day. After a week, I went to see her to see if there were any changes. All I can say is WOW!!! Not only was she awake when I went to see her, she recognized me as soon as I entered the room. And here's the really cool part. While I was there visiting, a family member of another resident told me a joke and my mom starting cracking up!! I said, "Wow, mom, you laughed." To which she replied, "Well, it was funny!" I nearly cried! I doubt she'll ever get back to her old self again but if this can help give her a better quality of life, I'll make sure she has a never-ending supply of this wonderful product. Needless to say, I'll be ordering more!

review/summary: It's all about the hair...
review/text: I'm a bi-racial woman with fine naturally curly hair and I've been looking for something that would moisturize without weighing my hair down, so I took to the web and did some research.  COCONUT (my favorite smell) OIL kept coming up, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I've used Olive Oil and found it to be too heavy and it really doesn't smell that great in my opinion.  The day I got the Coconut Oil I put a few tablespoons in a dish, warmed it in the microwave (which I've now found out you shouldn't do, stovetop warming is better) I parted my hair in sections and then brushed the oil in my hair with a hair dye brush, wrapped my head in plastic wrap (attractive right) and let it sit for a couple of hours while I did housework.  When I washed out the oil it only took one shampooing, which surprised me (olive oil always took two) I conditioned and then dried my hair with a blow dryer and smoothed it out with my in-styler and let me tell you my hair was so smooth and silky and shiny! I was amazed! Now mind you my hair isn't in bad condition, not dry or frizzy, I do color it dark brown because I have to cover those grays.  I used to get some poof in the crown area, but after the coconut oil there is none.  I use it once a week and I've noticed that my hair is fuller as well, very happy with the product and the results! I have 3 daughters with very thick curly hair and I use it for them as well.  The oil can also be used on skin and it's not greasy at all.

review/summary: Coconut oil: Good for what ails ya!
review/text: Nope that isn't a snake oil banter. Coconut oil is actually good for you. I have about a tablespoon every other day just because coconut oil can act as a laxative if taken in excess. I also use half a teaspoon of coconut oil as a skin moisturizer; my skin is so soft, I spend a few minutes almost-molesting myself. And unexpected benefit from it was my elbows lightened in color. Since I was a kid my elbows have been tar black, and my folks never let up about it. I've been smearing coconut oil pretty heavily on my elbows for a few nights right before going to bed. Just the other day I flashed my elbow to my mother, and she almost cried. I'm now heavily smearing coconut oil all over dark/chaffed areas on my skin. Coconut oil is also good for softening up rough patches of skin and for people suffering from yeast infections.<br /><br />I haven't gotten to cooking savory food with coconut oil yet, but only because I'm not certain about wanting something so dessert-like in my dinner. Plus my mom and/or brother would strangle me if I added/cooked with coconut oil.

review/summary: Love this stuff... it is the real deal!
review/text: I ordered this jar because it was a great deal, if it was the "good stuff". By good stuff I mean cold pressed or expeller pressed and tasting and smelling like coconuts! I bought some crap from walmart cheap (for coconut oil at least) and it was nasty. Very greasy and yellowish and it didn't taste or smell like coconuts. I have bought and buy coconut oil from the Natural Grocers Vitamin Cottage, but it is expensive. It tastes amazing and smells amazing and I wanted some like that but for a better price so I could actually afford it! I would buy it on sale for $7.99 for 16 oz. This I bought for $20.99 for 54 oz.<br /><br />For the actual review on this coconut oil....<br /><br />I LOVE it! it tastes and smells just like my expensive stuff from the health food store at a fraction of the cost. Also, if you buy 3 of them at a time you get free shipping! I didn't do that this time because I didn't want that much oil if it was going to be nasty. I am totally buying 3 next time though! I totally recommend this product if you are looking for a cheaper alternative to the great tasting and smelling coconut oil. I use this to eat with (a spoonful a day as a supplement) as well as to cook with, and to make natural lotions, and scrubs, diaper cream, etc.

It will last me a long time.<br />It is such a healthy oil and helps the body in many ways.<br />One thing I did not expect was a coconut smell/taste.<br />I wasn't familiar with the types of processing they use with this oil.  It is extra virgin and that is no doubt why it has a slight taste/smell.  When I open the jar it reminds me of a Mounds Candy bar.  I don't mix it in with other foods because of the slight taste. I use it on oatmeal and really it would be good on any warm cereal.

I bought 41/2oz, 6oz and 12oz glass jars ad broke up the 54oz into smaller jars, labeled them (so we aren't using the same jar as butt cream for the baby and cooking dinner) which this oil does help with diaper rash...My 16yr old added some scent to her 4oz jar and loves it...Makes me feel good to be using a product on my children that I can lick off my fingers INSTEAD of running to scrub it off (destin or other butt cremes)<br /><br />Great buy for my money

I mixed some coconut oil in with my regular conditioner and what a difference it's made!  It doesn't leave my hair oily, but nice and soft and shiny.<br /><br />I also have dry skin.  I mixed some of the oil into my lotion and again... my skin isn't left feeling oily, but very soft.  It's even smoothed out some of the smoker's wrinkles around my lips.  I actually rub straight oil on my face and even my feet right before bed.  It's amazing at the difference it's made.<br /><br />I can't comment on the weight loss issues or if it helps the memory as some people have said, because, as I said above, I didn't take it like I was supposed to.  But I really do like cooking with it.  It has just enough coconut flavor to give a little extra hint of flavor, but not so much that it changes the flavors of your foods.  I use it instead of butter on baked potatoes, pancakes (didn't even need syrup) and toast.<br /><br />When I ordered this time I did so straight from their website because I wanted a smaller container for my son and his family to try, as well as a couple of other things I wanted, so I got free shipping.  I love free shipping!  :)<br /><br />I don't do autoships.  I don't like them and normally don't care for a product enough to schedule autoships.  I did on this.  That and the 5 star rating are pretty high recommendations coming from me.

Along with many other properties and benefits of coconut oil. Coconut oil is suppose to clear cobwebs out of your brain helps clear away brain fog and attacks and reverses Alzheimer's disease . Virgin coconut oil cleans your liver and does wonders for your intestines and digestive tract. I wont be buying a moisturizer nor body lotion or hand cream. I am going to throw all my bottles of chemical filled oils out. I took some oil out of the container and placed it in a jar. I use it all over my body. If you want something a bit more add some shea butter and mix together. You can use it on your lips and hair. I am pleased with my purchase and took the time to let others know that this was a good purchase for me.

review/summary: With Coconut Oil, Skin Care is no Toil
review/text: I purchased Vitacost extra virgin coconut oil after learning of the health benefits of louric acid, abundantly present in the oil. Being from the Commonwealth Caribbean, I am used to cooking with coconut oil and other uses of the product. But I was astonished at the results used after using coconut oil as a skin moisturizer. In one week, my hands went for ashy to sassy to classy. A woman told me I had beautiful hands. Even more impressive was the improved tone and suppleness of my skin after three weeks. A lot of fellas don't realize that as a man you have to keep your dermatological situation moisturized. My lady approves, saying that my skin was soft and smooth when we met in Spain. I purchased a Vitacost oil and sent it to her in Chile.<br />I genetically inherited good skin from my family. But the oil noticeably improved my skin's smoothness and suppleness. My cousin, a guy, saw me one day and said "You look great and refreshed." I instantly uttered two words: coconut oil. I advised him to get it. He got his Vitacost oil. Two week later I saw him. He said thank you so much for the coconut oil recommendation. I used it as a moisturizer and on my hair. I love it. My girlfriend tells me my skin is smoother. She is using it now. She had some dry skin issues that have disappeared after using the oil. I said: I know. From now on, coconut oil and I are inseparable partners for life, with coconut is my oil wife. Vitacost brand is high quality and low cost. Just look at the other brands. It gets two thumbs up and five stars.

review/summary: Healthy & Organic...Good for you!
review/text: Besides being good for you, being organic it also tastes great! It's great in adding flavor too your favorite foods and is easy to digest. I use it to replace butter. I enjoy using it on my hot cereals, it adds just a bit of a scent of coconut. Raw fudge is another great way to use this favorable oil. The size of the container gives you enough of the product to last you a few months if not longer (depending on how much you use everyday) It works wonderfully as a conditioner for your hair, gives that little bit of coconut scent. It's a plus to know it is truly "certified organic." Had no problem with the packaging.  Paula

review/summary: prefer it over Nutiva
review/text: This coconut oil is much smoother and creamier than the Nutiva coconut oil. I love it. It's easier to spoon up. I am a little bummed that it's not available anymore. I hope it comes back.

review/summary: It simply works
review/text: I ordered this coconut oil 6 weeks ago and have been using it since day 1. The results are amazing, I have much better skin it is smooth, radiating, and not doesnt feel tacky at all. From my observation, taking a tablespoon of coconut oil every meal 4-5 times a day help to reduce underlying fat in my belly. I am 5'10 165 lbs trying to get the rid of that last bid of fat and I can see the result. Combine this with regular workout it's perfect. I cannot express enough benefits of it. You just gotta try.

review/summary: Delicious at a great price!
review/text: I looked around on Amazon and other places on the Internet, and I believe this is a very good price for extra virgin organic coconut oil. It arrived in a timely manner and was shipped free because we bought over $50 dollars worth of stuff from Vitacost. I've already used some for eating and also for cosmetic purposes and it is wonderful.  It smells and tastes delicious. It definitely has the coconut smell and flavor, which I greatly enjoy. The consistency is smooth and creamy at around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. If the area in which you store the oil is around or above 75 degrees farenheit, though, it will probably get a little more soupy in consistency because it has a low-temp melting point. I will definitely be buying this from Vitacost again when we run out, unless their price increases significantly.

review/text: Thank you so much for offering this product at such an affordable price. My family goes through coconut oil like nobody's business and I am very pleased to have found a source where we can continue our coconut oil habit without going broke. :) As for quality, this is up to par with the brands I have previously purchased from various health food stores. No leaks, no packaging problems. Perfect. I couldn't ask for better. Again, THANK YOU!

review/summary: Vitacost is a good product
review/text: I like this product because of increased engery. Helping me lose a few more pounds of weight. With 2,000 calorie diet and excerise. But i do have to say, you have to follow the supplement plan regliously. Also you should build up to doing the full doses of the coconut oil. lot easier on the body to get use to. I say its worth a shot to try and see what happens.

review/summary: HAIRBALL aid-Helps cats with getting enough fiber
review/text: My cat suffers from hairballs in the spring shedding season.  I had read that squash and pumpkin baby food helps add fiber to the cats diet.  She likes the spoonful I add to her food and it does seem to help with the dreaded hairballs. I know most people reading this will be concerned about human babies-but my furry kid is important to me.

review/summary: Got the subscription.  My twins both like this one
review/text: When I first tried out the variety pack, this Winter Squash was one of the flavors that my twin babies instantly liked.  I started getting subscriptions for some of the flavors one at a time.  As they're getting bigger and eating more, I've added subscriptions.  We've run out at times and were forced to buy at the store, and I'm now determined to just keep those subscriptions going and not run out again.  I don't have a store nearby that beats the subscription price and with twins, I'm more than happy to get the packages delivered and have fewer errands. (As an aside, I'm personally beat and have learned even greater respect for parents in general.  With twins, one gets humbled in short order.  When I see how other parents manage, I'm always in awe at how good they are.)  The jars arrive very well packaged and I've never had any problems personally.  They come 12 in a box, the box is completely wrapped in lots bubble wrap so well that I need scissors to open the actual bubble wrap, and finally in a strong larger box.<br /><br />I have added this one knowing they like it and will readily eat it.  My other 4 oz. subscriptions are: carrots, lentil and rice, chicken dinner and sweet potato.  Soon I expect to add fruit flavors but the pediatrician advised to wait on fruit jars until they're just a little older and to start out with the vegetable ones.  The chicken dinner, which is really chicken with brown rice, was also advised but it has more squash than chicken.  When we ordered that, we crossed the threshold and departed from a vegetarian diet for our now 8+ month old babies.  We are not vegetarians but consume very little meat and poultry, so I guess our babies follow our personal guidelines, although as an ideal we'd eventually be vegetarians.  The only reason I didn't order the squash subscription earlier was that the chicken dinner has so much squash in it.<br /><br />What I've also discovered is that the features included in managing one's subscriptions (within My Account) are very good.  You can tell them you're out and want the next one sooner and several other options as well.  I've got several other subscriptions, such as baby formula and also some supplements for the adults in the household, and find the managing subscription feature very handy.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Organic winter squash, water necessary for processing.<br /><br />This has 40 calories, 5% protein, 100% vitamin A, 20% vitamin C, 4% calcium and 2% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/summary: Great taste and good nutrition
review/text: I feed both my kids Earth's Best brand baby/toddler food when I am unable to prepare food myself.  All flavors have a short list of ingredients, good flavor and a nice nutrition profile.<br /><br />I usually wrap these jars in a ziplock bag with a baby spoon and stash in the diaper bag for wholesome food on the go.  I like to feed my toddler what my husband or I eat, but it is great having a back-up if she is really not hip to the entree.<br /><br />Earths Best is the next best thing to mom's cooking ;)<br /><br />Off label use:<br />If you are out of oil when making baked goods, like pumpkin muffins, you can add a jar of complimentary flavored baby food in a pinch and they will still come out moist! Happy accidents are worth sharing!

review/summary: Thick, good texture, fresh tasting, baby loves it.
review/text: This is my daughter's favorite baby food flavor and one of the two we will keep on subscription (spinach and potatoes is her other favorite).  The flavor is bland (as is most baby food) but fresh. The texture is nice and thick so a big bite will stay on the spoon and not drip all over the place.  This is nice for older babies (9+ months) because some of the pureed foods are too thin and basically liquid.  Squash is a healthy, non-starchy, vegetable and I'm happy my daughter is developing a taste for it at a young age.
