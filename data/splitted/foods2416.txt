review/summary: Nice on ice with fresh mint or spices
review/text: I drink a lot of tea these days and when the weather is hot, consume iced tea constantly throughout the day.  Being very sensitive to caffeine, I find that my yummy black and green teas raise my blood pressure and keep me awake often for much longer than I'd like.  Herbal teas are fantastic and I enjoy them immensely, but for a low cost decaf common orange pekoe/black tea option, I brew the Lipton Decaffeinated Black Tea, using usually 3 bags in a pot of boiled water.  Since I have a seemingly perpetual supply of mint, I add a spring to the glass with a Splenda and I'm set.  For a simple chai, I add an assortment of cardamom, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger, depending upon my mood and I top it off with skim milk.  The 48 count boxes are attractive to me because they don't take up much space after the box is opened and I don't need to put the bags in anything other than the lightweight original box.  I also enjoy sharing with neighbors and find the box to be a perfect size as opposed to larger boxes which I might not be so inclined to share.  When Amazon offers these on sale, you can't beat the cost for reliable and simple tea in bags.  It may not be the finest tea in the world, but it is well worth the cost for an adequate tea.

review/summary: Misleading Photo!
review/text: The description states 48 tea bags, and the photo shows family sized tea bags. I always buy family sized and thought I was getting an AWESOME deal, but when they came in it was 12 boxes of 48 tea bags...but they were the itty bitty small size bags. So, this is actually not a good deal at all for me. At least it wasn't MORE expensive then in the store, but it still wasn't a good deal. We make a LOT of tea EVERY day and I absolutely hate opening all those little tea bags. But oh well, they will all be gone eventually!!! Very disappointed in this VERY MISLEADING photo. That shouldn't be aloud. Almost criminal. haha.

Good tea and a good value, especially when you can take advantage of the bonus coupon Amazon offers now and again.<br /><br />I've found Lipton excells as an iced tea, especially when you sun brew it (just fill a large glass jar with water, add a few bags, cover it, and set it in the sun for a few hours). Very mellow, full-body taste. Goes great with a touch of lemon or mint.

review/summary: Excellent tea when you want something soothing or when you've got that miserable cold!!!
review/text: Lipton Decaffeinated Tea is the perfect thing to drink when you want a soothing hot--or cold--beverage. It works wonders to combat laryngitis as well. This tea contains 100% natural orange pekoe and orange pekoe black teas. Moreover, the tea bags contain decaffeinated tea which means you'll never lose a night's sleep to this tea! SMILE<br /><br />Moreover, there are no additives nor are there preservatives. You can use these tea bags a very long time after you bought them in a store or here at Amazon.com online. Amazon states that this tea has antioxidants and in fact it does--but the antioxidants are in the form of flavonoids which are all natural antioxidants. Scientists still need to conduct more research on this topic; but there is growing evidence at the time of this writing that flavonoids reduce the risk for coronary heart disease as well as the risk of gastric, esophageal and skin cancers. Tea flavonoids can also improve your body's immune system.<br /><br />Yes, you can serve this tea iced with lemon; but I normally find it most useful for those nasty winter months when I inevitably catch a miserable cold. I boil water; I add the tea bag and then I let it steep for a few minutes. I add milk and one packet of "sweet and low" and it's absolutely delicious!<br /><br />The price is right, too: the cost per tea bag works out to be about 17 cents per tea bag. You can use a tea bag twice if you wish but after two uses the tea bag has probably served its' "tour of duty."<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine quality tea that will not over stimulate you with caffeine. It is an aromatic hot beverage for when you have a cold and it also makes a delicious iced tea drink on a baking--hot summer's day. Pick some up and try it--you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />SMILE

review/text: ...as is most tea that you buy in a grocery store.  If you want good, full flavored tea, don't get Lipton or most of the other run of the mill store brands.  Go for Traditional Medicinals, Good Earth or order loose leaf tea from somewhere like Adagio Teas.  You may pay a little more but you'll get real tea that tastes really good.  You'll wonder how you were able to drink stuff like this for so long.

review/text: I thought the green tea tapioca pearls were delicious! They are of the faster cooking variety than some brands (I want to say around 20 min, but I can't quite remember), and the texture is chewy and fab. Make sure you get bubble tea straws as well.<br /><br />I have since found them in my local Asian market for $1.99, so if you have one near you, don't be afraid to check it out! Oh yeah, they had bubble tea straws there, too.<br /><br />I used them to make a much healthier version of bubble tea using fresh or frozen fruit rather than a flavored syrup:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I recommend this product.

review/text: On one hand, the bubbles are quite good. Please do not get me wrong, the product in that sense is great.<br /><br />That said, it is also somewhat deceiving of a marketing setup. As far as I could tell, the "Green Tea" tapioca pearl had hardly any flavor over regular bubbles. The "green tea powder" is really more of a color effect than a flavor effect.<br /><br />I would rate this perhaps a 4, if the product was also a good value. But it's more expensive than other bubble tea products, and I was mistaken to believe it was some sort of "convenience product" that justified the price. Nope, it's just some pretty looking (and relatively good) bobbas.

review/text: Each packet makes about 3/4 cup of soup, which is smaller than I expected. The miso itself is white, rather than the brown shown on the packaging. The miso has a decent flavor, though. I'm more disappointed with the other elements of the soup, such as the tofu and seaweed. The soup doesn't contain very many of these extras, and the items that are there are chopped into pieces that are too tiny to really taste.

review/summary: Pretty good for instant, but not the best.
review/text: Miso-Cup is pretty alright, though honestly I've had at least one brand of freeze-dried instant miso soup that was better. In its defense, I've had a lot more of the Miso-Cup than the other brands though since I bought a whole case for just myself. The product benefits from being less expensive despite the fact that it's organic.<br /><br />The basic flavor is what you would expect from red miso, but it has a hint of a dry-ish or even paper-y taste or mouth feel that never really goes away, even if you let it hydrate for a long time. I suspect it comes from the packaging; it's especially prevalent in the pieces of tofu it comes with. Despite the high sodium content, it still seems to need something, salt or some other thing to give it more body. The wakame is plentiful enough when you're eating it, but it comes in very small pieces and the soup also comes with very small slivers of green onion, I imagine this is to facilitate it being consumed from a cup, but it seems very mechanical when juxtaposed with the fact that it's certified organic. The onion seems to contribute a lot more than the wakame to this particular formulation. I appreciate that it is organic, but I usually expect the organic stuff to be about as good as the non-organic stuff if not better.<br /><br />That said, it doesn't taste bad, so you won't regret your decision to buy it, but it's not as good as more expensive brands. I'd recommend it if you really like miso frequently but can't make your own and can't stomach shelling out more than a dollar per 8 ounce serving.

review/summary: Don't Buy -- Dreadful!
review/text: I like Miso soup and just love the same product from San-J (also available from Amazon -- get it, it's 5-star!).<br /><br />This Miso-cup brand is terrible. I can't tell you more than this is just yicky. I wish there was a zero-star rating!<br /><br />I didn't finish the first cup even (but I'd already tried and re-tried another Miso-cup flavor and hated it). Therefore, I only used one envelope before giving away the rest. Oh, why did I stray from San-J? Actually, I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cup's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience. But ALL the Miso-cup were equally dreadful!!!<br /><br />I gave these and the other Miso-cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them. Get the San-J brand!!!

review/summary: Not just for toast!
review/text: I found this in my local gourmet store and decided to give it a go. They call it ginger spread and that is exactly what it is. This is ginger jam; the ginger is peeled and cooked down and pureed. It is distinctly different from other producers' ginger spreads which are closer to jellies or marmalades.<br /><br />It is absolutely wonderful for adding flavor to dishes. I love it in baked goods especially because it incorporates well, whereas the more jelly-like preserves tend to stay as clumps. It blends well and infuses the entire dish with its sweet kick. If you like or love ginger, you have to give this a try! It can also be dissolved in a cup of hot water like a tisane. Use it to sweeten a cup of tea and add a kick!

review/text: This is great stuff. We used to get it at our local Whole Foods Market, but they stopped carrying it. So now we get it on line. My only complaint is that they use sugar to sweeten it. I guess ginger needs a little sweetening, but we don't need this much, and agave nectar would be less harmful to our health.

I usually prepare it with lemon and honey, and it's a very soothing blend with hints of mint and eucalyptas.

review/summary: Finally something that works!!!
review/text: I have had to put up with constant sore throats (about 150-200 days out of every year) and catching every bug that was going around the office for years. Needless to say, it was having a huge negative impact on my life. I tried many different types of Echinacea pills, extracts, etc but they never seemed to help. So I finally gave up on Echinacea. I had some success with zinc lozenges/sprays and then one day I found this Echinacea/zinc tea and decided I would give it a try. I was feeling like I was coming down with something that day so I had a cup of this tea and the next day I was feeling great! And it seems to work every time, as long as I take it at the first sign of a sore throat or when I feel like my natural defenses are weakening. I don't know if it's the placebo effect or what, but who cares? It works when other products didn't have any effect. I now have a sore throat maybe 3 or 4 days a year. This product, among others, has changed the quality of my life. I now buy it for my entire family. Highly recommended.

review/text: I bought this tea to help ward off colds and flu this season.  So far, I have not been sick while all of my staff have been out from 1 to 6 days with the flu.  For me, this tea took some getting use too but I now enjoy it daily and look forward to my one or two cups a day.<br /><br />This tea has a strong peppermint or euclypatic taste to it.  A taste that I was not use to but after the first few sips, the peppermint taste was not as strong and I really think this tea helps reduce congestion.  Only thing I add to this tea is 1 teaspoon of honey.  I have shared it with both sisters and my mom and they really like it.<br /><br />Give it a try, the health benefits are worth it and after that first sinus opening sip, the taste grows on you!

review/summary: This stuff actually works!
review/text: I wouldn't have thought it if I hadn't tried it, but this stuff actually works. I started taking it about a day after I started experiencing cold symptoms. My symptoms got only a little worse, much less than they normally do when I get a cold, and then I was feeling better within a couple of days. I really didn't think it would work as well as it did.<br /><br />The active ingredients are vitamin C (60% RDA), Zinc (50% RDA), Echinacea, Eucalyptus, and stevia. Other ingredients are peppermint, licorice, roasted chicory, natural menthol extract, lavender and Chinese star anise. The taste is okay, but I prefer it warm with a bit stevia and vanilla-flavored almond milk. I imagine it would also taste good with honey. Three cups a day, and my symptoms went away. I didn't really think it possible before, but I do now.

review/summary: Milder than most of the bold flavors with a slight  zing of lime citrus flavor!
review/text: These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!

review/summary: Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?
review/text: These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. "BOLD" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure!

review/text: I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I've never seen the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor at the local grocery store so when I saw them on Amazon I decided to buy them.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. This is right up there with my favorite flavors. It has just enough heat and jalapeno flavor with just a little bit of smoke. To me, these have almost as much heat as the Habanero flavor. Which isn't a bad thing. I like spicy.<br /><br />I would defiantly recommend these if you like the Bold line of Blue Diamond Almonds.

review/summary: Not habanero-y at all, but still insanely addicting
review/text: The heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help. These are not like that. Only occasionally will you get a little kick. It's actually mostly tangy and tomato-y. The dusting of flavoring on the outside of the nuts will coat your fingers in an orange film.<br /><br />Satisfyingly crunchy and tangy, it's really hard to stop eating these. Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving. High in Vitamin E (35%) and magnesium (20%). This 1 pound bag (x3 bags) is a great deal compared to buying the 6 oz tins at the store, however, when my local Walgreens has buy 1 get 1, the price drops to about $0.35/oz.<br /><br />Blue Diamond makes about 8 other flavors that I know of. My favorites are the Soy Wasabi, Honey Roasted, Smokehouse, Dijon Mustard.

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: I'm a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the "bold" flavors.<br /><br />The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that says the tartness of the lime flavor is just enough to bring out the chili flavor. Its a nice balance.<br /><br />I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom.

review/text: When I first tried these tasty almonds, I was amazed at the great marriage of flavor. Has the kick of wasabi, and the sweet taste of roasted almonds. The first one is an eye opener each time even after you have had them many times. Bold and fun! If you like sushi, and you enjoy the taste of wasabi, these are for you.

review/summary: Best flavor and best price of any Blue Diamond almonds!
review/text: The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting. They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering. Compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable.

review/text: I was concerned that these might be too hot, 'Habanero', but the heat is perfect as is the flavor... they are bold, if you like stuff plain--these are not for you... but if you like a robust flavor, a definite must!  Took some to the office and my office is all addicted by these now, you can't eat just one.  From a texture perspective, they are perfectly roasted - not chewy and not powdery, they are crisp.  I'm on a Paleolithic 'Paleo' diet and nuts like these are okay for me to eat - so they make a great treat.  I've gone through 7 bags in 3 months (sharing, of course)... I definitely recommend.

review/summary: Highly addictive! Great with beer
review/text: I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!

review/text: Hello everyone, I just had to write a review for these Wasabi and Soy Sauce flavored Blue Diamond Almonds, because I enjoy them sooooooo much! I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond. The flavor is fantastic, as it is spicy but not so much to bring tears to your eyes. Also, the price of this product is great as well. Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving. Treat yourself to these awesome almonds today!

review/summary: The best almond flavor out there. How could something so delish be so good for you?
review/text: The "Jalapeno Smokehouse" flavor is the best flavor in the Blue Diamond "BOLD" series, hands down. Unlike some of the other flavors, this one really tastes like what it's supposed to taste like -- that is to say, smoky jalapeno peppers. To my jaded taste buds, the pepper spice is fairly mild, but I imagine most people find it packs quite a kick. It's a good thing these huge, perfectly roasted nuts are great for you, because I eat them constantly. Hey, my HDL cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol) has actually risen as I've gotten older. I like to think it's partly because of these luscious babies. Dr Jeddy prescribes a handful every day!

I love salt, I love vinegar, and I love salt-and-vinegar potato chips, so how could I lose with these?<br /><br />Well, I'm just not that into them. The flavor's great and the almonds are fresh, but somehow the texture just fails. The almonds just seem... soggy. They don't have that wonderful crunch that the other Blue Diamond flavors have. And that flattens out the whole experience of eating them. I've eaten about 10 bags so far, and they all have the same lackluster texture.<br /><br />Oh well. Guess even my ol' reliable Blue Diamond can't hit it out of the park every time.

review/summary: Great Low Carb snack to go!!
review/text: Before we switched to eating low carb, we used to LOVE a nice big bag of chips.  I was missing those zesty salty crunchy snacks, until we found these delicious almonds!  I have tried all of the flavors and love them all, but these are my current favorite.  I like the snack size packs as a reminder that I have had enough since I can never stop eating them (just like potato chips, no one can eat just one).  A whole package is only  8 grams of carbs (only 4 grams of net carbs if you are an Atkins dieter).  These almonds have a nice crisp texture (even better if you put them in the refrigerator for a bit) and the seasoning is evenly distributed.  Not to strong, but also not too weak that it gets lost on the almonds. A package of 12 only lasted about a week in our home, back to order more.

review/summary: A healthy addiction
review/text: Not generally a big fan of wasabi or of almonds, but somehow find these particular wasabi and soy sauce almonds to be a healthy addiction. My doctor recommended almonds as an excellent low-carb, high protein, high fiber snack with heart healthy fat and this flavor is great to meet that suggestion while providing a nice savory and spicy snack with a little salty crunch.  A little bit spicy but not too much (I don't tolerate really spice foods well).  I tried the smokehouse flavor by the same brand and didn't like it, but I could live on these wasabi and soy sauce almonds. The soy sauce flavor is hardly noticeable but just nicely tones down the heat of the wasabi.

review/summary: Soooo addicting
review/text: I've been participating in Weight Watchers for the last couple months (doing well).  I like to have a healthy snack at work mid-afternoon so I bought a bag of these at the grocery store.  They are so good I can't stop at 23 (a serving size).  I am not going to buy these again until I'm at my goal because I can't stop eating them.  They are quite salty so if you are trying to control your sodium, beware.  They are not as "hot" as wasabi peas, a more gentle kick.  I highly recommend them. Very savory.

review/summary: I'm an addict!  Great for low carb
review/text: These are the tastiest of all the Blue Diamond flavors out there, in my opinion!  Just the right combination of vinegar sourness and salty goodness.<br /><br />Plus they're a very healthy low-carb snack.  The tin is just the right size, and the lid keeps them fresh for a few weeks (not that they tend to last that long!)

review/summary: Limey
review/text: I really enjoy the Jalapeno flavor.  The Wasabi flavor was just a step behind that.  But this lime and chili flavor...I think I would only enjoy it with a beer.  The lime flavor is just way to intense.  I will not be ordering this flavor again.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: Better tasting then just about any potato chip and tons healthier too, especially for low carb diets. These things are just amazing. The lime and chili flavors are equally bold and complement the flavor of the almond quite nicely. Highly recommended.  They have some other flavors that may be worth trying too.

review/text: Eaten alone these flavored almonds are a bit overpowering (pretty tart, but I love 'em). However, if you put them in a large container with other flavored nuts, such as lime 'n chili, along with raw almonds, cashews, walnuts whatever, the spices are spread among all the other nuts. A great snack. It was also cheaper and easier to get them through Amazon than to run all over town trying to find a store that carries the flavors I want.

review/text: I could live off of these things, they are soooo good!  I usually get mine at the supermarket, but this 6-pack deal is a great idea for addicts like myself.  I guess the wasabi flavor is a bit weak, but that's perfect for me because although I love the flavor of horseraddish, it destroys my sinuses! lol

review/summary: Delicious AND Nutritious
review/text: These have a great combination of salt and vinegar which makes neither aspect overwhelming. They are insanely addictive and they go well with dried fruits like raisins to give some contrast to the salt. They are also high in fiber which makes up for their fat content to some extent.

review/summary: Zesty Deliciousness in a Can
review/text: I love these.  They have exactly the right amount of spice/flavoring (which is probably too much) and I used to buy the 1.5oz package daily with lunch, but buying them in bulk makes so much more sense.  Yum!  The empty cans are good for storing loose hardware and small things around the house.

review/text: Found these by accident - they are so tasty. Very hard to find in local grocery stores, so I was happy to find them on Amazon.com.  Will probably be ordering more.<br /><br />4/2/11 - I have since bought 3 more cases. I took some to work and everyone wanted to know where I got them. They asked me to sell them some when I get another shipment.

review/summary: Great Flavored Almonds, Hard to Get
review/text: This particular flavor of Blue Diamond almonds generally doesn't show up in grocery stores in this size cans. The occasional quick shop/gas station may carry them in the small bags. I travel and I look every time. It may not be everybody's favorite, but I'm sure glad I can get them in bulk.

review/summary: LOOOOVE these almonds!
review/text: I am so thrilled to find these on Amazon! I don't know why it didn't occur to me to look earlier. I love salt and vinegar potato chips and these definitely hit the same flavor spot. But it's a much healthier alternative. They are still high in fat, as all nuts are, so eating a whole can in one sitting is probably not the thing to do. But a handful in the afternoon really takes care of my salt craving, the bold vinegar flavor makes a little go a long way and I'm getting some good nutrients too. As others mentioned, of all the "bold" flavors, this seems to be the one that is hardest to find in stores. Thank you, Amazon!

review/summary: Best Almonds Ever
review/text: I recently discovered the Salt & Vinegar Almonds they are delicious. The individual size is perfect for when on the go. I also purchased the cans for at home. Almonds are a very heart healthy snack, just try to limit yourself to a few a day. For my taste I would like to have more vinegar flavor.
