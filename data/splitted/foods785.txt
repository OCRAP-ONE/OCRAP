review/summary: Good Trail Mix in Good Packages
review/text: This is a fantastic low-sodium, low-sugar snack.  It tastes better than most trail mixes, and has healthier ingredients (like sunflower seeds).  I usually eat some before going to the gym because it has a bunch of protein and just a little bit of carbs.<br /><br />The packages are very small, compared to some trail mix - but because it is organic, this mix still represents a good value for the price.  The little resealable bags are handy for keeping the mix fresh.

review/text: This mix has everything that I want and none of what I don't want. Most mixes have too much salt in them for me. I like the unsalted ones so that I can add a little bit if I want.

review/summary: Okay Mix, Not Great
review/text: I was a bit disappointed when I received these.  I'm only glad I paid the subscription price and not the regular price!  The individual bags themselves are pretty small.  I had never had this mix before.  It is difficult to eat since the pieces are so small!  Especially the blueberries and sunflower seeds.  And this mix definitely has A LOT of sunflower seeds.  Will probably not buy again as there are other nut/berry mixes I like much better.

review/summary: Great Snack - 100% Organic - Lots of Berries and Nuts
review/text: There are a LOT of almonds, pumpkin seeds and nuts in this snack mix which is so nice, since typically trail mixes are heavy on cheap nuts like peanuts and too many raisins.  This is a good and hearty snack mix with plenty of dried blueberries - my favorite part of the mix! So many trail mixes are mostly full of raisins - but this mix has a generous amount of berries and good quality organic nuts - it is a great price and I put it on my Subscribe and Save list.<br /><br />  I use this mix as a base for cookie dough - a great short cut for cookie baking.<br /><br />  I love all products made by Eden Natural Foods.  This company was a pionner in the beginning days of the organic food industry.  Founded in the late 1960's (forgot exact date, ooops) by Michael Potter.  I've been eating 100% organic since 1969 and it i so unfortunate 95% of big national organic food companies have been sold to Pillsbury, Kraft, General Mills, Kellogg - Odwalla Juice is owned by Coca cola, Naked Juice owned by Kraft, a very long list and the saddest one is Burts Bee's was sold to Clorox (ugh!).  Eden is one of the very few big national organic food companies which refused to sell out to huge corporations which make junk food.  I admire the integrity of Eden Foods and have been a customer since they were founded a zillion years ago!<br /><br />  Check out Eden brand dried Montmorency organic dried cherries - phenomenal - plus they make Montmorency organic jam spread and Eden cherry juice - unfiltered and very intense flavor which is SO rich I dilute it with some spring water.  Michigan is known as growing the best cherries in America, if not the world - and Eden Foods is in Clinton Michigan so the crop is harvested and then turned into product quickly - exceptionally good flavor!

review/summary: Awesome Trail mix!
review/text: I was looking for a healthy trail mix and this product was recommended by a fitness trainer.  In addition, I've also learned the makers of this product go above and beyond the USDA standards of 'Organic labeling'.  I have placed my 2nd order (actually have this on auto ship!) and am looking forward to its arrival.  This is by far the healthiest trail mix I have found.  It's full of wonderful surprises and is incredibly palatable!  I often share this product with my friends, and now several of them are on hooked on it as well!

review/summary: Raisins??
review/text: I was attempting to fill a family member's Christmas request for "Gourmet brand of dark chocolate covered raisins".  I agreed to pay a standard shipping charge of almost 50%.  The product arrived in 6 days in a USPS standard envelope that was badly torn by our postal service.  The raisins, however, were sealed in a clear plastic bag that had not been torn so I concluded they were sanitary.  They looked like large, juicy raisins covered by a smooth coating of very dark chocolate.  There was no documentation whatsoever except the Amazon shipping label. Since I couldn't just wrap a flimsy plastic bag that was supposed to pass as a gourmet product, I went out and got a fancy container that cost almost as much as the raisins.  Unfortunately the container was too small to hold the entire 2 lbs of raisin.  My solution was to open the plastic and fill the container using about 90% of the raisins.  I wrapped the gift and it now sits under the tree.<br /><br />Now, what do you do with the left over raisins?  At least my trouble was to be rewarded by getting to taste the product. The chocolate was delicious.... so was the caramel on the inside.  The problem was that they weren't any raisins at all.  I was all chocolate and caramel.  Anyway, it makes for a good story.  I'm just not sure that I would buy from Marich again.

review/summary: New formula ruined this gum
review/text: This used to be a delicious and healthy product until Peelu changed the formula.  Now the gum starts disintegrating when first chewed, all the flavor disappears almost immediately, and then it turns into a tasteless hard lump.  In addition, the healthy ingredient Xylitol (which used to be 100%) has been partially replaced with rebiana (a possibly unhealthy sugar substitute).  I can only hope that Peelu will one day go back to the original formula. I would never again purchase it otherwise, and would certainly not recommend it.

review/text: I have been taught my Italian family's recipe for "gravy," what I used to call spaghetti sauce. The recipe includes tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, a little wine, garlic, some Italian herbs--and tomato paste. Put it all together and it is a tasy topping for pasta (the family favorite is linguini, but we also use it over tortellini, penne, farfalle, fusilli, and ravioli).<br /><br />The Contadina tomate paste (with Italian herbs) is one of the key components of this gravy.

I paid just $15.00 for two 34.5 ounce containers of this coffee a few months ago and the cost included free shipping from Amazon! Now the price is twice that. What happened? I want my cheap coffee back, Amazon! As far as the coffee goes, no it is not going to win any coffee-phile awards. This coffee is great for what it is: fine tasting low-cost coffee. If you drink coffee by the gallon every day like I do (and you aren't made of money) this is an excellent choice. Now, again the price was half of what it is now so I will have to wait before I can buy some more :(

review/summary: This is essentially the Heinz Ketchup You Grew Up On
review/text: Without getting into a discussion of how "organic" it is or isn't.  There is one crucial thing you need to know about this product: for about 100 years Heinz ketchup (like Coca-Cola) was sweetened with sugar when a switch was made to high-fructose corn syrup.  Cheaper due to government farm subsidies for Heinz to use but not the same taste.  This Heinz Organic Ketchup uses sugar like the old days and the taste is instantly noticeable.  That's why we buy it.  The fact that we are reducing our high fructose corn syrup intake is of course a plus.

review/text: I'm not personally a big ketchup fan but am trying to buy more organic products.  I bought the 365 ketchup from Whole Foods and really liked it, not as sweet, more tomato-y flavor.  Unfortunately my 5 year old won't touch the stuff.  I bought this to make her happy and it does.  To me it tastes just like regular Heinz ketchup.  I just wish it came in a 24 or 32 oz bottle.

review/text: We've been trying to cut high fructose corn syrup out of our diet as much as possible, which means really reading labels.<br />This is just basic ketchup, what you're used to with Heinz but without the corn syrup. My children like it a lot, and it's inexpensive.<br />It also cooks well if you use ketchup in any of your recipes.

review/summary: The best ketchup in existence. Period.
review/text: This ketchup tastes better than regular Heinz ketchup. It's hard to beat. When I have regular Heinz ketchup, I can taste a funky chemical wang in it.<br /><br />I thought the taste of the organic was superior because it had sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, but when I tried Hunts ketchup made with sugar, the taste also paled in comparison to Heinz organic. I'm sure that the sugar is a better taste option, but I think the Heinz organic also has a richer tomato flavor.<br /><br />Some have said the color is the same as regular Heinz, but I've noticed that it is a deeper, darker red. I'm wondering if this could indicate a higher lycopene content?<br /><br />Be warned: once you start eating this ketchup, all others won't live up to your new standard. You'll also want to consume more products like oven fries and burgers just so you can slather them in this yummy ketchup.

Because soy is healthy for you and the ad said, "They are better than potato chips", I thought I would give them a try. Now I buy them from Amazon by the boxes.  I enjoy giving a sample to my friends and I have not gotten one word of negative feedback. There are different flavors but I especially like the apple cinnamon. I recommend you give them a try.

review/summary: Low Fat and Few Calories (HEALTHY SNACK); Great Taste
review/text: Glenny's Low Fat Soy Crisps are a healthy snack and I absolutely love them.  Trying to be health conscious and trying to avoid fats, I was looking for snacks that would satisfy both requirements.  I stumbled on these snacks at two (2) places: Dean's Natural Foods stores and Whole Foods.<br /><br />Be careful that you only select the Glenny's that say Low Fat on the label. Why? This is important if you are trying to cut fat out of your diet as well as calories.  There are no saturated fats nor any trans fats nor any cholesterol in the low fat Glennys.  There is only one gram of fat per serving.  And the calorie count is extremely low (only 70 calories per serving) versus for the regular Glennys over 110 to 120 calories per serving.<br /><br />The taste is great and for those who need a crunchy snack sometime during the day; this is a healthy alternative to potato chips or pop corn.  Two small servings which would only be 140 calories and 0 saturated fat would provide you with 10 grams of soy protein, 25 mg of soy isoflavones, 3 grams of dietary fiber and more soy protein than tofu or soy milk.<br /><br />Cosmopolitan Magazine quotes: "Even better than potato chips. Delicious."<br /><br />Additionally, each serving gives you 4% of your daily calcium requirement and 8% of your iron percent daily value. Each serving would be about 10 chips approximately.  I open the 3 ounce bag and separate the contents into ziplock bags (10 chips apiece) so that I can regulate the calories and the amount of fat in my snacks.<br /><br />What is nice for those who are afraid to buy a 3 ounce bag of anything.  Even if you succumbed to eating the entire 3 ounce bag: all would not be lost.  You would be getting 20 grams of protein, 50 mg or soy isoflavones, 6 grams of dietary fiber and 300 calories total in the whole bag.  The taste is great whether you purchase the low fat apple cinnamon, the white cheddar or the lightly salted, the low fat barbeque...all have a great taste.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this snack..great taste.<br /><br />Sample a bag.  I think you will be a fan after that.<br /><br />The 1.3 ounce bags (which are being offered on Amazon) are even better than the 3 ounce (85 gram) bags that I have been purchasing.  You have the bags already divided into individual snack portions with 24 bags in the pack.  Terrific!<br /><br />Bentley/October 2007

I am very dissatisfied with Amazon on this one though.  The product they sent is only 2 months from expiring and it's a 96 pack.  If you go to the grocery store you'll see that the Cheerios there have about a year left on the shelf life so these have clearly been sitting around the warehouse for a while.  Food items are non returnable so if you're not happy with the old stuff that Amazon sends you then you are out of luck.

All you do is add water.<br /><br />Just add one cup of the dry mix to 3/4 cup of water, mix it, and pour the batter in the pitcher. Place the fry ring in the skillet of hot oil and pour the batter in the pan. In less than three minutes, the funnel cake is done and ready for a sprinkling of powdered sugar. I discovered that the funnel cakes are better if you add more batter to make it thicker. Thicker is Better!

When I contacted Amazon they stated that there is nothing that they can do that it is the sellers mistake. (This order ships by Amazon) asked the associate why couldn't have been the fault of Amazon maybe pulling the wrong item (the single and not the 6 pack) or maybe the puller read the order wrong. Absolutely not I was told. Not only that the only way to rectify the situation is to send back the product and then get a refund. Amazon could not refund me the 10.00 nor could they send me 5 more.

Not only is this salad dressing calorie free, fat free, and carb free, it tastes great! I mean really great. Not like..."Ok I'm on a diet and this isn't too bad" great. I'm so happy I can now order online. I always keep two bottles in the pantry.

review/text: My 70+ pound puppy loves this bone, and it's been months since I bought it. The mint stuffing was gone within a couple hours of course. The nice thing about this kind of bone is that you can freshen it up in lots of ways - stuff in a piece of cheese, spritz some spray butter (or even Pam) on it, pour the dregs of your vegetable soup on it, etc., and the dog will fall in love with it again and again. :)

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I ordered this product last September (the 6-pack), and still have 1 full container is spite of drinking iced coffee nearly every day. It tastes great! :) It is so easy to make! The design of the container was very well conceived providing a measure for the perfect glass of iced coffee every time!  I mixed this with vanilla soy milk sometimes for variety, and it also tasted great! Love it, and will order more when this container runs out. :)<br /><br />* One word of caution. Make sure to keep the containers refrigerated or they will explode when you open them. This warning came with the product, but I ignored it with one container and had a rather unwelcome surprise one morning. What can I say? It was my own stupidity... :)

review/text: I like to cook, but a gluten free diet is definitely a challenge especially when thickening is needed.<br /><br />Quinoa flour will brown and thicken for gravy if you stir it well when adding the liquid. On the few occasions when it did not thicken I always relied on Organic corn starch.  The Potatoe starch is better.<br /><br />I make a lot of stir fry. I mix a teaspoon of potatoe starch in gluten free soy sauce and water and stir in for a bit of nice thick sauce before serving over hot rice. Yummy!

review/text: A great tasting drink, and full of things that are good for you.  But I found that I no longer had an appetite.  I checked out the ingredient "Super Citrimax" on the Internet, and found that it is an appetite suppressant.  So I thought perhaps that's why I had lost my appetite.  I have since cut down drastically drinking Fuze, and my appetite seems to be returning slowly.  So if you want to cut down on your eating, this might be the drink for you.  But if you are already a light eater, you might want to proceed with caution.

review/summary: Very tasty low calorie drink
review/text: Fuze has created a tasty, low calorie drink. Originally purchased the Slenderize accidently for my 14 yr old son who tried it and decided he didn't like it, and being the frugal mom, I wasn't going to let it go to waste. I was delighted to find it was delicious. I didn't look at the vitamin count or the calorie count until after my first sip, second or even the third. I looked here on Amazon hoping for an amazing deal, but was disappointed. It is too bad that the shipping here on Amazon is so high, but a 15 lb box isn't cheap to send, I'm sure.

review/text: I'll start off by saying that Nong shim's products in general are of a higher standard than their competitors. Even their noodles have a much better consistency and are more flavorful than other brands such as nissin.  With that said, lets get to the review of the Spicy Picante flavor.<br /><br />The first thing anyone notices when they try this is just how spicy it is.  It is SPICY.  I love spicy foods and this will probably make your nose run.  I absolutely love it though.  If you think it is too spicy, you can probably use less of the seasoning packet.. so theres some room to fit individual taste.<br /><br />The package contains both a seasoning packet and some dried vegetables to add so you can definitely make a meal out of this if you add some egg or something.  I usually just eat it as is.  Overall, I think the flavor is great and I really recommend it for people that like spicy foods. You'll never go back to the cheaper, tasteless stuff again.

review/summary: Ramen connoiseur's review & tips on the Shin Ramen
review/text: Review:<br />I've eaten ramen for a long time (30+ years) and have eaten numerous varieties and the Shin ramen is probably my #1 tasting. The reasons are as follows:<br />* Best flavor broth - it's spicy (but adjustable), leaves a good aftertaste (yes, even when you burp), tint of mushroom flavor coupled with a good balance of red pepper, onions and spices.<br />* Noodles have good texture - depending how you cook them of course but with bad ones, no matter how you cook them they come out soggy/soft. These come out chewy if you want or softer if you overcook them.<br />* It's not oily - I've noticed with some noodles, you can see a ring of oil around the pot after you cook the noodles. So with these I sometimes had to boil an extra pot of water and then transfer the cooked noodles to the fresh pot of water to get rid of the oil. Not with Shin Ramen.<br />* Economical - for less than a dollar a pack, they beat any dollar menu item<br />* Great for any weather - particularly winter to keep you warm. In the summer, they help to break out a sweat and opens your pores<br />* Can be a hearty meal - you can add all types of things to this ramen as others have posted. An egg is recommended but so are vegetables and meat.<br /><br />Tips:<br /><br />Amount of water - add about 2 mug size cup fulls of water. If not sure, add a little less. You can always add more after it's fully cooked. Adding cold water at the end cools down the boiling hot soup so it's easier to eat.<br /><br />How to cook - wait til the water boils. As soon as it does, drop in everything: the soup base, noodles, dried vegie packet. If you want to add vegies, let it cook for about a minute before adding e.g. mushrooms, bean sprouts, tomatoes, green onions. Don't put more than a quarter couple of any vegies or meat cuz you'll kill the flavor. For eggs, if you like them well cooked, add them at the beginning. You can add at the end of cooking too but this is a bit too raw for my taste<br /><br />Cooking time - boil the noodles 2 - 4 minutes. This depends on how hard or soft you like your noodles. Just pull a strand out and taste it every 30 seconds after the first minute. There's no right or wrong here.<br /><br />Soup base - add all of it. Don't worry about it being too spicy. Per above you can always water it down later. The soup will be plenty hot. Remember it just finished boiling and it's difficult to put something in your mouth when it was just boiling.<br /><br />How to serve - there are 3 ways I'd recommend<br />1) The traditional Korean way - folks like to eat straight from the pot. There's actually an 'art' to this. After removing it from the stove, place the pot on something that wont burn. Grab the lid of the pot, a spoon (yes a spoon) and chop sticks (fork if you can't wield them).<br /><br />2) In a bowl. Don't use a plastic one unless it can stand the heat. I don't like to use plastic period for health reasons but up to you. Remove some of the excess soup from the pot first and then pour everything directly into the bowl. Grab a spoon and chopsticks/fork and place the bowl down and go to work.<br /><br />3) combination of 1 and 2 above. Place the pot of ramen and get a bowl along with a spoon and chopsticks/fork.<br /><br />How to eat:<br />First, forget what your parents have told you on slurping. To eat ramen, you must slurp. Why? Because 1) if you don't you'll burn your lips because no slurping means the noodles must pass through your lips slower and enclosed more around the noodles. 2) because your lips are more enclosed, most of the soup around the noodles are sucked away from noodles, leaving you with less flavorful noodles. So forget the decorum. Eat it asian style and slurp away.<br /><br />2nd, I'd recommend the Korean way (#1 above). You grab the pot lid then take about 2 mouthful amounts of noodle and dump it into the lid. You should be holding the lid with your left hand (switch if you're right handed) and quickly grab a large spoon and add several spoonfuls of soup broth into the lid. You're doing 3 things here 1) you're saturating the noodles with the flavorful broth. 2) by adding the noodles to the lid, you're cooling it down for consumption while keeping the rest of the noodles hot. 3) When you eat straight from the lid, you first eat the noodles and immediately follow up with a slurp from the lid itself to drink the soup base. To do this, you put the lid close to your mouth and then push the noodles in with your utensil, drink the soup right after or together as you push the noodles in. I know this sounds crude but the flavor is maximized this way. You can add any vegetables or meat to eat bite this way too.<br /><br />If you want to eat using method #2, well, it needs no explanation, just make sure you slurp and drink the broth as you eat the noodles.<br /><br />For method #3, you're basically substituting the bowl for the lid. Works as well but assuming your lid is metal, it keeps the noodles hotter. Also, people tend to put more noodles into a bowl then a lid and this ends up cooling the noodle down too much. It's also slower cuz you dont hold the bowl in your hand where as with the lid, since you're holding it, you grab noodles, place them briefly on the lid then straight to your mouth. It's cooler too ;>)<br /><br />Third, some people like to make this a heartier meal by adding rice. I usually don't add the rice to the pot until I'm half-way through because it's too hot and because the meal loses its flavor and it's too heavy. However, by adding rice directly to the pot full of ramen, you have more of a hearty meal.<br /><br />Now, enjoy!

If I am trying to keep the sodium down, I'll use about 1/2 the seasoning packet and add some Sriracha sauce.  That stuff is the JAM w/ this ramen.

So there is no doubt for the taste.<br /><br />The only problem is that it is more expensive in the U.S. But, thanks to Amazon, now we have this good deal, pack of 20 costs only $14.49? Wow, it's the best deal I've found on Amazon. Two thumbs up!<br /><br />For those who have never tried this wonderful ramen, I would recommend you to add an egg 20-30 seconds before you finish cooking and gently stir the egg. It will make the spicy taste of soup milder and richer. Yum!

Depending on your market (and I don't mean super market), the packaging and distribution network can be different.  I use to live in SoCal and now I live somewhere else.  The packaging is different here...but it's super expensive.  So I buy from Amazon.  The packaging is the same as what's sold in my local markets (both Walmart and a Korean Market...yes Walmart sells this here!).  It's taste the same.  Buy from Amazon, especially with Subscribe and Save...great deal.<br /><br />If you like spicy Ramen...this is definitely a 5 STAR product.<br />If you can't handle the capsaicin...this is probably a 1 STAR product for you.

review/summary: Good!
review/text: Just got my first order delivered yesterday, and they're really quite good! I haven't had the authentic, from-Korea ramyun (yet!) but this is much better than any ramen or other instant noodle you'll find in any typical American super market. The noodles are thicker, which means that you can cook them to the right degree (just until firm, not mushy) MUCH more easily than other brands of American noodle. It's really not that spicy, just enough to clear up your sinuses, and it's not a spicy-for-the-sake-of-it kind of spicy, it's really quite full of deep flavors. I prepare it as per the directions on the packaging except I reduce cook time by 25-30 seconds and, when they're done, I crack one or two eggs into the pot after I bring it off the burner. The residual heat in the pot is more than enough to cook the egg, you just have to remember to break up the yolk and stir the egg around the pot. It helps to thicken the soup as well, which means it tends to stick to the noodles much better.<br /><br />Overall, the noodles are quite delicious, and the best American-made noodle I've ever had. I definitely recommend them.
