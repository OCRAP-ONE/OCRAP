review/summary: Best Coconut Water EVER!
review/text: I have tried many brands and types of coconut water - this is by far the purest and BEST tasting coconut water I have had. It doesn't make my stomach hurt, unlike other brands...and it tastes perfect. It's not too sweet, but just sweet enough. It's light, refreshing and "real" tasting. You would think you were drinking straight out of a coconut. I can honestly say you will not regret trying this coconut water. I love the one with pulp! If you're not a fan of pulp, they have one without it. The pulp is actually little chunks of real coconut meat floating around in your drink...it's awesome. You have to try this drink!! Two thumbs up.

review/text: I'm wondering what are the other reviewers comparing this stuff to.<br />I wasn't expecting the same as to opening a coconut and driking it from a straw, although that's what this product advertizes. I took a sip and I wanted to spit it out immediately. Gave it another taste just to confirm it was that bad before I wrote my review and I was definitely not wrong on my first impression.<br />The taste is like what the shell of a green coconut smells when you peel it but has none of the coconut water flavor.<br />Very unsatisfying stuff.

It is OK as a cool refreshing drink, but to have it as a replacement for cocounut water is not appropriate. It is good for a low calorie refreshing drink..that is all

This may be perfectly natural but the taste is pretty flat, it is not sweet at all. It may be my personal preference, but i like it to be a bit naturally sweet.<br /><br />Also 16.2 OZ size is too big for me to finish the can in one shot.

I've never tasted coconut water this sweet straight from the coconut. I really hope I am wrong...but my gut tells me they've sweetened it to appeal to the American palate, and haven't mentioned it on the can so as to appeal to the diet conscious folk at the same time. To me, it is actually sickeningly sweet and I definitely wont be ordering again.

review/summary: Really good.
review/text: This coconut water is much better than the Brazilian sourced coconut waters such as Zico.  The Thai sourced coconut water is sweeter and and the flavor is more interesting, but there is no added sugar like you find in a lot of coconut "juices".  I really enjoy the pulp bits, gives you a little coconut to chew on, just like a fresh coconut would.  I could see how some people wouldn't like this though, so if unsure you may want to get the pulp-free water.  The prices are great on Amazon if you get a subscription, as the 9.5 ounce bottles are $2 pretty much everywhere in NYC, so for the same price you get a lot more in these cans.  Only down side is that they are so good that you go through them really fast, we can't keep them around more than 3 days before they are all gone!  At least it's better than a diet coke addiction.

review/summary: By far the best tasting CW available!
review/text: After trying every brand on the market, I can say without hesitation Taste Nirvana is the best tasting CW available. And I'm so excited it's now available via Amazon, in a can, and discounted with subscribe and save! I've been purchasing the 9.5 oz glass bottles for many months at $2 ea and found it helped me stay hydrated during the winter (heaters always dry my skin out and make me itchy). If unaware of the benefits, short version: contains electrolytes, potassium, small amounts of many essential amino acids, plus it doesn't contain any artificial colors or preservatives, it's fat-free, cholesterol-free AND low in calories! Google has a bunch of articles :)<br /><br />Info from my 9.5 oz label:<br />75 cals<br />42mg sodium<br />600mg potassium<br />16g carbs<br />2g fiber (i drink w/pulp)<br />9g sugar<br />1g protein<br />9% magnesium<br />4% calcium<br />6% vitamin c<br />4% iron<br /><br />I had been drinking pulp free and accidentally purchased bottles with pulp, but one sip and I was a fan. Can't express enough how much I enjoy NV CW. If you've been turned off by other brands of CW, want a sugar free yet sweet variety, give NV a try. You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Nirvana Coconut Water -The Best!
review/text: I grew up drinking coconut water in my hometown. I still have those vivid memories -young coconut, the jellied meat inside of it, and of course, the water itself. Wow! So delicious, and so good for your health. I am not living back home anymore, but I still crave it very often. So, I went to a health store near my home, and I purchased all kinds of different brands available at this particular store. Some were: ew!!!  others were: ok.<br />Then, about a week ago --I came across the Nirvana brand -and I am so glad I did. I subscribed and got a heck of a deal from Amazon.<br />Thank You Amazon!<br />I love the taste! I got mine with the pulp -and oh my God! Delicious!<br />Give it a try -you won't be dissapointed!<br />Enjoy! :-)

review/summary: By Far, Taste Nirvana is the Best Coconut Water Currently Available
review/text: I have tried many coconut water and juices in my lifetime. I guess you could call me a coconut juice and water fan. I have tried coconut waters in Hawaii, South America, and many Asian countries such as Thailand. The best coconut water, in my opinion, are those that are produced from coconuts harvested and grown in Thailand. The coconuts from Taste Nirvana were harvested from Nakorn Pathom province. Taste Nirvana representatives are telling the truth when they say that the large Thai coconuts that they harvest produce a sweet taste. This is absolutely the best tasting coconut water, with or without pulp. I definitely feel nourished and better after I drink this Taste Nirvana coconut water because it helps restore electrolytes (Potassium, Magnesium, Sodium, Calcium, Chloride) in my system.<br /><br />I have tried Zico, O.N.E., C2O, Vita Coco, Amy and Brian, Nature Factor, Blue Monkey, Harvest Bay, Naked coconut juices and waters, and this Taste Nirvana coconut water honestly surpasses these brands when it comes to taste, texture, and replenishment factors. This Taste Nirvana coconut water contains all natural ingredients - natural coconut water and coconut pulp. Based on percentage in daily value - you get 12% Magnesium, 6% Calcium, 8% Vitamin C, 6% Iron, 28% Potassium (1000 mg - the amount of two whole bananas), zero cholesterol, no caffeine, no preservatives, 1.7 grams of protein, and 130 calories per can.<br /><br />Taste Nirvana's slogan - Happiness Inside - is actually true. The taste of this coconut water puts a smile on my face, and Thailand is known as the "Land of Smiles". It's really amusing and fun to pour this coconut water in a clear glass to see the floating pulp. It doesn't matter if you buy Taste Nirvana coconut water with or without pulp. Taste Nirvana have done a great job with their coconut water products and all of them taste great! As soon as I drink this Taste Nirvana coconut water, I feel hydrated. And when I order these Taste Nirvana packs of 12 from Amazon, one 12 pack is usually gone in a week's time, because my whole family loves this Taste Nirvana coconut water so much! Out of all the coconut waters that my family members have tried, Taste Nirvana is the one that disappears the quickest because everybody wants to grab a can right away! I strongly recommend Taste Nirvana's real coconut water with or without pulp. You really haven't had the best tasting and most satisfying coconut water refreshment until you've tried Taste Nirvana coconut water!

review/summary: By far the BEST coconut water out there!
review/text: After a recent trip to Thailand, I got hooked on coconut water. We'd buy several coconuts a day from the street vendors and drink the water straight from the coconut. After coming home I tried about all the brands out there. None of them even compared to Taste Nirvana. This was by far the best, and closest tasting one to actual coconut water from Thai coconuts. A sweeter and nuttier flavor than the other brands. I have a hard time drinking any other brand now, after tasting this. I'm hooked!

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: I've tried several brands of coconut water now, and this is my least favorite. I guess it's a matter of personal preference, but this had kind of a weird taste to me, not as gentle as others. Also, I was looking forward to the pulp, as I love the kelapa muda (young coconut) drinks in Indonesia that have the soft pulp of young coconut in the coconut water. I was hoping to recreate that experience(without the added sugar they include in Indo), but I was disappointed. This is not young coconut pulp, which is scooped out of the coconut and is very soft and sweet, but small,hard chunks cut from a mature coconut. The hard chunks mixed in a coconut was not at all the same textural experience as kelapa muda, and I didn't like it as the contrast between pulp and water was too extreme. To each his own, of course, and some people love it.

review/text: I have tried Vita, Zico, One, Amy & Brian, and Nirvana coconut water is the closest to natural, no sugar added coconut juice. My parents have coconut trees and I'm used to coconut water straight from the coconut, with a straw! Not only is the packaging close to a real coconut, but the flavor is smooth, less processed-tasting, and very sweet without any added sugar. Coconut water is a very personal choice. People prefer one brand over the next for their own reasons, but give this one a shot. It has its own fresh taste and as close to cutting down a coconut as you're going to get.

review/summary: Wow!  Just when I thought it was impossible..... we have a 5 Star Coconut Drink!
review/text: I am Mr Coconut.  I'm the guy who brought a Battery Powered Drill down to Florida (along with a bag of straws) to open coconuts for everyone.  I drove through Southern Florida with my pickup truck and stopped at all the self-serve bins that folks set up on the roadside with coconuts that had dropped from their trees.  I loaded the best into my truck's bed and proceeded to hand out freshly drilled coconuts to folks from Naples all the way down to Islamarada.  So I know what coconut milk is supposed to taste like.  So many products out there have a strange taste or look or both but I never gave up looking.  As soon as I popped the top of the Nirvana can and took a sip, I knew I had the "real McCoy!"  It was so great that I quickly ordered another case - just to make sure that I was getting more from the same batch.  While I would have prefered if this was made-in-America, I recognize a great, pure coconut product even when it comes from Thailand.  Wow!

review/summary: Best coconut water I've tried
review/text: I've tried other brands of coconut waters and decided to try this because there was a good deal on them (though still pretty expensive) and some people said it was the best. I thought, "even if it is really the best, would I be able to tell"? The answer was YES!<br /><br />When I first tried it I wondered why it was so sweet and thought they must have added something to it, like sugar or fruit juice, but according to the ingredients, they didn't. The can says it comes from coconuts from a certain place that grow bigger & sweeter... they are certainly sweeter. Don't expect sugar water, but do expect noticeable sweetness.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I really like the taste and the pulp. I also like to drink it as cold as possible. The only downside is the relatively high price.

review/summary: Taste Nirvana - aptly named light refreshing coconut water
review/text: This is by far my favorite coconut water. I have tasted coconut water by Amy & Brian, Vita Coco, and from various restaurants. From what I have heard, and my experience corroborates this, coconut water from Thai coconuts is sweeter. Vita Coco is from Brazilian coconuts and tastes a little saltier, but still good. Taste Nirvana is made from Thai coconuts and has a nice, natural sweet taste, without any added sugars. The taste is light and refreshing (and actually is light with only 130 calories per large can).<br /><br />I love how big these cans are. They are the perfect size, although I've been known to have two in one sitting. The pulp is excellent as well. It is little 5x5x5mm squares of young coconut pulp, not the tougher meat from older coconuts. The price for this pack is also very good. I just did a quick search of coconut water on Amazon and of the top 8 or so hits, this was tied as the cheapest with another product at 12 cents an ounce if you subscribe. Also, it tastes the best. So this really is a no-brainer for me.<br /><br />Overall, this is nirvana in a can. Coconut water is delicious, and Taste Nirvana is the most delicious of the few that I've tried so far. I'd definitely recommend this product, and would recommend getting it on subscription to save a few bucks. Hope this was helpful. Leave me a comment if you have any questions. Enjoy! Now I just have to wait for my next subscription shipment...

review/summary: The creamiest of coconut waters!
review/text: I love the flavor of coconut, and one of my fondest memories is being on Copacabana Beach in Rio and drinking fresh coconut water through a straw from one of the stands on the beach. I basically enjoy every brand of no-sugar-added coconut water that I've tasted to some degree, but I've come to have two definite favorites.<br /><br />My traditional, refreshing coconut water is Amy and Brian with pulp in the 17 ounce can. I alternate that with my ultimate favorite, Taste Nirvana with pulp. Taste Nirvana is refreshing as well, but it has a creaminess that is unique among coconut waters I've tasted. Nothing is added, so my thought is that this unique texture/mouth feel must reflect the variety of coconuts they use. From the first time I tasted one of their small bottles in a health food store I've been struck by this unique quality that I've only found with Taste Nirvana. Highly recommended as a traditional, no sugar added coconut water with a creamy twist!

review/text: Having grown up drinking coconut water straight from the coconut, we are always on the lookout for something similar. I think we have found it with this product. We have tried the Vita Coco as well and the difference between coconuts sourced form different parts of the world is apparent in the taste difference between the two. The Thai-sourced coconuts have a slightly sweeter (naturally sweeter) taste to them which we personally like better. We also like the pulp (more like coconut bits) as we like to chew on them as we get them. But we can see how some people may not like that. Overall, a great, healthy alternative to the Cokes and Sprites.

review/text: This coconut water tastes fresh and sweet whereas the ones sourced from brazil tastes mineraly and lacking sweetness.  That is why they have to add flavoring to make them more attractive to drink.<br /><br />Taste Nirvana tastes like you are drinking the coconut water straight from a chilled young coconut.  The other brands tastes like it had been manufactured and processed.  Taste Nirvana truly tastes the closest to the real thing.  Every time I go out to eat vietnamese food I always order a young coconut and the Taste Nirvana is almost spot on.<br /><br />Stop wasting your money with the other brands and drink this.  I have to slow myself down from drinking too many of these in one day.  Highly recommended.

review/text: I love this coconut water -- it's naturally sweet and has nice little bits of coconut in the water (but not too much). My only "complaint" is that I bought a pack of 12 for about $22-23 on Amazon a few months ago, signing up for the regular delivery. Now, it is listed as "not available" for the regular delivery, but in fact Amazon sells the SAME product for $38 (also a 12-pack, same brand, same size per can). It's a bit unfair to lure in innocent people and then as soon as you get addicted to this fantastic coconut water (and I count myself there!) you suffer some serious sticker shock.

review/text: I've been waiting for Taste Nirvana to be on Amazon for a while!!!!!!!!! When I saw it on Amazon, I got so excited that I had to sign in to write a review about it.  I LOVE coconut water, and I've tasted many different brands of coconut water.  Until I tasted Taste Nirvana, I thought O.N.E had the best tasting coconut water.  However, Taste Nirvana's coconut water is from Thailand, and it is much sweeter naturally.  I highly recommend Taste Nirvana and I am subscribing to it!!! Thanks Amazon! :)

review/summary: Naturally Sweet, VERY GOOD
review/text: This is a superior coconut water.  It is lightly and naturally sweet and refreshing, nice ice cold with a spritz of lime juice added. The little chunks of coconut are tasty and add some healthy fiber, but can also be strained out and added to fruit salad when you prefer not to "drink" them.

review/summary: Taste Nirvana vs Other Coconut water
review/text: I was born and raise in Vietnam so I have drunk coconut juice my entire life. I guess that makes me somewhat credible because I can tell if this tastes like the real thing or not.<br />So last week I had a craving for coconut water so I decided to hit up the local supermarket and tried a few brands including Taste Nirvana, Sunvoi, Kimbo, and Laguna ***ALL MADE IN THAILAND***. Taste Nirvana was sold at Ralphs for $2.90 and the other 3 were at Asian supermarket @ $.99/ea. So why did I dish out $2.90 for this can? Because I was simply doing a taste test so I didn't bother ordering from Amazon. Let's move on with the comparison<br /><br />Taste Nirvana: 2.5/5<br />Pro:<br />-Eye catching design on the can<br />-PROBABLY healthy<br />Con:<br />-Bland, lacking in taste<br />-Expensive unless you buy from Amazon *but watch out for the horrible packaging*<br /><br />Kimbo: 3.5/5<br />Pro:<br />-Cheap (16.2 OZ for only 99 cent)<br />-Tastes pretty damn good surprisingly<br />Con:<br />-Cheap looking design just like Amy & Brian coconut<br />-Not available in Non-Asian supermarkets<br /><br />Sunvoi 1/5<br />Pro:<br />-Cheap<br />Con:<br />-Forgettable taste<br />-Not sold in US supermarket (though this is really a pro)<br /><br />Laguna: 0/5<br />Pro:<br />???<br />Con:<br />-Sugar filled water<br />-Being sold in supermarket<br />-Probly gives you disease if you drink the whole can

review/summary: not as good as pulpless
review/text: I love the pulpless one. It's very clean, crisp, mildly sweet, and no funny after-taste. The pulps are not very good. They are hard, not rockhard, but not jelly soft. It's definitely the old coconuts meat, not the young ones, and it makes this drink oddly textured. The pulps are like... undercooked rice.

review/summary: Best coconut water on the market
review/text: I have tried many brands in search of the most excellent coconut water.  Taste Nirvana Real Coconut is 100% coconut water (with pulp).  There is no added sugar, flavoring, coloring or anything!  And it is absolutely refreshing.<br /><br />When I juice in my vitamix, instead of milk I use this coconut water.  Lately I have been making an EVERYTHING smoothie with pineapple, spinach, broccoli, strawberries, grapes and mangos.  I use coconut water and this is so tasty it's worth telling the world about.<br /><br />I now get this product on auto ship and it costs even less than usual.  Try in and enjoy!

review/summary: Expensive - but there's a reason!  For the authentic coconut drinker.
review/text: First, Amazon gives you a really good deal on these cans.  The glass bottles that I've seen in stores are 9.5 ounces I think and over $2 each.  So with these being 16.2 ounces each, it's a great deal!  They are still expensive compared to other coconut waters, but there's a reason for that...it's better!<br /><br />I know someone who actually drank from coconuts where she used to live, and says that this stuff tastes better!  I guess Thailand just has some awesome coconuts.  I will say, this is for the AUTHENTIC coconut water drinker.  If you want something more sweet and fruity, try VitaCoco.  They are probably my second favorite and I like their pineapple version a lot.  This, however, is like the taste of a real coconut.  Very hydrating and refreshing!<br /><br />At first, the pulp really threw me off!  Was not expecting it.  But it's actually great once you get used to it, and really adds to the authentic coconut water drinking experience.  This is the best I've tried as far as natural, plain coconut water, and I've tried Amy & Brians, Zico, VitaCoco, and Naked.  Definitely recommend!

review/text: This coconut water is really fantastic.  It has a clean, sweet taste. It does not have the "tinny" from-a-can taste that I find with the Amy and Brian brand.  It is not watery and sour like the Vita Coco brand.  It is light, sweet and has a very pleasant coconut flavor without being overwhelming.  I like the variety with the pulp, which is a bit crunchy and adds extra coconut flavor.

review/summary: Most delicious coconut water I've tasted, but most cans dented
review/text: My husband and I love coconut water and our go-to brand has been Vita Coco; however, I received a listing of various coconut waters from Amazon based on my purchasing and browsing history and decided to try Taste Nirvana with pulp. I am glad that I did because this is truly the tastiest coconut water I've consumed thus far. There were some complaints that there are hard chunks of coconut in there, rather than silky bits. I have encountered both very silky bits of coconut and more al dente pieces. I must say that I actually appreciate this variation. I enjoy chewing the chewier bits and don't care if they come from older coconuts as some critics have said, and, of course, the silky pieces are a little bit of heaven. The coconut water itself is nice and sweet and I find it a refreshing way to start my day, often enjoying a can on my way to work. I figure this is also a good way to restore some electrolytes in the morning. Another benefit is that the huge can only costs me 2 Weight Watchers Points on the Points Plus system. Of course, consumers watching their sugar levels should note that coconut water is high in natural sugars, so it should be used in moderation only, especially because drinking large amounts can also cause unwanted gastrointestinal issues.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about the coconut water has nothing to do with the water itself, but the cans. Several of my cans were dented, and I do not believe this occurred during shipping. They were shrink wrapped nice and snug in a box and had much padding, yet the cans were dented in strange places. There are some concerns that dented cans can pose a health risk, enabling bacteria to enter the product. However, I have used even the dented cans and have not had any ill effects from this, as far as I can tell, but would obviously prefer receiving undamaged cans on subsequent orders so as not to incur such a potential risk. Because of the cans being dented, I knocked off one star.

review/summary: Taste like real Thai coconut juice
review/text: I usually buy fresh coconuts from Asian supermarkets.  They usually come from Thailand.  After trying Zico, Vita Coco and Coco Libre, I find this to be the closest to Thai coconut water.  It is sweeter than all the other brands I have tried and I double checked to make sure there is no added sugar.  The only thing that could be improved with this is the pulp.  They are chopped up into small cubes but the pulp is a little too old and tough.  Young coconut pulp is soft and tender.<br /><br />A few other reviewers complain that this brand tastes like vanilla and is not natural.  While taste is subjective, I have tasted lots of fresh coconuts with this flavor and I love it. This is now my favorite brand and I am very pleased to find a brand that is as tasty as fresh coconuts.

review/summary: Simply the Best
review/text: I have long been a fan of coconut water because it helps my state of being and wards off my migraines.  Not all coconut water tastes great to me, but I still drink it because I know it improves my health.  I love the naturally sweeter coconut taste of Taste Nirvana (this takes care of all my sweet tooth cravings) and the bonus coconut chunks in the "with pulp" bottle adds to my treat.  When I feel a migraine coming on, I cannot wait to enjoy one bottle and sometimes two, and have lessened my migraines by 90%.  I also feel more energetic since starting my daily routine of drinking this drink months ago. The nutritional  benefits are obvious from the listings on the bottle, as well as from personal experience, so much so for me that I was able to stop using all of my dangerous prescriptions daily medicines, after discovering the benefits this water gives to me.  I have a hard time believing I am alone with regard to the added benefits I've experienced and in helping to treat migraines symptoms such as mine.  Drinking extra water alone or drinking other sports drinks did nothing for me, nor did the supplements work as well.  I've tried everything and have had every test, and nothing unusual was found to explain my frequent migraines; the only effective change I made was increasing my consumption of this coconut water, after I became acutely aware of the benefits it offered me.  Whether you like this naturally sweet (no added sugar) coconut water or less sweet varieties, I'm convinced that the benefits of coconut water are still being discovered.  The nutritional information of this brand is also not in question as is with some other popular brands. The taste of coconut water may not be for everyone, but for those of us who love it, I have found my Nirvana.

review/summary: Absolute BEST coconut water by far
review/text: I started purchasing this at my local grocery store a while back, I quickly became addicted. I would buy whatever they had on the shelf, clearing them out of stock every couple weeks. I then sent my husband to make a quick trip to the store specifically to buy me some coconut water, sadly.. he bought the LAST can. I was devastated. That was over a month ago, and I've tried every other brand at the market since. YUCK. All of them, flat, flavorless, dirty tasting, borderline salty, pulp-free, sugar added... you name it. The Taste Nirvana coconut water is bar far the best taste and quality. Even my 4 year old son loved it. I bought another brand last week that I hadn't tried, I had high hopes because it was from an asian grocer and the label wasn't in English. My son was excited for "coconut water" but spit this out quickly. I've given up in finding another brand that's comparable to Taste Nirvana - it doesn't exist. Thank goodness I just found it on Amazon.. Added to cart :D

If bits of coconut floating around in your water is a deal breaker, then consider this brand's without pulp variety. You won't be disappointed. I've used it for drinking to rehydrate (also, to prevent hangovers), for cooking Thai dishes or as a base instead of chicken broth, for baking in place of milk, etc. The flavor is great, the calories are reasonable, and it's actually healthy.

review/text: Love this product!  Found out about how great coconut water in a can was a few years back, but most of the regular grocery stores and convenience stores that are stocking it now only have products with added sugar - yuck!  They are just way too sweet.  Nirvana has no added sugar, or anything else, for that matter.  Just pure refreshment.  I kind of like the added bits of coconut meat.  I wouldn't call it pulp, in the sense we usually think about it, more like little irregular bits about 1/8 to 1/4 inch sized.<br /><br />I'm getting this by subscription, 12-pack every month.  it is usually gone within a week or two!  Maybe I need to order two a month.  On second thought, the Sprouts grocery near our house has been offering great sales on the C2O coconut water regularly, which is as good as the Nirvana, selling 2 for $3, or even 2 for $2.  At that price, it is a better deal than Amazon's subscription rate.  If Sprouts keeps that up, we may just have to cancel our subscription, but it wont be because of the product, just the price.

review/summary: ok, but flat flavor profile
review/text: Besides this I've had Nature Factor organic, Amy & Brian, Blue Monkey, and Naked coconut waters and actual coconut water from the coconuts growing in my front yard (years ago).  Based on flavor alone this one tasted like it was processed too long, a one-note sweetness and not much else.  For me what was missing is the fresh, enzyme-y, multi-note flavors Amy & Brian or other brands capture that is similar to raw coconut water. On the plus side:  no tin can off-flavors like I've experienced with Blue Monkey or an occasional can of Amy & Brian's and the price is tolerable.  Amazon delivered in excellent condition on time. Taste Nirvana coconut water  - just not the right taste for me.

review/summary: By far my favorite coconut water right now
review/text: Previously, Amy and Brian's with pulp was my favorite coconut water until I found this one. If you have tried other brands of coconut water and really didn't get the craze, it's worth giving this product a try. I can hardly keep the stuff around. I receive a case a month but am finding I just drink it way faster and have to order additional cases.<br /><br />Things to keep in mind:<br /><br />-This coconut water has no added sugar, but has more naturally occurring sugar than some other brands (different coconut varieties from around the world produce coconuts that vary in nutritional facts)<br />-This particular product has pulp (pieces of coconut) inside. If you don't want the pulp, Taste Nirvana has a coconut water that doesn't have pulp<br />-Although this is a healthy way to rehydrate, it is much more expensive than water and can become addicting.

review/text: I recently started drinking coconut water and was surprised to find how many different brands and varieties there are, so I decided to try them all. This is the best tasting and most refreshing one, in my opinion. The only downside to the can is that the pulp tends to settle to the bottom; at least when you buy this in the glass bottle you can shake it up in between sips.

review/text: This coconut water is my favorite coconut water of all the coconut waters I have tried. It's sweeter and doesn't have that dry taste that brands such as Zico and Naked have. I believe it's because the coconuts are harvested from Thailand rather than Brazil, making this coconut water sweeter and better tasting. The coconut pulp bits are also a plus and taste really good. I highly recommend this brand!

review/text: I did not know what to expect as I never tasted this before.  I read all the great reviews and trusted the consumer reviews.  Guess what?  It is exactly what the reviews claim it to be.  The product quality is highly tasteful and nutritious.  My favorite part is the pulp- if you like pulp. I love pulp so it was very tasty.  I introduced this particular product to my family and they also loved it.  They made very positive comments about the nutritional content as well.  The amount of potassium is amazing, worth 2.5 bananas and sugar content is looooowwr than other very tasty cocunut waters.  You have to get this if you like coconut water, like the texture of pulp, and want something different to add to your intake of liquids that is good for you.  I thank all the consumer reviews as that was the primary reason I made the subscription order without having never tried it ....thanks amazon community.

It's great that they have bits of soft and hard coconut bits floating around.  They sure make the experience of drinking the coconut water a lot more fun.

review/summary: Different from glass bottle version
review/text: We love this brand of coconut water, but our local grocery store only has the small glass 9 ounce bottles for $2 each, so we looked online for a cheaper alternative and found this canned version of the same brand. It tastes the same as the glass bottles, however the pulp is much differet. The pulp in the bottled version is very fine and drinkable, but the pulp in the can is large undrinkable chunks of actual hard coconut. So large it needs to be filtered out since there was a couple chunks in there large enough to choke on.<br /><br />So I would recommend buying the canned kind WITHOUT pulp, since it's not actually pulp so much as very large chunks of hard coconut. I'm kind of wondering if I got a bad batch or something?

review/text: I just wanted to share my experience with HappyBaby food.  I tried several different brands of baby food for my children and several different brands of organic baby food.  HappyBaby has always ranked #1 in my book and my childrens'.  Their products are always very fresh tasting and they constantly come up with flavors that I would never think to feed my baby.  HappyBaby Mango was both fresh tasting and something I would never think of giving my baby, but so glad I did.  I love mangoes and regularly use them in my meals.  Mangoes are packed with fiber, antioxidants and vitamins. With this being organic none of the nutrients and vitamins were lost in the processing and packaging. Speaking of the packaging, I love it. The packaging made it so easy to feed the kids (or them feed themselves) and then twist the top back on and use for another time.  I will definitely be buying this product again.

review/summary: Pretty good; excellent bubbles!
review/text: I'm a Double Bubble gum gal, but received Hubba Bubba as a gift recently from a friend. Hubba Bubba is a very soft, non-sticky bubble gum that creates the most amazing bubbles I've ever been able to handle (and some too large to control). It is quite sweet and the flavor lasts a long time.<br /><br />Unlike my usual Double Bubble brand, each individual piece of Hubba Bubba is quite large, so I use only half a piece at a time (otherwise I find myself drooling down my chin). It remains soft as long as one chews it so if you're also a gum 'snapper' as I am especially as the gum starts to lose its flexibility after being chewed a bit, this product doesn't snap.<br /><br />So I now have products on hand from which to choose when I'm in the confines of my home so I can blow bubbles as large as beach balls, or snap  my stress away until my heart is content.<br /><br />If you like bubbles, and I mean BIG bubbles and the fun one has creating them, this is for you.

review/summary: Love the flavor!
review/text: This gum reminds me of the original Dubble Bubble strawberry gum (small rectangular shaped gum, which got discontinued in the Dominican Republic where I was first introduced to it). Hubba Bubba's Outrageous Original is as close to the flavor as it can get. I love it and I always purchase it. The pieces of gum are thick, so sometimes I eat half and leave half in the wrapper.

review/summary: The only food I will feed my dogs!
review/text: I have two senior dogs that were on a raw natural food diet for many years.  I had been hard pressed to find something that would fulfill my pets nutritional requirements while being comprised of healthy ingredients.  This is it!  Even my vet, a fierce advocate for raw food, approves of this.  My dogs love it, I no longer have to mix my own ingredients together, and I have peace of mind knowing my beloved pets are being fed high-quality food.  They devour every last particle!

review/summary: my dogs love this!
review/text: This is one food that when mixed with their dry food, my dogs will eat every last drop. They love this. Our older dog (just turned 2) needs to be on a grain free diet, so that is what our puppy gets too. I love that this is 95% Turkey and that the dogs really like it.

review/summary: My Yorkie Likes It, So I Like It
review/text: My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine.

review/summary: Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound
review/text: I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.

review/summary: Feed my two dogs only Wellness brand. Consistently on top ten canned dog food lists
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and otehr healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: This is the ONLY food my dog will eat
review/text: I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.

review/summary: Wellness is excellent!
review/text: My pups LOVE this food!  WELLNESS products have consistently proven to be top of the line food for dogs and cats and their Chicken Stew is no exception!<br />This is so well made and although the sauce is kinda slimy, it is a healthy slimy and one that nourishes my dearest of creatures!  Please note that this food is not meant as a dish all unto itself, but rather, it is a food topper to go with dry food nuggets.  Together the nutrition abounds!

review/summary: Great for hiding medication.
review/text: My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.

review/summary: Wellness Canned Dog Food for Adult Dogs, 95-Percent Lamb, 12-Pack of 13.2-Ounce Cans
review/text: I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.

review/summary: Wellness Chicken Stew
review/text: The ratings for this food are among the highest and my Labrador LOVES this stuff!  I feel very good giving him this high quality food and am glad that my picky eater wants something that is so good for him.  It's chunky and you can see peas, carrots, potato, and, of course, the chunks of meat.  I highly recommend this product!
