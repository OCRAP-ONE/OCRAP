review/summary: Bad on Amazon.
review/text: Managers special, Amazon Prime.  a Month later the sale was canceled.  Two days before it was canceled I inquiried about the item.  Customer service said we can cancel this order and order from someone else to increase speed.  True at $10 more.  I said no, I will wait for what I ordered.  Then Amazon canceled my sale saying they couldn't get the item, but yet it is still available on Amazon.  I guess it was just too good of a price.

review/summary: Amazon is a disappointment.
review/text: Just like the reviewer above me I placed an order for these 3 weeks ago only to be sent a cancellation email telling me that amazon could not get them in stock even though they had them in stock last night. I have been disregarded by CS reps on multiple occasions and told that amazon would not have them back in stock (even though they had them minutes before for a much higher price). It would seem that instead of standing behind their sales, they find it easier to cancel the orders of their customers and tell them to re-order for a much higher price after already waiting 3 weeks for the product that was purchased. Seriously disappointed in amazon, this is the third purchase in a row that has been cancelled due to them not wanting to/not able to fulfill the orders.

review/text: This is the second time in the last 2 months amazon has cancelled my order.  First the hp touchpad, which i wasted money buying a case for it only to have my order cancelled with no warning, now my 6 bags of skittles were cancelled with no warning.  Amazon says i can order them again, for $28.00.  Sounds like a good deal, i ordered them originally for $6.00

review/summary: Bait and switch from Amazon
review/text: I am a little ticked at an email from Amazon stating that this is not available so they were canceling my order, followed by constantly keeping these bags of Skittles in my recommended items.  I bought some to send to my nieces and nephews, had joked with my brother and sister about how they were going to deal with so much candy.  I'll bring presents next time to make up for the failure of this to appear. I'll remain a huge purchaser from Amazon in the tens of thousands per year between me and my wife, but things like this are annoying enough for me to waste my time writing this post. . .

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.
review/text: Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them.

review/summary: Gevalia has the smoothest tasting coffees around
review/text: I have been a subscriber to Gevalia Coffee and tea products for over 10 years.  I started subscribing because of their flavored coffees.  All of Gevalia coffees come in airtight shrink wrapped foil which protects their flavor.<br /><br />Vanilla Nut has a wonderful nutty flavor that the vanilla helps to smooth out.  Once you try Gevalia coffees it will be hard to go back to drinking other coffees.  I tried to save money by purchasing other flavored coffees in my grocery store and the grocery store coffee always tasted stale.  Once I went back to drinking the Gevalia coffee, one sip made me realize that I would never be able to give it up completely.  Their coffee has such a rich and smooth texture that I have never gotten with other coffees.

review/summary: Not worth the money
review/text: I've never tried Gevalia Coffee and I won't ever purchase it again.  Back in the mid-80s the Superfresh stores sold a premium vanilla almond coffee that was out of this world!  It was whole bean coffee and included almond slices in with the beans. The brewing aroma filled the room and the flavor was wonderful. The company went out of business and I've been trying to find that coffee ever since.  This was my latest attempt. Gevalia might claim this coffee is vanilla almond but they could call it any other name -- it has no extra flavor.  You can't smell vanilla almond when you open the bag, you can't smell it while it's brewing and you certainly can't taste it.  It tastes like stale coffee. That's it. This is a very fine grind, almost powdery. If you have a machine that clogs with with finely ground coffee, look elsewhere. And if you want the aroma and flavor of vanilla almond, keep looking.  It isn't here.

review/text: I own a small cafe in Avalon, a tourism-based town on Catalina Island.  Our focus is on affordable, healthy, natural foods with great flavor - an alternative to the calorie-laden, greasy hamburger,french fries and  pizza fare that is offered everywhere.  Snikiddy's fit the bill perfectly.  I now have devoted parents who come in just to purchase these snacks - not sure if it's for themselves or their kids!  I am now purchasing all of my snacks through Amazon and using the Subscribe & Save program whenever possible.  Not only are the prices much lower than my regular food suppliers, I get longer expiration dates, which means fresher food.

review/text: We (three Sicilians) ate the bottarga straight from the package last night. It is delicious. If you don't know what bottarga is, it is made from tuna eggs, salted and dried. It can be used to make a delicious pasta: saute garlic, parsley and hot pepper in olive oil, have some grated bottarga ready, add to oil mixture and toss pasta (linguini or spaghetti are fine) in olive oil mixture and serve with some grated bottarga as garnish. Couldn't be simpler. Remove the skin from the bottarga before using. This bottarga came from Sardenia but it tastes exactly like the bottarga from Sicily.

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

review/text: I am so happy to be able to buy Organic Valley, as Horizon seems to have some  issues. The packaging is nice and kid friendly. The serving size is just right. They have a pretty good shelf life (around 4 months is what I have been seeing) and the pack of 12 don't take up a ton of shelf space. My kids love all of the flavors. Vanilla does mean vanilla, so probably not the most tasty on top of cereal, but for a quick snack I even sneak a cartoon from the kids!<br />Love the product, packaging, price, and the fact it is delivered to my door! Organic Valley can be hard to find in stores (at least in my area) so being able to get it from Amazon on a regular delivery schedule is ideal. We drink all 4 flavors and they are all a hit in our house.

But most people have their home temps set at 80 or below. My boys (twins- age 4) love their milk and flavored milk is a special treat. They get so excited when they get to have one of these. I am happy because it's organic, lowfat and low in sugar compared to "regular chocolate milk". I think it tastes pretty good too! I also always keep some in our pantry for those days when our milk in the fridge is running low. Then there is no emergency grocery store trip late at night because I need milk in the morning. I plan to continue buying this milk!

review/summary: This stuff really works!
review/text: I was always disappointed with how quickly whipped cream seemed to "fall apart". This product solves that problem perfectly, and doesn't change the flavor or appearance of the cream. However, I find that using one packet per pint of cream is more than sufficient to give me long-lasting whipped cream. The mfr recommends two packets.

review/text: I have used this product for years. As a German immigrant, this has been available for my use even before I found it here in the USA. It is sort of like using cream of tarter in your meringue. Don't use too much and don't overwhip. It will not dry out and your peaks will stay pretty. The flavor is not affected adversely either. I highly recommend that you try this product. From an experienced international cook!

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: In the great trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks the most malty, Milo is medium chocolately and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolately.<br /><br />All 3 are basically comfort drinks when plain milk just won't do. All 3 are powders to which you add milk and sugar to get a sweet malty drink, the latter two with chocolate flavor as well.<br /><br />I love all 3 drinks. But if you are drinking this for nostalgia's sake, make sure you get the Milo from where ever your nostalgia springs from because Milo is made in different countries and they all taste a little different. For me, I love Milo for it's good mix of chocolate and malt, not too much of either, and a great comfort drink for cold nights.

review/summary: Taste and texture differs...
review/text: This Milo is grainy, pebble-y and less sweet. Must have been made for a different demographic? Not the same as the one I grew up with - the Milo sold in Asia is powdery, sweeter and has a richer, more chocolatey taste. Unfortunately, I just can't get past the significant difference in taste... Buyers should definitely take note (in case this is important!).<br />Edited on Nov 2011: Ok, so maybe my initial review was a bit harsh. After some time, I've come to like this one too. It's not the Milo I grew up with but it is a nice change.

review/text: I first learned about Milo in Canada from some Australians, and just loved it with coffee.  Two weeks of the combo up there on a guided camping trip and I was hooked enough to buy some online here in the States when I returned.  I have not tried it as a hot or cold chocolate drink, but using one mounded tablespoon in a latte cup of coffee is delicious.  Perhaps it is like a mocha (have never tried one), but so easy and SOOOOO GOOD.  I believe a 14.1 ounce container will last two months for 1 person using it as I did and once a day.  In addition to the flavor, I like the fact Milo also contains a combination of B vitamins and magnesium, which according to the label helps release energy from proteins, fats and carbohydrates in food. I never drink my coffee at home without it!

Anyway, so they were crushed so bad that the cans were breached. And there's no way I'm about to do a taste test on it to figure out what happened.<br />So Amazon doesn't do returns on food products, but as the item must have been damaged, before it was shipped (due to the box it came in being un-satupon) and not during. They kindly replaced it without any hassles. My replacement was just fine and the squirrels decided they weren't as fussy as me and loved the milo I left for them.

review/summary: It's the Colombian version
review/text: Milo is made in many different places around the world and apparently modified for local tastes. It's particularly popular in Malaysia (which is where I discovered it). In addition to that, I'd only had the Singapore version before, which is sweeter, less grainy, and dissolves a bit more easily in cold milk relative to this version, which is made in Colombia. But it's still a good product regardless.

review/text: Milo is very popular, delicious malt chocolate drink, in a lot of countries. It can be drink hot or cold and it can be made with water or milk, or a mixture of both. It is semi sweet, so people that like the sweetness of hot chocolate can just add a teaspoon or two sugar to it. It tastes something similar to hot chocolate when hot, and milkshake when cold. Not only does it taste really good, it is nutritious as well! It is high in iron, calcium and vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12.<br />It is just a shame that we have to import it...

review/text: For reference, this version of Milo (As noted by abother reviewer, Milo is slightly different based on where and for which market it is made for) is made in Colombia. I grew up drinking the Southeast Asia version of Milo, which is much more of a fine powder. The South American version is more granulated, and less rich--I have to add an extra teaspoon to get the same level of chocolatey-ness as its Southeast Asian counterpart. But the taste is still great--beats hot chocolate hands-down!!

Unfortunately, this time they were lacking the "sea salt" they advertise, and were not as tasty as the previous bags I purchased. I still like them, as long as I eat them with a dip of some type...hummus, bean dip, etc., vs. just alone. I did purchase them again, thinking they might be better, but so far, again they are pretty bland. They're a healthy snack, but I probably won't order them again.

review/summary: Disappointing on every level
review/text: Purchased the cucumber dill lentil chips with high hopes, especially after reading the reviews.  I wanted a snack chip made from something other than white flour or potatoes, and lentils are healthy, & cucumber dill sounded like a great combination.  However, they were disappointing on all levels.  First, the flavoring is sparse, some of the chips have a coating of the seasoning, some have a small amount of seasoning and many don't have any seasoning at all.  They are very bland w/o the seasoning.  Second, the ingredients!  Lentils?  Yes, but...here's the ingredient list in order, bean flour (lentil, garbanzo & adzuki beans) that's good, but the next ingredients are POTATO and/or pea starch & POTATO fiber, then oil and seasonings.  These are lentil chips, NOT potato chips.  Why is it all these "healthy" other grain, multi-grain snacks always have potatoes in them?  Serving size is 22 chips, 110 calories, 3 grams fat, 19 carbs & 3 fiber.  But the flavor is so disappointing, can' even tell they're cucumber dill for the most part, and the price is a little high for styrofoam chips.

review/summary: Just not as good as from the store
review/text: I first purchased these chips at my local convenience store, and I was blown away by the taste.  I have never been a fan of potato chips in the first place, and after I went gluten-free I was looking for a suitable substitute in my snacking diet for pita chips.  The moment I tasted these (and shared them with a friend who CAN tolerate gluten), we both swore then and there that we would eat these instead of whatever other junk food is available to us.  A month later, we found ourselves going through two or three of them a week, so the next logical step for us was to buy in bulk.<br /><br />What a disappointment that was.  At a little less than $36, the box of 12 is no cheaper than buying 12 bags individually from the company's website.  And in the bulk box, the product has an undesirable tendency to settle--the dusting of salt just sits on the bottom of the bag, encouraging me to eat it out of the bag upside down.  And for some reason there seems to be slightly less salt in the bulk package than there was in the individually purchased ones.<br /><br />The final straw that has discouraged me completely from buying the chips in bulk is that out of the 12 bags I received, all of them had a few overcooked chips, and at least 7 of them had one or two completely blackened, burnt chips.  Fortunately, despite their uncanny resemblance to blue corn chips, they were just overdone and still gluten-free.  Don't get me wrong--despite the overcooked chips and the low salt content, the chips were still good, on their own or with a dip, but they weren't fantastic like those in the individual packages.<br /><br />The general feeling I get from this package of 12 is just that the company is trying to get rid of its excess stock of chips that did not quite pass the more exacting standards of the individual packages.  And since it isn't even more expensive to buy those, I would highly recommend you steer clear of the bulk pack on this one.

review/text: I had a friend give me a bag of these chips. My family finished the bag in under an hour and were clamoring for more.  I was so happy to find them on Amazon.  So far we have only tried the Sea Salt, but I look forward to trying the other flavors.

review/summary: I love these chips!
review/text: I bought these a few months ago in a grocery store out of state.  Disappointed I could not find them near where I lived, I was delighted to find them on Amazon.  Now, I order them a dozen bags at a time and have to ration myself so I don't eat them all in a few days.  They're delicious, very crispy (which I love) and healthier than other snacks I used to eat (e.g., potato chips).  I love them with salsa or hummus.  That they're gluten free is an added benefit.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WQPGYE">Mediterranean Snacks Sea Salt Baked Lentil Chips 4.5-ounce (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Unpleasant flavor and texture - Cucumber Dill
review/text: I grabbed these because they were on a stand close to the cash register, they were gluten free, and I was hungry. I adore lentils and I love cucumber and dill. They sounded perfect.<br /><br />In my hurry I forgot to check the ingredients. As soon as I opened the bag I realized my mistake. An overpowering odor of sour cream, a flavor I find repugnant, greeted my nose. I tried one just to be fair, but all I could taste was sour cream with a hint of dill. The texture was unpleasant too--foamy--kind of like one of those biodegradable foam peanuts had been flattened out and crisped up.<br /><br />The offending ingredient, as far as I can tell, is buttermilk. I understand why chip makers put this buttermilky/sour creamy flavor in their ranch and sour cream & onion chips. I don't understand why it's in so many others, nacho cheese, cheddar cheese, cucumber dill. About the only safe flavor anymore is salt & vinegar.<br /><br />I wish I could get my money back because there is no way I'm going to eat these and I'm pretty sure my family won't like them either. Too bad I didn't happen upon the sea salt flavor that everyone seems to like, because these were pretty terrible.

review/summary: Great made in USA rawhide
review/text: It is hard to find rawhide that is sourced from AND made in the USA. I used to just buy any old rawhide because I didn't know better, but then my dog started getting sick from them so I did a little research. I realized that there is little to no quality control in some of the other countries where rawhide is most typically made. So, I decided to only buy USA stuff from now on. It is surprisingly hard to find. I finally discovered that they sell this brand at my local Wegmans and I do still buy the long rolls there from this brand, but since I don't shop regularly at that store, it's just easier and cheaper for me to order these particular bones from Amazon on subscribe and save. Especially since the dogs get them almost every day.<br /><br />They are smaller than I thought they would be but they last about 45 minutes with my two large dogs. One is a puppy who is a powerful chewer (doodle) and the other a german shepherd, for reference. The packaging is a major PITA; each is individually wrapped and it takes scissors and determination to get them open. Especially annoying when your dogs are sitting there drooling on your lap waiting for you to open them.<br /><br />With the subscribe and save, these are the same price each (even cheaper than some) as the made in China rawhides sold at all those fancy pet stores and the grocery store. They are totally worth the price! This is a really good deal and you can't go wrong, even if you have bigger dogs.

review/summary: Made in the USA rawhide
review/text: This rawhide is made and assembled in the USA.  My dog loved the smell and tore into it right away.  She is a mutt, about 30lbs, and she managed to completely eat this rawhide in about 2hrs; of course she stuck to it relentlessly for those two hours.<br /><br />Each bone is individually wrapped, so you will need scissors and some patience to unwrap each one.  The rawhide itself left a brown residue on the carpet, but it is nothing some carpet stain remover spray cannot handle.<br /><br />I am extremely happy to have found this product.  It is exactly what our dog needs for a stimulating treat.  The individual wrapping and carpet markings are worth noting, but these inconveniences will not keep me from reordering.

review/text: I have a couple dogs that love these rawhide bones. They tend to rob each others of their treat. The bones may be small but if the dogs chew on them, (which they will) they are worthwhile. My smaller dog about the size of a Pomeranian just guards his with his life. My other which is still a pup retriever just loves sneaking around for any lying around and will snatch them when found. Be prepared for a dog satisfied with its treat.

review/summary: The Biggest of the 8 Rawhides is BARELY 4" - REALLY SMALL FOR PRICE
review/text: Would give 3 stars for how really small these are, but the shipping was so fast, I upped it a star.  The decrease of Subscribe & Save discount from 15% to only 5% really hurts the ability to get any good value on multi packs of dog raw hides.<br /><br />These are so small (compared to the many different orders and brands I've purchased from Amazon, it is the same cost as my corner pet store.  Did love the Amazon Subscribe & Save with a great sale price given my small fixed income.<br /><br />Will probably be cutting back on almost all now.  Drats!  But still love Amazon in general.

review/summary: Favorite of our pup!
review/text: We have a 50 lb Black lab/beagle mix and she absolutely LOOOVES these rawhides.  We are very cautious about rawhide not made in the US and were so pleased to find these bones from a trusted brand.  She has a finicky stomach and also eats the Castor & Pollux Organix dog food which is also great.  My only hesitancy with these bones is that they are tinier than expected and she can devour 1 in under 10/15 minutes.  I highly recommend this product, but if your dog is a chewer like ours, I would suggest going up to the next larger size.... which is why I'm on amazon now! :)

review/summary: Very Good Popcorn
review/text: We have tried several brands of popcorn in out upright popper. Frankly we cannot find a great difference thus we look for price. While our unit takes a 6 oz bag we find we can use either the four ounce or 8 ounce bags just as well. The lid always lets the excess popped corn fall out of the popper when we use the larger eight ounce bag. In this case we had the 6 ounce. The corn popped well with only a few unpopped grains remaining. The butter  seasoning held well in the package. This is a pet peeve as we have found some brands where the seasoning and oil remains liquid thus making it difficult for us to empty the bag into the popper. Shipment for excellent.

Basically, they're a fine light and delicate wafer (about 1 1/2 inches wide) that has been rolled tightly and then one end of the roll has been dipped in a tasty milk chocolate. Mmmmm. It's a nice combination. These wafer roll would make a fine item to go with tea or coffee, or you can just eat them as they are for a bit of dessert. Quite excellent.

review/text: I love this company! Their products are always fresh and delicious. The hemp seeds are wonderful and versatile, and I make all kinds of recipes with them. I like buying the big bucket of their hemp seeds because I use them in shakes, smoothies, eaten plain, added to trail mix, sprinkled on salad, and I even make many Raw vegan desserts, soups, and pates with them. I keep them stored in the freezer for extra freshness. This super food's nutrient profile is awesome... highly digestible complete protein, essential fatty acids in a great ratio, iron, calcium, vitamin E, zinc, chlorophyll, and other nutrients.<br /><br />Just the other day I created a Raw Vegan Frozen Banana Protein Shake by blending 1 cup water, 3 sm-med frozen bananas (chopped), 1 Tablespoon raw carob (optional), 2 Tablespoons Manitoba Harvest Hemp Seeds, and 4 Tablespoons Manitoba Harvest Protein Powder. It was so yummy that I made a second one in the same day and I'm getting ready to make another right now.

review/summary: good deal for the money but too many seed husks
review/text: This is the 3rd time I have ordered from this company through Amazon and have never had a problem.  The container clearly states that it contains "shelled hemp seed" which I would interpret as "hemp hearts" without the outer shell or husk. But apparently it doesn't say that the husks are removed from the container.  This most recent order had at least 50% husks mixed in with the hearts so I took issue.  Amazon as well as Manitoba Harvest were very accommodating and sent a replacement order.  I was not charged for the first order.  The replacement was better but still had lots of husks.  I've purchased other hemp hearts in the health food store and there are no husks at all so this was a bit disappointing.  If you don't mind the taste or texture of having them in there, then it's a great deal.

review/summary: Excellent Product - Cannabis -  Staple Health Food
review/text: This is a fantastic product, I just ordered my second tub.  The seeds smell very fresh and keep well.  The protein is primarily edestin, which is a native protein to the human being and is the ideal protein for anti-body and immunoglobulin production.  There are also no enzyme inhibitors on shelled cannabis which makes it very easily digestible.  Also,  the fat content is literally a perfect source of essential fats, with the same ratio of fats as are found in our brain!  Of course they are short chain omega 3 fatty acids, as with all vegetarian fair, however the human body produces the enzyme delta-9 desaturase which transform them into long chain fatty acids, like those found in fish.  It is this process of the human being developing the long chain fats that Rudolf Steiner hints at as being one of the real spiritual reasons to consume vegetarian foods, is that our body becomes a factory for certain fats, which has a certain alchemical effect within the individual.<br /><br />I thought it would take me awhile to go through these but I finished the tub within 2 weeks.  Excellent to sprinkle on salads, steamed veggies, base in smoothies, additive to yogurts and oatmeals, mixed with potatoes, pretty much mix it with anything.<br /><br />I was showing the tub off to one of my friends who eats more of a mainstream diet and I put it up to her nose to smell it and she said it smelled like dirt - it really sort of does, it smells great.  It is very earthy and almost bitter in taste, however it is very mild when mixed with other things.  The seeds have a robust character of tremendous value to the human species, anyone committed to the development and future of humanity would be wise to befriend and defend this plant of nearly unequivocal value to the human species.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be hemp farms in America soon - If we had eyes to see this food would be a staple in all hosptials, schools, and other major food institutions.  The plant is easy to grow and extremely useful in a multitude of ways.  Word to the wise: Keep your eye on hemp.

review/summary: Best quality hemp Seed on the planet
review/text: Hey! If you have never tried adding Hemp seed to your diet you should. I started out with a smaller version of Manitoba Harvest Hemp Seed, but used it all in smoothies, salads, and various recipes quickly, so I upgraded to the 5 lb. bucket. It stores nicely in my outside frig. You can also store Hemp seeds in glass mason jars and freeze them. When you are ready for use, just open the jar and measure out the quantity you need.<br /><br />The taste of Manitoba's Hemp Seed is superior in my opinion. In fact, I have grown to love the taste of hemp. I always sprinkle a few tablespoons on my kale salads or in smoothies.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this product especially if you are looking for more vegan ways to up your protein intake, as Hemp is an excellent source.

All three are high-calorie foods but in moderation appear to have very significant health benefits.<br /><br />These seeds are high in protein and I highly recommend that you research their benefits.

review/summary: Hemp Super Food...
review/text: I consume these straight from the container with spoon, an hour before my work outs without mixing in a bowl or as dressing. I consume it first thing in the morning or when I need a quick burst of energy regardless of the time of the day. For years I have consumed 1)raw sunflower seeds, 2)almonds in water 3)organic sesame+flax seeds grinded in coffee maker + cocoa powder + unflavoured protein isolate on daily basis and now I have added hemp to my diet. Seeds all go rancid due to the oil and the germ inside the seed so regardless of the type or brand, seeds need to be stored in freezer, in a dark, cold, sealed container, away from any moisture. If plastic container it needs to be #5 or much safer in glass containers. I consume seeds within two weeks but the hemp seeds within the most three months since I can not get it in small quantities and it will lose its nutritional value. Organic is better but these are good as well and priced very reasonably. This is an unbelievable product and you can not grow it in US since it is illegal and big business does not want to see you healthy and there is no profit in hemp for since it is so cheap to grow with so many benefits that scares big pharma, plastic industry, fabric-cotton industry, pesticide producers, etc... so if you live in US, Canada becomes your only hope. Hemp increases my level of energy without an other artificial stimulants like caffeine and sugar. More energy with less empty calorie fillers, like sugar and saturated fat, and common energy bars. Contains the highest percentage of globulin than any other plant which is an essential amino acid that helps my body to create antibodies, a component of a healthy immune system. Healthy addition to a weight loss plan since it provides essential nutrients such as protein, essential fatty acids, fibre, vitamins and minerals without adding an excess amount of calories, starch and sugar. One of the best natural boosters that I can get when doing all different type of sports or when I need energy without a big meal. Hemp is truly a good plant for the environment and it is shame that we have to deal with the politics of the hemp instead of the benefits of the hemp in US. Victim of its own success. This is a super food next to quinoa, kale, broccoli, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc... Thank you Canada.

Hemp Seeds are a perfect food, combined with some goji berries and plenty of fresh greens, Hemp is all you need for complete nutrition and a perfect diet.<br /><br />It's really a shame that US growers cannot legally grow this amazing crop that contains 0 psychoactive compounds. Farmers grew Hemp in World War II to clothe the troops for battle, and this fast growing crop helped win the war in it's own way.

review/summary: Will NEVER be without my Hemp Hearts!!
review/text: I am a sceptic so I always start anything as a doubter. The day after we started on Hemp hearts back Dec 1st 2010 , both hubby and I noticed we both had more energy and the brain fog lifted. We eat 4 tablespoons each n the mornings in yogurt or in smoothies. I sprinkle them on salads and add to most of my food.<br /><br />  Ok, our so I thought "Heck if we feel better how bout giving them to our dogs!" Our pug is 11 this summer. He was getting lethargic , lazy, and seemed like he was just kind of depressed. I thought it was just aging and do not want to loose him and see him like this. I add 1 teasp to each dogs food every day and their coats are shinier and have stopped shedding. The pugs eyes seem brighter and they both have more energy so the pug has lost some weight. I hope never to be without my Hemp hearts again as long as I live! I am on auto deliver and we eat 5 lbs a month.<br /><br /> Hemp hearts are God's perfect food! You could live on them and water alone if you had to! Stock up!<br /><br /> God bless us all! Eat more Hemp Hearts!<br />BeeTx

review/text: My wife and I are both enjoying this product.  I had a heart attack and have to watch my diet closely to control my weight and especially my cholesterol levels.  A typical breakfast is a nice bowl of oatmeal, and adding the hemp seeds gives me some excellent protein.

review/text: We like it the price is great but there are alot of shells and the closer you get to the bottom the more there are. For the price we decided we could pick them out. What a pain. But price makes it worth it.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I really like these. They are so fresh and tasty. Even though I gave them 5 stars there is just one thing that was annoying...the occasional shell or at least I think it was a shell. Very crunchy. It won't stop me from purchasing again. Great product.
