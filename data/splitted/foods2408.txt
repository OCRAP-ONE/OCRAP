review/summary: not much, if any, chocolate flavor
review/text: After trying -- and liking -- the regular PB2 product, I decided to try this variety with "premium chocolate" added.  Quite honestly, I have a hard time tasting the difference between this variety and the PB2 product without chocolate.  Maybe I could discern the difference during a side by side comparison, but by itself this product doesn't really taste like chocolate at all.  It just tastes like sweet peanut butter.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving it three stars is that it still tastes okay and I like this product generally -- a good way to get some peanut flavor without all the calories.  But if you're looking for a chocolate/peanut product to replace your Reese's Peanut Butter Cup habit, this product isn't it.

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: This is the chocolate version of the normal PB2. While this product, like the original PB2, is mostly devoid of the healthy fats found in natural peanut butter, this product is a GREAT way to get that peanut butter flavor into baked goods, drinks, and so on without the added calories and fat!

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I stumbled across the availability of this food article while recently perusing Amazon's staggeringly-enormous and virtually-endless catalog. It's incredible how much stuff is at your electronic fingertips on this website -- including this old-fashioned candy bar, which brings back memories from childhood.<br /><br />Another fondly-remembered candy bar from a more youthful era is a bar called "Zero". It's covered in white chocolate; and it, too, is a taste treat! And that particular sweet-tasting confection is also available to order here at Amazon.com as well. So stock up!<br /><br />"Oh Henry!" candy bars were always a favorite of mine from decades gone by, and it's nice to know that you can still buy these rather hard-to-locate chocolate goodies somewhere. I don't think I've seen this brand of candy available at supermarkets in many years. Maybe they are available in some areas, I don't know. But they're good hunks of candy, I know that for sure.<br /><br />There is also a "peanut butter" version of the "Oh Henry!" bar available too. I've never had the pleasure of consuming one of those however. But it, too, sounds good.<br /><br />Just don't buy too many at once, or you'll never stop eating 'em. :)<br /><br />Here are a few bits of info and trivia regarding the "Oh Henry!" candy brand...........<br /><br />The "Oh Henry!" candy bar was created in 1920 by the Williamson Candy Company of Chicago, Illinois. It came to Canada through The Lowney Company in 1924 and has been one of Canada's leading candy bars ever since. The "Oh Henry!" bar contains caramel, fudge, and peanuts, and is coated in a layer of milk chocolate. The bar was named after a boy who used to come into the Williamson Candy Company factory to flirt with the girls making the candy. Every time the girls needed something done, they would call "Oh Henry!".<br /><br />"Hershey Canada" acquired the Canadian rights to this bar from Nabisco on July 1, 1987. It is manufactured by Nestle in the U.S.A.<br /><br />The Oh Henry! bar is currently available in Canada in two flavors: Original and Peanut Butter. A limited-edition "Honey Roast" variety was also introduced in February 1999, and to huge success. The Oh Henry! bar consistently ranks as one of the Top 5 candy bars across Canada.<br /><br />Oh Henry! is the favorite bar of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball club. For the past 10 years, Oh Henry! has distributed 25,000 Blue Jays' baseball-card sets to lucky fans. Sets are also donated to fan clubs and charities across Canada.

He requires a lot of grooming and I normally use this product right after bathing him so he smells fresh and clean and every 2 days when I brush him to freshen up his coat.  Also I use it after walks when he is really smelly as I live in a city apartment.  Everyone compliments him and I has stopped buying dog perfume or sprays as they dont serve a purpose and the smells fades right away.

review/summary: Bichon Beautiful Spray
review/text: I have been using Fresh n' Clean for 12 years now and still love it.<br />It's great at making my Bichon Frise look as though she's just had a bath<br />and grooming.<br /><br />Spray it on and brush it out.  One fluffy white ball is delivered.<br /><br />When working on a area that is crusty or gooey, like under the eyes from tearing, I spray it on a clean soft paper towel and apply it with my hand rather than spray her face and get it in her eyes or nose. I let it soak for a couple minutes and then remove the hard particles with my fingers and brush out the rest with a soft, small grooming slicker.<br /><br />If your dog is like mine and likes to mop up her bowl with her face, or stick her snout where it doesn't belong, this will save them a dreaded bath.<br /><br />I've used many other spray products over the years thinking they were all the same or because the local stores didn't carry Fresh n' Clean but none of them fluffed and whitened her up like this does.

review/summary: It lacks the "it" factor
review/text: On a 5 star scale I consider 2.5 starts as average. Since Amazon does not allow for half ratings, I put in 2, but consider this item a 2.5 star rating of average. Needless to say I purchased a bottle of HP Sauce and promptly tried it with a meal. It is sweeter and more one-note in flavor than I was expecting. It's neither catsup (sweet), nor Worchestershire (complex) nor A-1 (a bit of sweet and complex). It is somewhat sweet and vinegary, but the "complex" I was hoping for did not come through for me. For example when using Worchestershire or A1 the tongue picks up numerous levels of spice, sweet and savory that I did not get here. To be clear, HP Sauce is pretty good, but for me at least, it will not replace the aforementioned sauces.

review/text: A few weeks ago we had a picnic party where several couples had kids who did not like fresh fruit. We purchased Cherry mixed fruit cups (as well as Dole Mandarin Oranges Fruit Cup, 16-4 Oz. Cups) as an option for desert hoping to please them. I am happy to report they they liked the fruit cups!<br /><br />Mandarin Oranges was the favorite choice with both kids and adults, the kids seem to enjoy Cherry Mixed fruit as well. However, at the end of the day there were no Mandarin Orange cups left but a few Cherry fruit cups remained uneated. The fruit cups are 80 calories and 18 grams of sugar which is pretty good (a fresh apple, for comparison, is on average is 80 calories and 15 grams of sugar)<br /><br />I recommend these fruit caps as an option to a healthy desert!<br /><br />**NOTE**: at the time of writing this review the photo did not match the product. This is NOT Dole brand, this is Del Monte brand fruit cups.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

Do not feed anything with Menadione Sodium Bisulfite. They will often call it Mendadione, Mendadione Sodium, Bisulfite Complex or various combinations of the words.

Out of all the instant miso soup types on the market, this is the one you want.<br /><br />The only complaint about miso soup I hear from Westerners is that when they try to make it themselves, it turns out too watery. Japanese have miso in much smaller bowls than your average cereal bowl, so if you don't have the right type, just use a large mug. That keeps the water-to-miso ratio at the correct amount, so you'll be able to get the full, delicious flavor.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/text: When I first opened this package I grabbed a packed & put it into a cup of hot water, too bland, needs seasoning.  Then I read the pkg.(DUH)  1 for seasoning & 1 for the tovu/seaweed. The printing on the envelopes are different colors - but they are all silver so did not stand out as separate packages. Not bad after I used both. Not as good as the package in the store (Lipton I think, perhaps Knorr) but for camping, quick traveling, they are just what I wanted. Will order again. Price is certainly great!

review/text: I really like having miso soup with my lunch at work.  I saw the Hikari Instant Miso Soup, 40 servings, and I thought that this would be a good deal. I like instant miso soup that has the paste and the packet of tofu and dried seaweed better than the powder mix so I was really looking forward to trying this.  Well, I was little disappointed.  The miso has a different taste to it compared to others that I have tasted. It was rather bland, too.  So, overall, this is just okay. I probably won't buy it again.

review/summary: Good tasting soup - "Instant" is a bit of a stretch.
review/text: I thought the taste of this soup was very good.  Each serving comes in two packets.  One contains the dried seaweed, some spices I think, and the dry tofu.  The other packet - and here's the part that makes it less than "Instant" for me - the miso comes in a separate packet labeled "Miso Paste".  The miso paste is squishy and liquid, a little messy, and definitely not the powder form I was expecting.  I'm guessing that the paste form tastes better but I was hoping for something I could just dump into a cup of hot water and not have to wash my hands after.  And that isn't the case with this stuff.

review/text: Product was good but I quickly discovered ordering something like malt (which is ordered by the pound) it would be cheaper to purchase this type item from your local supplier (even if the price is a little higher). Unless you don't have a home brew store within driving distance this is probably not the way to go.

review/summary: Whole Leaf Fan!
review/text: If you like canned spinach, Del Monte Whole Leaf is for you! I tried another brand of chopped spinach (on the label, it has a famous cartoon sailor with one squint eye, unusually large forearms with an anchor tat, a pipe in his mouth ... and he is one of my childhood cartoon heroes) and it had a lot of water with some spinach in the can as opposed to Del Monte Whole Leaf which is largely spinach with some water. I like mine with a little salt and vinegar. It is a good value on the "subscribe and save" program otherwise the shipping is prohibitive. Low on strength? ... Eat your spinach for more "muss-culls"!

review/summary: Popeye would approve!
review/text: If you have ever "craved" spinach (I know -- I must seem odd), you will like this.  The first choice is of course fresh spinach but that is not always possible. Frozen is good too but may not be readily available either.  So if canned spinach is your remaining option, this is a superior brand.  I like to add it into dishes where it's not expected -- it brightens the final dish surprisingly.  I particularly like it in pasta dishes. And, of course, it has all sorts of goodness nutritionally!

review/text: The first time I ordered this coffee from Amazon, I thought it was excellent, it had a bold, rich taste.  The 2nd time I ordered it, it didn't seem to be the same coffee, lacked the bold, rich taste.  It was still a good cup of coffee, but not the same; maybe Cameron's changed the "formula" because the packaging was different.  Coffee is really a matter of personal taste, so don't take my comments as the definitive answer. I would still try it again! Thus, 4 out of 5 stars.  (Like I said earlier, coffee taste is a personal choice.  I'm still looking for the BEST tasting coffee available! Anybody?!  Until then, I'll keep trying!)

review/summary: very chocolatey and a good flavor of mint.
review/text: Beside the fact that even a diabetic can possibly enjoy these, and they are a good energy bar without a sugar spike etc. They also taste quite yummy. the texture is somewhat like a cake brownie, and the mint is sort of mild like an Andes mint. Not real strong. The choco flavor is like a dark chocolate. I love the fact that it is supposed to help keep ones energy up and cravings down. Haven't eaten enough to vouch for this yet, but we went ahead and subscribed for this and the peanut flavor for the monthly shipments to gain the extra discount. Figured we couldn't go wrong.

This is by far the best energy bar I've ever tasted.  Try it!

Kind of tasted more like a cross between  Manhatten style clam chowder (75%) and pepper pot soup (25%). It had some spice to it, but not the bite that real pepper pot soup has. A pretty good deal from Amazon for 6 cans for $21 however.

review/summary: Oh Yum! I had these as a child in England.
review/text: I was a little reluctant to buy these Turkish Delights because I remembered that they were big and soft; I don't like soft candy, but I love firm chewy candy. Well, I got them in the mail and opened the box (which didn't match the picture, as the other reviewer noted), but the picture is not what I'm after! These Turkish Delights are cut into 1x1" cubes and they are perfect for just popping in your mouth. The sweet Rose flavor doesn't hit you at first, but then it gets stronger and smoother the more you chew. They are very firm and, boy, do you have to chew, since these have those lucious nuts in them. I am so pleased with these Turkish Delights that I've got to buy more, for my whole family! The only things I might comment on are: there are not very many nuts in the candies, no where close to what the picture shows, but they are very lovely candies anyway, and I hope these are stocked forever -- without the hugh hikes in prices I've been seeing.

review/text: I have sampled turkish delight all over Turkey and this is among the best I've had.  I was surprised that the candy is VERY fresh, and also delicious;  it is nearly (admittedly not quite!) as good as the Mustafa Hafiz brand, for example, which was my favorite in Istanbul.  For the price (less than $5 a box), you really can't beat this, especially given the high quality.  Also,  you can give this candy to vegans and vegetarians because the Turks typically don't use animal products in their candy (like gelatin)---Hazer Baba uses corn starch for their thickener, and the ingredients list is all natural.  I keep this on hand as an emergency gift and so have given this to many people, all of whom rave about it!

review/text: Delicious decaf tea!  Don't know how Good Earth did it, but they created a masterpiece in this tea. And one GREAT bonus: it doesn't stain your teeth like black tea and even green tea do.<br /><br />I wish Amazon would offer this decaf version through Subscribe & Save, to bring its price down.  Amazon sells very few decaf white teas, and this may be the only *flavored* decaf white tea on Amazon.  Why does it have to cost so much more than the caffeinated version of the same tea?<br /><br />I'm puzzled by the review stating this tastes like butterscotch.  I would HATE tea that tasted like butterscotch and have never noticed any hint of that flavor or scent in this tea.  Perhaps the box the reviewer received had been stored near some butterscotch and absorbed its scent??  It DOES have a lovely, delicate aroma of vanilla (not overpowering; it blends nicely with the other scents of this tea), so if you dislike vanilla, this would not be the tea for you.<br /><br />I love tea; our family owns and drinks many kinds. However, this is my favorite decaf white tea.  Its flavor is delicate yet refreshing.<br /><br />I bought mine at a local grocer and am so disappointed that they don't carry it any more. I haven't been able to find it lately at *any* stores. It's one of the few teas I'm willing to purchase by the case.

review/summary: Great decaf option for green tea lovers!
review/text: I recently had to stop drinking caffeinated beverages because they were making me jittery.  My favorite reasonably priced green tea was Yamamotoyama green tea.  I loved that tea because it tasted clean and refreshing, and it had a great color to it.<br /><br />I kept searching around for a decaf option and found this on sale at the grocery store.  I did not like this tea at first--since it was different.  The color is certainly not as pleasing to the eye (it's not such a bright green).  However, it has really grown on me.  It has a hint of lemon grass too, which took some getting used to.  However, now I drink it all day long at the office.<br /><br />And the best thing is, this tea doesn't bother my acid reflux or give me heartburn.  Sometimes, teas can also make me feel a little nauseated sometimes.  However, this one is gentle on my stomach as well.  A great product.

So, unfortunately it went into the trash.  While others may like it, this one just isn't for me.  Although, I will say this is the only tea I have tried thus far from Good Earth that I didn't care for.  As a whole Good Earth teas are my fave, I buy the Decaf Green Tea with Lemongrass by the case.

review/summary: Great substitute!
review/text: For what this product is, it is great. I know what normal mac n cheese tastes like, but for medical reasons, I cannot eat any of the ingredients that go into it. I made this tonight with broccoli and enjoyed every bite. I used the so-delicious unsweetened coconut milk creamer as a liquid. I mixed the sauce mix and creamer really well in the pot with a whisk and cooked it until it was thick, then added back in the macaroni and broccoli, added a bit of water and cooked it a little more. I don't think it would have been as good if I followed the box instuctions exactly (not pre-cooking the sauce) or didn't use the creamer (I also used a bit of Herbamare and more nutritional yeast (about 1t.)). I am sad that the other two reviewers had bad results, but I LOVE this product and can't wait to get my hands on more.<br /><br />Yes, I am aware that this is a glowing review that sounds like I am associated with them somehow...but I'm not. If you've ever been in the situation I am in (craving "normal" foods but just cannot have them) and you find something half decent for a replacement, you'd understand the sheer joy! :) Happy eating!

review/summary: not really like mac and cheese, but now awful either
review/text: I am a chosen vegan but I know what mac and cheese tastes like, so I am expecting a lot in a substitute I want it to taste like mac and cheese. Now that being said, no this product does not taste like mac and cheese. It actually has a kind of strange taste, like something funky, but not cheese :-) My daughter is 3 and she took one bite and refused to even eat that bite.<br /><br />I made it by using a hand mixer to really get the powder to emulsify into the almond milk i used, i also used a little avocado oil...is there a way to prepare it so it tastes better? maybe, i guess if you used cheese and butter, lol, I am just kidding. Its really hard to duplicate those flavors, so this product is trying its best to fill that need. And the company seems to be pretty stand up, but cheese just has some huge shoes to fill.

review/summary: Carol Moseley may be an ambassador of social justice...
review/text: .. But she clearly isn't an ambassador of taste. I really wanted to like this tea, and had every reason to believe I would: it's organic, and organic foods tend, in the main, to taste better. The ambassador line of tea touts itself as "biodynamic" (a marketing term for sustainably produced) and is fair trade certified, which is wonderful. Sadly, it tastes slightly less good than, say, a dustbin of sweepings from a woodshop floor. As a connoisseur of tea, I have tasted somewhere in the vicinity of 4 or 500 varietals, and can't think of a single one more flavorless than this one. Into the compost pile goes this $20 worth of tea. Don't suffer for a good cause: buy another brand of tea, and if Moseley's mission is important to you, just donate directly.

review/text: Totally agreed with A. Dowd's comment/review.<br /><br />- This green tea tasted horrible and bitter. Bought a lot of pretty good whole leaf tea from China and been drank a lot of Ten Ren tea in the bay area. The Ambassador Organics Green Tea is nothing close and I am throwing them away after one cup. As a comparison, anything you can get from Saveway is better than this.<br /><br />- Also one of the tin boxes came in empty, totally empty and the other tin was dented. I had to believe either this was an used/open product or there was problem in the wearhouse. Glad Amazon resolved this issue for me, thanks!

Prince Charles did not associate his name with his organic cookies, no doubt out of concern that political brickbats would weigh down the product instead of allowing it to stand or fall on its own merits.  This tea is of fine quality.  I suppose there are those who prefer to rag on personalities, but I think the food ought to speak for itself.

He was amazed they were dog treats (& may have still tried one, had I not been around). Vet approved & made in the USA, you can happily give them to your dog knowing they are safe, unlike all the 'Made In China' treats always on recall for making dogs sick. Sized like a real cookie, they give a bigger dog something to chew a while, while also soft enough for a smaller dog to break apart. They also come in 2 separate sealed bags, so they stay fresh. Wonderful product - Cinco gives 2 paws up!

review/text: Do you love hamburgers? Do you feel guilty about the fat and cholesterol of beef patties? Here's a suggestion--try bison burgers.<br /><br />More and more farmers are raising bison for their meat.  It has less fat and cholesterol than beef, but it tastes pretty good!  When making bison burgers, the key thing to remember is that they are quite a bit leaner than beef burgers, so you can't cook it as long or it really dries out.<br /><br />That said, the end product tastes fine and is better for you. Bison burger over a bun with some thin onion slices, tomato, mustard, and cheese, and you have a tasty treat!

The coating melts at anything above 60 degrees, so prepare to get fingers smeared if you open one from your purse.<br /><br />I was super bummed they didn't taste better, the nutritionals are decent and no sugar -- 2 stars and not 1 for that.<br /><br />I also discovered that I am one of those people who experience "gastric distress" from Malitol...30 minutes after I ate one before going grocery shopping.  They say, "never shop hungry," I advise never go ANYWHERE after you eat one of these before you know how your body will react. Delightful.<br /><br />Bummer for me, hope they work better for you :D

review/summary: Good Tast, Messy Hands - Still Recommended
review/text: These thinkThin "100 Calorie Cookies and Cream Bites" are good tasting and are surprisingly filling, but they are also messy for your fingers. These are not like Oreo Cookies as pictured on the box, but are rather a soft chocolate cake with a white creamy coating that, sadly, becomes gooey at even room temperature (I am keeping these in the refrigerator). If you have to eat one warm, you can just open it up and use the wrapper to hold the cookie.<br /><br />The taste is better than most "diet" snacks and they are also diabetic friendly at less than 7 Net Carbs per bar and only 100 Calories. Like another reviewer pointed out, these do contain Maltitol and that can cause "gastric distress" that varies in severity from person to person, so you might want to see how these effect you before enjoying one of these and heading out to your weekly Book Club meeting.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I'm a big fan of Syrian food, and decided to try this mix because it's not very easy (or cheap) to get all the ingredients to make my own falafel where I live. Well, I followed the instructions on the box (except for deep frying- I pan-fried mine and they turned out fine), and it's just about as good as my favourite Syrian restaurant!<br />The mix also makes an interesting batter for other fried/baked finger foods- less carbs, and slightly nutty- a healthy yet still tasty crunch. Will definitely be buying this more regularly :D
