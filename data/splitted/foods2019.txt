review/summary: Horrible taste
review/text: Don't be fooled by the nice packaging and promises made in the description, you won't get passed the the first pouch. It just tastes like something went horribly wrong at the Eboost factory and they decided to sell it anyway, the taste is a mix of NiQuil, Kool-Aid and alka seltzer.<br /><br />For the sake of this review, I drank the whole thing just to see if I felt a difference, well, it didn't boost my energy level, the only thing that I came got out of this was an upset stomach.<br /><br />I was really hoping to like this product, and I still think it's a great idea for people on the go, EBoost just has to really work on the flavor and put a little kick to it, make me feel energetic! Oh and while you're at it, make the pouches easier to open, it took me a while to get this thing open since I didn't have any scissors on had, do a little pre-cut on the pouch, that would help.

review/summary: Doesn't work if you can't drink it...
review/text: This sounded like a fantastic opportunity to add flavor and nutrients to my everyday water.  As someone with fairly intensive fatigue after 6 months of chemotherapy (for rheumatoid arthritis) I'll take all the help I can get...  The packaging is convenient, the powder is sugar free and supposedly energy boosting.  Sounded good to me...<br /><br />The packaging is easy to open and attractive.  Made me feel like I was about to enjoy something fun and funky.<br />Alas, it was funky.  And not in a good way.  I only took a couple of sips because the flavor was not my speed- too tart and dry, a bit chalky, instead of quenching... It has ascorbic acid providing vitamin C and due to G6PD deficiency, I avoid products with added ascorbic acid as it can cause red blood cell oxidation and lead to hemolytic anemia.  For people who are not G6PD deficient- it isn't a problem and if someone likes the taste of this it may be beneficial to them, or it may not. If they are uber-acai pomegranate fanatics than maybe they will enjoy the taste... I'm a pomegrantate fan but I'm starting to thing that acai tastes like the first syllable of the word acai, or maybe I have just tried the wrong products with the flavor.

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: This product tastes awful! I mixed it with water per the directions and watched it begin to fizz, which was pretty cool. But the taste of this stuff is terrible. It reminded me of Golytely, that nasty drink required before a colonoscopy. I finished the 8 oz glass, but soon after began to feel nauseous. The drink also left a yucky aftertaste, much like the diet drinks of old that contained saccharin.<br /><br />On the positive, it contains a lot of vitamins, which is probably why it tastes so awful. However, I would rather pop a vitamin pill than drink this again. And while it claims to boost your energy, it contains caffeine, which may have something to do with that.<br /><br />If you really want to try this, I highly recommend that you hold your nose and chug it down. Then, eat something or chew gum to get rid of the aftertaste. As an alternative, I recommend taking a multivitamin with a glass of water. If you need that caffeine boost, drink a cup of coffee or have a cola.

review/summary: Gross!
review/text: This powder is nasty gross!  The color is like pepto bismol, and it tastes about as bad as that too!  The fizz factor in the powder is way too strong and it fizzes up so much that you need a tall glass that holds at least two-three cups.  I tried to mix it in a medium size glass and added under a cup of water.  The fizz was so strong it overflowed the glass even with little water added.  It is way to sugary tasting and has a really nasty cough syrup like taste.  The ingredients include great stuff like green tea extract, acai berry and other anti-oxidants, so I was disappointed that I couldn't even stomach drinking it.  Emergen-C is infinitely better.

review/summary: Horrible taste
review/text: This drink has a strange sort of fizziness to it. It's not fully carbonated by any means...it's sort of like a milder Alka-Selzer. And the flavor isn't much better. There isn't much pomegranate flavor...it's very light. What I taste most is the vitamins. It honestly tastes like you're swallowing a vitamin pill. Not at all pleasant.<br /><br />I'm not usually that picky when it comes to my food or drink, but I simply couldn't stomach this one. Having said that, I wasn't able to finish the drink. So, I can't fairly speak to the effects of the drink on my energy and so forth. But, I did have enough energy to pour this one down the sink.

review/text: Well, it does not taste much like a pomegranate drink. It is a bit fizzy when mixed and the particles didn't completely dissolve so the drink was like a sweet, fruity seltzery antiacid drink. It is a good way to get some vitamins, but don't expect a quick lift of energy to accomplish some physical activity.

review/summary: A fizzy hydrating drink
review/text: I was only provided with one single-serving (about a teaspoon of the mix) with which to review this product...not an easy task; I stopped by my local health food store to buy some additional product in order to be able to give better feedback. Doesn't taste fantastic, but is OK enough to accomplish hydration.<br />My overall impression is that it tastes like a fizzy G*torade...but a healthier version; actually, it is more like Alacer's Emergen-C products, which are available here on Amazon, as well, and can often be purchased at a less-expensive pricepoint.<br />The manufacturer's website states that EBOOST has:<br /><br />  * NO sugar<br />  * NO artificial colors<br />  * NO artificial flavors<br />  * NO high fructose corn syrup<br />  * NO crystalline fructose<br />  * NO soy<br />  * NO gluten<br />  * NO lactose<br /><br />The biggest concern is the overall cost...I would say it is worth a try if priced to be competitive with Alacer and other similar products.

review/text: I filtered 8 ounces of water with my Zero water filter and poured the contents of the package into the water.  It fizzed like everybody else said.  I stirred it and the bubbles became even more active - much more than an Alka-Seltzer tablet.  Plop, plop, fiz, fiz.  It smelled a little like raspberry Kool-Aide, but taste was not pleasant.  I swallowed about three gulps and poured out the rest into the sink. It has a very strong after taste. Yuk.  Thankfully, I only received one packet of this stuff.  I would never pay a dollar per packet for this stuff.  The contents say this has acai and green tea leaf extract as the main ingredients.  I think the energy boost is supposed to come from caffine in the green tea. I didn't feel anything, but of course, I poured most of it into the sink.

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: I received one pouch of the EBOOST Acai Pomegranate daily booster from the Vine Program. Here's my take on it.<br /><br />It's touted to be an energy booster and full of electrolytes, but each packet contains 20 calories and 4 grams of sugar (print is so small I'm reading with a magnifying glass). Each packet contains 100% of your daily needs of chromium, copper and zinc, and 143% of your daily requirement of selenium. The EBOOST blend contains 340mg of Acai fruit and green tea extract. No mention of pomegranate.<br /><br />To use: Snip the end off the pouch and pour contents into a glass with 8 ounces of water. It's supposed to fizz, however, my packet did little of that. I am not a fan of colored beverages and the bright pink color was a bit of a turn-off as it looked artificial, though the packet says it's from beets.<br /><br />It did not have a pomegranate taste, but it also was not a pleasant taste. It seemed as though it was flavored to hide the vitamin taste, and didn't quite succeed.  Also, it comes with a warning for anyone taking prescription drugs or with a history of high blood pressure, heart problems or pregnancy, which certainly doesn't sound like a health drink to me. At $1.17 per pouch, it is pricey. I feel there are far better alternatives on the market.<br /><br />I was not impressed.

review/summary: Not what I was hoping for...
review/text: I'm kind of addicted to pomegranates at the moment, so when I saw this product I decided to give it a try.  I was looking for a nice energy boost since my workouts have been getting a little more regimented, so I figured this could be the start of something nice.  What I didn't expect (and maybe this is a common occurrence in the `energy drink' market that I'm just not privy to) was for this product to have the consistency and texture of medicine.  Seriously, it was like drinking `Airborne' or `Alka-Seltzer'.  The minute I poured the packet it began to fizz, which was an instant turn off, and then once I had it stirred in (which it never really completely dissolved) I tasted it and it was rather chalky.  I was an unpleasant experience to say the least.  The flavor was NOT pomegranate, or if it was it was so faint that it was completely swallowed up by the chalky medicinal overtone.  Maybe the other flavors are better, but as far as I'm concerned I'm not quick to reach for another packet of these.  The energy boost was marginal, nothing extraordinary enough to validate drinking this mixture again.

review/summary: E-BOO !!
review/text: I found this product to be a major disappointment.  I tried the Acai Pomegranate flavor.  It did not taste like either acai berry or pomegranate to me.<br /><br />To use the product, you snip open the packet and mix the powered contents with 8 ounces of water.  It mixed easily and dissolved completely.  The taste was tolerable, but not pleasant.  It was sort of like a bland kool-aid as I drank it, but with a slightly tart aftertaste.<br /><br />As far as being a healthy energy drink, while it has several ingredients which are good for you, the aforementioned fruit flavors, as well as vitamins B-12, C, and D, and some minerals such as zinc, it also contains caffeine.  The maker states that the caffeine is naturally-occurring from green tea extract and is equivalent to the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee.  I am not a crusader against caffeine, but what goes up must come down, and if you are going to get "energy" from caffeine that's not really energy in my opinion.<br /><br />I don't think there are any bad things in the drink though, no abundance of man-made junk sweeteners and so on.<br /><br />And it is true it has a good dose of vitamins in it.  The B-12 dose is huge at 2,500 mcg.  You may reap more benefits some vitamin supplements and a nice cup (hot or cold) of green tea, and if you need it you'll still get a dose of caffeine in the tea.<br /><br />Considering the poor flavor, the caffeine "energy" and the price, well over $1 per drink for the packet of powder..... in the end I found Eboost to be quite a let down.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good for a Drink Pouch Mix But Still a Drink Pouch Mix
review/text: This is supposed to be an energy drink, and, to that end, it contains caffeine from green tea extract.  It also contains electrolytes, some vitamins and minerals, a bit of sugar, and something that makes it fizzy.  I drank a pouch mixed in water, and it didn't taste much worse than other drink mixes - it's maybe even a little better than some of the artificially sweetened ones.<br /><br />If you are looking for this to be really super tasty, you are going to be disappointed.  If you are looking for something to flavor your bottled water and give you a bit of a jolt without too many calories and without any artificial sweeteners, you might be okay with this.  It's got only 20 calories, and it's nowhere near the nastiest low calorie beverage I have ever consumed.

review/text: This product seems to be a definite cut above average.  When dumped into water, it dissolves quickly and completely.  Raise the resulting mixture to your lips, and you're in for a treat.  I had the pomegranate flavored mix:  very slightly effervescent, very tasty, mildy sweet with just a touch of tartness.  As with many sports related drinks, the EBOOST comes with a long list of difficult to establish claims.  I can't state that I smashed any personal records after drinking it, but this much is true:  it was pleasant to drink, rested easily in my stomach, and gave me a mild and pleasant boost in energy.  Placebo?  Who knows, and since it felt good, who cares. I liked it better than any of the other drinks that I've tried over time, and if the price is reasonable, will be using more of it.

review/text: The powder smells like Kool Aid. Adding water makes it foam for a minute. At that point it tastes a little creamy, which I actually liked. But it quickly subsides into a flat drink, both in texture and flavor. The good thing is that it's only slightly sweet, but the rest of the flavor is pretty awful. There is a moderate amount of sourness, finishing with a slight bitterness reminiscent of biting an aspirin. The flavors of acai and pomegranate are vague at best.<br /><br />As for claims of boosting energy and metabolism? I don't feel more energetic than I normally do. The ingredients read like a multivitamin with salts and acai/green tea/etc. The claims made on the manufacturer's website for each ingredient sound dubious, and pretty lazy at that with each ingredient described to do the same exact thing. I doubt any studies were conducted to verify their claims.<br /><br />I'm sticking to drinking real green tea.

It would probably come in nice after a hard work-out if you mix it in with ice cold water.<br /><br />It doesn't have a heavy taste and is not thick, so it would be good if you are working out, and don't need to worry about upsetting your stomach. It is also not really really sweet either, it has just the right sweetness to it.

It dissolves well, and doesn't taste bad, but I can't say it tastes great either.<br /><br />I've used a number of these types of products mostly to give some flavor to water more than to get any health benefit.<br /><br />There are lots of similar products available. Try a few different products and stick with what YOU like. Each product has some combination of "special" ingredients that are used to differentiate them from each other. I didn't think this product was anything special.<br /><br />If you want less expensive water favor, try Crystal Light On The Go, I liked the Lightly Lemon version.<br /><br />Some of these products flavor 8 oz, and some 16 oz - so when evaluating cost/benefit make sure you know how much water it flavors. Eboost flavors only 8 oz, but costs the same as some of the 16 oz products.

review/summary: How EBOOST is different from others...
review/text: The EBOOST will fizz. For those who love soda pop, the flavor should grow on you as a slightly healthy version of that.<br />Get a 12 ounce bottle of water. Drink off a few ounces. You need the water anyway right?<br />Pour in the packet and let fizz. Put on lid and give it a few shakes.<br /><br />The taste is bad. It's about like the crystal light energy drink in similar packet. That one tastes like straight citric acid.<br />If you're needing caffeine and would like some vitamins to enhance your energy level, then this is a good alternative to soda with all that sugar or fake sugar. Cane sugar is unrefined and slightly less glycemic as regular sugar (meaning raise blood sugar levels) and isn't stripped from its natural nutrients. It's more pricey than the stuff we usually get.<br /><br />So, if you're wanting to try a new energy drink, then you can try this. If you already drink coffee regularly, it might be a nice non-teeth-staining alternative. It's not going to WOW you with energy, but can help if you get drained in the afternoon and need a pick-me-up.

So I gave eboost a try.<br /><br />Use-<br />Snip the tube and dissolve in 8oz of water vs the 4-6 oz for emergen C. That was a plus.<br /><br />Flavor- I got the pomegranate flavor and it was quite intense. Ingredients say its is all natural. Sweetener is "Cane Juice Crystals" which I guess is the code speak for sugar. It was very sweet, to me it seemed almost had that artificial sweet aftertaste. Overall the flavor was acceptable.<br /><br />Content -<br />The first thing I didn't realize was that part of its energy boost was from caffeine from the green tea extract. It has 110mg which is the average amount for a cup of coffee. I try to avoid caffeine as it gives me the jitters, I won't knock my rating for it, caffeine just isn't my thing. Just be aware and use it accordingly. If you're a coffee drinker I think it would make a dandy alternative to a cup of joe.<br /><br />It has a wealth of other things in it<br />20 calories<br />5g carbs<br />4g sugar<br />Massive doses of vitamin C, D, B-12<br />Most or more than your RDA of Niacin, B6 and Folic Acid (Folate), Zinc, Copper, selenium  and Chromium<br /><br />Then you've got 340mg of herbal extracts including<br />Pomegranate, reverstoral, agave, mango, Gingko, Stevia and more.<br />Is that stuff useful in a powdered, dissolved extract? I don't know but its in there.<br /><br />Conclusion-<br />Overall I would say this is good stuff. It's got a lot of good things going for it and a decent taste. Too bad it has the caffeine, but if that's not an issue don't let it hold you back. It's a good nutritional supplement.

review/summary: Delicious, healthy, easy... yes please!
review/text: Although it's not much more than a drinkable vitamin, the benefits of EBOOST drink packets include ease of use, great taste, and the fact that they encourage you to hydrate. And the vitamin benefits of course!  I don't personally buy-in to the whole "improve your focus and boost your performance" thing, but if you're like most Americans, you're lacking in vitamins and minerals, so drinking this can only help.<br /><br />The Acai Pomegranate is delicious; not too sweet, not too sour, and not overwhelmingly "fake fruity" flavoured. I recommend drinking this very cold; the closer it gets to room temp, the more you can taste the vitamins. With ice, you can hardly taste the "healthiness" at all!<br /><br />I love the simply slender packs because they're easy to carry in a bag, pocket, etc. and you can toss them in a desk drawer at the office. I don't love the eco factor of single-serve packs in general, BUT I took some solace in seeing that EBOOST is a member of 1% for the Planet, so at least they're giving back.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the earlier reviews re. mixability, foam, etc., although it didn't bother me nearly as much as it did others.  I also mixed it with more than 8oz of water and it was fine - in fact better, in my opinion.

review/summary: Healthy options!
review/text: Two of the most important factors when considering a powder additive to water for me is TASTE and CONSISTENCY.  This Acai Pomegranate powder dissolved quickly and easily into my cold water AND had a great taste.  I dislike drinking plain water, but know that it's good for you, so this is a great alternative for me.  Adding the goodness of these two great fruits is a plus and as I said, it is good tasting, too!

review/summary: Like a Gatorade with a fizz
review/text: This product is an electrolyte (like Gatorade) that is helpful when you want your body to be replenished with essential minerals after much sweating. It also helps yoru body to retain water when necessary. The ingredients contained in eletrolytes such as this is used when treating people with uncontrollable diarrhea (Cholera often the main cause)so its ability to hydrate people is almost second to none.<br /><br />The main difference between this and Gatorade is that this product fizzles when water is poured. The taste is the same bland taste except this one has a pomegranate flavor. The fizzle also makes the taste slightly more sparkly than the Gatorade.<br /><br />As a user of similar Gatorade packs, I can ascertain the amount of powder in this packet is significantly less than the Gatorade version. That means this packet isn't as effective if you pour lot of water as you can do with the Gatorade packs.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good product if you want a fizzly Gatorade-like drink to hydrate yourself after much sweating or a workout.

review/summary: Seven reasons why I did not enjoy this product (but flavor is a matter of personal preference)
review/text: I personally did not enjoy this product.  However, taste is a matter of personal preference.  In an effort to help you decide, I'll provide the list of things that I noticed:<br /><br />1.  Inconvenient for the product to be mixed with 8oz of water, instead of the more standard 12oz.;<br />2.  Heavy foaming when pouring the packet may not be appetizing for some;<br />3.  Doesn't fully dissolve, leaving white specs on the bottom of the glass after thorough stirring;<br />4.  The flavor was very mild, and a little sour;<br />5.  Shortly after mixing, the texture was more like a little mild chalk was mixed in--there was no fizz;<br />6.  The color was a slightly cloudy dark hot pink; and<br />7.  My stomach was a little unsettled after drinking 1/4 of a glass.<br /><br />I hope this helps your decision.

review/summary: Best Natural Energy Drink Out there - Beats 5 Hour Energy
review/text: After trying so many energy drinks, I was skeptical to try EBOOST.  I've used Red Bull for pick me ups (too much of a high and then a crash), 5 Hour Energy Fuel (too expensive, and no noticeable difference), and many, many others.  I'm the type that tries many products before giving up on a category, and I had almost given up...until I came across EBOOST.  EBOOST is sold in many stores, including high-end stores likes Equinox Health Club, Virgin America, W Hotels, and a lot drugstores.  It's a deceptively simple packaging - which made me doubt the effectiveness of it.  However, after a friend urged me repeatedly to try it, I gave in and bought the Acai Pomengranate.<br /><br />Boy, was I surprised.  I absolutely adore, ADORE the fizziness of the drink.  The taste is divine - I love it.  It's a tasty, bubbly drink once you put the EBOOST powder in a cup of water.  The "up" was strong enough to be noticeable, but I didn't feel any jitters.  I just felt more concentrated, more focused, and had more energy.  After maybe 4-5 hours, it disappeared slowly and I didn't feel a "crash."<br /><br />I feel fortunate that I tapped into the network of "in the know" people.  Athletes and celebrities alike use this product because of its healthy dose of vitamins and natural lift in energy - with no crash.  This has become a fave of mine - and I can't wait to try their other flavors.<br /><br />EBOOST, for me, is a lifesaver.  I have so much going on with my life and EBOOST allows me to keep up the pace! Thank you EBOOST!

review/summary: Healthy Alternative? - I'm not convinced.
review/text: Eboost is supposed to supply energy and health.  I went to their website and did not find any convincing evidence that it did either of these things, except for some "testimonials" from users.  I did notice that a mineral ingredient highlighted on the package was copper.  Although the link is not certain, there have been studies that link copper intake to Alzheimer's risk.  Will the very small amount (2mg) of copper in a serving of this product increase your risk of this disease?  The answer is almost certainly no, and some copper is in most foods to to some extent and in most multi-vitamin pills. However, I personally am trying to avoid products that contain any added copper.<br /><br />The drink claims to be an alternative to "over-caffeinated and artificial "energy" products"  However, caffeine is the first or second largest ingredient in the product (varies depending on flavor).  Why is adding caffeine to a product not "artificial energy?" According to a website that listed caffiene content of various products, an eboost drink contains  about the same caffeine as 2 cans of soda and is similar to many "energy drinks" out there.  I think the claim that they make is a little deceptive.<br /><br />When added to water it fizzes, like alka seltzer.  The taste is acceptable, but not great.  It taste like fruit flavoring, not fruit.<br /><br />Although it does contain sugar and flavorings, most of the ingredients seem be from "natural" sources, which is good.<br /><br />I tried it and did not find any energy boost, other than what I might feel after drinking a caffeinated soda or two.<br /><br />In summary, the "health" benefits of this product is what the marketing material stresses. It's described as a "healthier, happier alternative for your daily health."  It may  be better for you than a can of cola, but as far as your health goes, I think you'd be better off with fruit or fruit juice.

review/summary: This one at least tastes good.
review/text: My daughter had this drink one day after exercising and she really really liked it.  Mind you she loves anything that is Acai so that may have had a bit to do with it but I tend to think she really did enjoy it since she does drink alot of the healthy drinks.  She said the flavor was mild and smooth, not overwheleming like some drinks can be.  She felt refreshed after drinking it also and said it gave her the get up and go she needed.<br /><br />The main thing I like about these drinks mixes is that they are not soda or those high energy drinks.  This is something that is more healthy and will replenish what you might have worked off with exercise or even after being ill and losing important nutrients there.  It's comparable in price with what you find in stores all over so you really can't lose out by trying it.

review/summary: Sadly this product doesn't live up to its name at all...
review/text: I was quite happy to give this EBOOST Acai Pomegranate product a try - after all, I love pomegranates and really like acai...I couldn't taste either of those flavors in this drink.  I added a pouch to 8 fluid ounces of water - it immediately begin to fizz and ended up making a tiny bit of a pink mess (this powder foams like crazy when added to water): strike one.  Then I gave it a bit of time to settle before giving it a try: wow, I was very taken aback.  The flavor is very mineral-y, both from first taste all the way thru to after-taste, where it gets even worse, way worse: strike two.<br /><br />I took a look at the package quite a bit closer then, to see if all this was worth it, at least hoping to find some type of super-positive health boost worth all the foaming, and mineral (yucky) flavor: there wasn't anything. Strike Three.  I agree that these minerals and vitamins are good & necessary, but I wouldn't use this particular method to get them: there are much better products on the market to take in things this powder touts like zinc.  And that's that...<br /><br />And to end, the product is pink.  Very pink.  Now, I like pink, but I was taken aback by this: my main complaint is this doesn't taste like acai or pomegranante at all, so it just doesn't live up to its name.

review/text: I could not find mixing directions, so I mixed it with about 8 ounces of bottled water. The resulting drink tasted very medicinal, sort of like a medicated cough-drop. It wasn't awful, just not pleasant and certainly there wasn't a strong presence of pomegranate. The acai must be responsible for much of this, but the other suppliments may have played a role. I didn't notice anything perticularly boosted after taking it (I usually have a cafeinated soda or cup of tea), so it wasn't worth going through.<br /><br />I would have given it fewer stars, but I just had one packet with which to evaluate this and I presume those buying it are doing so for perceived benefits of the ingredients and not for the taste.

review/text: Hard to describe the flavor, but it is comparable to other Acai type drinks out there.  Bold and dark just comes to mind.  Comparable to Dragonberry Vitamin Water.<br /><br />I think the pouch idea is great, easy to carry around and jazz up a bottle of water in a small pre-measured packet.  That being said, the Acai pomegranate mix says 8 ounces, but I mixed it in a standard water bottle which I believe is 12-16 ounces and I thought it still tasted good.<br /><br />I purposely let it sit after a few sips to see if the powder mix was well mixed and it was, no clumps of powder at the bottom.<br /><br />The sugar content, etc was reasonable, far, far better than any soda drink out there. I'll consider some out flavors to throw in a water bottle, shake up and just have a better tasting beverage. :)

review/text: This dietary supplemental powder drink has some pretty good ingredients.  One pack makes 1 cup of drink for one pack per day.  Looks like hot pink fruit punch and taste like carbonated fruit juice with an artificial sweetner-like aftertaste (note, there is NO artificial sweetener in the packet).  It's the kind of taste you could grow accustomed to, but I'm not so sure what the real benefit is for the price.  Here are the ingredients:  Acai Pomegranate, Vitamins C,D,B-12, Zinc, Reservatrol, Quercetin, Green Tea Extract, cane juice crystals, natural flavors, potassium carbonate, citric acid, malic acid, beet color and silica.  Nothing amazing in there.  Has a warning to consult a physician before use if you have high blood pressure, heart problems, are taking prescription drugs, or are pregnant, nursing, or contemplating becoming pregnant.

review/summary: Disgusting Taste
review/text: Sorry, I don't like panning a product but there is no where else to go with this stuff. The label is too small for me to read the ingredients and I don't seem them listed online other than in reviews. One reviewer says it "contains 20 calories and 4 grams of sugar (print is so small I'm reading with a magnifying glass). Each packet contains 100% of your daily needs of chromium, copper and zinc, and 143% of your daily requirement of selenium. The EBOOST blend contains 340mg of Acai fruit and green tea extract."  I'll take their word for it.<br /><br />I have no way to assess the health value, nor did I feel any energy boost. However, I can tell you I didn't like the taste. It was very sweet but maybe not sugary, which I also wouldn't like but more of an artificial sweetener taste. If you want sweet colored water with a nasty aftertaste, this may be the drink for you. Otherwise try something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009RF8KG">Emergen-C Vitamin C Fizzy Drink Mix, 1000 mg, Raspberry, 0.3 Ounce Packets, 30-Packets</a>

It provides a little jolt of energy via B-vitamins and some caffeine.  They boast other natural energy boosting ingredients like Acai, but I can't speak to that.  The vitamin content rivals Emergen-C in some cases and beats it out in many others.  There are a number of additional antioxidants and fruit-based compounds in EBOOST that can't be found in Emergen-C or some other vitamin drink mixes.  There's also cane sugar for taste.<br /><br />You can't get passed the salty, oily vitamin taste but the cane sugar makes it tangy and sweet with no aftertaste.  I rather enjoyed my sample of this product.  Unfortunately I cannot give it 5 stars as my Vine sample was but a single packet.  There's no way for me to comment on one of the most important aspects of these types of products -- their effectiveness over time.<br /><br />But I have to say that I did enjoy my single packet and I would recommend others try this product as an alternative to other vitamin jolt drink mixes.

review/summary: Pretty good-tasting with good ingredients
review/text: This is an easy-to-use product (just mix with water) that has a pleasant taste and contains good ingredients. I can't say I got a super power boost from it, but it mixed well (not too thick as other reviews say), quickly, and tasted good. Pomegranate is good for the body, and acai is a new item on the market (one of the wonder foods) that has not been tested enough to know if it actually lives up to the claims that have been made for it. The latter is almost certainly not bad for you, but we won't know for a while whether it is something special.

review/summary: Where's the Boost?
review/text: I tested this Acai-Pomegranate energy boost drink as part of the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />When the product arrived, I'd thought Amazon had mailed me an empty envelope.  Until I peeked in and saw a single small tubelike pouch smaller than a pencil.<br /><br />I added it to H2O in my Stainless steel water bottle.<br /><br />Argggghh!  T'was a bitter flavor, saccharine-sweet, with a chalky after-taste.  It had a glowing pinkish color I'd not ever seen in Nature.  I poured some into a styrofoam cup with ice, then it wasn't as bitter.<br /><br />Did it give me an energy boost?  Did I have a great workout because of it?  Did I feel better for consuming it?<br /><br />I only had the one pouch to try, and can honestly say I couldn't tell any difference.<br /><br />Perhaps if I'd had several pouches to compare over a week or so, I could report more conclusive results.

review/text: Although I am on a blood pressure med, I went ahead and tried this anyway. I doubt I was able to choke down enough to affect my med, because the taste was terrible. And I'm a fan of pomegranates, so that's not the issue. EBOOST tasted bitter and medicinal - there are much better, more palatable, ways to boost your immune system.

review/summary: Delicious and Energizing
review/text: Skipping my usual coffee in the morning, I elected to try the Acai Pomegranate eboost. I am not a fan of energy drinks because of the crash that inevitably follows them. But as Eboost says you will not experience a crash, I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm very happy I did. First off, it smells and tastes better than some other brands I have tried. The pouches are easy to open and it just requires 8ozs of water - although you could add more water if the flavor is too sweet for you. As you stir the powder in, a frothy, fizzing, delightful drink forms. You'll start to feel the effects of the boost almost immediately. The alertness stays with you for a good part of the day - about as much (if not more) as a strong cup of coffee will carry you. You do not feel a "crash" but you will have a gradual decline in your energy as the day progresses - which you'd expect anyway without the drink. No headaches, though, which is fabulous! I slowly sipped my energy drink - making the effects not so strong as downing it in one gulp.<br /><br />Reading the package information, this drink is not recommended for those who have heart/health issues. I can understand why because it does increase your heart rate a little, but not much. You also might feel a little shaky at first. If you have questions about your particular health issues, or if you are taking medications, I would seek your doctor's opinion before trying any energy drink. Also, be sure to only drink the recommended dosage - ONE pouch per day. I also would not mix this with any sodas/coffees/etc. for the day. The boost you get from this energy drink is enough.

review/summary: Not for my faint heart
review/text: I'd love to love this product, really I would.  The way it's touted, it sounds like it's energy and health in a powder!  But it, frankly, scares me a little bit.  The warning labels state that, if you take prescription drugs, you ought to think twice about drinking it.  I am on two blood pressure medications and a blood sugar medication, so I sipped a little bit of my single free pouch, mixed with cold water, on an empty stomach. For full disclosure's sake, I did not drink the entire mixture.  Within five minutes, I could feel the "energy" being released...vroom, vroom.  Lotsa caffeine in this product, I think!  It mixes well into water with my immersion blender.  The color is an odd Pepto-Bismol pink, rather than a deep pomegranate red.  The taste is, in my opinion, not natural, but rather tinny and acidic, with an aftertaste of artificial sweetener.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this, but I can imagine lots of 5-Hour Energy drinkers and other energy drink consumers would, thinking it's "good" for them.  There are lots of people who think Sunny Delight is OJ, that Raisin Branch Crunch is full of good carbs, that Lean Cuisine is actually good food pre-prepared, etc., and I think eBoost belongs to those folks...let 'em dream.

The package indicates it has some vitamins and health benefits, but it tastes so completely awful that you're better off buying a bottle of water and a packet of Centrum vitamins.  There is nothing about this that is remotely like acai or pomegranate.  Save yourself some money and do not buy this.  Horrible, horrible taste.<br /><br />What does it taste like, you might wonder?  You know Robutussin cherry?  Once you swallow and the cherry flavor goes away and all you are left with is the aftertaste?  This tastes like the aftertaste alone, no cherry.  Yuck yuck yuck.

review/summary: No, Thank You
review/text: I have tried several energy boost supplement drinks and thought this one might be good.  I sampled the Acai Pomegranate flavor, and it did not taste like acai berry or pomegranate.  The flavor was intensely sweet and the mixture a bit slimy--even with additional liquid.  I didn't like the texture of the drink at all.  As for ingredients, it seemed to have all the vitamins associated with energy boost, though it also contained caffeine.  That's a big turn off for me.  If it had tasted badly but still gave solid results, I would just choose another flavor.  I'm not interested in a caffeinated product.  I also found the packaging difficult to open and resorted to scissors.  Not very efficient for those on-the-go.  It may be a great flavor for some, and the caffeine may not be a bother.  I won't invest further in this product.

review/summary: Comme Si, Comme Sa
review/text: The package is a tube which you will need to snip open and pour out the crystals into your water.  At first there's a slight foaming action and then after a few seconds of stirring, the crystals dissolve. The result is a somewhat non-natural transparent magenta color and a flavor much like Kool-aid. (I couldn't help but think of Jim Jones at this point.)<br /><br />Since there isn't any clear instructions, I suppose you could mix this into your own choice of water amounts. I used about 7 ounces and the flavor was not unpleasant, so I took a few gulps. I didn't get the medicine-like flavor that many other reviewers here seem to have experienced, but instead a berry-flavored drink (if an artificial strawberry/raspberry flavor could be called that) that seemed to have an artificial sweetener added. Not fantastic, but not totally horrible either.<br /><br />If I were 14 and wanted a sugary, artificial, kool-aid-flavored energy drink, this might be something I'd try but I'm old and already having had my strictly regimented doctor-ordered 1 cup of coffee, I didn't drink the rest for fear of caffeine overdose. It's too bad they couldn't have just given the mix some natural energy booster instead of caffeine, but it's nice to know I got some vitamins while I was gulping.<br /><br />My real problem with the product is the lack of instructions. I suppose one could even eat this right out of the package if they wanted, but since it's a drink and not candy, that might be overkill.

review/summary: Eboost Pomegranate is Tolerable, but That Isn't Saying Much
review/text: A boost of energy is often necessary over the course of a long day and there are plenty of energy drinks to help a person reach his/her desired level of alertness. I used to reach for the ever- reliable cup of java during these moments, but I have found many good energy drinks that get the job done with better effectiveness. Eboost makes several energy boosters and one of them is Eboost Acai Pomegranate, a powered drink mix loaded with nutrition and energy- enhancing ingredients.<br /><br />This is the second Eboost product I have tried and after the horrific experience with the first product, Eboost Pink Lemonade, it is surprising that I would even think of trying anything else with the Eboost name on the label. However, I believe in being fair and there was always the possibility that this experience could be better. So, I mixed my packet with water and hoped for the best.<br /><br />Starting with the appearance, this product isn't too bad. It has a scent like one would expect- slightly fruity and similar to a watered- down fruit juice drink or a glass of Hi- C. Its body is a little fizzy, which is fine with me and helps make it at least interesting. A quick read of the label shows that it contains some important minerals and a mega- dose of vitamins like Vitamin B complex. The doses are probably a little much, but if it adds to my energy, I can accept it.<br /><br />Now, it is time for the tasting to begin. Wow....I'm having a tough time with this one. The taste is slightly fruity, tart, and a little medicinal in nature. There is an alka seltzer- like quality to this product that, again, makes me think I am drinking medicine and not an actual beverage. There is an aftertaste, too, and it isn't too pleasant.<br /><br />Ok, so what about the energy? Let's see....I'm not feeling terribly energized but I do feel a little better than before. What I am uncertain about is whether I feel better because I am energized or feel better because I am no longer drinking this beverage.  I have had better experiences with other energy drinks and the obvious boost that some provide, but there is some good with this product. I feel about the same way I do after a couple cups of coffee.<br /><br />So, I guess my final verdict on this product is that it is only so- so as an energy drink and less than desireable in terms of taste and other qualities. It isn't as foul as Eboost Pink Lemonade (I had nightmares for days after that experience!) and it does offer some good nutrition, but the flavor and other factors lead to an overall rating that is still below average.

However, I thought it tasted pretty yummy.<br /><br />It gave me a bit of a boost I admit.  Now, be warned, this is not a caffeine free drink.  So if you like to go caffeine free, this is not the drink for you.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this product is the description said that some of the proceeds go to breast cancer research.<br /><br />So, I'd probably use this as an afternoon pick-me-up, but replace my morning coffee?  Probably not.

review/summary: Weird, but I liked it
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect of this energy-drink powder. The list of ingredients looked promising, at least, so worth a try.<br /><br />I poured it into a water goblet, added a little water and *foom*, it foamed up, almost overflowing the glass. After a short while it settled down and I was able to fill the rest of the glass with water, producing this gorgeously colored shocking fuchsia beverage. The pictures in the product listing do not do it justice.<br /><br />The taste was... well, kind of meh. Strong notes of caffeine and vitamin, slightly tart, and sweetened primarily with stevia, which has its own weird aftertaste. (I like it, but I'm strange that way.)<br /><br />The energy lift was gentle, pleasant, and lasted for a few hours. The single-serving sample I got for review was free, but after I tried it I intended to buy more... until I saw the price, at over a dollar per packet! I could buy some pretty nice energy drinks, already made, for that much.  Now I'm not so certain.<br /><br />Overall: nice color, nice lift, but mediocre taste and too expensive.

review/summary: The only thing it's boosting is my negativity towards the product line
review/text: I already reviewed the EBOOST pink lemonade flavor and thought it sucked, but decided that it wouldn't hurt to try a different flavor and see if my experience changed...it didn't! The acai pomegranate EBOOST powder works just as well as the pink lemonade one; that is to say, it doesn't work at all. Instead, you pour it into your glass and mix it with water, it foams up BIG time in an interesting fuchsia foamy color, and then as you mix it it settles down into just a big fuchsia glass of liquid (see my uploaded photo to see what it looks like). The taste in my opinion is not terrible. Pomegranate is kind of bitter to begin with, so if you're expecting it to be some really sweet concoction then you're barking up the wrong tree. This does have a slightly sweet taste, but is more overpowered by the bitterness. If you drink it all in one go, it's really not that bad. But the reason for dropping the product down so low is that, just like the pink lemonade variety, it doesn't work. It is supposed to boost your energy and your mind and all that, but my experience was that it made me feel no more energetic, gave me a slight headache, and boosted my negativity towards the product line.

The one advantage the Eboost had was it's liberal amounts of vitamins B-12, C, and D, and small amounts minerals such as zinc, along with some naturally occurring caffeine. However, if you can't get past the taste, you can't enjoy the benefits.

review/summary: Bittersweet energy mix
review/text: eBoost is similar to Emergen-C and similar immunity/energy boost products with some good and bad qualities. First, it has a handsome collection of vitamins comparable to Emergen-C with quite a bit more vitamin B12 (for increased attention to energy) and less vitamin C. eBoost will certainly give you a boost of energy as it's fortified with 110mg of caffeine (more than what's in a shot of espresso). I prefer my energy without caffeine (which will make you crash despite the eBoost claim to the contrary). Second, the flavor is pretty bad. Vitamins don't taste good, that's clear, but Emergen-C tastes neutral comparatively and the generic version of Emergen-C has excellent flavor.<br /><br />I like the proceeds going to cancer research, but the actual product is bittersweet in more ways than one.

review/summary: Unpleasant taste, but healthy
review/text: When pouring the drink mix into 8oz of water, it definitely bubbled quite a bit, so watch out.  After mixing it up and taking a sip, I found the flavor to remind me of cherry flavored medicine, with an aftertaste of chalk.  While I appreciate the many vitamins included in the mix, I think they detract from the drink's taste.  This is the reason I don't care for vitamin water, either.  I'm the kind of person who would rather take a daily multivitamin, and drink something later on that I actually enjoy, instead.  For those of you who enjoy drinks with tons of vitamins (and the associated vitamin taste), and want energy without caffeine, this might be for you.  Acai and pomegranate have lots of antioxidants, which is the reason I bought it.  But I'm going to just stick with plain old acai juice.

review/summary: Gross taste, fun fizz
review/text: (Note to Amazon-Vine Admin: I don't know how I am supposed to form an accurate opinion with one tube of the product. This is the best I can do)<br /><br />This was pretty gross. The best part was watching it fizz. First I wasn't sure how much water to add & I didn't have my microscope, the package print is truely microscopic. After a moment or two of squinting I saw the 8 oz. of water directions & did my best guestimate in my water bottle.<br /><br />There was a lot of pink fizzing action. And a pretty pleasant fruity smell. When the fizz died down, I gave it an experimental taste--and the first sip wasn't totally awful. Then the bitter kicked in. It was still vaguely fruity on the front of my tongue but seriously bitter in the back. I got no pomegranate or acai flavour.<br /><br />As to the healthful effects of the vitamins & such...with one tube, who can say. I am, in some ways, glad there isn't more because of the nasty taste. But I can't guage whether my e was boosted or not.<br /><br />This is ground up pop-rocks and Flintstone vitamins in a tube with unsweetened Koolaid. Take it to your next Harry Potter-themed party and use it in the potions for effect.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I like the idea of natural energy boosting drinks with vitamins and natural ingredients instead of caffeine, but I didn't care for this product at all. I added 8 oz. of water to a coffee size cup and the fizziness caused it to overflow and end up all over the counter top. Unless you use a large size cup, this will probably happen. The flavor was just okay. Foamy, especially at first. Sort of fruity, but a little artificial tasting. It left a slightly salty, vitamin-flavored aftertaste in my mouth. I was hoping for a more natural pomegranate taste. It may have helped a little with my energy level, but not a big difference. There is a health notice on the packet that suggests people check with their doctor before using this product if you're taking prescription medication or have certain health conditions, so that's something to keep in mind. Also, I think it's very expensive for only 30 packets. I'd expect at least 100 packets for that price. This isn't a product I'd use again.

review/summary: Not bad, but too expensive
review/text: I've tried this flavor and the lemonade, and this is much better. Not what I'd call good, but at least drinkable.  I like the idea of drinking powdered vitamins because taking a lot of different vitamins is kind of a pain and a little time consuming, and would consider buying this product if it weren't so expensive.  EmergenC is about half this price, so I'll probably go with that.

review/summary: Eboost Acai Pomegranate drink
review/text: How do I describe this drink? Nasy and sweet tasting. It didn't taste like pomegranate, it tasted like sweet Alka Seltzer. My husband and I both tasted one sip,and both said "gross!" at the same time. It might give you a boost with the caffeine, if you can get the strength to drink the whole eight ounces. Sorry, but I won't be tasting this drink again, we dumped it out. Others might like this, but we couldn't get past how sweet this drink was, and how it left a nasty after taste.

review/summary: Too Expensive: Tastes Pretty Good
review/text: If money were not an issue, I might take the Acai Pomegranate instead of my daily Nuun.<br /><br />The Nuun tablets may not have resveratrol or quercetin, but like eboost, they are just 3 to 5 calories per serving.  The difference is that 48 Nuun tablets are $18, whereas 30 eBoost packets are [...] (as of 11/27/2010).<br /><br />eBoost does contain maltodextrin and sucralose.  Nuun uses sorbitol.  Pick your poison I guess.<br /><br />if you take eBoost in 8 oz of water, it will knock your socks off, I definitely recommend at least 16oz, if not a liter of water.<br /><br />The label does state "Take 1 packet every 12 hours or as needed but do not exceed 4 servings a day".<br /><br />The "do not exceed" message on eBoost is most likely due to the fact that it contains "Anhdrous Caffeine" (only one Nuun product does: Kona Kola - 20 mg, eBoost does not disclose how much caffeine is in the product. )

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I typically love the tartness of pom juice and used to like POM Wonderful.  I don't buy it often because it's so expensive, but recently needed some for a recipe.  I went to 2 stores and couldn't find it in the small bottles without some other flavor mixed in.  So I bought the big bottle, thinking "well at least I'll enjoy it".  Alas, no.  It tasted watered down.  More sweet than sour.  I even got a second opinion and that person agreed that it wasn't as tart as before.  I don't think I'll buy this brand again.  Of course, being less tart will appeal to lots of other people.  I'm only speaking for my own taste buds.<br /><br />I gave the same review on POM Wonderful's website, but it hasn't appeared.  It disappeared into the black hole of moderator-ship.  Maybe they changed their processing procedures and don't want anyone to know.

review/summary: True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade
review/text: I'm not much of a water drinker.  I want to be, I just have trouble with the tastelessness of water and thus fall into the trap of guzzling down sodas both for the caffeine and for the taste.  Which is a habit I'd really love to stop.  The problem with most drink additives though is the ingredients.  All those fake sugars and I figure I might as well be drinking a soda.  So then I saw True Lemon at the store and the advertisement that it was 100% natural.  So I thought why not try it?  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I started off with a little box of 10 packets of the Raspberry Lemonade to see how I would like it.  For drink additives it was pricey, but no more (and actually a little less) than if I had bought a case of the same amount of soda.  So I won't complain about the price especially considering this is better for me.  They came in little packets that were long and tubular shaped and easy to get open.  You just pop the top of your water bottle and pour the contents in, getting a little show in the meantime of the powder coming up like smoke from the bottle.  Hey, it doesn't take much to amuse me.<br /><br />The taste is pretty good.  I think I taste more of the raspberry and sugar than they do the lemon, and that's why this product doesn't get more than four stars from me.  I would have liked to have had it be a bit more tart instead of just smooth and sweet.  But it's still not bad.  It goes down smooth and one packet is enough to flavor 17oz of water quite strongly.  It also turns the water a nice pale pink color.<br /><br />As said before I was strongly attracted to this product because of its ingredients.  Instead of artificial sweeteners, stevia is used.  It also has lemon juice and other natural flavors.  Nothing in the ingredient list looked too bad so I'm happy.  And according to the box its only 5 calories, which isn't too bad either.<br /><br />Definitely a product I'd try again, and I'll probably end up trying their other flavors as well.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011

review/summary: Very good taste and natural based sweetener
review/text: Well, I used to drink other flavored water beverages, just because plain water gets boring sometimes.  However, most of them are expensive, this is very cheap when mixed in with a bottled water.  The obvious cost savings aside, let me get down to the taste...<br /><br />I think the taste of this is PERFECT!  Not too sweet, and not too plain.  To compare, I consider the Kool Aid packets too sweet, and the True Orange Crystallized Fruit Wedge is too plain.  The Stevia based sweetener this uses is also supposed to be the most healthy one, and certainly safer than Aspartame.<br /><br />I've been taking a packet of this and a bottle of water to work for several months and I'm not tired of it yet.  It mixes up quickly.  I normally open and sip a little water out of the bottle (to give more air to shake it), then add a packet, shake it up, and it's ready.  I drink it room temp, if the water is colder it might take longer to absorb.  It leaves the water with a light pink color.  Oddly enough if you leave it alone for over a day it becomes almost clear, I'm not sure why that is but the taste is unaffected.

review/summary: Nice taste, VERY low calories
review/text: This is one of the many stevia sweetened drink/drink mix alternatives that have come out over the last few years. I like the stevia taste better than popular no-cal sweeteners, which I dislike so much that I won't drink. However, to me it still tastes somewhat like saccharine and has a bit of an aftertaste. When we prepare a drink with this mix, I pour in a few drops of RealLemon lemon juice. Those who have tried this trick agree with me that the acidity of the lemon juice helps to solve both taste issues mentioned.<br /><br />The Raspberry Lemonade flavor of this drink is quite pleasing ... not overpowering but also not too diluted tasting.<br /><br />While not especially low cost, these packets of mix do cost less than a soft drink, and flavor 16 ounces of water, rather than the 12 you'll get in a soft drink. They cost somewhat less on Amazon than they do at our local grocer, and the grocer doesn't even carry this flavor ... only the straight lemonade flavor.<br /><br />This is not calorie free, but at 5 calories for 16 ounces of drink its close enough. ;-)

review/summary: A delicous, buttery tuna for people who can't stand fish (like I)
review/text: ---<br />Bonito del Norte is the very best-tasting tuna in the world! Better than fresh tuna I think. This is coming from me, someone who doesn't like fish at all. When I was little, and my father cooked fish, I started to gag and had to run out of the house, I hated that smell. I still hate that fishy taste. In a pinch, I will eat Albacore (white) tuna, but even that sometimes makes me gag (because I just am not able to stomach fish), and most of the can goes to waste, because I never want to touch it for weeks afterwards.<br /><br />BUT! Bonito del Norte (not necessarily this particular brand, which I do enjoy) is the champagne of tuna - it tastes so mild, and buttery, it has its own distinct flavor, in between fish and meat. Best of all is the texture, very firm and dense.<br /><br />When I was little, my family got to stay in my aunt's house in Spain, off season, when she couldn't rent it out to anyone else, and this was my favorite food: fresh baguette, and Bonito del Norte on top. A little bit goes a long way. You can spread a little mayo on the bread, and then put just a few pieces of this tuna on top, very sparingly (not like in American tuna sandwiches). It's the best. The taste is so exquisite, you can just open the can and eat it out of the can with a fork, without mayo. If you do use mayo, use very litte, as not to overpower the delicate taste.<br /><br />Wikipedia states that Spaniards call Albacore tuna (white tuna)  Bonito del Norte  That may be so, but the Bonito del Norte that is canned in Spain tastes totally different from the Albacore tuna normally available in the supermarket in the US, even the most expensive brands. Starkist sells a White Tuna in olive oil, which should theoretically taste the same as the Bonito del Norte in olive oil, according to Wikipedia, but that's not the case. The American Albacore white tuna has a much stronger, coarser taste. The Bonito del Norte has  buttery taste, which manages to be delicate and at the same time concentrated. Therefore a litte goes a long way.<br /><br />Yes, Bonito del Norte is always expensive, even in Spain, but I hope that you try to taste it just once in you life, which is why I'm writing this review.<br /><br />PS I have had fresh (very expensive) Ahi tuna in Hawaii, grilled. It was good, but still too fishy. I've made tuna salad out the leftover cold Ahi, with mayo the next day. That tasted better, nice and firm meat, less fishy than eaten hot. But for me, nothing in the world can touch the sublime taste of this canned Bonito del Norte.

Now, there is no going back for her either. The flavor is rich and the meat is not just shreds. Enjoy...

review/text: The Bonito del Norte is unlike any canned tuna you've had before (and better!).  I'm always on the lookout for a good deal on this product. I wish Amazon would add Ortiz Bonito del Norte to their Subscribe & Save list (hint, hint).
