review/summary: Best tasting Almond milk drink out there.
review/text: I was looking for a good alternative to Soy milk and found this. Tried a couple of different almond milk drinks on Amazon, but this one tasted the best.<br /><br />Great dark chocolate flavour. Makes a great pre/post workout protein drink.<br /><br />Keeps going out of stock at Amazon.com and the price sold by third party sellers are ridiculous. Just have to check often and buy more than one pack at a time.

review/text: This is def. great tasting almond chocolate milk, but 30 bucks for 24 8 ounce, seems crazy considering the regular almond milk is half the price, but its convenient non refrigerated and easy to travel around with. Other co. are half the price at the store, but they are not as good.... oh well!  Would bu again, but will look around for a better price.

review/summary: Yum, almond and it is chocolatey!
review/text: So hard to find a replacement to a dairy chocolate milk, and along this path of over 3 years, we have found something that is made from almond milk, the sugar feature is low on list of ingredients.... Life is short, so nice to find a 'healthy' replacement from lactose and other non-dairy products.  It also as vitamins and 50% more calcium than dairy!  Yeah.  Tried the smaller box at a health food store before bulk buying!,  it actually taste chocolatey, and not watered down, although the gar gum is in there, it helps and not harmful.

review/summary: Good cracker but not what I was looking for
review/text: This cracker was good but not exactly what I was hoping it would be. I was looking for something more healthy than the typical cracker which was why I bought it. The cracker by itself would be a good snack on its own, but I think the flax seed may make it a bit oily so when I paired it with cheese it didn't really work.

review/summary: Back to Nature Multigrain Flax Seeded Flatbread Crackers - 5.5 oz.
review/text: The crackers are made in Madison, WI by Back to Nature Foods Co.--made in the USA.<br /><br />I have a difficult time eating just a few crackers.  These are the best crackers I've ever tasted.<br /><br />They actually don't taste much like crackers.  They taste like fresh baked flatbread.  The texture is fresh and crunchy.<br /><br />The seeds get in your teeth but they're worth it.  This is a large hearty rectangle shaped cracker with seeds throughout.<br /><br />The crackers taste great eaten alone or with dips and toppings.<br /><br />The crackers contain unbleached enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folic acid) whole wheat flour, unbleached wheat flour, safflower oil, golden flax seed, cornstarch, whole grain millet, potato starch, brown rice syrup, brown flax seed, whole grain triticale, whole grain barley flakes, whole grain rye, whole grain rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, malted barley extract, sea salt, leavening (backing soda, monocalcium phosphate), garlic powder, parsley, onion powder, and vitamin E.<br /><br />The box has 6 servings (3 pieces).  Each serving is 120 cal., 4.5 g fat, 1.5 g polyunsaturated fat, 2.5 g monounsaturated fat, 90 mg sodium, 65 mg potassium, 18 g carbs, 2 g fiber, 2 g sugars, and 2 g protein.<br /><br />The package states that the crackers contain no artifical preservatives, flavors, or colors and no hydrogenated oils.<br /><br />I give these crackers 5/5 for flavor, 5/5 for freshness and texture, 5/5 for quality of size, 5/5 for environmental consideration, and 0/5 for truth in labeling--thiamine mononitrate is synthetic B1.<br /><br />The package is made from 100% recycled paperboard and the co. supports the Nature Convervancy--protecting nature, preserving life.

review/text: I was excited to see an all-natural soda at my drugstore made with cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, but one taste of this was all it took to decide never to buy this again. I like pomegranate juice and expected to like this soda, but it did tasted more like medicine than soda.<br /><br />All the cans in the store were dented and some were leaky. The aluminum is very thin and all the sodas got partially crushed and damaged during shipment. This is something to consider when ordering.

review/summary: very tasty tea indeed!
review/text: I'm a bit of a tea junky- not a snob by any means, but I know when a tea offers a lot of flavor- and this is certainly it.<br />I wouldn't recommend it to someone who, perhaps, doesn't like ginger- because the ginger can be a bit more overpowering than the orange.  Still, it's a great evening drink, as it is naturally decaffeinated. (makes me want to run to the kitchen and make some right now!) It has a nice aroma and the tea flavor is pretty mellow.<br />Each tea bag is individually sealed in it's own foil bag- so each bag stays very fresh until use.<br />And the seller? Well, my order came pretty quickly, the tea was well packaged (no dents, etc) in the box. No complaints.<br />As I mentioned- I'm a bit of tea freak- with probably 8-10 different kinds in my pantry at all times. I'm ordering my next two boxes now, because I don't think I can live without this tea!<br />If you like ginger, orange and tea- this is a nice addition to your stock.

review/summary: break easily- would NOT recommend
review/text: I really like all the other Green Sprouts products, but these are a no-go. Both the spoon and fork were broken easily by my 9 month-old baby. The spoon he easily snapped in half and the fork was shattered by him pounding it on the high chair tray. Luckily I was right there because the utensils broken and shattered into small pieces that were very sharp. I think they could be very dangerous if he swallowed a shard or put the broken end in his mouth. I would not recommend these at all. Instead try the Green Sprouts silicone toddler spoon. It is soft and flexible and has not yet broken for me.

review/summary: Rather good.
review/text: Ordered these for Valentine's Days plans which never panned out, so I had them all to myself, and I think I got the better end of the deal.<br /><br />They were sent rather promptly, and arrived quickly. The packaging was intact, and there was only a slight dent on the top of the truffles from the packaging, but they were not some ball of gooey dough or anything.<br /><br />As for size, they're slightly smaller than a golfball, so be sure to have a sweet tooth before you order. Taste-wise, they're rather good. The cocoa is not overwhelming, and you can certainly taste the chocolate underneath. There's also enough of each truffle to give you a satisfying feel after eating one, as opposed to some of the smaller packaged truffles where you eat a dozen and only then realize half the box is gone, one of these at a time will do.<br /><br />The only real Con I can think of, is that I still tasted a bit of whichever oil they used to sure up the truffle (safflower, coconut, etc.), and it slightly took away from the chocolaty taste.<br /><br />However, don't let that stop you too much. They were plenty chocolaty, and I mean chocolaty, not loaded with sugar.<br /><br />For the price I ordered them at (around $3 I believe), they were a great little treat, and I've been remiss about letting the review go so long.<br /><br />If you have a few spare bucks to spoil yourself and don't mind waiting for shipping, grab these, or order the bigger pack. You won't be disappointed unless you're looking for the absolute top-quality truffles (in which case, you'll be spending ten times the amount).

It's unclear to me whether that means all the products used in the treat also are original to the USA.  Since the labeling is unclear, I'm not willing to give it a 5 until I know more.

Both of my cats are also overweight, so finding food that was both low cal and wouldn't upset my girl cat's tummy was a pain in the butt. I compared this food to some of the more expensive brands (twice as much per case) and the ingredients are identical. Each can has 150 kcals, so I feed my cats a can each per day. It's been a month and there have been no tummy issues, they are both slimming down, and their coats are nice and shiney. Very happy customer!

review/summary: Mmm... Mars bars! :-P~
review/text: I'm guessing you probably already know what a mars bar is, so let's just assume you like 'em. Not a whole lot else to say. If you haven't had an English style mars bar before, I would say that they're one of they're one of the nicer candy bars out there. Well worth trying for anyone who considers themselves a connoisseur of fine junk foods! Do be aware though that judging by some of the other reviews posted, they're NOT quite the same as the mars bars that some buyers may have been expecting.<br /><br />While prices do fluctuate, as of the time of writing this package of 24 will wind up costing you just a fraction under $1.42 a bar. Amazon does sell these bars in packs of more than 24, and bigger the pack you buy, the better deal you get. So if you are able to find a deal that translates as good value from where you sit (and especially if you qualify for free shipping), this seems as good a place as any to buy your chocolate fix. If not, hey, look elsewhere.<br /><br />I took a star off because... Well, just the obvious. Mars bars are bad for you, duh! So please, enjoy in moderation ;-)<br /><br />Theo.

review/text: My 91 year old father has been eating Mars Bars for years.  Recently he was admitted to a rehab center for a long rehab.  We purchase Mars Bars for him, 24 at a time.  He savors them, one per day, and has introduced me to them.  They are just tastier than any other candy bar I've tried in recent years.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Many snails
review/text: These snails are of a satisfactory quality at an absolutely inexpensive price. The reason for the lower rating in the stars is that, despite the fact that they are advertised as very clean I frequently have found grit and bits of shell, not enough to be off putting, but enough that I would not have wanted to serve them to company. The other complaint is the non advertised inclusion of pepper, not enough to be hot but just enough to create a bit of a bitter taste, even with rinsing. I have found the 12 ounce cans of giant snails, of this same brand a much better texture, freer of grit and even though a bit more expensive worth the price. At an even better level are the helix escargot if you really want to taste a higher quality.<br />These do not have to be stuffed into shells, I simply put them in a small oven proof bowl, after rinsing well and shaking the water off in a colandar - with chives, garlic, bits, a tiny bit of garlic salt and place pats of butter on top, pop them into a 375 degree oven for 15 minutes and they are ready.<br />Hopefully one thing that has improved and that I did not make part of the qualification for my review was the packing, it was done very poorly and many of the cans were dented on the bottom - they were replaced, but be sure to check your whole package if you order them.

review/summary: Superlative escargot
review/text: I bought a case of these before Christmas on a 20% off promotion.  I gave away a few cans as "stocking stuffers" but mostly we just ate them!  WONDERFUL.  This is a very reliable brand, perfectly tender and fresh.  The "very large" size is the perfect size for my escargot dishes and would also fit perfectly in smaller white mushroom caps.  I've kept my leftover "snail butter" (butter, shallots, garlic, parsely and cognac!) in the frig and we'll enjoy another can of these for Valentines Day with a fresh baguette.  Try them...you won't be disappointed and your guests will be blown away.  A whole CASE of these could be less than you'd pay for the same old/same old cheese,cold cuts, and chips for a single party.  Plan on six snails per person -- very rich.

review/summary: Good snails, good price
review/text: The only reason there are four stars instead of five is that one of the ingredients is black pepper which was not listed on the ingredients of the product on line.  Some of us are not supposed to eat black pepper.<br /><br />The snails themselves are quite nice with excellent texture and flavor, and the price was right.  We eat snails regularly, mostly in the traditional snail garlic butter, tossed with Tinkyada brand rice pasta.  That makes a delicious meal without the bother of stuffing snail shells and washing the things afterwards.

review/text: These escargots were a wonderful introduction to snails.  I had something in California that looked and tasted more like slugs than escargo.  I can not believe that anyone could ever obtain 'fresh' escargo, so this product (yes, I have had other brands) has to be the top-o-the-line, as far as I am concerned. Great with pasta & sauce!  Wish I couold afford to have them for mid-morning/mid-afternoon snacks.  Either the 12-count giants or the 24-count very large are great!  I cut the 12's in half for pasta (any sauce is great with them) and use the 24 count whole.  Great stuff, Roland!

review/summary: Escargots to the Max!!!
review/text: I fell in love with escargots many, many years ago, and have developed several recipes for them beyond the typical butter/garlic variety...and have been using the Roland brand for almost the same time frame.  It has, however, been very difficult to find them in local stores because we can only eat so many.  I was luck enough to find large cans (6 dozen) at the local Smart and Final store, but again, you can only eat so many at a time.  Luckily, I thought I would check on-line and found the 12 x 24 pack which is just what I need.<br />Thanks for carrying them.<br />BTW...I've attached my recipe for all you escargot lovers.  It's wonderful on toasted baguettes!!<br /><br />Escargots in Cream Cheese<br />Chef Bob<br /><br />1 can  Escargots (24 count)<br />1/4#  Whole Butter - unsalted<br />2 tbsp.  Minced parsley<br />1 tbsp.  Minced garlic<br />1 tsp.  Oregano<br />1/2 tsp.  Thyme<br />1/8 tsp.  Marjoram<br />4 oz.  Cream cheese or Goat cheese<br />t/t  Salt<br />t/t  pepper<br /><br />Combine all ingredients and heat just to melt together, (hot, but not simmering).  Saute for 5-8 minutes, stirring constantly...do not overheat or the butter will break.<br />Serve with toasted baguettes as a delicious appetizer.

review/summary: My Kitty Loves This Food
review/text: I know the front label says this food is for senior cats but my sphynx kitten is very active and this is also for active cats, so I figured I'd give it a try. I made a mixture of half Newman's Own Advanced with half of Kitten Chow (for the required kitten essentials!) and my kitty loves it. I like how this is organic and the nibbles are nice and hard to promote healthy teeth. I've also noticed my kitty's poop isn't stinky anymore because this food is of much better quality than the other so-called premium cat foods I've tried before. Tip: If you're feeding your cat a dry food mix and its poop stinks it usually indicates its poor quality - so upgrade. I'm going to continue feeding my kitty the mixture and once he's an adult I may switch over to feeding him just this exclusively.

review/summary: Good for my Cat!
review/text: With all the worries about recalled pet food I wanted something I could trust. I put it on auto-ship which lowers the price a little. My cat goes through one bag in a little more than a month and the whole thing will fit in her feeder (very convenient). She isn't a picky eater like other reviewers cats (although she turns her nose up at canned cat food), but she seems to like it just fine. When I received my first bag I wasn't about to do a taste test, but I did the sniff test. The organic smelled fresh and...well...like cat food, but the new IAMS bag smelled musty and sort of rancid. Shortly after when I was still weaning her off the IAMS cat food, I had an invasion of ants. Both open bags were under the sink in the laundry room and they went for the organic but didn't come near the IAMS. Maybe they know something we don't???

Compared to others, I thought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVIUYA">Newman's Own Organics Advanced Cat Dry Formula, 3-Pound Bags (Pack of 2)</a> was a little pricey but I didn't mind spending more for an organic cat food. My cat wasn't thrilled with the switch but she eventually took to it but without the relish she had for the others.<br /><br />Now that my cat has adjusted to it and I can get it easily enough at my supermarket, I'll probably stick with Newmans' and purchase it there. But I will definitely NOT buy it at Amazon!  It is way too expensive here which really surprises me.  Even the Subscribe and Save deal is no bargain.<br /><br />So my final words are ~ this is not a bad organic cat food but it is way too overpriced at Amazon.

I've tried sensitive stomach foods, indoor cat foods, hard vs. dry food, etc.  However, I've never purchased a pricier food for her.  With her vomiting about once a week now at least, I finally gave in and decided to try this and have been very pleasantly surprised.  First, she's only been eating it for about 2.5 weeks but so far, no vomit.  Second, she loves it and this is a cat that hates catnip, won't drink milk, won't eat soft food anymore and won't eat most other types of food.  The added bonus is that her coat is amazing!  She is so soft now and her coat is shinier than its ever been.  I definitely recommend at least trying this food.  I've stocked up on it!

review/summary: Newman's Own Organics Advanced Cat Food
review/text: Bless Paul Newman's heart. His services to the Feline Community are immeasurable. With four four-legged family members, health is an important issue. Two of my Kitties had difficulties eating 'ordinary' cat food. Allergies and even apathy ensued and I switched to 'Blue Buffalo' food. That worked for about six month. After this period my Cats wouldn't want to eat this food anymore. (Later I heard they had a recall...)<br />since I feed my rascals Newman's 'Own Organics Advanced Cat Food', the allergy and apathy of my two darlings has receded. Their fur coat is shinier than ever before. My Feline children lost weight and they eat less of the Organics Food, than they did of the 'Franken Cat Food and even Blue Buffalo. For all of those who like to be sure that they give their beloved critters only the best possible food without breaking the bank, I recommend to subscribe to Newman's and thus get it to the same price or even cheaper than the Frankencatfood.<br />Thank You Paul Newman for all You did to humanity and its pets and equally a big Mahalo (Thank You) to Nell Newman for keeping the family business in the spirit of her father. Newman's Own is the best. Period. (No, I don't get money for writing this;)

That means it doesn't contain any of the 'frankenmeat' that is in other non-organic pet foods. I know that I'm not giving them any of the 4-D meat (dead, diseased, dying, decayed) present in other non-organic pet foods. Google 4-D meats to learn what is in the usual brands. The extra cost is worth it because I don't need to deal with the expense of urinary tract infections and skin problems.

review/summary: Newman's Own makes my cats purr.
review/text: The two rescue cats who adopted me were both about four years old. Both had been surrendered, separately, by their owners and became best pals at the shelter.  When they agreed to come home with me, I began researching the best foods to feed indoor cats.  Books were ordered, articles were researched and we discussed, the cats and I, if I should begin preparing their food myself in order to make sure they got the nutrients they deserved.  I read the labels of almost every dry and canned cat food on the shelves of pet stores and grocery stores.  Then, I found a bag of Newman's Own on the shelf of my local grocery story.  I read the label and found this to be the first and the ONLY cat food whose ingredients matched those recommended by vets and authors. Better still, I could order the food through the Amazon subscription service and have it delivered to my door.  My mature, loving cats are healthy, happy, full of energy, have grown incredible whiskers and we couldn't be more pleased.  The cats experimented with both dry and canned Newman's Own and have settled on a daily combination that seems to work.  They now purr when the package arrives at the door each month -- and they clean their plates every day.  As their caregiver, I'd give Newman's Own cat food -- dry and canned -- the highest marks, and its availabilty spared my refrigerator and freezer from being filled with frozen packages of home-prepared cat food.

review/summary: Cat loves it
review/text: My cat, like most cats, is a picky eater.  So it is kind of hard feeding him because either he doesn't like the food or he gets bored with the food he likes.  He makes life a bit harder for me.  Luckily for me he like this stuff.  Now he doesn't wait for me to feed him, he goes right into the bag and feeds himself.

review/summary: eeewww! not so good!
review/text: according to the dietician at our vet's office this food has several elements at too high levels for cats. the most problematic being ash. our cat suffered from uninary tract problems soon after we switched to this and had to spend 2 days in the vet's office at a substantial cost. might be a good product but for our 14 yr old, it was not a good balance of ingredients.

review/text: I judge this product by my cat's reaction and health. She is not overweight nor underweight, she seems to like this product, she eats it easily but not greedily like it is junk food (which she has done with other brands). The price on subscribe and save is generally great, so overall we like this product and it is easy to purchase it from Amazon.

review/summary: Looks healthy but cat won't eat it
review/text: The first thing I noticed about this cat food is that it doesn't smell horrendous. I poured some into my cat's food bowl and she ran over and started devouring it. She didn't do that with the other brands I've given her (IAMS, Hill's science diet, the goodlife recipe). She seems to really like this food and she hasn't thrown it up. I'm not a vet so I don't know how nutritionally sound this product is, but it lists a lot of organic ingredients and it has chicken as one of the first ingredients. I'll post pictures of the bag with that information. I know Newman's Own is a quality brand (I use their pasta sauces and salad dressing) so I imagine this product is high quality as well. It sure seems to be.<br /><br />Update 8-16-12: My cat does not seem to like it anymore after the first week. I mixed it with her old food and she picks around to avoid the Newman's Own pellets. I tried putting just Newman's Own in one dish and the other cat food in another. She won't eat the Newman's Own when it's separate either. I guess she prefers the cheaper cat food.

review/summary: Great food for finicky dogs!
review/text: This review is for the Tiki Dog foods in general, not specific to this one variety. We have previously given our cats and dog Sharpie the Merricks canned food. But as they have had issues with recalls of late, many of the stores we go to have discontinued carrying it and we were pretty sure because of these recalls, we were not going to buy it anymore.<br /><br />Our dog Sharpie is very finicky. I have never met a dog in my life that has to be coaxed into eating. Part of this is because she is so submissive she has to be eating WHILE we are eating NEAR us as we are eating. If we're not eating or nearby, she seems to need approval that its ok for her to eat when her pack leaders aren't. But part 2 of this issue is she is very picky. And its not like we feed her Alpo crap either.<br /><br />But after the whole Merricks recall debacle, I bought a bunch of different brands of canned food to see which she liked the most. Tiki Dog was by far the winner and its not like I blame her. You take it out of the can and it LOOKS like food and not a foreign mystery loaf of something. There are chunks of shrimp and sardines and other yummy items that animals like. When we mix her dry food with it, she does not even hesitate. She eats her whole bowl in less than a few minutes where before it would take coaxing her to eat for a half an hour and then her not even finishing her bowl.<br /><br />This is more expensive than most but in my opinion, it is totally worth the expense. You really do get what you pay for. I would recommend the Tiki Dog and Tiki Cat to anyone!

review/summary: Unbelievably good (and easy)!
review/text: I've used Szeged paprika and was impressed with the quality.  I didn't know they made anything other than variations of paprika until today.  My boyfriend had 8 lbs of baby back ribs and wanted to try using a dry rub.  I had selected a rub recipe online, but had to pick up some ingredients from the store by his house.  I was surprised when I saw this premixed rib rub and figured I'd save myself some time and trouble.  I peeled the membrane off the back of the ribs, dried them with paper towels, and rubbed them down with a generous coating.  We let them rest covered in the fridge for about 6 hours.  He cooked them on the gas grill using indirect heat - about 325 degrees - for about 2-1/2 hours.  They were amazing - smokey and flavorful with a touch of sweetness, but also let the natual flavor of the pork come through.  These are the best ribs, dry or wet, we have ever had!  I'm imagining this rub's potential on boston butts and tenderloins...yum!  I'm headed back to the store tomorrow to pick up their other types of rub - if they're half as good as this I'll be impressed.

I will say if you expect a straight honey-mustard dressing, that's not what this is -- there is a definite taste of vinegar (which makes up a large chunk of the product).

review/summary: Much too expensive
review/text: I love this dressing.  I usually keep a few Walden Farms small pouches in my purse to have when eating out.  A few days ago I decided to order a bottle for home and didn't bother noticing the shipping and handling charges.  (Amazon's Prime Membership has spoiled me.)<br /><br />Today, at a small local health foods store I bought an overpriced bottle for $3.45.  I just received the Amazon shipping notification and I will be paying over $14 for this bottle.<br /><br />The honey dijon dressing is very good (great on a spinach salad with blueberries and pecans) but certainly not worth the $14.  Amazon fulfills some of the Walden Farms dressings - I wish they would add the honey dijon.<br /><br />So five stars for the dressing, and one star for the very unreasonable S&H costs ($7.98).

review/text: I tried this on a lark, curious what a zero-calorie zero-carb dressing might taste like, and was pleasantly surprised.  It's pretty good, very good for "free", and certainly adequate for eliminating the "dry and bland" problem of simple salads.  I agree with others that it's more vinegary sweet than a regular honey dijon.  I find myself reaching for it over other low-calorie low-carb options.

review/text: I'm going to be honest here, I was intrigued by the marketing, packaging and general assumption that this treat would at least somewhat taste like peanut butter, after all, I only give my dog the best. I consider myself a first line of defense of sorts for my dog. After purchasing this product, I was sitting in my car and my curiosity got the better of me. I tried one. It didn't taste bad, but it definitely didn't taste like peanut butter AT ALL. Zero peanut butter taste. How does a company get away with such blatant false advertisement like this. It's shocking, shocking I say.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, there is no peanut butter flavor at all. Why say it when it's not true?<br /><br />Dog still loves them though. But then again, the only thing he doesn't like is olives.

It says that it is low fat, but the ingredient list has no fat at all on it so it must be very low. The sodium, on the other hand is a bit higher than I like, but the fiber content is good. The taste is somewhat bland, but I'm not complaining. I get tastes out of the other foods I eat with it. It's a vegan product and has no added MSG or preservatives and is gluten free. A product like this should have great appeal to those who are on restricted diets, for whatever reason. Relatively pure foods are hard to find.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Different Kind of Pretzels
review/text: These fish-shaped pretzels actually taste better than I expected they would. Not overly salted, they do have a unique taste of their own yet retain mostly that classic pretzel taste. The small size of the pretzel snack is nice in that there are fewer crumbs encountered than with larger pretzel shapes that have to be broken or bitten into when eating.<br /><br />The package contains the usual glowing buzz words like: natural, goodness, no artificial preservatives, and baked.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed is "smiles" followed by unbleached, enriched wheat flour. One serving of  pieces has only  calories. Rarely do I limit myself to one serving so my intake of calories while snacking is considerably more. That's what happens when you snack right out of the bag instead of apportioning a reasonable amount before snacking.<br /><br />These would make a nice lunchtime snacks for the kids, especially in a packed lunch.

review/text: I just love these delicious little fish, and my grandchildren are very disappointed if I don't have some available when they come over. Buying these tasty treats in large bags is a wonderful way to make sure I will have some on hand for quite a while.
