review/summary: "F" for presentation
review/text: Yes, these are delicious.<br /><br />But when I got them, they showed up in an extremely battered envelope -so much so that the envelope was hanging open in two places- and inside, the almonds weren't packed with any sort of label, identifier, sticker, ANYTHING. Just a plain, unmarked sandwich baggie.<br /><br />One of the other people who reviewed this item complained that the seller didn't state that the product contained milk fat, so was the seller's solution to stop including nutritional information at all?  Can they do that? The almonds I received didn't list nutritional info, ingredients, allergy information, weight, serving size, or anything else that the FDA has standards for.  Not even a label that says what they are.<br /><br />Also, since the almonds arrived in such a piece of crap envelope with no packing material, a lot of them arrived broken.<br /><br />And since I ordered these as a gift, I feel reeeally weird about presenting someone with an unmarked baggie of broken brown things.

review/summary: Great taste, good amount.
review/text: I've never ordered this type of product online before so I had a few reservations and concern for the quality. Eventually, however I decided to go ahead and I am very glad I did. The product arrived with a cool pack to avoid the chocolate from melting, and sure enough every single piece of candy was in perfect condition. The almonds had a great taste, and the chocolate was top quality. My only regret is that they do not offer a milk chocolate variety here on amazon(in 1lb bag). Too bad.<br /><br />If you like almonds, and dark chocolate I definitely recommend buying from Superior nut Company.

It has a VERY strong sage flavor, and I suppose that is good, but it is a little off-putting, so I either add a green tea bag when I brew, or, which is even better, add one bag to a pitcher full of ICED TEA, which I make all summer with at least six tea bags - green, ginger, fenugreek and different herbals (I especially like Davidson's Hibiscus with Tulsi teabags which are absolutely delicious even on their own).

review/summary: Fine IF You're Looking for Tiny Raisins
review/text: I would not object if these had been labeled simply "currants" because Zante grapes are called currants in this country (the U.S.). However, Bob's Red Mill has unfortunately chosen to label these "black currants" which generally means Ribes nigrum. Luckily, I read the fine print at the last minute. Zante raisins (Vitis vinifera) are fine as raisins go, but they are not the antioxidant powerhouses that real currants are, and they do not have the complex flavor that the rest of the world associates with black currants. Bob's Red Mill "black currants" are probably better than most Zante raisins, but the label is misleading and it misrepresents the product. Bad call, Bob. I expect better from you.

review/summary: Health benefits are those of grapes, not black currants
review/text: If you're looking, as I was, for the type of black currants that researchers have found are higher in antioxidants than grapes and may have powerful health benefits, look elsewhere.  It's not so much that the manufacturer is being dishonest as that "black currant" has come to mean "Zante currant" in the U.S.  What researchers studied was the Ribes nigrum species; the common name "black currant" here is just going to mislead you into buying small raisins.  Ribes nigrum is a berry that grows on bushes, while grapes are unrelated and grow on vines.<br /><br />After buying these and finding they tasted a lot like raisins (I should have read the earlier reviews), I did some research in Wikipedia and on the web and finally found a source of real black currants, which I've just ordered.  Amazon has some products that list Ribes nigrum as an ingredient, but doesn't seem to carry the berries, just seed oil, cosmetics, and powders.

I decided to give these a try, and found them to be like the boxed Zante currants in the store... there's nothing wrong with those, but they are more like tiny raisins (as are these).  I'll use them, but am still looking for the true black currant taste that I love in the European black currant products.

review/text: LKK is a pretty good brand for most anything they sell. (As are "Healthy Boy" and "Asia Best.") However, you might want to try the LKK oyster sauce that has "No MSG" printed on the label. LKK sauces are assertive. And oysters are the third or fourth down the ingredients list--after water, sugar, and so on. You might also try an excellent Thai oyster sauce. It features oysters as the main ingredient, first on the list, and a full 30% of the total contents! Its English brand name is Maekrua and the label features a healthy looking woman against a blue background pouring the sauce into a giant wok. A more subtle sauce than most, but also more meaty (as opposed to sweet or salty). Maekrua's motto is "Diversity and Refinement" which, although certainly oxymoronic, is a noble ideal.

review/summary: BEST TASTING but CONTAINS MSG, and is expensive
review/text: Lee Kum Kee Premium Oyster Sauce is considered to be the best tasting oyster sauce by far (by industry insiders and consumers). This is the original, truly. The Lee family literally invented oyster sauce. Grandpa Lee was making oyster soup and accidentally cooked it down to a thick liquid and that's how it was invented (its main ingredient is concentrated slow cooked oysters). Oyster sauce is a must-have condiment for cooking nearly every one of today's Chinese & Cantonese food dishes (that have sauce) and for a good reason. It imparts a unique flavor that can't be imitated by any other flavoring or condiment. Not sure what they used before this was invented more than 120 years ago, but we're sure glad they use it now.<br /><br />Be careful when purchasing, if you want this exact sauce. Lee Kum Kee makes at least 9 or 10 types of oyster sauce, but this is the best one they make, their "premium" oyster sauce. Still, I wonder why it's so expensive, since they have the power to buy oysters relatively cheaply by the millions and have already perfected the way it's made, getting it down to a science that for them is surely simple to do since they've been doing it for so long. Why so expensive. I imagine they charge so much because they can, since they have such a great rep for the best flavor.<br /><br />They make a darn good Hoisin sauce too, plus over 200 other types of sauces.<br /><br />The main headquarters of Lee Kum Kee is located in Hong Kong and has production bases in Xinhui, Huangpu, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Los Angeles. So those customers in America who don't like to buy imports, not to worry, chances are if you buy from a store in America you're getting the product that was made right here in California.<br /><br />Having said all that, it looses one star for having MSG in its ingredients. I'm also not happy that the price is so high (higher than other brands, no matter where you buy it). I always wonder, how would it taste without the MSG and caramel color. The color is naturally brown, so I don't see why coloring is needed. And salt is already a great flavor enhancer so I wonder why add MSG. I'm still searching for a great tasting oyster sauce with no MSG (and not so expensive) but haven't found one yet. When I do I'll be sure to post that info here for you all.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Oyster Extractives, Sugar, Water, Monosodium Glutamate As A Flavor Enhancer, Salt, Modified Corn Starch, Wheat Flour, Caramel Color.<br /><br />Learn about MSG and how many believe it is bad for your health:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0929173252">Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0929173309">In Bad Taste: The MSG Symptom Complex</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1467953202">The Natural Diet: Simple Nutritional Advice For Optimal Health In The Modern World</a>

review/summary: Great Kona!
review/text: Not as good as fresh ground, but this is the best K-Cup I've had.  Kona is definitely a treat, though I may grind my own and make my own K-Cup in future.<br /><br />If you don't like Kona, I wouldn't spend the money.  There are lots of blends out there that work.<br /><br />Service and shipping were very acceptable.

review/summary: Just as good as from-scratch PB cookies!
review/text: Love love love love the pb cookies this mix makes.  In our family, we always make them as peanut butter blossoms, rolled in sugar before baking, and then with a hershey kiss placed in the center of the cookie right after they come out of the oven.  (Tip: as the kiss starts melting after a minute or two, gently push the kiss down.... this makes the entire kiss come into contact with the hot cookie.  This way, the kiss will soften into a puddle of chocolate, and will stick better to the cookie, instead of popping off as you move the cookies around.)<br /><br />I'm eating these pb blossoms as we speak!<br /><br />To say how good they are, I made these for a homeowner's association meeting a few years ago, and the president of the association disliked me quite a bit (I tore up part of my front lawn to plant a flower garden without getting his permission in writing first.... flower planting rebel that I am!).  However, he devoured these cookies, raving about how good they were and that I should start a bakery!  Of course, I told him I made them from scratch.  ^_^<br /><br />Another tip, the package gives a time range for how long you should bake these, and in my personal experience living in a place that had incredibly dry air in the cold winter, I baked these cookies on the low end of that time range.  If I didn't, they stood a greater chance of drying out when I placed them out for company.  The cookies I'm eating right now, my sister baked them for the longer time listed in the time range, but we now live in a damp, rainy winter kind of place, and they didn't dry out.  Of course, this might be simply due to differences in ovens, but I thought I'd throw my humidity speculation out there for you, just in case.<br /><br />BTW, amazon has the *best* price on these!  I normally pay about $3.50 a package at my local grocery store.

review/summary: Delicious treat for cookie lovers!
review/text: This cookie mix is very tasty and versatile!  I have used almost all of the varieties of these and they are consistent, quick, and can be used in cookies and bars.  Our favorite with this package is to mix up the dough, press it into a 9 x 13 inch pan, bake for 18 minutes.  Melt 1 bag (2 cups) of chocolate chips and spread them over the top of the peanut butter bars.  Chill in the refrigerator for about an hour and you have a quick treat to take anywhere.  M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M!

review/summary: Surprised by How Good These Are....and EASY
review/text: I bought a few packages of this mix because I'm just burnt out on domesticity lately - hardly surprising since it's just after the holidays.<br /><br />I have to say I was totally surprised by how good these are. I just never expected that from a mix. They were super easy to make too and I think they make exactly the right amount. They were all gone long before we got tired of them or before they could get stale.<br /><br />We don't like crispy cookies and I thought the batter was a little sticky (the stickier the batter, the crispier the cookie) so I chilled the dough just a bit and used my cookie scoop to make uniform cookies. I also used my insulated baking sheets and these turned out perfect!<br /><br />I experimented a little with these the second time I made them and added just a little flour and chilled the dough thoroughly. Then I rolled it out, cut it into circles and put a dollop of homemade raspberry jam in the center of a circle, topped with another circle of the dough (the second circle I cut a couple of small slits in prior to placing it on top), sealed the edges and baked that way, again on insulated baking sheets. My husband thought they were excellent!<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more of this mix in the future.

review/summary: Delicious jerky!
review/text: I bought a few flavors of Buffalo Bills jerky based on positive reviews that I saw here on Amazon.  As a fan of spicy foods, I immediately chose the spicy jerky as one of the flavors to try.  It is very delicious and tender, with just the right amount of heat (not too mild and not so spicy that you feel like your tongue might melt either).  I highly recommend this jerky to anyone considering purchasing it, and can't wait to purchase some more myself soon!

review/summary: A Consistent Tasty Treat
review/text: We've been buying from Choo Choo Snacks(Buffalo Bills) for almost 2 years now.  No matter where I've been or what I'm doing, this is some tasty goodness.  It's moist, easy to chew, with peppers on the beef visible through the bag!  So far, I've tried all variations of the Country Cut.  Barbecue and Teriyaki are sweet and true to their flavors.  Honey Pepper is fairly sweet with that black pepper kick all over it.  Mild is exactly as it says, mild(it would be like Spicy with no spicy hehe).  Chipotle Habanero, though, is a whole different story.  It is VERY spicy and the burn will stay in your mouth for a while longer as expected so be careful.  Compared to buying Jack Link's for half the price(and almost half the flavor IMO), this is really good deal.

review/summary: Best jerky I've found
review/text: I can't speak for all of Buffalo Bill's jerky products, but the "Country Cut" jerky is simply wonderful.  My favorite flavor is the Spicy, which has an honest to goodness heat factor, enough to satisfy any "chilehead".  Apparently, the "country cut" jerky style signifies that it is moister than the rest of BB's offerings, and I'm all for that.  Moist, yes, with a marvelous mouthfeel, cut into succulent strips and hunks.  Another winner is the Honey Pepper flavor, which masterfully mates sweetness and heat in a winning combination.  Teriyaki is O.K., but it's never been a favorite of mine, so my opinion is biased in that arena.  I was buying World Kitchens jerky (at ten or so dollars a pound it's probably the best jerky bargain out there), but Buffalo Bill's is, in my opinion, far superior.  Just about double the price of World Kitchens (an eight ounce bag is about twelve dollars), but well worth it.  I would recommend only buying the large eight ounce bags (BB's also offers two smaller sizes), because, if you're like me, you'll munch through this stuff quick.

review/summary: I only see 3 stars tonight...
review/text: I found the reviews on here to be completely misleading.<br /><br />Let me put this simply...<br /><br />This jerky is mediocre at best. The meat is very moist and has a lot of flavor but is overly sweet and salty, almost as if they drenched this in syrup and soy sauce before cooking it. The name Spicy Country should be changed to Mild Country. The slices are too thick and look like boba straws. I also wouldn't recommend it if you prefer your jerky a little more chewier.<br /><br />Positive side: $15 for jerky might be steep but 8 oz is a lot and it's definitely worth the price.<br /><br />It's good jerky, but not the best.<br /><br />If you're looking for some good jerky. Try Jack Links Peppered. It's one of the best jerky's I've had and it's available at your local grocery store.<br /><br />If you're ever in Gilroy, CA, visit the Garlic Shoppe. BEST beef jerky I ever had. Its by the cashier in the clear box, get a bag and enjoy : )<br /><br />Cheers

review/summary: Milder than most of the bold flavors with a slight  zing of lime citrus flavor!
review/text: These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!

review/summary: Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?
review/text: These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. "BOLD" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure!

review/summary: Not habanero-y at all, but still insanely addicting
review/text: The heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help. These are not like that. Only occasionally will you get a little kick. It's actually mostly tangy and tomato-y. The dusting of flavoring on the outside of the nuts will coat your fingers in an orange film.<br /><br />Satisfyingly crunchy and tangy, it's really hard to stop eating these. Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving. High in Vitamin E (35%) and magnesium (20%). This 1 pound bag (x3 bags) is a great deal compared to buying the 6 oz tins at the store, however, when my local Walgreens has buy 1 get 1, the price drops to about $0.35/oz.<br /><br />Blue Diamond makes about 8 other flavors that I know of. My favorites are the Soy Wasabi, Honey Roasted, Smokehouse, Dijon Mustard.

review/summary: Great flavor
review/text: I'm a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the "bold" flavors.<br /><br />The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that says the tartness of the lime flavor is just enough to bring out the chili flavor. Its a nice balance.<br /><br />I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom.

review/summary: Different and tasty!
review/text: When I first tried these tasty almonds, I was amazed at the great marriage of flavor. Has the kick of wasabi, and the sweet taste of roasted almonds. The first one is an eye opener each time even after you have had them many times. Bold and fun! If you like sushi, and you enjoy the taste of wasabi, these are for you.

review/summary: Best flavor and best price of any Blue Diamond almonds!
review/text: The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting. They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering. Compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable.

review/text: I was concerned that these might be too hot, 'Habanero', but the heat is perfect as is the flavor... they are bold, if you like stuff plain--these are not for you... but if you like a robust flavor, a definite must!  Took some to the office and my office is all addicted by these now, you can't eat just one.  From a texture perspective, they are perfectly roasted - not chewy and not powdery, they are crisp.  I'm on a Paleolithic 'Paleo' diet and nuts like these are okay for me to eat - so they make a great treat.  I've gone through 7 bags in 3 months (sharing, of course)... I definitely recommend.

review/summary: Highly addictive! Great with beer
review/text: I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!

review/text: Hello everyone, I just had to write a review for these Wasabi and Soy Sauce flavored Blue Diamond Almonds, because I enjoy them sooooooo much! I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond. The flavor is fantastic, as it is spicy but not so much to bring tears to your eyes. Also, the price of this product is great as well. Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving. Treat yourself to these awesome almonds today!

review/summary: The best almond flavor out there. How could something so delish be so good for you?
review/text: The "Jalapeno Smokehouse" flavor is the best flavor in the Blue Diamond "BOLD" series, hands down. Unlike some of the other flavors, this one really tastes like what it's supposed to taste like -- that is to say, smoky jalapeno peppers. To my jaded taste buds, the pepper spice is fairly mild, but I imagine most people find it packs quite a kick. It's a good thing these huge, perfectly roasted nuts are great for you, because I eat them constantly. Hey, my HDL cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol) has actually risen as I've gotten older. I like to think it's partly because of these luscious babies. Dr Jeddy prescribes a handful every day!

review/text: I'm addicted to Blue Diamond almonds. I've tried all the flavors -- and this was the last one I tried. I love salt, I love vinegar, and I love salt-and-vinegar potato chips, so how could I lose with these?<br /><br />Well, I'm just not that into them. The flavor's great and the almonds are fresh, but somehow the texture just fails. The almonds just seem... soggy. They don't have that wonderful crunch that the other Blue Diamond flavors have. And that flattens out the whole experience of eating them. I've eaten about 10 bags so far, and they all have the same lackluster texture.<br /><br />Oh well. Guess even my ol' reliable Blue Diamond can't hit it out of the park every time.

The cost is also lower than in local stores, but you can buy the larger bags cheaper (per oz) from some Walmarts if you can find them.<br /><br />Almonds are supposed to be appetite suppressants, but for me it's usually because I ate an entire can of them and am not hungry any more.

review/summary: Great Low Carb snack to go!!
review/text: Before we switched to eating low carb, we used to LOVE a nice big bag of chips.  I was missing those zesty salty crunchy snacks, until we found these delicious almonds!  I have tried all of the flavors and love them all, but these are my current favorite.  I like the snack size packs as a reminder that I have had enough since I can never stop eating them (just like potato chips, no one can eat just one).  A whole package is only  8 grams of carbs (only 4 grams of net carbs if you are an Atkins dieter).  These almonds have a nice crisp texture (even better if you put them in the refrigerator for a bit) and the seasoning is evenly distributed.  Not to strong, but also not too weak that it gets lost on the almonds. A package of 12 only lasted about a week in our home, back to order more.

review/text: Not generally a big fan of wasabi or of almonds, but somehow find these particular wasabi and soy sauce almonds to be a healthy addiction. My doctor recommended almonds as an excellent low-carb, high protein, high fiber snack with heart healthy fat and this flavor is great to meet that suggestion while providing a nice savory and spicy snack with a little salty crunch.  A little bit spicy but not too much (I don't tolerate really spice foods well).  I tried the smokehouse flavor by the same brand and didn't like it, but I could live on these wasabi and soy sauce almonds. The soy sauce flavor is hardly noticeable but just nicely tones down the heat of the wasabi.

review/summary: Soooo addicting
review/text: I've been participating in Weight Watchers for the last couple months (doing well).  I like to have a healthy snack at work mid-afternoon so I bought a bag of these at the grocery store.  They are so good I can't stop at 23 (a serving size).  I am not going to buy these again until I'm at my goal because I can't stop eating them.  They are quite salty so if you are trying to control your sodium, beware.  They are not as "hot" as wasabi peas, a more gentle kick.  I highly recommend them. Very savory.

review/summary: I'm an addict!  Great for low carb
review/text: These are the tastiest of all the Blue Diamond flavors out there, in my opinion!  Just the right combination of vinegar sourness and salty goodness.<br /><br />Plus they're a very healthy low-carb snack.  The tin is just the right size, and the lid keeps them fresh for a few weeks (not that they tend to last that long!)

review/summary: Limey
review/text: I really enjoy the Jalapeno flavor.  The Wasabi flavor was just a step behind that.  But this lime and chili flavor...I think I would only enjoy it with a beer.  The lime flavor is just way to intense.  I will not be ordering this flavor again.

review/summary: Best Nuts Ever
review/text: I absolutely love these nuts! I can't find them where I live so I will continue to order these from Amazon. They are well worth the price.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: Better tasting then just about any potato chip and tons healthier too, especially for low carb diets. These things are just amazing. The lime and chili flavors are equally bold and complement the flavor of the almond quite nicely. Highly recommended.  They have some other flavors that may be worth trying too.

review/summary: Yum
review/text: Eaten alone these flavored almonds are a bit overpowering (pretty tart, but I love 'em). However, if you put them in a large container with other flavored nuts, such as lime 'n chili, along with raw almonds, cashews, walnuts whatever, the spices are spread among all the other nuts. A great snack. It was also cheaper and easier to get them through Amazon than to run all over town trying to find a store that carries the flavors I want.

review/text: I could live off of these things, they are soooo good!  I usually get mine at the supermarket, but this 6-pack deal is a great idea for addicts like myself.  I guess the wasabi flavor is a bit weak, but that's perfect for me because although I love the flavor of horseraddish, it destroys my sinuses! lol

review/summary: Delicious AND Nutritious
review/text: These have a great combination of salt and vinegar which makes neither aspect overwhelming. They are insanely addictive and they go well with dried fruits like raisins to give some contrast to the salt. They are also high in fiber which makes up for their fat content to some extent.

review/summary: Zesty Deliciousness in a Can
review/text: I love these.  They have exactly the right amount of spice/flavoring (which is probably too much) and I used to buy the 1.5oz package daily with lunch, but buying them in bulk makes so much more sense.  Yum!  The empty cans are good for storing loose hardware and small things around the house.

review/summary: so yummy
review/text: Found these by accident - they are so tasty. Very hard to find in local grocery stores, so I was happy to find them on Amazon.com.  Will probably be ordering more.<br /><br />4/2/11 - I have since bought 3 more cases. I took some to work and everyone wanted to know where I got them. They asked me to sell them some when I get another shipment.

review/summary: Great Flavored Almonds, Hard to Get
review/text: This particular flavor of Blue Diamond almonds generally doesn't show up in grocery stores in this size cans. The occasional quick shop/gas station may carry them in the small bags. I travel and I look every time. It may not be everybody's favorite, but I'm sure glad I can get them in bulk.

review/summary: LOOOOVE these almonds!
review/text: I am so thrilled to find these on Amazon! I don't know why it didn't occur to me to look earlier. I love salt and vinegar potato chips and these definitely hit the same flavor spot. But it's a much healthier alternative. They are still high in fat, as all nuts are, so eating a whole can in one sitting is probably not the thing to do. But a handful in the afternoon really takes care of my salt craving, the bold vinegar flavor makes a little go a long way and I'm getting some good nutrients too. As others mentioned, of all the "bold" flavors, this seems to be the one that is hardest to find in stores. Thank you, Amazon!

review/summary: Big hit!!!
review/text: My husband absolutely loves these.  He's self-employed and spends alot of time on the road - takes apples and these nuts with him.  He's even given them away at the jobsites and the guys all love them.  Great product and the free shipping is a real plus!
