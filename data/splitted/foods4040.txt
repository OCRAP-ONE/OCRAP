review/summary: Disgusting!!
review/text: What a terrible dinner.  I just wasted 2 pounds of ground chuck from the butcher shop and a box of organic quinoa pasta.  If you would like to experience the taste of this sauce, there's no need to buy it.  Just take the bottle of lemon juice from the refrigerator and drink straight from the bottle!!  I make my own homemade sauce from fresh tomatoes often.  This sauce doesn't taste like there is even tomatoes in it.  As far as I'm concerned between the beef, pasta and fresh sauted veggies I put into it, it ended up wasting me around $20 and forced my family to quick scrounge for a fast dinner.  It hardly tasted like food!!

review/text: We tried this sauce because it said no sodium added. When I tasted it I felt like I was drinking lemon juice. It was very sour and super watery. I will not buy it again. Going back to regular stuff and not taking chances with organic items anymore.

review/text: These Nonni's Biscotti "Turtle Pecan" are good tasting, somewhat sweet and have 110 calories each. My wife found these at local specialty store and they have quickly become a favorite with my wife and teen son when we sit down for coffee or tea, but, being a purist, I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7YO2M">Nonni's Biscotti, Originali, 8-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. The flavors are balanced but there are occasional chewy blobs encountered.<br /><br />I do like that the individual wrapped "cookies" keeps them fresh even after the box is opened.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Not much flavor, pricey and packaging is hard to open
review/text: Japanese green tea has a cleaner, grassier flavor than the Chinese variety.  You don't get as much tea for the money with this one as the less expensive brands, and I find the flavor to be too subtle.  But after reading about the potential dangers of fluoride in green teas, especially the non-organic and Chinese varieties, I will try to stay with this kind, which is said to have a lower level of the carcinogen.  The Tazo China Green Tips green tea has a stronger flavor I prefer, but is said to have a high(er) level of fluoride.  I figure going organic AND Japanese Sencha will reduce my exposure to a degree.  The plastic cover on each teabag is hard to tear without also ripping the delicate bag inside.  Perhaps they should look at the way other brands encase their bags.  The company could reduce the amount of packaging as well by reducing the size of the outer box, which is bigger than it really needs to be.<br /><br />Addendum: After a couple of months of trying this tea, I've knocked off two stars.  I find this one just lacks flavor, and I've wasted about a half-dozen bags that tore open while I tried to open the wrapper, no matter how careful I was.  You should be able to tear open the wrappers, but even if I cut them open, some bags were adhered to the inside of their wrapper and tore open when pulled out. The wrappers are tough plastic and the bags are very delicate. And the strings come off easily, especially while steeping in hot water.  We won't be buying it again.

review/text: I don't claim to be a tea connoisseur but I really do like this tea.  It is has a smooth taste.  I prefer to make iced green tea than hot.  I have only tried two other brands, one being Lipton, and I like this one the best so far. It is also a pretty good deal for the quality you get.  You can really see the hearty dark green tea leaf in the bag after brewing this tea. Recommended.

Like skacleve, "I find this one just lacks flavor".  I've been through almost four 18-count boxes, and like skacleve, "I've wasted [over a dozen] bags that tore open while I tried to open the wrapper, no matter how careful I was. You should be able to tear open the wrappers, but even if I cut them open, some bags were adhered to the inside of their wrapper and tore open when pulled out.

review/text: This House Blend is a decent breakfast blend and leans more to the medium side than the bold side of coffee.

Having used Keurig pots since they first came out a decade ago (?) and having tried about 80 flavors, I'm going to put this coffee right up in the top 10.  I prefer it's Italian brother slightly but find this coffee to be both bold enough for my tastes and smooth enough for my partner's taste.  We have a house full of guests now and the carousel has dozens of different coffees on it but the Barista is the one I keep having to refill.<br /><br />But it's not good enough to cost $1 a cup.<br /><br />8/12 - found them for $.60 a k-cup (box of 96).

review/summary: Make Your Own Vanilla Syrup
review/text: I bought these vanilla beans in 2007 and five years later they still made a delicious vanilla syrup. I've used them in other recipes although I found them difficult to open since they seem to dry out a bit. When I make vanilla syrup all I do is cut the beans into half inch pieces. To make a syrup bring two cups water and two cups granulated sugar to a boil. Add in eight cut up vanilla beans. When boiling lower heat so that the syrup is still rolling but more like a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes. You want a bit of the water to evaporate. Then turn off the heat and cover the syrup. Leave it overnight so more vanilla is infused into the syrup. Then strain it through cheesecloth and pour it into a prepared bottle. I use an old vanilla syrup bottle. When you make your own syrup you don't have to worry about preservatives and it tastes way better. You can then drizzle your homemade syrup over fresh fruit or put it in your coffee. Don't expect the syrup to be clear however. The vanilla beans do color the syrup a bit.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Great Mustard, Lousy Container.
review/text: I'm a mustard fan, Heinz (The kind that could be found in restaurants in glass bottles called "pourable" and now Annie's.) The yellow mustard is heavy, thick  and richly flavored. The vinegar used is bright and snappy.  My only hesitation is their plastic container. It doesn't drain well and even when left to stand upside down for days won't flow to the mouth of the container.  It's badly designed for the thickness of their product and thus, maybe a quarter of its contents is unusable.<br /><br />I'm conducting an experiment currently . By measuring the weight of a full container, the weight of  the container when it won't give any more product and the weight of the container rinsed clean, I should be able to calculate exactly how much is lost due to the bottle not being designed appropriately. I'll report back when completed. Probably seems to most to be a ridiculous activity but at my age we take pleasure where we can find it. I'll report back when completed.<br /><br />Anyway for those that like mustard  this is a solid tasty mustard, maybe the best I've had of the Yellow mustard type.  If you like a hearty bright mustard try it.

review/text: My toddler loved the flavor of these. I like the price and the fact that Amazon delivered them to my door. HOWEVER, we ordered several Plum Tots with Quinoa flavors. For some reason, my daughter seemed to have digestive issues (runny stools and vomiting) with them. Not sure if it was the product or her system but I can tell you that she eats fresh bananas, home cooked rice and Quinoa without a problem. We threw the rest of the Plum Tots products in the trash once we figured out what was happening. Haven't purchased a Plum Tots product since.

review/summary: Delicious Chai
review/text: *****<br />This chai tea contains fair trade certified and organic assam black tea, organic cinnamon, organic anise, and organic cardamom. I enjoy a strong chai and all of these spices, so I typically leave the tea bag in my tea, not ever removing it. Numi tea does not get bitter when you do this. It might take me a half hour to drink the tea, but it still tastes wonderful and very strong, so this works for me.<br /><br />All of Numi's teas are the absolute best quality, using premium organic teas and herbs and real fruits, flowers, and spices (as opposed to "natural" flavors or fragrances). They are also gluten-free. Numi uses natural biodegradable filter-paper tea bags, not GMO corn or plastic silky bags. Their boxes are recyclable and are printed with soy-based inks. From beginning to end, this is a tea that exceeds all of my expectations.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I love Numi's Golden Chai, so I ordered their Holiday Chai to try for the holidays and to add to Christmas gift bags. The first cup I brewed, I steeped the bag as I usually would and it was a little light for my taste. So the next cup I let it steep about a minute longer and it was great. Overall I would still say the spices might be a little lighter than the Golden Chai.  But it's still a very tasty tea.  You can't go wrong with Numi tea. Love that they are all organic and fair trade.

Still, these confections are above average; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.<p>Anyone receiving a box of See's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made.

review/summary: The BEST candy EVER!!!
review/text: I've tried the rest, but this is the BEST!<br /><br />I've been eating See's candies since I was just a kid!  Easter was one of my favorite holidays, because my mom would order See's large easter eggs, we would get to pick our favorite filling, Chocolate or Chocolate Walnut, then we'd get a medium chocolate egg, I would always choose the Bordeaux (by far the best flavored candy See's sells), you could get the divinity if you liked that.  The buttercream is always a huge favorite at our house.  You have your choice of Dark or Milk chocolate. Choose your own liking!  I prefer Milk chocolate.  Another of my favorites is California Brittle.  Also, the Vanilla Nut Carmel (no chocolate on this one), but very tasty!<br /><br />Just remember the Assorted premade box doesn't always have the best picks in it.  If you like nuts and chews, that's one of the better choices.  I prefer to go down to See's and select my own mix!  Pecan turtles--just melt in your mouth.  Try the truffles if you like!<br /><br />Never did like Godiva or Fanny Farmer, once in awhile I could take a piece of Helen Grace or Lindt, but they never live up to my standards.<br />See's is the perfect candy and it makes the perfect gift for family, friends, co-workers, neighbors, service company's and the postal person.  Don't cross anyone off your list until you surprise them with a gift of See's candy for the Holidays.

When they arrived they were completely melted and had reformed in the box.  The recipient called to say what had happened.  A replacement box was sent a week later.  We don't know who to blame for the delay in shipping or for the manner in which it was shipped.

review/summary: PERFECT!!!! (and yes, I HAVE tried it)
review/text: Let ME preface MY review by saying that I actually HAVE tried it and it is well worth the price! The grind is perfect for my Solofill and tastes better than any K-cup I've ever used. But here's something I do not get at all! Did that reviewer really just say "It's a lot cheaper to continue using my Solofill cup to scoop some coffee out of the can"?  I don't get it... the logic I mean. I buy a 2 liter bottle of soda when there's a birthday party or office party, picnic, etc. I KNOW that the bottle will be gone and it's cheaper by the ounce. But that doesn't keep me from buying a 12 oz. can of the same brand of soda!!! Ounce for ounce a can of soda costs FIVE times as much as a 2 liter bottle.  But it doesn't take a coffee snob to figure out after a few days that the ground coffee in that can is losing its flavor the same way a bottle of coke loses its fizz after a few days. If you don't want to spend money on Ekojava coffee packets, then at least buy whole bean coffee and grind it as you use it.<br /><br />But then I suppose someone would say "Why not just buy K-cups then?". Good question - easy answer (in my world anyway).<br /><br />These little sticks of coffee that are ground nicely, weighed out perfectly (instead of the freaking mess you make scooping coffee out of a can or bag), and FRESH! So far, sounds like a K-cup. BUT... I use other things to brew coffee other than a Keurig. The packets work in the Melitta I have in my office. I gave a handful of sticks to my neighbor who tried it in his drip coffeemaker. After trying it a few times, he found that one packet in a drip coffeemaker using a paper filter makes 5 cups of awesome drip coffee! Try that with a K-cup! AND JUST out of curiosity, I stopped by a very cool coffee shop in Boise, Idaho (Salt Tears... VERY cool place!) They have a pour over bar and use the Coava Kone filters instead of paper. I asked him if I could use my coffee packet instead of there DOMA coffee (one of a few roasters in Idaho I would recommend). The water was at 206 degrees and he expertly poured about a third of the water in. The coffee began to de-gas (yeah... ain't gonna happen with ground coffee from a can) and then finished off the pour and we waited. We were both pretty blown away. It was awesome.<br /><br />Bottom line? Not sure I'd recommend this to people who are happy with coffee from a can. And I am NOT knocking those who do. My father scooped Folgers from a can when I was a kid and for years I thought that was the epitome of great coffee (but then, I also used to think hamburger was the highest quality beef). But I confess... that sounds a bit condescending and I realize that many people truly enjoy simple store brand ground coffee in their Keurig. My point it, just because you own a Keurig and a Solofill, doesn't qualify you to write a review for something you've never even tried. Dude... At least try something before you review it. C'mon... really? Okay, I sound like a snob. But I guess that's my point. If you are happy with ground coffee from a can, this probably doesn't make sense. If you are more discriminating than that, and you need something to take with you that is a high quality, one cup solution, is fresh, and you want to use it anywhere in almost anything, then heck yeah... this is a great buy!!!

review/text: These individual pre-measured coffee packs work great in the Solofill and ekobrew.<br />The Grind seems perfect and brewed a decent cup of coffee in my Keurig B70 on the 8oz cup size.<br />Getting coffee with the perfect grind to work in the solofill & ekobrew is a challenge unless you have a good burr grinder so this is a really convenient alternative.<br />I'm more of a dark roast extra bold Kcup drinker and this is a much lighter roast than I prefer.<br />The Flavor I would rate as average but nothing special.<br />reminded my of the average ground coffee you find on grocery store shelfs.<br />Amazon had it priced really low so I gave it a try and it serves its purpoes well at that price point.

review/summary: Looking for Bold FLAVOR?  Look Elsewhere.
review/text: This review is on the coffee itself, not the packaging or the EkoBrew concept itself.  If this were for the packaging and concept, it would be 5 stars.  These little suckers are convenient and work fabulously with the EkoBrew cup gizmo.  Even though I don't care for this blend of coffee, I'm glad I purchased it to get a manufacturer-provided example of the type of grind and proper amount of coffee to use in the EkoBrew cup.)<br /><br />This Honduras House Blend coffee is a medium-light roast coffee at best.  Weaker than anything you'd get at a restaurant or coffee shop, that's for sure.  It's not acidy or bitter at all, just not full-bodied or bold flavored.  I tend to use a heavy hand with my cream, and for this coffee only needed about half as much.  As a reference, I drink Newman's Own K-cups on a daily basis and find them to be a near-perfect cup of coffee.  I do prefer darker roasts like Green Mountain's Sumatra Reserve or Dark Magic.<br /><br />This isn't a *bad* roast, just a weak one.  I'm sure there are some people who would like this (maybe occasional coffee drinkers?) but no one in my house enjoyed it.

review/text: I ordered 3 different blends to try this coffee out. So far I've just tried the Honduras House Blend, and am very pleased. I've been rather partial to Green Mountain K-cups, but this EkoJava blend has even my favorite GM blend beat in the flavor department, in my opinion. It is not as convenient as K-cups in that, regardless of the "no mess" claim, it will always be easier to throw out a K-cup than to clean a filter. But it certainly isn't difficult, and for the superior flavor and the reduced waste, it's certainly worth it. I highly recommend it!

review/text: My husband and I don't have a Keurig but since we like going on 3 day trips a lot, we like the sticks. My husband drinks more than I do so I make a full 12 cup pot using just 2 sticks. It was PERFECT!!! Not weak but not too strong. So, I can get 150 cups out of a canister. I see they are now $10. Even better! Got my calculator out and... That comes out to LESS than 7 cents a cup! I'm sold!!! We got it for taking trips but it's good enough and inexpensive enough, we are buying this for home now. No grinding, stays fresh and tastes great. I have no idea how someone could give this just one start! He  (or she?) didn't even try it!

review/summary: A good alternative to high priced K cups -
review/text: My wife likes the French Roast, Honduran House Blend, West Coast Roast, Breakfast Blend, Sumatran, and then Donut Cafe in that order.  I prefer the Donut Cafe, Sumatran, French Roast, Breakfast Blend, West Coast, then Honduran.  They each have subtle differences and are a good alternative to more expensive Green Mountain (K-cups) varieties.  These tend to work better with the My K Cup (reusable filter) than Folgers or other regular coffees due to the finer grind and package size.  I paid $3.82 per 25 count container on my last order before the price went back up to $11.99 and would pay that again.  I don't think I would pay regular price however.

The coffee is a tad weaker than the k-cups I purchase (French Roast), but for $0.20/cup it is well worth the switch.  I am also pleased to have found a way to use my Keurig that does not produce as much waste as k-cups.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with this coffee, the ease of using it, and (most importantly) the price!

review/summary: great sauce - terrible bottle
review/text: First let me say this is a wonderful hot sauce.  Spicy, flavorful, a wonderful addition to soups, pizza, etc.  Nice smoky flavor you hope for in a chipotle sauce.  Bargain priced.<br /><br />The bottle design for this thick of a sauce, on the other hand, is an abomination, a work of the devil.  The sauce is typically as thick as ketchup and will only with extreme coaxing exit the long narrow neck of the bottle.  It does not matter how you shake it or where you tap it or how loudly you heap curses upon it.  Your neighbors will wonder what is going on.  The opening is narrow enough that a knife is of little help, which leaves a chopstick as an poor alternative.  And additional perversity is that the sauce will *leak* when I pack it in camping gear!  Perhaps you think I have gotten a lone bad bottle - nooooo, repeated testing and consumption has found the same problem in at least 8 bottles!  I must stop typing now to go reassure my coworkers in neighboring cubicles that I was just putting hot sauce on my pizza and not having a knock down drag out fight steel drum band.<br /><br />sauce = win<br />packaging = fail

review/text: I live in New York where you'd think Mexican hot sauces wouldn't be readily available.  And while it's true that Tabasco Chipotle Hot Sauce is easier to find than this brand, like the original Tabasco sauce, the Tabasco chipotle has too much vinegar and not enough smoky pepper flavor for my taste buds.  That's why I always have a bottle of Cholula (or Tapa Tio), which are red Mexican hot sauces, and a bottle of Bufalo Chipotle in my fridge.  Bufalo's smoky flavor is the best.

I did not hold out high hopes but this stuff gave me a very pleasant surprise!<br /><br />The smoky flavor of chipotles is the main star in this sauce of course, and has a lovely tangy/sweet balance.  This sauce is very versatile I have found, being good right out of the bottle with cheeze and crackers, or as a condiment with cooked meats.  The heat is rather mild, allowing you to get as much of the great flavor of this sauce onto your dishes as you wish.<br /><br />I highly recommend this sauce.

review/text: I ordered this chai so I would have something tasty to drink in the evenings during the cold winter months. If you've ever had a rooibos tea you know they are lighter than black teas. But they are still tasty and with Numi's delicious chai spices, this is a wonderful decaf tea to add to your collection. Not to mention it's organic and fair trade. Great tea from a great company!

review/summary: Everyone loves this gift
review/text: I sent several boxes out for Christmas presents and it's one of the only years I ever gotten feedback about my gifts. Everyone I sent it to loved it and reminisced about candy they used to buy when they were a kid. My aunt even said she took a picture of she and her friend wearing the wax lips.  We're talking about two people in their sixties! So it was definitely a big hit.

review/text: What they fail to mention to everyone is the fact that the candy is all for the decade it was created in. My first piece of candy was an orange tootsie roll. When I bit down I almost broke my teeth it was so rock hard. The product may have been better if it wasn't so old. I also discovered that the small box that I thought was stuffed to the top with candy has paper filler in the bottom. Most of this "hard to find" candy can be found at Walmart and various other places for much cheaper prices.

review/text: I was very disappointed in this candy.  As mentioned in many of the previous reviews, it was cheap penny candy, much of which can be bought at any store today.  I kind of expected that... I mean, they aren't going to produce old candy just for these packages, so they have to still be making them somewhere.<br /><br />What I was really disappointed in was the amount.  The total worth of the candy in the box was maybe $5.  The box was cute, but very tiny.  You would be better to do a little research and put together your own box, with 3-4 times the amount for the same money.

review/text: These Planters peanuts are quite good, but I ordered them without knowing that they contained more than just plain, dry roasted peanuts.  Although theere is no noticeable taste, these peanuts contain sugar, cornstarch, msg, paprika, garlic and onion powder, and other spices.  I have four jars of them and to be honest, I am enjoying eating them, but I would not order them again.  I do a lot of Asian cooking in which peanuts are used quite frequently and I thought I'd save time by not having to open the shells of peanuts bought in a bag, so I took a shortcut in ordering these and it was a mistake.

review/summary: Milder than most of the bold flavors with a slight  zing of lime citrus flavor!
review/text: These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!

review/summary: Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?
review/text: These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. "BOLD" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure!

The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away.<br /><br />This is a very good product and I recommend it to you!

They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!

review/text: I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I've never seen the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor at the local grocery store so when I saw them on Amazon I decided to buy them.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. This is right up there with my favorite flavors. It has just enough heat and jalapeno flavor with just a little bit of smoke. To me, these have almost as much heat as the Habanero flavor. Which isn't a bad thing. I like spicy.<br /><br />I would defiantly recommend these if you like the Bold line of Blue Diamond Almonds.

review/summary: Not habanero-y at all, but still insanely addicting
review/text: The heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help. These are not like that. Only occasionally will you get a little kick. It's actually mostly tangy and tomato-y. The dusting of flavoring on the outside of the nuts will coat your fingers in an orange film.<br /><br />Satisfyingly crunchy and tangy, it's really hard to stop eating these. Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving. High in Vitamin E (35%) and magnesium (20%). This 1 pound bag (x3 bags) is a great deal compared to buying the 6 oz tins at the store, however, when my local Walgreens has buy 1 get 1, the price drops to about $0.35/oz.<br /><br />Blue Diamond makes about 8 other flavors that I know of. My favorites are the Soy Wasabi, Honey Roasted, Smokehouse, Dijon Mustard.

Its a nice balance.<br /><br />I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

review/summary: Best flavor and best price of any Blue Diamond almonds!
review/text: The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting. They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering. Compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable.
