review/summary: USE CAUTION!
review/text: My boyfriend's cat has been eating this food for six years. When I switched my cat over to it, she developed a UTI and has been urinating all over the house. She also gained a ton of weight. Other reviews I have found online show that cat owners have had similar problems with their cats getting sick from eating this food. PLEASE use caution! This could make your cat ill. If your cat does eat this food, always keep an eye on him or her. I always thought male cats were more prone to UTIs and yet my female cat was sick. It cost me over $300 in vet bills from feeding her this food!

review/summary: My Cat Prefers this Purina Indoor Formula
review/text: When my cat was a kitten, he ate the Purina Kitten Chow until he was full-grown. At that point, I got him the blue bag of regular Purina Cat Chow, and this green bag of Indoor Formula Cat Chow, and offered him a choice. My cat is an indoor-outdoor cat, but not too active with medium-length hair--he looks a bit like he is part Selkirk Rex. Well, he chose this green bag formula! My cat won't eat any canned cat food or meat, but he loves this cat chow, and he also likes cheese and milk. To vary his diet, I sometimes moisten this dry food with a bit of water and add a pinch of Brewer's Yeast flakes. I also use goat cheese and goat milk for treats. (I also give him a bit of Hairball remedy now and then, sometimes he eats that, and other times I have to put it on his paw so he will lick it off. I met two other ladies while shopping who say their cats prefer this Purina Indoor Formula Cat Chow.)

review/summary: Our Beloved Cat Enjoys This Food and is Prospering!
review/text: We have used Purina Cat Food for our cats for decades with complete satisfaction. I'm truly amazed and puzzled by the bad results some of the other reviewers have been experiencing.<br /><br />We shifted to the indoor formula several months ago because we do not let our cat outside. We had been giving her the regular Cat Chow but she seemed disposed toward eating the living plants we had in the house so we hoped the indoor formula would help relieve this tendency on her part.<br /><br />Since we shifted over she has seemed to enjoy her food and has exhibited no adverse effects that we have observed; again I am really puzzled by the results some of the other reviewers have gotten. We still keep a little Cat Chow around and will give her some for variety's sake.<br /><br />To complete an earlier thought on eating plants, the indoor formula didn't seem to make a difference so we've moved the living plants outside.<br /><br />If anything changes I'll update this review and in the meantime I wish the best for the cats with the problems!

review/summary: Not bad, if you can stand the smell!
review/text: I grabbed a bag of this when it went on sale at the local market and, although one of my cats really likes it, I can't stand the smell!  Honestly, it smells like horse doo.  Whenever she jumps in my lap after eating this stuff, it about makes me gag!  It has to be the strangest smelling cat food I've ever used, which is why I wanted to write this review.  Just thought it was rather strange. I don't plan on buying it again because of that - the smell is Blech!  It isn't her favorite food, but it's tolerable, especially if mixed with a little meat.  The protein content isn't as high, only 30% because it's for the indoor cat.  I would recommend it for that reason because it does help with the weight factor. Just be careful,your nose will have to be made of steel to get past the smell!

review/summary: I devour these food morsels!
review/text: When it's time for my evening meal, I often enjoy these tasty dry grains. This specialized indoor formula, made just for me because I am the most important being on earth, keeps me fit and healthy by reducing my fat intake. If I'm awake when Nathan get's home, I come rocketing into the kitchen to get my scoop of Purina Cat Chow. Sometimes I'm so hungry I can't contain myself and eat my food in a manner that is, uh, well let's just say it's not always dignified.<br /><br />Sometimes I wish that there were a few more pounds of food in that bag, as I have to send Nathan out to get me more on bi-weekly basis. That's ok though, as he is here to serve me. I've been pestering him to write this review for a while now, and it's good to know that other supreme beings like myself might benefit from my thoughts.<br /><br />If you, like me, enjoy these tasty grains, you might also like to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JUPOS">Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold Savory Chicken and Turkey Formula</a>.<br /><br />Oliver<br />Expert Cat Food Reviewer

review/summary: Best Salt Ever
review/text: I tried this salt in a sampler of eight, and this one was so much better than the others that I immediately looked for it on line. I know; salt is salt is salt, right?  But this one will change your mind.  The taste and texture are unmistakable.  The salt looks like snow crystals, peach-colored from the minerals in the water from which it's harvested, and the flakes melt like ice shavings on the tongue, leaving a bright, clear taste that's addictive.  As a replacement for salt in recipes, it's expensive; but it's a great substitute for table salt -- not just because it feels like a guilty pleasure, but because I wind up using much less of it to get the equivalent level of salinity -- with far more crunch and character.

review/summary: A Permanent Replacement to Other Candies in our House
review/text: I decided to try these in the hopes of finding a good organic and sugarless option.  These are wonderful!  I tried both the Pomegranate and Cherry flavors, and like them both.  Instead of sugar, these are sweetened with cane juice.  This adds a very slight flavor note, which enhances the appeal, giving these a bit more complexity and interest than the typical sugary-sweet hard candies.  The fruit flavor is definitely predominant and comes through loud and clear.  These last a long time, don't burn the roof of my mouth (like some hard candies do), and don't seem to get soft and sticky after residing in my purse for a while, like most hard candies do.  These are a standard item in my household now!

review/text: From my wife Sarah: I see the other reviewers saying that it didn't cause irritation and one even had it used as a throat soother. I personally do find them on the acidic side, and if I eat too many I find they do cause a bit of irritation. It does take a lot of them to get me to that point though.<br /><br />Still, I do find these to be delicious. They're very flavorful and fruity. They make a nice treat to throw into the mix with the other flavors from this brand. I especially like the honey flavored candy.

review/text: I bought these on an impulse, then ignored them in my kitchen cupboard for over a month.  When I got around to eating one, I found it difficult to stop.  They are really that good.  Just a little bit tart and not too sweet... with a rich pomegranate flavor.  I carry them in my purse and car, and when I get an urge for something sweet, I pop one in my mouth.  Okay, they're not as satisfying as a Dove bar, but an entire package contains fewer calories.

review/text: I'm very picky about my chocolate milk flavor - I've tried some that didn't taste like chocolate milk; others had a coffee taste to it which I didn't like at all.  But I really enjoyed the flavor of the Cocoquik.  This one tasted like the real deal.  Despite its excellent taste, I wouldn't have tried it if it was high in calories, but it's only 6 calories per serving, which is a winner in my book.  My only complaint is that I wish it came in little individual serving packets.  It would be easier/more convenient to use it that way.

Low calorie, carb and with stevia instead of the aspartame crap this stuff is great.  I have tried it warm with a little sugar free creamer and it's a delicious filling hot cocoa.  I do want to try the blended version - I don't usually drink cold beverages as I like warm but I will try it. I am curious how it may be as a pudding as well - added with milk.  All in all I am enjoying it.  Try it out!

review/summary: Excellent French roast, good for travel mugs
review/text: I have one of the new "VUE" brewers from Keurig and it took a bit of time to find which VUE cups were the ones I preferred. Interestingly, the VUE cups can be different depths! I compared a light roast to an Italian roast and this French roast, and the Italian roast and French had almost 2X as much coffee. Amazing. That's something interesting about the new VUE cups in that they can be different sizes.<br /><br />The Tully French roast was much nicer than the Italian roast (different brand) in that it still has that burnt, espresso-like aspect but a bit of sweetness and smoothness. I made it up weaker than I usually make my coffee, taking advantage of the variable size option on the VUE. A 12oz cup, made up in a travel mug was delightful and I sipped it all the way on my commute to my office.<br /><br />As to the travel mugs, if you remove (entirely) the black base, your mug may fit but not unless the entire base is off--even to the black undertray. In my case, my fave mug is so tall I had to shim the unit up just a bit and then my 20oz insulated steel mug did indeed finally fit underneath. And so, the coffee stayed nice and hot for at least a half hour.

I was told by my Veterinarian one of the main reasons (besides no soft food) the have great oral hygiene. these natural bones are the right size and the dogs never leave them alone until they are gone or I take them away. Dont give these to them before bed time (crunch crunch crunch). I notice they develop a thirst after chewing for awhile. No digestion problems as a result of eating on these. a great bang for the buck as far as dog treats go. Strongly recommend for dogs that have good teeth.

review/summary: CAIRN TERRIER HEAVEN!
review/text: I recently purchased these bones for my 4 Cairn Terriers. All my dogs absolutely LOVE them ! Even the 11 year old enjoys chewing them and getting off a "little crunchy bit " . The one review stated that they are a little  " messy" . That is true as there are some loose pieces of grizzle  when you open the  plastic wrappr ( that itself is a GREAT feature to be INDIVIDUALLY  wrapped). How I have solved this problem is  that I wash each bone  under running water and then towel dry it before I give to the Cairns . That way there are no loose crumbs. The dogs  enjoy chewing these and it keeps them busy for a long time. When all the the crunchy tendons on the bones are gone , they still enjoy chewing at the  marrow. I have not yet seen any diarrhea or  even any large pieces  chewed off the bones.  They dont seem to splinter either. THUMBS UP for this  product !  They are all natural and  even my Male Cairn who has multiple allergies can enJOY  them!!

They got right into them, but you must supervise as the knobby ends break off and they are about the size of a large marble so could cause some trouble.  I also noticed they splintered, so they were removed at that point. I like the idea, but the safety issue was a problem.

review/summary: USA & Size Matters
review/text: My dog doesn't like big bones. She barely chews them and then they lie around all yucky! These knee bones are a perfect size. She eats them all up. The fact that they're USA bones is a big selling point for me. I would NEVER give my dog foreign bones because I don't know if they are processed correctly to kill bacteria. American dog: American bones!

review/summary: Dogs love them
review/text: We have 2 Min-Pin mixed breed dogs that are 2x - 3x larger than normal min pins. Because of their size, normal treats are either too big or too small. These knee bones are perfect for them and we finally found something they won't power through in 10 minutes. These bones are a bit messy so we either give them to the dogs outside or on a blanket inside. They do have a smell when first being chewed but it goes away as the dogs work on them. We are very happy with these bones.

If you ever find yourself annoyed with your puppy because he/she just wants to play, play, play... give em one of these little things and you will not hear a peep for hours! They are kind of messy, so be sure you give one to your puppy in a safe area. And of course, always keep a close eye on him/her when they have one because there are bones in these!

review/summary: Gross
review/text: These bones are just gross.  First of all, they are not wrapped tight enough to keep them fresh.  When you open them up, they just smell old.  They are dry and brittle and break just by touching them.  I gave one to my 2 year old lab and within seconds it was splintering.  I threw the entire pack away, along with the pack of smokehouse knuckles I bought at the same time.  GROSS. I would not recommend these.  Ask the meat man has way better quality products. Real bones for Real dogs, not this fake crap.  Don't buy!

review/summary: Popular at my house
review/text: I have given the knee cap bones to my 75 pound chocolate lab and 11 pound miniature dachshund for years. When we added a 5 pound miniature chihuahua to the mix I wondered if she could hold on to her bone with the larger and more savvy dogs in the house. No problem! She is quick and limber and gets to chew whichever bone she wants. She likes to get hold of a bone the older dogs have been chewing on because they have softened it up a bit. Then she chews it for all she's worth. The older dogs are indulgent with her, and she always leaves one nearby as a trade. I take the bones out of the mix when they get small enough the lab could choke on them. The little ones get put in the crate with the chihuahua when we go in the car. All my dogs have great teeth and I credit these bones. They never splinter, but the dogs can chew off smooth bits, which they eat. This brand of knee cap bones are huge and provide many hours of chewing enjoyment for my animals. I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Not for strong chewers, part II
review/text: My 5 lb. Pomeranian was able to chew off the large knobby end of the bone, and then managed to chew off a a smaller 1" knuckle-shaped piece from somewhere (by this time I had already taken the larger knob end away from him), getting it stuck in his throat.  Luckily, he threw it up while we were rushing to the vet.  Even small/toy dogs who are big chewers should not be given this product.

review/text: I would not recommend these to ANY dog owner.  First, they are package very poorly.  Most bones are wrapped in plastic with no air inside, these come in loose plastic and therefore lose the freshness that you expect them to have.  They don't smell like regular dog bones..they smell OLD and just gross.  I bought the knee bones as well as the regular dog bones from smokehouse.  Both were gross.  Splintered very easily and were way too brittle for a dog to chew on. Sometimes cheap things---are really just CHEAP.

review/text: Got these for my chocolate lab and it gave her diarrhea.  I also have a black lab mix and she can chew on them just fine.  To be fair though, this chocolate lab has a very sensitive stomach.  I have to take her own food when I board her at the kennel and I don't have to do that for my other dogs so if your dog doesn't have that sensitive a system, I think these will work just fine.  My black lab loves them.  (I just have to keep them away from my chocolate lab.)

It became very useful for me to be able to make my pumpkin bread, cocoa bread, as well as experiment in making other baking goodies with this products.  The vast majority and I mean vast majority of baking ingredients such as meal, flour, breads, i.e. are so so loaded with carbs and diabetics are limited to the amount of carbs one can eat during a meal and throughout the day.  This product "gives back" ways of baking and making things now that we cannot eat anymore, should NOT eat anymore and if one does a very limited and very small portion!  And last, the product baked up just find with me and taste great in my recipes and baked goods!  P.S., I just wished the cost was a tad bit lower.  THANKS!!!

review/summary: Not Too Bad
review/text: We tried this tonight for pizza crust. It really wasn't too bad, but there are some issues to be aware of if you are going to use it. The directions say add 1/3 cup of very hot water and mix to form a soft dough. No way does this happen. you have to get your hands in there and kind of work it all together and then it is pretty dry and crumbly. Kneading brings it together somewhat. As far as getting it in the pan, just be patient. Flatten it out as best you can and then start working from the center and press outwards. It takes a lot of work, but you can cover a 12 inch pan with it. It will be very thin though. I didn't find the flavor all that objectionable if you have a lot of toppings on it. I think the trick to all this low carb stuff is desperation anyway. Once you are on the diet long enough even cardboard tastes good. :0)

review/text: I've used this many times over the past couple of years. Biscuits, breading for fried chicken, low carb brownies, etc. If you are following a low carb lifestyle, this is a great substitute for white flour-laden products. It does have a different taste, and a little aftertaste, but if you are doing the low carb thing, you're probably already familiar with that. I use this for anything I would usually use Bisquick for. I hadn't had a biscuit in over a year when I tried this...I was so glad I found it. Carbalose- the flour they use, is also available from some sites by itself- You can use this in even more recipes.

review/text: I have been doing Atkins for months now and having Carbquik has really helped me stay on it without cheating (much). It takes a little experimentation to make recipes come out right, but once you do it is really good stuff. Adding cream and butter liberally helps make really good biscuits. My girlfriend also makes some great meat and Carbquik casseroles.<br /><br />Some people complain about it not being perfect but ITS LOW CARB BREAD. It tastes amazing when you don't have bread. Anything with a biscuit like texture will come out good and will be a joy to eat.<br /><br />I can only hope that they come out with more products like this. I love my food and this definitely helps me eat the dishes I crave while staying on a diabetic friendly diet.

Cook in liberal amount of butter and you shouldn't be disappointed.  Makes one really big pancake or several smaller ones!

review/summary: A must-have item for your low-carb kitchen
review/text: Carbquik makes perfectly good biscuits, lousy pizza crust (alas, too soggy or too crumbly or both), and VERY good pancakes (toss a handful of blueberries into the batter for an extra treat).  I'm in the latter phases of the Atkins approach to eating, so I don't have to avoid things like bread and biscuits as religiously as I did before (there's really nothing on Atkins that you can NEVER have), but thanks to this product I can enjoy dough/batter-based goodies much more often than I could if I was just eating the regular, carb-heavy versions of these foods as an occasional treat.<br /><br />Carbquik is admittedly a little pricey, but you get a big box of mix that should last you a while.  I ordered this from Amazon, but it actually shipped from the supplier "Carbsmart", which offers a variety of low-carb items for those following a controlled-carbohydrate approach to eating.  By the way, this way of eating has gotten me back to my college weight in record time, and with no trouble maintaining that weight now that I'm there.<br /><br />A final tip about this product: be adventurous and doctor up the recipes on the box as you see fit.  For example, some melted butter and/or a little grated parmesan cheese in the biscuit batter will make for a tastier, more interesting biscuit, and I already told you about the adding-blueberries-to-the-pancake-batter thing.  Chopped strawberries in the pancake batter works great, too!  And I'm still determined to find a way to make decent pizza crust out of this stuff.

I added and added and added liquid until it seemed like pancake consistency.  DO NOT DO THIS!  That first batch, although the crumbs tasted just fine, didn't hold together, couldn't be flipped without the entire thing falling apart, and frankly made a huge mess.  Entirely my fault, admittedly.  I plan to try using it for pizza dough and deep-fry coating soon.

review/text: Attention Low Carbers and Diabetics!!!<br /><br />Yeah, I know.  You've tried other Low Carb products and most SUCK right?  I've been doing this for 12 years -- I lost 160 pounds the first 2 years and then slowly slipped and gained back about 50 pounds over the last 8 years. Believe me, it doesn't take much to put it back on.  I never went back to eating full blown carbs -- just more desserts, maybe a hamburger and fries here and there.  I am now back to strict low carb and the first thing I did was buy my wonderful Carbquik!!  Everything positive everyone said on these Amazon reviews is TRUE!!  I swear!  And the few negatives have got to be from people who are not EXCLUSIVELY low carb.  Is it expensive?  Not when you can finally have delicious biscuits or pancakes and a ton of other previously forbidden foods.<br /><br />I've tried every low carb packaged food around.  It's actually a lot of fun experimenting but I remember some DOOSIES!!  I remember the Atkins Macaroni and Cheese product (10 or 12 years ago)  OH MY GOD!!  Soooooo GROSS.  I literally gagged and choked from just a taste.  That was the worst product I've tried and the rest of just not very good.  CARBQUIK IS AWESOME.  Buy it right now!!  Netrition has it for 11.99 plus 5.95 shipping so it is a much better deal.  Which is unusual for Amazon -- they are usually the cheapest place.  I adore Amazon by the way!!!<br /><br />If anyone out there reading this is hesitant to try low carb, please do yourself a favor and read Gary Taubes "Why We Get Fat and What To Do About It".  It will change your life!<br /><br />Happy Low Carbing....

review/summary: 4.5 Stars For Sure!
review/text: Carbquik sounded too good to be true, but the price in Amazon (and I am surprised at this for isn't Amazon supposed to be the leader in good deals? Or did I just dream that?) is way too high. I have a need to cut down considerably on my carbs consumption and being the bread lover and all things requiring flour, really, I was amazed when I read this flour had 90% less carbs than the leading brand (would that be bisquick?). So I bought a box, no sense in wasting money if it was not going to deliver on the promise, and the very first thing I did was a Banana Nut Bread. It came out very tasty but please note the ingredients besides the flour have a lot to do with the final result. Used EasySweet and brown sugar Splenda instead of regular sugar, walnuts pecans and sliced almonds, cinnamon, heavy cream, etc and did about 3 loaves of what I can easily substitute for any banana bread found in my local supermarket. So that was a score! Next, I tried my luck making oatmeal cookies and these came out pretty tasty and I kept asking myself: "Have I really created the ultimate, guilt free, less stress oatmeal cookie?". This is not a perfect mix, by any means, but compared to what is being offered they seem to be one company that cares for that particular segment and equally deserving, in my opinion, of individuals such as myself and their needs and desires. That alone always elicits an emotional response on my part. I have been known to shed a tear or two of joy in my warm kitchen as I see the final products greeting me hello. Did Waffles and they also came out pretty tasty, have to make sure the ingredients and the recipe are bullet proof. I like to mix the flour with lots of cinnamon which according to science is a great glucose equalizer (did anybody said sugar challenged?, perhaps it is time to realize that sugar can take your joy away together with your teeth, if consumed avidly, which is the way I always consume it until now). So I went to netrition.com where I also buy some very good low carb varieties and was happy with the box. So much, in fact, that I just ordered a new one. I envision a day when the wonderful people of this great country will be able to enjoy sweets without the mortifying thought that it is not too healthy for such nice beings. So Carbquik works and if their nutritional information is accurate it is also a much welcome relief into a world where very little attention is paid and given to the needs and desires of people with some kind of restrictions. Now, don't get me wrong, that does not mean we (I count myself in the list) need to settle for subpar, less appealing product just because the situation demands it. No no no, like the song goes: "you can have your cake and it too" (bob dylan lay lady lay?) and that is exactly what I am intending on doing these Holidays, known for their tempting treats. Carbquik worked for me and I tip my hat (for a bold head must always be protected) to the makers of this helpful product. Not quite 5 Stars but 4.5 Stars For Sure! Happy Holidays and please make sure to compensate all the eating with a walk, swim or a run!

I also have to use MUCH more water in the recipes than is listed on the box in order to get the right consistency- maybe that is where other reviewers are having taste problems?  Pancakes/waffles cooked up well, thicker than expected so make smaller drops of batter per piece and flatten with spatula as they cook if possible to ensure even heating through the middle and so as to not end up burned.<br /><br />My husband and I have been on Atkins for about 6 months now.  We've splurged on IHOP pancakes a few times in the last few months, and I have to say although the texture is a little different with these, add butter and syrup (even sugar free) this stuff tastes like the real thing.  We can even eat them plain and they taste not too far from normal pancakes.  I suggest adding more water/ half and half in the recipe (for pancakes we added 1 cup half and half, almost 1 cup water to get the consistency we like) because you'll find when you mix it up it's like the batter is a black hole for moisture.  My tastes haven't changed too much and I still by far prefer "real" food, but I've found this mix is a completely different ballgame when it comes to "diabetic/diet" foods and there's not too big a difference.<br /><br />Also, the fiber in this is AWESOME!  It will take you a few days to notice though ;-)

review/summary: really good-if you follow directions
review/text: I was very dubious that this stuff would be any good when I bought it, but I just finished making the cheese biscuit recipe on the box and I am AMAZED.  Seriously, they are so good- even my kids like them; they couldn't tell they were low-carb.  They were soft, light, and buttery like the cheddar biscuits at Red Lobster.  I wouldn't recommend using the plain ol' water and carbquick biscuit recipe.  Even if you use real Bisquick, those biscuits are NEVER going to be any good.  Anyone who has made biscuits from scratch knows they have to have a lot of fat in them- either butter or shortening- to be edible.  And you have to stop messing with the dough as soon as everything is moist enough to stick together- don't knead it at all or you'll wind up with hocky pucks.  Anyway,  follow the directions, measure accurately and don't cut corners- margarine?? yuck!  The recipe says to use butter, so don't complain if you don't follow directions and you wind up with a mess.<br /><br />I'll be making the pancakes tomorrow- can't wait!! It's been probably at least a year since I had pancakes...<br /><br />BTW- A couple of reviews on here have been bad because it's too pricey- but that's not really fair.  This price on Amazon is more than twice the price I got mine for elsewhere- that's not Carbquick's fault. As with anything, you have to shop around.

review/summary: Great product, totally overpriced on Amazon!
review/text: Carbquik delivers exactly what it says: a way to make your food significantly lower in carbohydrates without compromising the taste. They provide some basic recipes, but as we all know, the fun of it is experimenting and tweaking a recipe to fit ones taste or develop your own.  I would highly recommend this product for those on a low carb diet or anyone who is diabetic. It will only enhance your quality of life ;o)  That being said, it would be beyond foolish to buy this product from Amazon's site. Bear in mind, I'm a HUGE Amazon.com fan and order primarily from them; usually 2-3 times a week as I am disabled and not able to leave the house very often.  I would give Carbquik a 5 star rating, BUT do NOT buy from here as this price is ridiculously high. You will be paying around twice as much here as you can get it on Netrition.com and that is with shipping costs. Currently this costs $11.99 with a flat rate of shipping of $4.95 for all you order. Significant savings. Hope this helps all that is considering this product.  And Amazon??? Let's quit with the underhanded gouging.

review/summary: Delicious low carb alternative
review/text: I regularly use low carb bake mix.  I have for years.  Sometimes I use it on its own, sometimes I'll do half real flour half lc bake mix.  I've tried Atkins, Bob's Redmill, and Carbquick.  Carbquick is by far the best tasting mix.  It has a lighter less wheaty taste than flour but it's also much more buttery tasting.  Like some reviews have said, it does have a slightly salty taste.  I just reduce the amount of salt called for by 1/2 to 1/3 and that takes care of it.  Bob's Redmill is good but a lot higher in carbs and Atkins tastes too much like soy and the cooked products taste bland and empty.<br /><br />As far as being healthy, I wouldn't necessarily equate Carbquick to a health food but when you're on a low carb diet and use it in moderation it is perfect for what it's meant to be, a low carb substitute for foods you shouldn't be eating a ton of anyway. Every recipe I've made off the box comes out great.  For the drop biscuits I add about 2 T of heavy cream and subtract that amount of water.  Its great as a light breading for Chicken Parm or fish and of course, the pancakes or waffles are great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product and will keep using it as long as they make it.<br /><br />Oh, and like others have said, it's ridiculously overpriced on Amazon.  Get it from Netrition instead.

Since this is such a lo carb staple it was worth setting up a cheaper option.

review/summary: ok but not great
review/text: I have only tried one recipe so far and will re-review after I try a pancake recipe. I tried pizza crust (mix+water) and I thought it tasted fine till the aftertaste. I've been eating organic for about a year and maybe its just my taste buds. A lot of processed foods have weird tastes to me now. Anyways, I wanted some more low carb variety in my diet and I thought why not try this. I have to say that I was disappointed. I ended up scraping off the sauce onto some organic low carb bread I have. I will try a pancake recipe since that seems to be popular.<br /><br />-Tried pancakes and they tasted a lot better. I think that, for me, this mix can not be eaten alone. I have to mix with a few other ingredients to get the taste that I like. Also, I used stevia to sweeten the mix and that worked just fine in place of splenda. Bumped up to four stars.

review/text: This makes much better pizza than the ready made whole wheat pizza crusts that you buy in the stores. First of all, Carbquik takes about 15 minutes to cook, so the vegetables and cheese have enough time to cook and blend together. And knowing that it has 90 percent less carbohydrates doesn't make me feel guilty when I have a pizza craving. I don't feel bloated and sick like I do after I engorge myself on a fast food pizza. Carbquik is the base of a healthy pizza that makes me feel good after eating it. We have reordered many times and always have several boxes in reserve.

review/text: I've tried making recipes from books that use soy and almond flour, but carbquik makes biscuits that even my son says taste like good.  Nobody else ate my muffins.  The price at netrition is much lower and I bought the carbquik there,  I also bought cabalose flour but hasn't tried it yet.<br />It is supposed to be a near substitute for real flour.  Biscuits claim to only have 2 carbs each, so I guess one could even eat a few on the atkins diet during its induction phase.

review/text: This is the worst low-carb product I have ever purchased.  When using it to make pizza crust, I could not even cover half the pizza pan, and the taste was horrible.  I used it to make biscuits, and they were incredibly dry and had no flavor.  I tried again, adding some margarine, and they still tasted awful.  I tried to make pancakes, and the batter was as thick as cement.  I tried adding more liquid, but they were horrible.  I cannot imagine how this product is still on the market. Krusteaz used to make WONDERFUL low-carb baking products, so I know it can be done.  This stuff, however, is awful.

review/summary: I can have bread again
review/text: My first meal using Carbquick was chicken and dumplings. Like it stated on the box you have to cook it gently or it will fall apart. Mine did. But by the time I actually got to eat it I didn't care how it looked. It had been two years since I had made chicken and dumplings. And three months since starting on a seriously low carb diet. I wanted some dumplings. Even though it fell apart it was delicious. The kids ate it and loved it once I could get them to try it. None of them had ever tried chicken and dumplings before. They looked at it like I was offering them slugs for dinner. But hunger won and they tried it. My husband even loved it. We gave it 10 thumbs up. Later we made pancakes. They were also yummy. The only downfall is the price. We cant completely replace flour for the whole family with this product or we would blow our whole grocery budget. So for now we are keeping it just for the low carb eaters. Sadly this means I will have to cook two batches of anything made with flour. One for the dieters and one for the non dieters.

review/summary: Great product, but strange texture
review/text: The taste is different than flour for sure, but in a very good way. Just be careful when substituting it in recipes where you're hoping for something sturdy or stiff. When used in pizza crusts, it tends to crumble and you end up with more of a pizza casserole. However, it makes excellent pancakes, and when used in sauces/rousses, it's basically indistinguishable from flour. All in all, the texture takes getting used to but the taste and low-carb formulation are definitely worth it.

review/summary: A great tasting way to kill your weight loss!
review/text: I used this product under the belief that it was really better than regular flour. Guess what. It isn't. Go to the isle on your grocery store and you will see that there is about a 5 carb/ 20 calorie difference between this and regular wheat flour. NOT TO MENTION, this is WHITE, REFINED, HIGHLY PROCESSED. Taste delicious, if you are on atkins or Dukans and you eat this, you may experience what I experienced. My experience is what made me turn around and realize the truth about this product:<br />1. INSANE cravings for more carbs. You will want them whether it comes from this product or junk. That is because a carb is a carb and regular store bought/ restaurant style/ vending machines/ cafeteria food/ etc will not use this product. You will seriously slip in your will power. The serving size for CARBquick is ONLY 1/4 a cup. You'd do yourself a favor and just spend the money on a regular slice of bread.<br />2. ACNE golore. I have minimal acne. Wheat makes me break out. Atkins gave me the clearest skin ever. After a week of this product I had tiny zits all over my face! Unacceptable!<br /><br />Considering the expense of this product, it is not worth paying for. Carbquick should be known as the Carb that will QUICKLY spike your insulin! You'd do better to get yourself some almond flour or if you are not wheat sensitive (which most people are the FDA just doesn't want to ruin the wheat industry) just buy some real flour!

review/summary: non- GMO Xylitol. Great for sugar free baking.
review/text: Xylitol is an all natural alternative to chemical sugar free sweeteners. I love to use it when baking. Xylitol tends to be less bitter than stevia (another natural sugar substitute). This is great for any one watching their sugar intake. Many body builders use this as a natural alternative to chemical sweeteners like sucralose when trying to cut calories. Another plus, Xylitol is good for you teeth! I use it to make homemade tooth paste and mouthwash that really works. The only downside is that Xylitol can be pricey. Average cost is $7 per pound. I have only tried the Now brand, but I have also heard good things about Ideal brand Xylitol, which also offers a "brown sugar" version. Oh yes, and please do read labels. Toxic to animals! And, causes laxative type effects if over consumed.

review/summary: TERRIBLE peaches!
review/text: There is something wrong with these peaches.  We have purchased Sun Maid dried peaches from grocery stores and Walmart in the past, and they were wonderful.  These are absolutely FOUL tasting.  I also notice that Dried Peaches are no longer shown as one of Sun Maid's products on the Sun Maid web site.  We also no longer find them in our local grocery stores.  Note that Amazon DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS on food products, so I highly recommend against buying these.

review/summary: Good price, but bad smell
review/text: I love dried peaches and normally respect the SunMaid brand. As such, I thought these were a bargain ($12 for a 6-pack). Unfortunately, they have a pungent smell that is kind of funky and turns me off. They are edible, but I think I'll give away my 4 unopened packs to the local food bank rather than eating them.

review/summary: Nasty crap.
review/text: I have trouble believing that what is in the package is truly dried fruit.  Dried poop maybe?  These are downright awful - the smell, the texture, the smell, the taste, oh and did I mention the smell.  I have smelled outhouses and mall bathrooms that are more appealing.

review/summary: chewy
review/text: These dried peaches were not too bad, but when compared to dried apricots, which I love, I would have to say they were a little over-dried. I had to chew them for a long time before I could swallow them.  I actually bought them to use is a recipe for peaches and cream cookies I saw on the food channel.

review/summary: YUK!
review/text: I purchased these tonight, the package says best by (Dec 2009) approximately 3 months from now...these are horrible! The aroma is offensive and the taste is even more offensive. I didn't even finish one piece of the dried peaches. I have tasted other brands that were better, I'm looking for those! Don't waste your money! Honest!

review/summary: Terribly Wrong
review/text: I strongly suspect this caviar, which is widely available in US supermarkets is a reason for fear of caviar in 90% of American population. This product only resembles real caviar in shape and color (artificial). It would not qualify for caviar in Europe. It's from the wrong fish, it has totally wrong taste, and it also has whole periodic table on the label. It's like dying chicken breast into red color, marinating it in steak souse, and selling it as New York Strip Steak...<br /><br />Real caviar doesn't come from lumpfish, and real caviar only have two ingredients - caviar and salt. Try Red Pearl Salmon Caviar if you want to try caviar. You can easily find it on Amazon and other places online.
