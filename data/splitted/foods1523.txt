review/summary: Very good -  Green Tea Frappuccino addict
review/text: I have used this matcha daily for about 6 weeks now. It is very good for what I use it for. I make my own version of Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino. (Once that drink name started to roll of my kids' tongues easily - I realized I was spending too much money on these drinks - and daily!)I am not familiar with various grades of matcha, but did not want something pre-sweetened or modified because I wanted to control the sugar, etc. I make my frappuccino like this: sorry - I do not measure - so you may have to modify these amounts because I am guessing!<br /><br />1 1/2c milk<br /><br />2 heaping spoonfuls (the spoon that's included) green tea powder<br /><br />1/8c simple syrup (I make it myself and keep in fridge for week or so)<br /><br />10+ice cubes (adjust to your taste - depends on size of cubes)<br /><br />Blend this in a blender - longer than you think - pulse first then blend for a bit - I scrape down a bit bc the powder flies around a little and you don't want to lose any. (Simple syrup is 1c water, 1c sugar heated until sugar dissolves) It is much easier than it may sound - I make these daily in the morning. I hope this helps anyone else out there who is addicted to the GT Frappuccino - it is slightly different (I think they use a different gt powder and a honeydew syrup), but I liked mine MORE within the first week of having them!

review/summary: Great for the price & health benefits!
review/text: I suppose I'm unsophisticated about matcha teas since this is the first I've tried, but I really, really enjoy this matcha. It's smooth, mellow, and slightly sweet. I'm picky about loose green teas for steeping; some of those are bitter, & I DON'T like bitter tea. So my favorite teas are this matcha & white loose leaf teas. The cost is honestly too steep for me to buy other better rated matcha for the flavor, so I'm happy I can get this much tea for the price (I've got 3 kids & a lot of other priorities; maybe when I retire...). And for the price, I'm getting all the health benefits of any other matcha (you get all the antioxidants out of matcha since you ingest the whole leaf; brewing teas often makes the extracted antioxidants bitter), plus I don't feel too guilty using it on my face, either. Perfectly nice matcha for the beginner & the frugal. Gave some to my sister, also a novice to matcha, & she loved it too. Worth a try for the price.

review/summary: Not the best quality, but okay for the price
review/text: Teas vary greatly in quality and the price reflects that.  This is a moderately price matcha tea so don't except the best flavor.  It is nutritious so it may be better as a flavor additive to drinks, desserts, broth, etc.  Real matcha can also be bitter and an acquired taste.  Japanese often drink it with tiny sugar candies to offset the bitterness.  Matcha also contains a lot of antioxidants so it may be helpful to some to stat incorporating it into their diet.  If you don't like the taste an easy drink is to mix it with orange juice.

review/summary: Oh so good!
review/text: I got hooked on matcha but found the habit price prohibitive.  I was paying $8 for 1 oz. Then I found this matcha on Amazon and I made my first cup last night and I hated it.  Then I made my second cup this morning a discover the secret of perfect matcha.  The secret is don't use too much of the emerald green powder or you will have one heck of a bitter cup of tea, which is what I did with my first cup.  A dainty scoop (about 1/8 of a tsp) is all you need for a delicious cup and if it tastes bitter use less.  This is medicine, this is pure pleasure and relaxation and a little goes a long way making this a great deal.  I figured if 2 containers weighing 10.58 oz each would have cost me about $160 if I paid the $8 per 1 oz that I was paying when I got hooked on matcha.  So this deal saves me about $120...now I wonder how long will this purchase of matcha last since I feel free to drink as much as I want and am no longer limited to one cup in the morning and one cup in the evening.<br /><br />A good read that explains the philosophy of tea (Teaism) is The Book of Tea, free for kindle and written over 100 years ago.  It explains the 3 historical periods of tea, which matcha being the second period.  The 3 periods of tea refers to the way the tea was prepared.  The first period is caked tea, then whipped tea (matcha), then steeped tea.  Matcha is an ancient way of preparing tea.<br /><br />Consider purchasing the bamboo whisk to whip your matcha because if you don't whip it you will get little clumps.  I drink my matcha from a small bowl purchased at the local Asian store which allows for the whipping of my matcha and is the traditional way.

review/summary: Awesome deal
review/text: This is the first matcha powder I've used so I am unable to comment on it's quality compared to other products. You do get a LOT for your money. These two boxes will last me at least 6 months.<br /><br />I read about this in Muscle & Fitness magazine for its numerous health benefits, mainly it's high content in anti-oxidants, cancer prevention, detoxification, increased fat metabolism and energy. One tiny measuring spoon of this stuff is 10 times more potent than regular green tea and it's noticable. I have been using green tea extract in capsule form and it is no comparison to the matcha powder. I feel more energized and alert without any jitters or insomnia. I feel less food cravings over the course of the day. My metabolism has increased. I am able to eat 100-200 additional calories per day (yes, I'm one of those calorie counters) yet my body fat has decreased by 2%. I also believe it enhances your immune system as I have made it through the entire flu season without getting sick from any of my contagious co-workers.<br /><br />The powder is easy to use. I micro-wave 1/3 cup of filtered water in a small cup, stir in a measuring spoon of matcha powder, then dump it into ice water or protein shake. The taste is creamy and does not require sweetener for my taste. I am a matcha convert for life. My next project will be making green tea ice cream with this stuff.

review/summary: Price is OK, flavor a bit bitter
review/text: Got some matcha in Japan from the airport and it was surprisingly tasty.  Still, you are told not to steep green tea for more than a couple minutes or else the bitter flavor comes out.  So, with matcha it's just gonna happen, since you can't take out the tea bag.<br /><br />That said, the Japan matcha was more granular than a "powder", more like sand really, and did not produce much bitterness even after ten minutes in hot water.  This Taiwan tea by comparison is a true powder.  It is difficult to dissolve, clumping a quite a bit, and produces a flavor that within a few minutes in hot water becomes bitter, then later even more bitter.<br /><br />UPDATE: It turns out you use a lot less of it than you do of the Japanese matcha I had.  The powder, since it is so fine, goes much further.  To help you with this, they have a spoon in the box to right-size the servings.  I was using a much larger teaspoon instead previously.  Using the smaller amount, it works great for hot tea and does not become bitter.

review/text: I've got everyone in my office hooked on this stuff, and I drink it daily. It's a stronger stimulant than coffee, and has a smoother, less-jittery feel to it thanks to the Theanine and general nutritional content. It's quite tasty and a great deal for the price.<br /><br />I love the product but don't really follow the tradition whatsoever. I prepare mine in a metal, insulated thermos. One scoop of matcha per coffee-cup sized glass of hot water. Put lid on thermos and shake vigorously. Shaking has provided the absolute smoothest, foamiest blend I've seen so far and gets rid of any clumping. I cut the flavor a bit with honey, but really it just tastes like strong tea. It's important not to add too much matcha to your water or you'll end up with a thick sludge of green tea at the bottom of your glass.<br /><br />The only downside to this beverage is that if you drink it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, it can make you feel very nauseous. Eating a piece of toast can fix this, though.<br /><br />Another recipe that cures the nausea is: One cup water, Two cups vanilla almond milk. Add honey/sugar and ice. Delicious!

review/summary: This is very LOW QUALITY matcha
review/text: This matcha is terrible compared to real Japanese ceremony-grade matcha. It is bitter, gritty, and generally doesn't taste good.<br /><br />So, why did I give it 5 stars?<br /><br />Quality matcha can easily cost USD $2.00 per GRAM. At that price, 10.53 oz. (the amount in a single ~$21 box of Vita-Life) would cost about USD $600.00!<br /><br />The trade off is that this is really bottom-end quality that a Japanese tea aficionado would scoff at. That said...who cares? If you want the Matcha experience, go elsewhere, but if you want all well-documented health benefits of matcha/green tea as well as the convenience of having a powder that will mix with many other foods, this is a great deal.<br /><br />I use about a teaspoon of powder on my morning breakfast cereal, on smoothies, and I use about a quarter of a cup per batch of cookie dough. To date I am on my 24th box since February 2, 2009.<br /><br />About caffeine:<br /><br />Green tea (and therefore matcha) does contain caffeine. Very roughly, one teaspoon contains about as much caffeine as a 6oz cup of black coffee. The caffeine in matcha tends to be released more slowly, though -- over a period of about 6 hours vs. 2 to 3 for coffee. Do not use this in anything you will be consuming before going to sleep!

Honestly, not only does it make it cheaper and more convenient to enjoy the same flavor, but our homemade smoothies made with this stuff taste way better than the ones from the downtown Jamba Juice.

review/summary: Well worth purchasing this tea.
review/text: I've used this tea a few times so far. It is pleasant tasting with no hint of any "fishy" taste that I can detect. (I mention this because, before purchasing, I did read other reviews where that criticism appeared.) The tea has a slight bitterness which I noticed one time and not the other. As a non-ceremonial grade tea, I believe it is well worth buying.

review/summary: Good For Upping the Nutritional Ante
review/text: I bought this recently. When I received it, I was surprised at how much you get...there is a decent amount of tea in each cute green cardboard box. (No, they didn't just toss it in a box, there is a silver bag inside the box for keeping it fresh.)<br />I like to drink chilled green tea, so I bought some Lipton green tea iced tea mix. I was sipping it (it tastes great) and thought, this stuff doesn't have enough actual green tea in it, so I did some looking around and found the powdered Macha. I am the definitive tea drinker and have had almost every tea in the galaxy, but ONE...this one. I am glad I bought it; it adds extra nutrients (EGCG, some more antioxidants, plus it boosts metabolism) to my regular beverages and you can add it to anything you want to..like, say, a smoothie or a cookie recipe. (Martha Stewart's website has a recipe for green tea ice cream and green tea shortbread leaves (cookies) you could make with this powder. I look forward to trying to make ice cream with it, seems unusual.<br />The one caveat I offer for this tea is this: do NOT drink beverages made with this tea *on an empty stomach* or you will rue the day. I did this once, and got a major tummy ache. Let my experience make you wiser. :)<br />And Enjoy.

If anyone knows these answers please comment and let me know. I have been reading a lot about matcha tea and these were some questions that were raised by these articles. Not a certain brand of tea, mind you, these were generic concerns about matcha teas in general.

review/text: This is just what it says. Matcha green tea. It has a slightly bitter taste...but it is not very noticeable...especially depending on what type of drink you are making. I love to sit down and have a nice cup of hot green tea...but I am a teacher, and lack on time, so in the mornings need a quick healthy drink. I always turn to my trusty Instant Breakfast! I usually buy the chocolate (which I still do!), but I made my own drink with the vanilla Instant Breakfast and 2 nice scoops of the green tea powder. It is the best morning drink (for me at least!) This does also make great hot green tea! Enjoy!!

review/text: This is my first purchase of green tea powder.  I bought this to mix in smoothies and add to my favorite brewed teas.  The powder is very versatile and one only needs to use a small amount (I can't imagine using more than this box in one year...great value).<br /><br />The tea powder comes in a convenient and attractive box.  I keep it in my refrigerator...fits neatly on the inside of the door for easy access.<br /><br />One word of caution...this is tea...and it contains caffeine.  So, if you are a decaf lightweight...I'd recommend that you test a small quantity to see how your body reacts to it. I love it!

review/summary: Interesting...
review/text: This powder was not really what I was expecting. When I say that, I mean that I really didn't care for the taste nor the color. This was my 3rd order of matcha green tea powder (3 separate orders from 3 separate vendors). My first order was from MatchaTeaSource and was premium grade matcha green tea powder,I also paid a premium price for this as well as premium shipping costs. My second order was the Teavana DoMatcha, through Amazon and although I liked this equally as well, the price for a small tin of tea was also at a premium plus shipping. I then came across the VitaLife Matcha Green Tea Powder - the color was not the bright green I was expecting and the powder did not mix as easily as the other teas. The aroma I got from the tea was not pleasant and reminded me of fresh cut grass. I have been drinking hot green tea lattes and iced green tea lattes using the matcha green tea powder for about one year. I am saving a lot of money by not buying these at Starbucks and mine actually taste better. I use 2-3 tsp of the matcha green tea powder, 8 oz cold nonfat milk and one Truvia sweetener - I mix this using a latte whip or a martini shaker (if iced). It's awesome!

review/text: I had powered matcha tea at my local coffee shop and this was nothing like what I expected.  It tasted quite a bit like seaweed. I managed to drink a little of this but it needed much doctoring.  It became tolerable if I added sugar, ginger and milk. It also did not dissolve well even when I used my hand held blender.  I would not recommend it unless you are creative with adapting seaweed for other uses.

review/summary: Horseradish, Spirulina and Turmeric.
review/text: Those are the listed ingredients of this ersatz wasabi. Spirulina? Blinking algae! Have you ever wondered why the wasabi paste in tubes and the wasabi you mix with powder bear so little taste-resemblance to any wasabi you've had in a 'ryokan' in Japan? Might it be because there is very little real 'wasabi' in the majority of products sold in the USA? But this product is not the most absurd; there's another brand, being sold for $6 an ounce, which is mostly powdered spinach, and yet another that bulks itself out with $6-an-ounce cornstarch. Nevertheless, don't pester yourself by reading the labels! You'll just get yourself into a tizzy of frustration.<br />Meanwhile, note that most customers are happily satisfied with this product. I might be satisfied, too, if I hadn't lived in Kyoto for a year. Does anyone in the amazoo have experience with cultivating her/his own wasabi plants?

review/text: Shocked to see so many positive reviews for this product. As another reviewer said the ingredients are: horseradish, turmeric, spirulina. Calling this wasabi is like calling food coloring saffron. And you don't have to have lived in Japan to see that this stuff ain't wasabi. The instructions say "mix powder to form a paste". Well, it does have heat. But what you get is this ugly, pale and chalky paste. You need to use a LOT of powder and very little water to get it to the right consistency. Next time, I'll try getting my hands on REAL wasabi root from the asian grocery store.

But here's the skinny: sure, it works as a cereal (or a garnish for a flake-based cereal) and all those other things, but this stuff was put on Earth for the sole purpose of being a yogurt mix-in. I don't know what sort of magic happens when you drop a scoopful of this stuff in a bowl of vanilla yogurt (mango was another great choice), but some sort of magic does happen. Once I'd tried it that way, there was no looking back. It's now a staple in the kitchen. I don't think I've eaten yogurt without it in the last month.

review/text: I thought this was very good.  It was really crunchy, and I could taste the blueberries.  I also liked how there were several different grains -this gave it some variety (and the flaxseed raised up the levels of Omega-3s, which is great).<br /><br />It was also low in sodium, had NO saturated fats, and had FIVE grams of fiber per serving.  This is a great midday snack to give you the complex carbs that you need (without a large blood sugar spike) to get you to the next meal.<br /><br />I would definitely buy these in the future and would throw them in my luggage as a snack on a plane, or a treat to munch on when hiking.<br /><br />No chocolate chips needed in this granola snack! Recommended.

Normally I need granola to be with something: Milk or yogurt or fruit cobbler or something like that. This stuff I was eating out of the bag like snack chips.  It has just the right cinnamon taste, and the oats taste fresh. You know how some granolas seem sort of cardboardy and tasteless? This does not. The clusters are crisp and flavorful--not just cinammon and sweet, but hearty and oaty.  It's like the best part of a healthy cereal...minus the milk and the not so tasty part.<br /><br />If this came in snackpacks I'd buy a ton to tuck in my bag for lunches.  Heck that's what I did with half this bag!

review/text: While this product didn't feature a lot of big clusters, I found it quite tasty and loaded with healthy ingredients.  It had enough cinnamon to complement the taste, but not too sweet.  With nearly as much fiber (15g) as sugar (18g) per cup, and 9g of protein, one could definitely do worse.<br /><br />Apparently one of the issues that comes with relatively low sugar granola is that the clusters don't stick together so well.  However, this is not much of an issue if you're eating this with yogurt or milk.<br /><br />Overall, a great product worth recommending if you like granola.

By far the best granola type food I've ever eaten and it's super healthy. I eat it sprinkled on nonfat plain yogurt that I infuse with cinnamon, with soy milk, or by itself, of course. I sometimes make up an on the go snack bag which varies but always has these tasty clusters in it and some kind of dried fruit, raw, unsalted pecans, almonds or walnuts, goji berries, etc. I will be trying the other flavors soon. A great product all around & Amazon's price for a 3 pack of 11 oz. bags is a bargain.

review/text: Granola is awesome, KIND is a great company and this was delicious, but this is perhaps not the healthiest choice. There's a surprising amount of sugar in here, and not to be super-picky, but the flax seeds pretty much just get stuck in your teeth, where they have minimal health benefits. This was also rather on the tough side as far as chewing, which can be a concern for some.

review/summary: Really good!
review/text: The Oat and Honey clusters reminds me of the granola cereal that I used to love as a kid, but this has much less fat and still tastes great.  It's gluten free on top of it!  Since I am Celiac, my breakfast cereal choice is somewhat limited.  I was looking for something different to break up the monotony and decided to give this a try.  I am glad I did.  The only downside to this is that it is a bit expensive.  I think it is worth it though.  I just ordered the Maple Walnut clusters and looking forward to trying them.

review/summary: Granola with a bad flavor
review/text: Maybe I got a bad bag but... the flavor of the vanilla blueberry was unpalatable. I love granola and was looking forward to trying this healthy version but it tasted old, almost as if it had "turned." If it weren't so expensive, I would try it again. I love the idea of including flax seeds in the granola.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Granola
review/text: Best granola on the market! Would never guess it's gluten free. I order six bags at a time to make sure I never run out. I eat it straight from the bag as a snack, put it on top of yogurt, and eat it as cereal with milk. Tried many other brands I could find locally but none even come close, so I will continue to order Kind.

review/summary: love Kind products
review/text: As a lover of Kind bars, I was excited to see this granola. I'm generally not a fan of grains unless they're sprouted grains, but this was great. Low glycemic and tasted SO good. It's full of amaranth, quinoa and millet as well as flax which provides the Omega 3. I love how the blueberries add a nice sweet/tart taste but was disappointed to learn that they're blueberry puree as well as apple and plum puree. I wish they were just dried blueberries.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great granola and has a nice depth / complexity of taste.

review/summary: Vanilla covering mars the texture and taste of the snack
review/text: I wanted to like this healthy snack, and perhaps I chose the wrong flavor.  The blueberries were nice -- tangy and flavorful.  The grain is crunchy.  But the vanilla covering (or glue or whatever it is that is sticking the grains together) has an unpleasant rough, starch-like texture and a bland aftertaste, kind of like that chalky aftertaste you get from Pepto-Bismol (although NOT that flavor.)<br /><br />I think I will give this brand another try in another flavor.

review/summary: Healthy but still tastes good.
review/text: I'm not a health nut. In fact I'm a foodie who wouldn't give up anything in the name of health. I do tend to think that stuff like this sacrifice taste and don't buy them. So why did I get this? the description had said they could be sprinkled on yogurt and I do eat lots of yogurt.<br /><br />Surprisingly, however, these taste good. I like them. For the most part, I ate these with milk as morning cereal or I snacked on them. I never got to put them on yogurt (which was my original intention). If these come with the subscribe and save plan, i'll order it just to have them over. Otherwise, they'll be an as needed buy.<br />A little goes a long way with these. The didn't taste like raw bran or some "healthy" cereal completely robbed of taste. Instead, even a sweet tooth like me liked it. Just a reference, I don't drink skim milk because i think it taste like water so that should give a little idea of where i'm coming from.<br /><br />My only con with these: they packages aren't big. Not like regular cereal bags. They're much smaller.  I wish they came a little bigger which is why i took of a star. But then you don't need to eat much to feel full so i guess....<br /><br />Anyway, If you're the kind of person who avoids stuff like these because you think they taste bad, try this and be amazed. If you're a health food junkie, well, now you don't have to sacrifice taste.<br />Cheers!

review/summary: This is an HONEST, kind, product!
review/text: I find myself searching grocery store shelves. I read the labels, scour the freezers and even the so-called healthy products-aren't. This wonderful granola type snack is different. It contains healthy grains but is minus the un-healthy sugars, syrups and fats. I found that it tasted great. In fact I prefer it over the sickening sweet alternatives marketed by the food packing giants. With flax seeds it is uber healthy with so many essentials. The cinnamon taste is pleasant and if I am not mistaken, cinnamon is thought to be a "fate burner"!<br /><br />Be kind to yourself and give Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters a chance!

review/summary: hmmm.....Tasty!
review/text: This is a lovely little granola. Just enough sweet, but not TOO much. The vanilla/blueberry clusters add taste interest without being overpowering. I can take or leave the flax seeds since they aren't well digested in whole form for most folks. Ground whole flaxseed sprinkled on your food, or flax seed oil are both more beneficial since they are more easily digested and utilized by the body. The whole flax seeds do give some good textural interest along with the grains. Very nice with Greek yogurt and fruit and NOT "cardboard-y" at all. Definitely a two thumbs up rating from me.

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: I'm not a granola expert of fanatic, but I thought I might enjoy this product more because I like blueberry and vanilla.<br /><br />When I opened it, it smelled musty, like a year-old box of cereal.  I found that very odd, but plunged ahead anyway.  It was disappointing, because I picked up on pretty much no blueberry flavor (or blueberries, for that matter).  It tasted like really dense granola.  From a pure flavor and eating enjoyment aspect, I did not really care for it.<br /><br />From a health standpoint, this product is free of everything "bad" and full of "good stuff"...heavy on flax.  I'm not a health food fanatic, so again, this was lost on me.  But my son, age 24, really seemed to enjoy it.  He's much more attentive to what he consumes, and I think he liked the taste as well.  He ended up being the only consumer of this product.  (My wife liked it less than me.)<br /><br />I have to conclude, based on the non-scientific study of my family, that this product appeals to folks accustomed to more "healthy" snack foods...and not folks like me who have no problem with more "commercial, processed" snacks.  I had hoped that KIND would be both tasty and healthy...but it fell short.  I'd be a two-star reviewer...my son would be 4...so I'm splitting the difference.

review/text: My son and I both enjoyed this granola as cereal in the morning. The clusters stayed crunchy in milk and it was quite flavorful. We could see bits of blueberries and their flavor was noticeable while not too overpowering. The flax seeds did sometimes stay in the milk afterwards but as long as you drink the milk you get their full benefit. We both enjoyed the taste and the variety of grains included. It is relatively healthy and we've always been satisfied with KIND products. This is a tasty granola option.

review/summary: My kind of snack!
review/text: I love having something in my pantry I can take out and munch on without guilt--this is exactly my kind of snack.<br /><br />The best thing about Healthy Grains Clusters is how healthy they are. They're made with whole grains, including quinoa, one of the healthiest grains out there. The flax seeds are an excellent way to get important omega-3 fatty acids into your system.They're also a very good source of fiber. Best of all, they're made with all-natural ingredients.<br /><br />Besides being good for your diet, these crunchy clusters are addictively good--both by themselves and as a yogurt topping. I wasn't sure how'd they would actually taste, as I've had plenty of bland health foods. They turned out to be one of my new favorite snacks!<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent granola that satisfies your sweet tooth.

review/summary: Nice crunch and better than Bear Naked Granola
review/text: For years I have been eating Bear Naked Granola (Fruit and Nut, in the orange bag) with vanilla yogurt and berries as one of my favorite breakfasts.  When I was offered an opportunity to review this similar product, I was skeptical that anything could top my favorite granola.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the Kind Cinnamon Oat Clusters granola.  It actually tasted fresher than Bear Naked and I can eat 1/3 of a cup for roughly the same calories as 1/4 cup of Bear Naked.  (The rest of the nutritional info is roughly the same between the two brands.)  The Kind granola has a nice crunch and didn't get soggy when mixed with yogurt.  The cinnamon flavor is subtle and not overpowering.  It's packed with whole grains, Omega 3 and other healthy ingredients.  It would also be good served as a cereal with milk.  It's a bit more expensive than Bear Naked, but if both were on the same shelf, I would definitely reach for the Kind Cinnamon Oat Clusters.  I would also be interested in trying other versions/flavors of this product.

review/summary: Nongluten granola
review/text: I do not eat gluten, so it was important to me that this product be non-gluten.  I looked the package over and nowhere did I see "without gluten" on it, except in the ingredients where it lists the whole grains used to make this product, it did say "gluten free oats" but still I wondered about the other grains.  Another ingredient was amaranth, which has no gluten (neither do oats, but they easily become contaminated by gluten in processing) so I checked this site and lo and behold, it says that it is non gluten!  So, not on the package (unless I am missing it?) but yes, on this site.<br /><br />I took this bag of granola with me to my daughter/husband's house and they tried it too.  It was a very nice tasting cereal, loaded with whole grains.  I did not experience what some other reviewers said, with having no clusters in their bag (in other words, some got kind of a granola dust, but mine were big chunks, just like they are supposed to be).  Mine was packed in a box with some of those air pocket things, so it came through just fine.  I also didn't notice any funny aftertaste.  The cost is $16.56 for 3, 11 oz bags, or $14.08 through "subscribe and save" ($4.69 per bag).  I think this is a little higher than our local Walmart Bear Naked granola, but not that much higher.  Also, Bear Naked granola isn't gluten free (the oats are not gluten free, to my knowledge), whereas the Kind variety is.<br /><br />Although the variety of this cereal that I had (Cinnamon and Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds) did not have glycerin as an ingredient, I noticed that my bag of Bear Naked fruit and nut granola did have glycerin, apparently with the raisins and cranberries that were in it.  I have to admit, I had always associated glycerin with soap (like Neutrogena) but note too that nitroglycerin (an explosive) has glycerin.  Glycerin is also, apparently, a sweetener (probably why they use it with raisins and cranberries).<br /><br />In the end, I would say that if you like the taste of this granola, the price on this one isn't bad.  And taste is a matter of, um, taste.  Because it is non-gluten, I may just buy this instead of the Bear Naked granola that I usually buy (yes, I know that Walmart's Bear Naked granola isn't non-gluten, but I like it and it is cheap and for reasons that I do not understand, I do not have to absolutely abstain from gluten, although I usually do).  I would definitely give this granola a chance and if you like the flavor, go for it!

review/summary: A bit too sweet and pricey, but it's a delicious all-natural product
review/text: PROS:<br /><br />- It's a very natural product. Just look at the ingredients: Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), citrus fiber, citrus pectin.<br /><br />- It tastes delicious. The cinnamon comes through nicely.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- I felt it was slightly too sweet. Obviously, that's subjective, so look at the sugar content: 5g of sugar in a 29g serving. The good news is that "sugar" isn't in the list of ingredients. The product gets its sweetness from the juices in the ingredients. It claims it's "low glycemic," but you might want to be skeptical about that.<br /><br />- Only 2-4 realistic servings per package. Most cereals have a serving size of 3/4 cup. Here's it's just 1/3 cup. On the other hand, the serving size is 29 grams, which is comparable to the average serving size weight for other cereals. The package claims 11 servings. Sure, if you're just nibbling. But if you have a standard bowl of cereal, you'll find that it only has 2-4 realistic servings (depending on your bowl size). So it goes quick! This makes it somewhat pricey and lowers the overall value.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: If you're not concerned about the relatively high price and you like a sweet cereal, then this is a perfect product!

review/summary: Tasty, healthy product with multiple uses
review/text: Though I'm in the latter phases of the Atkins approach to eating and can now be a little more relaxed about my carbohydrate intake (people slam the Atkins plan for being unrealistic, but it's only the initial phases that are truly restrictive), I still keep an eye out for needlessly excessive carb counts.<br /><br />Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds are therefore right up my alley.  They're tasty and crunchy, perfect for stirring into my plain yogurt, sprinkled over hot cereal, or just enjoying in a flavorful small handful every now and then. A third of a cup serving- more than enough for the uses I mentioned- contains only 17 grams of net carbs (22 grams of total carbs minus the 5 grams of fiber).  For calorie watchers (like my wife), total calories for that amount aren't bad, either (about 130).<br /><br />As I've said in the past when I was pleased with a free sample of a product from the Amazon Vine program, I'm definitely open to picking up a fresh supply of these healthy, good-tasting clusters at my own expense once my free supply runs out.

review/summary: Tasty but dry.
review/text: I am not a health food fanatic. In fact like many Americans I am overweight. Deciding to make my forties a healthier decade means making some changes. So I am exploring healthy food options.<br /><br />Kind vanilla blueberry clusters is healthy but is it tasty?<br /><br />The first morning I had it with milk. Crunchy, tasty but a waste of time. Even though it was soaked in milk it wasn't really a cereal and it was still dry. How? I wound up drinking the milk from the bowl at the end. - fail.<br /><br />I bagged some and took it as a snack. Better. Great and crunchy. Tasty but have a drink handy - Good.<br /><br />The next morning I had Greek fat free yogurt and sprinkled some on top. It required some hands crumbling clusters but not really that much work. It added a bit of flavor to the creamy goodness that is Greek yogurt (not the other kind of tangy yogurt) and it gave it some crunch. Not thirsty after words ) the best way to have it.<br /><br />Over all if you like crunch and want to add some healthy omegas to your diet this is a good way to do it. Especially if you eat yogurt or like snacking. If you are looking for an alternative to sugary cereal or hate dry food look elsewhere this just won't cut it.<br /><br />Personally I would keep it but not as a breakfast food.

review/summary: a tasty breakfast or snack
review/text: I've been eating KIND bars for a couple of years.  They are a truly healthy alternative to the many so-called health & energy bars that have flooded the market in the last decade.  KIND is also a socially conscious company which donates portions of its proceeds to worthy causes.  They've now added cereals to their line of bars.  I tried the Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds.  It was tasty & satisfying.  It was tasty with milk, or on yogurt (Greek in my case), or as a stand alone snack.  However, the portion sizes listed on all food products are ridiculous & don't reflect real life.  At least not the life I know.  However, even doubling the portion size the result will still be a filling meal which is low in calories, high in protein, low in sodium, low in sugar, with 0 sat. fat & 0 trans fat.  That the package is just 11 oz. in size is one of my major complaints.  This is a healthy alternative to many of the granolas which are on the market.

The amazing variety of grains used in this is a selling point to me, I like the variety and it's not over-sweet. I do like granola that's not all broken up into tiny little pieces, but has some chunks in it, which this does have.<br /><br />Kind granola is also gluten free and vegan friendly. If you are on a restricted diet this is perfect. I thought the cinnamon was just the right amount, not overpowering. To me, things that are 'healthy' for you aren't very useful unless they taste good too, this tastes good. Enjoy it on yogurt, or out of the bag, or with milk. I put it in little baggies and throw it in my backpack for a snack at school.

I found the Cinnamon Oat Clusters delicious coming in close as a first compared to the Maple Walnut Clusters which currently lines my cupboards.<br /><br />I feel this product is a great addition to add to my yogurt, to eat with milk as a breakfast cereal, and it's also a good stand along snack. It's got a great crunch, the texture is desirable, and the flavor is pretty tasty. My 3 year old which a picky eater loves this stuff so you can be sure that I'll probably be taking advantage of the awesome subscribe and save deal that Amazon.com offers!<br /><br />If you are wanting to try it before subscribing, you can find this product in most stores. I was thrilled to find at my local Market of Choice grocery store and am so glad to see it here on Amazon.

review/summary: Nice crunch, slightly bland taste
review/text: Unlike some of the other reviewers' experience, the product I received had nice big clusters and a good crunch to it.  It seemed slightly bland to me, though, so I added an extra dash of cinnamon and a little nutmeg, which made it taste much better in my plain Greek yogurt.<br /><br />Overall, I like the oat clusters and I like the extras that are in it, such as the flaxseed and Omega-3,  which make the calories worthwhile.

review/text: I wasn't fond of this with yogurt, but it's SUPER with milk and a splash of fruit/nut mix. I let it soften a little and snarfed it all up! Very highly recommended.

review/summary: Really tasty
review/text: I received one pack of Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds through Amazon Vine, and it made a great breakfast for me. Very tasty, and the flax seeds gave it some texture as well. My only regret is that I didn't get more--it was so delicious that I ate it all in one serving. I'll probably be ordered some more soon.

review/summary: not a granola fan, but I liked this one
review/text: I've always thought I should like granola, but I had never found a packaged one that really did it for me. I'm a big fan of KIND bars, so I was excited to hear that KIND had a new granola product line. Finally, I've found it, a package granola product worth eating.<br /><br />As with other KIND products, I like that their granola is made of natural ingredients. As their slogan says "ingredients you can see and pronounce." But, of course, that only gets you so far if the taste isn't there. KIND granola comes through on the taste to though. It's sweet but not too sweat, and I liked (unlike some other reviewers) that the blueberry flavor wasn't too strong. The texture, which is always tricky with granola, was also just right - the perfect combo of crunchy and chewy.<br /><br />I enjoyed mine both on its own and with milk. However, I do agree with the other reviewers who said that larger clusters would be nice when you're eating it on its own.<br /><br />Oddly, my 15-month old daughter also loved this granola. She would actually shake with excitement when she saw the bag come out of the pantry.

review/summary: Snack or cereal
review/text: Excellent whole grain cereal. Lightly sweetened with brown sugar. It is very similar in taste to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7TH24">Heartland Granola Cereal, Original, 16-Ounce Box (Pack of 6)</a> but of course with flax and a very light blueberry taste.<br /><br />It is easy to eat as a snack because most of the granola clusters are pretty large. Four kids and I wiped it out in just a few minutes. Highly recommended. Excellent taste and healthy ingredients.

review/summary: Great snacks for in the car or at home
review/text: My wife and I had to run out the door for a class and didn't have time to really get any food in advance.  Luckily I had this and took it in the car with us.  It was a great snack to have on hand and I like the fact that it's not overly sugary as these granola products can be.  Flax is an added bonus as it is one supplement that I always want to take but never seem to get around to do doing so.  The reclosable bag worked very well for us.  The last serving I put over milk to see how it would work as a breakfast cereal and that was fine as well.  My only complaint is that it wasn't very clustery, it tended to break down into smaller grains of stuff, but who really cares about that most of the time?  The taste was awesome.

review/summary: Tasty and healthy
review/text: Kind makes a range of great products with minimal additives and fresh, bright flavors. These clusters are nice and crunchy, and great for any granola-type use. The clusters are not very big, so this product is better for me as a yogurt topper or breakfast cereal than snacking. The blueberry-vanilla flavor was a bit muted but I'm happy to compromise on that for such a hearty, healthy product.

review/summary: Incredibly good
review/text: Not only are these really tasty, the ingredients list is pretty awesome as well. I decided to order some more after this Vines-provided bag was gone. For the record? The peanut butter flavor tastes like someone mixed granola with Nutter Butters. Amazing. The cinnamon is a hit with my wife, who hates all forms of healthy granola/seed foodstuffs.<br /><br />Great product.

review/text: This is the kind of thing that I can't have in the house because I can't stop eating it!  It has flax seeds!  It has terrific ingredients!  It is FANTASTIC!  Will be buying this (only in a moment of weakness like right now when I'm starving) and I recommend it highly.

review/summary: Yummy but Crummy
review/text: Maybe it was the way these were shipped -- perhaps they sat around a while or got beat up in the delivery process -- but I was a little bummed that there was so much "dust" at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />Other than that, these were very yummy.<br /><br />I was a little skeptical, being "healthy" as they claim, that it might be boring or dry -- but it was neither.<br /><br />The bag is a good size, and more than enough for a few snacks.  They were great as a cereal and as yogurt toppings.<br /><br />The cinnamon was noticable but not overpowering, and made it just sweet enough.  The product also tasted fresh, and I appreciated the resealable bag.

review/summary: Tasty and Satisfying
review/text: I received my pack of Kind Healthy Grains Clusters in a firm, cardboard "envelope" that protected it enough that it was not pulverized as some reviewers had experienced.  The cereal had varying sized clusters of fruit and grains as well as some loose, individual ones, similar to other granolas.  I tried it as a snack one evening when I had the munchies and found it tasty and satisfying.  It was crunchy and not too sweet and I enjoyed the wholesome taste.  I didn't notice a lot of vanilla flavor and the blueberries were not as flavorful or large as the ones in "Blueberry Morning" cereal, but they were identifiable as blueberries.  I have not tried it with milk or in yogurt yet but feel that it would be very good if eaten that way.  I would purchase it again.

review/summary: VANILLA blueberry FLAVOR ... great in YOGURT or alone!
review/text: In my quest to eat healthier, I'm been trying to eat more Greek Yogurt and healthy grains.  I'm not a huge fan of plain yogurt, but with these grains added, it makes a delicious, filling snack/mini-meal.  I got the VANILLA BLUEBERRY flavor and I thought the KIND brand was very comparable to BEAR NAKED.  This particular variety (VANILLA BLUEBERRY) was slightly moisturer (less dry) than its Bear Naked equivalent.  I don't really like blueberries that well, but the blueberries were not that overwhelming in this mix (as far as taste).  In fact, the chewy texture was about the extent that I even noticed that blueberries were in the mix.  My VERY picky-eater son really liked this mix also.  He doesn't like much, so that says a lot.  He ate it both plain and in milk (as cereal) and said that it tasted good.  In fact, he has taken it to school as his snack a couple of times.  I would/will definitely be eating more of this.

review/summary: Great With Anything But Itself
review/text: At the office I work at I gotta have a fulfilling snack that won't make me put on any more pounds and these Kind Healthy clusters get me most of the way there.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients and nutritional information the clusters certainly have the healthy stuff down with no real adverse ingredients (IE: gluten) that seem to plague just about anything in the grocery store.  It was nice to have a healthier alternative compared to the usual peanuts that I have.<br /><br />The clusters were great with yogurt and milk and that was mostly how I had it.  However, the one time I had the clusters by themselves I wasn't all that impressed as they left a lingering aftertaste and not the good kind either.  Perhaps it was the vanilla but I had to drink some juice to get the annoying taste out of my mouth and they get stuck easily in your teeth.  In short, these clusters are next to no good on their own but are ideal with anything else.<br /><br />A great alternative to munch food but you'll wanna have them in conjunction with something else less you get a weird aftertaste.

review/summary: Is It Stale?
review/text: Like a few other reviewer here, I noticed right away after opening the bag (Cinnamon Oat Clusters) that it smelled like stale grains or stale peanuts. It's a pretty strong odor but it wasn't overpowering.<br /><br />Since I am not familiar with some of the grains in the bag, I thought maybe they have some distinct odors that are similar to what I assume is a stale smell. For reference, I know the smell of flax seed, oats, and rice, and they smell nothing like what I was smelling from this bag.  Despite the strange smell, I still tried a few bites, and the taste wasn't too bad but I KNOW it would have been better without that lingering smell.<br /><br />Just like the others who have complained, the expiration date on my bag is August 29, 2012, so the product should have still been good.<br /><br />Also, like others, I felt that there really weren't many clusters as the picture on the product shows. The lack of larger clusters makes it harder to be a hand snack but you can still pour it in a cereal bowl and add milk.<br /><br />Previously I have enjoyed Kind products, so this experience won't prevent me from trying other Kind products. However, I may be hesitant to try this particular product again. I'll be glad to change my review though if Kind sends me another bag -- and it doesn't have that peculiar smell.

review/summary: Great Snack or Mixed with Yogurt
review/text: This is a great tasting granola that can be easily enjoyed by itself or as a great yogurt mixer which is how I always enjoy it.  It is lightly sweet with a great crunch.  On its own, I personally don't taste much of a blueberry flavor short of a very slight fruit tanginess.  Mixed in yogurt it is great because.  It gives a great granola flavor and crunch without adding an excessive amount of sweetness.

review/summary: Good for a snack or a cereal
review/text: This is a great product that can be eaten either as a snack or as a cereal. My husband and I tried it both ways. He is a bike rider and took some along with him for a snack on the trail and really like it. This particular package had the vanilla/blueberry clusters, and the taste was great.<br /><br />We also tried it as a cereal with almond milk and once with apple juice. It was great. I seemed to like it more than my husband. He said it wasn't sweet enough for a snack, but was great as a cereal. I liked it just fine either way and also ate it mixed with yogurt, which was great.<br /><br />The one drawback is that only 1/3 of a cup - a small serving - is 120 calories. This mostly comes from the high carbs of the many mixed grains like gluten free oats, brown rice, oat flour, buckwheat, and more. So it has a very high fiber content, which makes it a great healthy carb for active people. I like that it uses molasses as a sweetner, and has sea salt as well.<br /><br />This is a really healthy, nutritious, whole food kind of product, and we really enjoy it.
