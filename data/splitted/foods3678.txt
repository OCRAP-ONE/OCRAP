review/summary: Fruity, sweet matcha!
review/text: The smell of Brandy Matcha is really fruity and sweet - very much what Juicy Fruit gum smells like!  The taste is just as good! And don't bother adding any sweetener - this is sweet enough on its own!  The best part: There's no sugar in this matcha to begin with!<br /><br />I can't wait to mix this with an apple or dark berry matcha!

review/summary: The Matcha is Mine...
review/text: And the sailor said 'Brandy, you're a fine girl, what a good wife you would be..." Okay, so, that song is the only real reference to brandy I have, and that's not even the right brandy. Well, that song and the singer from the 90s...anyway. In college, one of my roommates liked to mix (cheap, horrible) brandy with her cola when she drank, and so I've had a few of those, but that's really it. I'm a whisky girl, through and through. That's what happens when you go to high school in Tennessee and college in Kentucky. But it looked interesting and I liked the brandy I've had, so I thought "why not?" If nothing else, it will be good for mixing with the apple matcha. Or the cola matcha, for when I'm having a bad day at work and need a drink but can't have one just yet. At least I can pretend. But I don't really have a flavor profile in mind when I try this matcha, so it will be an interesting experience. For instance, when I try a pineapple tea, I have in mind what I think a pineapple should taste like and I can match the tea up to that flavor profile and see how it compares. With this, I'm just shooting in the dark, though I'm sure I'll be comparing it to whisky before this review is done.<br /><br />Oh wow, this is good. This is goooood. Yes, the unnecessary "o"s were necessary. It's fruity and smooth and...yum. I don't quite know how to describe it. It's not what I was expecting out of brandy, but I don't really have any experience with brandy, so what do I know? I can almost taste a touch of alcohol, but that might just be my imagination. It does seem warming, which is odd since I'm drinking it cold. I love cold matcha and how easy it is to mix. Add water to matcha powder, whisk/froth, and go! Done! Yum. Saves me a ton of time in the mornings when I'm barely awake and trying to get ready for work.<br /><br />Anyway, yes. If this is what brandy tastes like, I need to try some as soon as possible. I think my father in law has some...it might be time to hang out with the in laws. It tastes kind of like bubble gum but...juicy fruit gum, not double bubble. Definitely one I plan to keep around.

review/summary: A rare bread.
review/text: I agree this bread could be a little better.  It is dry and it has to be toasted.  I hope that it is currently unavailable because they are making it better, but I hope not by adding something I can't eat.  Meanwhile I am breadless.  This is the only bread I've been able to find that has no milk, no gluten and no rice.

review/summary: Not their best
review/text: This flax seed bread is not the best product for Glutino. While it has a very good taste, especially toasted, it is dryer than their sandwich bread. Heating did not soften it but toasting did. The whole flax seeds are more difficult to digest than flax meal. I'd like to see Glutino improve on this recipe as I think the idea behind it is a good one. Great way to get my omega-3.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Cake Mix Yet!!
review/text: This is the first product from this brand I've tried.  To be honest, I usually make my own gluten free cakes, being that gf mixes can be iffy.  I've tried both from "Betty Crocker" (yellow and devil's food).  I attempted to make the chocolate one from "Bob's Red Mill" but couldn't get past the nasty smell (from the pea flour?), so I didn't even bother to cook it!<br /><br />  Before I bought this mix, I checked out the website first.  Here's what they list:<br />"ORGANIC DEHYDRATED SUGAR CANE JUICE, ORGANIC RICE FLOUR, POTATO FLOUR, ORGANIC COCOA POWDER, ORGANIC CASSAVA STARCH, ORGANIC SORGHUM FLOUR, TEFF FLOUR, ARROWROOT STARCH, SEA SALT, BAKING SODA, XANTHAN GUM, VANILLA POWDER, BAKING POWDER, GUAR GUM.  Ingredients are 75% Organic by weight"  (There's a nutritional label as well, but I can't copy/paste.)<br /><br />  The 2 recipes included on the back of the bag are for using the whole bag for many cookies, and multiple cakes.  However, if you go to the website, you will find recipes for normal sized portions (I believe all call for 2 1/2 cups mix-- whether it be cake, cookies, brownie, etc.)  I followed the cake recipe cited, and put it in a bunt pan.  For a richer option, I added sour cream (the recipe online says you can add 6 oz. of dairy or soy cream cheese), and decreased the water amount to about 3/4 cup (instead of the called 1 cup).  The consistency wasn't as heavy as I expected, but still satisfying.  There is no grit to it either (some mixes add corn meal)!!  I also like the fact that it has more healthy flours like Teff, and Sorghum!<br /><br />Those that have an allergy to corn or soy ingredients are sure to appreciate this!  Plus there are "vegan" options to the online recipes!<br /><br />In conclusion, if you love chocolate, or are just looking for a tasty gluten-free cake mix-- look no further than "Mina's Purely Divine Chocolate Baking Mix"!!  (FYI, there are 2 other mixes; an "all purpose", and "bread mix".)

review/summary: Easy, reliable.
review/text: My only tweak to the super-simple cake recipe on the website was the addition of 1) 1/4 cup high-quality dark chocolate, for a deeper chocolate flavor, and 2) 1/2 cup nonfat Greek yogurt.  The cake turned out beautifully -- moist and flavorful.  Rice flour in the mix gives the texture a slightly delicate quality, but not so delicate as to cause crumbling. In my experience, gluten-free baking mixes often have a cornmealy, metallic, or milky (whey protein) taste -- none of which I detected here. Highly recommended if you've already tried the major brands (like Bob's Red Mill or Pamela's).

review/summary: A lovely array of spices and a nice, traditional flavour.
review/text: This is a really lovely panforte with a hint of cardamom that, while uncommon, is a really nice flavour.  Panforte has no one single recipe. Each shop in Siena makes its own, and their recipes are closely guarded secrets. There's no way to say "this Sienese panforte isn't authentic," since there are so many varieties. This is the traditional Margherita panforte, which is the most common to be found. Think of it as the 'regular' panforte with other options being nero (dark) or panforte biano (white), etc, etc. Again, each local shop in Siena may make three to six different variations of panforte, and their recipes will be different from the shop next door. Similar, but slightly different uses of spices or fruits.<br /><br />I ordered this panforte because, living in Siena, where panforte originates, I really became addicted to the stuff, and have been trying ever since leaving to find a good solution to my cravings. Sienese panforte is a very local tradition that doesn't extend too much outside of Tuscany in any great variety, and the variants we get all seem to lack in one very important aspect: thickness. This is no exception, and for that, I've removed a star.  Most of the panforte you find in Siena is a couple of inches thick and cut as slices from a giant 'pie.'  These are far thinner and smaller, but no less delicious.

review/summary: Millstone Caramel Truffle Decaf - Great
review/text: Was recently told to use decaf coffee as much as possible. Have tried many brands but there are only a few varieties available in stores that are not strong enough to remove paint!!! We are not all espresso drinkers & don't like using knives & forks for our coffee. We purchased Millstones Caramel Truffle decaf at the grocers (Cub & Coborns) many times - then they both quit carrying it. The only place I've found it is at Amazon.com & it is worth the wait for delivery. Excellent for those of us who can't have caffeine.

review/text: I have liked this sauce for as long as I can remember.  I use it on steaks, chops, chicken and even to eat French fries or tater tots.  I even use it as a basting sauce for sausages or meat on the grill.  I like some steaks plain but this sauce just adds zing to any kind of meat.<br /><br />Sometimes I mix in some Frank's Red Hot sauce to even make it hotter to use when grilling out.  It is also a great addition to barbeque wings mixed with Buffalo Sauce. We also pressure cook pork or beef and shred it for pulled meat sandwiches and this flavor just sets it off.<br /><br />* Ribs<br />* Sausage<br />* Steaks<br />* Shrimp<br />* Hamburger for tacos<br />* Hamburger sandwiches<br />* French fries, onion rings or tater tots<br />* Chicken wings<br />* It has 100's of uses<br /><br />It does contain a lot of salt at 200 mg and 8% of your daily allotment for just one tablespoon.  It also has 4 grams of sugar. I love it as my favorite steak sauce and I recommend it to you.

review/text: This is my go-to drink when I feel like drinking something refreshing on a hot summer day.  I am not a huge fan of strongly flavored tea drinks, but I really enjoy this one because of the mango component.  It achieves a good balance of sweetness and tea flavor; one does not overpower the other.  I was worried that this drink might taste too much like their "Mucho Mango" beverage (which is far too sweet for me), but was pleasantly surprised when its wasn't nearly as strong.  The price point is unbeatable and the tea is delicious!

review/summary: Vegans Beware: Has Sugar
review/text: This item is listed as vegan, but the list of ingredients is not visible in the image, and the ingredients is not listed on Amazon. I contacted the company to send me the information on a few sauces. They have sugar in them, though they are labelled vegan. The company rep wrote that, "All of the sauces you are interested are vegan, it contains no dairy product, meat or seafood. However, all cooking sauces contain sugar." This is obviously a contradiction to many, if not most vegans.<br /><br />I write this as an FYI to those wanting to find a vegan sauce. My daughter just turned vegan and needs an stir fry sauce without sugar or with organic sugar or other sweetener, so I felt I was almost tricked into buying this, but she would have been upset.<br /><br />I gave it only one star because of this misrepresentation.

review/summary: Hoping this is the same coffee as the two pack they sell (packaging looks a little different)
review/text: UPDATE FOR 01/2012<br /><br />Guys:<br />I've already bought the two-pack version of this coffee (Mastro Lorenzo Crema Coffee, T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 2)) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZOFZW2">Mastro Lorenzo Crema Coffee, T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 2)</a>whose packaging appears to look a little different and is not available with the "subscribe and save" option (it comes out to about $11 a pack), but this is a better deal if you use the Subscribe and Save (about $9.35/pack or .59 per disk, and it's still the same coffee made by Mastro and imported from Germany).  Please note that some consider this still to be realtively pricey because it only produces a short European style cup of cofee (about 4 oz).  Also note that there is a Tassimo version of this coffee (also a short cup with a crema called Carte Noir Voluptuoso<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M8KWYU">Carte Noir Voluptuoso, 16-Count T-Discs for Tassimo Brewers (Pack of 3)</a>) that's  cheaper, but it's not nearly as tasty and rich as the Mastro Lorenzo is to me.<br /><br />I've never seen this coffee sold locally in NY, but then again, it seems that most of the supermarkets and appliance stores are giving more shelf space to the more popular k-cup machines and coffees.  Anyway, back to Mastro Crema....... the coffee comes shipped in the original European packaging (there's a leaflet attached in English), but everything else is the same as the other  t-discs sold in the states.  Like I mentioned above, the coffee is "european" style , so it's only about 4 oz and quite dark and rich with a wonderful thick crema on top.  If you want a larger cup, you can always press the manual button and have it come out a bit lighter (still quite good), but I prefer the original amount.  This coffee is very similar to the regular coffee I had every morning at a coffee bar in Barcelona.  Very, very good and hard to tell it comes from a tassimo non-pressurized machine. In fact, I prefer this over the larger dark brews I've used in the past (e.g., $tarbuck$).....the subscribe and save makes this a pretty good deal even though the price of the disk went up from up from .43/cup when I ordered in mid 2011).<br /><br />If you like your coffee rich, dark, creamy with a nice roasted flavor but not "burnt", this is the one.

review/summary: Tastes "burned"
review/text: I was looking for a caffeinated interim substitute for the Gevalia Espresso pods that are recalled/back-ordered/out-of-stock/overpriced at the moment.  Even though it isn't espresso, I thought we'd try this since some reviewers said it was more like European coffee (which is actually just espresso).  My husband has worked at Starbucks for many years. He took one sip and made a bad face.  He said it tasted like the beans had been over-roasted and the shot over-extracted. Well, I guess he's stuck with three packs of this because we can't return to two unopened packages! Bummer. Here's hoping the Gevalia espresso is back in stock once he's through those 48 t-discs.

review/summary: Still staying with tassimo!!!!
review/text: I was a little upset when Starbucks left and Gevalia couldn't even compare to it.  I knew Starbucks was going to leave at one point but didn't know when so as we all know or heard that Starbucks have their beans a little more roasted than others(a llittle burnt than a dark roast) but in a good way that's what gives them a distinctive taste.  So as I ventured out Lorenzo creama is my first choice bold, smooth, light, not a burnt taste, a little sweet and a little creamy after taste...overall I love it..it brews a nice size cup for the American it is small.....I like to have my coffee black that is how you can distinguish the different taste and flavors kind of like wine tasting....second choice would be Carte Noire Voluptuoso a little lighter than the Lorenzo but still bold, more smooth and a sweeter after taste overall it's good.  Jacobs on the other hand has the lightest of taste as it brews a medium to light roast with a little fruitiness in it but yes to me it's okay feels like I'm having a cup of decaf compared to the others.

review/text: I was buying the Starbucks line till they lasted.  But I mostly liked the capp/latte blends as I personally thought the other products including breakfast blend were too acidic and overwhelmed the taste.  The Mastro Lorenzo Crema is a great find!  It brews perfect amount in one of my smaller italian cups.  I usually add a bit of cream or milk to it to make it taste a little smoother.  I don't think you could go wrong.  Again, it won't make a full size American cup.  But I don't like to linger with a full cup as I have to go back and microwave big mug fills and that just kills the taste.  Give it a try.

review/summary: Good but not great! 3 Stars - Here's why!
review/text: Carte Noir Expresso vs Mastro Lorenzo vs Starbucks -<br /><br />COMPARING the Mastro Lorenzo Espresso vs Carte Noir Expresso line, currently offered by Tassimo.<br /><br />Since I rated the Carte Noir Expresso (3.5) higher than the Mastro Lorenzo Espresso (3.0), here are the highlights for the Carte Noir instead:<br /><br />* It has a somewhat Hearty and almost Fruity' undertones, with almost no bitterness to complain about.<br /><br />* It's very low-acidic; but, then again, for an Espresso, it is not a true bold coffee, but yet it does deliver a very smooth full bodied flavor.<br /><br />* Unfortunately the Crema on the Carte Noir is weak/thin and the espresso comes out with a medium rather than rich, bold body.<br /><br />* You get 4 oz shot of caffeine<br /><br />* Compared to the `Mastro Lorenzo Espresso Intenso', I prefer the Carte Noir, based on Taste & Character.<br /><br />* Compared to StarBucks ... Note this ... There is NO Comparison! StarBucks is a 5-Star Product, which unfortunately, is MOSTLY, no longer available for the Tassimo-Bosch units, except by some Coyotes attempting to Cash in, on the less informed.<br />Tassimo<br /><br />* UPDATE - Starbucks has just announced a NEW compact relationship with the Keurig line of coffeemakers, it looks like I will be purchasing a New Coffeemaker over the Holidays, or perhaps Santa will bring me a Keurig Christmas present ... for being mostly Naughty & a little Nice!

review/text: 5 stars along with the others. I think the small cup size is exactly what it should be. Coffee this flavorful should be tasted and not drunk in great draughts. Moreover it cools more rapidly than thin American coffees and loses much of its flavor accordingly as well as the effect of the crema. I like the fact that I can drink this coffee unthinned with milk. I'm not searching any further and just moving up to the 3 pack.

review/summary: Best Homemade coffee!
review/text: I have to say, the Mastro Lorenze Crema is the best homemade coffee I ever had. Heck, it's the best I've had, home or commercial, period. It's kind of a mix between espresso and regular coffee, combining the taste strengths of each. The "Americano" ,which I guess you can compared it to, tastes too watered down to me. It's funny, but i kinda look forward to it on weekend mornings and I look with regret at my tassimo machine at night. I just love coffee for its taste.<br /><br />I like to drink my coffee straight black, no cream, no sugar, no bs stuff. I am of the thought that this is the only way you can credit or discredit the quality of the coffee, regardless of your preference. I hear people talk about coffee quality when they drink it mixed with cream, milk, etc, so it annoys me a little bit. I am not saying they can't enjoy their coffee that way, but to me, it is no longer just coffee but a mixed drink to be judge differently. I do like to drink cold coffee beverages like Starbucks frapuccino, but I can't really judge the quality of the coffee used, just the overall taste of the drink.<br /><br />Mastro Lorenzo Crema is a European style coffee, so it serves in a smaller quantity. After the machine is done, it smells a little burnt, but I believe it is coming from the cartridge. The coffee itself smells and taste great. If you actually drink your coffee straight, I am sure you won't regret it. If you like to mix it with cream or milk or something else, then just go with Maxwell house or whatever the cheapest is.

However I will list the plusses and minuses:<br />Plus: The light foam on top and the creamy texture made drinking this coffee fun; plus, the smell was yummy. The flavor was strong and consistent every time.<br />Minus: I had to add milk to the cup before I actually brewed the coffee. If you don't like pure Arabica coffee flavors, don't purchase this particular brand. The amount brewed is very small, and the caffeine content seems to be minimal so I had to drink at least two cups.

The 4 for about $30 isn't a bad price--not great, but we who are forced to go gluten free get used (a little) to being gouged. However, shipping is another $10!!! NO WAY!<br />Though I really enjoy the product I am not going to pay $10 each for a very small serving of lasagna.<br /><br />If you want to give it a try, I'd recommend you locate this product locally.

review/text: Let me start by saying that I am a huge Blair's fan.  I have most of his products, but this is my Go To sauce.  It enhances any dish or is great on a chip or cracker.  Pure Death is the most balanced and clean sauce he's producing right now.  It won't blow your head off, if that's what you're looking for, but the taste is wonderful.  The red salt is a nice compliment to the peppers and probably helps attain that bright orange color.  The flavor of the peppers really shines through.  Nice work, Blair.  Feel alive!!

review/summary: This sauce will delight your taste buds, but will not have you reaching for an extinguishing beverage.
review/text: This sauce delivers on flavor with a full-bodied, almost fruity taste. It will disappoint hot sauce enthusiasts who will be expecting at least a moderate burn from a sauce with Jolokia peppers. This is not a very hot sauce, falling well short of Tabasco's Habanero offering in terms of heat, and offering none of the punishing burn of the higher-tier Death sauces like Mega or Ultra Death, or Dave's. But you also don't get the bitter pepper-extract taste of those hotter sauces.

review/text: As other reviewers have pointed out, this sauce is not all that spicy, but it's spicy enough to be able to pour generous helpings all over everything and make it absolutely delicious! The only drawback of it not being hotter is that I go through it so quickly.<br /><br />It has a great, subtle flavor that doesn't overpower the flavor of the food. An excellent all-around hot sauce.

review/text: My daughter loves these snacks. They are tasty, and almost have the feeling of melting in your mouth. They are soft, not gooey like some other fruit snacks. We tried a few other brands when we couldn't find these in the store but she hated them, and I don't blame her, again very gummy, too gummy for a toddler. We reordered these off amazon and daughter and mommy are quite happy. The packs make it easy to grab one on the go with you. The different flavors are nice letting her taste a variety of flavors. They aren't cheap but at the same time, what baby food is cheap in price? Least I know she eats them and doesn't waste them and don't have to worry about her choking since they are not gummy like other brands.

review/text: One of our children has neurological brain damage and corn syrup is quite detrimental to her system. It causes temper tantrums, severe anger, and problems sleeping, just to name a few things that last 7-10 days after consumption. Corn Syrup Solids contain High Fructose Corn Syrup which is NOT a naturally occurring substance. I was shocked when I read the ingredient list and realized corn syrup was included in an *all-natural* snack for toddlers. I had ordered these for our daughter, and could not return them since they were a food item. Parents, please be careful what you feed your children!

There is nothing wrong with the quality and the flavor of the snacks but I am basically rating the price.  This is the price you'd expect to pay if you got them at a vending machine at a hospital or some luxury trip where they are hard to find.  If you can make it to the supermarket however, get them there; this is not worth it!

review/summary: This is NOT the same as the UK version of Alpen.
review/text: Let me get this out of the way:  Amazon shipped this to me quick and did a great job so this review is not their fault.<br /><br />I grew up in the UK and still have family that lives there that will send over Alpen Original whenever they can.  I had no idea until last week that you could even purchase Alpen in the US.<br /><br />I read the reviews and everyone says "this is great - just like I remembered".  Perhaps these people are used to the Canadian/North American version of this but let me assure you that this is NOT like the UK.<br /><br />This version is more like rasin bran + muesli. It has bran flakes and a different consistency.  It's not bad per se but just not at all what I expected.  The UK version is closer to oatmeal and muesli together.  This version doesn't soak up the milk quite the same but it does stay crunchier.<br /><br />Perhaps its always been this way but I won't be ordering this version anymore and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for the UK version.

review/summary: The Alpen I loved has changed...
review/text: Alpen in the red box was my absolute favorite cereal.  However, the box recently changed to brown, and along with that so did the taste.  I did some searching on the web, and confirmed what I found by comparing the ingredients:  they are no longer organic ingredients, and are listed in a different order.  The change took place in the UK a couple years ago and it has now happened here in the USA.  If the new taste doesn't grow on me, I will have to find another cereal.  I wonder if anyone else who purchases on Amazon has noticed the change.

So I'm not complaining as this is as good, but wanted the others to know. Since I have no choice, I'll keep ordering it, but if Amazon can get the UK version, that'd be great!

Alpen has a light sweet flavor to it and a wonderful consistency. The almonds and raisins are not overbearing (I normally don't like either in anything, but for some reason they are great in Alpen!).  I highly recommend this cereal. Add fresh fruit for added tastiness.

review/summary: BEWARE...NOT Alpen from UK...tastes like horse food...
review/text: I totally agree with Jeremy Lynnes. This is not the Alpen I grew up with in Scotland, nor is it the same Alpen the Brits are currently eating across the pond. As my cousin so aptly put it, "it tastes like horse food"-meaning it mostly tastes like raw oats. This Canadian version doesn't have much flavor to it at all, and since I stopped eating it, my husband (who likes everything) noted that it seems like all the sugar falls to the bottom of the box, so most of it isn't very sweet, then the last bowlful is too sweet.<br /><br />If you don't have the original to compare it to, its not very good; comparing it to the original...its very bad. I LOVE Alpen in the UK and brought a box back with me last summer, but this is nothing close...so sad.<br /><br />Note to Amazon:  Can you please carry the "REAL" Alpen? I promise I'll then write a 5 star review of the product! :)

review/summary: I believe everyone should try this, especially children.
review/text: This cereal is great on many different levels.  The most obvious is, I suppose, as a healthy food for, this cereal is packed with simple, delicious ingredients that haven't been loaded up with a plethora of chemicals and additives.  The top three ingredients are, in order: flakes of rolled whole oats, whole wheat and raisins.  The remaining ingredients for the most part add sweetness: brown sugar, skim milk powder and malt extract; but also barley, hazel nuts and almonds.  I list these ingredients to make it clear that although this cereal has sweetness on the level of a confection, it has come from a bunch of lightly processed whole grains, fruits and nuts.<br /><br />The relative sweetness of this cereal brings us to another level on which this cereal is great; the 'I can't outgrow my sweet tooth but I need to eat healthily' level.  Yup, that's correct, I too used to love Cap'n & Peanutbutter Crunch, Lucky Charms, and all manner of other sweet cereals and frankly, even the ones I could tolerate such as Kellog's Corn Flakes and Chex have loads of additional sugar, if I'm not mistaken.<br />The problem with them, apart from the fact that I really don't enjoy eating the most cloyingly sweet cereals any longer is that they don't seem to bring much to the table; they are kind of like empty calories and as we age it is increasingly difficult to find ways to effectively burn them off.<br />The beauty of this cereal is that even though it is sweet, the whole grains provide Lots of fiber.  Yup, that's right, this stuff moves right through one's bowels helping to ensure well, plenty of bowel movement.  As most of us who are lucky enough to ripen into old age are likely to develop some form of cancer it is foolish not to pay heed to the advice to consume a high fiber diet.<br /><br />On the domestic level, for those of us who would like to instill healthy eating habits into our children this cereal is a great way to expose them to something that may actually be better for them than the highly processed, sickly sweet cereals they are likely to crave.<br /><br />I was lucky to get such exposure at an early age when an older sister returned from Switzerland with a box of the stuff.  I thought it was a bit bizarre at the time but happily consumed it and the experience took so that as I grew older and began to search for a breakfast cereal alternative to the treacly sweet stuff this was an easy choice to make.  I believe that my childhood exposure to this cereal is what made this an easy choice. Although my go to cereal since adulthood has been shredded wheat sans sugar, when I get that craving for a sweet cereal, this stuff is the ticket.<br /><br />Buying this cereal through amazon in the large pack makes it surprisingly inexpensive and I think that if you get it you will be shocked to find how short a time it takes to go through it all.<br /><br />As a side note, this is an excellent take along on road trips where you know you won't be able to eat a lot of fiber easily.  I'm thinking that on a business trip little distracts one more from the business at hand than a bout of constipation from having one's normal routines upended.

I add milk at home and when I get to work 10 minutes later it's still got some liquid and is a bit softer but still has a nice crunch. I add a few extra raisins and sometimes some other dried fruit. I tried the no sugar added variety but that's a bit too dull for me. Have tried a couple other mueslis (mueslii?) but nothing compares to Alpen. Only downside is the small boxes but with Subscribe & Save I'm never out of my most favorite cereal.

review/summary: Healthy breakfast cereal
review/text: I discovered this cereal while in Ireland last summer.  I could not find locally at grocers or health food stores and Amazon had the best deal.<br />The best value is to sign up for regular shipment. Great taste, cold or hot.

review/summary: Best Muesli Ever
review/text: This gem of a cereal from England is so hard to find in the US - and if you do find it it's outrageously expensive. This 6-pack was great value. If you've never tried Alpen before and are a muesli fan give it a go, it's the best.
