review/summary: YUM
review/text: I didn't buy this product off Amazon (sorry, guys!) but I normally buy it at school for a quick and mostly healthy snack in between classes. I'm surprised at all the negative reviews. I am a very picky eater and I really like these bars. They  satisfy my craving for something sweet while still being healthy. I also love the fact that one bar really fills me up, as it normally takes 2 fruit or granola bars to do the same.

review/summary: Love these bars!
review/text: I discovered these bars some time ago at my local grocery store - they were on this little display with some other things. The next time I went there, I couldn't find them. And I couldn't really remember what they were called. So, I was very excited when I saw them at Starbucks probably a year later. They are, of course, way too expensive there! I wasn't able to find them reliably anywhere around town, so I found them online and now I have two boxes (two different flavors) auto-shipped to me from Amazon. Now I have begun to see these in stores more often so I've been trying some other flavors.<br /><br />I used to eat Kashi cereal each morning but now I have one of these bars with my requisite Dr. Pepper. I'm not sure how long ago I changed my breakfast choice, but I have lost about 15 pounds (that needed to be lost) since I changed over to the bars. I definitely didn't change earlier than November, 2010. And, instead of being starving at 11 a.m., I don't get seriously hungry until later.*<br /><br />* These claims have not been evaluated by anyone, and no animals have been tortured to prove them.

review/text: The bar is a sticky mess inside a wrapper that can't be pulled away from the "bar".  The flavor is good, but much of the contents remain stuck to the wrapper.  If you do manage to pull the wrapping away, the contents sag and fall apart.  I have had other Kind bars and liked them, but will not buy this variety again.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: Nuts. 500mg of Omega-3. The package has all the appeal of an average healthy snack bar. It also touts Non GMO ingredients, and they donate 5% of their profits to PeaceWorks Foundation. Bonus. So, I picked up a few on close-out at my local grocer.<br /><br />Made in Australia, stored on a shelf, put on close-out, and traveled around in my bag for awhile... not even close to expiration, but still... it has been around.  I expected a mediocre nut bar. Not so. It's so good I felt compelled to look online for more.<br /><br />Looking over the ingredients list, nothing stands out as "The Flavor" that makes these so tasty, so I'll just leave it at that. Simple, sweet and soft, crunchy and flavorful. I wish I would have bought the rest of the ones I saw on close-out. These are good.

Unlike the bars I have purchased locally, the bar cannot be extracted from the wrapper intact; they stick to the wrapper as if they had not been kept in a cool dry place.  Except for the annoyance of peeling them off by pieces from the wrapper, they are still quite tasty.

review/text: I've only eaten the KIND bar once, and it was definitely not this flavor but I didn't realize it until I opened it up and tasted it.  I love mango. I love macadamia. But in this bar, together, they are not great.  It's not bad... just not my cup of tea. The mango is a little too artificial and I don't get the macadamia crunch so I would say try another flavor.

review/text: I am gluten-free and dairy-free, so there are not a lot of "on the go" food choices.  Some, like the Lara bars, are really dense and don't resemble real food.  The Kind bars however taste fresh with a nice mix of flavors.  The Cranberry Almond is my favorite, followed closely by the Almond Apricot.  They are resilient enough to be carried around in my purse for "food emergencies".  They get a little flat, but hold up much better than a banana and still taste great.  Good price on Amazon, I pay over $20/box at local stores.

review/summary: Healthy Candy Bar!
review/text: Of all the KIND bars (and I've had them all) this one will hit the spot if you're craving the taste and texture of caramel and nuts. What's nice is that the fat content is relatively low for something that really can qualify as a comfort snack, while the nuts and other unprocessed goodies will give you sustained energy and the important OMGA-3.<br /><br />I've removed all the junk snacks from our home and put in boxes of KIND Bars; this one is the one I have to restock most often. If you're curious, go to your local health food store and pay $2.00 for a single bar; I promise you'll be back here ordering it by the box.

review/summary: Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants
review/text: First got turned onto these bars at Starbucks. Our favorite is the blueberry vanilla & cashew but Amazon does not offer this combo for some reason. So I ordered the  Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants as well as another type, figuring that even if the kids did not like it my husband would take the remainders to work to snack on midday. Well no one likes this flavor. It consists of a lot of the puffed filler grains used in cheap bars, almost like smaller firmer rice crispies. I even had the box in the car to pull out when the kids were starving as a snack but no go and husband doesn't like them. The other kind I ordered was the fruit and nut delight which everyone will eat, but our favorite remains the blueberry vanilla and cashews.

In my opinion, it's too sweet (while I occasionally indulge in sweet things, this isn't what I had expected with this product). Every bar is 40g and there are 13g of sugar. Yikes. I wish I had looked this up before I purchased this because I have nine more bars. What's worse, instead of getting twelve bars, my box only came with ten. I will not be ordering this or any other Kind bars.

review/text: Almost every breakfast/snack bar is plastered with claims that it's "satisfying" and "nutritious."  Ironically, the exact opposite is usually the case:  the bar amounts to a couple of bites of chemical-laden chalk comprised of over-processed protein isolate and corn syrup.  These KIND bars are one of the only available bars on the market that actually ARE delicious, nutritious, and filling.<br /><br />I'm a chocolate and peanut butter fiend, and before I discovered KIND bars, I had abandoned my years-long quest for a bar that contained chocolate and peanut butter without being a glorified candy bar devoid of nutritive value.  I have one almost every day for breakfast, and for hours afterward I feel both satisfied and energetic, in contrast to the jittery 30-minute sugar rush followed by a swift crash provided by other brands.

review/summary: Ki Almond Plus Cranberry and Almond Bars
review/text: I think this bar is exceptional because it contains such large pieces of nuts, even whole almonds, and cranberries.<br />This is a great "take along" snack as long as it is kept somewhat cool. If too warm it is somewhat sticky and hard to remove from the wrapper.

review/summary: Nice snack that lasts!
review/text: This bar has cranberries, almonds, and macadamia nuts (NOT bits and pieces!) as their main ingredients, in a soft honey-like glaze to keep it all together.  I refrigerate them in the summer or they kind of "wilt".  The ingredients are fresh, and the nuts are crunchy.  What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them.  Those nuts are meant to be chewed and not inhaled, unlike a lot of snacks that disappear as soon as you get the wrapper off.  I can't eat one in front of my favorite dog, as this is one snack I am too fond of to share with her... much to her dismay.  I think they are worth the cost, and I know they cost way more if you find them in a local grocery store.

review/summary: the Peanut bar
review/text: I was looking forward to receiving this order. Almonds, macadamias, and walnuts! Sounded delicious.<br />Then I tried one, and was puzzled. Yes, I could taste some almond, but WOW, the  main flavor was PEANUTS. The ingredients list peanuts as the largest amount of nuts. This should be called the Peanut, Almond Bar. If one likes to have the main flavor of a nut bar as peanuts, you will enjoy this.<br />The quality of KIND products I appreciate, as well as the low GI, the natural properties, and having a healthier choice. But honesty in advertising and product would be appreciated.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the deception, and the unexpectedly strong flavor of peanuts, as I purchased it for the nuts I like best, which were supposed to be the main source of nut protein.<br />Let's get honest KIND!

review/summary: Changed Formula
review/text: These were a staple for my gluten-free teenager until a few months ago when she started complaining that they tasted different, not in a good way.  We found out that the company has moved to a new factory/producer and that the formula has changed in some ways.  The flavor is not as fresh and tastes more like processed food. We are really disappointed and are hoping that the company can somehow find its way back to making really great bars.

review/summary: Delicious and nutricious!
review/text: I like protein bars conceptually - something to grab as you rush out - I go to a lot of 6 pm meetings,  and plan to eat dinner when they end,  but by then I'm ravenous,  and I need something to hold me through them.  So I've tried a lot of bars and frankly they range around mediocre,  pretending to be something (chocolate!)that they are clearly not.<br /><br />So what are these bars like?  Great!  Really delicious - full of nuts you can see and taste,  not too sweet,  as often these bars are, and it has protein!  A happy find,  we bought a box and will buy more,  I can see it becoming a staple in our cupboards.<br /><br />May 2010 - on to my third order,  so this is a really great snack in our house.  The protein really does help fill you up,  it's a perfect snack,  and all of us think it's delicious (though my son does prefer the macadamia passionfruit, this one has protein and that makes it a much better bar for me and my husband and our low sugar tendencies)

They serve as a total meal replacement when I'm on the go, but still taste good enough to be considered a snack.  I have now also tried the cranberry/almond (which are tasty, but sticky enough that I have learned not to eat them in the car)and the Vanilla Blueberry Granola and Cinnamon Oat Cereal as well.  These are GREAT products and I recommend them highly.  I've never written a review for anything before, but "Kind" words needed to be said!!!

review/text: My daughter and I have Celiac Disease and in our experience, lunch is the hardest meal of the day. When we are at home we are fine, but when we are at work or school, it is either difficult to find safe Gluten Free food or a clean enough location in which to eat that food without contaminating it by all the meals previously eaten there. We try to carry our lunch when possible, but we rely on safety net foods such as the Kind Plus Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate and Protein Bars to save us in a pinch or help us have energy to get home.

review/summary: Fabulous option for on-the-go snacks for those who eat Gluten Free!
review/text: I used to regularly grab various brands of granola and meal replacement bars when I was too busy to eat a proper meal, but since becoming gluten intolerant I have found myself at a loss for what to purchase.  Even seemingly innocent products would have hidden ingredients waiting to make me feel miserable.  Anyone who is gluten intolerant (or is allergic, or has Celiac) knows how frustrating it can be to find convenient foods, despite the growing number of food producers who are aware and clearly mark their packaging as "gluten free".<br /><br />Then, thanks to the bride at a recent wedding I photographed, I found Kind bars.  The almond-cranberry ones were the type she offered me as a snack while the bridesmaids were getting ready, and I found them to be a fabulous mix of flavors and have a very palatable texture (perhaps a bit on the dry side, but it's a nut bar, so have something to drink handy).  The amount of fiber and protein in these bars is quite filling even with the small portion size, and there are no worries about sugar drops thanks to the low-glycemic recipe.<br /><br />I highly recommend these to not just those who are gluten intolerant, but also for anyone who wants a healthy on-the-go snack that will actually sustain you until your next meal.  So far I haven't been disappointing by any flavors I've tried and just ordered a few I haven't seen anywhere in stores and look forward to reviewing those as well.

review/summary: If you like sticky, you'll LOVE this product
review/text: I've ordered a number of different kinds of "Kind" bars and "Kind Plus" bars before.<br /><br />These Cranberry Almond + Antioxidents Kind Plus bars are, by far, the most sticky I have ever had!  The wrapping sticks to the product, the product sticks to your fingers, and pretty soon, you're a bit messy.  You really need a wet-wipe for this product.<br /><br />The product itself is quite delicious, however, so just know that while it's yummy and crunchy and chewy, you'd do yourself a favor by knowing about the stickiness ahead of time.  Oh, and don't get it in your hair or in your child's hair by accident!

review/summary: My husband and mother have raided my stash!
review/text: I bought these for myself. Running around mommy and working I don't eat because I don't have time. Then my steam runs out and I think "why the hell didn't I eat?" My mom is a type 1 diabetic and she found these and now she can't keep her hands off of them. She said she doesn't feel hungry as quick. Now my husband has found them. Geez! I have had one package that was a little more gooey but most of the time they are drier tasting. Personally I don't want it to be gooey. I am on a subscription of these through Amazon and I need to increase the amount. My kids haven't tried them...I am sure they are next except they are picky eaters.

review/summary: Tasty, but like others better
review/text: This is a tasty bar, but as it contains chocolate it isn't great for all occasions, like a breakfast snack, and to me isn't chocolatey enough to satisfy those type of dessert cravings.<br />It's still WAY better than other healthy chocolate fruit/nut bars.

review/text: I love these bars. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is their price. I tried to save money by buying them here instead of store but it turns out the difference in price is nearly irrelevant.... Cheaper but not as much as you would think.anyway taste and quality is great.

review/summary: Get Your Fiber the Pleasant Way
review/text: I knew nothing about Kind Bars, until I saw them on QVC. Since I must be on a high fiber diet due to a colon problem, I tried them. After the first box, I was "hooked". These are the best tasting fiber bars I've ever had. The ones in the markets are good, but Kind Bars are the best. I use them as a once a day snack or desert. If I use it as a snack, I follow with 8 oz., water. I feel as satisfied as if I had a full meal. My favorite is almonds and cranberry. They are not too sweet, but just right for my taste. Another thing that I like about them is, they are moist and the nuts are easy to chew, not hard. If you like nuts, cranberries and honey, you'll love Kind Bars. MAK

review/summary: Very tasty bars
review/text: There are many varieties of bars on the market these days.  I like Kind Plus and tried several varieties.  They have almonds, not peanuts as other brands have and this makes a big difference.  They taste grate and very fulfilling.  Each bar still has 12 gram of sugar, so be careful and do not eat too many at once, but one a day as between meals snack is OK : )

review/summary: Wonderful Breakfast Bar!!
review/text: These bars are great - and I am not even particularly fond of cranberries. They are not overly sweet (I can't quite stomach chocolate early in the morning), but provide a good, solid start to the day. They are my favorite breakfast bar right now, and for those who do like cranberries, you will love these.

Because I wanted to have a box of this flavor only (not a variety pack), I ordered these bars. Great flavor and they feel "so healthy." Give tham a try. You won't be sorry.

review/summary: best ever snack or breakfast bars
review/text: These bars taste good and have all the right things in them (like almonds and cranberries, etc) that let you know they are doing your body good.  These bars were better tasting than other snacks I have eaten.  They are packed with good stuff that help keep your blood sugar balanced (I am hypoglycemic with fibromyalgia and a few other mechanical issues) and your energy stays up there.  This may have me making it a major part of my daily regime. These bars keep actually full me up for a while too.  They come in a smaller size which I am going to get just to stick in my purse for those sugar drops that leave you shaking and dizzy!! and of course for fighting those hunger pangs between meals.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: I generally dislike most "healthy" bars mainly because they don't taste particularly good.  Like bars are different, they are truly tasty! Well at least the cranberry almond and the almond cashew with flax bars I have tried are amazing.  I am more than happy to snack on them rather than a chocolate bar or other snack, they are that good!
