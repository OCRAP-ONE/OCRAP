review/text: I got the right amount of cereal for the money. However, the Mini Wheats, which is the only high fiber / healthy choice, has 3 boxes out of the total 30.  Each packet has about half of the baggie however all the others that are high in sugar are full to the core.<br /><br />I was very disappointed with this purchase.  Will NEVER purchase again.  For those that like high sugary cereals and aren't looking for fiber this is the perfect choice for you.

The cereals that I got were for children and I have none of those at home. They shouldn't be posting pictures that are not what you get.<br /><br />I decided to keep the box since the postage to return it was more than the box itself.<br /><br />I guess if you ship it to someone you'll never hear a complaint.  I had planned on eating these for breakfast, so now I snack on them sometimes.

review/summary: Mon's Foods, not "Healthy Cuisine"
review/text: It's edible, although some of the "seeds" in it look suspiciously hostile, owing to the usual crazy production worker putting a few things in on his or her own. So, does the definition of "kosher" include leaving possibly hostile objects in the mix? I ordered five of these spaghetti specials, and all five boxes have the same crack on the side, meaning that sending this group of products to me was malicious and intentional on the part of the proprieter.<br /><br />Oh, wow, I didn't know you could make "kosher" spaghetti that is this odd tasting, and the "vegetarian" meatballs, with their dried egg whites, are, shall I say, cutting it close for serious vegetarians.<br /><br />But, you have to love the gadget they use for shipping: It's a polystyrene brick with frozen carbon dioxide infused into it, all the advantages of dry ice without the immediate frostbite from contact. If they used a matching thin polystyrene package liner, they could keep the humidity out of the packaging and the package contents would arrive at their destination dry instead of soaking wet.<br /><br />As mentioned in the title, the company that manufactures this frozen food is called Mon Cuisine. And, believe it or not, some of Mon's products are moderately palatable, and I intend to order again.

review/text: My parents bought one of the carousel holders and after I saw it I knew I wanted something nicer for them. I went on Amazon of course and found this. It's a heavier duty quality then I expected and the design is nice and fits their gourmet kitchen a lot better then the cheap looking holders they sell in the stores. If you are looking for a holder def give this a look. The only VERY minor adjustment in design would be to adjust how the legs attach because they don't allow the cups to always fit totally snug, but that's only if u have it sitting up on the stand.

review/text: Works very well and looks really nice hanging on the wall. Much more attractive than the carousal type holders. Some of the cups do pop out with the rack hanging up, but I think that is due to slight variations in the k-cup designs.

review/text: This is a MUCH better option than shoving all my k-cups in one box, or keeping the individual boxes, or having a carousel that takes up counter space.  The black storage rack is solid and well made and the wrought iron effect, with the scrolls on the side, fits nicely with my decor.  I mounted mine horizontally to the wall behind my Keurig and filled it up with k-cups.  Not all k-cups are made the same, some are a little narrower than others and don't fit snugly in the rack...but even those did not fall out, they tilted slightly back and stayed put.<br /><br />I recommend this, you won't be disappointed.

For my taste, the Tchibo Exclusive Decaf is the best decaf ground I have ever brewed. I am very welling to pay the price and shipping to have a cup or two in the evenings.When coming back from a visit to Germany, or when friends come to the States, we ask they bring some coffee with them, Tchibo bitte.

review/text: I love white mochas, but at 4 bucks a pop at the cafe and goodness knows how many calories -- its an occational treat.  Enter this very creamy and delicious mix from Ghirardelli.  This mix is WONDERFUL!  It contains no trans fats, no high-fructose corn syrup, and each serving of powder has only 90 calories AND NO FAT!!!  It even contains the coffee, but I also add a bit of powdered espresso for an extra kick.  I like being able to control the milk fat content and don't have to worry about harmful additives.<br /><br />ANOTHER PLUS:  It is such an inexpensive way to enjoy a White Mocha!  At 22 servings for under 6 bucks + cost of milk, each white mocha is less than a dollar!  This mix is ideal for keeping in your office.

Add too little and there's no flavor at all, add more and it gets way too sweet, it's like adding pure sugar with a very mild coffee flavor and no detectable white chocolate flavor. It's not horrible, just not very good either.<br /><br />The Ghirardelli double-chocolate flavor is better (if you like chocolate of course), but even that is nothing special, they really seem to just be cashing in on the good reputation of other Ghirardelli products with these - honestly any brand, even the "Great Value" Wal-Mart store brand is just about as good and at a much lower price.

review/summary: A Grand Deception
review/text: In the world of canned soup products, I find Wolf Gang Puck's line to be a much needed respite from the testosterone-fueled, protein-worshiping Chunkys of the world that are a constant reminder we are still living in a warrior society dominated by an evolutionarily justified masculine self-view of physical gender hegemony. So you can imagine how thrilled I was to see Mr. Puck has delved into the realm of American home cookin'.<br /><br />However, upon opening the can I was greeted with the unfriendly face of disappointment. The dumplings, uninspired cubes of flavorless dough, embodied the confinement felt by many of us who yearn for liberation from  mass-produced culinary conformity. The broth's thickness belied its lack of substance--a trope of uncondensed soups better fitted for a Progresso "Italian" "Wedding" or Campbell's "Selects" (I suspect they are selecting from the bottom of the proverbial, and sometimes literal, in the case of food, barrel) "Cream" of "Chicken."<br /><br />Ultimately, the can, with its prevailing superimposed bust of the supposed head chef, says it all. The superego, dazzled by the lustrous allure of capitalism, has superseded the ego, and the id is left wanting.<br /><br />But add a little Tabasco and it's pretty good for a quick lunch.

On the bright side though (being stuck with a case), I do have a great opportunity to experiment with some of those free Penzey's spice samples and use up some of the overabundance of summer veggies to make this stuff edible.

It still beats Campbells, but for one fatal flaw, I simply can't recomend it anymore: this reformulation has the WORST dumplings ever.  They're hard, rubbery, flat slices off a larger "dumpling stick." The texture isn't entirely different from octopus or a really dense soy.<br /><br />Overall do I like it? Yes.

review/text: I bought this to give it a try b/c I can't find Swanson's Chicken & Dumplings anywhere (except at another internet grocer). It's by Wolfgang Puck, a world-famous chef, so it has to be good, right? Wrong. It is quite flavorless and has a very thin, watery consistency, which is not what I would expect of chicken & dumplings. Plus, they're stingy w/ the amount of chicken in there, and I must have missed the dumplings, b/c I was wondering where they were.  I actually went back to look at the can to make sure that it was supposed to be "chicken & dumplings." It's a pretty insubstantial soup. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not good enough to buy again. Frankly I'm surprised Mr. Puck isn't embarrassed to have his name attached to this product.

review/summary: Like others have mentioned. This soup is mediocre.
review/text: Saw this on the store shelf recently after not seeing Wolfgang Puck soups available for purchase in a long time. The previous red label non "organic" version of this soup was one of the best I've tasted. I remember the broth being thick and creamy, the dumplings had perfect texture and size. The chicken pieces were white and well portioned. It was a great soup. This version however is watered down with minuscule portions of ingredients. The chicken pieces are tiny dark slivers. There are more carrots in this soup than anything else. The dumplings are the most confusing part because they are tiny little hard squares. Can you even call them dumplings? The broth/water of the soup is completely flavorless. This isn't soup but more like some rationed gruel from a WW2 prison camp. It really is that terrible.<br /><br />I used to love Wolfgang Puck soups but I won't buy them again after this. It's too bad. I have no idea what they were thinking when they made this version.

review/summary: Wolfgang Puck Organic Soup - Chicken & Duplings
review/text: I purchased this very very pricy soup on sale at my local Publix in their Greenwise section.  It's typically $3.99 per can, but I caught a sale.  I bought just one can to give it a try.<br /><br />I agree with many of the other reviewers' comments, but I have a different take...He should be ashamed to put his name on this can.<br /><br />I found 4 bits of what was passing as dumplings, 4 bits of celery, 3 chunks of what looked like processed canned chicken cubes, bits of carrots, lots of white potato, water, water, water, and more water.<br /><br />I didn't need to eat it with a spoon because I could have poured it into a glass and drank it--very watery.  The soup is not at all similair to the label which has hearty chunky ingredients like a stew.<br /><br />The flavor was mild and not half bad, but the quality control for such a pricy soup should be better.  I expected more gourmet for my money than I would have with most commercial brands that you can buy at the dollar store.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Nice packaging<br />Packing made from recycled materials<br />Organic<br />Minimal preparation--heat and eat quickly<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Lacks flavor<br />Poor ingredients<br />High sodium content 680 mg.<br />7 g of fat<br />280 cal per can<br />Not a 16 oz can, rather a 14.5 oz. can<br /><br />I give this soup a 5/5 for packaging, 0/5 for ingredients, and 2/5 for flavor.  I like mild soups, but the lack of quality ingredients at this price really makes me pause.  I do not recommend.

review/text: I only discovered couscous a few years ago and absolutely love it!  The 'garlic & olive oil' flavor is my absolute favorite and I fix it every time I roast a chicken.<br /><br />I also love how simple & fast it is to fix this:  bring the water & a tablespoon of butter to a boil, dump in the spice packet, stir, then dump in the couscous.  Remove from heat, wait 5 minutes, fluff with a fork and serve.  It's a very delicious side dish in place of potatoes or rice.  (For those who don't know, couscous is a teeny-tiny pasta that looks a bit like rice, but is a softer texture.)<br /><br />I'm thrilled to find this product available in bulk purchase.  That makes each box quite a bargain!

review/summary: I love the taste, and it is my "emergency" food
review/text: I love Near East Couscous. I always have a few boxes of couscous on hand for "emergencies" when I had no time to cook and I am in a hurry. Not only do I like the taste it is the easiest and fastest thing to prepare that I know.<br /><br />Couscous is a coarsely ground pasta made from semolina, a type of wheat. When cooked it is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty. Instant couscous already has been steamed and then dried again before it is packaged. To prepare it it only needs be soaked in boiling water until it swells, a process that takes only a few minutes. You don't even need the stove.<br /><br />To start, measure out your couscous.<br />Pour it into a heatproof bowl.<br />Add hot water - the general proportion is 2 parts couscous to 3 parts water. So for 1 cup of couscous you'll need 1 1/2 cups water.<br />Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit for 5 minutes.<br />Fluff with a fork before serving.<br /><br />Couscous doesn't have a lot of flavor on its own, but it works well as a base for vegetable or meat dishes. I have not found anything does NOT go with it.  I like it with chicken, fish, lamb, and beef. I especially like it with the dishes have sauce as couscous absorbs the sauce so well.  It also mixes well into salads and can be flavored with herbs like coriander, basil. It's a great base for all sorts of dishes.<br /><br />I recommend it. It is a must have in my pantry!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: It's Really Good!
review/text: It's interesting to read the negative comments. We are a specialty food webzine, and taste and review thousands of products a year. We're pretty picky: We reject more than we accept to write about. We liked Baconaise so much that it was a Top Pick Of The Week, and we buy it by the case to bring as a small gift whenever we need one.<br /><br />Understandably, Baconaise doesn't taste like fresh-cooked bacon: It's a kosher-certified seasoning, with smoky flavors that resemble bacon. When you add it to a sandwich or a burger, though, the bacon flavor is there. We enjoy mock BLTs with it, and make a "BLT" hors d'oeuvre with a toast point, Baconaise, arugula or watercress and half a cherry tomato.<br /><br />Give it a shot! I'm not sure if Amazon allows links in these reviews, but here's our write-up of Baconaise: [...]

review/summary: Tastes like dog food
review/text: I am not a picky eater.  I love mayonnaise and I love bacon.  Naturally I had to buy this when I saw it.  After tasting I am baffled at how the company that makes it could have messed it up so bad.  It literally tastes what I imagine a bacon flavored dog snack would taste like.  I forced myself to try it on a turkey sandwich and could barely stomach it.  I can only imagine that any positive reviews are fake.

review/summary: In what universe does this taste like bacon?
review/text: This stuff is terrible. I have no idea how they consider this to be bacon flavored. It's vaguely mayonnaise-flavored, and slightly fishy. No other flavors are discernible. The fact that it's KOSHER should have tipped me off, but no, I decided to hope for the best. I'm sorely disappointed. I bought the jar, and I'm going to FINISH the jar, but this is not bacon flavored at all, and highly inferior to run-of-the-mill mayonnaise. As far as I can tell from the label, the "bacon flavor" is nothing more than liquid smoke. Every inch of this is false advertising. And while I'm at it, the J&D bacon salt? Kinda barbecue-y, and not bad on fries/tots, but again, not even a hint of bacon to be found.<br /><br />Long story short? Use mayonnaise, J&D has no idea what bacon is.

This arrabiatta sauce has a spicy snap to it and it is richer with more complex flavor than other brands: something I would say about each of their sauces. I have been a fan for years & suggest you give this company & this sauce a try.

review/summary: Tasty and fun! Great for variety in your pasta routine (NOT gluten free)
review/text: My husband and I are big pasta eaters. (No low carb diets for us!) This spinach fettucine has long been one of our favorite variations on our routine pasta dinners, and we used to buy them for $3 or more per box at the natural foods stores before our local supermarket started carrying them. But even the supermarket's prices have never been as low as Amazon's.<br /><br />These noodles make an elegant and tasty foundation for all kinds of sauces, especially white sauces like alfredo. Or just do what we do: sprinkle hot sauce and freshly-grated Parmesan cheese over them and enjoy the simplicity of the flavors. They taste great AND look great, and they're priced right.<br /><br />Edited to add: I just noticed today that the product description says "wheat and gluten free" (well, actually at the time of this writing, there's a typo so it says "wheat and guten free") and I'm fairly sure that can't be the case. I have an empty package here to remind me to reorder, and the first ingredient is semolina.<br /><br />So if you're gluten intolerant, this is not a purchase for you.<br /><br />If not, though, the rest of my review stands - I love this pasta.

The bag is not too big or small so it was perfect to give them the bag to snack out of.  My husband and I snack on them too!  The apple flavor gives just a little sweetness that is not over powering.  I plan on packing these for snack at school all year!

Mom & Dad love these too. I love how these rice cakes are just the right size. The bigger rice cakes you can buy were too big, and so messy. These are small and prefect to handle. No more huge messes. It's like your eating chips, but so healthy, shhhh! ;) Thank you HappyFamily.

review/text: In the summer, it is easy to get off track with treats, sweets and other junk food for the kids.  From vacations to trips to the pool, I am amazed at how much sugar and junk is around. I've loved these Munchie Apple Rice Cakes.  It is a crunchy and slightly sweet snacks that my kids (and myself) love.  I keep a bag of these in my car.  It is a great go to snack for my 2 year old and 4 year old.  I like that is it lower in sugar than a lot of the packaged snack food.  It is a healthy choice and my kids love it.  As we get ready to start school, I am looking forward to knowing the my daughter will have more options for her snack at school and for her school lunches.

They are smaller than regular rice cakes (perfect for little hands) and lightly sweetened with organic apple juice. He will eat them right out of the bag, but sometimes I also serve them topped with sunflower seed butter for a change. Either way, he loves them and I like that they are gluten-free and organic. There are only 3 ingredients and no weird additives, colorings or preservatives. Overall, a snack winner!

In various rat studies, Acesulfame K produced lung tumors, mammary tumors, and rare types of tumors in other organs (such as the thymus gland), several forms of leukemia and chronic respiratory disease, even when less than maximum doses were given. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, it was petitioned on August 29, l988 for a stay of approval by the FDA because of "significant doubt" about its safety.<br /><br />They taste great, but frankily, I'm afraid to eat them.

review/summary: Great Product, But Too Many Arrive Dented
review/text: My wife and I use a lot of canned tomatoes, especially in the winter.  But living in the city without a car, those cans get damn heavy to carry home from the store.  So when I saw Amazon offering them at basically a dollar a can (including delivery) I thought it was worth a shot.  I knew they might come dented, and sure enough a good number did.  Of the 24 cans delivered we had to toss 9 of them.  I can live with small dents, but some of these were deep, and right at the seam.<br /><br />I'm giving this review three stars as the cans that arrived without dents (or just slight dents) were all of the same (high) quality as the grocery store.  But losing a third of the cans to denting makes this not worth it to me.

But, these work very well in Chilli and Spaghetti Sauce!  Also, you will find some of the skin of the tomatoes included in this product too, which some people like and other don't.
