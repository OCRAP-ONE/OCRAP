review/summary: I love these to get a BOLD color
review/text: I've taken to making cupcakes and cookies and making icing letters on them...  you know, an "H" on one cookie, "A" on another, and so forth, and arrange the cookies or cupcakes to spell out HAPPY BIRTHDAY or whatever the occasion might be.  I prefer bold, rich colors, like jewel tone colors, so these gel colors fit the bill to get the bold color without watering down my icing.  Only takes a few toothpicks of color to get what I'm looking for, so each 1/2 ounce color is going to go a long way.  A good buy, all around.  I will never go back to regular liquid food coloring!<br /><br />Also, I know others have stated this but I'll say it again, the black color is good but you have to start with a chocolate icing, not a white icing.<br /><br />**Update** I found another use for these Wilton colors by making colored sugar.  I've used it with granulated sugar and with sparkling sugar (bigger crystals) and it works great either way, but the sparkling sugar is more, well, "sparkly" which I like since I use the colored sugar to decorate cakes and cookies with.  Put the sugar into a Ziploc bag, take the tip of a butter knife to get some color on it, then wipe the color off the knife on the inside of the bag. (Does that make sense?)  Zip up the bag, then mash the sugar around with the color until evenly distributed.  The color will come off the side of the plastic bag just fine and blend in with the sugar.  Then spread the sugar out on a plate or a sheet of foil to dry for a few hours.  Voila!

review/summary: Color Me Happy
review/text: As an experienced baker for decades, I have used gel, paste, liquid, and powder artificial colorings.  For the best control, I prefer the gels and powders.  Whether doing royal, butter cream, color flow, fondant, or marzipan, the gel gives me an immediate, true color.  I have been a Wilton customer for 30 years and will not use another brand.<br /><br />Tips:  When opening each little jar, DO NOT fully remove the foil cover over the product.  Insert a wooden tooth pick to open a small hole.  Unless you are making a large quantity of icing, you won't need to widen it and remove more than what is on your toothpick each time you pull out some color on it.<br /><br />Store the jars with the lids secured and in an upright position.<br /><br />I found another use for these colors recently.  I used wood putty to repair a decorative shelf made of fiberglass.  Using two shades of Wilton colors, I was able to re-produce the colors I needed.  Anything that needs color and is sealed with a protective coating and does not get much wear will probably be just fine.

review/summary: So Much Better Than Food Coloring
review/text: This is so much better than food coloring.  It only takes a very small amount to ad color to icing, cake batter, and cookie dough.  Some colors (especially red and black)when you are trying to get the deep rich color may leave a little after taste.  Try adding some alcohol based extracts (alcohol based extracts will not thin your icing like some artificial products will).  When trying to get the true black color, try starting with chocolate icing then ad the black color.  It requires less coloring thus less after taste.  These are the only 2 colors that I had a problem with after taste.  This product is great and I will continue to reorder this product.

review/summary: Amazing color!
review/text: Check the picture I've submitted to see the kind of color that just a little of the dye give you. There's a good mix of color choice here, everything from black to light flesh tone to violet. I've only made one cake with it so far but I only needed a little for spectacular results. I'll get a lot of use out of the amount provided, and when I'm done I will be coming back to this brand for more. There is a huge difference between this and normal liquid food dye that most of us grew up with!<br /><br />--Updated April 2011--<br /><br />The same jars have been in use for ages now and still continue to impress me. Just last week I used them to color some home made play dough with fantastic results-- I expected that there would be an issue with the dye coming off on little hands during playtime, but we were careful to mix the dye in with the dough and haven't had any issues. I highly recommend this set whenever someone I know is looking to do something involving food dye.

review/summary: Wilton Icing Color
review/text: This food coloring works great. It's the paste kind,  which really does color better, more vibrantly and wastes less than any other kind. Also, it comes with an extensive color palette, which inspires you to do better cake decorating (I think.)  Strangely enough, it even  comes with brown and black.  Also, this works for more than just icing. I'm an arts and crafts director at a summer camp, and we use this stuff to tine salt dough,  dye paper... you name it.

review/summary: Love making different colors
review/text: I have played around with this and made alot of different colors and shades. Although the only color I had problems with was black, I could not reach the true black color I got purple. Other than that I think all the colors are easy to use and you dont need alot to reach the shade your looking for. If some gets on your counter, it might stain but I used windex with ammonia in it and it came right up. The black did stain my plastic bowl purple but other than that this is a great product.

review/text: Received the Set of 12 color icings which were well priced.  I have used one color in a butter cream frosting. It mixed well and created a lovely yellow frosting.  Mixing different colors can produce a palete of new tints for decorating. The 1/2 ounce containers should last a long time as little color is needed.

review/summary: Beautifully Tints!
review/text: I recently bought these Wilton tints and they worked great!  I was able to tint white cake batter as well as buttercream frosting in seconds.  I do have to say, however, that the colors come out much better when used in the icing than in the batter.  However, overall, I was very pleased with how good the product was.  I agree with other reviewers about the red tint.  The red never seems to get really "red", but rather a really bright pink-red shade.  I used at least 8 of the colors in the past week, and have been really happy with all of them!  Highly recommend!  It is a great price for the variety that you get.  You only have to use a small amount of tint, so the set should last you a very long time.  This is a must have for any aspiring baker...and they work WAY better than food coloring!  Have fun!!

review/summary: Color output not even close to photographs
review/text: I bought these colors hoping to make a beautiful rainbow cake as pictured in the customer photographs.  Unfortunately I ended up with a pastel rainbow cake.  I tried several different recipes and different concentrations of color in my batter and didn't get a single vivid color.  I'm not sure if I got a dud batch or if they're all like this, but it was very disappointing. I did not notice any difference in the flavor of the cake due to the coloring, which was the one positive quality of this set.  Guess I'll save them for springtime baking...

review/summary: Great for icing, not always great for soap
review/text: I bought this based on several recommendations I had read on melt and pour soap sites. I'll say this for it, when it comes to coloring my soaps I've not been able to figure out WHAT color I will end up getting. I've had soaps start purple and end up dark green. I know this is a function of the interaction with the various fragrance oils and essential oils I use, something I wasn't really expecting to happen so frequently, particularly with purples, pinks, and blues. Some of the colors do stay true-- turquoise, green, yellows and orange. All this said, the item does say FOOD coloring, not SOAP coloring.<br /><br />I've also used this in both cream cheese frosting and regular decorative frosting and the colors are amazingly vibrant with only a small amount of colorant. I cannot taste any discernible difference in the frosting with the colorant. It will stain just about everything it touches-- my ceramic (formerly) white sink, hands, fingernails, and dish towels, to name a few. I wouldn't turn children loose with it without childproofing your kitchen first.

review/summary: FYI, these are gels, not powders.
review/text: I know this may seem silly, but I thought I was buying powder/dry icing colors.  These are gels, and as such, contain all kinds of junk in addition to the coloring, including high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, glycerine, and sugar.  Gels are preferable to liquid color because they don't dilute your icing or cause it to crack as badly, but powder/dry colors don't contain other ingredients so they don't spoil and aren't as bad for you!

That way the color can become truer- red dyed products will start off pink then go red, black products will go purple/gray to black

review/summary: Dirt Compared to the Old Recipe
review/text: I started using Wilton's dyes when I was thirteen, and a set lasted me until I was twenty-nine because they were so powerful.  Then I had to buy these awful new gels to replace them.  I can't get a brown darker than my skintone--and I'm Irish, okay?  I get sunburned indoors.  I had to put three quarters of a teaspoon in just to get a purple.  And it WILL water down your frosting.<br /><br />I'm utterly perplexed by all these positive reviews.  Did I get the dud package?  Does anybody know if I can get the old, thick paste dyes anywhere?

It has every color a person could need, including dark and light skin tones. And you can blend them to make even more shades if you desire.<br /><br />Each color comes in a smaller size than when you buy them individually, which is great for me because I only use them 4-5 times a year.

review/summary: Damaged packaging
review/text: Was disappointed that when I received the package as the box was obviously damaged, quite squashed. When I opened it the red food gel had leaked through the box. It hadn't all leaked out thankfully, but had made quite a mess. But as for the actual product, I am quite happy with it and think it was great value for money opposed to buying it in Australia where I would have had to pay almost the same P & H to get it sent 500 km's as I did to get it sent from the US, let alone the actual product price.

review/summary: Dogs love it, but be sure to give in moderation or you'll be sorry!
review/text: I bought this with the Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug, since it was recommended that they go together.  I have two papillons - one loved the toy and was quite good at getting the treats out of the bottle rather quickly...while the other one waited and consumed what fell out.<br /><br />That being said, they consumed a fair amount of the treats.  Not a lot, but a good handful.  Since the product was recommended to go with the toy, I had assumed that it would be okay for them to have more than just one or two of these. The next day, when it was Potty Time, I noticed that their #2's were bright green, and a little "loose" (sorry for being so graphic).  My dogs don't eat table scraps or any people food - I feed them Science Diet puppy bites, with occasional training treats, and this is the first time I've ever noticed a problem with their BMs.<br /><br />They seem to like the taste of these, though they prefer others.  I would recommend mixing them with some other treats rather than using them consistently, or you'll be cleaning it up later.  I will probably continue mixing these in with other treats/kibble until I use up the bag, but will not purchase anymore in the future.

review/summary: Yuck! Annie Chun should pay my medical bill!
review/text: I am growing more and more interested in Asian food. I am almost a regular at some nearby Chinese and Japanese restaurants (unlimited snow crab legs during the weekends, yum!), and I also enjoy Nongshim noodles, especially when I am getting creative and add extras.<br />That's why I ordered this set of teriyaki chow mein. It was the first time I tried Annie Chun brand.<br />Well, what's to be said? First, the noodles looked just OK, kind of like spaghettis. Of course I can get better Mexican fideos for less, but nevermind, I thought it is worth a try. The sauce was weird looking, but the bad part was when I tasted the combination. Ugh! It tastes awful, and I believe it caused me a stomach ache that lasted until next day. I almost went to the doctor.<br /><br />I am not saying it is bad for you, but for me, with an European stomach, so much abused by the American processed food, this "Asian" processed food was too much. I guess you could be fine with an Asian stomach. Can someone borrow me one for the rest of the pack or should I toss it?

review/summary: Dogs LOVE Filling,...Only
review/text: My three dogs go crazy over any Dingo product. However, they are expensive compared to other dog treats and after our dogs have chewed out the meat filling, they leave the rawhide cover on the floor and beg for another Dingo even though they haven't finished the first one. Pig Ears seem to be a better value for the money because the dogs eat the entire treat and end up spending more time exercising their teeth. I'll save the Dingos for very special occasions.

In fact, she won't finish eating any other brand of rawhide treats we've bought her.  I guess it's that Dingo "meat in the middle" that does the trick.<br /><br />However, as of writing this review Amazon is selling them for eleven bucks when you can purchase the same 21 count bag for seven bucks at petguys dot com.  They charge shipping, but if you stock up and buy 8 bags as an example, the shipping is only nine bucks.  Also, online coupons are frequently available for their website.

review/summary: Too much RED DYE!!
review/text: I didn't wanted to buy anything that was made with rawhide but a friend gave my pup a Dingo and he loved it. So I forced myself and brought my first bag of Dingo Dental Bones a month ago. Stitch loved it! I loved it too because he actually spent a good 45 minutes~2 hours on a Dingo Dental Bone. I didn't really like the red dye in the chicken meat but it wasn't overwhelming. If you actually crack a piece of the chicken off you can still see some non-dyed chicken.<br /><br />So I ordered a second bag of Dingo, just the original red package. The red dye was so strong that the whole piece of chicken was blood red and it even DYED the rawhide pinkish red!! It's kind of ridiculous to dye something the dog can smell! It's not necessary as long it tastes delicious.<br /><br />Anyhow I am on the search for something else, hopefully a better alternative other than Dingos.<br /><br />At least it wasn't made in China.

review/summary: Cheap Chinese-made products are dangerous to pets
review/text: I've stopped buying Dingo products when I noticed that they were being made in China.  I was on their website, and they answered one of the posters that was concerned about it, essentially stating that they test the products rigorously and go through strict quality control.  That's a bunch of CRAP !! They started making them in China to SAVE MONEY, they are not about to SPEND those savings on testing and quality control. What they do is GAMBLE that the products will be okay, and if they aren't they just RECALL them, write off the loss, and it's just too bad for the poor little pets that end up with life threatening illnesses.  Our government doesn't do anything about it, because our government is OWNED by Corporations, far be it for them to interfere with the Almighty Multi-National Corporations.<br />  I'm not taking ANY chances with MY dogs, I care for them way too much, to buy something that was processed in some factory in China that processes everything under the sun, from car batteries, to baby food. If there's some cross-contamination going on, it probably won't be discovered until it's already too late for SOME pets.

review/summary: My puppy tires of these...and they can be VERY dangerous!
review/text: My puppy loves to chew, so I got these.  She likes them until the meat entwined in them is gone, then she goes to something else.  Plus they can be VERY dangerous.  I saw her chewing on something one day and went to look.  She had found one of these she'd left where I didn't see it and had chewed it to where the end was gooey and mushy.  I've read that if they swallow this part, it can get caught in their intestines and block them OR in their throat and choke them.  I threw them away after reading that and reading sad stories of others who had to take their dog to the vet, expensive surgeries and such.  I'll never buy them or anything like them again.  I don't get anything for her that is rawhide, can splinter, etc.  The best thing I've found for her to chew on that is edible and safe is called "Beefeaters Sweet Potato Snacks For Dogs".  Do a search here on amazon.com or on Google and you can find them from $8.99 and up, but they're worth it to have something safe for your dog to chew on.  They are all natural, satisfies her need to chew, is full of vitamins and most importantly, SAFE for her.  They come in a huge bag, so for my little 6 pounder, they last a long time.  Sometimes I even cut one in half and give it to her.  The slices are pretty big, so they'd be very good for big dogs too.  Stay clear of ANYTHING rawhide or like that if you love your four-legged baby.

review/text: My 5 month old french bulldog puppy almost died on the first bone tonight.  He chewed it down and attempted to swallow a piece that was too big to go down his throat.  When he began gagging and throwing up I had to stick my hand down his throat to push the lodged bone into his stomach.  VERY scary and upset me greatly.  I do NOT recommend these bones.  There is even a choking warning on the back in small writing.  Keep your pet safe and purchase MUCH BIGGER bones for them, and take away anything too small so they cannot choke or get hurt.

review/text: When I got my dachshund from the Humane Society, she was overweight and had bad tartar on her teeth.  The vet said she'd need to be seen in a few weeks to have the tartar removed.  Instead, she was given a Dingo Bone every evening, which she chewed up.  Her teeth are nice and clean now.<br /><br />Missy was also placed on a low calorie food and no longer receives "people food". She gets her daily Dingo Bone right after her evening meal and she wants it IMMEDIATELY!  Doxies can get quite bouncy when they really want something.<br /><br />I really appreciate the large value package which is not offered in any store, and the price, plus the ease and fast shipping when I purchase through Amazon.

review/summary: A great treat for dogs
review/text: I discovered Dingo's about 5 months ago.  My 2 dogs love them.  I give them greenies which they devoured in less than a minute.  The minis take longer to chew and are a perfect treat.  I give them several times a week.

review/summary: My dogs go crazy for these.
review/text: We have a lot of foster dogs that come in and out of our house, and I've yet to meet a dog that doesn't love Dingos. I don't know what it is about these things, but they bring out the crazy in my dogs. We have to give them to the dogs while crated or they will fight over them, even dogs that don't have resource guarding issues. They must be delicious?

review/text: My two yorkies LOVES this product! I've had no issues with this product except that from time to time it gets stuck inbetween their teeth or they try to swallow it whole when it's almost gone, but that can happen with any raw hide. I'm only giving it a 4 star because it does not prevent tartar build up for my dogs.

review/summary: Good value mini rawhide bones - 40 lb Labrador pup enjoys them
review/text: After finishing a whole pack of 21 bones, our Labrador pup loved these bones with meat in the middle. A tasty treat indeed. The bones are wrapped properly and it keeps  both our puppy and us satisfied.<br /><br />In response to some glaring negative reviews, just be aware that anything your dog eats is a hazard. If those aforementioned bad experiences were true, I'm truly sorry. Take care of your dogs the best you can. Regardless, the rawhide is still a potential risk. However, the reviews referring to the bad quality due to the Chinese production is completely fraudulent. Just because it's made in China does NOT mean the product is made poorly.  It is simply a unsupported attack towards this company. I've also seen the almost exact "Anti-Chinese" review for Pork chomps rawhide bones.<br /><br />Some other thoughts:<br />* The meat in the middle can be a little jagged sharp sometimes. Just check it before feeding your dog.<br />* Great value for the 21 pack<br />* Our Labrador pup loves them<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with these rawhide bones with meat in the middle. If our puppy could say it, she would agree with me too.

review/summary: Our dogs love these
review/text: We have 2 dogs, one is 8lbs and the other 12lbs and both of them love these.  One bone keeps them busy for about 30mins.  They are fairly small so if your dog is any larger than 15lbs you will probably want to get the next size up.  Even our 12lb dog could handle something bigger but we buy one size out of convenience.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend these but I suggest that you watch the price, as it seems to fluctuate a lot.  I bought two bags for the price that one is currently listed for!

review/summary: Keeps the Pup Busy
review/text: If you have a dog or puppy that chews on everything and/or has a ton of frenetic energy, Dingo bones are great.  Some dogs need 'a job' to do to keep them out of trouble.  Each bone lasts my small terrier mix around 2 hours.  I enjoy, that unlike many dog treats, there is no odor or mess associated with Dingo Bones.  I wish that these were available for Subscribe and Save so I could get an automatic monthly delivery!

review/summary: Loved by one picky-picky dog!
review/text: My dog is super picky about her treats (probably because she is hopelessly spoiled).  Why have a dog crunchie when you can have "people food"?  So finding a good chewy treat that helps her teeth and keeps her happy has been somewhat challenging.  She ADORES Dingo mini bones! They are the perfect size for her (she's a 9lb Chinese Crested) and she will spend an hour just chomping away at these bones.  So happy to have found something she likes!

review/text: If you have a small dog as I have two then this is the deal for you. Yes my dogs chew the meat out first.  But they finish the rawhide too.  They also play fetch with these bones.  They are expensive but if you put them side by side to the Dollar Store ones there's more meat in them. They also sell some with double meat these are a wonderful product and they are worth the money.

review/text: My Jack Russells love these little bones.  They will chew on them until their gone rather than hide them or bury them for later.  I do have trouble with one dog eating them much faster than the other so then they get in a game of steal the bone, but hey, that just wears them out faster.  When I bought this, it was $12.99 which wasn't much of a "value" compared to the price at Kroger.  But I think they are now $9.99 which is like getting one 7-pack for free.

review/summary: DANGEROUS BONES!!!!
review/text: DANGEROUS BONES!!! Little dogs love these bones because they are tasty BUT they are truly dangerous. Our family Maltese (Pebbles) who had just turned one choked to death on one. They are not even safe if your supervising your dog because our dog choked on one in the presence of my sister. We were unable to do anything for her as we watched in horror as she slowly stopped breathing and got her to the vet in less than ten minutes. The vet attempted an emergency procedure and removed two peices and the bone had also tore her trachea. Her death was caused by these bones. These bones are not worth your precious pets life as it tore our family apart.
