review/summary: Superb honey...GREAT FOR HAY FEVER!!!
review/text: Since everyone else has raved about the taste and purity of this honey there's no need for me to add to the chorus. But I don't think anyone has mentioned that this little gem is an ABSOLUTE CURE FOR HAYFEVER. I usually have sneeze ATTACKS beginning in March and lasting all through the summer, esp. when it's time to mow the lawn. I've been taking this honey for the past month and I have sneezed twice, ONLY because I wasn't close to the honey. I take a teaspoon in the morning and another one in the evening and I don't experience a single symptom of pollen allergy. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you have hayfever. It's a lot cheaper and better than sudafed or any other OTC or prescription drug.

review/text: I love honey and this is the very best. smooth and creamy, never pasteurized and need i say delicious. I got 1 of these from vitamin cottage and got tired of slapping our kids hands in attempt to save a little for myself; so I decided to buy 4 of them from Amazon because I already knew that it was that good. HIGHLY recommended

review/text: The best honey money can buy. I first experienced this in a local Whole Foods store. It came in a smaller glass jar. I didn't realize the larger jars sold on this page were plastic. A disappointment. Yet, this is the finest, most delicious honey you will find anywhere on the planet. If you can't resist sweets, stay away from this. I eat a teaspoon of it a few times a week.

review/text: Several years ago I had bought a similar honey at a farm market, and loved how spreadable it was. When I went back to get more they no longer carried it, and I've been searching ever since.<br /><br />This has a beautiful floral honey taste to it, and it is perfect for spreading on toast. I know the two jars is going to last me a long time, so I hope Amazon is still carrying this when I'm ready to get some more for my cupboard.

review/text: This is great honey.  If you're a fan of the Bernard Michaud 1000 Flower honey, that's what this reminded me of on first taste.  I'll surely use this to replace it since it's half the price (please don't double the price like the other honey did!).  It goes very well with tea too.  It's very thick so it takes longer to stir; but you also would use less since I believe it has a lower water content.

review/summary: Sweet but no aroma whatsoever
review/text: The spreadability is less valuable to me than aroma, and with this honey you can only taste plain and rather dull sweetness, does not indulge your palate at all. Maybe, this is because the only sources for this honey are red and white clover blossoms. Also, being more thick than other honeys, it makes it hard to control intake: one tends to consume more, because it spreads as thick layer. Not a perfect dietary situation...

review/text: A little pricey for honey, but it's an occasional indulgence.  I originally heard about this on the Dennis Prager radio show.  I don't consider myself a honey fanatic, so I could not understand why the radio guys were waxing poetic about the honey, comparing it to devon cream and reviewing it like wine.  After I tasted it, I understood a bit better.

review/text: Hands down, I prefer white honey with tea over traditional honey sold in grocery stores.  Prior to this purchase, I was buying white honey from Teavana, but this was inconvenient as they are usually out, and it's quite expensive.  I found this product on an Amazon.com search for an alternative and decided to give it a shot.  For the price, it is great a quality white honey.  I don't even think I can taste a difference between this and the expensive Teavana-sold White Gold Honey.  Will definitely continue with this product.

review/summary: White honey has a downside
review/text: This honey is easily fermented during shipping if you order it on a hot month. When I opened the first jar, I could tell it was affected by the heat due to the excess white, gooey foam at the top. It also smelled slightly off and had a salty taste to it. I couldn't eat the honey past the first day of opening the jar.<br /><br />From what I could tell, it tasted a lot like powdered sugar and I'm sure the honey has a wonderful taste when it hasn't been ruined by the heat. It had a salty garlic aftertaste to it (definitely caused by the fermentation activating.) It was edible until the second day, when the yeast and fermentation process was taking over. Those first spoonfuls were good despite the aftertaste, and it would work well with a tea because of how sweet it is. You'll need less to sweeten, and that means the jar will last longer. It is unfortunate that it was too hot when I ordered this honey.<br /><br />The same thing happened when I ordered a jar of rata honey. Heat makes it begin a fermentation process and bam -- it tastes like spoiled milk, or in this case, garlic. This hasn't happened to me with any other type of honey (i.e: a naturally yellow or dark honey.) These 'white' honeys are just way more susceptible to fermentation. It could also be the plastic jar, and the seal, because the rata honey also had a plastic jar and seal. By the way, the rata honey came from Wedderspoon and they never replied to my e-mails, which indicates incredibly poor customer service (so, I don't recommend buying directly from Wedderspoon like I did.)<br /><br />Order this honey when you know it won't get too hot during shipping.<br /><br />The jar is BPA free and has a seal between the honey and lid.

review/summary: Foamy and Grainy
review/text: I was disappointed in the quality of this white honey. At the top of the bottle was a thick layer of gooey foam, the consistency of melted marshmallow, which I had to spoon off and discard. Beneath that layer was the honey and I found it grainy and not as firm as expected. Although not the highest quality for spreads, etc., it will do fine as a sweetener in tea.

review/summary: Texture Changed With Shipping
review/text: I really wanted to like this honey...  It has an amazing flavor, tooth-achingly sweet and creamy without any strong floral or fruity tones.  It would be perfect for cooking with or adding to tea when you want the goodness of honey without any distinctive flavors interfering.<br /><br />But it separated and arrived with a granular texture instead of a creamy one.  The replacement was the same way, but not as bad after being shipped with one-day shipping instead of two-day, which leads me to believe the problem might be shipping it in the summer heat.<br /><br />If you're going to buy this honey, I recommend ordering it in the winter so that shipping conditions are better.

review/text: I love this honey.  I first bought it at Williams-Sonoma but it is nearly twice the price there so I would not have bought it again had I not found it here.  This honey is thicker than the golden honey we usually see so it spreads on warm toast without becoming a drippy, sticky mess.  The flavor is more intense than orange blossom, too.  I really can't describe the difference in meaningful words so you will just have to try it.

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: I'm always looking for a new flavor to add into my flavored water lineup- especially since my favorite brand (Crystal Light) isn't exactly the cheapest thing in the world. Out of sheer curiosity (and since it was cheaper) I picked this brand up. Like the title says- YUM!<br /><br />The only bad part of these beverages is the most common problem that almost every powdered drink mix faces- that you can tell that these are powdered drinks. Once you can get past that, there really are more pros than cons to this mix.<br /><br />The positives are that there are a lot of vitamins in each flavor, with each one having their own special vitamin. My favorite has to be the dragonfruit/acai beverage, which also has the most vitamins of all the flavors. The other two aren't bad either.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty decent product & one I'll try to look for again in the grocery story since of this review (3/2010) it isn't offered on amazon

review/summary: Could Be Better
review/text: I bought these because I need sugar free drinks made without aspertame.  These are made with Splenda/sucralose.  I had great hopes for some more exotic flavors.  I love Passion Fruit anything, but the Passion Fruit Citrus has a bitter aftertaste, and I think this comes from the added caffeine and/or vitamins.  I didn't buy these for the vitamins or caffeine--but for the flavors.  The dragonfruit acai is not as bitter, but I still think the flavor would be better without added vitamins.  The strawberry kiwi is probably the best tasting.<br /><br />To be fair, these are "Vitamin Sticks"... similar to Crystal Light "Energy" and that one with added caffeine has the same bitter taste.  To be honest, I would rather just have coffee or take a caffeine pill, and have something more tasty to drink.  That is why I only gave it 3 stars.  I will probably drink the ones I bought, but don't plan to buy any more.<br /><br />They have an orange flavor that I gave 5 stars.  Their Ice Teas are very good too. I have ordered some other flavors and will give reviews when I get them.

Though pricy (as new foods often are), it packs enough nutrition into a small pot to displace common grains which do little more than take up space on the plate.

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: I've tried several of the other jerky flavors, thai peanut, barbecue, teriyaki etc. and have enjoyed most of them although I find some better than others.  This one is awful for the following reasons:<br /><br />1.  Flavor: it is barely "spicy", more sweet than hot.<br />2.  Texture: unlike the other jerkies this one is a lot thicker and comes out like a slab - the others tend to break up easily and are a lot more moist - it is nothing like "real" jerky which I still recall after 20+ years as a vegetarian.  There is nothing jerky-like about the texture - think of a piece of cardboard it's about that thick, dry, and very unappealing.<br />3.  Aftertaste: I get an awful aftertaste from this jerky - sort of a mushroomy/sweet taste that doesn't fade for quite awhile.<br /><br />I would highly recommend you try this by buying one - not 24 as I'm busy trying to find anyone to give these away to.<br />To sum it up in one word - yuck!

review/text: I love Gerber organic products like this which combine veggies and/or fruits. I bought one of the "Farmers Market" from the regular grocery store to make sure my 8 month old liked it, which he did. I bought a case from Amazon, but the consistency was like soup, very runny unlike the one I bought from the store. Heating it up made it worse. Maybe it was a fluke, but the second case from Amazon ordered a few months later had the same problem.

review/summary: Rich, sweet, full-bodied coffee from a k-cup
review/text: Despite giving Emeril's Big Easy Bold five stars, I think it only fair to open with a couple of negative points. First, if you're looking for authentic New Orleans style coffee, you'll likely be disappointed by the lack of chicory root. Frankly, I doubt that most coffee drinkers will mourn the lost chicory. Second, this coffee is a concentrated dark roast; if you're fan of light roasts and mild coffees, this variety will probably taste ashy and too strong.<br /><br />We just started using our Keurig B40 last week, and the first few k-cups I tried were disappointingly watery. The Emeril's Big Easy Bold is one of the few blends I've found that provides a full-bodied cup of coffee without any harsh overtones and without any nasty, bitter after-taste. Made with a single varietal (Colombian-grown arabica), Emeril's Big Easy Bold brews up with a rich cocoa aroma and a thin trace of crema. The flavor includes caramel, chocolate, and fruity notes with a hint of pepperiness, but the chocolate note lingers in the finish.<br /><br />I don't add sugar or cream to my coffee, but I doubt that either addition would detract from the overall experience. Excellent with scones.

It does not disappoint.  This is a very good cup of coffee, it has the strength I like, and the body one is used to from brewed coffee. It does have a pronounced Parisian roast flavor (my husband calls it 'cigarette ash' flavor) which is normal for New Orleans style coffee.  If you like that Parisian roast taste you will like this coffee.  It is not for the faint hearted!

review/text: My top 3 k-cups are Timothys midnight magic, Tully's French roast, and number one is Emerils. It is both bold and easy.....a perfect cup of coffee.The de=caf version is great too....just a little less bold.

review/summary: Great Bold Coffee!
review/text: This is a great Bold coffee.  I am an avid Starbuck's drinker.  I prefer the darker roasts.  This one fits the bill for me.<br />I also like: Timothy's Midnight Magic,Timothy's Rainforest Espresso, Coffee People Bold Black Tiger, and Gloria Jeans Black Gold.

review/summary: Bold BAM!
review/text: This coffee is for you if you are a BOLD coffee drinker.  Rich and robust with no bitter taste.  I drink my coffee black and the stronger the better.  This is the best single cup coffee I have been able to find and I have tried them all!  Gloria Jeans, The Coffee People, Newman's, Timothy's do not hold a candle to this one.  The aroma comes out of the kitchen when this is brewed making anyone who does not have a cup in hand want one too!  We brew so many cups of this blend that I had to decrease the time between shipments.  This coffee is good enough to keep me out of the local coffee shops.

review/summary: By far the best k-cup coffee I have ever tasted!!
review/text: I am constantly on the look out for good tasting coffee; but it has to be bold, strong and retain the taste, even after adding creamer.  I stopped using a sweetener a long time ago and I find that I enjoy my coffee more now.  This coffee, in my opinion, is the best I have tried so far in a k-cup variety.  It rivals even the coffee of my youth, made by my mom back in Puerto Rico.  My husband, who usually drinks pots (not cups :-)) enjoys it too!!

review/summary: The best yet
review/text: I am a coffee snob, let's face it. I am very picky, and I usually grind my own and use the adapter for my Keurig. I like my coffee bold but not bitter. This is the perfect Keurig style coffee for me. I've had my Keurig for a year now, and until this product came out, I was very disappointed with the bold types available. They are either too bitter or not bold at all. This is PERFECT. I brew it on the medium strength stetting. It's perfect for work and for when I don't want to mess with my barista. I buy it through the auto delivery subscription service.<br /><br />So now it's a clearance item? What - are they going to discontinue it??? NO!

review/summary: Not bitter? Says you . . .
review/text: I've had my Keurig for about two years and love the Bold coffees.  As any Keurig owner will tell you, with the Keurig, you have to buy Bold to get a decent strength or flavor to your coffee.  I usually buy the Newman's Own Bold (unfortunately no longer available on Amazon) or other similar flavors like Green Mountain's Nantucket Blend.  Unfortunately, Green Mountain isn't yet available on the Subscribe & Save program.  I was very excited to try Emeril's after reading the glowing reviews, in particular because there were several mentioning how smooth and non-bitter it is.  Many of the Bold K-Cup flavors tend to be bitter.  My excitement lasted until my first taste where I discovered a bold coffee with sour and bitter undertones.  It's not so bad that I won't finish it but I will not buy it again.

review/summary: The strongest bold yet.
review/text: This is the first K cup that I like using the largest setting. It would be nice if they had chicory root but it is mostly true to the flavor anyway. Clearly one to try if you like bold coffee. It has a little too much of the  burnt flavor to be my favorite but close.

review/text: I like strong coffee and have only bought "bold" flavors since getting my Keurig (the best invention since sliced bread). I must say that this is the strongest one I've found...really like the flavor and boldness. Again, I like strong coffee, but this is the first time that I've bought a k-cup flavor that stands up to a normally brewed cup of coffee -- bravo!

review/text: Just received my K-Cups.  Don't even have my brewer at home yet -- so had to bring them to work to try them.  This is a full bodied cup of coffee -- even at the 8 oz setting on the B3000.  It is not at all bitter -- and unlike STAR****s -- it does not taste burned.<br /><br />I managed to catch this at what must have been a sale price -- 2 boxes for 10 bucks.  Couldn't be happier.

review/summary: Dogs love 'em!
review/text: Not only do the dogs love these, but they last them a very long time. I had one teething pup that worked on a knuckle bone slice for a couple of days. The only drawback (preventing me from giving the full 5 star rating) is that they're a bit stinky. I do take them away from the dogs when they get to a small enough size that the dogs might try to swallow it - - they're quite hard and could certainly be a choke hazard.
