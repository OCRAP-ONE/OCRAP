review/summary: Fine Basic Tea
review/text: ****<br />This is a good, albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash. It is made from blended black teas. I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****

review/text: These chips are really good.  I expected them to be thick and heavy but they are just the opposite.  One of my kids likes to eat them instead of potato chips..plain out of the bag.  The other likes to eat them in place of tortilla chips...with salsa or guacamole.  With the natural ingredients and high fiber, these are a great replacement to all types of chips.

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.
review/text: Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.  I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these, but otherwise I think they are great.  I highly recommend that you try them.

review/summary: Works great for my Pit Bull
review/text: About a year ago, I rescued a Pit Bull that was about 4-5 years old (American Staffordshire, as far as I can tell, red nose).  She was in the shelter for about a year before I got her (no kill), and she was a stray prior to that.  I've put together pieces of her former life (it's not pretty... poor thing was used as a bait dog, from what I can gather, and I initially started her on softer foods because her teeth are filed down), but one thing I know for certain is that she was severely underweight when she came to the shelter, tipping the scales at a whopping 30lbs or so.  They did a great job taking care of her, and she was about 52lbs or so when I got her in April '11.  Unfortunately, in the shelter, they can't be too picky when it comes to dog food and, as I found out, my little runt has a very sensitive stomach.  As I came to learn, beef based foods gave her bad gas, lamb based foods made her shed like crazy, and through it all, she had loose stools.  I finally decided to try going grain free and see if that helped, and settled on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SBGH2M">Natural Balance Limited Ingredient Diets Grain Free Chicken & Sweet Potato Formula - 28lb</a>.  She loved the food right away, preferring it to her other food that I was weening her off of (Purina Proplan fish for sensitive stomachs, and it smelled AWFUL... I did side by side tests, and she always went for the LID stuff first).  Her stools are normal now, and though she still gets sick once in a while, it's much less frequent than it used to be.  She seems to be happy and healthy, and she's ringing in around 54lbs.  I also use the same brand treats for her, both in Chicken and Sweet Potato and Venison and Sweet Potato formulas.  I really think that grains were a big part of the problem; when we go out, and people end up giving her treats (she's a pro at sucking up to people), she'll get sick if she gets Milk Bones or similar (grains), so I have to watch her intake with those; like I said, she's a pro at conning people out of treats, and they'll give her every last one if I don't say something.<br /><br />I can't say it's been the food alone, as I've also treated her for giardia and give her probiotics, but I think it's a winning combination, and she's doing great.  She eats a little less in the winter since we're a little less physically active due to the cold, but she seems to be very happy with this line of food and treats.  I'm debating picking up a small bag of the Venison flavor and mixing it in just for some flavor variety, but I also don't want to upset her stomach, so the jury is still out on that.  Regardless, I can certainly recommend this food, and will say that it's been worth the higher price.  I'm sure my pup would agree!

review/summary: Literally Just What I Asked For
review/text: I should have named my Yellow Lab Thief because he seeks only to kill and destroy. (Gospel of John 10:10). He ate the outlets off the back of my house. He ate part of my car...You get the idea. The only toys  he can play with are the solid Nylabone (no rubber , no matter how hard). He even breaks through bones and figured out how to chew the top off a Kong to get the treat inside. But he loves hidden treats. So I begged Nylabone to make a hollow Nylabone and sure enough they did. My Lab absolutely LOVES it. He carries it around and the only thing that comes close is his Frisbee. Can't recommend this enough. There are plenty of teeth marks on the trunk but it's still great and keeps him busy trying to get treats out of the "log." I even tweeted Nylabone a photo. This is literally just what I asked for? You'll love how your furry friend will love it!

review/summary: Something for the super chewy dog
review/text: I have purchased many nylabones and have had success with dogs that love to chew toys.<br /><br />I got a new dog who doesn't like chew toys but does like food, a lot. And at the same time, if he does chew something he could easily destroy it.  I thought that if I put peanut butter or something like that in this hollow part of the dura chew he'd enjoy working at getting the food and not destroy the nylabone in the process. In addition it has 'branches' for him to help hold the chew bone in place.<br /><br />It didn't work out the way I expected.  It's too heavy for him to want to carry around and he can't get his tongue very far in the hole so he gets frustrated. I'd almost say it's a little too indestructable. Once he gets the food that is accessable to him out he puts it aside.<br /><br />It's a good toy for dogs that like nylabones. The hollowed out part didn't work like I thought it would.

review/text: I have several dogs in several sizes.  Nylabone products are always the ones that last.  When my pit bit off an arm of this toy I almost fell off the couch.  He bit off a Nylabone!  It wasn't until I found the toy outside a few days later and picked it up, realizing that it's not solid.  Makes me wonder what other toys are not solid from NB.  We still love the brand, but I would examine new toys carefully before buying them to see if I can tell if they are solid or not.

review/summary: Our dog totally adored this, but destroyed it in about 48 hours
review/text: We picked up one of these bones at a local pet store last week. Our dog picked it out herself; I held out two different shaped bones for her to sniff to see if she had a preference, and she actually grabbed this one's package out of my hand. She's never shown that much interest in something in the distracting environment of a store, so it came home with us. For two days, it was her constant companion, she absolutely LOVED this bone. She'd grab the whole thing around the middle and chew it on her back teeth with her head tilted back, so that she was chewing the red part more than the nubs. This might account for it's early demise... at the end of the second day I found it on her dog bed in three pieces, including one that was just the right size for an intestinal obstruction, and I quietly made it disappear while she wasn't watching. She's still looking for it two days later, sadly, and I thought about trying another one in the largest size available, but I don't think I want to risk it. We got the wolf-size the first time, and our dog is a 48 lb. Boykin Spaniel/Pit Bull mix. She is is a pretty serious chewer - she's the only dog I've ever had chew a Nylabone Galileo down to a nub that had to be thrown away and replaced - so this might not be a problem for most dogs.

review/text: I have a 70 lb lab/hound mix who loves to chew, so I always buy her the Nylabone Durachew toys. This is my first time buying this one for her and it arrived today. She's had it for about 4 hours and is already destroying it and I literally just saw her eating pieces of it as I'm typing this. It's going in the trash. Summary: My dog absolutely loves it and I don't. I should have ordered her another Galileo; it might shed little white flecks on the floor or injure my children when she flings it across the floor, but it's a lot more durable and safer for her to chew on than this one (and she loves it).

She is a powerful chewer, despite being only 21 lbs. and she has already done a bit of damage to the ends, but nothing that would require my taking it away.<br /><br />One thing I noticed, is that this toy is made in China while other Nylabone toys say, "Made in USA."  Well, either way, I will keep this one until she destroys it, but I think I will take it away from her when I'm not around.  I don't want her playing with this one unsupervised.<br /><br />Nylabone is great, my dog always has to have at least one or two around at all times!

Beagles on the small end up to 50-65 pounds.<br /><br />The giant size (souper) is for very large dogs over 65 pounds.

review/text: Our six year old 92 pound Old English Bulldog and his partner in crime our 6 month old puppy of the same breed - are the certified kings when it comes to destroying even the toughest toys. A long time fan of Nylabone products - because they design toys with the dog in mind and not humans, and have been producing some of the finest, most durable dog toys here in the United States for over 50 years.<br /><br />A rarity among dog toys that beg for our attention with an army of adorable kitty cats, bunnies and an endless parade of cute toys.<br />With the majority of them resembling road kill in a very short time.That said, we had a feeling this particular toy being  made of the so rock solid Dura Chew material and scented like Bacon - they would be a huge hit.And boy, were they ever. Our Bulldogs simply LOVE this toy!<br /><br />Our oldest  Bulldog "Harley" is finicky about toys and loses interest after a hours, but kept this chew bone in his mouth for hours - even walking around the house with it looking like he was puffing on a big fat ole' stogie.Elvis, our 6 month old Godzilla chewer couldn't leave it alone for one second - and managed to do some serious damage.<br /><br />This toy is just Great.<br /><br />1) Huge size makes it fun for any medium - giant size dog.<br /><br />2) Can be carried around (or dragged)  if your pooch is strong to lift it.<br /><br />3) Holds up very well, the material is surprisingly strong and resilient.<br /><br />4) Quality construction means no seams - no pulling the top cover off.<br /><br />5) Bacon flavor is very subtle and adds to cranking up the crazy. Making this toy even more fun for your dog.<br /><br />6) Wood texture is molded into toy<br /><br />7) Thick but Hollow so adding a treat to crank up the crazy is effortless to do.<br /><br />If you're looking for an excellent toy, that can stand up to big time chewers - you can't go wrong with huge stick from Nylabone.<br />Like any dog toy supervision is key and an effort should be made to enjoy this toy along with your pooch under a watchful eye.<br /><br />5 PAWS UP!

review/summary: Great toy for a lab!

review/summary: Currently my power chewer's very favorite Nylabone...
review/text: ...and the first we have found that is bacon flavored, instead of chicken or "original" flavored, whatever that is.  It has the added advantage of holes on the ends for people that like to stuff treats in the chew toys.  And even with shipping, we got it considerably cheaper at Amazon.com than in any local pet store, even PETsMART...

review/summary: Loves but didn't last
review/text: We have a golden doodle who is a strong chewer. His nylabones usually last but he chewed this one in half in about a week. He absolutely loves this toy though. It is his favorite even a month later when he only has a part of it left. If he wasn't such a strong chewer I would definitely get this toy again.

review/summary: Best Dog Bone
review/text: We have an American Bulldog, that loves to chew and play with her toys.  Usually toys last hours, never days. Her Nylabone has lasted months.  I'm buying her another, just so she can have a second one.  Of all her toys, it is her favorite.  The bacon flavor is a PLUS.  After a while it does look chewed up but it's long lasting, by far.  These and Tuffy's are our favorites.  I will not by anything else.

review/summary: My Dog Likes It
review/text: I have tried giving my dog, a heavy chewer that can demolish large reindeer antlers within a day, a variety of different Nylabone products.  The problem with many Nylabone products is that they are plastic or rubber and their flavor is not particularly attractive to the dog.  As a result, my dog is often quick to abandon them for the furniture, my sneakers or any of the other things that we buy them these products to prevent them from chewing.  I tried giving this Nylabone DuraChew Hollow Stick Dog Chew to my dog because 1) it is bacon flavored so I hoped my dog would like the taste and 2) it looked a little bit different from the other Nylabones.  So far my dog has spent more time working over this particular Nylabone than he has almost any other plastic or rubber chewing toy that I have given him.  I am not sure whether it is the flavor or texture that he likes.  But I am thrilled to give him something other than rawhide that he likes to chew on.  Like other Nylabone products, the DuraChew Hollow Dog Chew is extremely tough.  I believe it was designed specifically for heavy chewers.  While my dog has definitely made some dents in it, it is still in pretty good shape and I expect it to last two or three months.  Every dog is different and you never know exactly what they will like.  But if your dog is a heavy chewer and you want to try something a little different from most Nylabones you might want to give this a try.

review/text: Carmelina brands are imported directly from Italy and boy does the quality show. The beans are always firm, buttery inside and colorful without color and firmness retention additives. The Red Kidney beans are no exception to that rule. Yes, a few cans get dented but you are getting something from Italy and it is AUTHENTIC without a bunch of crap in it. Unless a can is bulging or leaking there is NO problem with the canned contents.<br /><br />Viva Italia!<br /><br />Dear Amazon.com,<br /><br />I love you guys! Please keep importing Carmelina brand products! They are top notch!

review/text: My daughter is now 2 and we have been buying Happy Baby product from Amazon since she was 6 months old. They almost always have the best price and best selection! These are the best portable snack for a active toddler! My daughter loves the taste and I love that it is a healthy snack. A added benefit I have found is that the extra fiber helps keep her digestive track in check. She has had constipation problems since around a year and these have been the key to keeping her comfortable. For the best price Join Amazon Mom and subscribe and save. Lifesaver for those of us who live in Very rural communities!

review/text: These are amazing pouches.  My son will usually eat 1-2 per day, which is at least 100% of the vitamin A and C that is required for his age.  It's not always easy to get him to eat vegetables and fruits, and this is a nice, convenient way to encourage healthy eating.  I HIGHLY recommend these!  This is the most nutritious version of the HappyTot pouch, as well.

review/summary: Good way to ensure daily fruit and veggie for the new solid food eater
review/text: I love these for my son (he is now 14 months).  He likes these because he can do it himself - he's very anti-other people feeding him at this point, so with these he gets to do it himself - they're fairly clean but every once in a while when he's in a particularly "playful" mood he realizes that he can squeeze it out and fingerpaint with them - still much cleaner and more efficient than trying to spoon feed him these days tho.<br /><br />I also use the subscribe function so these (along with two other varieties of these) get delivered every 3 weeks to my house - amazon gives a little bit off the cost as well and then i don't have to worry about it - its also MUCH cheaper buying in bulk this way via amazon as opposed to something like $1.50 each in the grocery stoe

review/summary: Great Product, Wrong Size from description
review/text: Love this product. Perfect for babies while on the go. We actually purchased these specifically while on vacation (usually I just have a few on hand for occassional use). My daughter gobbles these up. I just wish they sold a variety pack! I find myself filling with with individual ones of a different flavor here and there cause I can tell my daughter gets tired of it.<br /><br />Although, along with a previous review, I too, received the 3.5 ounce package rather than the size stated in the description. BUT, Amazon has amazing customer service and immediately fixed the problem. And that's the only reason I give it four stars (and the fact that I wish there was a variety).<br /><br />If you are thinking about buying these, totally worth it.

review/summary: Baby loved it, convenient pouch
review/text: Like others have said, the consistency of this stage 2 combo is very thin, but it could be thickened with oatmeal or cereal. My 7 mth old loved the flavor and impatiently waited for more, which she doesn't do with all baby foods. I like that it contains spinach for iron and fruit for antioxidants and to sweeten it a bit. I wouldn't use these everyday while I'm home because they are somewhat costly per pouch, but they are a terrific option for travel or when you need something easy on hand to feed baby. I tried squeezing the contents of the pouch into her mouth, which she didn't particularly like, but I think that's just because she's used to being fed with a spoon. An older baby could squeeze and eat this themselves and if you find yourself without a spoon, it's a great option.

I wish it was a little greener, indicating more green beans and peas, but he loves it and I'm thrilled with that.  His favorite meal I think is a pouch of Chick Chick and a pouch of this.  As long he continues to love it, I will make sure to keep it stocked for him.  Love it!  I also love the convenience of this style of pouch since you can just squeeze it straight onto the spoon and save what you don't use for later.

We've tried all of the different flavor combinations Happy Tot has to offer, and this is by far our favorite - incredible, really, when it's nearly impossible to get my son to even touch peas or green beans. Like most fruit / veggie pouches, these travel well and are convenient for on-the-go. The lid screws back on as well in case your tot doesn't finish his / her snack. The Subscribe & Save price is right for us as well - at barely over $1 per pouch, these are the cheapest snack pouches to be found!

We don't eat these everyday just a few times a week and Amazon has the best price!

review/text: I love the variety of flavors and fruit/veggie combinations HappyTot offers.  Being a foodie myself, I don't really expect my little one to want to eat the same flavors or items every day so knowing I can offer her a variety and great combos like the Banana, Mango and Peach pouch has been a great saving grace since she really likes to try different things almost weekly.  This flavor seems to be her favorite one though as she'll eat this one or ask me via 'sign' for this pouch more then the others.  With it being organic, all fruits and with great vitamins, I'm thrilled to have this readily available for her to enjoy.

It's nice to have these around so I at least know they are getting some organic fruits and veggies (with none of the yucky additives that so many other kids foods have!) I also find that the squash & apple flavor makes a nice addition to oatmeal, muffins, and pasta sauces (a great way to sneak in even more veggies!)

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: These pouches are a godsend. I keep a stockpile in the pantry and in the car. Even on days when my two-year-old is feeling particularly picky, he will eat these up without blinking an eye. I love that they are made with organic ingredients with TWO green vegetables -- peas and green beans -- in one pouch, not to mention the pear for fruit. I also like that the salba is included in these pouches for the omega 3s and extra fiber. I had never heard of salba before, but it is a very nutritious grain that I'm glad to have in my son's diet. These pouches are dairy-free, nut-free and gluten-free too, so I never had to worry about them affecting my son's food sensitivities, although he has now outgrown most of them. All in all a great product and the flavor is a winner, even with my picky son!

review/text: I have been ordering Happy Tot food for the past six months via Subscribe and Save.  My son devours all of the combinations.  They are so easy to use.  Recently my son stopped taking food from a spoon, but he will let me squirt the pouches into his mouth.  I've also used the fruit blends in my older sons' smoothies.

review/summary: so easy- both baby & toddler LOVE it!
review/text: I needed an alternative to making my own baby food when I found these pouches at Target. It was SUPER easy to warm up the food just by putting the pouch in warm water, then serve to my baby. First I gave it to him using a spoon, but then he was reaching for the pouch so I just gave it to him! He absolutely loved it! I think the novelty of the pouch is so much fun for him. And I was happy that he was getting organic fruits and veggies for the day. Then my 3yo wanted to try it-also bc of the novelty- and she loved it too! I never thought she would eat "baby food" and spinach at that! But in the pouch, it's a great on the go snack or meal and it's healthy and we are all happy.

review/summary: Innovative, healthy and YUMMY!
review/text: We love these HappyTots! The flavors are wonderful and the added Salba grain is a great way to add nutrients. My son is in Kindergarten and he asks to take these to school for snack time. The pear added to this combo is especially nice since it adds sweetness not found in the veggies - a very nice balance of flavor. Also, the convenience of the pouch is so great, I keep some in my bag, in my car and at the grandparent's house so I know a healthy snack is always available. Highly recommend trying this product and flavor if you are looking to add tasty nutrition to your child's diet.

review/summary: The BEST
review/text: I have a four year old, three year old and 18 month old that love these. When I buy them, I have to get very creative with hiding them or they'll eat them all at once. I didn't know what they were and was very health concious with my slightly chubby and younger daughter. One day while on a walk, we saw these at Target so I bought them each one. Ever since we can't even drive past Target without being asked to stop and get them. We do a lot of traveling and I love these. My oldest is very picky, never ate baby food and was always a "junk foodie". This is the 1 healthy thing that goes down with out a fight. In fact she'll ask for more, then fight her little brother for whatever he still has left in the pouch. We do a lot of traveling and I always pack lots of these, quick, easy and healthy snack on hand.

review/text: My toddler loves this food so much that we have to keep it out of her sight to keep her from refusing whatever other food we're trying to feed her.  I can't for absolutely sure say it's this, but since these squeeze packs were introduced into her diet she will poop more than the usual...Just a friendly warning.<br /><br />These are amazingly handy to take with you when you go out since it gives them a dose of fruits and veggies all without needing a spoon.  My 1 year old has no problem holding the pack on her own and sucking the goo out of the pack.

review/summary: Good food, wrong product!!!
review/text: I ordered this for my 7 month old who LOVES this food. I ordered the 4.22 oz pack of 16, but received 3.5 oz pack of 14. I'm about to return it and ask for the correct product to be sent, but had I not looked closely, I would've just accepted this. Just be careful and make sure you're getting what you ordered. It says it comes from Amazon, but I'm wondering if there's a Happy Baby problem as well...the nutrition facts on the box don't match the nutrition facts on the pouch for the same 3.5oz serving. For example, the box says there's 100% daily value of Vitamin C while the pouch says 27%. I'm wondering if anyone else sees any discrepancies? I would think this would be illegal?

I never leave home without several pouches.  They have been super helpful when traveling and when out, in general.  My baby now sucks the food out, which makes it even more convenient than using a spoon.

review/summary: Great for Toddlers - this flavor is the most nutritious.
review/text: Our toddler loves this brand. We have tried the other brand of pouches, but she always goes back to these. The flavor and texture is the most favorable to her. We just recently subscribed to this item, because you could not beat the price. Target and our grocery stores have all increased their prices on this line, so they are no longer competitive with Amazon. There is also the bonus convenience factor since our stores were constantly running out of this brand.<br /><br />This flavor is the most nutritious. The pale green pouch comes second, but this combination really has by far the most nutrients than all the other flavors. Toddlers are of course picky and fickle, but our toddler very rarely turns down a "pouch" when all else fails.

review/text: I love these pouches!  From their ease of use for the baby (who just sucks it out of the pouch), to the easy-carry little-mess take-along value, to the interesting combinations of food.  The combos are perhaps odd, but good.  I love that some have the grains too, as that is what is needed to keep baby fuller longer.  I take at least one everywhere we go.  Needed one for the 6 yr old the other day who was hungry while we were out.  She loved it too.

I would eat any of them if I was so inclined to eat a pureed meal. They are easy to pack & throw in the diaper back/suit case for travel. I had no worry about them leaking (like a small plastic tupperware). The price is right, shipping was quick, and they store really well in the pantry in the ready made box. Happy Baby = Happy Mommy

review/text: My 16-month-old LOVES these squeezey packs!  They are best for long car trips when you don't want to stop and pull out a meal's worth of food.  My little one will happily suck on it while we drive.  :)

review/summary: Great on the Go
review/text: I got these for our my 9 month old to use while we are out and about. They are great at the beach, park and for traveling because I dont need a spoon or have to juggle with a jar. And clean up is very easy. Plus I love that he is getting really great organic nutrition and his omega 3's.
