review/summary: Super tasty and not as smelly!
review/text: Okay, so these ones contain by-products and sodium nitrite, but they're not terribly high on the ingredient list, so lets just take off one star and ignore it for the rest of the review.<br /><br />My cats believe this is the tastiest flavor of fancy feast.  Considering they love fancy feast in all of it's delicious classic style flavors, making a choice had to be hard.<br /><br />As a plus the "& liver" classic flavors seem to smell a lot less potent than their "feast" counterparts.  They also seem to make for less stinky feces.  I'm not sure why, but my whole household agrees.  I still like to alternate between the foods regardless of preference, though, so we continue to buy all of the available classic flavors.<br /><br />My favorite things about Fancy Feast are the low price point and the fact that I can feed my cats a low carb meal that is enjoyable to them.

review/summary: Cee Cee loves this
review/text: This humble little lady cat who spent her early years roaming the mean streets no longer has to scavenge for her food. She loves her Fancy Feast Liver and Chicken and eagerly devours it. She likes some other flavors of Fancy Feast canned too, so I alternate once in a while (carefully, becuz cats need to take a while to get used to the other flavors of their cat foodies)<br /><br />My only concerns are with the food coloring (that's for the humans, so they don't get grossed out by unexpected colors? Certainly the cats don't care) and the artificial flavor. But that does not stop me from giving it to Cee Cee -- after all, she turns her nose up at all the other brands of cat food I get for her.

review/summary: Loved in this house!
review/text: When my cat gets tired of the gourmt Fancy Feast Chicken, I put this one in the mix and she loves it!  As a rule, for some reason, I've never had a cat that would eat liver.  Don't know why, just don't like it I guess.  But this one was different for some reason.  When you open it, it doesn't smell overwhelmingly of liver, mostly chicken, which is probably why she likes it.  Great stuff, healthy and full of protein. Price is a little high though, don't understand that.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: GREAT Alternative to Raw
review/text: I have 5 toy dogs.  My almost 2 year old Japanese Chin, Yoshi, has a severe underbite and has difficulty eating dry dog food.  The other 4 eat Origen dry.<br /><br />I want my dogs to live healthy long lives.  I tried raw but it isn't practical for me to use.  Only some of the dogs eat raw anyhow and Yoshi, who is the one I am having trouble feeding, couldn't eat it even if she did like it (which she doesn't).<br /><br />I use a variety of dehydrated and freeze dried food for Yoshi.  I am one of those people who think dogs should have some variety in their food.  Four of the dogs will eat ANYTHING but when they start getting picky, I switch to another flavor.<br /><br />After much research, I decided to try Stella &Chewy's freeze dried food.  Don't let the 6 ounces fool you since they are freeze dried and don't weigh much.  Just add some warm water and you have your raw Duck dinner!!  She LOVES this food and almost always eats every bite.  I alternate with Grandma Lucy's and Addiction all of which are easy for her to eat.  It is a great product and if you aren't feeding big dogs or lots of small ones, it is not too expensive.  If all my dogs were on it, I probably couldn't afford it except as a special treat.  But for a small dog, it is very affordable and I heartly recommend Stella & Chewy's as a raw alternative.

review/summary: My pup loves these!
review/text: If this is being fed as a meal, it could get expensive - fast.  Since I have an 80 lb Doberman, feeding this as a meal really isn't an option so I use this as a special treat for her or the occasional meal sprinkle.  The patties themselves feel rather delicate and flaky (of course, since they're freeze-dried) but I can easily break them into smaller pieces without them falling apart in my hand which is certainly appreciated.  I'm pleased with the quantity in these bags and for the price, it's comparable to other dog treats I have bought for my dog.  It might be a little more expensive but if given the choice, I would rather buy these because I can give them guilt-free seeing as they don't have all the garbage a lot of other dog treats have.  Anyhow, my dog LOVES these and the second I took the bag out of the amazon box she was sniffing and sniffing it and then promptly sat down and stared expectantly which is her way of saying 'yeah, I want those!'.  Actually, one of my cats really loves these too and she's picky when it comes to her own cat treats (she'll only eat greenies consistently...and these).  I let my cat sniff since she was curious and I expected her to turn her nose up to it like she does with a lot of other treats...well, I was wrong.  She grabbed it, turned around and just devoured it.  My other cat will only sniff though, no interest in it whatsoever so I think it's really a case-by-case basis but don't be surprised if your cat's going to want to share with your pup!  If you're looking at reviews, obviously you're considering buying this product and I'd say go for it.  Even if you can't afford to use this as a meal (which even for the smallest dog I believe is at least a few patties a day), get this for your dog as a special treat!  Not messy, healthy and apparently incredibly tasty! :)

review/summary: Great everyday tea
review/text: I have been drinking Good Earth Decaf Green Tea for many years and it is my favorite tea. This tea is not purely green tea leaves - it also contains lemongrass and other flavors. It is flavorful but mild. Ingredients: Decaffeinated Green Tea, Lemongrass, Natural Flavors (Contains Soy Lecithin), Rose Petals and Peppermint.<br /><br />Be aware that the Good Earth Decaf Green Tea does not have the more delicate flavor as real Japanese green tea (and not a roasted flavor like Genmai), but it is great as an everyday tea. If you are expecting green tea like in Japanese restaurants, this is not it - if you want that, get high quality loose tea leaves and brew it with the correct temperature water in a teapot. (Although maybe the Good Earth green tea would taste more similar to Japanese green tea if brewed like Japanese green tea should be - read on...)<br /><br />I often leave my tea bag steeping for a long time (I know, not recommended for green tea, but it likely does extract more of the beneficial antioxidants), up to 30 min, and this tea does not get bitter. It also does not get bitter if the tea sits around before drinking. One Good Earth tea bag works fine for my large 16 oz mug. I have found that other brands of tea can be weak and not flavorful if using only one bag for 16 oz water.<br /><br />I also like that this tea is decaf since even the smaller amount of caffeine in green tea affects me. Decaf green teas are somewhat hard to find. This company uses a CO2 process for decaffeination, preferable to a solvent extraction process.<br /><br />Note that this product is available in 18-count and 25-count boxes.<br /><br />I have tried many other brands of green tea (decaf and regular) over the years and keep coming back to Good Earth brand. Highly recommended.

review/summary: tea of the gods!!!
review/text: One sip of this tea, and I was hooked.  A sweet, mild, flavorful, green tea blend that needs no sweetener at all.  DELICIOUS.  I can't imagine why, but Good Earth changed the name of this tea from Green Tea Blend to Lemongrass.  It was very confusing for weeks I was sure they had taken it off the market.  Finally I found one web site smart enough to point out the switch.  I buy it by the case, because my son and I go through it so quickly. Each of us drink it both hot and cold every day.  I only use decaffeinated but even the regular does not contain much caffeine (compared to coffee)!

review/summary: Good tasting green tea
review/text: I am not a tea expert, but I am trying to get healthier and green tea is an area that I thought I should try. I tried several others and almost gave up because the taste was a little to bitter. Maybe it's the lemon grass but this tea is different, it even smells good in the wrapper.<br /><br />I do add local honey to each cup ( my only previous tea was sweet tea usually from the south ), and let it sit for 3 - 5 minutes to seep in hot water. Tastes pretty good. I did some research and this company rates favorably on their processing methods, which leaves in the healthly aspects of the tea.<br /><br />I usually drink it later in the day, hence the need for decaf. I drink very little caffine, and most teas would keep me up, but this doesn't.<br /><br />The price for 6 boxes of 18 bags each is pretty good compared to the grocery stores, they do seem to change the packaging periodically so you have to make sure your getting the right one. But overall a tasty green tea, I have read that green tea purists do not like the lemon grass, but i think it made the diffence on finding a green tea I like.

She brought out a package and showed me that it was a commercial container of European Dark frozen coffee from Douwe Egbert (which I had never heard of). So once i got home, I ordered a variety of the Douwe Egberts coffee and loved them all, but the Intense is the closest to the Bellagio joe.  Discerning coffee friends also loved it when they had some, and asked what it was.  You have to try this. Yes, it's ground, but it is vacuum sealed into a hard block, and seems to lose no aroma or flavor being pre-ground.

Also, I usually prefer to buy coffee beans, but I was able to find Intense only ground. I was afraid it would not be as fresh tasting because of that, but that is not the case at all. This coffee is one of the best I've had!

review/summary: Not like the restaurant version
review/text: If you have fallen in love with the Douwe Egbert coffee you get at restaurants with its distinctive flavor, don't expect this packaged for home version to match up.  It tastes just like average coffee- not at all like what you may be familiar with in public establishments...

review/summary: This Is A Coffee Drinkers Coffee
review/text: I am particular about my coffee and I have tried just about all of them. Somehow the ones that I have drunk and liked in the past seemed to change...or maybe it is just me.  I like a strong black coffee but not bitter and this fits the bill.  A smooth rich intense flavor which just makes getting out of bed a little easier.

review/summary: Simply the best coffee
review/text: My husband and I have been accused of being 'coffee snobs'...it is true! We discovered Douwe Egbert at the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego. To quote my 9-year-old daughter, "It smells like peanut butter and tastes like joy." This is the best coffee I have ever tasted! I asked our server for the brand and ordered some as soon as we were home. The price is not bad compared to other higher-end brands, and the taste exceeds anything I have tried in the past. Honestly, any other brand that I liked in the past is a disappointment now. DE is well worth the money.

review/text: The first time I had this coffee, was at the country club and I thought it had great flavor.  I asked them the brand and they told me Douwe Egberts.  Of course, I had never heard of it.  You do,however, have to be careful of the quantities you use to make it taste as good as possible, so follow the directions, but also, do not be afraid to experiment with the coffee to water ratios.  Enjoy!

review/summary: WOW, a fantastic coffee.
review/text: Finally I have found the coffee I want.  Was a Senseo pod user for years until Senseo took a vacation on USA shipments of coffee pods.....  Since I liked the Senseo coffee I quickly realized I could get the taste I wanted finally right here with Amazon sub and save program.  I tried the ROOD coffee first and liked it but found it to be lacking in taste.  This intense dark roast was just what i needed.  The coffee looks many stages darker than the rood coffee and delivers the expected full body flavor.  I use this with my new top of the line Mr. Coffee carafe brewer.  I use on spoon for every cup I brew.  This coffee is wonderful.  Price is fantastic and with the sub and save program I am never going to be out of Douwe Egberts coffee again.<br />ps...... checked local stores for this item.  most don't even have it and the one that did only sold one little package at a time at a very high price.  Thanks

review/summary: MAYBE NOT FOR THE STARBUCK GENERATION
review/text: My wife (European) and I (US) have been foertunate enough to do a lot of business and personal international travelling.  Our tastes are open to almost anything new except when it comes to coffee (and tea for me).  Our coffee of choice is Douwe Egberts Intense.  This is the only coffee we have found in the US that is ground fine enough (finer than "supermarket" espresson grind) to let the full flavor and aroma out.  If you can find a grinder with a sufficiently fine grinding setting you might notice, as we have, that lesser brands of coffee tend to taste much better.<br /><br />Starbuck's coffees, for me, can have a good taste of coffee but the acidic after-taste turns me off.

review/text: I'm so thrilled to find Douwe Egberts online.  One of my favorite coffees.  The Intense Dark Roast is rich and full bodied with no bitterness.  I like the three pack because I was able to share with a friend who called to let me know how much she enjoyed this coffee as well.  I would like to see it in whole bean as I normally prefer to grind my own but this coffee is wonderful and I will continue to purchase it.

review/text: I first discovered this coffee while dining at a local restaurant. Let me preface this by saying I am a total coffee snob. This coffee is, by far, the best cup of coffee I've ever had. It is bold but is absent that "bite" you normally experience with many of the bold flavored coffees. The downside is that it is a bit pricey.

review/text: My order was sold by Deeva Fulfillment Services, Inc. and fulfilled by Amazon.<br /><br />The cardamom was very roughly ground, full of threads throughout, and not very potent.  So, you can get the wonderful cardamom flavor from it, but you have to use a lot more to do so, defeating the value of the great price.  And you'll be left with some tough "husk" shreds in your mouth.

It was a really good deal considering I bought a 8 pack for 4 or 5 dollars at the local grocery store.  The expiration or best by date was far off to so that you don't feel rushed to get them all eaten before they become stale.

review/summary: Tastes GREAT and can be Diabetic Friendly
review/text: I love this trail mix but I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in January of 2012. I thought I'd have to give up these kinds of snacks but I've found I can still have them if I add more nuts so I add almonds and pecans.<br /><br />I admit it's a bit of a pain to snip open all the little bags but it's worth it to get a snack that I don't worry will spike my blood sugar. I just open the little bags, add about 10-12 oz of roasted almonds and about 1/2 that amount of pecan pieces and I "repackage" in small tupperware or gladware containers. The amount I get is between 1/4 and 1/2 a cup which I think is a decent amount for a snack and I can pretty much have this every day.<br /><br />I'm happy I didn't have to completely give these up and at the time of this writing, the price that Amazon offers is even better than Walmart.

review/text: These are about on par with my local grocery stores generic brand; I subscribed to these on Amazon since they're cheaper, and easier to control portions.  My only complaint would be that many of the bags have been more raisin than anything else - as in, a bag would consist of almost nothing except raisins.  Might've just been bad luck though, as it hasn't been consistent.

review/text: I played in a golf tournament where these were included in a little snack bag in the cart.  After about 11 holes and 14 beers I decided I was hungry enough to give them a shot.  Wow, they were way better than I expected.  I'm not a trail mix type of guy so they didn't sound that great, but next week at the office I was browsing the snack machine and saw them in there, so I gave them a sober shot and they were as good as I remembered, but they were like $1.25 a bag.  When I got home I ordered a big old box of them for my office.

(Which is a good thing, meaning it is well-protected during shipping.)  When I came over and saw it, I had expected some little twig in some ugly pot.  To my pleasant surprise, it was a beautiful, bushy, adult-looking tree in a pretty blue pot complete with moss, some small plant, and a rock!  The pot came with a dish and white stones for underneath -- it looks like a work of art!  The tree came with tweezers and bonsai food and I don't know what else (since my boyfriend received it).  I definitely recommend this to anyone interested in having (or giving) a cute little tree for your or someone else's home/office/whatever.  It's adorable!

review/summary: What kind of tea is this?
review/text: I got excited when I saw this in the tea collection at work.  Jasmine Green Tea?  I love Jasmine Green Tea!  So I had a cup ... and it was awful.  I thought maybe I somehow had a bad cup, so I tried a different tea bag ...  yuck.<br /><br />It's hard to describe just how bad this tastes.  Imagine a cup of green tea that someone poured some jasmine-scented perfume into.  Or maybe dissolved some jasmine-flavored candy into.  I saw someone say it was Pez flavored, and I can agree with that. But no matter how you describe it, it is undrinkable.  Second cup was poured down the sink.<br /><br />And it isn't just the initial taste.  Somehow this coats your tongue and the badness sticks with you.  I suspect this box is going to be sitting around the office for a long, long time.

review/summary: Doesn't taste right.
review/text: I agree with a previous reviewer on the Pez taste.  There are definitely some fruity hints here that do not belong to Jasmine Green.  I bought this as I ran out of Jasmine Phoenix Pearl (loose) tea quite some time ago and wanted to get back into tea drinking with the colder weather upon us.<br /><br />This is unlike any "green" tea I've had.. it's like someone left a lollypop from Halloween in your cup for a minute.  Fruity-fake. I don't like it at all.  I'm looking for the strong presence of Jasmine flowers with a slight bitter after-taste associated with the tannins in the green tea.  That is not here... slight green tea taste, fruity hints, no bitterness whatsoever.  Very Disappointed.<br /><br />I feel GoodEarth is misrepresenting their product here.  It clearly states "Jasmine Green Tea" and that is what I expect.

review/summary: Not true Jasmine flavor
review/text: I bought a box of this tea before I realized it was Good Earth brand. I have tried a few of their tea flavors much in the past, and  there is something in the ambiguous "natural flavors" in their tea that I just don't like.<br /><br />That was the case with this "Jasmine" tea, as well. If you are looking for a clean and true jasmine flavor, DO NOT BUY THIS TEA! I would give this tea 1 star if I were rating it on the basis of the jasmine flavor alone.  That said, when I drank the tea with no expectation of jasmine flavor, I found that I actually  liked it!<br /><br />Overall, it's an ok tea. I probably wouldn't buy it again, though.

review/summary: Best Tea I've ever had
review/text: Who knew tea could be so polarizing?  I'm shocked by the amount of negative reviews on this tea.<br /><br />I tasted this tea once and was immediately blown away, it is the best tea I've ever had.  I've had many different brands of jasmine green tea, and I always enjoy it.  This is no normal jasmine green tea, however.  Normally jasmine green tea has the recognizable taste of green tea with the slight hint of something flowery.  You can smell the jasmine more than taste it.  This tea does not taste like any other jasmine green tea.  Whereas jasmine green tea is typically light with faint flavor, the Good Earth jasmine green tea is robust.  The flavor is rich and indulgent, it almost tastes like a dessert tea.  The jasmine flavor does not shy away in the distance, but is upfront and shares the taste evenly with the green tea leaves.  I can see how it might not be for everyone, but if you have a palette anything like mine you will fall in love with it.  I drink a cup of this tea every single morning, and I've never grown tired of it.  The thought of it gets me out of bed in the mornings.  It is also delicious as an iced tea.  And to counter what other reviewers have erroneously said, it contains no sweeteners and no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives.  Though it tastes so good I can see why people would assume it does! I love that I found something that tastes devilishly good yet is full of antioxidants and gives me a boost of energy.  Try it, and don't expect it to taste like typical jasmine green tea.  It is in a class of its own.

review/text: This is good tea. I like the individual tea bag wraps because it keeps it very fresh. I love the taste of the green tea in this product but the Jasmine is lacking. There's a slight Jasmine presence but not that lush, full bodied Jasmine taste and smell. I once had the best Jasmine tea at a local downtown Los Angeles dim sum restaurant and have been searching for that taste ever since. If anyone has a Jasmine tea recommendation I'd sure like to know about it.

review/summary: This Does NOT Taste Like Jasmine Green Tea!
review/text: This smells like jasmine green tea somewhat, but it gives off an odor more akin to cheap jasmine perfume.  It dominates the palate, with its too sweet scent which unavoidably come through with the taste of this tea.  I love a good cup of jasmine tea and I have tried many of them.  This does NOT taste like any of the quality jasmine green teas I have had before.  I got this because I thought it would be an easier way to brew tea at work instead of the loose stuff.  Boy what a mistake.  I now have a box of this stuff, minus one tea bag, sitting in my desk never to be used.  If you enjoy quality jasmine teas, do not get this tea!

Think extra large "granola style clusters" but with only nuts and no granola. Absolutely delicious. This is our second purchase of this brand (we've tried the Pistachio/Blueberry/Pomegranite type which is also good) and we'll definitely buy more. We dislike Sahale because their bizarre combinations are overpowering, but we love the earthy natural crunch of Mareblu.

review/summary: Best in Class Dry Dog Food
review/text: Pet food has an immense range of quality that you can very roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars); (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product (3-4 stars); and (3) "price is no object" foods that make no compromises (5-6 stars).  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog food anywhere.  Period.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with the highest quality ingredients you'll ever find in dog food.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food there is.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product:  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for "hill's science diet dry dog food."  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.

review/summary: beware of this food
review/text: About a year ago I decided to put my dog on a better food as she was (at the time) 11 yeas old and I want her to live the longest, healthiest life possible, much like everyone else, as she is not just a pet to me but also a daughter. I stopped at my local "mom & pop" pet food store and asked some questions. I knew little about the better brands as she's always been on grocery store brands. I was directed toward Orijen as it is one of the better brands out there, it's very high in protein, you can understand all of the ingredients and it's "so healthy, a human could eat it". Of course I bought it, and my dog loved it. Little did I know how damaging the food was to her, as quite honestly, she exhibited no symptoms. Back in January my dog had to be put in the ICU due to an accident. It was during that stay where the vet noticed how high her liver levels were. Her alkaline & phosphatase as well as her calcium levels in the kidneys were all very high as well. The vet put her on 3 different liver support medicines and we had to follow up every month with more blood work to reassess the situation. After the 3rd month, the vet was suspicious that cancer was present. When I hear that, I immediately did some research on the food. It was then that I noticed how high the protein content is and what that much protein could do to a body. I presented my research and concerns to the vet, who wasn't as convinced as I was. After the 4th blood draw, and still no changes, we made the mutual decision to wean her off of Orijen and on to Science Diet (although just about any other brand would have worked too). A month later after the switch, and my dog was presented with a clean bill of health. Her alkaline & phosphatase levels are still slightly elevated, but I'm told there is nothing to worry about now. We concluded it was the food that was damaging and slowly killing her, as she was deemed healthy at the start of feeding her the food, A few months prior to all of this, she went though a full work up in order to get her teeth cleaned.<br /><br />I write this not to slander Orijen, I only want to educate others on my own personal experience. While it happened to my dog, that doesn't mean it will effect all dogs the same. Just please keep in mind, my dog showed no symptoms while on the food that anything was wrong. If it weren't for her stay in the hospital, we never would have known how much damage this food was causing her. If your dog is presently on this food, maybe a precautionary blood draw at their next exam would be worth your while.

At first I thought maybe she needs to adjust to it comparied to her old food but after the second bag I couldn't take it anymore. There was no way that anyone could not be in the same room - I was concerned if the high protein content was making it hard for her to digest since she is an older dog.

review/summary: Best grain free dog food you can buy
review/text: Orijen makes by far the best dog food you can buy. It's expensive but well worth it, especially when you take into account how much you will save on vet bills and the great boost it will give to your dogs overall health and well being.. It is grain free which is very important as grain is not part of a dog's normal diet and besides mostly being filler, grains can cause allergies and other issues. My 5 year old German Shepherd is on Orijen Adult and has done incredibly well on it, stunning coat, great energy, consistently firm, and virtually odor-free, poops. I also have a large male Golden who is now 13 1/2 years old and doing fantastic. He at Orijen Senior until about 3 years ago when we switched him to Orijen Senior. Other than a little arthritis in his hips and knees (to be expected) he is perfectly healthy and his last blood panel came back incredibly good. My vet says we are doing all the right things (daily walks and exercise, filtered water, Orijen Senior food) especially since large Goldens typically only live to 10 or 11. When we are out walking quite often we meet much younger goldens (6 to 8 years) that look much older than he does. It really does show what a difference diet and exercise make both in humans and in our canine companions. We have a new puppy (that we adopted from the Best Friends Animal Society) and she is on a mix of Orijen Puppy and doing great. Highly recommend Orijen Adult, Senior and Puppy.<br /><br />Note:<br />Many years ago we fed our dogs Canidae because it was decent quality and we were financial limited. But, when the Canidae manufacturer suddenly changed their formula (added more grain and fillers) all of our dogs had bad reactions (diarrhea, vomiting, scratching, skin allergies etc). Numerous trips to the vet and lots of dollars for tests only to find out they were all having a reaction to the poor quality ingredients in their food. That was when I began researching dog food ingredients and decided to go grain-free with a company that only makes dog food. Could not be happier with my decision to spend more on Orijen. Very wise decision on my part, and my dogs are much healthy now than they have ever been.

review/summary: The best hard candy I've ever had
review/text: I had read great things about these candies, but was hesitant to fork out for a 7-lb bag. But, getting bored of the artificial taste of sour Jolly Ranchers, I decided to take the plunge. Also, it was October - if worse came to worst, they would become expensive Halloween candy.<br /><br />Well, the trick-or-treaters lose out - these are the best hard candies I've ever had. Despite the name, they aren't very sour. The exterior is like your usual hard candy, except with flavors that taste very natural and aren't cloying. In the middle is strip of sour sugar. After you've been sucking on the candy for a little while, the interior will start to leak out, and you get a trickle of sourness that mixes with the flavor or hard candy. The sourness runs out well before the candy is gone. While this may sound corny, the sourness in the middle prevents the candy from becoming boring, unlike most sucking candies.<br /><br />Even that center sour part isn't incredibly sour, or at least doesn't seem so at the rate it leaks out. Probably if you bit into the candy and released it all at once it would be much stronger. Sucking on it, it never gets more sour than, say, a Sour Patch Kid.<br /><br />All of the flavors taste great. I slightly prefer the pineapple, tangerine, and cherry over the lemon and line, just because they're a bit more exotic. However, all of them are easily recognizable, and none are overpowering.<br /><br />As a last note: while the candies are colored, they don't use anything like the quantity of dye in many American candies. After eating some flavors of Jolly Ranchers, I'm embarrassed to go out of the house because my tongue is so blue! Napoleon bon bons are much better in that regard.

review/text: Naturade's Bavarian Chocolate flavor is outstanding.  I've been taking this product for breakfast and lunch at work since about September 2005, and I'm not sick of it yet.  Not even close.  I'll consume as much as I want during the day when I want.  I feel completely full for a few hours with one drink. I mix it in a 20 ounce bottle with two scoops.  Your body will appreciate the health benefits of this drink, unlike fried or fast food that will take down your energy level and leave you feeling groggy.  You will lose weight also from taking this product.  I lost 20 pounds and am now at a level of maintaining my current weight, and I owe a lot to Naturade Soy.  I've also tried the Vanilla flavor.  I was not impressed. Buy the Bavarian Chocolate and try it out.  You'll be glad you did.

review/text: I'm not a big fan of the taste. I've tried mixing it with water (as instructed) and with soy milk. It just doesn't taste very good to me, but not bad. For an easy vegan meal replacement, it does the trick, and the price is good. I'll try the vanilla next, as that might mix well with some fruit in the blender.
