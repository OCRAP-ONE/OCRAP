review/summary: Extremely bitter!
review/text: I don't know if I might have got a bad bag, but the stuff I got was terrible. It tasted like unsweetened grapefruit and other weird things. I went back and read the ingredient list and no grapefruit. I can't figure out what makes it so bitter. The ads say its a sweet drink.... Don't waste your money.

review/summary: Perfect for a picky eater!
review/text: My Chihuahua is a very particular dog when it comes to her food. I brought her home for the first time when she was six weeks old, and as soon as she was old enough to eat treats, I bought her a box of dog biscuits. She wouldn't touch them. No matter what brand of biscuit my dog was offered, if it was shaped like a little bone and was crunchy she wouldn't touch it. I even purchased some special home made biscuits from a dog specialty bakery that were coated in dog safe icing. She licked the icing off and left the biscuit. She won't even eat milkbones.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when she received one of these treats from my Uncle before I could warn him that she doesn't eat dog biscuits. My dog wolfed it down so fast I almost missed her eating it! I don't know what she loves about these things so much more than other biscuits, but she loves them! I'm glad I've finally found a dog treat that she'll eat that isn't bad for her.

This rum cake is famous and renowned in the world of rum cake lovers.<br /><br />Anybody calling this junk, obviously is not coherent IF one is a true rum cake lover. I'd HIGHLY recommend trying this before investing your time in making one. I have successfully made this with a good quality gold rum and with a spiced rum.

review/summary: Rum Yum
review/text: I usually make homemade rum cakes for Christmas gifts.  This Christmas (2011) my schedule was hectic, so I decided to purchase the Tortuga Caribbean Gold Bar Rum Cake instead of baking.  I bought several as gifts, but I also bought one for myself to try out (taste test).  This rum cake is moist, light, and there is rum generously soaking the bottom of the cake.  DELICIOUS.  I was tempted to not give out the gifts and eat all the cakes, but relented and decided I could order more for my own pleasure.  I highly recommend this as a gift - or be selfish and enjoy the cake all to yourself.

review/text: The Tortuga Caribbean Gold Bar Rum Cake is very good.  For some reason, it tastes better than the same version in the round cake form.  I have no clue why, but the rum taste is a little stronger and the cake is rather buttery.  It actually reminds me of the Blackbeard Rum Cake in Cayman which isn't available online anywhere outside of Cayman.  The Blackbeard cake is better, but this Gold Bar Rum cake is very close and is flavored better than the round cake version made by Tortuga.

When I tried to return this to Amazon, they declined saying that too much time had passed to return it (about a month).<br /><br />Unfortunately this has turned me off of Lick Your Chops brand.  They were clearly dented before they were shipped, not by Amazon.  Is their quality control that bad?<br /><br />Lesson learned:  when purchasing a case, open it immedately; perhaps I could have returned it then.<br /><br />I regret not being able to give the product more stars as the food inside has been historically good.

review/summary: Wasabi is a flavor, not a color.
review/text: I love wasabi and I was thrilled to find such an unusual product as wasabi flavored jelly beans. I couldn't wait for their arrival. They came quick enough and I rushed home to open the package and dive into one of my favorite flavors. I popped a few in my mouth and waited for the classic burn (remember to breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth) - here it goes....nothing. I popped a few more in my mouth. Nothing again. No wasabi flavor whatsoever!!! They might as well have been labeled honeydew mellon. To say the least I was disappointed. Then I thought maybe I misunderstood and the wasabi was a color and not a flavor - maybe so. Nonetheless, if you're looking for a new way to experience the wonderful kick of wasabi, look elsewhere. These jelly beans are only sweet with no other distinguishable flavor. Nice idea, poorly executed.

review/summary: Cookie Decorations
review/text: These sugar cookie ornaments are no longer available in my state (Florida), after being used for decades, somebody decided that the silver on the "Silver Dragees" was not a substance that should be consumed.  I have been making Christmas cookies for 40 years using them to decorate sugar cookies and Spritz wreath shaped butter cookies, and searched everywhere for them.  I was very happy to find them here at Amazon.  My traditional Christmas cookies will once again, look like they always did, and my family members are all still alive and well, after consuming them for decades.  Happy Holidays..........

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: The description for this item is not accurate. I bought the freeze deied raspberries and stawberries from this same company and they are great. However, these are dehydrated which means 2 important things:<br /><br />- Texture: these are very hard and do not soften if left in milk or water. Don't think about adding these to cereal, only for trail mix or eating out of hand.<br /><br />- Saturated fat: the second ingredient is coconut oil! One 2oz. serving has 190 calories, 19 grams of fat and 16 grams of saturated fat. You're better off eating Cheetos.<br /><br />These are extremely unhealthy and don't even taste that great. There is (unsurprisingly) and oily aftertaste. Buyer beware. Stick to purely freeze dried fruits - nothing is added and they are healthy.

review/summary: good banana chips
review/text: i felt the need to defend these banana chips, which i don't feel deserve a one star rating.  i got them in a #10can -case pack (6 different items) of various dehydrated fruits from honeyville farms, and i think they taste just like banana chips you buy at the supermarket in small packs, or mixed with trail mix.  they are not the freeze-dried kind, mind you, which honeyville also sells, but the dehydrated, slightly oily variety that are a bit crunchy.  i find i eat these by the cupful sometimes, and must remember to drink something!  they are very sweet and satisfying.  my kids really like them too.<br /><br />a yr. later-- i wanted to add that I continue to get these delish banana chips.  i also would like to explain that i don't eat many sweets (I think craisins are a bit too sweet to eat alone), so the "very sweet" comment for me is just kinda sweet for many people. I also use coconut oil extensively at home for the taste and health properties (along with olive oil and butter), so the coconut oil in these chips was just an added bonus.<br /><br />I highly recommend these chips.  Honeyville makes freeze dried banana chips as well, if you like that texture better. i just like these, because they remain crispy and tasty (vs. getting mushy faster with freeze-dried products you don't re-vacuum seal)

review/summary: Great for snacking
review/text: I never got around to trying to bake with these because I just used them as a snack rather than regular chips or sweets.  I think these would be great in trail mix or just plain as I've been eating them.  I don't eat massive quantities of them, so I'm not concerned about the coconut oil or the small amount of sugar added.  I just eat them to take the edge off hunger sometimes between meals.  Honeyville does sell freeze-dried bananas though if you're concerned about additives.

review/text: This 6-Pack sampler lets you savor 6 different tastes of the Caribbean Rum Cakes! Truthfully, I like every single flavor. I was thinking that the Key Lime would be absolutely sickening but it turned out to be my favorite one. These cakes will appear small to you but I reccomend buying this instead of one 33oz cakes incase you may not like that flavor. With this sampler you get to try each one and decide which is your favorite, which then you can go ahead and purchase the 33oz of whatever flavor is your liking.<br /><br />Overall - EXCELLENT (If you like Rum)

I even gave one to the maintenance person who came to fix my oven the day before Christmas.<br />Do yourself a favor, order a lot and keep them around. I will warn you now...it is hard not to eat them yourself.

review/summary: Tortuga rum cake 6-pk sampler
review/text: These cakes are so good and moist. I suggest having a glass of milk with them or you might have a hard time talking. The rum is strong but it is nice and smooth. The cake is sweet and creamy. I have only tried the 'Golden Original' so far, the other 5 flavors sound really good, and I can't wait to open them up.<br /><br />These are packaged beautifully, and would make great gifts as well. The cakes are roughly the size of a really fat donut. They are perfect to split with someone else. I wouldn't suggest eating the entire sampler box of 6, you might get more than a buzz from these. So you probably shouldn't bring these to work, or you might get in trouble.<br /><br />I will definitely order these again, or probably a larger cake next time.

Key lime was definitely much better than I expected.<br />Note that the individual cake packets are not suited for more than 2 people.<br />Price for this 6 pack on the cruise ship was $25+, about one $ less than what Amazon carries this for.

Most recently, I needed something for my Dad, who lives 1000 miles away. This is the same brand he had purchased while on a cruise, so I knew it would be welcome -- tasty and a source of nice memories too! And what could be better than six different flavors, each in a size quite suitable for a single person. The package arrived in 2 days, nice and fresh and yummy thanks to my Amazon Prime delivery.

We recently ran out of all of our frozen goodies so we got these. We are normally creatures of habit but figured this would be a good way to try other flavors. Some of them (that I wasn't used to) seem extra rum infused than other and the "flavor" of each one wasn't as strong as I would have liked but they are still yummy. If you LOVE rum though; you will LOVE these.

I guess I will have to go to the Caymen Islands to get the full experience.

review/text: I always worry when folks not from the southwest start cooking with jalapenos.  As a rule, they call mildly spicy foods by adjectives like BOLD.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong -- these are really good almonds. And they're soooo fresh they practically explode when you bite into them.  I intend to buy more.  But they've got just the smallest, itty-bittiest bit of jalapeno flavor to them.  And after the first two or three -- you can't even taste it at all, so basically it is a handful of smoked almonds.<br /><br />So far, all these "bold" varieties I've tried have been good.  But as far as I can tell, "bold" is just show-business for "our newest flavors."

review/summary: Very solid bold coffee
review/text: I order this item consistently for my office. Everyone here seems to enjoy the flavor of this coffee. Its bold, and strong, and comes out great from the K-Cup. As with all K-cup products, its not a premium/gourmet coffee from a top roaster and brewer, but it really makes us happy here at work when a K-cup is all that we can produce.

review/summary: FINALLY!
review/text: Got a Keurig for Christmas, and have spent the past two months trying to find great coffee that is also affordable.  Over a dollar each for the ones that I was getting at the grocery store was just not cutting it for me.  I purchased a reusable K-cup.  Couldn't stomach the weak coffee it made, and that was with superfine ground coffee.  Not to mention that it often only brewed half a cup.  So, after trying many different types, I decided I liked the taste of the Starbucks Sumatra the best, but it was way too expensive.  Come to find out, Green Mountain makes the Starbucks K-cups.  So I decided to try Green Mountain, as it is MUCH more affordable.<br />It's GREAT!  Nice, strong, flavorful cup of coffee!  FINALLY!

review/summary: Just about my favorite K-Cup coffee so far
review/text: Got a Keurig for Christmas, so I've been having fun trying the wide variety of available K-Cup products.  So far, this is my favorite of all the coffees, and one of the few I'd stack up against a good cup of freshly ground and brewed regular coffee. Usually I like K-Cups because they're convenient.  I like these because they're truly excellent coffee and taste wonderful.  These and Coffee People's extra bold varieties are good enough to pass for the real thing - no one would ever suspect they were K-Cups if you didn't tell them.

review/text: Finally a good strong cup of coffee.  After drinking weak, flavorless K-cups I found this one.  It has a very strong, smooth, almost floral taste with no weird afertaste like some bold coffee.  I highly recomend this coffee especially if you are a true coffee junkie.  Trust me you will love it!

review/text: I like this brand. I didn't realize I was ordering extra bold. To me these T cups are bitter. Since I can't control the strength, I make a small cup and toss. Then I make a large cup to drink. It is still strong which I like, but still has a bit of bitter aftertaste. I still like this brand.

review/text: I put cream and sugar in my coffee, but I like one with bold flavor that shines through. I have tried other extra bold k-cups and come back to this one. Great taste, bold but not bitter. I only wish that the green mountain coffee would be offered as a subscribe and save item. Now that they are selling k-cups at Costco, I am tempted regularly to move to the lines they carry. It would be nice not to worry about running out, and to be rewarded a bit for my loyalty!

review/text: I enjoy the other strong ("extra bold") K-Cup varieties such as Jet Fuel and Black Tiger, but the Double Black Diamond is just too bitter. I add one packet of sugar or Xagave to this coffee and the sweetness barely comes through. My co-workers don't like Jet Fuel so I will stick to Black Tiger and try the new Starbucks K-Cups.

review/summary: Excellent bold cup of coffee.
review/text: Let me start by saying I like French roast, pressed coffee. I was purchasing 1 lb. S***bucks French roast and having it ground for the press weekly. This coffee, GM Double Black Diamond (k-cup) and Gevalia Dark Italian Roast (Tassimo)come so close I do not purchase the ground coffee any longer. Very strong, full bodied coffee without being bitter or having an aftertaste. If you like strong, fresh coffee this is it.

review/text: I make my coffee like an ersatz latte and need a very robust coffee to pull that off---this fits the bill.  This is my method:  using a large mug, I first pour in about 1/4 c. of milk and nuke that for 60 seconds.  I then use either the small or medium (depends on my mood) Keurig setting and brew the coffee with the scalded milk, then top with a dollop of Bailey's coffee creamer.  Delicious!  I like a strong coffee but not a bitter one and Double Black Diamond works beautifully.
