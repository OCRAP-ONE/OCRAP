review/summary: Perfect K-Cup Sampler!!!!
review/text: I was very, very nervous ordering this after seeing some of the terrible reviews but I figured for the cost it'd be worth a shot to see what happens.  My husband and I have vastly different tastes in coffee/teas.  He is very, very picky about his coffee (Tully's seems to be the ongoing favorite) and I like anything fru fru and flavored.  Oh and tea.  LOVE the teas!  So I figured between the two of us we should like something?<br /><br />We got almost every single cup pictured and not a single duplicate cup!  While there are a few english breakfast teas they are by various companies and since I'm a tea lover I don't mind this in the least!  Easy way to find out which brand I'll like best before committing to a full box!  The box was a bit jumbled but that was OK with us since there wasn't any explosions.  I really feel there's the perfect blend here between hard-core coffees, fru fru coffees and teas.  I can't wait to dive into this pack.<br /><br />Regarding the expirations - almost all of mine are expiring in August which is 6 months away and I feel is definitely fair given that there are a few boxes I purchased in December that are already expiring!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this pack and I would purchase this without hesitation for friends getting a new Keurig.  It's a great way to try stuff without committing to a huge box!

review/summary: Lots of Tea
review/text: Of the k-cups listed (pictured) I didn't get eight, considering is says "assortment may vary" I didn't find this terribly objectionable.  However of the eight replacements, four were English Breakfast teas, two were other teas, and two were other duplicates. Keep in mind four Breakfast Teas are pictured, so I got a total of eight. This seemed like an opportunity for them to dump less desirable options and I am guessing tea's fit that bill.  In total I got way more tea than than I ever would have suspected and definitely would not have ordered had I known the actual assortment ahead of time.  Cheers ;)

review/summary: Very disappointed in the packaging
review/text: It just looks like someone bought a bunch of random k-cup packs and through individual cups into a box, slapped on some tape, and marked up the price a bit.  The k-cups were just floating free in a long, white box.  There was plenty of open space in the box so they weren't shipped securely at all.  Luckily none of them burst open.  We purchased this as a gift and ended up having to arrange these ourselves in a different box so it didn't look cheesy.  I just hope the various coffee is decent.  Finally, be prepared for several teas and a few decaf coffees.  So a little less than 30 are regular coffee.

review/summary: Lots of Fun!!
review/text: I loved this sampler pack. My coffees and Teas were all fresh and full of flavor. I had a great time picking and choosing my Kcup from the box each day. I even found a few new flavors that I now keep stocked year round. If you are looking for the perfect gift for coffee/tea lover, or are throwing a party that requires coffee/tea, then this is the perfect product for you. If you are expecting to love every flavor or only drink a specific type of coffee/tea then this is not for you.<br /><br />I loved this sampler pack and would try other Kcup sampler packs. Be aware that this product does contain tea (not a symbolic 1 or 2 tea Kcups) and can be a ton of fun trying out flavors from around the world.

review/summary: Tour the world from your mug!
review/text: I'm a huge coffee lover and was skeptical to buy this product. There are a few types of coffee that I like and it's hard to break away and try something new. So I figured that it makes sense to buy it, try it, and find new flavors that are consistent with my tastes. Boy, what a journey!<br />The packaging seems a little simple for a product at this level - but it's very easy to forgive considering the work it takes to add such a variety to one box.<br />I must say before I give my rave review - that if you want specific flavors and are hoping to find them in this box - you're not going to get it. There is a nice list of flavors from different countries and a big mix of tea's as well. You know what you're getting when you buy it.<br />So here's the deal about a cool variety pack like this: you can be strategic about how you will conquer all the flavors within. I wanted a strong bold start - so I jumped into a cup of India Spice Chai Tea. It goes without saying that it was nothing short of delicious. Over the course of the next few weeks, I began with what I thought would be mellow (Breakfast in Bed) flavors and worked my way up to the last cup in the box (Jet Fuel). Every day is a there is something different. Every cup tells the story about a country. From this package, you don't have to travel the world. You can taste what a country is like from their coffee - all from the comfort of your kitchen table.<br />I loved this, have bought it for others, and recommend it to others! Enjoy!

review/text: This whole Keurig K Cups concept is an awesome one.  I can't believe it wasn't invented much sooner.  I finally decided to get one and accessorized it with a stand and different K-cups, etc...  It is so much easier and faster to make a quick cup when you need just one.  Tastes great too.<br />The only issue I had with this selection were a few of the packs, didn't taste very good.  That's standard with coffee in general.  I have enjoyed about 99% of the flavors in this sampler pack.

review/summary: Not thrilled with this one
review/text: I've liked most of the crazy cups variety packs.  This one is mostly powdered hot chocolate cups from grove square and cafe escapes.  You neither need a keurig nor to spend 50c-$1.00 a cup for that, you just need a cup, a 15c pack of cocoa, and a microwave or really hot tap water.  The coffee included is largely green mountain and a lot of that is mocha fudge nut.  Couple of chocolate donut cups.  Besides being expensive and unnecessary, the powder filled cups can even clog the nozzle on the brewer.

review/text: I feel like the world sampler was pretty good especially since I was prepared for just a "grab bag" of cups based on others feedback. I did get pretty close to what the picture shows of different types and brands of tea and coffee. I don't mind that there were multiple french roasts/columbian roasts since different brands might taste differently. I think product might be better for someone who is newer to Keurig and wants to be exposed to what is out there or would be a nice variety for party/company.

Green Mountain and the Bigelow teas are solid performers. Wolfgang Puck is okay but there are just too many "extra bold" in here for me to give this 5 stars. Still haven't tried the really exotic ones yet like Kenya blend or "jet fuel". Overall, one nice mix for the price even if its not too well rounded.

review/text: First I have to say that I am glad this arrived - When I opened the package I expected another package of k-cups rather a varity pack. No! Instead what I did find was a bunch of random k-cups carelessly tossed in with no real care. I am hesitant to use them as they have been handeled by another person or persons and for all I know these k-cups could in some way be tampered with not being properly packaged! Personally my first impression upon opening this was much like a bottle of OTC meds - there is the label that states "do not use if seal is broken" well as I mention... where is the rest of the packaging? I think that I am probably going to just throw them out as there was no packing slip and since this was suppose to be a gift to go with a Keurig coffee maker I would be highly embarrassed to give this as a gift.

review/summary: Good variety and giftable packaging as of 12/31/11
review/text: I really liked the idea of trying so many coffee flavors to see what we'd like with our new brewer.  On receipt today, I was delighted with the variety and also the packaging for this item.  (I saw the prior review about the cups being thrown in a  box.... it appears they've fixed that issue... it was in a presentation-type cardboard box with bamboo and coffee cup motif.  You open the top and then can see each cup to choose from.)  Now I'm thinking of sending one of these as a birthday gift later in the year.  Nice product!

review/summary: Very Happy
review/text: I am very happy with this selection!  There were a lot of flavors I actually wanted to try and a few I didn't even know existed.  I may just continue buying this selection instead of buying several boxes of the same thing over and over again.  The price is fair, for sure.  There were a few tea selections included and I really like those.  My ONLY complaint is that a couple of the K Cups expire in a couple of months and although I don't think that will be a problem in the long run, I prefer mine to expire further out.  We normally only use the K Cups on occasions or when a large pot just won't do us at home.  But the variety of the sampler really makes up for those few cups with shorter expiration times.  Everything was still within the date, so that's good :)

review/summary: HORRIBLE
review/text: This is a horrible horrible horrible vendor. The k-cup variety pack was not boxed, it was just thrown in a packing box. The k-cups were beat up and looked like they were old and had been through a tornado. I can not believe that this vendor would put such a dismal package together. I don't know how fresh or new these k-cups are and I am afraid to use them. Apparently, these were someone's leftovers that they are trying to dump on unsuspecting customers. You should be ashamed of yourself. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR! This is my first amazon disaster. I will rethink purchasing from Amazon in the future.

review/summary: Where to begin!
review/text: Yes, I read the reviews and I thought I would give it a chance.  This box was filled with a very nice mix of coffees, no not all what they advertise. The top two that I looked forward too, Wolf Gangpuck Bed in Breakfast and Rodeo Drive, were not in my box.<br /><br />Pros: Quick shipping, Decent selection of coffees.<br /><br />Cons: Did not send 35 cups. Did not include all flavors advertised or send suitable replacements in box.  Box marked for March 2012 expiration(purchased Feb. 2012).  K-cups are thrown in box, no plastic bag or left over k-cups box to stop them from coming damaged.  Not a gift able item.<br /><br />This is absolutely a buyer beware purchase!<br /><br /> In conclusion, I would say a great big thank you to Amazon for helping me with some of these issues.<br />PS. Not even they could get me 35 cups or a better expiration date.

review/summary: Good When I finally recieved the correct item
review/text: I ordered this a few weeks ago and the first package was the incorrect item. I believe another review refers to the same thing I received. A cardboard book instead of the wooden photo box. I immediately called Amazon when I received the first item and they were really helpful. They explained I could not ship it back because it was food but gave me a full refund and to try purchasing the item again. The second order was the correct item and is as described. Its not a really fancy box or anything but it works for a decent gift. I would recommend it as a nice thoughtful gift when you actually get the correct item. It actually worked out well getting the wrong item first because I wasn't in a rush and got a free box of candy.

review/summary: "Box full of chocolates"
review/text: For the price, this is a nice little gift. Nothing special and of mediocre quality at most.  The glass was coming out of mine when I received it but it wasn't broken.  And don't confuse the photo and the description of a "box full of chocolates" with what is actually in the box.  The chocolates are in two small packets that will easily fit in the palm of your hand. The box is mostly filled with straw but you can't tell that from the photo. It's appropriate that the chocolates are in individual packets but I did expect there to be a bit more of them.  The product description should include a better description of that but I expect most folks aren't buying this for the chocolate anyway. I haven't tried them since I'm giving this as a gift at an office Christmas party. I's sure someone will like this very much.

review/summary: A good option for those who won't eat their veggies.
review/text: For family members who just will not eat their vegetables, this is a welcome option.  From the Campbell's website, here are the ingredients in the  Pomegranate Blueberry variety: WATER, RECONSTITUTED VEGETABLE JUICE (WATER AND CONCENTRATED JUICES OF SWEET POTATOES, PURPLE CARROTS, CARROTS), RECONSTITUTED FRUIT JUICE (WATER AND CONCENTRATED JUICES OF APPLES, POMEGRANATES, BLUEBERRIES), NATURAL FLAVORING, VITAMIN C (ASCORBIC ACID), MALIC ACID, CITRIC ACID, LEMON JUICE SOLIDS, VITAMIN E (ALPHA TOCOPHERYL ACETATE), SUCRALOSE.<br /><br />With each can comes one serving of vegetables and one serving of fruits.  A grab and go way to get a little more nutrition into the hands of those who would otherwise be drinking a carbonated beverage or other nutrient free substance.  I have found several people who will not touch a traditional V8 will drink this one.  Try the Strawberry Banana variety too.

review/text: If berry-flavored Mountain Dew sounds appealing to you, then this is your drink. Personally, I'm disgusted by this flavor and hope to return it soon; the texture is revoltingly thick and syrupy and the flavor is more grape juice than anything, though some faint berry taste does get through. It's also no healthier than regular soda pop: Although they can claim "no sugar added", the claim of "full serving and fruit and vegetables" is extremely misleading because a serving of either typically consists of a large amount of fiber and a small amount of protein, and in this drink everything but the sugar has been removed has been removed. Real stuff also has higher vitamin and mineral content. I'd consider that false advertising, since having this will only make you crave more, not feel full. I should have checked into the nutritional information before ordering. Strangely, I think it would actually be a better drink if it was diluted by half with water. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P7ZO0G">Strawberry Banana</a> flavor is much more palatable, though still somewhat overly sweet - oddly, it's less syrupy than this flavor despite having more sugar.<br /><br />Since it's difficult to find the nutrition info online:<br />Calories: 100<br />Total Fat: 0 g<br />Cholesterol: 0 mg<br />Sodium: 60 mg<br />Potassium: 280 mg<br />Total Carbs: 25 g<br />-Fiber: 0 g<br />-Sugars: 23 g<br />Protein: 0 g<br /><br />Vitamin A: 15%<br />Vitamin C: 100%<br /><br />Negligible amounts of other vitamins and minerals.

review/summary: A Delicious vegetarian soup!
review/text: I love all soups but actually found myself reaching for this one over most of the other varieties of soups I have in my cupboards.  There's lots of corn and the corn is really crisp and fresh tasting while the whole soup has a mild but delicious flavor.  It's not overloaded with vegetables like a stew would be but, for me, that adds to the desirability of it.  Being organic and low in salt is an added bonus of Amy's soups.  As with all the organic soups, they are quite expensive but when on special sale, I found this soup to be well worth the money.  I highly recommend this soup to everyone.

review/summary: Very nice soup
review/text: This is an unusually nice soup for a canned soup. Lovely flavor.  I didn't really think I could get this on amazon! So funny.  My supermarket seems to have given up on this flavor and it's the only one of Amy's soups that my 2-year-old likes... in fact, she pretty much only likes this and my chicken noodle. I find it very handy for her packed lunches (using a thermos, obviously) and adults I've tried it on like it too.  So I"m going to order...<br /><br />highly recommend if you like corn soup!

Because it's just a deodorant, it won't block or irritate your skin (the Axe antiperspirant does for me). But does seem to repel sweat a bit, not just cover up the odor (don't ask me - I just use the stuff).

review/text: We bought this McCormick California Garlic pepper at a promotion at a local grocery store.  Love the way it adds sizzle to roasts, burgers, chicken, mixed veggies, brown rice, gravy, soups etc.  When we ran out of it, couldn't find it locally so tried Amazon.  Were delighted to find it and have it back in the kitchen.  It's our go-to spice when you want basic great taste and want to spice up a dish.  This 22 oz. size lasts for a long time and is worth the price.

review/summary: Salami
review/text: My first mistake was ordering this during the summer. It did arrive in a timely fashion but it ends there. I could smell the salami before I even opened it and it didn't smell much like salami. The inside of the package was very greasy and the outside of the salami was really gross. You could see where the grease was oozing out of the ends. It smelt off, not like it was suppose to, and I know since I have had this salami before. I called the company that sold it and they kept telling me that it was fine, the heat made the grease come out and the smell was nothing. They hang salami up for months without refrigeration. After pressing him on this for about 20 min, he finally said that I could send it back at my cost, and they will check it to see if anything is wrong with it. If there is, than they will replace it but he doesn't think there is. To me, that sounds like throwing good money after bad money. So I'll be out more money and still not have a salami.

review/summary: Father-In-Law loved them
review/text: My father-in-law has been looking for Underwood sardines in tomato sauce since I married his daughter over 15 years ago.  I've looked everywhere for them.  He was always going on about how he wished he could find them.  Consumer Reports indicated they were the highest rated sardines, yadda, yadda, yadda.  You get the picture.  So in desperation I took a chance and had a case of these sent to his house.  Well long story short (believe it or not this is the short version, did I mention 15 years) he loves them.  Haven't heard one da... uh one darn thing about Underwood sardines in tomato sauce since then.  Worth EVERY penny.

review/summary: Incredible Flavor and Price - Better than Expected
review/text: These sardines are delicious - pushing the can-opener into the lid produces an invitingly sweet tomato aroma and upon removal of the lid you're confronted with six large well-packed headless boneless shiny-skinned sardines covered in a sea of red.  I use water and rinse away all of the tomato-sauce in an effort to reduce the excessive sodium per serving but luckily enough of the sweet tomato essence is left behind to taste.  Another review commented on the firmness of these sardines - they seem perfectly firm to me - they are not mushy and I'm not sure I would want to eat a harder sardine.  Best of all using Amazon prime these sardines ship to my door for .11 cents/oz; my local average grocery stores (Safeway and Giant in Washington, DC) sell the name-brand average quality 4 oz sardine cans at .42+ cents/oz.<br /><br />My favorite preparation: Open can, rinse sardines well with water, darkly toast thick slices of rye or multigrain bread, place sardines on top of toast, cover sardines with any remaining tomato sauce from the can, sprinkle some fresh lemon juice and cayenne pepper over it all and you've got a meal!

review/summary: Not as firm as LA SIRENA...
review/text: Majority of the cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol-A which has been linked to cancer, birth defects, miscarriages, obesity, and insulin resistance, which can lead to Type II diabetes. Refer to the Environmental Working Group report on BPA for more information.<br /><br />I consume many different type of fish. All other brand sardines except LA SIRENA sardines are soft and mushy. La Siena and Crown Prince Sardines in Water, 4.25-Ounce are better. Crown Prince Brisling Sardines are smaller and taste just a bit better without the BPA. 15oz is three times the size of the small cans for much less money and a very good buy when I mix with other food ingredients since there is no way to buy any wild healthy fish like sardines which cost around $2.00 a pound from grocery stores. The junk farm raised fish with added carpet dye is sold for $10.00 a pound which is not healthy at all. I consume more Baltic sprats and herrings from Germany which are very tasty and delicious. Regardless of the type of fish, each can has some 1000~3000 MG of sodium which is not low so I drain the oil since vegetable oil is unhealthy, regardless of the type specified, and never trust when they claim olive oil either, as well as the tomato juice or water, to get ride of the unhealthy part of the can including the unhealthy salt and then consume the fish.
