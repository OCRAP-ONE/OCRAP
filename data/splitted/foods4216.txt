review/summary: My Dog LOVES these
review/text: These are the absolute best things I have bought for my dog! We got them when she was a puppy and it was a savior. I really feel it got her need to chew on things out and not on shoes, table legs, etc.  It is also a good babysitter! When we had our dog as a puppy and at night we would want to sit down and chill out at night but she would be ready to go so we give her one of these and she would sit there for at least 2 hours chewing away.  Merrick is an excellent company with quality products that I am confident using.  I give my dog one of these every couple days, that is how long it takes her to go through one.

review/summary: Great Dog Treat!
review/text: We tried this product from our local pet store and our finicky dog was crazy about them.  They are quite expensive to keep purchasing individually.  We also tried similar looking less expensive products which was a waste of money.  To get a great deal you need to purchase the 50pk box. Great product, great service.

review/text: My Chihuahua's love these and have enjoyed them from puppy stage all the way through adulthood.  Over the last couple years I have purchased several boxes of 50 count because they are defintely my dogs favorite.  They are small enough for the little ones to handle but a good size to last the adults for two to three days...they chew on them continuely when they get one.

review/text: These treats are great tasting and are strong enough to last a couple of days of my chewing!  I have bigger friends that want to share my treat and they can chew much faster.  The beef tendon flossies are not as greasy as other chews.  They do not make an oily spot on fabric if left  there for a while.  Somewhat pricy than other type chews but worth it. Big savings ordering through Amazon.

I do not have to brush their teeth regularly and their teeth are in great shape.  They are a bit pricy and they are going up but they beat the price of a professional cleanings.  Best product on the market that I have found for dogs teeth so far.

review/text: Kimi's not really interested in any type of chew treat/toy. A local store owner suggested these to me when I asked "what will keep my doggie busy for a bit". Kimi goes nuts for these, and what I can't figure out is the same item is available in an uncurled strip - she doesn't like this form. There must be something to the twist that makes it easier to hold??? I definitely recommend this for finicky dogs who need to be occupied for 20 mins or so.<br />Oh also, this item doesn't disrupt her digestive track like some items do (i.e. rawhide).

review/text: I have a little 5 pound Pomeranian and he loves these!! They sell them locally for about 6 dollars, so buying them online in bulk is a great deal!! They also go really fast - I don't know how he does it but he can chew a whole one so that it is gone in about a day or so. Amazing!! When we were watching my friend's Yorkie (they are best friends) they actually broke out in a honest dog fight over one of these!! I was so shocked! My dog seems to prefer them even to bully sticks, but the bully sticks last a lot longer. I would suggest these to anyone!! Your dog will love them, and you for giving them to him!!

review/summary: Merrick Flossies are great, and this is a great price
review/text: I have a Jack Russell Terrier who is 10 years old, 10 inches high, and 10 pounds, rather small for a JRT, but like all JRTs she has a big dog heart in a small dog body.  I have been looking for a while for a good treat that would keep her busy for a while and the Flossies fit the bill.  However the price kept me from treating her very often. (I have seen these for $4.09 a piece!)  Then the vet told me her teeth needed cleaning (actually, they are not that bad at this point). So I gave the Flossies another look.  At this price, a bit more than $2 a piece, I can afford to give her one every other day.  A LOT cheaper than teeth cleaning AND I don't have to worry about her being anesthetized. (Of course, I am also using a couple of natural products to clean her teeth and keep them clean.)  She really goes to town on the Flossies, scraping away on those back teeth, which is exactly what I like to see.  One Flossie lasts about 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the size and shape of the particular Flossie.  A few notes in response to other reviewers -<br /><br />(1) Flossies are a natural product, thus the size and shape varies from one to the next.  All in all, they are remarkably uniform, considering.  So don't expect the perfection of extruded by-product or undigestable fiber.<br />(2) Flossies are a natural product, so they smell when combined with dog saliva.  As long as you expect it, it isn't horrible.  Again, I would rather have that smell than some artificial "spearmint" thing from a plastic toy.<br />(3) ANY TIME your dog is chewing on a Flossie or any other rawhide or fake rawhide toy/treat, YOU should be aware/watching. Any dog will, from time to time, get it in their head that they need to swallow what's left of their treat before they are really finished, usually to protect it from another pet or from you.  Don't leave a dog unsupervised with any edible treat like this or you may end up fishing a curly piece of Flossie out of their throat, especially if you have a dog that tends to swallow things whole or inhale their food.<br />(4) This is the cheapest price I have found and I have looked EVERYWHERE.  (And this is a lot cheaper than teeth cleaning!) If you find a better price for REAL Merrick Flossies, please tell us all!<br /><br />The only way this would be better if it was available on Amazon Prime and I could guarantee I would get it in two days with free shipping.

review/text: Our 10 month old lab could not live without her daily flossie!  If we say flossie she will run straight to the box from anywhere, including outside.  She eats them pretty quickly, so sometimes I put it through an everlasting treat ball (a rubber ball, with slots on both sides that you are supposed to put their biscuits in, but our dog gets them out too fast and could choke on them).  They cost a lot individually at our local pet store, so it is great to be able to buy them in bulk here.  Worth every penny.

review/summary: Best flossie - quality and consistency
review/text: My three Malamute mixes love these Merrick Flossies so much that they have become a night time ritual. Helps with the evening "go out and do your business and hurry back inside" part of the evening because they know that there is a Flossie waiting for them.<br /><br />I love that the quality, size, and dependability of Merrick Flossies can't be beat. They last, don't upset my dogs' digestive systems and are easy for my dogs to manage. One dog licks his, another devours hers and the third carries his around until it gets soggy, then he chews it. Each has a style all his/her own, and the Flossie suits each one perfectly.<br /><br />Buying a large box saves time and money - and I don't run out, which is important since the Flossies are an important part of our bedtime / quiet time ritual.

The only good thing is the local shelter is getting alot of free treats donated from me! :P<br /><br />You can find these cheaper than they are here with free shipping if you search around, but paying over $100 for 50 of these is still quite high for such a short lasting chew.

review/text: My dog loves Flossies and actually perks up her ears when I mention the name. However, I caution everyone not to buy these in bulk because (unless you are feeding them to your dog on a frequent basis - which isn't a good idea anyway) they tend to dry up and start looking unappetizing. Of course you get the biggest discount when you purchase a significant amount, but it isn't worth it in the long run. Also, I have found that some of the flossies in the bulk package are not that appealing (stringy, burnt) and I wouldn't have picked them out if I had been buying them individually.

It either cut his gums or scratched his throat pretty badly. It wasn't in big pieces either. They were pretty small and all soft (chewed). Needless to say I'm still on the search for a nice, safe chew for my dogs.

review/text: The flavor and texture of these candies remind me of the original chocolate Vella-Mint. It has a refreshing taste that tastes of chocolate, mint, and sweetness. The sweetener is sorbitol - not NutraSweet, so that I feel safer eating these.

review/summary: Unexpected combination is FANTASTIC!
review/text: Faerie's Finest Vanilla Sea Salt was a recent birthday gift.  Since I opened it (the version I have came in a refillable grinder) I have been grinding Vanilla Sea Salt on everything.<br /><br />As one is grinding the salt, the smell of vanilla drifts up and is quite soothing and intriguing.  The flavor, once incorporated into food, is very mild.  It is not a "dessert"-y vanilla flavor, due to the sea salt, but when sampled in a bowl of hearty turkish chicken-lemon-egg-rice soup the vanilla smoothed out the lemon flavor a bit- made it almost silky and buttery rather than tart (I put in a little too much lemon this go around)... I had filet mignon and sprinkled a little of the vanilla sea salt on the filet and I think that vanilla sea salt was made for this purpose... Absolute perfection!<br /><br />Fantastic blend, fantastic packaging.  I'm one happy salt fanatic!

review/summary: Handy. And My Boy Loves It.
review/text: My young boy (4-years old) loves chocolate milk. Whenever he requests a  drink I offer him chocolate milk rather than some sweetened beverage. That seems to work well and gives him a variety of needed nutrients rather than a lot of sugar. Down it goes. Every time. The problem has been keeping enough of it around. Then I was in Costco a couple weeks ago and I spotted cases of Kirkland Signature Organic (reduced fat) Chocolate Milk (24-8.25 ounce cartons). That would work fine, and it doesn't need to be stored in the fridge, except for a few carton for immediate drinking. He loves it. Great idea!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: The flavor is great. The only problem is that they seem to break too easy, but only in the box. They are hard to chew and go better if you can dunk them in coffee or milk. I received my shipment and a lot were broken. The pieces were still big enough to eat though. I think it is the nature of the biscuit to break easily and not necessarily Amazon's shipping. Although, maybe the manufacturer could pack the individual biscuits better.

review/summary: Unfit for human consumption.
review/text: The unpleasant smell and greasy appearance were apparent as soon as the can was opened. The caution to not overcook was too late; it already bordered on mush. The vegetables had lost their colors and texture. I didn't know an unground garbonza could be mushy, but they were. It was difficult to imagine why a no-meat soup was SO greasy, and even more difficult to understand why veggie-bean soup needed any kind of vinegar, and this stuff was loaded with the Balsamic variety. I managed to eat 3 spoonfuls before tossing the rest. I will never again subject myself to Amy's GROTESQUE SOUP. I give this a one-star rating because the system will not accept a no-star rating.

review/summary: Thumbs down to the excess oil in this greasy soup
review/text: I have been a vegetarian for about 17 years and have really loved every other product by Amy's Kitchen that I tried, so I was horribly surprised when I tasted this soup.  The biggest thing I didn't like was how greasy it is; it has way too much oil for someone who is used to a low-fat diet.  Also, the amount of onion in the vegetable broth seems like an over-compensation for the lack of meat stock; it's overpowering.  To make matters worse, the other ingredients came off as soggy (and I did not overcook).  However, if you like oily broth and a lot of onion, you might like this soup.  But I will not be purchasing it again; fortunately for me I only bought a single can at the health-food store rather than buying in bulk online.

review/text: I think the flavor of this soup is good, the smell is good, it's very CHUNKY and hearty.  I love that there is a variety in beans, and the onion flavor is good.  But the aftertaste is weird, musty and bland.  I felt like it somehow needed salt, although, being pregnant, salting canned soup is just asking for it.  I don't know how something with so many chunks could be so bland.  It's actually deceiving, when you first take a bite, the taste is flavorful, but then you realize how bland it is.  It made me really sad.  It's certainly edible, but it's extremely disappointing, considering I've made multiple beans soups like this at home that were way better.

review/text: When I opened the can, the reddish-orange oil slick underneath the lid made me suspect that this wasn't going to be a good experience. I decided to give it a chance anyway and ended up regretting my decision. The soup wasn't too bad when I was eating it, aside from the mushy texture, but it left a terrible aftertaste that's still lingering five hours later, and I feel sick from all the grease. I've had other Amy's soups that were good (split pea, chunky vegetable), but you couldn't pay me to eat this one again. Yuck!

Bottom Line: This is without a doubt in the top 5 things out of a can i have ever eaten, but you MUST doctor it up.<br /><br />Maybe 12 cans is a commitment for new tasters and you should sample it first. I found mine locally on sale for a couple bucks each. I am going back tomorrow to buy a whole case.

review/summary: The Best Flavor from any Grape Drink Mix!!!
review/text: If you are reading this, then you are wondering about the taste... there are many types of sugar-free drink mixes, and this is by far the best. Avoid the store-brand, which tend to be flavorless, and also the Crystal Light brand (a bit better, but also bland). This Ocean Spray has the best flavor of any of those. It tastes sweet but is not very tart. The grape flavor is aromatic. This typically is more expensive than the alternatives, but once you've tasted it, you won't be going back to the others.

review/summary: Tastes like Welch's Grape juice and dissolves instantly!
review/text: I've switched from carbonated diet sodas to powdered drink mixes in an effort to increase my water intake. As a result, I've tried over a dozen flavors and brands, including Crystal Light. This one is the best so far. The flavor is rich with absolutely no articial sweetener taste. Especially important to me is that it dissolves instantly, whereas some brands leave a powdery residue inside my glass. These are small packets, with 2 servings each, but they are packed with flavor. I use 1/2 packet with 16 oz ice water and am perfectly content but a full packet works best if your glass is much larger. I keep them in my desk at work and have turned several people in my office on to them. If calorie-counting, one packet = 10 calories.

review/summary: Buyer beware, Proctor & Gamble has ruined this food!
review/text: My girlfriend and I have been rescuing, fostering, and adopting out (through a rescue group) cats and kittens for over 10 years. We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy. So we're very experienced in all aspects of cat care, and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods. The foods are more expensive, but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions!<br /><br />We had been using Innova Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food for several years, once we discovered that it included no by-products, corn filler, or other junk ingredients. Our cats loved the food, which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety.<br /><br />Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months. We heard that Proctor & Gamble, manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods, had purchased Natura Pet Products, maker of the Innova, Healthwise, and California Natural brands, among others. Proctor & Gamble has questionable pet food testing practices (search the internet for it), so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way. So we were very upset about P&G's purchase of Natura, but we stuck with the Innova Cat & Kitten food for the short run, hoping we could later find a better alternative.<br /><br />Well strangely enough, for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat & Kitten that we've purchased, something has changed. The food is much more "crumbly", i.e. there is a lot more "food dust" in the bags, and the kibble looks a little different (lighter colored). We didn't think much of this change until our cats, which had previously LOVED the Innova food, lost interest in it and really didn't want to eat it. In the dry food mix we make, we noticed that very often, the cats would eat the other part of the mix, and leave the Innova Cat & Kitten behind. Clearly there is something different about the way P&G manufactures this food, as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products.<br /><br />This is EXPENSIVE food, and for the money you pay, it should be TOP QUALITY. Well, it ISN'T anymore! We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls (which are usually totally empty after feeding time), and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover, unwanted.<br /><br />So that was it; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat & Kitten to the store we'd purchased them from, and will never buy this food again. In fact, we've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products, which include Healthwise and California Natural. We did find a good quality alternative cat food called "Simply Nourish", and when we tried it with our cats, they LOVED it. There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls, and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality.<br /><br />WARNING: For anyone currently purchasing "Innova Cat & Kitten", or planning to buy it in the future, we believe that P&G appears to have changed the way this food is made, for the worse. We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money, and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market. AVOID this food, it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it did before P&G bought Natura Pet Products, and ruined it!

review/summary: Food is crumbly and Natura unresponsive
review/text: I am in cat rescue and have 20 plus cats in my care at any given time.  I have been buying Innova dry cat food for my cats for about 5 years now.  The cats love it and it has always seemed a good healthy choice for me to buy.  Recently, the food quality has taken a nose dive.  Last month, two out of the eight 15 lb. bags I buy monthly were so crumbly that half of the bag was nothing but powder.  I returned those bags to the merchant and waited a week for them to receive a fresh supply with a different lot number and expiration date and those 2 bags were also crumbly.  I have left messages for the manufacturer - Natura Pet -  to call me with no reply.  At this point, I am searching for a replacement food for my cats and you can bet it will not be manufactured by Natura Pet due to their unresponsiveness to the problems with their product.

review/summary: A great way to get your cookie fix.
review/text: A review for cookies?  Why not?<br /><br />My wife and I love Oreos.  Every once in a while she picks up a bag at the store and we eat some with milk.<br /><br />The problem is that we feel compelled to finish off the bag before they get stale.  Since all the kids are gone that's tough.  It's not really good for us and after 3 or 4 nights it gets kind of old.<br /><br />Recently she got a 12 pack assortment of cookies which contained Oreos, Nutter Butters, etc.  I wondered if there was a way to just buy a whole bunch of "snack packs" for Oreos and sure enough Amazon has them.<br /><br />Now we can have that 6 cookie "fix" without having to remember to pick them up at the store or worry about them going stale if we don't finish them off.

review/text: Three important details about me:<br />1. I have a ridiculously fast metabolism so I always want snacks.<br />2. I'm a student often stuck in long, boring lectures or labs.<br />3. I'm cheap.<br /><br />That's why I was so elated when I found this deal.  I already love Oreos and I'm always searching for small snacks I can shove in my backpack when I'm running out the door.  I tend to buy boxes of snacks and just cycle through them: peanut butter crackers, Nutty bars, bags of M&Ms, Moon Pies, etc.  The 48 pack of Oreos was my most recent one and definitely one of my favorites.<br /><br />They're packaged pretty lightly in little bags of 6 Oreos and I find it to be the perfect amount so that I'm satiated but not wasting any due to losing taste.  One pack of 48 will last me at least a month (sometimes I eat two or three packs in a sitting, okay?) so Subscribe & Save seemed to be my perfect snack solution.<br /><br />Of course I didn't realize how much Subscribe & Save sucks.  The price on these literally doubled after my first month and I had to cancel my subscription.  That said, the product is great but don't trust subscribing through Amazon.

review/text: I have had an Oreo addiction since just about the time I knew what a cookie was.  Its funny how Oreos have managed to hang on and become such a family favorite despite all the competition of much fancier cookies that are available.  No nugets going on here, chocolate bits, caramel, icing, or peanuts either.  Just a tasty chocolate cookie shell with a delicious vanilla filling.  Keeping it simple has been the best policy for Oreo lovers for decades now. These little packages contain Oreos that are a smidgen' smaller than the regular box or bag sized variety.  What the cookie and candy industry refers to as the fun size.  That might explain some of the negative comments as to these Oreos being rather cheap with the filling.  In my opinion the ratio is the same, they are just smaller.<br /><br />This 12 pack is an excellent buy on Amazon.  Buy two of them and you get free shipping and for the majority of us, no sales tax.  A fine buy if you have a lots of Oreo fiends in your home that prefer a measured amount of these great cookies.  Like a lot of other reviewers here I tend to eat less of them when they come in the little packages as such.  Great classic Oreo cookies at a good price.  Highly recommended...

review/summary: great for keeping family fingers out of the cookie jar
review/text: I love these 6 packs. I have three kids and I can easily make a snack bag for school with 2 each. And the benefit is there is not a bag left behind for mom and dad to graze on from the cookie jar. Great packagign for hiding in spots around house so the snack hungry teens do not eat them all in a day.

review/summary: Excellent sandwich cookie
review/text: Ok, for some of you (NAMELY Mr. A. H. of Detroit, Michigan), anything but a chocolate sandwich cookie, embossed with Nabisco symbols and filled with white creme is a travesty, but Golden Oreos are a worthy addition to the cookie line of Nabisco. These are vanilla cookies, slightly flavored with burnt sugar, filled with the familiar white creme.<br /><br />Unlike classic Oreos, the Golden version have not suffered much from having trans-fats removed. The cookie is still crisp enough and the flavor is the same. By contrast, original Oreos seem a bit softer due to the change in recipe.<br /><br />Another good feature is the fact that Golden Oreos don't leave a dark mess on your teeth. So you can eat one and not check yourself in a hand mirror afterwards if you are being in public. This is a very nice cookie with a cup of tea or coffee and a standard in our house for teatime or dessert.

review/text: Each pack contains 6 Oreos.  That's a tidy size for someone who wants a little snack but tends to overdo it with a big bag of Oreos!  However, having 48 of these in the house has led all of us to a bit of Oreo gluttony.  You know how easy it is..."Oh, there's only 6, I'll have another pack."  As a result our box of 48 has barely lasted a month for three people.  So, I will probably not get this anymore because it's too tempting!

review/summary: Chocolate Cream Oreo Cookies 101
review/text: This is less of a review of the actual cookies; though I rated them 5 stars.  The real merit of this "review" is to provide  information that may help others avoid the confusion that I experienced when I received my order.<br /><br />I stumbled upon the product page on Amazon for "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream."  The Amazon product image clearly said "Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream" and I had never seen that product description or package previously.  I had seen regular Chocolate Cream Oreos before and even original Double Stuf Oreos (with the white filling) in local grocery stores but never the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream.  I put my concern about the potential need to buy new pants aside and I ordered a case of 12 boxes, which is the minimum order.<br /><br />I received the case promptly from Amazon.  When I opened it, I found 12 boxes that simply said, "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  I uploaded a picture of what I received.  I called Amazon and told some nice representative in India that I received the familiar regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos that I have seen in stores and not the Double Stuf Chocolate Cream I had been expecting.  He apologized and shipped another case.<br /><br />I received another case today and it was the exact same product that I received a few days previously: "Chocolate Cream Oreo".  Instead of calling Amazon, I decided to call Nabisco (Kraft Foods, Inc.) for clarification.  The number is listed on the package 1800-622-4726.<br /><br />The following is probably the real virtue of this review.  I was told that the package now for the Double Stuf Oreo Chocolate Cream does not say "Double Stuf" anywhere.  As I mentioned, I uploaded an image of the Double Stuf product package that I received.  According to Kraft, the only way to tell is the UPC and package weight.  The package weight for Double Stuf Oreos is 1 pound 1 ounce.  The package weight for regular or normal stuf Oreos is apparently 15.6 oz.  The UPC for Double Stuf Oreos is 04472700.  The UPC for (regular stuf) Chocolate Cream Oreos is 044000025298.  Since the package does not say Double Stuf anymore, I am not even sure what my local grocery carries.  I need to check the package weight and UPC at the grocery store.<br /><br />Therefore before you jump, head-long, into buying 12 boxes of this magical Double Stuf Chocolate Cream, you may want to check what your local grocery store carries.  I really do not see the logic in having 2 different products with the same package, but there you go:  that is apparently the case with Double Stuf Chocolate Cream and regular stuf Chocolate Cream Oreos.  I will also mention that it would be interesting to see a side-by-side comparison of Double Stuf and regular Oreo cookies.  My guess is that the difference is not as significant as you might expect since I initially thought my cookies were regular stuf.

review/summary: not good
review/text: I'm the biggest Oreo cookie eater you'll ever find, so when I discovered they make sandwich cookies I was interested however the taste is significantly different from a regular cookie.  The icing is the same, but the cookie part is soft and mushy like a moonpie.  You can't really dip these in milk because they fall apart.  Not recommended for those who grew up with the dippable kind of Oreo cookies (that being most of us).

review/text: These are always going to be more expensive than buying the single big pack - remember when oreos were packed into three plastic tubes in a plastic box.<br /><br />These oreos always come out crunchy with a very pliable filling that can be easily nudged-rolled off if you don't like the filling.  If Nabisco sold individually wrapped cookies, I'd pay the extra money as I usually only want one cookie.<br /><br />I will always choose to buy oreos packaged in as small a serving as possible despite the expense unless I get some kind of vacuum sealer.

review/text: Great item at $16 (on sale).  My problem with supermarket packaging is the problem that the cookies taste great but once you open the package for about a week the cookies gets moist and taste not nearly as delicious as when the bag was open.  So these small packages, I think 6 cookies each is the perfect size.  They will all taste great and crisp.

review/text: My review is for the product cookie itself, not what might happen if you buy food from Amazon. Oreo is a classic cookie, and while I can't say that I am a big fan of all their flavors, I really enjoy three flavors - original, Uh-Oh Oreos, and the top of the list, Mint Oreos. The flavor is strongly reminiscent of the Thin Mint cookies sold by the Girls Scouts. Unfortunately, they only sell their cookies once in a while, but I can head to my store any time I have a craving for the flavor of chocolate and mint in a cookie. I even like this better than original Oreo, and that's saying a lot. Nom nom.

review/summary: Chocolate covered Oreo recipe
review/text: Everyone loves Oreos. They're even better dipped in chocolate. I made a plate of them for my son's Cub Scout cookie auction and a plate of my cookies sold for $20. So yummy.<br /><br />RECIPE<br /><br />2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips<br />2 tablespoons shortening<br />1 package Oreos<br />*optional: 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening<br /><br />**Before you begin, make sure everything is absolutely dry. Even a drop of water will ruin your creation.**<br /><br />Melt the chocolate chips with the shortening in the microwave for 1 minute. Stir until melted. If needed, heat another 10 seconds at a time until melted. Be careful not to burn the chocolate.<br /><br />Place one cookie in the chocolate and coat. Use a fork to scoop it out, tapping against the bowl and scraping the bottom of the fork on the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place on wax paper and let it set. Store refrigerated.<br /><br />Optional: To make it pretty, melt a cup of white chocolate with a tablespoon of shortening at 70% in the microwave for 1 minute. Dip a fork in the white chocolate and let it drizzle from the fork onto the semi-sweet chocolate covered cookies. If done neatly, your cookies will look beautiful.<br /><br />Hint: I do one batch in semi-sweet chocolate and one batch in white chocolate. Then, I drizzle the cookies with the alternate chocolate. Plate them together for an eye catching presentation.

Oh, how many times have I enjoyed an Oreo milkshake on a hot day, only to smile widely at everyone with a mess of chocolate cookie in my teeth?  *shudders*<br /><br />So, only downside to the Golden Oreos is that I don't think they'd be as good in a milkshake as regular Oreos.  But the pluses are many with the Golden Oreos... a crisp vanilla cookie that is very good all on its own, but sweet biscuits and gravy, the vanilla cookies are paired with a sweet filling.  They are addictive.<br /><br />If you like vanilla sandwich cookies, try the Golden Oreos!

The best way to eat those was to soak them until they were soft in ice cold milk (only could get whole milk back then).  Now there are how many things with the oreo name? TOO many.<br /><br />But this! The Golden Oreo.  Truly wonderful.  Totally different than the original oreo.  But wonderful. It is also BETTER than the current chocolate Oreo.  I wish I could taste-test the original oreo for comparison, but cannot be done...

I'll be watching for the whole bean since I'm sure it will heighten the flavor. Actually bought some interest in the company (JAMN) since i think Mr. Marley has a winning product.
