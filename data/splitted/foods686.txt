review/summary: Wonderful honey!  ' please give this a try
review/text: This is wonderful honey.  Four pounds of Ambrosia honey arrived today  in square 16-ounce plastic bottles with tight seals.  ...no leaks of any kind.  Which is good because the honey arrived in the same box as our order for ocean fish canned catfood.  But  due to  excellent  packaging, all the flavors are wonderful, distinct and separate. (Our cats approved the catfood, we really welcomed the Ambrosia honey.)<br />Seriously, this honey is a natural and life-sustaining product, credit where credit is due. I tried some right after it arrived today; I had no joint pain after eating this honey, which means to me it is natural and doesn't contain  corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup, a chemical additive to some other brands of honey these days, they tell me.  I am grateful for no joint pain, no corn.  Pure honey.<br /> Other reviews  have told you about gentle handling of the product, and that any crystallizing (solidifying) is normal and reversible in a bath of warm water.<br /> So let me concentrate on what a terrific,  necessary product this honey is in your kitchen cupboard  and your emergency supplies.  Honey, peanut butter, and dry milk (or protein powder like MLO)  mixed together make a terrific emergency food.<br />Proportions are as follows:1/4 cup honey<br />  1/3 cup peanut butter<br />  1/2 cup dry milk or protein powder ,\\<br />Mix together into stiff dough that you can separate into bars or into 1-inch balls. (Many variations of this on recipe websites, if you want to look for them)<br /> Keeps in fridge, but during a power outage this mix will be so popular and useful, it won't need to be stored, just more of it made.<br />This is an old Adelle Davis nutritional recipe, credit where credit is due, and in addition this homemade food resembles to a degree a French-manufactured product called Plumpy'nut successfully used by UNICEF to help severely malnourished children.  (more about this on the Web, if you want to know more.)<br />Finally, for your emergency kit, a small amount of honey will help close a scrape or wound, and start it healing.  So many uses for this helpful product from the honeybees.  You can't lose but will win many times over with this Ambrosia natural honey.

review/summary: I just died and went to Heaven (grin).
review/text: My DSL died in mid-post so forgive me if this is a duplicate review.<br /><br />First, I'd like to say that in the past I've been very critical of Amazon's packing jobs.  But this time, the product was packaged expertly.  Thank you.<br /><br />A few years ago, I used to get fresh honey from a farmer/beekeeper close to a large metro area.  Like this honey, his honey was pure and unfiltered raw honey - and it tasted great.  So, to beat the taste of his honey, this honey had a high bar to overcome.  And, it did.  When I opened up one of the bottles, I squirted a bit on my tongue for a taste test.  And when I tasted it, I thought I'd just died and gone to Heaven.  This honey wasn't just great, it was incredibly superb.  I guess the difference between the farmer's honey and this honey must be the Colorado wildflowers.  And, they did make all the difference.<br /><br />This will be a "must buy" item in the future and I might even do it by "subscription."  Besides using it in my coffee instead of aspartame (yuck) or sugar, I'm going to keep one bottle on my office desk.  And whenever I get a bad-tasting mouth, I'll just squirt my problem away (grin).

I had been looking for a healthy alternative to cane sugar and artificial sweeteners for my tea, so I purchased a 16 oz jar of honey from the grocery store for $15.  This Ambrosia honey makes the grocery store brand look like garbage.  It has a very sweet taste to it, almost like apple pie filling, whereas the grocery store brand was somewhat tangy/sour.  This costs 1/4 of the price too...<br /><br />Will definitely buy again when I run out.

review/text: Good luck finding a lower price on natural honey! I've bought this 4-pack several times with Amazon's subscribe & save deal. I use honey in my tea and recipes, and I make mead with it. This one has a vaguely spicy, but still delicate flavor. The only thing I can think to compare it to is cinnamon but it's much more subtle. Very delicious. The bottles are nothing special, kind of thin, and I have to saw the top off to get the honey to come out easily, but don't let that stop you from buying some! I urge anyone to try this honey if you're looking for natural, healthy honey, or if you want to get away from the filtered mass-marketed honey that is often smuggled illegally into the U.S.

It's darker than our store bought counterpart and really has a more complex flavor profile also.

Everyone who has tried has commented that it has a slightly spicy taste as if the bees had used cinnamon nectar to make the honey. I will be ordering this one again. I only gave it four stars because it is not a local honey but where I live that can be hard to find so I guess you make do with what you can.

review/summary: Feelin Hot Hot Hot
review/text: Curry has become one of my favorite foods over the past year.  We've always struggled to make good curry at home as the grocery store curry pastes don't have very much flavor.  I always found myself having to use an entire jar instead of the 1Tbsp that they tell you to use.<br /><br />A friend of ours recommended we try this brand.  It had AWESOME flavor but ended up being a tad too spicy for our taste.  I'm not sure we'll purchase it again.  If we do we now know to not use quite as much.<br /><br />We've really been enjoying the Mae Ploy brand of curry pastes which can be found here on Amazon as well.<br /><br />If you like your green curry at Thai spice levels though, you'll LOVE this!

review/summary: Not virtually indestructible like described...
review/text: My friend has one of these and it keeps her dog occupied for hours which allowed her to study or whatever she needed to do. So I decided to try it. My 2 1/2 year old mini dachshund figured out how to pop the hard treat out in less than 5 min. If this was it, I wouldn't have a problem because she's pretty smart, but it says on the package virtually indestructible and she tore chunks out of the thing you put the treats in. I've never had a problem with her ripping things (other than cheap stuffed animals if she can get them) and she bit chunks off. It's a good idea and works for some, but definitely not hard to destroy as they claim, at least not for her...

review/text: This is the most acidic tomato sauce I've ever used. It's almost as tart as a lemon. I put it in an old family lasagne recipe, but neglected to taste it at first. By then it was too late.  I tried to soften the astringent taste with sugar and sauteed mushrooms, but this was only partially successful. The only thing that saved the dish were copious amounts of Bechamel sauce in the layering. They claim they use only Roma tomatoes, but I'm doubtful. I can't imagine any recipe that would benefit from this sauce.

review/summary: Amazing alternative to the chemical filled pop
review/text: I was introduced to Zevia by a friend.  This is the "cleanest" pop you will find and it is delicious!  The grapefruit is my favorite but all have been really good. Warning to those who have NEVER tasted anything with Stevia in it be prepared for a different taste.  I recommend you use stevia in other foods to get accustomed to the taste before forking out the $$$ for this.  If you haven't had stevia before then you probably won't care to much for it.  In my opinion stevia is an acquired taste...which now I love!  I like the fact that I can give this to my kids with worrying about what the harsh chemicals and sugar are going to do to them!  They both love it too...especially the orange and grape.  Even my husband likes the rootbeer!  I can't wait to get the rainbow pack in this week!!  Yummy!

review/text: I know you're thinking no way, but actually this is really good. It is hard to find this soda on sale in grocery stores, so the price of this case is pretty competitive. The best part about this purchase was getting to try 2 cans of every flavor. Here are my favorites:<br /><br />Cola, Caffeine free Cola, Root Beer, Grape, Dr. Zevia, Mountain Zevia, Cream Soda, Lemon Lime Twist.<br /><br />Flavors I wasnt crazy about:<br /><br />Ginger Ale, Black Cherry, Grapefruit Citrus, Orange.<br /><br />Having a husband to pawn those last four flavors off on is awesome! Stranded on a desert island, I would pick the Root Beer. It even makes a great chaser, although I prefer the Cola for chasers.

review/text: Love the Zevia <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YYFHCS">Zevia All Natural Soda, Rainbow Case, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>products. I don't eat sugar and the sweeteners in all the other diet drinks I've tried (they usually have aspartame) give me a migraine and make me feel horrible. This uses the stevia plant (or rebiana) and erythritol. I've researched erythritol and it seems to be the least harmful of all sugar derived substitutes (it also does not kick me into a sugar craving like some of the other substitutes). Anyway, some of the flavors were a little weird to me at first, like the cola flavor but after the second or third can I started to get a taste for it. I now find them more enjoyable than regular or other diet sodas. Other flavors were great off the bat, like cherry. My favorite is Mtn. Zevia but I read some other reviews that thought it was horrible. FYI Truvia <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P0VEMS">Truvia Nature"s Calorie-Free Natural Sweetener - 40 Packets</a>sweetener is also made of stevia and erythritol and I find it great for sweetening and cooking, though it took some practice. Zero cal. SOBE <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FXIUWY">Sobe Lifewater Variety Pack - 12/20oz Bottles</a>also a great drink and sweetened with erythritol. Many grocery stores carry the SOBE Lifewater for $1.00 per bottle.

review/text: I had a ginger ale from a health food store and was hooked! I have been trying to get away from diet coke, a battle that has been going on for years. I use stevia in the raw in pretty much everything now and was really excited to find a line of sodas that used it. I, or course, was carried away and ordered a case on auto delivery. Mistake. The sodas really are all SOOO sweet, it's nauseating. The makers need to lighten up on the stevia. I still enjoy the ginger ale but am forcing myself to try and get through the remaining case. I can take 2-3 sips of the others before I am turned off. So just get the ginger ale or skip in general. Blah. too bad:(

review/summary: Help. I am officially addicted.
review/text: Honestly, I hate drinking regular cola because of the excessively sweet sugar taste lingering in my mouth, and the diet or zero versions aren't much better because the sweet-n-low taste is just as bad as sugar. So I tried what supposedly is the only carbonated drink that is truly natural.<br />Taste-wise, it is NOT an alternative to other popular cola brands.<br />Zevia comes in variety of flavors that are suppose to imitate the regular drinks (Mountain Zevia, Dr.Zevia, ... really??), but they are not even close to how the originals taste.<br />However, different as they may be, I LOVE the taste of these Zevia soda, much more than other 'original' soda. They taste much more... crisp and natural, without having the lingering sugar/sweet-n-low taste. The natural ingredients, mainly stevia, really has a unique taste that is completely different than sugar.<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy alternative that taste pretty much the same as regular soda, you WILL be disappointed.<br /><br />However, as an entirely separate drink with a completely unique taste, it is, by far, my favorite soda, and I am completely addicted.

review/summary: Good for what it is
review/text: In an effort to cut down on my refined sugar intake, I use Stevia as my main sweetener so was glad to stumble across Zevia.  However, you need to keep your expectations in check.  Think of them as a bunch of new unnamed sodas without the sugar.  So enjoy the discovery of the new soda flavors.  For example, I was a huge Dr. Pepper fan and there is no way that I would mistake Dr. Zevia for Dr. Pepper.  And if you were to ask me if the Cola tastes more like Coke or Pepsi, I would have to say "none of the above".  For root beer fans, the Zevia root beer comes very close.  I do enjoy the Zevia flavors and Dr. Zevia is one of my favorites, but it just doesn't taste at all like Dr. Pepper.  The rainbow case is a wonderful idea as it lets you try all the different flavors.  Until they come out with a Stevia sweetened Dr. Pepper, I will enjoy the different flavors of Zevia.

review/summary: not all Zevia created equal.....
review/text: I love the rootbeer, cr soda, blk cherry and Dr zevia.  The taste of stevia is distinct and to most who have not given up sugar yet, this will probably not be the savior that you may be expecting, but to those of us who have, it's delicious. Mix it with unsweetened iced teas, or juices and it stretches the cost of the soda.  I have not tried the new flavors yet but am looking forward to trying the strawberry.<br />It's worth getting used to it since sugar and Donald Rumsfeld's Defense Department's laboratory byproduct (mistake), Asperatame, is a soft kill and highly addictive.  It took me a year of abstinence to lose my craving for diet coke (drank one large McDonald's size a day), it only took me a week of abstinence to lose my craving for sugar.  Crazy stuff.

So far I've had the orange and the cola...not enjoyable at all.  I had realistic expectations and did not expect it to taste like the "regular" sugar or even "diet" versions that are popular.  But, I had hoped they would at least be good.  My teens and I dislike the taste completely.  There is also a very bitter aftertaste that lingers for a long time.  Ugh.  I'm going to stick to my carbonated water with a slice of lemon from now on. **Have tried all the flavors and still do not like this product.  I have had other products with Stevia that are acceptable, the aftertaste on this one is horrible.

review/summary: Stevia may be the ideal diet sweetener
review/text: If you are drinking diet soda for the taste, please read what other reviewers have written re: the taste of Zevia.  Stevia lends a unique taste that may take some getting used to.  It is "different" than standard diet drink taste.  That being said, if you are drinking diet soda to watch your waistline, you need to step over to Stevia as a sweetener NOW.  Journal papers in Behavioral Neuroscience and the Journal of Animal Science have established the so-called "sweetness response" in which insulin is released in response to sweet taste, rather than as a direct response to sugar-based content.  Insulin without something to metabolize is very efficient way of creating fat.  This is why drinking diet drinks does not help you loose weight.  In fact, if you switch to diet drinks and change nothing else about your diet and exercise regimen, you will GAIN weight.  I have not seen the scientific evidence, but I have  read in at least two non-science books, that Stevia does not cause the insulin release that nutri-sweet and saccharine  do.  This makes Zevia an actual diet drink.  While I agree that soda should be refrained from for reasons other than making one fat (it is bad for the teeth, irritates GERD, among other ill effects), it is unfortunately, the one habit I simply cannot break myself of.  While Zevia is not a health food, at least won't make me gain weight.

I use stevia in the raw at home daily and I have enjoyed the lack of calorie sweetness that it gives me, which lead me to try these sodas.<br /><br />To wrap it up, they have a very strong diet drink taste which is what I was trying to avoid to begin with. If you don't like artificial sweeteners as a concept but don't mind the taste, these drinks may be a more natural alternative for you. Dont expect any of the flavors to taste like anything but a diet soda.

review/summary: Most flavors good; maintains ketosis
review/text: I purchased these for their "0 effective carb" rating, but was surprised to see that they actually have 7 carbs of erythritol per can. However, the can claims that the carbs don't impact blood sugar, and I believe that must be true, because though I am new to low-carb dieting, these did not move me out of ketosis, even though I had approximately 20g carbs from other sources for a given day.<br /><br />I liked most of the flavors in this variety pack, but will probably just focus on one or two in the future, since they weren't all hits for us. Also, it felt weird drinking a clear grape soda, but I appreciate that they don't use artifical colors. Over all, I would buy this product again, just probably not the variety pack, but it is good if you want an experiment in flavor options.<br /><br />On a final note, the "Mountain Zevia" and grapefruit flavors are not returnable at our local (Oregon) automatic recycling center, because their bar codes are difficult for the scanner to read, but this is just a minor issue in general.

review/text: I believe many people who choose Stevia as their sweetener of choice are health-conscious and, as such, would prefer to avoid Aluminum cans (re: Alzheimer's risk) and plastic bottles (re: cancer risk from BPA and phthalates) so glass is the only viable packaging material for this discerning audience.  Otherwise  I enjoy the taste and appreciate the all natural ingredients (especially that no artificial colors are added). I have tried Grape, Cola, and Orange.  For now I will experiment making my own soda on-demand with club soda and organic flavor extracts with either Stevia or Dextrose sweetener.

I thought it might be a nice treat to occasionally have one. They are very good and my husband seems to like them too. I don't notice any weird aftertaste as some other have reported, and they also arrived quickly and in tact. They are a little pricey, but I would definitely be willing to order again as an occasional treat or to keep some soda in the house when visitors come over. The variety pack also gave us a good opportunity to try them out and figure out which ones were our favorites.

review/text: As other folks describe, this soda has a different taste due to the stevia and erythritol sweeteners. It's not bitter or bad like other diet sodas, but it definitely tastes different than sugar sodas. However, when I crave a sweet soda, this fills the need without all the sugar and without the side effects of other artificial sweeteners. I bought the variety pack figuring that I'd prefer one or two of the flavors and so I'd buy only those next time. However, I like all the flavors equally.

review/summary: Very healthy
review/text: I hate to say it, but do not expect Zevia to taste the same as regular "soda". It has a distinct flavor all it's own. So far I like the Dr.Zevia as it is not as strong and tart as the ginger soda. My local supplier only carries 3 flavors. The rasberry is also very tart. So this is the only recommendation I can make, but not having artificial flavors, caffeine , carmel coloring, high fructose corn syrup is worth getting use to in my opinion. Thanks Amazon, face book and Zevia for teaming up!

review/summary: Apparently Stevia does not belong in sodas
review/text: Greatly appreciate Amazon carrying this product, as it affords customers the opportunity to evaluate this product.<br /><br />The case arrived without the Dr. Zevia (Dr. Pepper cans).  Ginger root beer had been substituted and doubled.  Unfortunately, I bought this specifically to try the cola, ginger ale, and Dr. pepper equivalents.<br /><br />The grape and orange are the better products, although they have no coloring.<br /><br />Unfortunately, almost all of the soda's have an aftertaste...reminiscent of saccharin in some peoples opinion.<br /><br />Some found the taste to be cloying.  No one found any taste to be fresh, crisp, or refreshing.<br /><br />I had such high hopes for Stevia in soda.<br /><br />Even Canada dry diet ginger ale has more ginger taste than Zevia ginger ale.  Zevia cola did not remind me of any similar cola I have ever had.  In fact, a blind test would have revealed a mildly sweet beverage with no outstanding taste markers and of benign flavor.

review/summary: Some Taste Great Some Taste Like .....BEEP
review/text: I will break it down for you.<br /><br />The fruit flavors are awesome and so is Root Beer and Cream Soda. I REALLY LOVE THE CREAM SODA AND CHERRY.<br /><br />The cola flavor is the worst tasting drink I have ever tasted.  The Dr Pepper wanna be is nothing like it at least Mr Pibb ot it right. The mountain dew is like something front the bottom of a swamp.  I just want to ask the makers of these drinks, " Have you ever had Coke or Pepsi, mountain dew or dr. Pepper? I'm guessing if you have then your taste buds don't work because you haven't even come close.<br /><br />Keep upthe grwat work on the cream soda and the awesome fruit flavors.  Go back and try the soda flavors again.

review/summary: different but better
review/text: I'm amazed at some of the bad reviews here, but can only assume that some of them, at least, come from people who expected Zevia's colas to taste just like their more famous counterparts.  Well, they don't taste exactly the same... The ingredients are totally different, so of course they will taste different.  However, I LOVE the taste of Zevia.  It tastes clean and crisp, and makes brand-name sodas taste especially gross to me now.  I am a former addict of Diet Mt. Dew and was so happy to find a healthier product to replace it.  Was the first glass of Mt. Zevia exactly what I expected?  No.  But by the second glass, I was hooked.  I haven't looked back!  I've liked every flavor I've tried, and am on the hunt for the new Strawberry flavor to buy locally.

review/summary: Delicious but not the flavor you're used to.
review/text: When I first started drinking this soda, I was really surprised. None of the flavors that come in the rainbow case accurately recreate their non-stevia counterpart. In general, this could be because  of the stevia, or it could be due to a flavoring. However, they don't taste bad! In fact, they're quite tasty, and in a lot of cases, I actually prefer the taste of this version over others. For example, while the "Dr. Zevia" tasted nothing like Dr Pepper, I loved it! Out of all of the flavors, I would say that the ginger root beer and the grapefruit are my favorites. I've gone through at least 10 cases at this point, and I doubt I will stop any time soon.

review/text: I have been drinking Zevia for about two years.  They have a ton of flavors now compared to when they first started out.  Their 'Cola' and 'Root Beer' equivalents are my favorite.  I'm NOT a fan of their 'Dr. Pepper' equivalent.  I have tried most of their flavors and enjoyed their 'Mountain Dew', 'Grape', 'Orange', and 'Cream Soda' equivalents, but again, really really enjoying their 'Cola' and 'Root Beer' flavors the best.<br /><br />If you want to try a healthier less sugary version of your Coke Cola, give this a shot and I think you wont be disappointed.  I just added their "rainbow pack" to my subscribe and save for the family.  I have one coming every 2 months.  They like them as well :)<br /><br />It's really a guilt free soda and you don't have to worry about all the crazy chemicals that come with the name brand diet soda's.<br /><br />As a side note, I had to deal with their customer service once and was happy with how they handled me question.  It was in regards to one of their "natural flavor" ingredients.<br /><br />At the very least, give them a shot, you might end up being glad you did.

review/text: I received this product last week and my husband and I have been slowly trying the drinks. Thus far, the horrible outweigh the okay. The Grape was okay...the Dr. Zevia was okay...and that's been about the only okay products. The Mt.Zevia was like a flat Mt. Dew, the Cola was nothing like cola, the Ginger root beer was like a carbonated chai drink. They have been such a let down. I am very bummed that this was not a good product as I grew up on diet drinks and am quite attached to them. Not these. Never again, nor would I recommend them.

review/text: I do a lot of shopping on Amazon and this is the first bad product that I have received. I usually don't bash products but, these are terrible. The root beer and dr pepper clone do smell good at first but, it goes down hill from there. The mountain dew clone was the worst, I about gagged. All have the same nasty bitter taste and terrible odor with the individual flavor added on top. All 24 cans down the drain or should I say 27 bucks down the drain. It kind of reminds me of red bull or a preworkout/no2 drink. Fine if you have to drink it but, not if you want a drink to enjoy. I use stevia daily in my ice tea and coffee and it is great so, I don't think it's the stevia.

And the price is so much better than buying the limited flavor six packs at Whole Foods.<br /><br />Hooray for Amazon, my favorite place to shop for anything!

review/summary: Don't expect much!
review/text: First I must say until recently I have never found a diet soda that actually tastes good enough to drink regularly. I was very excited to receive the Zevia All Natural Sodas because I have insulin resistance and I'm not supposed to have alot of sugar. I use the Truvia and Stevia sugar and I thought it would be a good idea to try the soda. I ended up giving the sodas away to a coworker and I'm sure my coworker threw them away. The taste is awful. The "coke" soda is way too sweet. The only flavors that I tried to convince myself that I could drink were grape, orange and cream soda and even those are not really good. If you are looking for a good tasting diet soda a coworker brought me a can of Sprite Zero, and it was actually good. It's not far off from the original Sprite. Oh, and my coworker was drinking Rockstar which I guess is another diet soda and he said Rockstar tastes better than the Zevia soda.

review/text: I recently began using an artificial sweetener called ZSweet (ingredients: erythritol and stevia).  THere is absolutely no aftertaste or bitterness to this product, and I nearly can't tell the difference between it and sugar - and it's the only zero calorie sweetener I can stand.<br /><br />I went looking for products that contain erythritol and I was SO excited when I discovered this brand of soda. It would be so nice to be able to drink the occasional soda again. So I ordered this sampler.<br /><br />I've tried 6 of the 12 flavors.  They all have a very distinct, terrible aftertaste.  What a disappointment.

review/text: At first, the soda tastes great, but then the stevia or whatever else they put in it kicks in.  You are left with a very unnatural taste and feeling inside your mouth.  The aftertaste is a deal breaker.  I resolved to slam the last four of the sodas so I only had to deal with one final aftertaste.  The aftertaste/freeling of four sodas lasted for several days, even after drinking other things, eating, brushing, flossing, and waterpik'ing.

review/summary: One star is generous....
review/text: 1.  Box arrived with case wrapped in a plastic bag, containing one can (empty), and a soggy cardboard tray with the other 23 cans. It appears to have blown up either prior to, or at UPS, as the box was a UPS box.<br /><br />2.  Positive- the level of carbonation was very good.<br /><br />3.  The flavors reminded me of rancid cough syrup. NONE of the 12 flavors were worth more than a sip, or the second can. There was a full-on flavor malfunction and also an aftertaste that did not want to go away.  The Dr. Zevia certainly was named well, for the resemblance to medicine.  The root beer smelled like root beer.  The fruit flavors weren't artificially colored, so essentially all looked like lemon-lime (which is actually fine by me).<br /><br />I'm just glad I got the sampler case, and wasn't left with 23  full cans and one with a single sip taken out of it.  The first two cans, I'd poured over ice, and took a good slug, and nearly choked.  After that, it was a tentative sip of the remaining 10 flavors.  I couldn't find ONE that I'd ever want to have again.<br /><br />I REALLY wanted to like this stuff. I'm a diabetic, so diet soda isn't just a preference- it's what I have to have if I'm going to drink soda at all. I budgeted for 2 cases from my next pay check (guess I'll be getting more cases of WATER).  I generally like erythritol and stevia sweetened items- especially erythritol- I use it on cereal.  Tastes just like sugar, and can be used for baking as well as cold items.<br /><br />Total waste of more than $25.  That could have bought my perishable items this week.

review/text: There really isn't much to say about this.  If you like freeze-dried ice cream, you'll probably like this.  Like all freeze-dried ice cream, it seems ridiculously overpriced for what you get, but that's the way it goes.  About a quarter of the tube is filled with smooshed crumbs, but it eats the same.  The tube is small, of course - about 1.5 times the height of a chapstick and maybe twice the diameter.  It has white, brown, and pink balls (white seems to be the largest).  I listed them by color because I can't really say that they taste like vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry because they are so small.  All in all, I think I prefer the small bricks better than these little balls, but I kind of enjoyed flipping the top and pouring some into my mouth.

The flavor is tangy and hints a little Asian flavors, though it is distinctly Italian pepper flavors. I wasn't expecting a specific taste or texture when I bought it so I'm pretty happy with getting something that I haven't experience before. I will find a lot of uses for this.<br /><br />I could see it being an excellent addition to a spicy pasta sauce, or pizza sauce. It may also work well mixed with olive oil and used as a base or spread for breads and pizza and such.<br /><br />Also, it's fairly hot, but not too hot. It's fine for most people who like a little heat, but anyone who likes only very mild spiciness will want to pass on this.

review/text: this powder tea has granulated sugar in it to make it sweet. If your looking for it to be a healthy sweet your out of luck but if not I would say this product is delicious. It's presweetened so you ust put in a scoop and your on your way to drinking traditional green tea.

review/summary: Sugar added
review/text: I apparently did not read the add thoroughly enough.  They have added sugar to this matcha which makes is basically useless for traditional tea ceremony and the sugar is not very healthy.  It tastes ok, so for someone just wanting some matcha ice cream or a dessert, its ok.

review/summary: sweetness!
review/text: This stuff does taste kinda like starbucks. But with all the sugar I did'nt really enjoy it. Buy this if your running low on sugar and don't like green tea.

review/summary: Great stuff--highly potent
review/text: I first learned about maqui berries in a health food magazine, and couldn't wait to try it out. Not only is it jam packed with great vitamins and minerals, but it also has the highest antioxident value of any discovered fruit. The taste is very similar to the Acai berry, but in powder form, the maqui is quite bitter. I recommend mixing it with some other fruit. The way I use this powder is in a morning smoothie---it gives me a full day's worth of fruits and 1 serving of veggies all jam packed into my breakfast...I love this because it's always so hard to fit in fruits and veggies otherwise.<br /><br />My smoothie:<br />2 tsp maqui powder<br />1 tbsp chia seeds (also a super food)<br />1 tbsp wheatgrass powder (another superfood)<br />1/2 cup fresh or frozen fruit (I normally use strawberries, blueberries, or mango)<br />6 or 7 ice cubes<br />1/2 to 3/4 cup water<br /><br />Makes me feel full all morning long. Hope you enjoy this as much as I do!

review/summary: Excellent Product, Excellent Taste
review/text: This tea blend is excellent and tasty. Usually teas with valerian root are hard to drink as they smell/taste bad; not this blend! The Healing Tree blend has great flavor and will put you to zzzzzzzzzz.<br />Finally a good valerian root blend on the market.<br />We also like The Healing Tree Herbal Blend Echinacea Immune, Caffeine Free Loose Leaf Blend Tea, 2.08-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)It works wonders especially during the cold season.

review/summary: Light and crispy
review/text: These are great snacks.  They're similar to the veggie sticks I often get in my local supermarket, but the shape is a bit fatter and hollow in the middle.  this makes them lighter and unfortunately easier for me to eat a lot of them.
