review/text: I ordered these for my son because subscribe & save was A LOT cheaper than going and buying them at the store.  I have seen a lot of reviews where people received their jars broken, I ordered 5 different 12 pack jars of food and not a single one came broken, all of them were wrapped very well in bubble wrap.

review/text: I fed this to my daughter for the first time today.  She is an alright eater and is pretty open to most things but she loved this and I couldn't shovel it in fast enough!  I normally give her baby cereal at breakfast and dinner and love that this one jar already had the oatmeal in it so it makes it much easier to travel with!  My daughter liked it so much I just ordered two cases from Amazon and will be coming back for more!

review/summary: Thicker consistency is much appreciated
review/text: The first prunes are good, but much too runny past 6 months.  The prunes with the oatmeal are much better for older babies who can use their hands to flail around.  These stay on the spoon much better!  It also skips the step of adding cereal grains to the food to make it a different consistency.  Older babies will appreciate the different tastes as well!

review/summary: Must have in every baby food cupboard
review/text: My 3 1/2 month old was eating all the time and reconstituted rice cereal with breast milk just wasn't doing the trick.  After reading what is in this (and what isn't in this), I decided to give it a try.  I LOVE this particular Earth's Best food.  My baby loves it too (I tried a few others too but this one is the winner).  Now she is sleeping more soundly and so am I. At 4 months, she eats 1 jar a day so far.  It is well worth the cost, especially if you get on Amazon's automatic monthly shipping which reduces the overall price. Being post-partum, it gives you less to try to remember too!

review/summary: Good product, misleading description
review/text: The description clearly states "variety pack", but you only get one flavor- banana apricot mixed grain. Hopefully your baby likes it.<br /><br />The good thing is, my baby, who is quite picky, and would only eat "carrots" and "tomato & carrots" out of the whole line up of earth's best flavors at the local grocery store, actually likes this.<br /><br />What I love about the fruit & whole grain combo (or other things & whole grain combo) is that this is the only way I've found to give my baby some grains without it being fortified with lots of stuff.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I make almost all of my baby's food, but we buy some for on-the-go and unexpected outings.  The bar is set very high on taste and quality, as my 9 month old has refused to eat some brands we have tried to feed him.  I also always taste anything I feed to my son, so again, I have high expectations.  This food was a great deal, and we like the Earth's Best brand, so I bought some.  My son loves it, and I think it tastes great.  An easy way for breakfast on-the-go, instead of having to deal with mixing rice or oatmeal cereal and his fruit.  The only warning I have is that I thought I would be getting a banana/grain & apricot/grain variety pack, but it is banana/apricot/grain all in one jar.  The wording was a little confusing & the flavor on the jar pictured was really small.  But it turned out to be a hit!

It is great to have the convenience to order these on-line and have home delivery.  I can't imagine going the store and having to get a whole case and go through check out.

The okra is nice and fresh and crisp, but the<br />"natural flavors and spices" have been overdone. I've made my own okra pickles with only<br />3 ingredients and they are 10 times better than these things. And don't mind the "hot", you<br />wont be able to eat enough of these things to detect any heat. The salt, garlic and other<br />spices just flat overpower.<br /><br />Thanks for the memories Talk O', thats the only reason you got 3 stars.

review/text: I just bought 8 tubs of these on amazon and they are really the greatest candy ever. I would try them out before ordering, while they taste great they are sour and sweet so I would make sure you like them. You can buy a wrapped pack of 9 in a store to try them out, but these, the one's that come 200 in a tub, are fresher and taste better. The taste is pretty strong, I sometimes feel like my face is sweating after eating them (in a good way). I also keep a tub at a time in the fridge because they don't taste good when they are warm. Great product (Strawberry flavor)

The texture is soft, but they don't melt into each other, when you pull them apart, each piece will have their own sour particle in tact. Far better than expected, and it reminds me of a candy I used to get as a kid 15 years ago, I wouldn't be surprised if it was. They liked to charge 5 to 10 cents a straw. Don't hesitate, it's well worth it :O

review/summary: Terrible!!
review/text: This is a horrible blend. No body, bad flavor, just plain weak. I thought I stumbled upon a coffee flavor that I had not been able to find for a long, long time. This is nothing like I remember or had in the past. What's even worse is I had to buy for bags of this mess. Don't do it. Pass on this.

review/summary: Alot of licorice!
review/text: I ordered this because I like to make unusual Christmas "goodies" and I need "skinny" licorice for many of my projects and this fits the bill.  Not only do I get a variety of colors, it tastes great. It sure beats cutting regular licorice into strips.  The only "con" I have is I can't stop eating it while I'm using it!  It freezes well too so that's a plus as I don't have to use it all at one time.

review/summary: The best candy laces!
review/text: Gustaf's rainbow candy laces are the best I've ever found.<br />They have very tasty distinct flavors, and the texture is perfect, not<br />too hard or soft, but just right! And because of their shoelace length they<br />are excellent for edible projects for kids to use for activites such as macrame, braiding or<br />knot tying practice. They can be frozen to keep their freshness and defrost without losing any quality.<br />Also, the price was quite reasonable, and delivery quick. You can't go wrong with Gustaf's rainbow laces!

review/summary: Terrible customer service and shipping!
review/text: The gumballs are fine.  Not a lot you can do to a gumball.  However, the customer service and shipping process for the Candy Depot is totally inept.  First, I received an email that my orders had been cancelled.  No explanation, just cancelled.  When I emailed to inquire what was going on, I got an email back saying that the items were being shipped by a quicker service, so I could receive the gumballs in time for Christmas (to go with the gumball machine that I purchased as a gift).  Great!  Then, two days later, I get an email from Amazon stating that my gumballs had shipped on that day, the 22nd, and not on the 18th, the date the Candy Depot stated they had shipped the item.  So, on Christmas day, there will be a gumball machine, but no gumballs.  Of course, if the Candy Depot had been honest, or at least not totally incompetitent, I could have gone out locally and gotten some.  But, alas, too late.  By the way, when I got the Amazon shipment notification, I again emailed The Candy Depot to ask what was going on, forwarding to them their email stating they had shipped on the 18th and asking what was going on.  Surprise, no response.  I suggest you get your gumballs locally or from someone other than the Candy Depot, unless you don't care when you get them (a week or so).

Got this two pack on sale.<br /><br />First time was fine but the second time was a mistake.  I kept thinking I'd made the coffee wrong.  Then I decided I must need a new coffeemaker - tho' mine is only a few months old.  So I dragged out the old Braun and brewed up a pot.

review/summary: Wonderful, fragrant butter. Best I know for use as a spread.
review/text: A few years back this butter was much more available (I used to buy it in Acme). Then it disappeared... like three-to-five years ago, I'd guess. There's nothing critical I can say about this butter: it's better than any other kind I'm aware of in that it's very flavourful in addition to whatever else. I get it (for four-nintety-nine) at Whole Foods (no shipping of course: quite a savings compared to this page). Also, if you search this site, you'll find reports that it gets shipped unrefrigerated, so there are good chances you'll get a spoiled product. At the store, otoh, it is of course, stored in a refrigerated section and is guaranteed to be good. I love this butter and recommend it very highly; it's the best kind I know (not for cooking of course, it's too expensive, and you lose the flavour). Great stuff, head and shoulders above any typical supermarket stuff, even better than the Irish butter (which is great but not as full-flavoured).

review/summary: Tastes like real lemons if you're a robot...
review/text: ...and have only been programmed with the idea of lemon and have never experienced a real lemon.<br />The texture is nice, smooth and creamy, but sorry to say the flavor is truly fake and NOT good.  No one with any palate at all will be fooled.  Although hey, if you're getting cake, your day is probably better than most people's day.  So, if it tastes like something from a faulty replicator, again, HEY CAKE.<br />Or, if you're hormonal or something, perhaps you didn't even manage the cake part.  Perhaps you're standing in the kitchen scooping it out with your finger.  In that case, you might not care.  The taste of tears might throw you off and make you less likely to notice the fake lemon flavor.<br /><br />I am using this tonight and in an attempt to improve the flavor, I have mixed in the zest of one entire lemon, plus about 2 tsp of lemon juice.  Then I could still taste a lot of ominously artificial chemical compounds, so I also added some orange zest.  I will say tentatively that it seems to be helping, although we'll have to see how it tastes on the actual cake....oh, and there's also a very subtle grainy texture under the first impression of smoothness.<br /><br />You may ask, if I have zest and juice, why doesn't my lazy ass just make frosting.<br />There are many reasons, some of which you might understand since you yourself are reading a canned frosting review with the assumed intention of buying some.  Who are you to judge me?  At least I'm taking the time to share my experience.  And save you making the same mistake.<br />So.  Will this work?  Yes.  You can physically spread it on cake, or fingers.  Does it taste good?  IMO:  Not really.  Maybe some tears will help if the zest and juice don't.<br /><br />Wouldn't buy again.  Next time I'll get some damn butter and do it up right.

review/summary: My family's favorite
review/text: Out of maybe 4 different Hamburger Helpers I buy on a regular basis, Beef Pasta remains my family's favorite and although I subscribed to it every six months, I think I'll have to change this to 3 months, since we've been eating it more lately.<br /><br />I've made this with both ground beef and ground turkey and both turn out great. With a nice, beefy taste to it, this is one of the few dishes my picky daughter will go back to for seconds and thirds. My husband said one night that soon I'd need to make two boxes at once, but I think instead I'll just make side dishes to fill people up.<br /><br />The current subscription price ($7.45 for 6 boxes) makes the price per box come out to $1.24 each box, which is the same as the cheapest sale price I can get at local stores. Usually the sale puts the boxes at $1.50 to $2.50 each, so it's already a bargain with free shipping.

review/summary: Quick supper and great deal!
review/text: This flavor of Hamburger Helper is similar to the Stroganoff flavored one without the sour cream in it.  This is a plain dish that you can add seasonings or spices to, or just serve it with sour cream and a bottle of Louisiana hot sauce (which covers a multitude of cooking sins).  Anyway, this is quick for a family on the run when you want to eat together but need something quick.  Prepare with hamburger or ground turkey, serve with a salad or vegetable and reconnect at home.  With Amazon Prime and/or an autoship scheduled delivery of this, it is the same price or less than any grocery store.  Another plus for families is that these usually have Box Tops for Education on them too.

review/summary: EXCELLENT Quality & Taste; Very, Very Versatile Too
review/text: ~ I ordered Farie's Finest Coconut powder, Maple Flavored Powder, Peppermint Flavored Powder and Powdered Vanilla to send to my daughter in the Czech Republic because some foods like coconut and maple syrup can be hard to find or insanely expensive there.  I tasted this and it was delicious; I was especially pleased at how pure it tasted with absolutely no unpleasant residual flavors or tastes whatsoever.  To try it out I put a heaping tsp. of it into a cake mix to turn a pineapple upside down cake into an even better pina collada cake and it turned out absolutely scrumptious.  My greatest coconut secret is that I add some coconut to the chicken broth and herbs when 'infusion roasting' my turkey (it's an improvement on the beer can chicken method) because coconut really compliments and enhances the turkey flavor.  I love to cook and bake things more uniquely than everyone else does and powders are especially easy to mix into almost any dish; so I'm sure that I'll be thinking up many more creative ways to use this coconut powder.<br />~ In summary, I'm very impressed with the wide variety of products that Farie's Finest offers but I'm even more impressed with the quality and purity of flavor. I'm working on a large order for my own use and I can hardly wait to come up with new recipe idea's using Farie's Finest products.  So I gladly, very confidently and very, very highly recommend this company and their excellent products.

review/summary: Unusual texture - full of flavor!
review/text: Because I love licorice in general, I check out Amazon's selections every once in awhile - and whenever I can get a good bulk price, I try a new type.  This was among my most recent buys.  I loved these Gustaf's Zaanse Drops- I'm not sure if the inconsistent texture is supposed to be there, but of the gum based drops and diamonds, only a few I've had so far have been soft and easy to chew - in fact, each one I try seems to have a different texture, going from soft and chewy like a gum drop, right up to tough and resistant to the chew (not hard or stale). Now please recognize, it's the tough and resistant texture that I love the most - and to me, the inconsistency of the texture is part of this candy's charm.<br /><br />I also loved the unique flavor of this one - it's a bit stronger licorice kick than found in most other licorice candies, especially wimpy American types, and there's even a subtle sense of the salt taste that characterizes Dutch licorices, but not in an offensive way (I've had some Dutch licorice that I did not enjoy because of too much salt - this one is hardly noticeable to me).<br /><br />I'll be ordering this one again - it's a winner.

review/summary: Overpriced but excellent texture and good taste
review/text: I have made macaroni and cheese using this pasta several times and am now hooked.  One thing I must say is that it is IMPERATIVE that the water for the pasta be in a full boil before adding the pasta to the water -- otherwise you end up with a slimy slush.  Other than that, the only other things to worry about are a)overcooking and b)overeating.<br /><br />For leftovers, the pasta dish must be covered and thoroughly reheated until very hot, else the pasta will be leathery.  If you find the reheated pasta is like leather, you just need to cover and microwave a little longer.<br /><br />IMO this pasta tastes *better* than non GF versions -- and it had better, given the price, right?  Even so, I've taken off one star for the price because these are SO much more expensive than the non GF version (which can be purchased for 1/3 the price per unit...as in 99 cents).  However perhaps this might explain the expense -- the box containing the bags of pasta was marked "Product of Italy".

review/summary: A true wheat pasta alternative
review/text: Mrs. Leeper's Corn Elbows are a true alternative to wheat pasta. I cook gluten free for my grandson and for a family friend, but serve this pasta to the whole family. Unlike rice pasta, Mrs. Leeper's stays firm and intact when fully cooked. I recently prepared macaroni and cheese with the corn elbows, and the result was beautiful and delicious. Thanks, Mrs. Leeper!

review/summary: Fantastic Pasta
review/text: I've tried non-gluten products and ended up tossing them out.  Mrs. Leeper's Corn Elbows are fantastic.  In fact, they're better than wheat pasta.  They are light and not sticky.  I agree with some of the other reviewers, don't over-cook them.  I found it only takes from 5 to 6 minutes to have perfect pasta.  We've had them cold, hot and reheated.  I'm thrilled to find them here on Amazon.  Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Simply the Best!
review/text: We first discovered corn pasta when our family went gluten-free over a year ago.  The brand we used was very good, and tasted almost exactly like wheat pasta.  While not certified organic, it was certified GMO-free.  The only thing that took some getting used to was the starchy mess it left in the pan after it was cooked.  I recently tried Mrs. Leepers after we ran out of our usual brand.  To my surprise, the pan was virtually free from mess, and a breeze to clean up.  What's more, it's organic - which is very important to our family.  To top it all off, the taste is significantly better.  I am now signing up for Subscribe and Save on this product.  It's still a bit more expensive than the brand we were using, but it's well worth the extra cost.

review/summary: Nothing else like it!
review/text: We just recently began to carry this at the grocery store that employs me.  All of my coworkers have tried it, and we simply cannot get enough!  Of the four flavors available, two seem to be tied for the store's favorite: blood orange and grapefruit.  Perhaps the orange and the lemon just aren't unique enough.  This one is my favorite; it is crisp, refreshing and not overly sweet.  I like the balance of sweet and bitter.  While not being a germophobe, I still appreciate the foil on top of the can.  It is nice to know that no rodent feces dusted the can's opening while in a warehouse.  ;)

As far as orange sodas go, I don't see how you can do much better.  We definitely didn't notice any kind of weird aftertaste.  Also the price on here (don't forget the shipping) is ridiculous.  See if your local Walmart stocks this, because ours does and it was only about 5 bucks.

review/summary: Cool can, has an aftertaste
review/text: I purchased this locally and should have checked the reviews since the first can made me wonder if I had bought diet.  It had the worst aftertaste of any soda I think I have ever had (regular or diet), even though I could not see any artificial sweeteners in the ingredients.  The list of ingredients is really why I purchased, so the extreme aftertaste is a mystery to me.  I am not sure I can even use them in a mixed drink since it would need to be diluted strongly.<br /><br />I just tried another can and was able to get through it, but several minutes later the aftertaste remains.  Aside from the bitter aftertaste, it would be pretty good.  I know that blood orange has a bit of an aftertaste and the fact that this soda does too may be a testament to it being true to the flavor of blood orange.  However the can states 3% blood orange and 13% orange juice so I would not have expected this much of the blood orange bitterness to come through.  This is just not for me.<br /><br />UPDATED: Added a star since there is no brominated vegetable oil or other weirdness, the ingredients seem pretty good.<br /><br />UPDATED May 27, 2012:  Added another star because I have been going though my 24 pack (bought from a warehouse club) and they are growing on me, but I still don't like the diet like after taste.  They taste not too bad with an Emergen-C mixed in, seems to tone down the bitterness a bit.  Unfortunately 3 stars is the highest I can go on this, I don't think I would buy this flavor again.

review/summary: Doesn't Taste Like Any Blood Orange I've Eaten
review/text: This drink does not deliver in what it promises... It doesn't taste like a blood orange, it isn't tangy enough to balance the sweetness and then it has a sharp bitter aftertaste that lingers on the tongue like an intense grapefruit juice.  If you love grapefruit for its bitterness, then you might like this drink.  For others like myself, it's disappointing that I was expecting something fresh and lively and tangy like Pellegrino usually delivers and here I'm left with an intensely bitter drink.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

review/text: I was excited to try this, as I love blood oranges and the blood orange-flavored syrups and preserves I've tried in the past. I'm also a big fan of the San Pellegrino limonata, and the arianciata is good, also. But this was not a winner. Too much sugar, to begin with - it's not balanced by a corresponding acidity. And the distinctive flavor of blood orange doesn't come through cleanly. I don't know what the "natural flavors" are, or how much the coloring ingredients, like "black carrot," impact the flavor. But we don't know what to do with the remaining 5 cans.

It seemed the prices for US & Italian were about the same.<br />My next ingredient for a recipe in 'Cuisine at Home' is truffle butter for a pasta sauce.  They suggest as an added flavor boost to use truffle oil instead of the recipe's olive oil.  I'm getting hungry!

review/text: I was enticed by the description and other reviews, and I want to be completely fair to this product, but I was very disappointed in it.  The oil is pleasant enough, with a nice clean scent, but the bottle I got lacks any aroma of truffle.  White truffle oil should have a strong earthy aroma so that a few drops in an omelet or a splash on a pasta dish should suffice for a lot of flavor, as has been the case with other kinds I have used.<br />Perhaps this was an issue of quality control.

I try to share it with a friend, but the serving size per bag has prevented me from taking these with me to work as often as I might if a bag had half as much of the pieces.<br /><br />On the other hand, a huge plus is the simple list of natural ingredients and that it works with my gluten free diet.

review/text: My 9 year old male kitty, Domino,who weighs 18 lbs and has a very, very delicate stomach and can't eat a lot of cat products. He can only eat one canned cat food, two different dry cat foods, absolutely NO people food at all and can only eat one other treat but he loves Kitty Kuisine Natural Fish Flakes more than anything he can eat! When I go into our kitchen and somehow he knows when I go there, he runs, sits by his Kitty Kuisine dish and stares at me, meowing very loudly so I will hear him! If I don't give him his Kitty Kuisine, he will run after me and nip at my legs until I go back and give him some of his favorite treat! Although the nips don't hurt, they get my attention and he keeps them up, chasing me into other rooms of the house until I give him his treat! I know he is spoiled but we love him and will always buy him his Kitty Kuisine treats. I buy 18 of the 6 oz containers and when they get down to only two left, I have to order 18 more or suffer marks on the back of my legs! Domino is not a fat cat but very tall, long and solid kitty. Domino really has me trained well! Today it is time for me to order another 18  6z of 6 pack Kitty Kuisine Natural Fish Flakes so I had better order before he starts meowing at me! Have you ever had a kitty who NAG, NAG, NAGS you? Well, I do!
