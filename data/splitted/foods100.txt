review/summary: Wonderful Surprise!
review/text: I need hard sugar free candy to suck for dry mouth caused by medication I am on.  I bought this candy without ever having tried them since I can't buy them locally. What a wonderful surprise to find that they have plenty of delicious flavor, they don't stick to teeth like other hard sugar free candy I have tried, and they don't dissolve instantly. They are very cheap compared to comparable candy in discount stores. This is a winner all the way around.

review/summary: Okey do kee
review/text: Nothing too spectacular with these hard candy. Tried a few but first they must be removed from their individual and sometimes annoying, packaging. Sugar free is a good thing but who really knows what the term really means when they are using sorbitol? I have no time to complicate matters in my eager existence but must confess that I have been sold for a long time to the name Crystal Light. I associate that name with safe for people trying to avoid sugar, even though I have been challenged several times, perhaps by people that are trouble makers at best but obviously more informed on the subject than I will ever be.  Yes, they have their little taste for they are very tiny for all the unwrapping it requires to consume them and who knows which fruit is which, in the end they all seem to taste the same. Not like eating a mint mentos where the moment it goes in your mouth you know exactly what you are getting. Still, they serves its purpose, for the person that I bought these morsels consumes them without truce, and that makes me content, for I am trying in my limited ways to keep this person from consuming large quantities of sugar, if I can help it, which is not all the time. The price for the Feeding on Dreams: Confessions of an Unrepentant Exile seemed appropriate for what we received and for sure they will get consumed. 3 Stars at the risk of being unkind for I did read the many loving reviews about this product.

review/summary: Vegan Natural Raw Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Natural. Raw. Kosher. Wonderful whole raw macadamias. Great on everything. Delightfully tender nuts. Not dry roasted or cooked in oil. No added salt or any other ingredients. Just macs. Value size can be divided for many treats. Great for baking. Melt your favorite vegan dark chocolate and dip and cool for chocolate mac love. Large 2 lb. (907g) package. Portion control highly recommended. Repackage in smaller or snack sized bags. 1/4 cup (34g/1.2 oz) is about 12-14 whole mac nuts. Highly caloric. Each of these full servings is 270 calories. A half serving of 6-7 whole pieces would be only 135 calories. About 27 whole servings or 53 half servings per bag. Great value. Also available dry roasted for those who don't prefer raw, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YV9QMI">Azar Nut Company Macadamia Nuts, Whole, Dry Roasted, 32-Ounce Resealable Bag</a>.

review/text: Worst tasting macadamia nuts ever because they arrived rancid. You feel sick after eating a few. This should not get even one star, it is rancid, meaning it is poison. Can't believe Amazon would sell rancid food and then not allow a way for it to be returned for refund. I will be thinking twice before I order any other food item through Amazon. I don't trust Amazon as much any more.

Two pounds of expensive nuts were tossed out in the back yard to feed the wild life and even the squirrels would not eat them.<br /><br />I will stick with organic raw macadamias, preferably from Hawaii and a more reliable producer.

review/summary: Really fresh macadamia nuts
review/text: I noticed in reading the reviews of these nuts that all the negative reviews were from right around the same time-frame, so I figured it was likely there was a bad lot then and all of those reviews were of orders from the same lot.  I figured I'd take a chance on them since the price (as of today) is outstanding for raw macadamia nuts at a bit shy of $9 / lb, and I'm glad I did since they're really outstanding.<br /><br />They're extremely fresh with no shell fragments, minimal dust, small nut fragments, etc., from processing and I believe in the whole bag while processing into a vacuum-sealed bag for freezing I only spotted a single macadamia that wasn't whole, and it was itself a fully-intact half nut.  Assuming the price is anywhere close to what it was as of when I ordered this bag when I run out, I'll definitely be reordering these.

review/summary: Best price on macadamia nuts for baking
review/text: I make some wicked white chocolate macadamia cookies from scratch, and they're why I purchased the Azar Nut Co.'s Raw Macadamia Nuts.  Actually, I bought the halves and pieces, not whole nuts, but Amazon doesn't seem to carry the halves and pieces at this time.  The halves and pieces were about seven dollars cheaper than the whole nuts.  In any case, the whole nuts are still a far better price per pound than you pay in the grocery store for those little baggies of nuts that you have to buy several of to make a batch of cookies.<br /><br />The nuts come in a large foil bag with a resealable "ziploc" style closure.  My bag was fresh, and perfect for my cookies.  Highly recommend!

The only thing that bothered me once I received my order was that the label says chocolate, not dark chocolate. When I called the company, they told me it is the same dark chocolate that it's always been, that they just changed the label. Honestly, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. If it's dark chocolate, label it such. Even so, the flavor is great, as far as I'm concerned.

review/summary: Virginia's Very Best Jumbo Water-Blanched Salted Peanut
review/text: Royal Oak is the very best at this moment.  There are a dozen other brands that I have tried and, speaking as a former Virginian, this one is at the summit.  They are so large, so crunchy, and so tasty that you will insist on EATING THEM ONE AT A TIME.  The Royal Oak container is still a 40-ounce can, which was once the industry standard.  Many competitors have slipped to 36 ounces or even 32.  Be careful when you select others.  You may not be buying the number of peanuts you expected.  Don't accept any peanuts that were canned over six months ago, as they could be stale.  I am not connected with this company in any way, other than as a customer.

review/text: As my husband enjoys the large crunchy Virginia peanuts I ordered Royal Oak salted peanuts and peanuts from the Peanut Shop of Williamsburg for him.  Hands down, Royal Oak Peanuts in the blue tin are the best choice.  They are very large, crunchy and fresh tasting with just the right amount of salt. The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg peanuts we found to be smaller and they appeared to have an oily film over them.  Not nearly as fresh tasting as Royal Oak Blue label Virginia peanuts. These Royal Oak Peanuts are expensive but worth the treat.  We used to get the Costco brand(Kirkland) of large Virginia peanuts but they have stopped supplying them as of about nine months ago.  I would definitely recommend Royal Oak Peanuts.

review/text: We do have a "Snack Group" at work. We used to buy everything from Pretzels to candy to bubble gum to snack on around 3 PM at work. A colleague got some caramel coated peanuts from his vacation in Williamsburg. That is where our "addiction" to peanuts began.<br />Since I had prime membership on Amazon, I volunteered to buy these peanuts and took them to work. They were an instant hit. The are nice big crunchy peanuts with just the right amount of salt. We love it. I was asked to put in a repeat order within a week of getting these.The goodies were delivered promptly and we rightly have a twin set ready, waiting for the last few peanuts from the previous stock.<br /><br />If I were to make a suggestion, I would recommend the folks at Royal Oak to come up with different flavors, while maintaining the quality of the peanuts. I can see myself subscribing to their products (twice a month delivery), if they come up with flavored peanuts.

review/summary: Just great peanuts
review/text: My family has been through many cans of these wonderful Royal Oak peanuts. The peanuts are large, crisp, and have just the right amount of salt. The biggest problem is trying not to eat the whole can the day they arrive! We have little salsa bowls in which we put 1-3 oz of peanuts at a time to limit the overeating. In addition to using them for a snack they are just fantastic for a trail mix (mix equal part peanuts, M&Ms, and raisins...you will never buy pre-made trail mix again). And they are also great in Kung Pao stir fry dishes.  Oh, the heavy gauge aluminum foil seal that you have to break to get to the peanuts can be deadly if you are not careful. I recommend piercing it with a sharp, serrated knife and cutting the foil out all at once to protect your hands. BTW use the back end of a spoon to pry the lid off the first few times you open the can.

review/summary: Super peanuts- who knew they could be so crunchy?
review/text: My husband just loves nuts.  We usually buy at various markets but really haven't tried getting them online.<br /><br />These were just as described: crunchy, large, perfectly salted and fried.<br /><br />They were really fresh and delightful.  I wouldn't have tried them if it weren't for all the great reviews and I am glad that I did.  In this case, the reviews are accurate.  You will be surprised at how great these are in contrast to many others that are out in the world or online.<br /><br />Try Royal Oak Peanuts.  Excellent product.

review/text: I was looking for Low-Carb snacking food. I enjoy peanuts in the shell, but they are messy. These arrived and when shook made no sound. Nuts always rattle in the can.. Opened the foil sealed can and saw the largest peanuts ever. What a taste! Consistency almost of a dry roasted. Taste was fantastic. I took the can into work and those who tried these were also surprised by the crunch and the taste. I am ordering another second two cans.

They are large and crunchy and with just the right amount of salt for me.  I'm a huge fan of peanuts and I use to buy regular peanuts at the local grocery store but I haven't done that in over a year.  I have only bought this brand since I found them. *Note, these peanuts are awesome with a nice beer like Corona or Dos Equis.

review/summary: Not much taste but LOADS of salt
review/text: I love peanuts and I also love salt but these nuts have very little taste EXCEPT salt.  Believe me, there is not much that I consider "too salty" but these certainly qualify.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, they are bland - not peanut-y.  Trader Joe's "blister peanuts" are far superior to these. Indeed, I think a commercial brand like Planters is probably superior (and much cheaper).  After this purchase, I am still on the lookout for peanuts better than I can purchase in the grocery store.<br />Sorry I got them.

review/summary: Great work and on the go tea
review/text: I am a big fan of drinking tea, and love a good earl grey.  This is one of the best earl greys you can get, unless you upgrade to the loose leaf teas.  It's great at work and on the go, where you don't have time or equipment to brew loose leaf teas.  The tea holds up well through a range of temperatures and doesn't taste as bitter as some others out there.  I recommend brewing it at temperature below boiling to produce smoother flavor (I usually add a little bit of cold water to the cup before pouring in boiling water to control the steeping).  The only downside is it's a little expensive for 15 servings.  Would recommend without hesitation to anybody looking for a decent earl grey.

review/text: The packaging is great for a gift.  The teabags are pyramidal in shape.  As far as taste, if you're just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla, then this Tazo brand will do it for you. If you're looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste, then the addition of vanilla at least in this brand of tea, Tazo, will disappoint you.  The raw rooibos taste, without these "improvements" such as vanilla, is full-bodied and has its own unique taste.  I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings, Republic of Tea, and Numi.

It can't be that bad to use a different glue for the cute tins so we can store rubber-bands in them!<br />It can't hurt your profit margin too much to use another fabric for your tea bags.

review/text: I tried this tea as my introduction to Rooibos.  I was very excited after hearing of the benefits of rooibos.  To my dissapointment I thought this tea was disgusting!<br /><br /> Luckily, I didn't give up and tried other brands (Numi and Yogi are great) of rooibos and they were all fantastic.  This tea has a stale vanilla taste that completely covers up the natural flavor of rooibos.  Stay away from this tea.  Plain rooibos without added flavors is perfect on it's own.

review/text: My veterinary dermatologist recommended these for my 1 year old yellow lab as a crunchy replacement for rawhides while we try to figure out what he is allergic to.  He absolutely loves them!  A large piece only lasts for a few minutes for him, so they're not really a replacement for the rawhides, but at least it gives him something crunchy to chew on to clean his teeth and satisfy his need to chew.  The vet told me that they would stain my carpet, but they don't.  My only complaint is that they are a little expensive.

review/text: These reviews are all from sometime ago, and perhaps what was said was true at that time. But let me warn anyone looking for some good Rwandan coffee right now, do not waste your money. I have tasted true good Rwandan coffee, which is very similar to Kenyan coffee. Most African coffees taste naturally citrus sweet. I don't know what was in the bag I got. The aroma was terrible (like the beans had partially absorbed some odd flavor from something else) and it tasted just the same. I had to toss the 3 pound bag.

review/summary: Wonderful Aroma.
review/text: I've consumed coffee ever since my youth in the 50s. Nowadays I will only use whole bean coffees and I've become somewhat fussy even there. Plus, there's the price to be considered. I've found that Trader Joe's and Kirkland Signature have some excellent selections of whole bean coffees at very reasonable prices. They can be very good values, as well as being excellent coffees. One of the latest I've discovered is Kirkland Signature Rwandan Whole Bean Dark Roast Coffee. I bought it at my local warehouse store in a three-pound bag.<br /><br />The Aroma is the first thing you'll notice. Boy, does this stuff smell good! The aroma is wonderful, perhaps even better than the coffee itself. Please don't take that as a negative statement. I'm just saying that if you want to impress guests, just open up a bag of this stuff and the comments will roll in. The coffee itself is quite excellent, as you would expect. It has a nice aroma and a rich dark taste. My own tastes might prefer a slightly lighter roast, but that's only my own tastes and not the fault of the coffee. If you prefer the rich, deep, strongly-coffee-flavored brew, give this stuff a try. Wonderful! And it's at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />Gary Peterson.

I tried the Sumatra coffee and really liked that as well.  So far I have not been disappointed with any of the Kirkland coffee beans.  I tend to like a more robust coffee and this one fills the bill.  Ever since I started grinding my own coffee beans I can't see going back.  I was almost in "crisis mode" as I was down to less than a pound of coffee and need my morning java.  Give this one a try.

review/text: I have a soft spot for this coffee.<br />As mentioned before, it has no subtlety, and you won't be picking-out notes of blackcurrant or orange blossom or whatever - this is highly roasted stuff that just tastes of strong, strong coffee. I've had plenty of supermarket coffees in the past that were terrible due to being over-roasted to death (perhaps to disguise rubbish beans). Somehow this Costco Rwandan one works though, as a straightforward rich, bitter coffee. It's so charred that when I put it in my hand-grinder the beans just kind of shattered, giving no resistance.<br />Its main selling selling point for me is that it works nicely as a robust espresso (in my Solis Crema SL90), and as a punchy filter-coffee.<br />PS it's cheap.<br />Mmm.

review/summary: Unreliable Quality
review/text: I love dark roast, strong and robust coffees and thought this was a good choice based on the reviews.  Upon opening the bag, the aroma was pungent and acidic, and the beans appeared over-roasted and had an oily appearance.  When I made the first batch my wife observed that the aroma was off-putting, nowhere near the pleasant character some reviewers raved about.  The taste was simply awful - way over-roasted, with an unpleasant harshness that reminded me of burned Chickory or an over-strong Sumatran rather than a quality African coffee.  We finally decided to blend this 50/50 with a medium roast Colombian and that toned it down enough to restore some drinkability.  Most disappointing because I believe the reviewers who loved it likely got a good batch - we most certainly did not...

review/summary: Excellent just pricey
review/text: Love, love these pancakes.  The extra "something" with the chunks of granola put these over the top.  Great taste and texture and everyone in the family asks for them..nearly every morning!  We are already fans of granola so this was fun to try.  My only problem is the 1 pound cans are very small.  This only makes one batch of pancakes for our family.  If just two kids are making them then it will make approx. 2 1/2 batches but that's all.  No, my kids don't eat only one pancake, they eat several...they are just too good. :)  Highly recommend but we, personally, will only order on special or with coupons.

review/summary: Mango Madness
review/text: This matcha is pretty close to capturing the flavour of mangos accurately.  Red Leaf as always has produced a quality product at a reasonable price.  In the mango matcha there is the deliciousness of juicy ripe mangos with the balance of mangos that are just about ripe.  I particularly like this matcha in my morning smoothie!

review/summary: A Good Fruity Matcha
review/text: I love mangoes and I love matcha, so this is the perfect combo for me! However, this isn't your plain old mango tea taste. The mango aspect is quite interesting--it's not juicy mango flesh, but more like... you know, when you're cutting a mango and there's some flesh left after you peel it so you scrape your teeth on the rind to get it all? You get mango flesh, but also some rind-y goodness as well that adds a woodsy, almost tangy taste. Well, that's what the mango is like here! Rind-y. It's kind of nice, quite different from other mango teas I've tried.<br /><br />There's also a hint of citrus, a lemon-y quality. It goes well with the matcha, whose grassiness really adds to the mango/lemon tastes. Refreshing, great iced!

review/summary: Great for anyone who loves matcha and fresh mangoes!
review/text: The smell of this tea is wonderful. It smells like fresh mango juice. I would describe it as a very clean and refreshing smell, which is how I feel about most matchas. I will also say that I had no issues with clumps. I have been very careful to check the temperature of my water before adding it to the tea, and so far have not had any bitter disasters. The mango matcha has a grassy sweetness that definitely keeps the mango taste. The actual flavour isn't as strong as the smell, but I think that it would be overpowering if it was. I love this both hot and iced, which a slight edge going to the iced version. I haven't tried it yet in a smoothie, but I am thinking it would be fantastic. I did try adding a bit to some yogurt, and it was almost perfect - this was the only time I had clumps, but I also wasn't very patient trying to mix it all together. I would definitely purchase this again, and can't wait to try more from Red Leaf Teas.

review/summary: Leggo my Mango!
review/text: After seeing some of the glowing reviews for this matcha, I had to try it. Trying Mango Diablo from DavidsTea recently has brought back to mind my love of mangos and real mango flavor. I had forgotten it in the face of so much fake-tasting mango flavored tea and candy out there. But I used to beg my mom to let me buy a mango. There are few things better than slicing into a perfectly ripe mango. Makes a royal mess to eat it (at least, the way I did it), but it was so, so worth it. Still, I hate messy food, so if I can find that mango flavor without the mess, I am all for it! It was a bit worried about this tea after the strange bitterness of the Peach and Lemon flavors, but what's life without a few risks? Mango makes me think of summer and tropical smoothies and everything delicious in life.<br /><br />So when I opened it, it had that same smell the Peach and Lemon flavors had, a faint hint of bitterness, and I got worried. Still, never let it be said that I'm afraid to try new things. I made a cup of this to take to work with me, and thank goodness I did, it was a hellish day and I desperately needed the energy from it. But...it wasn't that great. It tasted like decent mango flavor with a back hint of chemicals. I don't know what it is, but I think I just need to stay away from the citrus group of flavored matchas. The Peach redeemed itself when iced, so maybe the mango will do the same. I'm hoping it does. My feelings may also be skewed a bit, I've been spoiled by the delicious goodness of the Mango Diablo from Davids, so my opinions on the mango flavor might have been different if I hadn't been drinking tons of the Mango Diablo lately. That's my new standard for mango flavor and this just doesn't match up to it.<br /><br />Still, it will be no great hardship to finish this off, especially in smoothies over the coming summer months. It's not horrible, it's just not for me. But maybe a lower temperature will help or finding another way to drink it. Or maybe one of my friends will try it and like it and then it will have a good home!

review/summary: wonderful tea, works great
review/text: I usually never leave any reviews but since the product is worthy and there's no feedback at all I decided to do it. I ordered this tea because I have some mastopathy and my breasts hurt much during my cycle. Things seemed to get a bit worse a couple months ago so I decided to give this tea a try. I come from a country where there is a lot of trust in herbal medicine, I personally was exposed to Chinese herbal medicine as well so I thought I should try. I drank it for about a month once per day and I already see results! During this cycle my breasts got much better, almost not sensitive at all, just a bit by the very end of it. I will continue drinking it and will recommend it to all my girlfriends with the same problems. It is natural, it doesn't contain any hormones and it DOES work. It tastes very much like regular green tea with jasmine(because it has a small portion of both of them) and that's why I don't recommend to drink it before going to bed because it can keep you up( green tea has a bit of caffeine, a tiny portion). I drink it either in the morning or at  lunch time, it tastes good and helps you to wake up( and unlike coffee, green tea doesn't damage your kidneys).

review/text: I've tried all sorts of bottled and canned pizza sauces for years.  None were better than mediocre and some were really awful.  I would always go back to my "polpo" which I make with a base of Muir Glen diced tomatoes - tasty but still would dump too much water on the crust while baking.  Finally tried the Pastorelli.  BOY IS IT GOOD!!!!<br />Good tomatoey flavor, not over-herbed or garliced, not salty, and it held together when cooking rather than soggying up my crust.  My new best tomato friend.  2TB or so wii suffice for a pizza.  Great stuff!!!

review/summary: Unbelievably the best sauces ever....hands down.
review/text: As a self proclaimed pizza expert, originating from St. Louis, then residing in Chicago, and sampling pizza around the nation, at some of the most prized pizza joints in the country, as well as international attempts...I began making my own pizza's again..this time using Pastorelli's own pizza crusts (thin, crispy style) and the different varieties of Pastorelli's sauces.  The full flavor and balance of spices in this stuff is fabulous enough to literally 'eat if from the can'.  Seriously.  What amazed me is that I have asked dozens of pizza shop owners, and new restaurant 'attempts' at pizza recipes, what sauce they use....many going with food service items from wholesalers (Pastorelli DOES sell food service quantities).  Bland is the word with many sauces, and some too strong in their spices.  This family owned business has this science and art nailed down, and the quality of all of Pastorelli products is premium, without a high price tag.  If you want to really enjoy the best home made pizza, then Pastorelli's pizza sauces are the ONLY way to go.  Buy a can, jar (squeeze), and grab some of their new crusts, and then make up your own recipes and see for yourself.  The sauce 'carries' the pizza.  Their pasta sauces are amazing, yet not easy to find....hopefully their distribution will expand.  Personally, I love Amazon....so I'm set.  Thank you Rick Pastorelli for continuing the best in tomatoes.....<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAXVW0">Pastorelli Pizza Sauce Italian Chef, 15-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Not sure why all the hype
review/text: I recently did a taste test with my family between two store bought pizza sauces. Pastorelli and Don Pepino. They both sell for roughly the same price, both are natural with no preservatives, so the only factor being judged here is taste. The Don Pepino won favoritism amongst my large family by 100%. The issue with the Pastorelli sauce is that it is overpowering to the point that when you bite into a slice all you taste is the Pastorelli. I'm not sure about everyone else, but my ideal pizza is one where the three parts (crust, sauce, & cheese) compliment each other and create a blended taste of all three. The Don Pepino did just that. At the end of the night all of the Don Pepino slices were gone but there were plenty of Pastorelli slices left.

review/text: This generously sized, 7 ounce bar is covered in dark chocolate-a superb combination.<br /><br />Lubeck Niederegger is the best, highest quality of Marzipan! This is a lovely gift-<br />highly appreciated. Keeps for months (keep it cool, OK in fridge).<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is like no other! Search them on the web for the full story. Highest quality Marzipan originated in Turkey, under the Ottomans. When the Turks came up through Europe, all the way to the Gates of Vienna, they brought Marzipan with them. -The Croissant bread (Turkish Crescent)  was developed to warn people the Turks were coming-<br /><br />The Germans, Swiss, Austrians, and Swedes are most renowned for Marzipan in Europe. Check out the Niederegger site -a nice site! Great site-learn about Marzipan quickly-nice story.<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is made with more Almonds, less sugar, filler than others. Simply, ground almonds, rose water, sugar makes the best Marzipan.  No filler, no almond extracts.<br />Lower quality Marzipans need that since they have a lower concentration of almonds.<br /><br />With WWII, the Cafe Niederegger in Lubeck, Germany (East Germany for many years) was destroyed: 1942 "The caf&eacute; was destroyed by bombing and the company's archives went up in flames."<br /><br />Thankfully, the cafe  was rebuilt & this fine Marzipan is still available. With German reunification, it is easier to get this great marzipan again. Highly recommended!
