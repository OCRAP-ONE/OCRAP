review/summary: Excellent! 7 grams potein - and great salty sweet taste!
review/text: I have to say I was very surprised when I tried these bars! I LOVED them! They have a great salty sweet taste with a chewy texture and crunchy nuts. I really liked the 7 grams of protein and the larger size of the bars (length wise they are much bigger than a regular granola bar). Even my picky-eater 3-year-old asked for a second bar! That's impressive! :)<br /><br />If I had to come up with a complaint it would be that I wish they could be lower in fat. Each bar has 12 grams of fat -- however being packed full of nuts the fat content is to be be expected.<br /><br />Overall these bars are excellent! A great alternative instead of having the same ol' granola bar every day. :)

review/summary: a good snack for energy
review/text: I'm a big fan of granola bars, cereal bars, and the like.  I'm also a fan of peanuts.<br />They are a good snack when in need of an energy boost.  Plenty of protein and fiber.<br />I wouldn't call them healthy, though.  They have plenty of sugar in them and are pretty sticky.  I found there was more crisped rice than I was expecting.  And although this is called "triple nut," the almonds and cashews seemed like an afterthought--they are pretty far down on the list of ingredients.<br />This would be a good snack for hiking or exercising when you are in need of some replenishing.  It satisfied my after-work hunger, too, but I don't think I will indulge myself too often, especially if I've had a big lunch.  The 220 calories is a lot for one granola bar--it is 30% larger than most granola bars, but it also has all the extra calories.<br />Both my husband and I liked these bars and would buy more for the occasional snack.  Good, nutty taste.  Less sugary than a candy bar (like a Baby Ruth) and more nutty than other granola bars (like the Nature Valley nut bars).

review/summary: Sweet, Savory, Delicious!  I Loooved These Bars!
review/text: I loved these nut bars!  They have lots of honey roasted peanuts, almonds, and cashews mixed into a granola base of oats, wheat, crisped rice and coconut. But I couldn't really taste the coconut so that came as a surprise to me when I read the ingredients. They are sweet and savory, perfect for a snack when a quick pick-me-up is needed.  They have just the right amount of chewiness, not too tough, but not so soft that the bar falls apart.<br /><br />The bars are larger than regular granola bars, and each one has 220 calories, 12g of fat, 23g of carbs and 7g of protein.  Sodium is 230mg per bar and fiber is 3g.<br /><br />The mouth feel was just right, and the taste was neither overwhelmingly sweet or salty, just a bit of both.  I will definitely pick these bars up when I see them at the grocery store.

review/summary: Great for what it is.
review/text: Make no mistake, this is a candy bar. It is not a "health" bar, "energy" bar or other pseudo-healthy chunk of hemp and flax seed. That being said the Planters Big Nut Bars are good candy. They have a nice balance of sweet and salty, with a very nice texture, somewhere between soft and crunchy. There are plenty of nuts, and the bar is filling and satisfying, at 220 calories it had better be.

review/summary: Tasty but too high in calories
review/text: To begin, I definitely think that the taste of Planters Big Nut Triple Nut Bars is very good.  I like roasted nuts and these are very nutty.  The dominant taste is that of peanuts, but as we know, Planters is known for their nuts.<br /><br />The label states that these "big bars" are 30% larger and therein lies the problem, from my perspective.  They are also 30% higher in calories.  Also, because of the larger size, there are only 5 bars per box versus the usual 5.<br /><br />I would much prefer that they reduce the size by 30% and give me 6 nut bars per box.  This would cut the caloric content from 220 down to about 150 calories per bar, lessening the guilt factor and giving one an extra bar to enjoy.<br /><br />So the product itself is pretty good, but I think that the portion is too large.

review/summary: OK, not peanutty enough for me
review/text: This bar is OK - calorie laden at 220 calories.  It's chewy, not crispy, and while the peanut flavor predominates, I was hoping it would pack more of a peanut whallop, because I love that.  If you are looking for a mildly peanutty, chewy bar, this one is for you.  It just seemed a bit bland to me.

review/summary: WOW - THIS IS REALLY GOOD!
review/text: I've always enjoyed a granola bar or cereal bar as part of my lunch. So I was anxious to open the box to the Planters "Big Nut Bars." I noticed that it was advertised as being 30% bigger than the leading nut and granola bar, possibly to sway the customer in perceiving the value of the Planter's product. The 7 grams of protein was expected due to the protein-rich nuts used in the bar, but what surprised me the most was the 110% Vitamin E per serving. Unfortunately, each box only contains 5 of these delicious bars.<br /><br />The taste of peanuts is overwhelming in a good way. I could taste a hint of the cashews and almonds, but the honey roasted peanuts were like a taste of ambrosia. It was the dominant taste, followed by the crunchy puffed rice and oats. The bottom line is these bars are absolutely delicious! The bar is very soft and chewy, and it won't stick to your teeth like hard caramel or molasses.<br /><br />Pros: Great peanut taste, 110% Vitamin E, good source of protein.<br /><br />Cons: Only 5 per box, would it really hurt to pack 6 or 8 bars per box?

review/text: Often, snack bars are loaded with grains and some artificial sweetener that leaves you wanting something else. The triple nut content of these Planters nut bars hits the spot for me. I enjoy the balance of protein, fat and carbs that are offered by this nutty snack.<br />It's not a diet bar or a meal bar. It instead offers a nutty alternative.

review/summary: Likeable nutty bar
review/text: If you like nuts; peanuts, almonds and cashews, with crisped rice glued together with sugar and corn syrup, then this bar is for you!  The peanuts and cashews are in pieces and the almonds tend to be whole.  Other ingredients include oats, wheat and coconut.<br /><br />The bar actually tastes good and is satisfying for a mid-morning or late afternoon snack. It mainly tastes like peanuts.  Honey roasted peanuts. It does contain 220 calories and 13g of sugars in a 46 g bar.  The bar is not hard like Nature Valleys but a softer chewy bar.

review/summary: Nutty, sweet and a little bit salty
review/text: Okay these are good and I mean eat the whole box in a day good! I'm always buying and trying the newest granola or snack bar that shows up on my grocers shelf, but I hadn't seen these yet.<br /><br />Each bar is packed FULL of nuts, the amount of "filler" is very small compared to most bars. It has a great nutty taste and although I'd say it's close to being too sweet, I think the saltiness helps balance it out.  I do wish that the box came with more than five.  In my household we have two kids which means two lunches and given the odd number....well I guess I'll just have to eat one myself to even it out.<br /><br />These bars are by no means a "health food". Beyond the nuts, which are better eaten raw, this has a good amount of sugar, fat and calories. I'd say they're best for a snack on the go or a treat in your lunch. Planters has brought definite competition to some of our favorite snacks.

review/summary: O.K. snack bars with a big box
review/text: This snack bar has peanuts (most of the nuts in this bar are peanuts), almonds, and cashews, rice crispy sticked together with honey and sugar among others. It is a little bit sweet and salty to my liking. If you don't care about the nutritional contents, it is quite tasty and filling. The box has only five bars in it, but it is big enough to hold ten bars in it. It is kind of deceiving to have a big box with only half of it filled. This is not a snack bar for weight conscious people. It has 220 calories with 12 grams of fat and 23 grams of carbohydrates. So have it when you really need those calories or simply are craving for the taste.

review/summary: Great on the trails or hiking - power food
review/text: I like snacks that are portable, don't require refrigerating and give you energy, curb your hunger and above all taste good. These bars do that all the way! Now, a lot of so called "health" bars are granola based with some kind of soy or Omega 3, flax seed, corn husks, protein curd, magic ingredient, and a ton of promises. Very few live up to them. However, most aforementioned bars are between 120-170 calories with a lot of fiber, and often little fat. With 220 calories, 13g of sugar ( that's nearly three teaspoons folks) and 12g of fat, you know why they taste so good. Like most things they're also fine in moderation. Where they really score is camping, hiking or just doing outdoors stuff. There are no chocolate chips or peanut butter stuff to melt and turn the bar to smush on a hot day, they're light and easy to pack in your day pack or rucksack, and boy do they fill you up quickly. Not recommended for coach potatoes due to the high calorie and fat content, but excellent if you want a tasty treat on the move.

review/summary: Excellent, the best of this Planters line
review/text: I found this bar to be one of the best I've eaten. Planters makes other chewy bars, some of which are quite tasty. But the combination of the three nuts and the larger bar size create a truly excellent blend of flavors and textures: sweet, salty, crunchy, and chewy. With a combination like that, you can't go wrong.<br /><br />The only down side to this product is the fact that there are only 5 bars per package, whereas 8 is more normal. However each bar is larger than other bars. While eating this, one should be aware that the larger size means that there are 220 calories in each bar, more than a smaller bar.<br /><br />But the taste is worth the cost (in money and calories)!

It's easily more than half nuts, and it's a fairly good balance of sweet and salty, chewy and crunchy (though I found the granola part to be about the consistency of Rise Krispie Treats), with generous pieces of almonds, cashews, and peanuts.  It's not exactly a low-fat snack (100 calories from fat but no trans fat) but has a fair amount of protein, dietary fiber, and no cholesterol. It's very tasty - enjoy!

This excellent granola bar is crammed full of nuts - peanuts, almond and cashews. It is delicious, and really hits the spot for that nut-lover in your house.<br /><br />At 220 calories per bar (with 12 grams of fat, and 23 grams of carbohydrates) it's not health food, but it is a delicious snack and quite filling.

review/summary: LOTS of Nutty Goodness!!
review/text: First let me say, these Nut Bars are bigger than your average granola bar.  There is real substance to these babies!  I am not a huge fan of almonds, but these are, for the most part made of peanuts with some almonds and cashews thrown in for good measure.  The peanuts are honey roasted and that sweet, slightly smoky taste is still there in these bars.<br /><br />At 200 calories this is a nice, hearty afternoon snack, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised that the gooey binding was not too sweet OR sticky, a big plus for me.  I like to eat a nice piece of juicy fruit in the afternoon, but if I am running around doing errands, these are the perfect stand ins for me!  I can pop one in my purse and I am ready to go.<br /><br />These come in boxes of five, and since I am a big fan of planters products I am hoping that they are a decent value for the money.<br /><br />These are much better than your average granola bars.

review/text: Let me start out by saying these bars are absolutely delicious. My wife, my kids, and myself all absolutely love them, and a box usually doesn't last more than a day or two in our house. You can't go wrong with the taste, but just make sure you know that these aren't overly healthy. They do have 7 grams of protein, but they're overloaded with sugar and calories, and I think they could have tasted just as good and cut down on that a little more than they did. Either way, Planters Big Nut Bars make for an excellent treat and I would highly recommend trying them.

review/summary: Not a Healthy Snack Choice
review/text: The box describes these as "chewy granola bars", but in my mind, "granola" implies lots of oats or other grains.  "Crisped rice" makes up the main portion of the bar.  Then there's the use of corn syrup as a sweetner.  Not good.  As far as the "triple nut" claim goes, the bar contains mostly peanuts.  A few almonds were identifiable.  According to the label, there should also have been cashews, but I wasn't able to spot any.  The taste of peanuts masks any other nut flavors that may be present.<br /><br />All in all, I wouldn't make this my first choice for snacking.  The bars are high in calories (200 per bar) and pack a whopping 12g of fat.

review/summary: Delicious, enjoyable snack, but watch the nutritional data
review/text: Suffice it to say that I am one of those middle-aged men who, when faced with the absence of snacks in the house, could eat a whole bag of walnuts with which my wife had intended to bake cookies, and then try to convince her that she forgot to add the bag to the shopping cart.  When I saw this Planters snack, I thought I'd never have to do that to her again.<br /><br />These bars are a really savory combination of sweet and salty; a good blance of the two, and the same holds true with its texture; a satisfying mixture of crisp and chewy.  Nut lovers will certainly enjoy these bars, although I thought the size of each bar was actually pretty disappointing (I see that someone added a picture of the bar as compared to a dollar bill at the top of this screen... a brilliant idea!).  The bar is actually smaller than your usual breakfast granola bar, but then again if something contains nuts as expensive as cashews, I suppose it's to be expected.<br /><br />The only thing that concerned me was the nutritional information.  For a 1.62 ounce bar, 220 calaries and 12 grams of fat is pretty steep (this coming from a guy who covers up his peanut habit to his wife over baking walnuts).<br /><br />In short, both my wife and I really enjoyed these bars, and would certainly buy them again, however we both look at them as a special treat and not a daily snack, something that will knock off hunger the way the Snickers bar is so marketed.

review/text: These are more filling than the standard granola bars we used to buy for our sons' breakfast. I especially like Planters Big Nut Bars for road trips as a single bar can sustain my sons (ages 6 and 5) for a 2-3 hour car trip before they start to request another snack.<br /><br />Loaded with honey roasted peanuts, almonds, and cashews, this is not just another candy bar pretending to be healthy. Each Planters Big Nut Bars has 220 calories, 12 grams of fat, 23g of carbs, and 230mg of sodium. The texture is chewy and crunchy with just enough honey stickiness to hold the nuts together.<br /><br />I also like the fact that the bar is easy to eat; our sons can eat one in the back seat and not make a mess. In summary, Planters Big Nut Bars are filling, tasty and perfect for road trips. My rating: Five stars.

review/text: I have enjoyed Planters products for years, therefore it was an easy choice to have these Nut Bars.  My first impression was that it was like the old fashioned peanut bar, but this is more of a "granola bar" snack.  The flavor is sweet, but not completely.  It is NOT the old Planters Peanut Bar, it is certainly a "granola bar".<br /><br />Normally, I don't eat this kind of bars because of the sugar content, but 13 grams of sugar is not excessive.  The bar boasts 220 calorie and over 200 mg of sodium.  And, lots of nuts and flavor.<br /><br />Mostly, these bars are more like candy bars rather than health bars.  Taste is good, great for a quick "sweet fix".  .....Rizzo

review/summary: not memorable, not a standout product
review/text: When it comes to food, I judge it by how memorable it is. When I see the product in a store, was I really so impressed that I am compelled to buy it again? For this product, the answer is emphatically "no".<br /><br />These are mostly granola bars...with nuts added. Fortunately, the nuts are either halved peanuts, whole almonds, or cashew pieces. This creates a good texture, and makes the bars slightly crunchy. However, because these are mostly granola, with bunch of "sweet" ingredients added, they don't taste particularly "nutty".<br /><br />They are bigger than traditional granola and snack bars, which comes at a price -- each bar is 220 calories. Because of the nuts, these contain 12g of fat each. Sodium is also high, at about 10% of an average daily value, or 230mg. Carbs roll in at 8% or 23g, with 13g being "sugars". However, if you're looking for protein (before or after a workout), you'll get 7g. You'll also enjoy 110% of your daily value of Vitamin E.<br /><br />These just don't "standout" enough for me, though. The flavor isn't memorable, and even once the box was empty, I didn't really wish I had more of them. I'm not sure what could be added to them to make them better, but for me they were a disappointment.

review/text: I agree with some other reviewers who like the taste but decry the fact that this snack is loaded with sugar and calories. The bar is an *almost* perfect mixture of that salty/sweet combination McDonald's fries are famous for, but take one bite and you know that it's not good for you, either. I basically ate my samples during a long car trip in order to replenish my sugar levels, but it doesn't do much if you're actually hungry.

review/summary: OK .........But, Too Much Sugar & Salt
review/text: First ingredient is peanuts -- that I expected.  Second ingredient is corn syrup -- that's not good.  The ingredients also include: sugar, evaporated cane juice invert syrup, honey and brown sugar.  Why so many kinds of sugar?  Each bar has 230 mg of sodium.  All of this still does not produce a great tasting bar.  It is okay, but it is too sweet for my taste.  The bar I ate contained mostly peanuts, a partial almond and no cashews.  These might be good if they added some dark chocolate and removed some of the sugar.

review/summary: A bigger bar doesn't always mean a better bar.
review/text: I'll admit it; I'm a sucker for a good snack bar. With a long-standing name like Planters behind a nut bar, I figured I'd give these a try.<br /><br />First Impressions: The box tells us about triple nut flavor of peanuts, almonds, and cashews. It also plays up the angle of being 30% bigger than the average nut bar, and I was ready to dig in at this point.<br /><br />Appearance and Nutrition:  Once opened, I knew that Planter's made good on their statement for almonds and peanuts - these bars are loaded with them. I was a little put off by the corn syrup: the bar is drenched in it.<br /><br />Each one of these bars is 220 calories, with 100 calories from fat. While it may have 7g of protein, there's a whopping 230 mg of sodium in each bar. I highly doubt anyone would want to eat this to fill their daily requirement of Vitamin E, though it has 110% of the daily value.<br /><br />Taste: I liked the nut taste, and the cashews chimed in as a pleasant aftertaste, but the bar was dampened by the overabundance of corn syrup. I compared these to the taste of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZ5FKS">Nature's Valley Sweet & Salty Nut Granola Bars</a>. Their bar may be smaller, but it packs a much better taste, less calories, less sodium, and a better price.<br /><br />A good effort by Planters, but I'll stick with Nature's Valley.

review/summary: Ok...not bad...not great...just ok
review/text: The Planters big nut bars are ok. They aren't too sweet, and actually I would have liked them to be just a little sweeter. They were not as crunchy as I thought they would be for having nuts in them. It could use more nuts than what are in them. I thought they were a bit bland tasting myself, but then again, different people have different tastes. I had my husband and my 10 year old try them. My husband really liked them as he is a HUGE peanut eater. My 10 year old liked them, but said she would only want one once in a great while. I agree with my daughter in the fact I wouldn't want them too often either. So, while they may be good for a quick snack they probably would not be something I would buy very often. They would probably be good to pack for a camping trip for a special treat.

review/summary: Tasty for children, but not as satisfying for health-conscious fitness-oriented adults.
review/text: Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />*** Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies.<br /><br />With its "Triple Nut" label on the front of the box, listing "honey roasted peanuts, almond and cashews", I was expecting a far more nuttier, crunchier experience from these bars.  Instead, the texture is more soft, gooey, and syrupy... not too surprising since the second item in its ingredient list is corn syrup, and it also contains something called "evaporated cane juice invert syrup", which is basically another alternative to high fructose corn syrup.  Nutritionally, I was pleased with its 7 grams of protein in each bar (due mainly to the peanut and peanut butter content), a decent 3 grams of dietary fiber, and 6% RDA iron and 10% RDA phosphorus.  "Mixed tocopherols (to help protect flavor)" is oddly listed twice in the ingredients list.  "Tocopherols" is a fancy name for Vitamin E, and this causes each bar to have a whopping 110% RDA of Vitamin E, which is, for the most part, a good thing... unless you eat 10 or 15 of these bars every day, in which case I wonder if too much Vitamin E would have side effects.  As with processed foods that add "ascorbic acid to maintain color" (ascorbic acid is another name for Vitamin C), I suppose that if they have to use an additive to "protect flavor", you might as well use a vitamin instead of some highly synthetic polymer additive.<br /><br />But the fat content contributing to 100 of the 220 calories in each bar is not so good.  And as someone who thinks that most restaurants and processed foods use too much salt, I could have done with a bit less salt in the bar's taste, and more honey sweetness.  Honey is in the ingredients, but I would have preferred that they add more honey to each bar, perhaps in lieu of having corn syrup second in the ingredient listing.  So that is why I give it only 3 stars: not enough of a nutty crunchy taste and texture, too many calories from fat, a bit too much salt (for my taste buds), and not enough honey sweetness.  The soft gooey texture when I bite into it makes it taste more like a kid's candy bar.  I was hoping for more of a peanut/almond/cashew burst of nutty flavor, and perhaps all of the syrup added to the bar masks too much of the nutty flavor and texture.

I liked them. There is 7 grams of protein and 6 grams of carbs. They are a fast food for on the run when not able to set down and eat right. They could also be a good lunch box snack. They have a flavor of those candy bars that were nuts around the corn syrup center (I can not think of the name.) These are a little more healthy.<br /><br />I would recommend these just to have on your shelf for emergencies.

review/text: You will pay for great taste with a high dose of fat and calories. These may not be the best choice for myself but are a very good option if trying to get some protein into your kids snacks. My family loved these and they were gone quickly. I believe they are a great lunchbox option and afterschool snack. They are much tastier than any granola bars on the market. Who doesn't like sweet and salty?

review/summary: Sometimes you feel like a nut . . .
review/text: I am a big fan of the Planter's Nut Bar, except when I was a kid they were BIG and lasted a long time. Now they've shrunk (but I haven't). So when I bit into the nut and grain variety I was startled. It was almost like my favorite nutty bar, but there was something strangely healthy about it, which went against my sense of delectable unhealthy eating. if I wanted helth, I would have bought a saw dust granola bar. NOT. I guess if your doctor prescribes saw dust bars and you want a little peanutty flavor to them, and chew instead of the delightful crackle, get this one. It left me indifferent to health and yearning for the parent product. Sometimes the old family formula is best left alone.

review/summary: Nutty goodness!
review/text: New Planters� BIG Nut Bars delivers a delicious combination of "sweet" and "salty" and a balance of chew and crunch making it the perfect snack. It's 30 percent larger than the leading nut and granola bar and provides 7 grams of protein per bar. Available in two varieties - Double Peanut (with crunchy peanuts and chewy peanut butter) and Triple Nut (with honey roasted peanuts, almonds and cashews).<br /><br />I don't normally like eating healthy, nutrituous items, but sometimes a snack can't always be chocolates and cookies! So I tried the new Planters BIG Nut Bars...it is not that big compared to say, most candy bars. The main reason I don't like granola bars is because they are hard! I have good teeth, but I fear chipping a tooth when biting into most granola bars filled with the nuts and dried fruits and caramalized coatings...so I was slightly hesitant to try Planter's...but I'm GLAD I did --- they are delicious!<br /><br />Not only is the first bite easy, but all the nuts still have that fresh crunchiness to them. One of the tests that I do when I want to get a granola/candy bar, is the squeeze the outside packaging, if the bar is too hard, forget it! If it's too soft, forget it! But this has the perfect squeeziness to it.<br /><br />The taste is of a Honey Roasted Peanuts, Almonds and Cashews, and yes, I definitely am tasting those together. It's a good mix and best of all, healthy! I always remember in the news and food books, they recommend eating a small bowl or handful of nuts before your meal so that it helps fill you up a bit (and you'll eat less) and that's the nuts contain alot of protein and such goodies for your body.<br /><br />So yes, it's a good snack, tastes good, is healthy --- recommended!

review/text: I enjoyed this project more than the other nut bar that had the peanut butter spread underneath.  This was very tasty.  Held together and wasn't very messy.  Aside from the fact that it has a high calorie content, which peanuts usually do, it is a great snack.  I recommend these over chocolate bars any day.  But, if you are a chocoholic, well, this may not be a substitute, but it sure is a change of pace.<br /><br />The size of the bar is definitely larger than the usual candy bar, so you do get a good size.  If it's big taste you are looking for, this is definitely the product for you.

review/summary: good taste, nicely filling, but corn syrup is so 2002...
review/text: These are really good, we ate the entire box of 5 bars within about 7 days.<br /><br />A big selling point for these is that they have 7 grams of protein, and since we are active people we need the protein.<br /><br />These are not the sugary fare that many people desire.  if you are craving a candy bar then well, you can't really expect this trick your taste buds.<br /><br />What it has is a really well formulated nut flavor.  The size, claiming to be 30% bigger, is enough to satisfy you.  My wife has sometimes felt that she could have thrown away the last bite, but was usually happy she did not.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is that it uses corn syrup, and personally I am not fond of all this corn syrup.  I am very happy to see that many of the items in the grocery store are switching back to cane sugar, and I hope that Planters sees the light.  I won't go into the anti-corn syrup rhetoric here as I don't feel its in the scope of this review.  Just be aware that it isn't very good for you.

review/text: According to the package, these are 30% bigger than your run of the mill granola bar. Seeing that, I was expecting them to just be thinner...but they weren't. PLENTY of nuts of all types blend into a good all-around nutty flavour. There's a butteryness to the stuff that holds the nuts together that's quite nice. And these are chewy without being sticky or gooey.<br /><br />7 grams of protein and 220 calories (100 from fat) make this compatible with other similar bars...but it does clock in a bit high on the sodium 230 mg.<br /><br />If you get these puppies on Amazon, you're also getting a nice deal at 2.80 a box and .56 a bar...that beats getting them in the grocery & you don't even have to pay shipping--just find space for ten boxes. & while we're on the subject, there seems to be a lot empty space in the box. Weird.

review/text: The Planters Triple Nut Chewy Granola Bar is MMMMMMM .... Delicious! At first it tastes like you put a handful of mixed nuts in your mouth (it has Honey Roasted Peanuts, Almonds, and Cashews in it). Then, the bar kind of melts in your mouth and the honey roasted peanuts just burst with flavor. I think this is due to peanut butter (listed in the ingredients, but not visible in the bar).  The rolled oats and crisped rice add texture making an all over great tasting bar which feels good in your mouth. I really like these Triple Nut Bars and certainly will be buying them again. Just a note for the health conscious - There is 7g of Protein, 3g of Fiber, 12g of fat of which 3.5g is Poly Unsaturated, and 6g is Mono Unsaturated Fat, leaving 1.5g of Saturated Fat. It also has 13g of Sugars and 220 Calories per bar. Yummy!

review/summary: Nut Bars Taste Great but High in Fat and Calories
review/text: Planters BIG Triple Nut Bars are delicious and chewy, but not really big. There are 5 bars per box, and each weighs 1.62 ounces but since nuts are heavy, the bar does not appear to be any larger than a normal chewy granola bar. And calling them "nut bars" seems a bit confusing when they are the usual granola bar configuration with extra nuts. A better description would be a chewy honey oat granola bar with lots of nuts. The nuts, incorporated within the soft oat/rice crispy bar, do add a satisfying crunch.<br /><br />Why four stars instead of five? As noted above size isn't BIG, it is the usual size of a granola bar. Additionally, since nuts are high in calories and fat (and good things too) the 220 calorie count and 12 grams of fat per bar make these a special treat rather than a daily indulgence. The main difference between a candy bar and this nut bar is the 7 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber per bar. The bar contains corn syrup, sugar, evaporated cane juice invert syruphoney and brown sugar totaling 13 grams of sugar. There are definitely oats in the bar, but crisped rice is the third ingredient and whole grain oats (in the form of granola) are seventh. Regarding the nuts, peanuts are the first ingredient, almonds and cashews are eighth and ninth. So, from a health standpoint, the bar is good and bad.

review/text: The Amish are known for growing their own foods, marketing their own produce, and respecting nature (all organic) in the process.  It should come as no surprise then that this Amish HOMEMADE GRANOLA lives up to some very high expectations and standards.  The cereal offered here in promptly delivered 1 pound bags carefully packaged contains rolled oats, unprocessed wheat or oat bran, sunflower seeds, dried cranberries, pineapple and bananas, honey, wheat germ, coconut, almonds, vanilla, honey, cinnamon, brown sugar and vegetable oil.<br /><br />Not only a fine breakfast treat or hearty snack, this granola can be incorporated into granola breads that make date-nut or banana bread seem outclassed.  For flavor and nutritional value, this is a solid product.  Maybe the first order will be for one pound, but chances are after that you'll order at least five bags at a time.  Compared to store prices this is a bargain. Grady Harp, April 12

review/text: We have a 4 year old granddaughter and another grand-baby on the way, so when we saw these snacks on Amazon, we thought we'd try them out to see if they would be healthy and TASTY for a child. No good having a healthy snack that the kids won't eat, huh?  Sara (the 4 year old) is such a picky eater that we had serious doubts, and thought she may turn up her nose as she does with so many other healthy foods. She LOVES the Little Ducks! It feels so good to give her something she loves that is helping her grow and develop without all the processed additives and sweeteners. We love too that the package has a zip-top closure and fits easily into a purse. Go to the Little Ducks web site, too.

review/text: I was given a bag of Strawberry and Mango for my 3 year old daughter to try.  My friend knows that I have become an avid reader of a product's ingrediences and its nutritional value .  I was satisfied enough to offer this as a snack for my daughter.  The pieces were easy for her to handle and the snacks easily found their way into her mouth.  As I watched with anticipation for her reaction, a smile spread on her face from ear to ear !  YUMMY DADDY, THIS IS GRRRRREAT !!!  She said it all, she loved them!  Thank you for a wonderful product!  I  will try the other two varieties that you produce !  I will also tell my friends with LITTLE ONES  about LITTLE DUCK.  Also, my ten year old son got a mouthful of the snack and he shared the same raving review !!!

review/summary: Absolutely gluten free crackers and flatbread
review/text: Absolutely gluten-free flat bread and crackers are both excellent products.  I have now placed two orders of 5 boxes with Amazon as the price is more than $2 less per box than in my local grocery store.  Unfortunately, on both occasions, the product has arrived in 85% shattered condition.  Gluten free products are very unstable vs. wheat products.  I would recommend the product highly, but I do not recommend getting them via mail order if shipping standards cannot be improved.  Edith Streubert

review/text: I found this Ceylon Cinnamon is a jar/spice section of the Whole Foods market in Calif. The name is Frontier Ceylon Cinnamon for, I think for something like $5.99. They had the cassia type-not real cinnamon-in the bulk spice section from Vietnam. The cassia type has coumarin and can be toxic. I wanted the Ceylon type for health reasons-good to lower blood pressure/cholesterol-1/2 tsp a day on toast, cereal, breads etc. can be beneficial says some articles on the internet.

Our home is in a small town in rural Virginia and HP Sauce is not available at local outlets; therefore, it is extremely convenient that we are able to obtain in from Amazon.com.  Also, the price is comparable to that in military commissaries.

review/summary: Best Steak sauce in the world, Brits have it right!
review/text: I was introduced to this sauce about 25 years ago by a British friend, and I fell in love with the sauce. It is hard to find in the US, so Amazon had a great price, and I bought a bunch of it. Got it today, had steak tonight.. and mmmm mmmm good! You will love it, hint of Worstchestire, with some Malt Vinegar, and the sweetness of Tamarind, much thicker and better tasting than A1. Use it on everything, but steaks rock with it!<br /><br />************ This is an update, to all those who claim the exp date is past or really close. Do you realize the date is not in the standard American format? That is why it looks wrong, come on folks, it is packaged well, and not expired. I am back to buy more, it went so fast!

review/summary: Love the sauce (hate the date)
review/text: I'll start with the product itself: HP Sauce is wonderful! I described it to the family as being a cross between ketchup, barbecue sauce and steak sauce. They were skeptical - until they tried it. We've gone through 3 of the 4 bottles I ordered in less than two months. When we have guests, they look at the bottle like I imported an actual Brit and they're not sure what to say to him, but fall in love with it when they get a taste. I can get it at the local British foods shop or at World Market, but both stores have the New Jersey bottles, which don't seem to have the same taste.<br /><br />The product is great - the delivery, not so much. Our bottles showed an expiry date that was way too soon, even using British dating (year/month instead of month/year). However, I know dating on sealed products is perfunctory at best - sealed goods can often last up to 10 years if unopened. Still, Amazon (or the seller) needs to indicate that they are selling close to date items.

review/summary: Expiry Dates
review/text: All the good things said about HP are true - a unique product that knocks out the US brands.  One reviewer was concerned about expiry dates of HP Sauce.  A lot of my career has been in food manufacturing since before there were expiry dates.  In the Uk, by law, you have to put on an expiry date and, by law, it cannot be longer than two years out.  But some products go well beyond that.  Sugar or vinegar based products hermetically sealed in glass or plastic are virtualy infinite.  After several - and I mean several - years, you may with HP sauce see some slight coloration change, but no discernable change of flavor and DEFINITELY no food risk.  Note canned goods are slightly different.  They have an internal coating as a barrier between the food and the tinplate.  The coating varies by foodstuff, but over time an acidic content can eat through and cause discoloration and bad taste - but given civilized storage this is always well beyond the expiry date.

One of my friends puts it on her tuna fish (out of the pouch kind)! If you've never been to England or Ireland and you'd like to try this sauce, the closest I can get to describe it is a spicy ketchup, but better (don't think BBQ sauce, because it isn't). We've put it on fries, rice, burgers, steaks, and eggs. Apparently it's good with fish too.

review/summary: Brown Sauce
review/text: To me, this sauce is like a combination of A-1, Heinz 57, and the old Lea & Perrins steak sauces.  It's important to note the dd/mm/yy "best by" dates, but then if you order the four-bottle pack, you get to share with any British sitcom afficionados.  I don't know of any British sitcom that doesn't mention "brown sauce", and this is the "real deal"!  Of course, if I were to use this in my bangers & mash, I'd go through half a bottle or more at one swoop.  Still, it'll happen soon, and I'll have to order more.<br /><br />Refrigerate after opening.  No added preservatives.  Too bad they had to slap a US label on the side for nutrition facts.  I'd like to see the EU standards and peeling the label strips those off.  (I might have to use stamp-collecting techniques on the next bottle.)<br /><br />As the bottle states, "Everything goes well with HP Sauce. It's great on your favourite foods including sausages, bacon sandwiches, and chips.  Why not try on snacks like jacket potatoes or baked beans."  While "jacket potatoes" are just baked potatoes for us Americans, and hardly a snack, what about using it as a dip for potato chips (not just french fries a.k.a. "chips")?<br /><br />Oy, and there's no fat in the sauce!

review/text: I must say the first time i tried HP sauce was in London, and being a fan of ketchup as soon as i tried this my mouth dropped.  I highly recommend this...it is soooo much better than A1 sauce. If you ever see it in the super market...buy the whole stock, you will not regret it

review/summary: HP Sauce
review/text: I think that HP sauce is the best product of its kind on the market.  It is made in the UK, so it is not readily available in many parts of the US. Accordingly, I was thrilled to see I could order it from Amazon!

review/summary: Like the women in my life - FRUITY
review/text: If you are a Brit, you know this sauce is the best to put on 'Bacon Sarnies' 'Dog Rolls' and of course the good old 'Full English Breakfast'. Apparently HP Foods, Birmingham are now making 'Hot' varieties.<br />Wow, I will have to tell my wife she has gone from 'Fruity' to 'Hot'

review/text: There are certain things that must have HP. A bacon butty, sausage & mash the list goes on...Not sure we could live here without it! Add to that Amazon's fantastic subscribe service and the fact they replaced my order because it was damaged why shop anywhere else?

review/summary: Simply The Best!
review/text: I live in the USA and I love the original HP sauce from England. I had found an American version of it a long time ago at a local grocery store but, it was nothing like the original. I put this stuff on steaks, burgers, potatoes, stews, perogies, cabbage etc...My wife thinks I'm nuts but, I prefer this over ketchup or any other sauce any day.<br /><br />Received order very quick and it had lots of bubble wrap. No damage whatsoever. My relatives from Ireland use to always brings a few of the very big bottles over when they visited but, now I can have HP anytime I want thru Amazon.

review/summary: best sauce for meat
review/text: We used to be able to get this imported HP sauce at a local grocery store, but they no longer carry this item.  My husbad was thrilled that I was able to order HP on line and get it delivered quickly.  He uses it on almost everything from steak and pork chops to rice and casseroles to add flavor.

review/text: We placed an order for HP Sauce in February, 2012.  Got the product and put it in the cupboard.  Went to get a bottle out and realized it expired in JANUARY, 2012.  Seriously??  So there we have it... 4 bottles of expired HP sauce.

review/summary: expiration dates
review/text: I received a shipment of HP sauce today, the expiration date on the cap was<br />01/10/2111, in the US this means Jan 10th, however, in the UK this means Oct 1st.  Does anyone know which is the correct date?  I am assuming that as the product is from Europe the latter applies, if the latter applies I give 5 stars if not then 0 stars

review/summary: HP Fruity Sauce
review/text: I just purchased the largest bottle of HP sauce you carry, and am well pleased, but i do have a question for you on the HP fruity sauce which i signed up for the four pack, i naturally thought it would be the four pack of the plastic bottles like the regular four pack HP but was amazed when i saw that it was the small glass bottles at $4.69 each!! I don't know if you are aware or not, but all HP sauce in any Brit supermarket is the same price.<br />Terry Read.

review/summary: beware of expiration dates
review/text: Love the sauce and we're glad to have it, no problems with the shipping and all that, but we bought the 4-pack and they all expire in January 2011.  It's hard to go through 4 bottles of this in 3 months.  Hopefully Amazon will get some better-dated ones, if you're buying them try to find out the expiration dates first!!

review/text: I purchased the sauce as it looked to be a great deal. Typically you would expect a year + on the expiry date, however in this case all four bottles expire the beginning of December 2011.

review/summary: expired due date
review/text: Love the product. We have been using H.P.Sauce for years. However when we got our 4 bottles of h.p. we noticed that the " use by date" had already been and gone. The sauce has vinegar in it so it should be ok for a while but we would have appreciated a newer version of the product. I suggest before you send out food purchases you check the expiration date.

review/summary: Amazing canisters
review/text: These canisters are extremely durable and well designed. There is no after taste or plastic taste when water is stored in them. We carried a couple of these to our trip to New Orleans while working on construction sites. The bottles were thrown around many times inadventantly but nothing happened to them. The BPA free polymer material is very hard and undestructable. These used as water bottles are amazing! Thank you for a great product, made in the great and amazing USofA!
