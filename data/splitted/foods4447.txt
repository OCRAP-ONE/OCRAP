review/summary: Best cookies I've ever had.
review/text: I was given 1 of these cookies from a friend. I savored every bite. After I finished it, I was offered another and I immediately said "YES PLEASE" and I was told I had to buy them on amazon or select states. I ordered the 4 pack. I shared some of them. Everyone that tried them liked them and many of the people are begging me to order more and want to buy them from me. Yes, the Mothers English Tea Sandwitch Cookies are THAT GOOD. If you ever wondered "Why would I ever buy cookies on the internet when there is a large selection at my local stores?" Try these and you will have you answer. If for some reason you don't like them, it won't be hard to find someone to BEG you for more. I know that if they sold these at local stores around here, they would sell a TON. I don't know why they aren't sold nationwide or worldwide at local stores. Maybe they want to keep them "rare" and "special" and not just some "mainstream cookie" and have it be sort of like an "underground special treat", I'm not sure. They are worth every cent of their price. I can't say enough about these cookies. I highly recommend these to everyone. If you have to, have a few friends/family chip in and split it, if you buy the 4 pack and don't like them, you can give the other packs away as gifts/presents. A+ 5 star, my #1 favorite cookies without question.

review/summary: Mother's Taffy Cookies
review/text: We used to enjoy these cookies when we lived in CA where they were made. We missed them terribly when we moved and even bought 8 packs to take with us. When we saw them on Amazon we jumped at the chance to set up a regular shipment to us. They are no longer made in CA but taste exactly the same. They are simply the best and arrive perfectly packed and fresh right on time. There is not another cookie that I know of that's even close!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EDGYN8">Mother's Taffy Sandwich Cookies, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Great Cookies - Mother's Animal Cookies
review/text: I used these as favors for my daughter's circus birthday party.<br /><br />I agree with other reviews, the cookies do seem smaller than what I remember.  Then again, I was a kid the last time I had these, and if you look at the nutritional value, you'll be happy that you get a few more small cookies versus 2 large cookies.<br /><br />They arrived in good condition, a reasonable amount were broken which is expected, even in the store.  The seals on the back of the bags were taped to help prevent them from coming open (much appreciated).<br /><br />They tasted great and everyone from kids to adults were happy to see them as a treat.  I will order these again since I can't find big bags on store shelves.

review/summary: Mother's Chocolate Chip Cookies
review/text: My review is for Mother's Chocolate Chip cookies. I purchased them based on all the positive reviews of this brand. I had never previously tasted them, although I'd seen them many times at WalMart. I thought they would be a less expensive alternative to Famous Amos Chocolate Chip cookies since Amazon has recently increased the price on those considerably. I was very disappointed in the Mother's brand. It did not live up to the compliments expressed in other reviews. They seem to have a strong "baking soda" taste and the chocolate chips have no flavor. I will not purchase these again!

( And could not get a store to mail us some.)<br /><br />  So on to the internet we go, but alas, no "Rippin Good" cookies available, (I have always said, you can find anything on Amazon.Com),  but we did find these great "Mother's" macaroons and must say they really come close to the "Rippin Good" macaroons.<br /><br />We have not given up our quest, short of driving, 8 hrs., we have telephoned another store and this manager has given hope that they will mail us some.<br /><br />Mother's macaroons are delicious cookies, and I took some to work, and one of the ladies there, ordered a case, she loved them so well.

review/text: My sister was visiting and had mentioned these cookies she really enjoyed but had not been able to find in L.A. All she could remember was coconut flavoring with cream in the middle and they were by Mothers. As usual I did an Internet search and got an Amazon hit. I should have known to go to Amazon first. I reviewed the cookies that met the criteria and found Mothers Taffy Sandwich cookies. My sister acknowledge these were "her" cookies. I ordered them and she has not stopped enjoying their great taste. She stated they were as enjoyable as she had remembered. It's always good to find an old favorite.

review/summary: So happy that Circus Animals are back!!!
review/text: I was so distraught to see my favorite cookie company go under and remember buying a bag a couple months after from a second hand seller and thinking "This is probably the last bag I will ever eat!"  Well, I was pleasantly surprised today to have the familiar pink and purple packaging catch my attention from the corner of my eye today.  I bought a bag, wondering if they still tasted the same.  A couple of the cookies were smaller than I remember, but they taste exactly the same:  Perfect.  If you have never had them, I highly recommend you give them a try.  Of all their cookies, the Circus Animal cookies are by far the best in my opinion (which says a lot because their entire selection is absolutely delicious!)

review/text: Original 1 STAR Rating Chocolate Chip Cookies:<br />...12/16/2010 Splendid bubble wrapping AND a pristine box condition deceivingly held 4 packages of crumbles.

To add insult to injury packages have BEST BY DATE of FEB0311 ...less than two months away :( The seller would have done better hosting an ice cream social using these crumbles for toppings. I'm not sure how prospective customers can be informed items are near their expiration date or the condition is sub par, but they should be given the option to purchase "less than standard product". I won't gamble ordering ANY Mother's Cookies again.<br /><br />This holiday will have more cookie crumbs than usual, ugh!<br /><br />9/2/2011 5 STARS ... Coconut Cocadas ... Smaller Version of the Old Time Favorite<br /><br />OMG Still yummy! It was like a stroll down Memory Lane. The coconut flavor carries me back to my childhood in New Jersey sitting on the front steps munching away figuring which adventure us neighborhood kids would be getting into. It wasn't until years later that my Mom weaned us off Drake's Coconut Jumbles and onto these to save money. Though not as coco-nutty  as Drakes's Jumbles these were always available. Neither were as good as any cookies my Grannies made :)

Imagine my dissappointment when I discovered these "New" Taffy cookies are not the same.  They have too much coconut in the recipe.  The old Taffy cookies were darker brown in color and had a completely different flavor.  I wouldn't say these new cookies are terrible, but if you are labeling them as "TAFFY" cookies, they are definitely not a resurrection of the late greats :(

review/summary: My favorite Sugar-Free Syrup for my morning coffee!
review/text: My only complaint about sugar free DaVinci Caramel syrup is that it is hard to find.  For years I purchased this at Sam's club for $2-$3 per bottle.  They stopped carrying this flavor about a year or two ago.  I found this on Amazon subscribe & save and ordered right away.  I was very pleased with how quickly I received this and I was happy to have a never ending supply.<br />****The problem ******This flavor is never available when my subsciption is due.  For the past year I have had to order Torani Sugar Free Caramel, which is good but cannot compare to DaVinci sugar free caramel.<br />I home brew my morning coffee for me & dear hubby.  He prefers traditional cream & sugar.  I use skim milk, sugar free syrup and occasionally top it off with whipped cream (w/ splenda).  I use the same recipe in summer for iced latte's.<br />This is my daily indulgence!

review/text: Yes, it's fake syrup, and it's made with Splenda. That being said, this is WAY better than any of the other caramel-flavored coffee syrups I've tried (especially Torani "Classic Caramel" - yuck!). I don't even like the caramel frappucinos at Starbucks anymore, and I think it's because this caramel is so much better. I like to open the bottle and let my friends sniff it; it has a rich butterscotch smell. I mix this syrup with cold-brew coffee and milk; DELICIOUS!<br /><br />I have never found this syrup anywhere except on Amazon. I wished I would not have to buy 3 bottles at a time, but I ended up giving two away to my envious friends, so now I am back to order more!

review/text: This syrup is good in my coffee with 1/2 and 1/2.  I like the light, plastic bottles.  Like the price of ordering 3 pack.  Like having it autodelivered every other month, but usually run out before then, so I usually buy another bottle or 2 at the store of another flavor so that I have a little variety.

review/text: I bought this based on the glowing reviews here.  I can't understand how people liked this stuff.  It is well and truly disgusting. Thin as water, it tastes like the bottom of an unwashed medicine cabinet.  Because it's not very sweet at all I tried boiling it down to concentrate it.  That concentrated it all right. It now tasted like the unswept floor of a petroleum refinery.

review/text: These work, okay.  They just . . . work!<br /><br />Granted I speak only from experience with three dogs.  But I still challenge someone to post if they've used these and they didn't work.  If you have any dog or cat that won't take a pill, or who can eat the treat you "hide" the pill in and leave the pill (sometimes without you knowing until you find it on the carpet somewhere), this is what you need.<br /><br />My only caution is that you not store them where they'll get too warm or they get too soft and sticky.  If you don't seal them, they dry out after a while, but that's to be expected.  The packets have a zip lock and you need to be sure it is closed.  Like most everything edible they don't have an eternal shelf-life.<br /><br />If you need to give your pet, large or small,  daily pills, large or small - get these.  I even rec'd them to my vet.

Now our dogs twice a day pill is easy to give, in the morning he sits at the bathroom door while I brush my teeth waiting for his pill, since I take mine just before I give him his he stands and starts wagging his tail when I take mine.  We now know he gets his pill down each and every time.  I was very pleased to realize how moist these stay in the package.

review/text: These candies are amazing, and I have loved them since I was a child, but after looking high and low on the internet for them since they do not sell them where I currently live, I found numerous articles that say that these candies contained too much lead in the chili powder and packaging to be sold in the U.S. and were banned first in 2002, as of 2007 they were still banned. I am not sure whether that has been lifted or not, but I had to tell my pregnant wife she could no longer eat the candies she craved so badly just as a precaution. You can guess how well that went.

review/summary: The box is tiny, even at $3 I paid too much - but cute & funny!
review/text: When I bought these the description said 3 oz, but it didn't give a dimension. I thought they would be like an Altoids tin. They are NOT... they are teeny-tiny. I gave them as stocking stuffers so I don't have the exact measurements, but they were smaller than the palm of my hand.. probably 2" by 1.5". I think I paid too much for something that small.., they are so small that it's hard to see all the cute and funny words on the graphic.<br /><br />That being said... I gave them 3 stars (I would do 2.5 if I had that option) because they are seriously funny and they've got cute retro art appeal. If you are looking for something teeny-tiny then maybe this is a good purchase for you. I felt that the description should have had the measurements and I would not have bought them if I knew how tiny they were.

review/summary: Too Good To Keep In The Cupboard
review/text: These are, as advertised, gluten, soy and nut free.  As packaged there are about a dozen cookies in each package - that works out to about $0.67 per cookie.  That's cheaper than the wheat filled cookies placed near the cash register at convenience stores and fast food eateries.<br /><br />They are simply delicious!  There is no way to tell the difference between these gluten free cookies and home made cookies that have wheat flower in them.  They are moist, chewy and very flavorful.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these cookies are addictive.  Remember the old commercial that said "I bet you can't eat just one"?  Well, that's the same story with these cookies.  I find it hard to stop after 4 or 5 cookies!  I don't store these cookies in the cupboard, I keep them handy beside the couch with the TV remote.

Originially we used fresh grapes, but the Thompson grapes work so much better.  They are not sour and just right.  I order Thompson grapes by the box because it is so much cheaper to get 8 in a pack.  Buying a couple at a time can be expensive at the grocery store.  I also find that I can't always find the grapes in stock at my local grocer.  So buy Thompson grapes you will love them!

review/text: First of all, it only took 2 days to get to my place. 3 of the containers (inside the red box) had small cracks at the handle side so nothing spilled. It is very easy to prepare this meal. Microwave on high for 2 mins, stir, re-microwave for 45-60 seconds (make sure to punch some holes on the cover before doing anything). Some might consider this spicy but I had to add some chili powder to it to make it hotter. Anyways, if you have any questions, just comment on my review. Oh, by the way I know a place that sells it around here and they have the chicken on one side and the rice on another. This product (from Amazon) is mixed and better.

review/text: Tandoor Chef truly has the best frozen Indian food by far.  This Biryani is perfectly spiced.  I'd describe it as medium in terms of hotness, which is ideal, because this also allows one to taste all the other delicious spices blending together to create a dining delight. Also, the chicken is flavorful and tendor. In all honesty, if someone set this in front of me on a plate, I'd never guess it was frozen food, it's that good.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I think the portion is a bit small for the price.  However, that will in no way stop me from ordering more.

review/summary: I slightly prefer the 85%, and definitely buy by the box not the bar
review/text: I have and enjoy both the 85% and 90% Lindt chocolate bars, purchased more economically here on Amazon in boxes of 12, rather than as single bars. The 85% bars I am happily able to eat "as is". The 90% ones need a bit of taste help, in my opinion, which I provide by smearing each piece with a bit of Trader Joe's sunflower butter to create what I consider a healthier replacement for a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />I've read that eating no more than 4 squares doesn't spike blood sugar, so that's all I allow myself in any one day. (There are 10 squares per bar.)<br /><br />Definitely recommended!

review/text: The label states this is food for dogs and cats, but my kitty gave it zero stars.  I don't think he took more than one bite of the stuff.  I was surprised at his blas&eacute; reaction, as he thoroughly enjoyed the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048ZB7Q4">Evanger's Evanger's Grain-Free Dog/Cat Canned Food Evanger's Grain Free 100% Rabbit Dog 24 Canned Food</a> I gave him. I decided to still award the product 2 stars because of the ingredients list: beef, water, liver and guar gum.

review/summary: Great, hard-to-find British product
review/text: Camp Chicory and Coffee Essence was originally created as a kind of instant coffee drink, but I like to use it as a topping for ice cream or yogurt, or as flavoring for baked items. Just the right balance of bitter and sweet; not cloyingly sweet like so many flavored syrup products. Common in UK grocery stores, but very hard to find in the USA. So great to find it available on Amazon!

I poured it in a water bottle and shook it vigorously and had great match tea anywhere i wanted.For the price i got it for the matcha was well worth it. I just wished i stocked up on it before they raised the price.

review/summary: great for dogs with allergies
review/text: I recently had a very difficult period of allergies with my 2 dachshunds. My older dog is very picky about treats. he will only eat soft treats, no hard biscuits whatsoever. Now that he has been diagnosed with allergies to wheat, corn, chicken, and rice, I can't find ANY soft treats to give him. He loves the fish treats and they are now his only treat, so I always have some variety on hand.

review/text: No problems with dented cans in my experience.<br /><br />No comparison even to Bush's. But Bush's are not organic so why compare, I don't want the pesticides, but since we are comparing Bush's is a good product, BUT, I find these beans much lighter. Some baked beans are so heavy, not these.<br /><br />Yes, you will want to add some seasoning, but that's why I like them too. It's fun to add different seasonings to fit whatever is being served, so that's not a problem to me.<br /><br />Give me organic and LIGHT beans that melt in your mouth.<br /><br />I've served these to my friends and some ask, "Did you make these from scratch?" They notice the difference and how tender and moist they are.

review/text: I will continue to order this delicious vegetarian baked beans. It surprised me because I wasn't sure vegetarian baked beans could be so favorable without being mistaken for their opposite which is loaded with unhealthy fats, etc.  The size of the can is small and would be adequate for one person and possibly two if neither were big eaters.  I use it over "Tilda" pure "Basmati " Rice which I also bought from amazon.com.<br />Its fun to improvise and makes your cooking life interesting.  Use your imagination with this can of baked beans, and the world will be your oyster. So, all you  non-vegetarians, get with it and enjoy a new style of baked beans.  Buy Walnut Acres Baked Beans.  You'll love them too.

review/text: These beans are great tasting, I don't add a thing, my palate is not jaded. I order these on the re-order plan. The best thing is there is no corn product in them, I am one of the multitudes of unrecognized corn allergy folks. And they are vegan! I'm not a vegan but they satisfy many needs. The only problem is that all but 2 of the cans in my case were VERY dented. And not by Amazon I don't believe, as the dents were on the inside cans. Some one very clumsy is dropping these cans, or throwing them.

review/summary: Love these beans on the store shelf but not through Amazon
review/text: Hate the taste, texture and smell of these cans.  Don't know what the real difference between those on the shelves and these being shipped by Amazon.  But I will NEVER purchase another case of these beans through amazon again.  I opened three cans and all the beans were smushy and covered in a gelatinous goo that completely changed the taste and texture of the beans.  I have a twelve year old autistic son that usually loves these beans but barely touched these from the case purchased here.  Buyer beware....saving a few extra cents on the can is definately not worth it in the end.  The item is nonrefundable so you are just SOL.....Do Not Buy...from here at least.  Walnut Acres usually have a great product.

review/text: The biggest riddle regarding this new Skittles product... Who even notices the color of individual Skittles? I don't know about anyone else, but when I eat Skittles, I do so in a barely-conscious, sugar-fueled daze, usually while staring at a computer screen or the television. Rarely do I even look down as I'm shoveling Skittles into my mouth two or three at a time. So while these new Skittles Riddles taste the same as the Skittles you know and love, the idea of making them mismatched colors is idiotic.

Sheltons also does have medium and spicy versions if you want more spice.<br /><br />We were buying it at the local grocery store but then they stopped stocking the mild version.

review/summary: Disappearing Product
review/text: I would rate this product as five stars without hesitation.  Nutty and full flavored, it resembles very little what consumers have come to expect of rice.  It's actually much better.  I would rate Amazon a zero for offering such a fine product and then failing to continue to provide it when it is still readily available from the producer.  For a truly reliable source for this wonderful product, visit the Lundberg Farms website.  Their products can also be found in many grocery stores around the country, not just "health food" stores.<br /><br />Update to original review:  The reviewer who reported a darkening of the cooking water was not reporting a fluke.  This rice is not dyed, but requires washing in cold water several times before cooking to make sure that all residue on the outside of the rice is removed.  This is not actually a problem.  Just something that should be done as a matter of good practice in cooking all brown rices.  Dark rices give you more visible evidence of the residue, but it is inherent with the lighter colored brown rices as well.  The lighter colored rices produce a kind of milky solution when first washed which clears with repeated washings.<br /><br />After rinsing a few times, the black rice will retain its original color and the wash water should be relatively clear.  Use your hands to rub the rice together when rinsing to do a thorough job.  Removing this residue helps the individual rice kernels to cook without sticking together.<br /><br />Another tip is to coat the washed rice after the final washing with enough olive oil to produce a light sheen on the rice before cooking it.  This also helps the rice to cook without sticking together and adds the flavor of the olive oil to the rice.  Choice of olive oil should complement the underlying flavor of the rice being cooked and the dish being prepared.

review/text: Has this rice been dyed? It sure seemed that way - the broth with which I cooked this rice turned black!  And the broth was needed (vs water)... the rice actually was far less "nutty" or "mushroom-like flavor" than Lundberg contends. I also found that the 50 minutes simmering and 10 minutes standing time was insufficient - the rice was still extremely firm... not even "al dente". It needed 15-20 minutes more.<br />Conclusion: disappointing and unimpressive.
