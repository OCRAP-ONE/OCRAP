review/summary: pH near neutral but so is the flavor
review/text: I have tried this coffee hot and iced,with milk and black and I tested the pH.  Frankly it won't qualify as a great cup of coffee.  The flavor is burnt (like Starbucks dark roast) but is flat and it lacks middle notes and vanillins (unlike Starbucks.)  Perhaps flavors other than French Roast would be better at providing complexity as that frequently comes from Colombian roast in a blend. The aroma is underwhelming.<br /><br />The pH of the Puroast coffee tested at 6.5, slightly acidic (neutral is 7 on a scale of 0-14.0) but less so than normal coffee.  Normal coffee ranges from around 5.0 - 5.1, more neutral than beer or any fruit juice and similar to carbonated water. If you can drink those, then your stomach isn't reacting to the acidity but something else. So normal coffee, whether it irritates you or not, isn't all that acidic.  Acidity generally refers to a flavor note in coffee rather than pH and coffee without acid flavor notes tastes flat.  Irritation may instead come from the essential oils in the beans or the caffeine.<br /><br />(Having too much stomach acid has exactly the same symptoms as too little stomach acid and most people over 35 are slightly deficient in hydrochloric acid and 50% of people over 50 are seriously hypochlorhydric, but we are taught to regard the symptoms as being from acidity. Your Tums work by other mechanisms, beyond the scope of this review.)<br /><br />So while Puroast is attempting to solve an acid/base problem that doesn't significantly exist, the fact that the flavor is low probably means that the essential oils in the beans are lowered as well, making the coffee less irritating.  Frankly I'd rather add about 20% chicory to good coffee, which slightly sweetens the taste and is less irritating.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001M11HI">Frontier Natural - Chicory - Roasted, 1 lbs</a>Is it worth giving up flavor to drink coffee?  Your call, but I wouldn't bother with the Puroast French Roast.

review/summary: Fine for an early Saturday morning
review/text: I'm sitting down to a fresh cup of this coffee on a Saturday morning, with a day of good work ahead of me ... drinking it straight-up, nothing added ... I have to say, it's pretty rich and flavorful. I am the kind of coffee drinker who doesn't have a "pot a day" or anything like that (and some days I don't have any coffee at all), but I can be considered a "Starbucks snob." I don't really like the plain cheapie supermarket coffee, and I can't bring myself to choke down instant. I like flavorful coffee. And this Puroast Dark Roast definitely has a lot of flavor. I cannot tell that it's low-acid. The typical coffee bitterness (I tend to like it strong) is nice here. Good stuff.

review/summary: I Can Have A Second Cup!
review/text: I tried the Puroast low acid French Roast coffee and I really liked the taste and the smoothness of the coffee.  The fact it was low acid enabled me to have a second cup of coffee without experiencing any of the discomfort in my stomach I would have with my regular coffee, which is Starbucks House Blend.<br /><br />This is really good news for me since I love coffee.  But, as someone who suffers from stomach ulcers, one cup of coffee was my limit.  I also did a side-by-side taste comparison with my usual Starbucks and the Puroast low acid coffee came out on top.<br /><br />I finally found a coffee that satisfies my taste buds without aggravating my ulcers.  Here's to a second cup of coffee without the pain.

review/summary: Low Acid Indeed, but Darker Roast than I Like
review/text: Since I suffer from GERD, or acid reflux (heartburn), I was immediately interested in this product.  It's a good idea, since I (like billions of other people around the planet) love a cup of coffee in the morning.  But coffee is a big no-no for those with GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disorder).<br /><br />I brewed it up in my Chemex coffee maker (all glass, no plastic parts).  My first impression was that it is a dark roast, which I'm not particularly fond of.  (The company, according to its website, offers two styles of coffee.  The dark French roast was what was sent to me.  They also offer a 'nutcracker sweet' flavor).  Secondly, the grind is very fine, which releases more flavor, but takes longer to drain through my filter.<br /><br />The taste (which is the important thing, right?) is strong and slightly bitter.  When I added sugar and creamer, the taste was tamed into something more than I'd like.  The flavor is unchanged from a regular coffee flavor, which is certainly a big plus.<br /><br />I could tell right off that the coffee was less acid than traditional coffees.  And it certainly didn't set off my GERD (though mine usually comes later in the day).<br /><br />One caution I'd issue though.  According to the pamphlet on GERD I just picked up from the doctor's office, one reason (the principal one?) that one should avoid coffee and certain sodas is the caffeine in coffee.  I assume that the coffee has all of the 'kick' that traditional coffee has.  So it seems that one drawback to coffee (acid) has been solved, but the other (caffeine) remains.  I'll finish off this small bag and see what I think.<br /><br />All-in-all, I'd recommend this coffee to the lover of a strong dark French roast.  I think I'd prefer the Nutcracker Sweet variety, personally.  The coffee costs about the same as regular coffee, according to a quick price survey I ran on Amazon.

review/summary: smooth cup of coffee
review/text: This French Roast coffee blend from Puroast is very deep and smooth. Definitely full-flavored, and no tummy torture involved! I love my coffee, and I refuse to give it up even though I sometimes have stress-related stomach problems. I would love to try a house blend or medium roast coffee from Puroast coffee. I visited their website, and they offer a wide variety of coffees, including some very delicious-sounding flavored blends like "Nutcracker Sweet" and "Brazilian Sunset"! Don't give up on coffee until you try Puroast!

review/summary: Medium Bodied and Smooth
review/text: This coffee was satisfying.  I prepared it in a Kuerig machine using the one cup mesh filter and had no grounds seep through even though the grind was fine. I enjoyed my morning coffee and was surprised to find a pleasant after taste unlike the ones I usually experience that sending me running for mouthwash to eradicate "coffee breath."  I attribute this smooth taste to the low acid content.  I usually drink a full bodied bold coffee but could switch to this for the benefit of the low acid.

review/summary: Wierd smell, funny taste, lasting aftertaste
review/text: I could tell as the pot of coffee brewed that this was not going to be my type of coffee.  The smell was not that of a good strong smelling, fair trade bean that I am use to.  It is hard to describe but the smell was slightly better than my tennis shoe.  Despite the smell, I still gave it a fair chance.  As I sipped on the first cup, I kept saying to myself, "this will get better."  I thought I just needed to get use to it.  While I was able to finish two cups, I cannot say that I enjoyed them.  I cannot describe the taste other than to say that it was an original coffee taste.  It's something I have never tasted before in a coffee.  And the aftertaste was super long lasting.  In fact I brushed my teeth twice and was still tasting the coffee an hour later.  As far as being easy on my stomach, it was no different than other coffee.  I still had to use the toilet after I finished my second cup.  I would not pay money for this product.

review/summary: Low Acid Coffee
review/text: Yes it is low acid and doesn't cause acid indigestion or heart burn. It had a really full bodied aroma while brewing but fell a bit short on taste - but I'm a black coffee drinker so sharpness & flavour are very noticeable to me. My husband (who does take cream & sweetener in his coffee) said it was a good cup of coffee to his taste.<br />I think it may have been the "dark french roast" that to me tasted a bit "woody".<br />So I'll give this 4 stars & try again, with a different roast.<br />My final analysis is, if you get heartburn or acid indigestion drinking coffee, this is the answer to your prayers. But I wouldn't recommend the Dark French Roast - unless you take cream with your coffee.

review/text: I ordered this for my father who always gets heartburn from certain types of foods, including regular coffee. Basically it's a great find if your digestion doesn't handle coffee - he didn't have any problem at all from this blend. As others have commented, the flavor tastes very light and may be too weak for some, though it depends on whether you're used to overpowered Starbucks or more subtle brews. It's also not cheap but he said it was worth the extra cost to enjoy a cup of morning joe again!

Of course, preparing coffee at the proper temperature is a key to extracting the correct oils from the bean.<br /><br />I liked the fact that this coffee comes in 3 ounce bags, perfect for a normal pot.

review/summary: Low-acid Coffee Boasts High-Level Taste
review/text: Surprisingly, Puroast's low-acid French Roast blend actually has a rich, full flavor that has a deeper taste than most standard store brands, i.e. Maxwell, Folgers, Hills Brothers. I expected a flatter taste from a low-acid coffee but was pleasantly surprised. But then I discovered that Puroast had received favorable ratings in taste tests conducted by the Wall Street Journal and Newsweek. I also learned that coffee in its natural state is low acid but the roasting process converts coffee to a high-acid drink.<br /><br />Puroast has seven times lower acid levels than the leading brands of coffee. That is good news for people who suffer from heart burn, acid reflux, and other kinds of stomach irritation. Puroast Coffee [...], rich has its roots in South America, introduced the low-acid brews in November 2005.<br />Puroast comes in regular, decaf, medium roast, house blends, and organic blends in either whole bean or ground format. Among the low acid flavors Puroast offers are chocolate almond, hazelnut, Irish cr&egrave;me, mocha java, and vanilla.<br /><br />Puroast coffee products are available at amazon.com and a major chain store I refuse to shop at. If you quit drinking coffee, or cut down on your coffee intake, because of a sensitive stomach you will enjoy the health benefits as well as the rich taste of Puroast low-acid coffee.

review/text: You wouldn't know from looking at it that this is a low-acid coffee; the grounds are the same black shade as any other dark roast and just as fragrant. It brews up just as dark with the distinctive French roast aroma of normal coffees. I normally can't drink French roasts because they are too harsh on my stomach, but although this one tasted like a dark roast it went down as smoothly and agreeably as a light roast!<br /><br />If you're a Panera Bread fan, this reminds me strongly of their dark roast - except that I can drink this!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys rich coffee but could do without the acid. It arrived very promptly, and I found the package size/shape to be ideal for both travel and gift baskets.

review/summary: Smooth and roasty
review/text: I'm more of a Folgers drinker than a connoisseur of fine coffee, and like to taste the coffee instead of that roasted taste you get at Starbucks.  That said, this does taste like a smoother version of that sort of roasted coffee.  I thought the coffee taste was reduced, and the roast taste enhanced, compared to what I'm used to.  I believe this is partly due to the acid reduction.<br /><br />The acidity is reduced (unnoticeable!) and I love this aspect.  I sometimes have heartburn, and this low acidity coffee was simply more comfortable to enjoy.  I drank the entire half-pot of coffee produced by this packet in about an hour, and I have absolutely no stomach trouble at all.  If I drank that much Folgers so quickly, I would feel significant pain.<br /><br />The grind was on the finer side, but just barely coarse enough to be used in a coffee press.  Actually, it's the perfect size of grind, which I am quite picky about.  It would work fine in a standard percolator too, of course.<br /><br />Regardless, it is tasty coffee that is precisely as advertised.  If you like roast coffee and need low acid coffee, this is exactly what you wanted.<br /><br />I am only deducting a star because it isn't a strong value for the price.  Yet I will probably buy a single box of this, and only drink it when I'm having heartburn.

review/summary: Full-bodied coffee with no aftertaste
review/text: This coffee is sold as a low acid alternative for those that experience stomach problems from reflux and heartburn. Their research backs up this claim. For those with those issues, I recommend that you give this brand a try. Not only does it work, but it has a great coffee flavor. I also like that it is pre-packaged in 3-oz bags, which is great for taking on trips, and avoids the daily routine of measuring.<br /><br />For me, my morning coffee is something that I truly enjoy and will not compromise on. I'm a Seattle's Best fan and have been drinking their French Roast (now #6) for years, so I was looking forward to trying this French roast and doing a comparison. The first good sign that I noticed is that this is a fine grind, which allows me to use a little less to get the results I like. I used six tablespoons of this coffee to prepare about 7 1/2 cups of coffee, so one 3-oz packet will make a complete pot. It came out just right and tasted very much like the SB. I did not notice any aftertaste or stomach issues.<br /><br />Again, give it a try, especially if you experience stomach problems from regular coffee. If you're concerned about price, enroll in Amazon's subscription service, which affords additional savings and regular delivery.

review/summary: Coffee - it does a body good
review/text: Got to hand it to them - it is a smooth cup of coffee. My sample was the Dark French Roast. Normally I do not care much for French Roast because it is over cooked in my opinion.<br /><br />I drank it black to get a good sense of the flavor. Since it is darkly roasted it doesn't have a lot of subtle tones to it like lighter roasts have. It has the twang that this level of roast imparts on coffee and, of course, a strong coffee flavor. I tend to drink my coffee a bit on the strong side anyway - a tablespoon heaped a little per ~12 oz of water.<br /><br />For the last several years I've been brewing my coffee a cup at a time with a Melitta #4 filter and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001794Q0S">Melitta Ready Set Joe/Mug 64010 Coffee Makers Speciality</a> (although I bought just the filter cone) and an electric kettle. If you've never tried it this method is the only way you'll get a great cup of coffee every single time. I had a liter thermos and a different filter cone and brewed it by the pot this way too. Excellent coffee every time.<br /><br />At any rate, I mention that to say this - for pre-ground coffee this is a pretty good cup of coffee. I'd be willing to bet that the Columbian roast is excellent too.<br /><br />For those of you that think 'eh coffee is coffee' I've got two words for you ... 'Chase Sanborn' Ug. Awful stuff with a chemical flavor.<br /><br />I have to say that the low acid claim seems to be exactly right. I got the sample in the mail today and just made a cup around 3:30 in the afternoon. Sort of late for me to drink coffee and on a mostly empty stomach but I don't feel like I need to drink a bunch of water to dilute the coffee.<br /><br />I like it. Give it a try. Give the Meletta cup at a time thing a try too.

review/summary: Different, gentle, mild flavor
review/text: I'm somewhat ambivalent on this product; you can tell from the get-go that it is quite mild, almost gentle on the taste buds (and almost nonexistent on the olfactory senses). It comes in a 3 ounce foil sealed packet (I got 10 in a set); the coffee is very fine (almost like dark brown sawdust from a 320 grit sandpaper).  I would compare this product to ganocafe classic; the two are similar in texture and flavor (except the ganocafe comes in 1 ounce packets and has no caffeine).  One of my slight problems with this product is it comes with NO DIRECTIONS.  I assume you just measure out what you would usually mix for your coffee and put in your drip coffee machine and process as usual.  However, the ganocafe just mixes directly with hot water (very convenient if you are on the go or whatever); I have the feeling you can do the same with this product (just mix directly with very hot water).  The question is how much product to what quantity of water should the ratio be (ganocafe is one ounce to 6-8 ounces of water).  I guess one of the true tests of coffee is how does it taste (or can you even drink it) when it is cool (not iced, not hot); this coffee is still drinkable even when cool.  If you are looking for a product that will not mess up your stomach, I think this product will do the trick.  (However, as a final plug, ganocafe will also do the same thing; however, ganocafe is expensive, and you have to go through a bunch of hoops to get it--like become a distributor, buy at least 60 dollars a month of the product, etc.--I did for a while, accumulating years worth of the product--since it is in tiny foil sealed packets, it will last for years).  Note the four stars is primarily because I believe the product will do as advertised (the low acid amount) and the taste is acceptable (true connoisseurs of coffee will turn up their noses at this product). UPDATE:  I got sample packets; the "regular" item DOES COME WITH BREWING DIRECTIONS.  You also can't brew it directly in a cup (just add hot water will not work without complications.  Their phone connection system was excellent, no automated garbage, quick real live person with answers who actually lives in the U.S.  Oh, ALL coffee has some caffeine, just how much (sorry about my earlier comment). One final thing, there is a cold brew coffee  technique called Toddy Coffee; you just put a pound of coffee in a special plastic container, put in some cold water (first 4 cups, then 5 more), let it sit for 10-12 hours, and drain through the filter at the bottom.  You then heat up water and put whatever amount of this dark liquid in the water (usually two parts water to one part liquid coffee. This cold process coffee is extremely mild, much like puroast, except you have your choice of which coffee you want to use.  The downside is you have to use a full pound of coffee (well, you can halve the recipe), and you don't get that much actual coffee (liquid).  Still, it tastes great.

I would certainly recommend this not only to those who need a low-acid blend, but to anyone looking for a full bodied, but mellow coffee. I suspect this would be great with pastry or danish and as an after dinner drink. I made it using an ordinary, decent drip machine and it came out wonderfully. I like this coffee a lot.

review/summary: Not bad coffee... but is it worth it?
review/text: Do you get heartburn with coffee?  Before I started my little purple pills I did, and now I get to enjoy all the drinks and foods that used to burn my chest and torment my sleep.<br /><br />I was intrigued when I saw this product with the description: "Puroast Low Acid Coffee introduces our great taste, low acid coffee in a single pot, 3 oz. size which is great for the office, home, or travel. Puroast Low Acid Coffee offers consumers who a great tasting, smooth coffee that is proven to give symtpom (sic) relief to consumers who suffer from heartburn, reflux, and other related conditions."<br /><br />I got a pack, and it wasn't bad coffee, and I didn't get heartburn, but I haven't had it in years since I started the medicine.<br /><br />Alas - I also had a medical school education which allowed me to know that "stomach acid" is not only a real thing, but its hydrochloric acid, literally about the strongest acid possible.  One of the amazing things about human physiology is that our stomachs are designed to successfully hold that caustic solution.  Our esophagus is not, and when the sphincter between the stomach and throat is weak - even momentarily - the stomach acid splashes up into our esophagus and causes the familiar "heartburn."<br />Methylxanthines are common substances that will relax the sphincters in our body, and they're found in high quantities in caffeine and chocolates, for example.  So - how useful is a "low acid coffee" in preventing the actual cause of heartburn if it has the desirable caffeine?<br /><br />I wrote the Puroast people and pointed out these things and they wrote me back with links to research done by biochemists on coffees.  I was still scratching my head over what to write in my review when I got an email from the CEO of Puroast! Yeah, I was surprised!  Anyway, he wrote:<br /><br /> "Puroast does not make a claim as to the correlation between the pH<br />of its coffee and the causes of heartburn/reflux, only that the coffee has<br />significantly lower acid content (up to 80% lower) than leading commercial<br />brands."<br /><br />So - "Puroast Low Acid Coffee offers consumers who a great tasting, smooth coffee that is proven to give symtpom (sic) relief to consumers who suffer from heartburn, reflux, and other related conditions." - isn't a claim that there is a correlation between the ph of its coffee and the causes of heartburn?  Am I being trivial to point out that their product description misspells "symptom" and that the package I received misspelled "gourmet?")<br /><br />So - is it good coffee?  It ain't bad.  It's absolutely worth drinking on the basis of its flavor alone.  But is it worth >15 bucks for 10 one-pot bags?  I'd try the larger bags first.  Or I'd keep taking my purple pills and keep drinking the coffee that tastes best to me.

review/summary: "It tastes like gasoline" was the first reaction I heard...
review/text: Sunday breakfast - sausage and bell pepper scrambled eggs and a piping hot mug of coffee.<br /><br />This morning that coffee was the Puroast Low Acid French Roast...I received one bag to review and it had enough coffee inside to make 8 cups, so I went ahead and brewed the whole thing.<br /><br />One in the household is a coffee purist and drinks it black, while I prefer sugar-free creamer. I poured the mugs, sat down to breakfast and waited until it was a bit cooler to drink. I was the first to take a sip and even with my creamer there was an underlying bitterness that hit me hard. I paused a moment, took another sip and the same bitterness was there.<br /><br />So I asked for additional feedback from the coffee purist. The first words out of his mouth: "UH! It tastes like gasoline! It takes like...fuel!"<br /><br />Forgiving the fuel pun, we explored the coffee a bit more and it seriously got worse. I grabbed the pot from the coffee maker and took a deep breath. Bitter, foul, with an undertone of...you guessed it...gasoline. I wanted to make sure this wasn't just a gut reaction so I asked for another opinion. The purist took another sip. "Yep, gasoline or some kind of fuel taste...and I know what gasoline tastes like."<br /><br />Ignoring how he knew what gasoline tasted like, I grabbed the pot of coffee and dumped it in the sink. Really disappointing way to start the morning, and I'm sorry to say that I won't be purchasing this brand - even though I like the concept of the low acid brew. But if you want to stay all natural low acid, just go with a wonderful Hawaiian Peaberry vs. something that has been "processed".<br /><br />1 start out of 5.

review/summary: This could be god-sent or "donau-wasser" depending on who you are
review/text: I do not suffer from heart-burn or other stomach ills that are related to acidity of my food. I am an average coffee drinker.  I don't have to drink decaffinated coffee, and I don't make a point of drinking only gourmet coffee either.<br /><br />This coffee claims to be the answer for the needs of those who are acid-sensitive.  I can see why, because I can taste the low acidity.  It adds a certain degree of smoothness and drinkability.  The aroma is good, it is inviting, and the after taste is quite pleasent.  Even though I don't have to drink low-acid coffee, I could drink this coffee daily, and I could be content.<br /><br />Then, there is the other side of the coin.  If you are a true gourmet coffee drinker, you probably will be very disappointed with this one.  If you are happy with the "house-blend" at "Starbucks", you will likely be happy with this one too.  If you only drink some of the specialty brands of coffee from "Peets", then you should not even consider buying this one.<br /><br />Finally there is the price.  I am accustomed to pay this kind of price for top of the line gourmet coffee, but I consider it on the high side for this kind of product.

review/summary: Heaven in a cup...
review/text: I brewed this in a Bodum Coffee Press. The grind is a little small for this method, but the results were worth a little "mud" at the bottom of the cup.  Rich, deep, and really delicious, this French Roast is so mellow, it's positively addictive.  If you enjoy a strong brew but don't like the hit of acid you get from a Starbuck's or other "seattle" type coffee, you will fall in love with Puroast Low Acid French Roast.<br /><br />I initially made two cups (or one big mug), but couldn't resist the temptation to use the rest immediately afterward. This is now my favorite coffee by far. The taste is incomparable, and it's nice to know you can drink as much as you like without coming down with an acid stomach. My only regret is that I did'nt save it for a Sunday morning when I could have spent more time savoring it.

review/text: I often get a sour stomach from drinking coffee, so I thought I'd give Puroast a try.<br /><br />Just as methods of decaffeination often affect the taste of coffee, so does whatever technique they used to reduce the acidity.<br /><br />It's a shame, because the fresh grounds had a wonderful aroma, but the brewed coffee had a bitterness beyond what I normally associated with acidity. As a result, the flavor didn't have much dimension.<br /><br />On the plus side, there were no negative stomach effects, so I suppose if I wanted the caffeine and wanted to avoid the possibility of a sour stomach, this would be a reasonable alternative. That's an unlikely scenario, though.

review/summary: Too Dark for Me but Packets Good for Christmas Baskets
review/text: I usually drink Gevalia medium roast or Dunkin' Donuts brand coffee. I have a 4 cup coffee maker and I use about 2 tablespoons of coffee per 4 cup pot.<br /><br />I used slightly less with this Puroast coffee because it's a French roast but even using slightly less, it was just too dark tasting for me. The second pot I made, I used even less - maybe a scant tablespoon and a half and it was still not for me. Even adding a good sized dollop of fat free half and half didn't make me want to finish the cup.<br /><br />However, I have lots of relatives and friends who like their coffee VERY "full bodied" and I think they'd like this. I just ordered some logo imprinted, insulated travel coffee mugs for my husband's business and I'm strongly considering ordering some of this to include with the mugs at Christmas time when we give them out to those my hubs has done business with.<br /><br />I see this brand comes in lighter roasts and I wouldn't mind having some of that on hand for friends/relatives who come to visit who I know have acid reflux/heartburn issues. For myself though, I think I'll stick to my favorites.

review/summary: It May Be Low Acid, but it Still Gave Me Heartburn
review/text: I have several health issues that prevent me from drinking coffee, and have really missed being able to start the day with a steaming hot cup of wonderful smelling coffee.  The slightly high price tag would have been worth it if this product had lived up to its hype.  I had hopes that this brand would be different, but it wasn't.<br /><br />The morning after this arrived in the mail, I had a friend over for morning coffee and we both had a cup together.  I brewed it using a drip method and we sat down to see if this really was better than the average coffee.  She thought it tasted very good, but I didn't think the taste was anything special.  Still, I hoped it would leave me feeling better than coffee usually does.<br /><br />At first I was OK, but about an hour after drinking my coffee, the old, familiar burning sensation in my gut started.  Then, the inflammation in my joints and soft tissues.  This experiment had failed miserably and I had to endure an entire day regretting that I had tried this coffee.  At midnight, I was still feeling bad from a cup of coffee I had drunk at 8:00 am.<br /><br />Just a side note about low acid coffee:  ANY coffee (no mater how cheap) can be made low acid by a cold brewing method.  Just type "cold coffee brewers" into Amazon's search engine and you will see all kinds of contraptions that will make low acid coffee.  It is the brewing method that develops acid, and not the type or brand of coffee you use.  ALSO, there are health problems associated with coffee that have little to do with acid. If you have any kind of inflammation, brewing low acid coffee will not help that because coffee is intrinsicly inflamatory.<br /><br />I will not be using the rest of this.  It might be low acid, but it seems that any acid at all is too much for some people.  Coffee is just not worth the consequences for me.<br /><br />UPDATE - October 2, 2011:  5 DAYS LATER, my joints still hurt from this experiment.  My daughter is a professional barrista, so I gave her a cup to try and asked for her "expert" opinion.  Her verdict was that it is poor quality coffee that is extremely bitter.  Not a very good reccommendation!

review/summary: Not the Best Part of Waking Up
review/text: At first I was disappointed by the size of my three ounce sample of the Puroast Low Acid Coffee. Would I be able to form an opinion with such a small amount?  Yes, Yes, Yes, definitely yes.<br /><br />Upon opening the envelope I was overwhelmed by the aroma and checked the envelope again to make sure I hadn't opened a package of loose tobacco. The brewed coffee didn't smell any better as the kitchen was filled with a smell like a dirty ashtray. The taste is not better. I dutifully drank three cups so I could give it a fair assessment, and the last cup tasted as bad as the first. I even added a spoonfull of chocolate powder to the last cup to make it palatable. That only helped marginally.<br /><br />I'm a long time, daily coffee drinker, and this may be the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. It may be low acid and make one's tummy feel better, but it's a big price to pay for the comfort. Now I'm disappointed that I still have a little of this stuff left. Definitely don't recommend this flavor.<br /><br />Why didn't I give this foul tasting brew one star? I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt because evaluating taste is a subjective thing, and after all there is that low acid factor to consider.

I thought I'd give this a try to see if the low acid version would make my stomach feel better.<br /><br />It has a very strong, deep aroma. Very much like being in a Turkish coffee house. I found the taste too strong, even when diluted in half with mild. It's pretty potent!  My husband however, thought it was fantastic. So if you love a bold, deep coffee but can't deal with the stomach pains it can create-give this a try.<br /><br />I'd be interested to try some 'lighter' blends if Puroast creates any.  I do appreciat the low acid aspect, and I think they could reach a wider audience with different blends and perhaps even flavored options.

review/text: This is a difficult review to write.  I have reflux and coffee is a major trigger.  I LOVE good coffee, dark, strong, robust coffee.<br /><br />I was so happy to find this product and had hoped I could "have my coffee and drink it, too."  It is not to be.  I would rather have nothing than drink this.<br /><br />Coffee is such a personal thing.  I know most people drink it because they are addicted to caffeine (otherwise there would be NO on buying the majority of the coffee sold in grocery stores).  I drink coffee because I absolutely love the taste (I normally drink decaf everything so caffeine is not a factor for me).<br /><br />For those who absolutely cannot have coffee and aren't particular about flavor, I think this product will be a godsend.  Just like the gluten free products are godsends for celiacs, but you won't catch me eating them either!

review/summary: Coffee that's low on acid, but also low on punch
review/text: For those who normally steep a few Rolaids or Tums in their mug of Joe, a low-acid coffee seems an ideal alternative to those upset tummies. Puroast Low Acid French Roast is one such alternative, but there is a definite trade-off. The coffee is certainly low on acid, leaving me feeling well after a cup or two. But, the Puroast lacks that robust bitterness that regular coffee has, making it less rewarding on the palate. It's not that the flavor is undesirable -- in fact, it tastes just fine; it just isn't as rich, due to the process of removing the acidity (?).<br /><br />Overall, Puroast will certainly due in a pinch, and is great for those who suffer major acid indigestion from consuming regular coffee. But if you can tolerate a little discomfort and don't mind taking Pepto, you may wish to stick with your grande latte from Starbucks.

I gave it four stars because I felt the need to recognize that there wasn't anything wrong with it; it was coffee.  It was drinkable; there was nothing wrong with it.<br /><br />I just didn't love the taste, that's all.<br /><br />I don't know if this taste is a reflection of its low-acid content.  Moreover, if I were to attempt to describe how I perceived the taste, my description could come off as vaguely insulting; worse yet, I should have enjoyed it.  It had a sort of harsh taste, in my opinion, of a type I enjoy in other beverages such as unsweetened tea, particularly lapsang souchong.  Don't know it?  My friends describe lapsang souchong, variously, as smelling and tasting like stinky feet, motor oil, and dirt.)<br /><br />I don't know what it was with this coffee.  Therefore, I warrant that my review may be virtually worthless.  I struggled to find a way to write it such that I could impart some information; the best that I can impart is:  Try it for yourself.  Look at other reviews.  See mine as only one opinion; but honestly -- I really didn't enjoy this coffee very much.<br /><br />So I wouldn't exactly recommend it -- but it deserves a fair shake.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.

I had to add extra cream to cut the bitterness, and don't think I could ever drink this black.  For those coffee drinkers who like a very dark roast, this may be just the coffee for you, but for myself, I believe I will pass on this one.  Puroast Low Acid Coffee is a really great concept, just not for this coffee drinker.

review/text: I don't really fit the presumed target audience, i.e., those with medical conditions that require low-acid diets. But, I dislike the sour taste of coffees with higher acidity, so I tried this with high hopes.<br /><br />It brews up a little strong (I used my preferred ratio). The taste was unspectacular, which isn't to say it was bad. It tasted like the diner coffee I used to love back when true diners were more prevalent. No toasty/nutty flavors. No complex aromas. Just honest coffee.<br /><br />So, I was not disappointed, but I wasn't impressed. For the price, I'll stick to Cafe Altura. I haven't tested the pH, but Altura is rich, strong, smooth, and best of all, consistently NOT sour.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Give it a shot, but temper your expectations.

It wasn't unpalatable by any means, it was just sort of ho-hum.<br /><br />This might be worth a try if you have serious issues with reflux or acid in your diet.

I get acid reflux from things like ketchup and sometimes from lattes and soda, so I picked this product primarily based on health rather than previous opinion of taste.<br /><br />this does taste like old world coffee which is a bit hard to describe. Its not bold, but it is very dark and has a mild taste. Its old-diner style quality, which I enjoyed even though I have been used to very bold flavorings such as the ones in Starbucks. I did jack up sugar like no tomorrow just a tiny bit.<br /><br />It did NOT affect my acid reflux, however, so I recommend this if you are like me and have to take medication for acid reflux, since people who suffer from acid reflux really shouldn't be drinking regular coffee as it can upset the PH levels in the stomach and aggravate the acidity in your stomach.

review/summary: Low acid but lacks flavor
review/text: Normally, if it's got the word "gourmet" in it, my back stiffens up. It's a label often slapped onto an over priced product to attract the those that will eat/drink anything with the word on "gourmet" because they think it makes them look cool and hip. And it usually doesn't taste what I would consider "gourmet." So, I confess, I started reviewing this with a bias against it - high price and labeled "gourmet".<br /><br />With only a "one pot" sample to work with, I didn't have a chance to try differing brewing methods. I went with my typical coffee making method, drip brew. It smelled nice, looked pretty dark. The taste is very hard to explain. While it has a full flavor, that flavor is of...weak coffee. I thought I'd botched the brew, but when I compared the color and opacity against my normal stuff, the Puroast looked identical. It just tasted like the same near see through stuff one gets at a greasy spoon restaurant, gas station,IHOP, etc. While not vile, it wasn't for me. I prefer a darker, richer taste.<br /><br />That being said, the big deal about Puroast is that it's low acid. That I will say I definitely noticed. Not even a hint of tummy twisting, even though I intentionally drank it on an empty stomach. For those that have problems with acid, and don't mind (or maybe even like) the taste of weak coffee, it's worth a try at least. Given the price, I'd suggest you get as little as possible to try though.

review/summary: Sorry it's ewwwwww
review/text: I do get bouts with reflux, and try to cut back on things like coffee, chocolate, mint, and other things that they say accentuates it, but this coffee doesn't taste very good. Kind of metallic.<br /><br />We made it with filtered water in the same coffee maker we use for our regular brands, and it was just ewwww. Sorry to the folks who make this but it just wasn't there for me.<br /><br />I like New Orleans coffee because when they add chicory, you get robust flavor with less caffeine and acid because you don't need as much to be satisfied. You can also buy chicory and add it to standard coffee. My favorite of the standard brands is still Folgers.<br /><br />Mrs. Olson was right. Mountain grown is the richest coffee.

review/summary: A Decent Average Coffee
review/text: I love coffee but don't drink it that often because my body reacts badly to the acidity. So I was really wanting this coffee to be "the one."<br /><br />I invited 3 friends over to help me try it. The consensus was that Dan found it a little weak, Harry could really tell there was less acid in it and Gayle gave it 5 stars because it didn't "bowl her over" with harsh flavor.<br /><br />As for me, I loved the smoothness of the brew best of all. I did find it on the weak side after the initial velvety taste went over the tongue. The flavor was rather bland. There was no over-all deep, full-bodied taste, but with the beans adjusted to exclude acidity, I didn't think there would be.<br /><br />I would drink it again, but probably wouldn't buy it. As the title says:  A Decent Average Coffee

review/summary: Just okay
review/text: I admit I am not a coffee expert by any means.  Basically, if it is brown, hot, and has cream and sugar I can drink it.  Usually.  That being said, the Puroast Low Acid Coffee French Roast was okay -- the taste to me was very strong and I am thankful that I didn't use the entire packet for the pot of coffee I made.  I would have never been able to drink it it was so strong.  That's the part where I am unsure of -- I am definitely not a fan of strong coffee.  The fact that it is titled as "low acid" didn't meant very much to me but I didn't have heartburn.  But I usually don't when drinking coffee.<br /><br />The price of this coffee alone would deter me from impulse buying or even buying it to try.  It comes in a pack of ten for twenty-four dollars and even if I only used half a packet, that would still only give me enough coffee for less than a month.  Similar tasting coffees are out in the market today that cost tons cheaper.<br /><br />Natalie S.

review/summary: Awful
review/text: French Roast coffee is naturally lower acid as a function of the roasting process. This coffee is lower acid still.  Unfortunately, the taste was well beyond atrocious.  I made the sad mistake of musing this in a French press the way I make my normal cup of coffee and the resulting cup was completely unpalatable.  Maybe in a drip, with sugar and cream it could be drinkable, but with all those additions what's the point of low acid?

review/summary: Puroast Low Acid Coffee
review/text: I have tried many coffees, but never a low acid one.  Wasn't sure what to expect.  The aroma of the coffee after brewing was fine, but I felt that it tasted strong like a certain brand from Seattle.  And I don't like their coffee. For a dark French roast it tasted burnt to me.  On the other hand, my wife enjoyed it (and she is big fan of DD coffee).  I guess it goes to what each individual's taste is but to me this wasn't my cup of tea (pun intended).

review/summary: Decent flavor, not outstanding
review/text: I'll give you three different thoughts on this coffee:<br /><br />1. As a coffee: it's not the world's best cup of coffee. If you're not dealing with the acid issues, you won't find this worth getting for the flavor. The package I had was not bad. It was ok. When I brew coffee, though, I'm looking for a little better than ok.<br /><br />2. As a value: I'm not sure this is good in terms of value. First of all, I typically make coffee in a 4-cup mini brewer, so I only need about half the package size here. Second, most of the time the extra packaging for single-serve raises the cost a little bit. So, it's not a real good value.<br /><br />3. As coffee for someone with heartburn: Here's the kicker: Puroast doesn't claim it's the best coffee in the world. It claims to be a coffee that is processed in a way to reduce acid effects from drinking it. To my senses, it does just that. (They claim to have published research that supports it, so trace their links for science.) Usually I don't drink coffee in the evenings because the acid feel just churns through the night. Not so with the Puroast. It performed for me just as advertised.<br /><br />So: the flavor's not exceptional, but that's what sugar, flavored creamers, or other add-ins can help address. The value's not great, but it is cheaper than a trip to Starbucks. And if you can't have the full-acid of a normal coffee, this one is worth a try.

review/summary: Low Acid and Little Taste
review/text: In order to taste test this coffee, I used the sample to make a pot.  I used freshly filtered water and a Melitta drip cone with a Melitta filter.  I invited two other coffee lovers to join me in trying the brewed coffee.  Each of us agreed that this dark roast coffee was mild, did have the "bitter" taste that one associates with dark roast coffee, but was weak in flavor.  Whether or not that is a result of removing the acid, I can only leave to the chemists to decide.  For one who needs to avoid acid, I believe this is a good choice.  But, if you really love the flavor of good coffee, then you may want to consider other options.

review/summary: An Adequate Cup of Coffee
review/text: Let me begin by explaining where my palate is coming from. My usual coffee is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y2QTTI">Community Coffee Ground Coffee, French Roast, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>. I'd actually prefer to drink <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5O4G">Starbucks French Roast Coffee (Extra Bold), Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>, but I just can't afford it. So, I like French roast, which has a darker, bolder flavor, and I thought I'd give this coffee a try.<br /><br />I would rate the flavor of this coffee as middling. It didn't have that paint-thinner flavor that cheap coffees have (I'm looking at you Folgers). But it also didn't have the depth and richness that I associate with high-quality French roasts. Not a lot of body in this coffee (body is that heaviness on the tongue). Most French roasts have much more body, but some people might prefer this coffee because it has less. Taste-wise, this coffee is also fairly low in acidity (which you would expect from the brand), but low acidity is characteristic of most French roasts. I don't know how much easier this will be on the sensitive stomach.<br /><br />My guess is that if your stomach has serious acid problems, then this coffee will still be too much for it. If you just get a little sour stomach, you might be able to handle some other brands, and trial and error should lead you to the right one. I hesitate to recommend this coffee because of the price. You're paying a premium price for a middling flavor. I think most people  with acid sensitivity should be able to find a better coffee they can stomach for the same price or a much cheaper option with the same flavor. But, if you try this coffee and it works for you, enjoy. It's not a bad coffee; I just didn't find its flavor outstanding.

review/summary: Nice if your stomach needs the low acidity
review/text: I have occasional problems with heartburn, so when I saw that Puroast had released a coffee specially designed to be low acid, I was eager to try it, and I enlisted my husband as a willing co-investigator.  Our verdict:  The coffee does indeed have a noticeably smoother, less acidy taste.  That's the good part.  However, I would characterize the taste--and I'm trying to be diplomatic here--as reminiscent of a slightly old coffee foil pack found in a three star hotel.  I'll admit to being somewhat of a Starbucks addict, and I don't think the Puroast will convince me to change.  However, I think it would be a good option to have on hand for times when my stomach is acting up but I still need my morning caffeine fix, and if my stomach forced me to where I had to choose between the Puroast low acid coffee or no coffee at all, I'd gratefully drink the Puroast.

review/text: I cannot say I had high expectations for a low-acid French roast coffee.  It was rather bland so the flavor does not live up to the full-bodied flavor one would expect from a dark roast coffee.  It is not bad an certainly an alternative if you are susceptible to acid but it is not in competition for any premium coffee awards.

review/summary: Definitely strong but with less acid
review/text: One thing great about America is a lot of choices. One thing bad about America is a lot of choices.  How many different kinds of coffee do we need?  Now I have to make another decision when really I just want to enjoy a nice cup of coffee in the morning; should it be decaf or regular, brewed or instant?  Some of these choices are easy, for example, instant is never a substitute for brewed coffee, Starbucks is better than the vending machine at work...These choices I can make in a second.  Now I need to decide about the acid in my coffee!<br /><br />I first discovered that coffee had a fairly high acid content  when I inadvertently drank a really old cup of coffee at a gas station.  I think I also discovered acid indigestion!  I also realize that many people have an acid intolerance from a medical standpoint, therefore low acid coffee is a good idea.  Is it good coffee?  This package was a French Dark Roast which I felt was extremely flavorful, in fact after the first few cups I was actually making the coffee somewhat weaker to suit my taste. In no way did the low acid impact a full bodied flavor.<br /><br />I recommend the coffee regarding flavor, however I suggest reviewing the coffee on Puroaast's website to discover the real ingredients and acid percentages.  The package seem to give no details except for the statement "Now you can drink coffee again".

review/text: I am not coffee connoisseur, but I love lattes and coffee in general. I usually drink instant coffee, but recently realized that it tastes sour/acidy. For some people making a coffee is a ritual and they probably will think I'm a heretic (like my friend from Ethiopia is always shaking head when I show up with Starbucks in my hand- I'm from Central Europe and shake my head when someone makes mashed potatoes out from the box-desecration of potatoes;)<br /><br />To try Puroast low acid coffee I poured hot water over 2 big teaspoons of Puroast coffee, add some powdered coffee creamer and it was tasty! Of course the coffee grounds are annoying, but there was no acid outcome.<br />I guess now I will try to find low acid instant coffee or maybe will finally buy small coffee maker (I'm the only coffee drinker in my house).

review/summary: Unpalatable!
review/text: I generally don't have a very discerning palate when it comes to coffee. Almost any coffee becomes drinkable with enough flavored creamer. So when I made Puroast Low Acid Coffee, I wanted to have a second opinion. I made it for my roommate, whose time in the Pacific Northwest turned her into a bit of a coffee snob.<br /><br />First, I opened the package and smelled the coffee. It had the aroma of one of those motel room brews--the kind that aren't fabulous but will do the trick when you need some caffeine. Then I made the coffee in my Gevalia coffee maker. I sampled it black to get the true flavor. That flavor was ... burned. Even after adding a generous amount of liquid creamer, the coffee still tasted burned. Next, I gave some to my roommate. She put some half and half in hers, and she could barely choke it down. The coffee was completely unpalatable, and we dumped the rest of the pot down the drain.<br /><br />While I like the idea of a low acid coffee, I cannot recommend this brand.

review/summary: No more antacids after drinking this coffee
review/text: To be honest, I do prefer some other brands of coffee, if only they didn't affect my stomach and intestinal tract so badly. That is why I was excited to try Puroast. It has a perfectly fine flavor. It also has the added benefit of being low acid, at least if my heartburn - or lack of it - is any indicator of that. I used to be in denial, remembering college days when I practically survived on coffee...and pizza. But I've bowed to reality, after far too many years of thinking the heartburn would eventually go away - permanently.<br /><br />Coffee is the one thing that gives me heartburn...not spicy foods, not anything else. Now I can have my coffee and ditch the antacids when I drink Puroast. So I figure this is a win-win situation. I'm saving money on antacids and enjoying my coffee at the same time.<br /><br />Having noted that, I know people can be very selective when choosing a favorite coffee. So this may not be to your taste but it certainly hit the spot with me. Give it a try and - if you have time -  give a shout out about whether you like it or not.<br /><br />I also have to confess that I'll probably have some weak moments and drink regular coffee when I don't have the Puroast close at hand. But I'm hoping I'll cut down on my antacid use by at least half or more. I know I'd be able to give up those antacids completely if I drank only decaf but then I'd be walking around in a sleepy state much of the time. Compromises, compromises.

review/summary: If all you want is low acid, try other beverages. With Data.
review/text: Puroast Low Acid Coffee<br />If all you want is low acid, try other beverages. With Data.<br />To start with I do experience occasional heartburn, reflux, etc, so this was a very exciting taste test. I brewed a pot of fairly well renowned regular coffee, and a pot of Puroast. I poured both into identical cups, no milk or sugar to start with. The regular coffee had a deep brown color, while the Puroast had a black brown color. I tested the pH of both, the regular was about 5-5.5 while the Puroast was indeed 7.0 or neutral as claimed. First taste was of the Puroast as I did not want to be prejudiced by the regular taste. Good grief... It was wet, it was warm, very flat taste with no finish, hardly what I would call even an average cup of coffee. The best comparison is that to a day old coffee that has been left to evaporate and oxidize. Perhaps burned charcoal aroma with hints of bitter chocolate and caramel? The standard coffee by comparison had a rich coffee aroma, and the taste was wonderfully balanced coffee bean with tinge of vanilla, and a pleasant finish with a slight kick (the balance finish kick is unfortunately from the acid).<br /><br />I now added some whole milk, and as expected the regular coffee mellowed out a bit, but all of the wonderful flavor still came across. Incredibly when I added milk to the Puroast, it turned a poor tasting cup into an awful tasting cup. The flavor now became that of  mostly spoiled milk! This was such a strange sensation that I had three more people confirm the sour milk phenomenon. To top things of, the color had now become that of black brown mud.<br /><br />So all in all, this was a bad experience. If you have a need to drink a low acid coffee do this. Get yourself your favorite cup of coffee and a bottle of antacid instead.

review/text: Normally I wouldn't buy French Roast because it's too strong of a flavor for me. But because this was a low acid coffee, I wasn't as concerned. I don't suffer from heartburn, acid reflux or mild stomach irritation, but I enjoy decaf coffee the majority of the time. This coffee looked fine, but it didn't smell good. To me, the smell of the coffee brewing is almost as good as drinking it. There just wasn't much of an aroma while brewing or after pouring in the cup. I added cream and the taste was ok. The aftertaste stayed with me long after drinking the coffee. I'll stick with decaf.

review/summary: Like watered down & weak Turkish coffee
review/text: I drink my coffee strong.  The 3 ounce sample I received of this product wasn't nearly enough quantity for me to give it a real taste test, as I use twice that amount of coffee to make my morning brew.  Keep that in mind if you also drink your coffee strong: the 3 ounce packets are small.<br /><br />I am a Folgers fan.  It has a full-bodied flavor that is rich and satisfying to me.  So I am comparing Puroast Low Acid Coffee to Folgers, and the Puroast Low Acid Coffee failed miserably.  I found Puroast coffee thin and weak with some bitterness.  There is a mild espresso flavor that is similar to Turkish coffee I have had.  Bitter and unpleasant, but weak at the same time.<br /><br />I have had acid reflux (GERD) in the past and drinking regular coffee does exacerbate the condition.  This low acid coffee is made for people with acid reflux conditions so severe that they have had to stop drinking their morning coffee, and I applaud the fact that any coffee company has addressed the issue.  At the same time, the price is prohibitive.  10 tiny 3 ounce bags for $24?  If you make one pot every morning, that $72 a month!  For that cost, I would suggest buying acid reducer pills, and taking one before you drink your morning coffee, and to try to eat something bland while drinking your coffee, to give your stomach something to do with all the acid it is creating.<br /><br />Or, if you only have acid reflux in the morning and you think it's the coffee you are drinking, be aware that it could be caused by some medications you are taking, like calcium or vitamin pills.  In fact, any large pill can sit in your stomach and cause your stomach to create a lot of acid trying to break it down.  A recommendation is to either take more frequent smaller doses of the vitamin supplement, or stop them all together and cut out the acid reflux entirely.  Or add acid reducer medication and put up with it.<br /><br />Two or three sips of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and it's down the drain.  It's giving me acid reflux just talking about it.

review/summary: Weak Aroma And Taste, Just OK
review/text: I obtained a sample and when I opened the package the aroma was not inviting at all.  Well, I brewed it up anyway on a regular Cuisinart coffee maker and used the sample bag with enough water for 2-3 cups to make a stronger cup of coffee. Nevertheless, it tasted weak to me and didn't smell any better after brewing it. It was drinkable and ok, just not very satisfying to me as it didn't have a richness or depth or good aroma to it. Admittedly, I am not a big French Roast fan as it tends to taste bitter to me and acidic.  This one may be better than other French Roast because while I thought it tasted weak and bitter it presumably is lower acid. If you need a low acid coffee, then this is okay, but if not you may not find this satisfying, especially if you like dark, full flavored strong coffee.

review/summary: Low Acid Coffee
review/text: Puroast Low Acid Coffee Low Acid Coffee French Roast, 3-Ounce Bags<br /><br />  I suffer from acid reflux and heartburn after eating and drinking certain foods.  I have always loved coffee but I just could not handle the heartburn and other stomach problems after drinking coffee. I was so excited to see this available because I would love to start drinking coffee again on a more regular basis.<br /><br />I have a 12 pot coffee maker and I only used 10 cups to brew for this pot of coffee and it was too potent for me. The aroma is wonderful but with 3ozs of coffee I needed to add more water. After adding additional water to the pot I found that it was drinkable for me. There is a mouthful of flavor in every sip with absolutely no aftertaste. No major coffee breath!<br />French roast has a naturally burnt/smokey taste to begin with and in this coffee you can really taste it. I just think I prefer a different roast type.<br />  As far as the low acidity I was really happy about not having to suffer after a cup or several cups of coffee. Since this coffee comes in different roasts and flavors, I would seriously consider buying it to alleviate the negative side effects from drinking regular coffee.

review/summary: Definitely low acid, but slightly low on flavor too
review/text: First off, I am a Dunkin Donuts coffee guy.  I like it the best out of major brands, either from the local franchise (cream and sugar) or made at home (black).  Dunkin Donuts' coffee is not for everyone, as it has a heavily roasted taste.  At work, we purchase Starbucks Sumatra from the local coffee delivery distributor (it's actually cheaper than DD or other brands!).  Starbucks House Blend used to be what we bought, but everyone in the office (myself included) felt it was one of the most acidic coffees to drink.  Their Sumatra is stronger but less acidic.  I'm no coffee expert, but the last couple years has definitely opened my eyes to the nuances of coffee flavor.  With that experience, I was interested to try this product.<br /><br />The flavor, off the bat, is certainly less acidic.  I drank it black, as I don't typically add anything to my coffee.  It has a fuller coffee taste than many decafs I've tried, but there is a bit of a dull taste to it.  I made it at home, and have a very clean coffee maker, but it was just a little off.  I prefer it to Dunkin decaf, but not by much.  If you require a non-decaf coffee with low acid, this is a fine choice.  It may improve with sugar or creamer too.  There may be better choices out there for this type of product, or coffees which are full flavor but less acidic.  I am not extremely sensitive to the acid content in coffee, but if you are, this should be a good choice for you.

review/text: I normally drink Foldger's (sp) coffee and not much of that.  My regular coffee is definately strong in the acid department, at least for me.<br /><br />This coffee has no acid as far as I am concerned.  It had no acid aftertaste and did not impact my stomach at all.  As far as the taste I liked it less than my normal coffee.  It is stronger than Foldger's  (sp).  I would have given the coffee another star but my wife couldn't stand the taste so I figured it had to come down at least one star because of her complete disapproval.<br /><br />So I give this coffee 3 stars overall and 5 stars for lack of acid problems.<br /><br />AD2

review/summary: Low acid?  Doubtful.  Taste?  Aweful
review/text: I like the aroma and flavor of coffee but many brands, particularly the big "S" brand, do a job on my stomach.  I was anxious to try Puroast low acid coffee.  I prepared it in a drip coffeemaker.  I was highly disappointed with the brewed coffee.  I don't use sugar in my coffee but this definitely needed it.  The taste and aroma were awful.  It has a burnt flavor, even for a French roast and extremely bitter aftertaste.  The aroma was not particularly inviting either.<br /><br />I wish I still had my PH meter because I would have loved to test the acidity of this coffee vs. regular coffee.  Based on the bitter aftertaste and how it reacted on my stomach, I'd guess it is anything but low acid but I have no scientific means to validate my subjective opinion.  Frankly, even if it is low acid, I can't "stomach" the taste.

review/summary: Unpalatable
review/text: I love coffee. I love the scent of it when it brews. I love the taste with a bit of cream and some sweetener. I love it and I drink a lot of it. I've tasted everything from high dollar gourmet blends to cheap supermarket standards just to see which I prefer the most. I'm sometimes as finicky about my coffee as a wine connoisseur is about a robust pinot noir.<br /><br />That's why, when I brewed a pot of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and tested it, I had to get a second opinion. I hated it. It was horrible on every level. The scent of the grounds as I was preparing the pot was my first clue: not only did they not smell like any coffee I've ever smelled, but the scent was almost a burned rubber odor that, when brewing, permeated the house like day old stink.<br /><br />And then there was the taste.<br /><br />I can't speak to whether or not it does what it's purported to do - ease the sensitive stomachs of those for whom normal coffee is too acidic (which occasionally includes me, especially when I drink a cup at night). I can't speak on that because there was no way, after four or five mouthfuls, I was going to force myself to drink any more to find out. Call me crazy, but I sort of expected the coffee, low acid French Roast or not, to taste like coffee. Not like soaked sweat socks poured over radial tires. It may very well be low acid, but the aftertaste alone makes heartburn preferable.<br /><br />But I know that I'm finicky about coffee, so before I became too hasty in my rush to judgement, I secured a second opinion from my father. My father who loves coffee even more than I, but unlike myself, has never met a cup he couldn't drink, and thinks that drinking the two day old swill at the bottom of a scorched pot is better than wasting it to brew fresh. He drinks it black, likes it strong, and has been known to tolerate even my aunt's coffee...and that, for anyone who's tried it, is saying something.<br /><br />So when he poured himself a cup of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and settled in his chair, I watched him for his reaction, expecting him to razz me for my persnickety tastes. He drank half a cup, got up, and poured the rest of the cup and the whole of the remaining pot down the drain.<br /><br />That pretty much says it all.

review/summary: Seriously Foul Coffee
review/text: I'm not picky about coffee. I'll drink just about any dreck that's been sitting in a pot, mug or carafe for a day or two. Just heat it up and serve me. Normally, I use a one-cup instant bag with boiling water and I get a fairly decent cup of coffee from Folgers using theirs or any store knock-off.<br /><br />Those taste like gourmet compared, and are certainly much better than the "coffee" I made this morning from Puroast's French Roast 3-ounce bag.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have stated it tastes like gas, ashes, fuel and I agree. Add to those descriptions a hint of motor oil, old basement and a sprinkle of dog dander.<br /><br />I opened the container and was greeted with an ashy, somewhat mildew-like odor. Oh well, keep going, I say. I boiled water and let a bag steep in the pot for a while as I don't like drip. I feel you get a much better full flavor from steeping. It took a while for the dark color to appear, but soon it looked very coffee-like and I put some in a mug. I smelled it first, noticing that it lacked a standard coffee scent. Then I tasted it with exactly the result I was expecting, a decidedly un-coffee flavor. Stale, with a hint of dried leaves? That's the best I can come up with. So, I added sweetener (stevia) and my usual cream (vanilla soy milk). It still tasted nothing like real coffee to me.<br /><br />I didn't give the mug a chance to comfort my stomach, poured it out and made a regular cup of joe that I could drink. Seriously, this is simply not a good product in my estimation. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I guess in a dire emergency this drink could possibly give you enough caffeine to limp, crawl or otherwise slither out to a store to buy actual coffee or at least be served something warm by the Red Cross.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: This tea is amazingly tasty white tea. For most people they may not know what white tea taste like. Where black tea has the acidic taste of coffee and green tea has a very earth/leafy taste, white tea comes in as you would expect for its color. It is very light tasting with almost a lightly sweet maltiness to it. It doesn't have any of the harshness that you could find in black tea or coffee. And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you. If you want to try white tea, this is the product for you.<br />I purchased the organic version before I purchased this one. I saw this one was cheaper so I gave it a try, and I couldn't readily notice any difference. I ended up just mixing the two boxes together and will continue to buy the non-organic in the future as long as it is the cheaper of the two.

review/summary: First Rate Blend.
review/text: I really enjoy coffee, and I have ever since my teenage years. My tastes have gradually evolved and escalated. The first to go was any kind of instant coffee. How anyone could drink that swill is beyond me. Next to go was any kind of additive, such as cream or sugar. The next to go was any kind of ground coffee in a can. Some is marginally OK, but compared to whole-bean coffee, it just doesn't cut it. No, whole-bean coffee without any additives and ground on the spot is the only coffee I'll drink, short of some kind of emergency.<br /><br />When It comes to whole-bean coffees, there's quite an amazing variety. I found Trader Joe's to have an excellent selection from all over the world, and the cost (on a per pound basis) was typically about 50% that of what you might expect to pay in the local super market. I particularly liked their Columbian Supremo. The problem is, the local Trader Joe"s is a long way off and I sometimes run out between visits. Well, I've then picked up some large bags of beans, one of which was Starbucks French Roast, at my local Costco store and it was quite excellent. Starbucks is first rate, but tends to be somewhat pricey, even when purchased at Costco.<br /><br />Well, one day I discovered the Kirkland Signature House Blend bags of whole-bean coffee at Costco. In my opinion, Kirkland Signature products have always been of the highest quality but at a substantially reduced price. For example, this Kirkland coffee is almost half the cost (on a per pound basis) of Starbucks French Roast. But, right on the front of the Kirkland package it says "Roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co." Hmmmm. I just had to try this one. Well, it's excellent. It's a little less robust than my Starbucks French Roast, but I prefer it that way. I'd say it's first rate coffee at a bargain basement price. Buying whole-bean coffee at the local supermarket is now out of the question.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: I think this coffe has changed recently
review/text: We used to drink this all the time. It was a great coffee. But recently we noticed that the formula has changed. Something has changed, because both my wife and started noticing that the taste was different and it always tastes a little weak now. We've tried a few different brands lately, and sure enough, something about that Kirkland coffee is different than before, and we just don't care for it. I wonder what changed?

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: Discovered this coffee at Costco. I had a hard time finding a coffee with lots of flavour. Wonderful coffee but a RESEALABLE BAG would be an improvement.

review/summary: This is some GREAT coffee!
review/text: I purchased this at my local Costco (I'm still a little unsure as to how Amazon carries Kirkland brand?).  It was much cheaper (less than ten bucks), but it is some DARN good coffee!  It is mild, smooth, and has an amazing flavor.  I was a little "iffy" on it when I first picked it up, but you surely won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Prefect for Jura expresso machine
review/text: I have a Jura Capresso automatic espresso machine.  I like it, but I have found it difficult to find beans that make expresso that takes much like what you might get at a Starbucks.  The beans have to be very robust, but they can't be French or Italian roasted because that makes them too oily (which can clog the machine).  I've tried lots and lots of different beans, some quite expensive (like more than $20 / lb.).  I saw these at Costco and decided to give them a try.  They are perfect.  The flavor is great, and the roast is pretty dry so they work beautifully in my machine.

review/summary: Excellent coffee, excellent price.
review/text: The beans are medium roasted, not too bitter or too light. The brew comes out with a nice kick to it, and only once or twice has it tasted burnt. I'm actually drinking it right now: the aroma is quite strong, the coffee is full-bodied, rich, and goes down nicely. The beans by themselves are also quite tasty.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good brew at a good price.

review/summary: A pleasant surprise!
review/text: I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this and was surprised to find a bag of fresh, oily, and fragrant beans.  Since this is one of the more affordable Costco coffees, I really wasn't expecting this to trump my favourite brands!<br />I'm getting a much richer and smoother coffee than I was with pre-ground, vacuum sealed grounds, and beans from any other brand I've tried.<br />Now I can make equal, if not better coffee than I can drink at coffeehouses!  Unlike some other reviewers I am having no trouble producing a strong, rich espresso from these beans.

review/summary: GREAT STUFF
review/text: I'm not a coffee snob, but for the price you can't find better coffee anywhere else. After drinking this for over a year I can't even begin to imagine drinking folgers or some other cheap coffee. High grade beans at a low grade price.

review/summary: Kirkland Decaf whole bean coffee
review/text: This coffee is the best decaf coffee you will ever taste. We finally found this coffee after trying dozens of other decaf coffees and it is so rich and flavorful that you wouldn't know that it a decaf coffee.

review/summary: kirkland signature house blend bean coffee
review/text: This coffee is ok for the price.  Better than most supermarket brands.  Similar to Starbuck's House Blend.  I prefer a little richer, darker brew than this, but I think the quality is fine.  No "off" flavors that I detected.  I forgot to add that it seems to me to be low acid.  This is a large bag I ordered and I left the whole bag out on the counter and used it from there, but it got a little stale before I used it all.  I would suggest just taking out a bit at a time and storing the balance.

review/summary: Slightly burnt, but not horrible.
review/text: Maybe they just had the roaster a little too hot that day, but our beans were slightly burnt. That being said, I can see (taste) the blend's potential. I'm no connoisseur, but I have my preferences. This blend was ok...not good, not great, just okay.

review/summary: Not a lot of taste
review/text: Am a recent burr grinder user and have tried a few different beans and this one lacks flavor or body, something's missing.  Had the Kirkland Columbia coffee and that was better but still looking for a really good coffee to brew and this isn't the one.  As one other recent reviewer noted, this just seems weak, not much taste.

review/summary: Promising Aroma, but Disappointing Coffee.
review/text: I enjoy whole-roasted coffee beans. Once you grind your own coffee you just can never go back to coffee in a can, or certainly not instant coffee. Well, whole bean coffees are expensive in a grocery store or supermarket. I've discovered a lower-cost alternative. I pick up two or three pound containers at Trader Joe's or Costco. The Costco source is particularly interesting in that they always seem to have two or three different kinds, but the kinds seem to change on every other visit. Over the years, I've had coffees from all over the world. This latest time there was a pallet of Kirkland Signature Dark Roast Espresso Blend (with a little tag that said roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co.) The aroma around the display was excellent and I couldn't resist.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the rich aroma was almost overwhelming. My wife even loved it and she isn't a coffee drinker. The coffee itself isn't all that impressive. It has a good light tasty flavor that seems mild and slightly sweet and goes down quite easily. I'd have to guess that the caffeine content was not up to the level I was used to in other whole-bean coffees and it doesn't provide that good morning jolt. I was expecting something richer and more robust, more like a dark roast. Well, this is a nice coffee, but if you're looking for something that will grow hair on your chest, this is not the one. It has a good flavor, but it's weak. I'll have no trouble finishing the bag, but I'm disappointed. The aroma was so promising and the coffee just wasn't up to it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
