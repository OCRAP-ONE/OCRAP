review/summary: Roasty Taste But Too Weak
review/text: To be fair, I like the roasty taste of this tea. However, it really isn't as strong as I like it to be. I had to use 3 teabags to get the strength of (what I usually get for) 1 teabag. Which makes this product quite expensive.

review/text: This is the only tea bags we get here in America, tastes like original Pakistani tea. You have to brew it correctly. We throw in 2 teabags per cup into the tea pot, and boil the water inside with the tea bags, then when its boiled, leave it on low heat for 2-5 minutes, and pour, and serve with milk and sugar. Taste fantastic. We've tried lipton, and countless others from from the local grocery store, this came out on top of the favorites list. U wont be disappointed.

review/summary: Makes a fantastic Caramel Matcha Latte!
review/text: I have always been a lover of all things caramel. I've probably tried every caramel cookie, cake, ice cream, tea, coffee, pastry, and countless other items that contain caramel. But I am very picky about caramel flavorings. Many of them taste too artificial, butterscotch-y, or are just too faint for me to enjoy. Happily, this Caramel Matcha did not disappoint me. When I received the package in the mail, I immediately knew my Matcha had arrived. There was a wonderful, strong smell of candy-like caramel coming from the package. After actually opening the package and smelling more caramel goodness, I knew I was in for a treat.<br /><br />I decided to try this as a latte. So I prepared it using my usual method of 2 grams Matcha, 2 ounces of skim milk, 3-4 scoops of stevia, and 6 ounces of water. I whisked this up using my electric milk frother and tried it. It was very good, but a little strong. After adding another 2 ounces of water, it was close to perfection. This Matcha is very smooth and rich. Even though I used very little milk, it tasted so creamy. The caramel flavor is just right - enough flavor that you can definitely taste it, but not enough to outshine the flavor of the Matcha. This may be one of the best drinks I've ever made at home, and I'm actually kind of proud.

review/summary: Awesome flavor!
review/text: The flavoring is absolutely caramel.  No doubt about it.  It smells so rich and sweet you'd expect to get a sugar shock from drinking it, but it's only as sweet as the natural sweetness of a good matcha.  And the matcha base used is good!  The flavor isn't just some mask for an inferior tea!<br /><br />The color of this tea is a bit brownish.  Those who are used to the vibrant green of matcha may be a bit shocked at first, but the brownish tint is undoubtedly from the flavoring.  The awesome awesome flavoring.  Drink it straight for a decadent treat without the cavaties, or make it into a mind blowing latte.  yummy!  You can use it to add caramel flavor to anything!  caramel vanilla matcha milkshake?  Yes please!  Caramel matcha hot chocolate?  Mmmmm...no words.

review/summary: Matcha meets candy.
review/text: This matcha is awesome. I am a caramel addict, so sometimes I'll get something caramel flavored without really thinking about it, which was the case with this tea. But really, the flavors work really well together.<br /><br />The flavor almost reminds me of what I'd imagine green tea creme brulee would taste like. It's got the obvious green tea taste from the matcha itself, but then there's the sweet, creamy notes from the caramel. It's okay when it's hot and by itself, but I think it's vastly improved when it's made as an iced matcha latte. No sugar necessary there.<br /><br />Beyond drinking it, this seems like it would make an excellent flavor for cakes and ice cream. I am definitely going to give it a try in ice cream in the summer.

review/summary: Oh My Matcha
review/text: So in my search for the perfect vanilla (which I've now found in Red Leaf Tea's French Vanilla matcha), I've found that many caramel teas are close enough to temporarily satisfy me. But after a while I miss that vanilla creaminess and begin the hunt anew. Plus, caramel is my favorite sweet candy, though I prefer sour candies. But as a child who went through two sets of braces, caramel was not a treat I was allowed to indulge in often. But every Halloween I would buy a bag of those Caramel Apple suckers, braces be damned, and make them last for ages. My love affair with caramel has been a long and torrid one.<br /><br />Anyway, caramel brings out those feel-good feeling in me. So of course when I was ordering my Green Apple matcha from Red Leaf Teas, the caramel had to tumble into my cart too! I have to try them mixed, or I'll be doing my teenage self a grave disservice. But first, I'm going to try it by itself, with sugar added, of course. If it's anything like their French Vanilla, I'm in for a treat. I'm trying to try all of the new ones, but all I want to do is return to that little gem.<br /><br />On to the caramel! I'm only making a small cup of this as it is 9:30 at night and I want to sleep at some point. But hey, sleep is for the weak and matcha-less, right? Right. The smell is amazing. Like I just want to crawl into the package and spend the rest of forever there. The taste...mmm. Mmmmm....mmmm. Okay, it tastes like....mmmm. Maybe I needed a bigger cup. A soup bowl, perhaps. Guh...mmmm. It tastes like the French Vanilla, but with a lovely burnt sugar aftertaste that is rocking my world right now. It tastes like real caramel made on the stovetop with nothing but sugar, cream, and a big mess that is completely worth it. Mmmmm. When I was in high school, at a church carnival I won a caramel cake. It was a caramel-flavored cake that was laced with real caramel bits, caramel icing and drizzled with, you guessed it, caramel. This reminds me of that. Or the caramel pie from O'Charley's, which was essentially a pie crust filled with caramel. This is amazing, and I want to order some with the "There's matcha in this?" flavoring option so I can just drown in the caramelly goodness. This is a must-always-have-in-stock for me.

review/summary: Great Flavour!
review/text: I bought the caramel matcha more or less on a whim - it was on sale, so I could get a bigger size! Thinking back, I'm really glad I did. I am much more of a chocolate or vanilla person - caramel is not something that I normally lean towards. Red Leaf Tea hasn't steered me wrong yet! I am amazed at how much I like this!<br /><br />Dry, the caramel smell is strong and very distinctive. If I didn't know what flavour it was, I would have guessed correctly! In no way does it overwhelm or taste artificial though. I decided to take some to work with me, so I made it iced. It reminded me of a caramel version of chocolate milk - great flavour, creamy and all-round delicious. It was so good I even let two of my coworkers try it, and they agreed that it was heavenly.<br /><br />I find that my favourite way to have sweet flavoured matchas is as a latte or an iced latte, and I usually add a little bit of honey, depending on the specific flavour. My thermometer is currently m.i.a (I think it's at the bungalow) so I've just been letting the water get a little warm in the kettle and everything has been turning out great! I am thinking that caramel might become a staple flavour in my tea cupboard and I love having the chance to try so many wonderful flavours. I would highly recommend picking up some of this.<br /><br />I'd say that overall, this was my second favourite flavour (behind tiramisu) If you like caramel at all you should try this!

I have tried this hot, cold, somewhere in the middle, smoothie, latte..etc. Basically I've tried it all with my small 30g sample (basic grade a.k.a classic with robust flavour). I like this best hot half matcha, half milk and marshmallows! The customer service is great if you have any problems or questions just ask them :D I also ordered with the tin since the bags aren't resealable. The small tin fits very nicely into my cupboard and helps my tea take up a lot less space! I recommend this to everyone!

review/summary: Great Tasting Matcha
review/text: I am the very definition of a beginning matcha drinker: I have never once even tried matcha before, much less made it myself. But I couldn't help but order one of Red Leaf Tea's myriad of flavored matchas. This one sounded delicious!<br /><br />The minute I cut open the foil envelope of matcha I was swamped with delicious caramel scent. Smelling it a bit closer brought out a kind of fruity aroma, which I assume must just be the matcha. It kind of reminded me of a caramel apple or something like that. Following the instructions on the brochure I ended up sifting 1.5tsp in my bowl (I was unsure on the instructions whether each scoop was supposed to be 0.5-1tsp, or two scoops was that total?). My very fine sieve (yay HomeGoods) worked well, and there were definitely more clumps than it first seemed, so I'm glad I sifted. I added a few ounces of water (though I didn't measure exactly how much) at about 180�F and whisked with my metal cooking whisk vigorously. It frothed pretty well but I think my technique is lacking! Right when the water hit the matcha I smelled a much stronger green tea flavor and a distinct earthiness, but not so much caramel.<br /><br />I took a sip, but it was pretty strong and bitter so I whisked some more, added more water and whisked some more. Better. Still a little bitter, but I am chalking that up to user error. Maybe I just need to add some sugar, too, since I tend to be a bit sensative to bitterness, but I didn't have any with me. Anyway, that kind of fruity caramel came through, the flavor blooming in the sip. The green tea wasn't too vegetal or in your face like I was fearing. The caramel was not as strong as I thought it would be, but it was present (and again that might be user error), and I did finish the entire bowl pretty fast! I am excited to try this in latte form, and I'm sure I will look up all kinds of tips and tricks for matcha now. I also wanted matcha to add to smoothies and to try some baking with it, and this seems like it would be amazing for both. I just bought some brownie mix at the store, and now I am thinking maybe some caramel matcha brownies? I don't know if the flavor would be drowned out, though. Research must be done!

You will never regret it.<br /><br />So the flavor, this caramel is THE most carmaley flavored tea I have ever consumed! This is like eating chewy caramel candies without the tooth decay or chewing.

I swear to you this is THE caramel to get!<br /><br /> Get some of this matcha, mix in a splash of vanilla low fat creamer, a half cup to cup of milk, some ice cubes, pour in your matcha mix and BAM, LOVE!<br /><br />I have had many amazing flavors from Red Leaf Tea so far in my matcha journey but I will say without a doubt THIS one is THE sweetest MOST candy like, MOST true to its namesake, MOST indulgent, dessert like, not even close IT IS dessert! I could not even go down to my local ice cream store and get something THIS delicious.

review/summary: A wonderful introduction to flavoured matcha!
review/text: It took me a long time to finally place an order for some Red Leaf Tea matcha, and now that I have it in my hands (and my tummy!) I wish I had have purchased it sooner.<br /><br />I was unsure whether I would find it too much of a fuss to prepare matcha myself, or whether I would enjoy the delicious sweet grassy taste of matcha paired with rich flavourings. Matcha seemed to me more like a tea you should enjoy on its own. But honestly, let me tell you, the caramel flavour and the bright, fresh matcha make a perfect coupling. And I have found the preparation to be much easier than expected!<br /><br />I have had other plain matchas before, but they simply do not compare in flavour or quality to this caramel matcha. So far I have tried it hot with no additions, and hot with milk and sugar. I much prefer it sweetened with milk, as that cuts down on the strength of the vegetal qualities of the matcha. It also really brings out the caramel sweetness. On its own I found it a bit too strong, but I tend to like milk and sugar in most of my teas.<br /><br />Overall I'm very glad I have some of this on hand now, and I can't wait to try out some of their other flavours. I have my eye on cheesecake, cotton candy, boysenberry, french vanilla, pear, and so many others! I think I may have found a new addiction. At least it's a healthy one!

review/summary: Caramel Matcha - very tasty and easy to make!
review/text: I'd say I'm a beginner with Matchas. I've never made a straight up cup of matcha, but I've had matcha pre-mixed with genmaicha teas. One of my favourite sushi joints has "iced green tea" which is matcha iced - excellent and refreshing with sushi! However in stores, I found matcha to be quite expensive. My local tea shops sold basic matchas with no fun flavors a little out of my price range to try a new kind of tea that I'm unsure is good, fresh and packaged right. Best prices I could find was in asian super markets. I've often purchased pre-measured matcha mixes or little tubs that stated it was for ice cream and baking. These mixes were still on the expensive side, so I used them sparingly to make smoothies or add to vanilla ice cream. The matcha mixes I disliked because they contained creamers and sweeteners thus calories I could do without. The unsweetened ones I found were often bitter and occasionally tasted like dirty grass.<br /><br />I saw Red Leaf's matchas reviewed at Steepster and became interested - so many different flavors! As a crazy tea drinker with a stash of over 100, I love interesting and fun tea blends, especially ones that have chocolate, exotic fruits, or caramel. Red Leaf has a big selection of various flavors. Personally, I never saw flavored matchas until I discovered Red Leaf's site. I had to order this Caramel Matcha!<br /><br />I then realized I have no traditional matcha gear, no bamboo whisk, funky spoons or bowl to prepare my matcha. I could of purchased it along with my order, but I had a tea budget to follow. I figured for now I'll make do with a tiny wire whisk, measuring spoon and a wide tea cup.<br /><br />My package arrived in a flat envelope, the matcha in a non resealable gold bag. My package also had a pamphlet on their various matchas and how to prepare it.<br /><br />TIME TO ENJOY MATCHA!<br /><br />Smell of the matcha powder - Strong grassy green tea smell with a spark of sweetness. From sniffing the matcha bag, I got green dust on the tip of my nose!<br /><br />First Cup - The Matcha Protein Smoothie<br />Red Leaf has a collection of matcha recipes to get you started. I followed the recipe on Red Leaf's website for the Matcha Smoothie with Protein Powder.<br />I used a frozen banana, fat free plain Silk soy milk, ON 100% soy protein vanilla powder and 2tsp of the Caramel Matcha.<br /><br />The colour of my smoothie is a milky yet dark matcha green. The caramel in the matcha is smooth and perfect strength that I can imagine it being gooey yummy. The banana adds extra depth and sweetness. I did not find the smoothie bitter or in need of additional sweeteners. The matcha and banana hid the protein powder taste. With that said, I figure this large smoothie was around 270 calories and is a great post workout smoothie that has 32g of protein. I'm going to make this smoothie again next time I lift weights.<br /><br />Second Cup - The Real Deal cup of Matcha<br />Using the instructions from the website, I carefully sift 1 tsp of the caramel matcha through a fine mesh tea pot strainer - it went surprisingly well and not messy at all.<br />Annoyingly, my hot water kettle does 185F (not 180F) so I went with 175F. I poured in about 1/3 of a cup of water and whisked away with my tiny wire whisk. It took a couple minutes to get a 1cm of delicious looking matcha froth. I then added a bit more hot water to taste.<br /><br />My cup was a beautiful deep green. The Caramel matcha is delicately flavored but with a full bodied green tea taste. Not watery or bitter or nasty grassy. The caramel is a fun present at the end of my sip and lingers as an aftertaste.<br /><br />Third Cup - The Matcha latte<br />I followed the same procedure I did for the hot cup of matcha, but added 2 tsp of sugar and topped the frothy matcha with soymilk and ice cubes. The result was very magical as the sugar and cold temperature makes the caramel pop more. I discovered it is possible to drink something and drool over it at the same time! This was better than lattes I've got from local coffee joints, much cheaper and less calories (with an additional plus that I can use the soy milk I like).<br /><br />From my first experience of steeping up my own real matcha, I found I have a new favorite tea. Red Leaf Tea's Caramel Matcha is tasty, better than anything I had from a mix or made from a coffee shop. I had more control over the amount of sweetener and milk.<br /><br />Red Leaf was very clear in their instructions on how to prepare matcha so a newbie like me could make a perfect cup.<br />With that said, I'm totally going to try more matchas from Red Leaf Teas. First, I think having a frother/hand mixer or bamboo whisk would of made the matcha frothing process go faster - especially for impatient "I need tea now!" types like me. of matcha would be fabulous.

Thanks to this company, I don't have to do that anymore - AND I can control the sugar amount!<br /><br />Upon pouring out the contents of the robustly-flavored Caramel Green Matcha from the non-resealable, gold foil packaging into the tin, I could smell the sweetness of caramel. I HAD to make a bowl right then and there!<br /><br />For this first preparation I sifted a teaspoon of matcha powder into my bowl - I highly recommend doing this! Without it, you risk the chance of having clumpy matcha, and no one wants that! I wisked in two ounces of warmed water with my electric frother until the matcha was fully dissolved. Filled the bowl with the rest of the warmed water, about 6 ounces worth.<br /><br />I found the caramel missing an element - maybe it's sweetness, which is something I usually associate with caramel. While Red Leaf Tea doesn't add any sugar to their matchas, I found this benefited from some added sweetener.<br /><br />I also think I might prefer the Caramel Matcha prepared as a sweeter latte - either hot or cold.<br /><br />I do look forward to playing around with the Caramel Matcha more - mixing it with other flavored matchas from this company. Caramel Cheesecake, Caramel Green Apple, Caramel Espresso, Caramel Vanilla, just to name a few! Oooo and I bet baking with this is going to be AMAZING!

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: In a word, this matcha is YUMMY!<br /><br />But, you probably want more than one word, so, I will add a few more!<br /><br />I love the sweet, delicious, creaminess of this flavored matcha.  Sure, I prefer unflavored Matcha most of the time, but sometimes I want to change things up a bit, and I love the selection of flavors that Red Leaf Tea offers, and the flavors are amazingly good.  This would make a great dessert substitute that is so delicious that you'll forget that it's quite good for you too!<br /><br />Really and truly yummy.  If you like caramel and you like Matcha, you're in for a treat with this.  If you're new to Matcha - this would be a really good starting point too ... then again, this is so delicious, it might be difficult to try something else if you start here!<br /><br />YUM!

review/text: I love caramel and I would kill for this tea. I had no doubts about caramel and matcha working well together. I think that caramel makes magic with anything it touches. And it definitely makes magic with matcha. The flavor of the tea is like the best caramel candy I've ever had, only in liquid form so I can get more of it into me faster. It makes a killer latte and I'm sure it would be just amazing in baked goods. I can't wait to try a caramel matcha cake!

review/summary: Fantastic flavoured matcha!
review/text: I've been meaning to try Matcha again for quite a long time and this is my first foray back into it... it was well worth it. I traveled to Japan in 2009 and unknowingly had Matcha several times at random sushi restaurants, etc. It was interesting there but I just figured it was a normal green tea, nothing special right? Oh man, was I wrong! This stuff really is something to pay attention to, and the different flavor and health benefits possible with matcha are well beyond any standard green tea. This is really a fascinating beverage and I am excited to get back into it.<br /><br />Before this, I had never tried a flavoured matcha, in fact I had no idea such a thing could exist! Red Leaf pulls off the flavoured matcha with grace and skill, and offers a wild and impressive set of expected (vanilla bean, caramel, etc.) flavours and some wildly crazy and epic sounding ones (Coca Cola Matcha?!!!!) I am gonna have to try that one.<br /><br />I bought the Red Leaf Starter (Basic Grade), Delicate flavouring of Caramel Matcha. This is available on their site here: [...]<br /><br />Since I am a bit of a matcha newbie, I had to read their site about how to prepare it. It was very helpful. I got a whisk from Japantown and used a Chashaku (Bamboo Scoop) to measure out the matcha. I used 2 scoops and my first cup used the suggested amount, 3 oz of 80C water. I whisked it, poured it from the bowl to a mug and drank it from a mug, no extra water added. This was my previous experience with matcha in general, quite thick and vegetal. It was good.<br />In fact it was so good, I found myself going back to the kitchen to make a 2nd cup of it not 1 hr later!! This time I decided to change it up a bit, using only 1 scoop of matcha this time and a little less water, and then after whisking, adding a fair bit more water to reduce the thickness and make a larger drink. I think I actually enjoyed this better, it was a little sweeter this way and also allowed for a more tea-like experience (rather than a sort of "tea shot" like I had earlier). This was very tasty!<br /><br />These are the only ways I have prepared it so far but I think it might be wiser (for my unrefined palate!) to buy the "Distinctive" flavouring next time so that I can get a stronger flavor. This one is subtle, but I tend to enjoy stronger more bold flavourings in my tea, so I think the next one I get from Red Leaf I will pay just a little extra to get more flavouring. Excited to follow this new tasty and healthy habit!

review/summary: My Tea Addiction...
review/text: This is my absolute favorite tea; in the cooler months I have a cup every night after dinner. It has a natural sweetness so I have never added sugar and it doesn't need any milk either. It has a warm, spicy taste reminiscent of fireballs candies but without the "bite" or sugary taste. I find it fills that after dinner craving for something sweet without caving in and having dessert. This tea has such a nice balance and depth to it; I can't be without it. I am moving out of the country for a few years and panicked when I thought I could end up without my stash so I stocked up with a year's supply and will get more when I come home for the holidays.

It has a rather funny aftertaste that will take several days of getting used too. YES, it's still good, but sadly it is not nearly as good as the tea bags.

review/text: I am very particular about what I feed my 7 pound Maltese and generally don't give him commercially made food or treats after so many pet food scares.  However, these are made with "real" food, and I would feel safe eating them myself (although I don't!).  Charly likes them and I feel good giving them to him.  They're a bit bigger than I need for my little guy, so I break them up a bit.  They break easily enough that I can give him 1/4 to 1/2 at a time as a treat.

But since my dog eats the salmon and chicken dry dog food from the HALO brand for years, and he loves it, so I was going to give a try for the dog treats.  For some reason, he didn't want to eat it at all - probably it doesn't have a strong dog food/chicken smell?  But I'm sure they made it with good ingredients - I can see the oats in the biscuits.  I wish they could improve the flavor a bit to attract the dogs more - since I have seen other reviewer having similar comments.

review/text: I received a free sample of the Liv-a-Littles Healthsome dog biscuits with real chicken. This small biscuit, which you can see visible rolled oats in, prides itself on being oven-baked, with high-quality natural ingredients. Unfortunately, JP - my 11 year old picky pit bull - took it from my hand like a kid forced to swallow an oatmeal vitamin coated with vegetables. He eventually ate it, but it lacked the palability to please my dog.<br /><br />The ingredients include (in order): whole wheat flour, chicken, potato flour, pea flour, chicken liver, rolled oats, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), pumpkin, tomatoes, apples, sweet potatoes, cranberries, split peas, carrots, green beans, green bell pepper, celery, parsley, and ascorbic acid (a preservative - Vitamin C). While it has all the healthy veggies in it that your mom would be proud of, it failed the Lee palatability test. One paw down for palatability. Of course, if you own a Labrador retriever who'll eat anything, he'll like them, but they didn't pass JP's palate.

It has roughly half the sodium that Shin has, (Shin having between 30-50% depending on the flavour you get).<br /><br />If you interested in trying some different kind of noodles for some reason or another, then I would recommend trying this.

review/text: I love dark roast coffee, served with or without cream/sugar, and this Sumatran k-cup is most assuredly a dark roast, but I found the flavor and aroma of this product to register as slightly bitter/burnt.  It did not overwhelm my senses, and it was easily alleviated and made better with the use of creamer, but it still wasn't my favorite of the K-Cups that are available.  I thought it was "okay".<br /><br />My husband didn't enjoy the Starbucks version of Sumatra, stating that he felt it had a somewhat chemical-like aftertaste even with cream and sugar.  We used over half of the box, to make sure that our opinion wasn't perhaps based on a faulty serving or two, but ended up giving the remainder to our neighbors; unfortunately, this Sumatra just didn't work for us.

If you're using a travel mug, stick with the dark roasts.  Wish it came in decaf - I love my Keurig, but I can handle only so much caffeine!<br />Also, I have found the Starbucks K-cups disassemble easily (more so than some of the other brands), the foil removes very cleanly, you can compost the grounds and paper filter, and recycle the plastic.

review/summary: Best K-Cup yet.
review/text: I prefer grinding my own coffee and using my Aeropress to the K-Cup for single serving brews. When I heard Starbucks was coming out with a K-Cup I was genuinely excited! For two years I've dealt with weak "dark" roasts. Iced coffees with a K-Cup are a joke. While nothing will come close to espresso out of a Keurig (I recommend the Mypressi Twist V2 if you are on a budget), the Sumatra Dark from Starbucks is the best K-Cup yet. It is smooth, dark and even brewed with crema. This is not acidic like many of the South American blend K-Cups. It is slightly more expensive, but it has made me start using my Keurig again.<br /><br /> I would have given it 5 stars, but one cup of the 5 I've made so far came out a touch weak.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor if you shelled out the cash on a Keurig. Get the Sumatra!!!

review/summary: Very good
review/text: So far, I've only tried this one and Pike's Place (see my review for that here) and I have to say the Sumatra is superior to Pike's Place, with a satisfyingly rich, bold flavor. In the coming days I'll try their House Blend and French Roast to compare and post quick reviews on them as well.

review/summary: Excellent K cups if you get it at a good price
review/text: Im not a huge fan of starbucks pike place but I like some random starbucks coffees so I decided to try this K cup.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Tastes good, bold and darker but not too bitter<br />-Dark but not over roasted<br />-I got it on sale (BOGO in starbucks store: ~$.50 a cup)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Pretty expensive online and in the grocery store<br /><br />Overall I like it, but would wait for it to go on sale again

review/text: This product arrived with several of the items damaged in shipping.  The coffee was very good with robust flavor and slightly acidic.  Because of the poor condition of the coffee when it arrived, not all the cups were usable. I found this coffee was best suited for  morning.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: Came quickly (a couple of days), and is exactly what it's supposed to be - Starbucks Sumatra. We started using a K-cup machine in our office and, being a self-proclaimed coffee snob, I wasn't so sure I would like it. These Sumatra K-cups aren't QUITE the same as my French press or even what  you get when you go to Starbucks. But, it's good coffee, cheaper than Starbucks or even the grocery store, and came right away. I'll be ordering again soon.

review/summary: Simply the best K-Cup made
review/text: If you're like me and like to try out every single K-Cup that comes out, you know a few things about them:<br /><br />1. If they don't say "Extra Bold," they're terrible<br />2. The coffee always looks and feels a little "flat."<br />3. It's easier than drip, but never better<br /><br />This Starbucks Sumatra K-cup, though, rocks. You see it right away as the coffee comes out with a nice foamy top. Then it tastes great, with or without milk. It doesn't quite taste like a "freshly" brewed Sumatra, but it's as close to real coffee as the K-cup gets.

review/summary: Moldy and rancid brew (evaluated over a year's time)
review/text: I often find the Starbucks K cups yield a moldy and rancid tasting brew. We have tried an assortment of Starbucks K cups flavors obtained at numerous outlets over the last year. It feels like this is a secondary (or even tertiary) market for Starbucks beans that don't make the grade. Or possibly Starbucks has production/storage/transportation issues when bringing the Starbucks K cups to market. It is a ding to the brand. Luckily, I am a devout Starbucks follower, so I will stick to their more proven bags of beans and grinds.

review/summary: Excellent to have around ...
review/text: It mixes easily with water or milk.  No blender required, though blending does make it frothy.<br /><br />It's a great emergency-preparedness item to have on hand.<br /><br />Tastes good, and even better if for some reason you haven't eaten and are famished.  If you have any insulin resistance going on, you will crash because of the high sugar content.  This is not great nutrition as with some of the protein powders, but with milk it suffices nicely.<br /><br />This is not a breakfast "food" per se, in my opinion.  It's a snack to tide you over, not a substitute for a meal.  Sending a kid off to school after only a serving of this would be unconscionable.<br /><br />It's more akin to a chocolate shake.  Makes a nice treat, or dessert beverage.<br /><br />It is what it is, and it excels at that.  No need to make it more than it is.

review/summary: I've Given My Heart To These Pepperidge Farm Cookies !!!
review/text: Pepperidge Farm has a long history of making premium quality cookies; and these "Chessmen" butter cookies are certainly no exception. They contain no artificial flavors, no preservatives and they are crunchy but oh, so wonderfully smooth as you roll them around in your mouth before you swallow them. Awesome!<br /><br />Another reviewer notes that they are aesthetically pleasing; and that reviewer is correct. The cookies have four chessmen on them--you get the rook, the bishop, the queen and the knight--this enhances the appeal of the product. Yes, chess players will love that; but just about anyone who enjoys a good cookie can appreciate these butter cookies. Even if butter cookies aren't your personal favorite, you will fall for these ones--they're THAT good!<br /><br />The cookies are kosher, if that matters to you; and they are certainly designed tastefully enough that you can serve them as snacks for any company you may have visiting you. One caveat, however--these cookies do contain sugar and some fat; and the sugar could convert to extra fat in your body if you are not too active. If sugar and/or fat content pose dietary concerns for you then I would ask a doctor before eating these cookies.<br /><br />Overall, obviously, these cookies are just about the best and they will remain some of the best because of the classic Pepperidge Farm high level of quality control. Buy a bag or two and enjoy some tonight!  SMILES

review/text: We were out grocery shopping the other day and, for some reason, the Chessmen cookies called out to me. Usually, I'm not a fan of crunchy cookies, even if they ARE from the delectable Pepperidge Farm bakery.<br /><br />But I decided to try these buttery treats and let me tell you...I am not disappointed! (In fact, I'm munching on them right now.) They are so buttery--so melt in your mouth--they'd be *perfect* with coffee, tea, or hot chocolate--but I tend to snatch them when I need a snack because I haven't eaten all day. (I know...bad habit!)<br /><br />And, this may sound corny, they are beautiful to look at! Not only do these cookies have a raised chess emblem on the front, but they are also washed with eggwhites. (I can tell because of the glistening, golden color!)<br /><br />Rook, Bishop, Queen and Knight--they're all here in buttery brilliance!<br /><br />So if you're in the mood for a fantastic butter cookie, you will LOVE Chessmen from Pepperidge Farm. (And if your favorite soldier or student loves chess--and cookies--this would make a great addition to any care package!)

They have a nice size, and a nice sweet flavor with just the right amount of tang and zip to them.  They're so good that I could eat them plain out of the jar!  (I rarely do, however...  Instead, they go in my Bombay Sapphire gibson-martinis.)

review/summary: Healthy enjoyment
review/text: I have recently discovered dirty martinis. My brother in law is the culprit of leading me astray while away on a cruise. I was later up in Upstate NY and purchased some onions to go along with my latest vice when I noticed they were not salty but very tasty! I am a person who loves sweet things espcially if they are pickled. These were the perfect match for me. Since then, my wife and I have been trying to lose weight. Yes, we are watching our fat intake but have discovered it is the salt added to everything that is killing us all. Look at a regular pearl onion and how much salt is in them, it will blow you away. Oh, and the olives, too. Compare that to these new Tipsy Onions and you'll do what I am doing....One Olive and three Tipsys make a wonderful Martini!!!

review/summary: Good onions, but sweeter than I expected.
review/text: These onions are nice, large and crispy - however they are sweeter than I anticipated.  Personally, I prefer a more savory onion for maritinis. I am by no means disappointed with them. They are very flavorful and I love that they are large.  If you prefer a cocktail onion a little on the sweet side these are a fantastic purchase. All of the onions I received were white - no browning at all and packaged very well.

review/summary: Brown onions
review/text: The ordered arrived packed well, but that was as far as it went. The color of the vermouth was brownish and the onions were clearly past their useful date. I wouldn't order from these again at any price. Buyer beware.

review/text: These delightfully tasting onions is what makes the difference in a vodka gibson.I used to have regular onions in my gibsons and they were ok, but having a bartender make me one with these onions showed me the difference an onion can make. Glad that I walked into that bar.....

review/summary: DIS-GUST-ING
review/text: I purchased these very large cans of chili because they were priced ridiculously cheaply at the time. I planned to split the cans up into smaller portions and freeze the smaller portions to make a large number of meals. The first can I opened looked a little different from other Hormel chili I have had in the past. The beans were all mashed up and there were large chunks of cubed meat in the chili. Normally the meat resembles little pieces of ground meat. These were weird unappetizing chunks. The chili had no chili taste. It tasted like slightly burned re-fried beans. The night after eating this and the next day, there were numerous trips to the bathroom. Won't give details - but it wasn't pleasant.<br />A few days later, I opened a second can hoping the first was just a one time thing. The second had the same mashed up beans and meat chunks. I tossed it and now have four large cans of chili that I will never use.<br />Maybe this was just a bad batch. It almost seems as if they scraped the old chili residue off of their pots, threw in some leftover meat chunks, canned it and sent it to me. Needless to say, I will never purchase this product again.

review/summary: Hard to believe a teabag can make sencha this good
review/text: I was given two bags of this sencha over the last two years, and have absolutely loved it. It tastes MUCH better than any of the other bagged "green tea" varieties that I've tried so far. It has a nice, robust grassy flavor.<br />I also noticed that the tea is actually GREEN when brewed whereas most other green tea brands are a pale yellow/brown color. (Not that the color is important--I just found that kind of cool)<br />I highly recommend this brand, and will buy some more once my last 10 carefully-rationed teabags are gone.

review/text: The foil-wrapped Maeda-en sencha tea bag is the best-quality bagged green tea that I have ever tried (I've been drinking green tea for over 30 years). It is full of fresh flavors, unlike the other brands commonly found in the grocery store. Worth the extra effort to order it.

review/summary: My cats don't like it and my Vet doesn't recommend it
review/text: My cat was sick and not eating well so I bought this on advice of a coworker after my cat had gotten a force feeding and meds from the Vet. She wouldn't touch it! I was surprised because both my cats like to lick the milk out of my cereal bowl when I am done. I asked my Vet what the major difference was between cat milk and people  milk, she said they are basically the same but cats milk has taurine added to it, a nutrient that cats need more of. The vet recommended to give the cat regular milk and a taurine supplement if she would eat that. Luckily, after second force feeding she started eating again so I didn't need to go that route. My Vet said that cat milk is way over priced for what you get,

review/summary: The right stuff for kittens.
review/text: A great product as always from KMR. This is premixed liquid in pop-top cans, so there is no fussing with dry powder.  If you have a big batch of kittens that need this milk replacer this is the way to go.  Yes, it's a bit pricey but worth every cent. As always, this is also great stuff for sick or elderly cats--or nursing queens!--that need extra nutrition.

review/text: When I learned from the vet that the kitten I brought home was only five weeks old (not eight as I'd been told), I bought this formula for him.<br /><br />He is now a year old, strong, frisky, and healthy.  I had no problem getting him to drink it--apparently he loved the taste.

review/summary: PetAg KMR Beats Any Others Paws Down
review/text: PetAg's KMR, (kitten milk replacement,) is, in my experience, the most highly recommended and best-tolerated formula for newborn and young kittens available on the market.  I personally prefer the liquid, as the powder can be difficult to dissolve properly, though it is more economical and easier to make in the amounts you need at any given time.  In my experience, kittens take to it well and don't suffer as many digestive issues as with some other brands.  I recommend a specially-designed formula such as Just-Born with colostrum for the first 2-3 days for kittens who are exclusively bottle-fed from birth, as the colostrum helps establish a newborn's immune system, which most formulas don't, but after the first few days, colostrum is merely broken down in the digestive tract and gives no added protection, so then it's time for KMR.  Follow feeding directions carefully and watch your little ones thrive on this superior formula!  It's never let us down.

review/summary: Sassafras candy sticks
review/text: I was very happy to find these. I always looked for sassafras flavor candy as a kid, and these are just like them.  It was my favorite flavor of candy. Although the flavor is reminiscent of root beer, sassafras is not sweet like it but a touch bitter, which explains why I found root beer candy too sweet. Not a flavor for everyone, but anyone who likes spice flavors might like them.<br /><br />As for the packaging, there was almost no breakage of the candy, which was impressive, as candy sticks tend to be very fragile.
