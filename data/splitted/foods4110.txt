review/summary: Very good!
review/text: The marshmallows taste delicious and the texture is fantastic. I have seen them melted before, but they don't really melt totally in my hot chocolate. I wouldn't buy them through Amazon though, as they are much affordable elsewhere. I think they're usually about $7 although I just bought 2 bags for $5 at the Vegan Mania fest! In any case, these are delicious marshmallows! If you can find them for a cheaper price than Amazon, I recommend them.

review/summary: Soooo delicious!
review/text: I've been a vegetarian for nearly 20 years and mostly not much I've missed.....but marshmallows....ahhh there is just something about them that takes you back to childhood. Okay, I was skeptical that these would taste anything like I remembered marshmallows tasting.....man was I pleasantly surprised....they really taste almost exactly like I remembered. The texture is great, they are sweet and do in fact get melty and gooey in hot chocolate or on a graham cracker w/chocolate. I was sooooo thrilled to find these and soooo glad I gave them a try...didn't think I'd ever get to have smores again, so glad I was wrong. Give them a try they are great and worth the slightly high price tag for any veg dying for a little taste of childhood!

review/summary: SO TINY!
review/text: After not having a s'more in 16 years, I was beyond excited to find marshmallows that I can eat!  (I don't eat gelatin).  I waited in anticipation to get these and they JUST arrived.  Before I even opened the package, the disappointment began.  The marshmallows came in a bubble envelope!  Not a box, an envelope.  So I was prepared for them to be a bit squished.  Then, upon opening the envelope, I discovered that they weren't as squished as they had appeared from the outside.  The flatness of the package was mainly due to these marshmallows being super tiny!  I'm going to need at least 6 to make a s'more.<br /><br />So even after all of that, I'll still give them a 4 star rating because they really do have the consistency of a "real" marshmallow.  My husband couldn't tell the difference.  The price is a bit ridiculous as well, but I decided to go for it since it had been so long since my last marshmallow experience.  I'll update later after my s'more attempt.<br /><br />UPDATE:  They roast just like regular marshmallows.  Awesome.  We used 3-4 marshmallows per s'more.

review/summary: Delicious, an amazing alternative!
review/text: I've been a vegetarian for a little over six years now, and for the first few years I was really bad about looking for gelatin in the ingredients of things I used to eat. The past three years or so I've gotten much better, and was ecstatic to find this alternative to marshmallows that contained no animal products. I ordered two bags for some various baking recipes to try, and I ended up making only one batch of fondant and then eating the rest of these on their own! They are SO delicious! They taste a lot better than regular marshmallows, and I gave them to my entire family to try (none of whom are vegetarians or vegans) and they loved them. Great, great product. I will definitely be ordering these more in the future.

review/summary: Vegan, Food Allergy Friendly, & Delicious!
review/text: I ordered Dandies Vegan Marshmallows after much research and consideration...why should marshmallows cost so much??? Well we soon found out in my house that they are, in fact, worth their weight in gold! My son, who at the age of 6 had yet to ever experience smores,has several severe food allergies including dairy and egg and finding products free of these ingredients is challenging to say the least. Add to that the need to find products also made in facilities free of these ingredients, on dedicated equipment and the choices become virtually non-existent, especially for a product like marshmallows.  These marshmallows are delicious! We tested the marshmallows as soon as they arrived and unfortunately we cannot attest to their smore making capabilities because they didn't last long enough to make it to the campfire! You won't be sorry and you will wonder why you didn't try them sooner! My only complaint is that they are currently unavailable unless purchased in bulk quantities...hopefully Amazon will be able to offer them in smaller quantities soon!

review/summary: Hot Biscuits
review/text: One night, a few weeks ago, a friend of mine told me a story about eating hot homemade biscuits topped with sorghum molasses. As a California native, I had never heard about this "mystery" molasses so in a spur-of-the-moment Amazon shopping "trip", I found this sampler and without hesitation, I used the 1-click ordering and then started counting down the days. The box arrived the next week, well packed to avoid breakage. Included were 3 jars of sorghum and a hand written thank you note that I thought was the coolest thing. Who does that these days? Anyhow, I'm not at all an expert sorghum taste-tester but my friend certainly seemed to be. I did try a bit on a piece of bacon on the day my friend came to pick up the goods and found it to be the perfect amount of sweetness. Its sweetness is between regular molasses and honey...it was "just right". We've not had the chance to get together for a true sorghum breakfast, so I've yet to try the magical combination of hot biscuits topped with sorghum. I did ask if it was what he remembered as a child, and he's certain that it is...and is now researching recipes to use it in. Maybe one day I'll get some hot biscuits from him!! LOL<br /><br />Overall we were really happy with the product and delivery...even more pleasantly surprised by the hand written thank you letter. Awesome!!! And delicious!

review/summary: Love this product in place of using sugar
review/text: I noticed one reviewer mentioned that the individual packaging was wasteful...but I also noticed that moisture builds up easily in the jar once opened. Date sugar is pure fruit so caking will take place if not used up in a timely fashion.  Had this been one huge jar, it might have turned into one huge lump of hardened date sugar before I used it all up, so I understand the need for individual packaging and smaller containers.<br /><br />I try to stay off refined sugar and date sugar has enabled me to bake cookies, muffins, cakes and use far less refined sugar by subbing half with date sugar..  It works very well and blends into recipes with ease.<br />Just what I was looking for...and the taste is wonderful!

review/summary: Mindblowingly Good
review/text: It wasn't until I bought a bag of these when I finally learned what good potato chips taste like. It's sort of like the epiphany you have when you think American cheese is the best cheese you've ever had until you actually try smoked gouda. I know that sounds like an overstatement, but that's how good Herr's Heinz-flavored ketchup chips are. Once you try these, all of your previous favorites will start to pale in comparison.<br /><br />"What's so darned great about them?" you are probably wondering. What's gotten everyone in such a tizzy? Why the rave reviews and the almost cult-like devotion to these chips? It's not just because they taste good. It's because Herr's is one of the few snack makers that bucks that shady practice so many of them engage in now, especially Pringles. You know what I mean-- that cute, little trick of advertising their chips as literally bursting with flavor, when in reality the chips are so lightly dusted that there's barely any flavor to them. Herr's philosophy in terms of chip-to-flavor ratio couldn't be more different. Open any one of their snacks-- especially this one-- and the chips are so covered in powder that it's impossible to not have it cake up on your finger tips without constantly cleaning them. These Heinz ketchup flavored chips are so heavily dusted, in fact, that you'll wind up with red-stained fingers for a few hours after gorging on them. It makes for a messy experience but in the end, getting a moutful of flavor with each bite makes the hassle of cleaning up all worthwhile!<br /><br />Sure, this excessive powder doesn't exactly make Herr's the healthiest of snack choices, but what snack is? It's all gonna kill us, anyway, so really-- all this really comes down to is choosing our poison. My poison happens to be these chips, and will most likely be yours once you taste them and subsequently become hopelessly addicted like me.

review/summary: Great flavor, Ketchup Chips
review/text: First time trying Herr's brand Ketchup potato chips, really love them. Its just as good as other brand catsup chips that I've tried in Canada. Glad these chips are available here in the U.S. and uses great flavoring with Heinz brand ketchup. Many think it may seem odd to have ketchup on chips, its similar to eating normally fries and ketchup. It doesn't have that strong of a overwhelming ketchup flavor on the chips, which is great, reason many of my friends like them<br /><br />If really want a stronger ketchup flavored taste, I personally recommend get a bottle of Heinz ketchup and dip your ketchup flavored chips into some actual ketchup, like you would with fries.

review/text: When these Herr's ketchup-flavored chips first hit the market, I remember I was taking some assembly in high school and a worker from Herr's was trying to convince the class to take a free bag of chips.  Everyone was either disinterested or disgusted by the thought of ketchup chips, and I regret following suit and leaving with the classmates while ignoring the free miniature bag samples in the box.  I strongly regret it in fact.  These chips are *awesome!*  I highly recommend them.  Don't just ignore them because the thought of ketchup on a potato chip sounds unappealing- they're actually really good.

review/text: The product is amazingly addictive, but the price quoted here is way beyond bad.  At my local Save-A-Lot, I can buy a 3.75 ounce bag for $1.00, no tax.  If this is 42 1-ounce bags, then that would total 11.2 regular bags, or $11.20 ($12 rounded to a full bag).  The official site is just as bad wanting to sell a box of 15 normal bags for $25 before shipping.<br /><br />My local store is running out, but I don't want to be paying this much for wholesale.

review/summary: Ketchup chips are great, but these aren't them
review/text: There is currently a problem with this item entry in Amazon.  The description that comes up in a search, before you get to this page, is "Herr's Potato Chips, Heinz Ketchup Flavored, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 42)."<br /><br />I ordered this and got a 42-bag variety pack of various other chips like BBQ and regular, not any ketchup-flavored ones.  Upon closer examination, the description that is on this page just lists "Herr's Potato Chips," in contrast to the other description.<br /><br />I was able to return the item, but was informed that there are no Herr's Ketchup-Flavored Chips available.  (And I really don't get that.  If the ketchup-flavored chips are so popular and in such demand, you'd think that Herr's would do something about ramping up their production accordingly, and maybe ramping down some of the other flavors, because these chips are pretty much NEVER available.  But apparently I'm talking crazy talk.)<br /><br />Oh well.

review/summary: Addictive
review/text: A couple of years ago, my Wal-Mart carried large bags of these for a short time and I was instantly hooked but when they stopped, I couldn't get them without ordering directly from Herr's site which was a bit of a hassle. Now that I can get them from Amazon, feeding my addiction is easier and more convenient.<br /><br />Although I generally like BBQ and spicy foods, most BBQ flavored chips and jalepeno/salsa/hot flavored chips taste somewhat bland and very artificial to me. It's not that I can't taste the flavors; it's just that they don't seem to resemble the actual taste of BBQ or peppers or salsa, etc. But with these chips, it really tastes like eating crisp french fries smothered in ketchup, and licking my bright red fingertips clean is half the fun!<br /><br />Packaging was a little excessive. Looks like Herr's ships their standard store-delivery box (already well padded) to Amazon which puts the entire Herr's box into an Amazon box for shipment to you. Net result is that you get a huge box with a whole lot of tape, plastic, and cardboard between you and the chips.

Eventhough, I'm no fan of ketchup, but I am a fan of chips. Ketchup is old-school and out-dated. Away with ketchup! (not really) So anyways, turns out, these chips had great taste to it. Has more tomatoe taste than I think it should have. Nevertheless, experience the crisp crunchiness of potatoe chips, in the flavor of french-fries dipped in ketchup! Perpare your face for a smile!

review/text: This is a special type of brown rice that adds pizazz to any meal.  It's almost as special as wild rice: dark, very aromatic and has a dense, crunchy texture.  Use about 2 cups water for each cup of rinsed dry rice (you can add a bit of butter for true luxury).  Cook over a low flame; it may take a bit longer, but it's worth it. I don't use salt because I find the flavor satisfactory without it. If you find the rice is too crunchy for your taste, you can add a bit more water at the end of the cooking and heat gently.<br />PS Amazon's price for this rice is excellent.

review/summary: Gourmet Rice Meets Middle America
review/text: Wehani rice is great by itself, as a side dish, or for just about any casserole. The deep reddish brown after cooking adds a special dash of color. Its aroma while cooking reminds me of the scent of freshly popped popcorn. The flavor is like a combination of white rice and cashews.<br /><br />Because it is a high fiber rice, the texture is less crunchy and more like white rice when I add an extra ounce (2 tablespoons) of water to the 2 cups water when cooking a cup of Wehani, and cook 5 minutes longer.<br /><br />Wehani makes a wonderful "Hopping John." To make, mix 2 parts cooked Wehani and 2 parts cooked blackeyed peas. Add chili pepper to taste, and mix in 1 part your favorite salsa. This becomes a flavorful family meal!

review/summary: This is SO GOOD!!!
review/text: Not only does it taste wonderful but it fills your house with an amazing aroma.  The  rice cooks up into dark reddish brown fat chewy grains.  I make it in a pot as directed or in the microwave.  Both methods turn out great.  My microwave is medium power (I can't find the tag that says exactly what wattage it is) and I use a ceramic casserole with ceramic lid, roomy enough to allow for the bubbling rice and water and not leak out.  Put in one cup of rice and two cups of water (I add a pinch of salt and a tablespoon or so of olive oil but you don't have to) then cook on high for five minutes.  Leave it in the oven undisturbed and cook on medium for 45 minutes more.  Let it sit at least fifteen minutes before removing the lid.  This rice will be a staple in my cupboard from now on.  A batch of rice makes a complete meal of just about anything, especially leftover veggies and/or fish.

review/summary: Brown Mice
review/text: Brown rice (or "hulled rice") is unmilled or partly milled rice, a kind of whole, natural grain. It has a mild nutty flavor, is chewier and more nutritious than white rice, and becomes rancid much more quickly. Any rice, including long-grain, short-grain, or sticky rice, may be eaten as brown rice.<br /><br />In much of Asia, brown rice (Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese) is associated with poverty and wartime shortages, and in the past was rarely eaten except by the sick, the elderly and as a cure for constipation. This traditionally denigrated kind of rice is now more expensive than common white rice, partly due to its relatively low supply and difficulty of storage and transport.<br /><br />Brown rice and white rice have similar amounts of calories, carbohydrates, and protein. The main differences between the two forms of rice lie in processing and nutritional content.<br /><br />When only the outermost layer of a grain of rice (the husk) is removed, brown rice is produced. To produce white rice, the next layers underneath the husk (the bran layer and the germ) are removed, leaving mostly the starchy endosperm.<br /><br />Several vitamins and dietary minerals are lost in this removal and the subsequent polishing process. A part of these missing nutrients, such as Vitamin B1, Vitamin B3, and iron are sometimes added back into the white rice making it "enriched", as food suppliers in the US are required to do by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<br /><br />One mineral not added back into white rice is magnesium; one cup (195 grams) of cooked long grain brown rice contains 84 mg of magnesium while one cup of white rice contains 19 mg.<br /><br />When the bran layer is removed to make white rice, the oil in the bran is also removed. Rice bran oil may help lower LDL cholesterol.<br /><br />Among other key sources of nutrition lost are small amounts of fatty acids and fiber.<br /><br />In addition to having greater nutritional value, brown rice is also said to be less constipating than white rice.<br /><br />Brown rice can remain in storage for months under normal conditions, but hermetic storage and freezing can significantly extend its lifetime. Freezing, even periodically, can also help control infestations of Indian meal moths.

review/summary: Good hot or cold
review/text: To me this rice is so different than my regular rice (long grain brown) that I think of it as a different grain. Yes, the aroma is interesting; I'd say it takes a bit of getting used to. I really enjoy the size and texture of the cooked grains. After trying the Wehani by itself, I began cooking 1/3 Wehani, 1/3 Lundberg Brown Basmati and 1/3 either brown rice store brand or Wang sweet brown rice that I get at an Asian supermarket. I always saute the rice in a bit of vegetable oil 'til it is browned, before adding the liquid. This combo and browning seems to develop the nutty flavor that I favor. [However, I've found that when browning the rice, not to overdo it because if the rice gets too roasted it will no longer cook normally - apparently it loses its ability to absorb water. Then you get the crunchies.]<br /><br />I do find that Wehani takes considerably longer to fully absorb the water. I use the regular 2:1 ratio, water to rice (plus salt). It is my practice to bring it to a rolling boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer for 2 hours. It just means planning ahead a bit further.<br /><br />Often I cook meat at the same time in the same pot, starting both together so the rice will gain the flavoring of the meat juices. When I do that, I adjust the other liquid downward. The one alert I'd post is that the strong coloring of the rice stains the meat, especially when using the Wehani alone. Doesn't bother me, but you might want to know this will happen.<br /><br />Chilled cooked Wehani rice makes a fine salad with the addition of minced garlic, fresh ginger root pared then diced, finely sliced scallions, chopped fresh parsley and Chinese five-spice. Add other garden veggies that you have on hand, extra virgin olive oil if you wish and consider the taste treat of balsamic vinegar. Yum!

review/text: Yes, I should have read the whole description, so I take part of the blame.  However, I can't see how in any way how this rice could be considered "RED" as stated in the title above:<br /><br />"A Gourmet Aromatic Whole Grain RED Rice"<br /><br />Nowhere on the front of the bag does it clarify that it's brown rice as it does on the back.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's bad rice, just that it's not RED as the title clearly states.<br /><br />There is a specific type of rice known as "red rice".  This is NOT it.  When it arrived in the mail, the front label says "RED RICE" on the back it says it's brown rice.<br /><br />So, yes, I should have read the whole description closer, but just calling brown rice red on the label doesn't make it so.<br /><br />Disappointed, will not be buying any more Lundberg products.  Sorry, but you ticked me off with your misleading labeling.

Mr. Harris would never admit it because he never was one for product endorsements, but I'mma blow the lid off this mystery: He was talking about Coffee-mate's Pumpkin Spice Creamer.<br /><br />Upon hearing that this product existed, I promptly began to hyperventilate and had to be awakened by smelling salts. To say that I love anything pumpkin-flavored would be the biggest understatement since... well... I'm looking for historical precedents here, but I'm really not well-versed in the history of understatements. Anyway, I digress; after being awakened, I promptly drove 107 mph the entire way to the store, causing 7 minor traffic accidents, a stampede of antelope, and at least one unplanned pregnancy. I then sprinted to the Dairy section, mind racked with anticipation and apprehension; would they truly have the Holy Grail of coffee creamers, or would I be left utterly disappointed, like that time when I was seven and my parents ate my entire birthday cake right in front of me, laughing the whole time?<br /><br />And then, I saw it: A fully-stocked shelf of Coffee-mate Pumpkin Spice Creamer. I gasped in delight as I grabbed the nearest bottle off of the shelf, passionately ripped off the lid, clawed desperately at that Godforsaken plastic freshness seal, and chugged the entire bottle on the spot. For what seemed like hours, I collapsed on the floor of the supermarket, chest heaving in pure ecstasy as a subtle afterglow began to emanate from every pore of my skin.<br /><br />Long story short, I'm serving a lengthy prison sentence now for not only my incredibly lewd public display (I don't even REMEMBER taking my pants off), but also my inadvertent destruction of the entire Dairy section. And you know something? I'd do it ALL again. And I will, as soon as I'm out. Be prepared.<br /><br />Also, it's now January, so if you want in on this, RUN to your nearest grocery store and get some, or else you will live in regret until October when it comes out again. Cheers!

review/summary: Pretty good for Coffee-mate
review/text: I get coffee-mate creamer all the time, but I don't actually love it, it's just all I've ever used since becoming an adult. Usually I find the taste a little sweet but kind of bland with a poor after-taste...I usually use Hazelnut, but I've tried many flavors and it's all about the same effect for me. I don't mind too much, but I'm not in love with it. I tried this seasonal flavor last December and it was a higher caliber. Very tasty, rich-but not too rich, and certainly gave a warm holiday feeling. Was more like a coffee shop experience. I want that all the time so I have to order it here.

review/text: I'm a huge fan of the pumpkin spice coffee that's being sold at starbucks.  It gets expensive, my bestfriend told me that coffee mate was selling this so I gave it a try.  I'm very impressed by the quality and taste, the only down side is 5 grams of sugar for 1 tablespoon.  I recommend to any one reading this to buy it but go easy on the teaspoons.

review/text: Autumn is my favorite time of year because the pumpkin-flavored products come out.  I was psyched to find this and immediately snatched it up.<br /><br />For the money it was definitely worth the buy.  It was delicious if you don't mind putting fake stuff in your coffee.  I am generally not a fan of the powdered creamers but I don't make coffee at home frequently enough to always have real cream on hand.  This stuff keeps in the cabinet.<br /><br />I liked that it was lightly sweetened, so I didn't have to add anything else to my coffee.  Don't expect it to be like a good coffee house flavor, but it's good enough for what it is.

review/summary: Made a great snack even more tempting!
review/text: I've been eating Loucks Sesame Snaps for as long as I can remember. I grew up in Canada, and they are sold at almost every grocery store up there. Whenever my Mom would allow us to pick out a treat at the checkout she would always encourage us to choose the Sesame Snaps. Anyway..., Memories. Recently I found these Dark Chocolate Snaps at my local grocery store. And Wow! I'm hooked again. MMMMmmmm. Listen, if you want a fat-free snack this is NOT IT! Super fattening, but packed with protein, and calories. I wouldn't recommend the chocolate snaps for hikes, or day trips on hot days since the chocolate will melt, but the plain snaps are an excellent choice for back pack food. These are simply an indulgence. They are a great alternative to the good old candy bar, (AKA "chocolate bars" in Canada.)

review/text: This is the second time we've purchased the De Boles Artichoke Spaghetti.  We buy the 10 lb. bulk.  I had to purchase it again because I gave a lot away to family and friends so they could try it.  Everyone loves it!  We've tried those wheat pastas and just hate them.  They taste like cardboard and no matter what sauce you add, it can't cover the taste.  This pasta cooks wonderfully and I've never had a problem with it sticking together.  I believe because of the very low starch.  This is a great product to replace those high carb, bleached flour pastas in your grocery stores.

review/summary: MY CATS ARE CHICKEN EATERS
review/text: I know all cats are different and well known for their finicky attitudes about eating. OF all the various foods I serve my guys, Chicken seems to be their favorite. Since I prefer white meat of chicken, not that this goes in my supper, I popped to buy it for my cats. (I am guessing that those types who do advertizing and sales are ever so aware that we want out cats to eat like we do.)<br /><br />But, in the end that is not the issue. Do the cats like it and eat it? And, quite frankly, the only way I can see that they like or dislike it is to see if they eat it. And do they eat it consistently? Or is this something that is not a staple in their diet, but something they eat once in a while?<br /><br />My guys eat this: and<br />1. the entire can is eaten<br />2. it is eaten every time it is fed and in its entirety<br />3. it is a staple in their diet. Even if they are given this daily, they eat it and eat it all.<br /><br />So I keep this on a permanent Subscribe and Save Rotation which mean I do not have to lug it fron the store. Also, Pro Plan has two more chicken entrees that are favs at our home: a. The chicken with the spinach in it cracks me up because I magine they must have seen old Pop Eye Reruns, but they love it!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007N30A16">Pro Plann, Pasta & Spinach Entree Adult Canned Cat Food in Gravy</a> and b. they always chow down <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OD8MPE">Pro Plan Chicken Tomato & Pasta Entree Adult Canned Cat Food in Gravy</a><br /><br />Mine were not crazy about the Chicken and Rice by Pro Plan. I do see that there is a Urinay Pro Plan available, but thankfully, we do not need it. But there are those who must have it, so I am pointing out that it IS available:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0LM2U">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Extra Care Urinary Tract Chicken Entr&eacute;e In Gravy, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>. AND, one more issue: my kitties are not crazy about beef or go through times when they do like it and times when they do not. Since I seek for variety since there are 5 to be fed, I am pleased, as are they, that a chicken with beef combo is out there too: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050CWRMM">Nestle Purina Petcare Pro Plan Canned Beef/Chicken in Gravy for Cats Pro Plan Beef/Chicken In Gravy 24 Canned Food</a>.<br /><br />So, the bottom line to this is YES, Buy this food and we have already indicated the others the kittys like, so you have several choices, but this is tops of the chicken list. Thank you. My kittys take their bow, and would gladly shake your hand on this recommendation!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Trinigy, Gabriella, Wisdom, Mercy, and Yellow Kitty.

review/summary: Dark and Rich, but Drink a Small Cup
review/text: There's a little place on Magazine Street in New Orleans that serves real Italian hot chocolate -- yum! it's thick, dark and just sweet enough to satisfy and replicate the European hot chocolate experience. Happily, California company "In Tempe Ran Tia" makes this treat readily available.  Creating a reasonable facsimile with a medium price point, this mix boasts of intense dark chocolate flavor that is easy to prepare and even easier to drink.<br />'<br />Caveat:  The only problem I had was I drank way too much -- a large 'Venti' sized cup that did not work well with my system the next day.  "In Tempe Ran Tia"  recommends a small 4 ounce cup which is about the size of a service in Europe.  So do comply with their recommended dosage.<br /><br />I had a bit of trouble finding the instructions for this mix - its hidden--printed in the box lid.  Follow carefully -- the mix contains arrowroot which allows the mixture to thicken after it has been properly blended.  For those who do not like sugar, this mix is sugar free--so sweetness can be adjusted to taste.<br /><br />The packaging is attractive --lovely violet ribbon and silk miniature sunflower adorns an orange/yellow reptile print box.  Nice!<br /><br />Bottom line?  Recommended for those who love dark hot chocolate, European style.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"

review/text: Most likely you've already had this and love it, but just wanted to buy it in bulk, as I did. I've read many reviews for bulk-shipped creamers that stated many of the creamers were smashed, cracked, etc. That wasn't the case for this one or the Hazelnut that I purchased. Both were double-boxed (the box the creamers were in were put in another sturdy box, to clarify), and there was air packaging in-between the top of the creamer box and the outer box. With both orders (180 Amaretto and 180 Hazelnut) I did not have even one cracked or damaged container. It seems they listened to all of those complaints and have fixed their shipping issues with these products.

I've tried a lot of different flavors of all kinds of nuts and even make my own spicy sweet pecans..but I'm not really much of a peanut fan. So, when I tell you these are some of the most delicious peanuts or really one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten...well, give them a try. I HIGHLY recommend them. HIGHLY...I want some right now. These are salty, sweet, spicy and crunchy...did I mention I want some right now. Try them, you won't be disappointed. :)

review/summary: Excellent price for organic maple syrup!
review/text: This is an excellent price for high-quality, organic, Grade B, Kosher maple syrup. It is 100% maple syrup, with no other additives. It is certified Kosher by KOF-K and is organically grown in New England. Grade B maple syrup is excellent for pouring on waffles or pancakes and is also tasty added to baked goods. It has a deeper, richer flavor than dark, medium or light grade A syrup.<br /><br />I highly recommend the seller, Swanson, whom I've had frequent dealings with. They have a large website and sell a wide variety of health products, both supplements and health foods like this syrup. They have always processed my orders on their website quickly, and the orders have arrived promptly, with no delivery problems.

review/summary: 64oz Now Grade B Maple Syrup
review/text: I purchased the syrup in order to fulfill the requirements of the Master Cleanse.  The cleanse is done at a minimum of 10 days which is how long I chose to do it.  The determining factor in my purchase of Now 640z Grade B maple syrup was the price!  $28.00 for a 640z bottle of Pure (Grade B) Maple Syrup is awesome!  It was shipped & received very quickly which made me even more satisfied!  Thanks Amazon for being on top of your business!<br />B.  Dague
