review/text: Ive never tried kc bar-b-q so i didnt know what it was going to taste like. When i finally got it i took one bite and eewwwww not the greatest taste.......not like any bar-b-q ive tasted. Jack links should take this beef steak off the market.......maybe ok for older people that cant tolerate hot food.....my older friend really liked it so i gave it to him. try the peppered beef steak by jack links its the best by far.

review/summary: Nice kick to it
review/text: I've tried the hickory and peppered so figured I'd try the cajun too since I like spicy food. It has a nice kick to it but it's not too hot, at least in my opinion. The spicy taste lingers in your mouth for a bit but it's not a hot burn. It's not as tasty as I'd like but overall it's good and I'll order it again. My favorite is the peppered though, great taste and just a little spice from the pepper.

review/text: This product is pretty good. With 26 or 27 grams of protien and low in fat, it is great for gym enthusiasts or people who want to stay healthy by eating healthy. I personally am a body builder and I'm looking to eat as much protien as possible everday. I definatly noticed an upgrade in performance in the gym and during the day when I take this. Although the cajun flavor is a tade too spicy for me at times. Like my eyes will get red and my nose will start to run. Other than that it is delicous. I will probably try the Teriyaki next.

review/text: Good brand.  They must pay their sales people a lot tho.  I saw these in stores for at least 50% more and convenience stores.... well, who has a wheelbarrow that big to haul around their change in?<br /><br />Send a lot of Jacks Link's steak strips and jerky to the American GIs in the Sand and found ordering it this way to be much more pliable and easier on your jaw than the same brand in Mart type or warehouse membership stores. If you send any to the heat like that, this is a much better product so there's a little time allowed to still have decent jerky arrive.  Steak strips and jerky are better liked than the nuggets tho..

review/summary: Try it in strip form and from somewhere else
review/text: I usually buy the Sweet&Hot jerky strips at Walmart and love the taste. I decided to try the 2oz stick from Amazon and was disappointed for 3 reasons:<br /><br />1. They came with expiration date only 48 days away. I've bought a couple of grocery items from amazon and this seems to be a common pattern. I've also read reviews complaining about the expiration issue on other Amazon grocery products. I love shopping from Amazon, but this reason alone may stop me from buying perishables from them again.<br /><br />2. These sticks are not nearly as soft in texture as the strips. Maybe it's because it's almost reached its expiration date?<br /><br />3. The flavor is not exactly the same as the strips. It tastes more or less the same as regular beef jerky. A bit of hot (as most jerkies are), but not much sweet. Again, is age a factor?<br /><br />I've tried many brands and flavors, and Jack Link's Sweet&Hot is by far my favorite. Get it in strips.. and get it from you local grocer.

review/text: I thought this was similar to the Jack Links Peppered Beef Jerky, boy was I wrong.  This stuff is like eating pure SALT.  Nasty as hell.  One package serving is 57% of your recommended daily intake of Sodium.  This is one of the highest content of sodium I've found in Beef Jerky.  I don't recommend this unless you really really like SALT.

review/summary: OMG...Are they really GF??
review/text: I've been GF for two years, and have tried several different brands of mixes, flours, and prepared foods. Nothing has even come close to how amazingly delicious these are. I added cinnamon and cardamom, and vanilla extract, but they would taste just as good plain. My daughter really missed having sand tarts, as they are her favorite cookie. She was in absolute heaven at her first hesistant nibble...she's a very picky eater, but she loves these.<br /><br />On the Bob's Red Mill site, they have recipes for variations such as snickerdoodles, and directions for how to use this mix as the basis for a cookie "cake".<br /><br />I highly suggest trying these, but be aware that they are meltaway soft, so they won't ship well. Be sure to follow the directions on the bag. I thought the dough was too crumbly and was about to add more butter, until I read the instructions. It is a dry, crumbly dough until you mix it by hand. Also, definitely cool them on a wire rack, otherwise condensation will ruin them.<br /><br />These can easily pass for a "regular" cookie...no one will guess they are GF!

review/summary: Used for G.F. gingerbread cookies - worked great!
review/text: Our daughter's school always has a gingerbread booth as part of their annual fundraiser and we wanted to offer a gluten free version for the kiddies, like our daughter, who can't have gluten.<br /><br />I figured this mix would be a great base to start with, as shortbread cookies are crunchy and often cut with a cookie cutter into a special shape. It did work great for gingerbread cookies with just a few modifications on our end.<br /><br />We followed the instructions exactly except that we used 1 whole egg, a 2nd yolk, and saved the extra egg white if the mix seemed too dry (it will indeed be dry as the instructions say, but if it's so dry that it flakes apart when trying to move it to the cookie sheet, absolutely add more egg white!) We then added an extra tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to alter the flavor to be more like gingerbreads. You can add powdered ginger if you want, however, our daughter prefers this milder "spice" recipe than when we add ginger, so we didn't use any.<br /><br />There was tons of positive feedback about the GF gingerbread cookies from both Gluten free folks and regular people - the recipe was a great success! We also thought they were incredibly tasty.<br /><br />Tip: ABSOLUTELY use the parchment paper when making these cookies! put it as a liner on the cookie sheet, also use it to roll out the dough on and also as a layer between the dough and the rolling pin. It made a huge difference! I've also heard that if you refrigerate the dough for an hour before rolling it out that it works better - we didn't try this though.<br /><br />So! whether you want to make G.F. shaped cookies for Halloween, the winter holidays, or whatever, this is a great mix to adapt!<br /><br />Happy Gluten Free Baking!

It is very crumbly when first mixed, but when you work it together with your hands is forms a ball that can be (very carefully) rolled out.  While getting the cookies cut and to the pan may be challenging (from simple bumps causing the uncooked cookie to break), once cooked and cooled (absolutely use a cooling rack), these are a wonderful treat.

review/text: I like Spaetzle.  They go nicely with many main dishes and are good in basic soups as well.  Bechtle's are cut very small, which makes them less of a plump, cushiony noodle like a true home-made spaetzle might be.  I thinik it is a matter of personal preference, but I tend to prefer a larger, longer noodle.  Noodles are to hold onto gravies and sauces and this one is adequate but not as satisfying as other brands.

As it turned out, I preferred the jar to the cubes. Well, next I was out of beef bouillon cubes and ran into the same problem. Same solution too. I bought the 7.9 ounce jar. It's excellent. Just yesterday I made a beef-flavored soup/stew and used the bouillon as a flavoring agent. Everything turned out perfect. This stuff has a real high sodium content, so I eliminated salt as an ingredient. The result was excellent!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: There is a nice mix of sizes, small and round or larger oblong, just like how the root looks. It is nice and meaty in the middle with some pieces having that very strong "bite" of hotness that ginger has. The crystalized sugar lightly coating the ginger helps take the zing out. I use this for cooking, stomach soother, or unique treat.

review/text: Tender and spicy crystallized ginger. It seemed a little expensive with the shipping--next time I'll get the 5lb box, I think that had prime shipping available--but this was well worth it. I used it in a molasses cookie recipe and it made some incredible cookies! Some of it may have been eaten straight from the bag during the cookie-making process and it was yummy on its own too.

review/summary: I LOVE THIS GUM
review/text: I have been chewing Peelu gum for many years and I really love it. The quality of the gum has always been consistently good when I buy it at Whole Foods and Mrs. Greens. I bought some online, not from an Amazon dealer, and the quality was not as good. So I can highly recommend this product when purchased from Whole Foods and Mrs. Greens. I love the peppermint and the spearmint flavors and the cinnamon is nice too. I really like that it doesn't have aspartame/nutrisweet (and all it's other names like phenylketuronics) as that gives me headaches. I also like that I can buy it in bottles of 100 or 300. It is a good product.

review/summary: If taste matters then skip this product
review/text: I'm an avid gum chewing person who has been trying to switch over to natural sugar free gum.  Initially I purchased this product due to the price being cheaper than it's main competitor spry.  What a mistake that was.  Actually this product is no cheaper after you spend 4.99 on shipping and also count in the additional time you have to wait for the product (4 -5 days) to be delivered.  The product tastes great initially but after about 5 minutes of chewing it tastes like crap. It leaves a very nasty after taste in your mouth. I'm forcing myself to chew it so I don't feel like I've wasted my money but it's not worth it.  The Spry gum tastes soooooo much better and it lasts.  Also I've tasted the variety of Spry flavors and they are all good.  So my final recommendation is to save your money on this product if taste matters. If it doesn't matter and cleaning you teeth is the key issue then go right ahead and torture yourself.

review/text: This gum is not worth the money.  There are far better Xylitol products out there for sale.  This gum's taste lasts less than one minute before it is spent and tastes like an old shoe.  Additionally, about the time that the flavor goes bad the gum turns to mush and does not even resemble gum at all.<br /><br />Most Xylitol gums that I have tried to not last that long but this one by far is the quickest to go south.<br /><br />I have had much better luck with others, you probably will as well.

review/summary: Better than any typical "just out of the cow" milk....EVER!
review/text: I first had instant whole dried milk when doing missionary work down in Honduras, CA. That dried milk happened to be either KLIM, a Borden product, or Nido, a Nestle's product. For all you dyslectics, you probably picked up on KLIM is just MILK spelled backwards......LOL.  I have had whole milk in the UK and even their full cream Jersey, gold topped, milk and thought that might be the best milk ever.  Matter of fact, I grew up in Houston, Texas and raised on a local dairy milk, Westmoreland.  During those days the very best milk was the one that was the creamiest and Westmoreland guaranteed that, as all their milk was from Jersey herds.  Peak easily surpasses that great "fresh" milk.  Not only does Peak taste great, not dried/instant, but it has the greatest milk taste ever.  I dare say that as long as I can order this stuff, I will never buy "fresh" milk ever again.  I am no longer a frequent milk consumer, but I do use it to make yogurt occasionally, on cereal, or even drink it, but rarely buy it as it typically goes bad/off before it is consumed.  Frankly, I do use it every morning in my coffee or tea.  I would recommend that it is made in a blender, chilled overnight, and then consumed.  I also have used half Peak and Sanalac powder to achieve a lower fat, but full flavored milk.

review/summary: You have to try it
review/text: I tried this based on my mother-in-law's recommendation. This milk powder is nothing like the nonfat milk powder that they sell at most grocery stores. You know what I'm talking about--the kind that tastes like powdered milk. Blech. This one is so rich and delicious. You have to use a lot of it to make a single glass, so it doesn't last very long. This is also great to keep at the office to use in your coffee where it's not always practical to keep a carton of milk.<br /><br />I can't emphasize enough how good this milk is.  This may sound strangely random, but when I first made a glass, I noticed my dogs intensely staring at me, hoping I'd give them some.  So I did.  They absolutely love it, too. They reacted to it as if it were the most delicious thing in the world.  They don't even react that way to steak. My husband even noticed and commented it's like doggie crack. I've never seen anything like it.<br /><br />It's also nice that you can control the richness of it by adding more or less powder.  I also tried the Nestle Nido milk powder that I got as a sample, and it is just as good.

review/summary: So many uses and yet so yummy!
review/text: I ordered this with several uses in mind, and keep finding more as I get more creative! I do not buy milk because I just don't drink it, however, this powder is the best tasting milk I have had since I was a kid! I decided that CoffeeMate is just alot of chemicals, so each morning I put a tablespoon or so of this into my coffee and it is heavenly!! It has vitamin A and D too! Any recipe that calls for milk, I just make the milk using Peak instant milk powder and water and presto! So convenient and it mixes in a snap. My latest kick is to make a milkshake (moderately low calorie) in a blender using the Peak milk powder, a few packs of Splenda, some water and ice and either some fruit or cocoa powder and a splash of vanilla! Delicious treat for under 150 calories. Satisfies that sweet/creamy craving I get. I used to eat ice cream and now I do this and I have kept off those extra 20 lbs. I lost without depriving myself of something I enjoy. This is so much better than the diet ice creams they sell at the grocery store, and no chemical additives! I cannot say enough good about this product. I highly recommend!

review/summary: Great milk to have on hand
review/text: We have tried several different brands of powdered milk recently to see which is the best for food storage.  This is very good tasting milk according to my husband - very creamy.  My ratio is different than the directions on the can as I did not want 3.5% milk fat.  I mixed 1/3 c. powder with 2 c. water (or 2 1/2 level Tbsp per cup water).  This probably made a very creamy 2% milk - more or less.  The directions on the can call for 3 heaping Tbsp. to about 6 oz. water to make 6.75 oz.  That's not even a full cup.  The can will make 3.5 gallons (about 56 cups of milk) using my ratio above so that equals $4.95 per gallon or $4.70 with subscribe and save option.  Not so bad considering.  However, if you use the ratios on the can it can be very expensive.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: I was skeptical when I was reading reviews but this stuff is awesome!! I don't drink much milk (mostly put it in coffee or cook with it) so the convenience of being able to make just as much as I need and not have to waste half a carton of milk is very nice. But more than that, this stuff actually tastes good. Not quite as good as Organic Valley fresh organic whole milk but definately as good as any regular whole milk or even Horizon whole milk. After you mix it up, it even coats the glass in the same way as fresh whole milk. But its powder, and instant. It tastes nothing like that nasty powder skim milk at all... it just tastes like good milk. It dissolves easily in warm water with nothing more than a quick stir. I haven't tried stirring it into cold water (the instructions say to use warm water) but I imagine it would take a bit more stirring. Anyways, I will definitely be purchasing this again. I have been searching for a brand of powdered milk to make  homemade instant cocoa and I think this may be the perfect thing.

review/summary: The best possible substitute for whole milk
review/text: My parents took us to live in Nigeria in the eighties and one thing we missed at first was having a glass of ice cold milk after school. That is,until my Dad came home from the university he was teaching at with a huge tin of Peak Milk,given to him  by a colleague who'd heard of our yearnings. It was perfect. For one serving ,just dissolve 2 heaping tablespoons of the powder in two ounces of water, mix thoroughly to get any lumps out then top up with another six to eight ounces of water, either hot or cold, depending on how rich you like it. Peak milk and Klim ( a similar product by Borden)were life-savers in Nigeria at a period in the nation's history when electricity was a luxury rather than a take-for-granted amenity.<br /><br />* It is a splendid pantry item in areas where power is spotty and you can't keep things refrigerated for long;<br />* With the rest of my family on vacation(without me,*whine*),I find that I may not always be able to use up the container of milk before it starts going south so this is great if you find that happening to you a lot. (I need sour milk for several of my chocolate cake recipes,but there's only so many brownies a girl can bake when the rest of the family is out of town...);<br />* It works wonderfully for baking and yogurt making. Just reconstitute according to package directions and carry on;<br />* One strange thing I noticed: like many adults of African ancestry I began to develop lactose intolerance as I grew older but I find that unless you are truly allergic, drinking reconstituted dried milk somehow has no ill effects on "the pipes". Go figure.<br />* You will find Peak milk in powdered and evaporated forms(better than Carnation by me)in most African and Spanish stores,in varying sizes. The size offered here is the Granddaddy and great bang for your buck.

review/summary: I wanted to love everything about these, BUT...
review/text: I am definitely in the middle of the fence regarding this product. :-(<br /><br />The good:<br />* Non-BPA packaging (as we all know, almost impossible to find for a plain tomato product)<br />* low in sodium<br />* not sourced in China<br /><br />Now for what I consider the downsides (other than the price, which may not be a deterrent to some).<br /><br />First, compared to the no-salt-added product I used to use (Del Monte Petite Cut Tomatoes, No Salt Added), I do think these tomatoes have FAR less taste. The difference is not due to salt content because the sodium content as given on the packaging of both products is the same. IMHO the Pomi tomatoes taste less "tomato-y" than what I used to buy (a friend who also tried the Pomi said she finds the taste "insipid"). But that is not my main gripe.<br /><br />The package claims 26 1/2 oz net weight (approximately, but close enough). However, a LOT of that weight is the watery juice from the tomatoes and thus I was unpleasantly surprised to see how little of that 26.46 oz is actually TOMATOES. So one day I took the time to strain the package and see exactly how much chopped tomato there is, versus their juice. The strained chopped tomato pieces were weighed on my electronic kitchen scale and came to 13.4 oz; the juice which was strained directly into a measuring cup came to just below the 11 fluid oz mark. Also, some of that 13.4 oz of chopped tomatoes also included a little bit of juice as well, since they were impossible to drain completely "dry". So this means that for the current price ($2.50 per box of Pomi at my local supermarkets) you are getting only about 13 oz of chopped tomatoes. That comes to about 19 cents per ounce. Hmmmmmm.<br /><br />This made me curious enough to invest in a "throwaway" can of my former choice, the Del Monte Petite Cut tomatoes which comes in a 14.5 oz can, to see how they compared. I strained it in the same manner as I did the Pomi. The results: I got 12 oz of actual tomatoes and only 2.5 oz of their juices. The can of Del Monte was $1.29 (at the same large supermarket chain that sells the Pomi for $2.50) which comes to 10.7 cents per ounce... almost half the cost of the Pomi if you are calculating how much actual chopped tomatoes you get for the money.<br /><br />I must also comment that the consistency of the Pomi chopped tomatoes is much "mushier" than the Del Monte petite cut or other typical canned ones ... in fact, IMHO the Pomi chopped is more than halfway to "sauce" consistency right out of the box, which is okay for some recipes but not good for others. The Del Monte diced served me perfectly in that regard but again... that darned BPA in their cans! :-(<br /><br />I really DID want to love the Pomi chopped tomatoes and if it was only the taste and the consistency that disappointed, I could probably learn to live with those shortcomings. However the realization that they cost almost twice the price for approximately the same quantity of ACTUAL chopped tomatoes compared to the equivalent canned product, is very frustrating especially in today's economy. Because I usually need little or none of the juice which makes up more than 35% of the package's contents, basically I'm paying a 90% premium for the non-BPA packaging.<br /><br />There should really be a better alternative but I've yet to find it. The few tomatoes in glass jars that I have found, have all contained spices (which I can't use, being allergic to garlic and onion) or have high sodium contents. Ideally, I wish Pomi would add a straining step to this product (which perhaps Del Monte does?) so that their package would contain more tomatoes and less liquid.

review/text: I discovered Pomi many years ago.  There are always a couple of boxes of this staple in my pantry.  I love the taste of the Pomi tomatoes in my Italian dishes.  You get 100% percent Italian tomatoes and nothing more.  There is something unique about these tomatoes.  Vegetables taste different depending on the regional soil in which they are grown.  Apparently, the Italian soil does something magical for tomatoes.  I much prefer Pomi tomatoes over the locally grown tomatoes.  There is no comparison.

However, it was cute to put into staged pictures of the dogs with the plastic bottles looking like they were hung over, along with their master!

This product has caused many dogs, including mine, diarrhea, vomiting, and seizures.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />My history with this product:<br /><br />My dog was very ill for 3 days: violent diarrhea and vomiting. Called vet after first day, they instructed me to keep him on a bland diet, and to bring him in if this persisted more than 3 days. Luckily, he got better and I didn't have to take him in. I thought, maybe it's just my dog and he has a sensitive stomach?<br /><br />I went to the web to research the product and found others had experienced the same thing. So I wondered...why is this product still on the market? I contacted Purina, and after no luck with them (who claimed they never heard of any complaints), I contacted the FDA, which currently has this product under surveillance.<br /><br />By the way, my dog is not a toy breed, he's a 20 lb. mutt. So say what you want to say about the latest 'not meant for toy breed' disclaimer on the package, he doesn't fall into that category.<br /><br />Sure, some dogs can tolerate this treat, but why take a chance on your pet's health and life?

Look for "cocoa mass" in the ingredients list if you want the higher iron there by the way as well as a higher percentage.<br />All these compliments being said for the current time I would advise one not to order the product here as the shipping cost kills the value.

review/text: Geewees, where do I start? First, I'd like to say that I have personally tried this Ojio brand, although I'm not a Verified Amazon Purchase and would recommend it over any other brand from all that I've tried, (The only one that comes close is Navitas Naturals). No, I do not work or represent the company but just wanted to share my opinion on a great product. The good thing is, the supplier sells direct through Amazon, so you don't have to worry about counterfeits or any funny business.<br /><br />Anyone can tell you that the main component for real chocolate is cacao powder. If you didn't know that, I bet your grandma did. We have this big misconception about chocolate and many of us have been raised to think that it is bad for you. This is mainly because of the high content of white sugars, synthetic sugars and dairy products that are in most chocolate candy. Whether dairy is beneficial for you is another subject all within itself and based on your personal research, understanding and belief system. The subject here is CACAO POWDER and although I am not vegan or on a 100% raw food diet, for many years now, I have been eating 50 to 70% raw food and cacao powder has been an invaluable ingredient to most of my homemade protein bars, carb bars and desserts. It is a fat burner, aphrodisiac, an energy booster (with low grade-slow caffeine release) and a great nutrient for the blood. This explains why women crave chocolate during their cycle. Check the internet, do your own research, it is remarkable. The most important thing is-- to consume it in combination with the right ingredients/foods that are healthy for you.<br /><br />Lastly, cacao powder contains a high volume of the amino-acid Arginine also known as L-Arginine (no other vegan source carries it in such high amounts next to rolled oats), which reduces healing time of injuries (particularly bone), quickens repair time of damaged tissue,  and helps decrease blood pressure. Most importantly, it is the precursor for the synthesis of "Nitric Oxide", a vessel dilator present in a lot of sex pill formulas and bodybuilder supplements. This is what helps men get that extra pump in every sense of the word! A scoop of this raw cacao powder should go into your daily protein drink and you can't go wrong.
