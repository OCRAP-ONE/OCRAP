review/summary: Excellent brew
review/text: This is the best coffee I've seen yet, and is excellent with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FMMTHU">Equal Zero Calorie Sweetener -New 800 Packets</a> and ordinary coffee creamer (I use French vanilla) for a simple sweet taste of perkiness.  I've just entered the world of coffee but have bought 20 different kinds of K-cups and this is my personal favorite.  I went through all the sampler packs - French Roast was the one I hated most - and found quite a few gems (blueberry, pumpkin spice, and white chocolate) but nothing that tastes "coffee-ish."<br /><br />As it turns out, the reason why I hated French Roast the most was because it is the darkest roast you can get.  Breakfast Blend is a light roast and the complete opposite of French Roast.  So if you hate Mcdonald's coffee and like non-dairy creamer this is the coffee for you.

review/summary: Unfortunately, this one didn't work for me...
review/text: I dislike writing bad reviews, I'm one of those people that believes that if you don't have something nice to say, you shouldn't say anything at all.  BUT, I am a tea reviewer and above all, it is important for me to tell it like it is, and sometimes that requires me to say something is bad when it is.<br /><br />And unfortunately, this Peach Matcha just doesn't hold up to the other Matcha teas that I've tried.  I've tried quite a few of Red Leaf Tea's Matcha (as you can tell by looking at the number of reviews that I've posted), and there have only been two that I've not enjoyed - this one and the apricot.<br /><br />Prepared traditionally using hot water and whisking, this is has a strong chemical taste that is really off-putting.  However ... and this Matcha's one redeeming quality which is why I gave it two stars instead of one ... if you make it as a latte, it ends up tasting much better.  The chemical taste is nearly gone (there are still traces of this taste, but it is very faint) and I can taste the peach and the matcha.  These flavors are also muted a bit because of the milk, but, it makes a nice, tasty matcha latte that tastes of matcha and peach.<br /><br />However, even though the latte was far better than the traditionally prepared Matcha ... I can't give it a higher rating because of that chemical taste.  I do hope that Red Leaf Tea considers finding a better flavoring for the peach and the apricot.  I had high hopes for them.

review/text: My first batch was a little too flavored, but Red Leaf was glad to replace it, which I am very thankful for. With the right flavoring, it's still not one of my favorites, but that could be previous memories of the taste. Peach blends well with the flavor of matcha, though, so it is a very enjoyable drink overall. Be careful with the temperature of water you use to avoid it becoming bitter, and definitely try it cold with just a touch of sweetener!

review/summary: Millions of peaches...
review/text: Millions of peaches...peaches for me! Millions of peaches....peaches for free! Yay! Flashback to the nineties, y'all. This time I've tried the Peach Matcha from Red Leaf Tea, and yum...it takes a bit of fiddling, but once you get it right, it is delicious. A welcome addition to any collection! And keep in mind that I'm still new to matcha and trying to figure it all out.<br /><br />As any good Southern girl would, I have a deep love in my heart for peaches. Deep, deep love. That fruity sweetness...is there anything better? There are few things in this life better than a fresh, juicy peach. A close second is ice cold peach tea. Peach cobbler, peach pie...summer is a good time to be in the South!<br /><br />I opened my package of this matcha and, my wife will back me up on this, my first words were "Whoa, momma!" It smells so good. Like juicy peach candy....nom. It smells painfully delicious.<br /><br />The taste certainly follows up on that scent! It tastes like a big, juicy peach lollipop. It's not a fresh peach, but it's a peach candy. It reminds me of the peach soda I used to get in high school at the local Food Lion to take to our weekly slumber party with my best friend. So I'm grateful for those memories. Makes me want to pop a big bag of popcorn and dip it in nacho cheese. Oh yes, we were super healthy.<br /><br />Anyway, this matcha has the same bitter kick as the lemon matcha, but a touch of sugar chased that away. I think that's just a matcha thing. It's definitely one I want to try again and see how it goes. Maybe cut it with a touch of the vanilla...peaches and cream! Yes please! This would be good in my smoothies this summer, maybe a peach raspberry smoothie dream...nom.<br /><br />I made a second cup with different parameters (12 ounces of water instead of 8 to one half teaspoon of matcha, as well as a bit more sugar) and it is heavenly. Juicy enough to satisfy this Southern gal! Finishing off my sample of this will be no great hardship, I assure you. It tastes like a fuzzy navel without the alcoholic bite! Or those peach gummy candies...yum!<br /><br />I let some of this chill and GAH. Cold, this is beyond amazing. This is what I needed, cold and fruity and peachy! It's not too sweet, it's not too bitter, it's just a beautifully refreshing cold drink for summer...I have a feeling this will be a staple in my cupboard this summer.

Previously I'd only buy it when visiting family I'm Europe, but then it hit me thatI could actually buy some online...for desperate times of course.<br /><br />This chocolate is amazing, and everybody I know loves it. I have to count on giving a third of my supply away to hungry friends who have not yet tasted the wonders of Milka.<br /><br />In short: delicious, perfect smooth texture, sweet and nutty from the little bits in there, and definitley a sweet to make everyone happy.

review/summary: Lost in Translation: Truth
review/text: This product is called "Hunmatsu-RyokuCha," in Japanese, and not the same as "Maccha" or "Matcha."<br />The translation for Hunmatsu Ryokucha and Maccha are actually the same, green tea powder.<br />However, the ingredient for Maccha is a special kind of tea called "Tencha," in Japanese, and has unique "Umami."<br />"Tencha" is grown in the shade in order to prevent the final product from developing certain astringent bitterness, called "Shibumi," in Japanese.  There are many kinds of bitterness.  i.e. For Maccha, it is not necessary true that bitterness is bad.  Actually, the first grade Maccha is more bitter than the low grade Maccha, given you are comparing amongst REAL Maccha powder.<br /><br />The process of producing REAL Maccha is much more complicated and painstaking than Hunmatsu-Ryokucha.<br />Hunmatsu-Ryokucha is ground regular Sencha Green Tea that are casually served all over Japan in regular household.  (Sorry, I am struggling with English.)  But one must understand that the kind of tea plants, the way they grow the tea plants, the way they process the tea leaves, are all different, not only in Japan, but also in any countries.<br /><br />(If you can read Chinese Characters...) Hunmatsu-Ryokucha consists of 4 Chinese Characters, Hunmatsu means powder, Ryokucha means green tea; however, Maccha sonsists of two Chinese Characters.  Maccha means special green tea powder intended for tea ceremony.  And we, Japanese, don't drink Maccha regularly.  Most Japanese don't know a lot about tea ceremony either.  (As most Japanese are not martial artists....)<br /><br />In the United States, Asian Grocery Store sells both Hunmatu Ryokucha and Maccha.  The real Maccha is usually in a nice tiny tin can, and the amount included is about 28g (about 1 oz), priced about 9 - 10 dollars each.  I don't think that any country but Japan produces Maccha, but I might be wrong.  However, if the green tea powder is produced in Taiwan, China, Korea,and other Asian countries, it is most likely to be Hunmatsu Ryokucha, NOT Maccha.  The same product sold at this vendor is much cheaper at Asian Grocery Store since you don't have to pay for S/H.<br /><br />The advantage of Hunmatsu-Ryokucha over Maccha is that the former has higher nutritional value, which I don't want to discuss in this site.  But the cancer preventing effect in this cheap powder is higher than more expensive Maccha.<br /><br />The disadvantage of Hunmatsu-Ryokucha over Maccha is of course, "Shibumi" (the closest direct translation is astringency.)  That's why you may feel it is more bitter than Maccha.  The powder is probably coarser than the Maccha.<br /><br />You may use Hunmatsu-Ryokucha for baking and dessert making, in the same way as you use Maccha. But the flavor and taste are definitely different.<br /><br />I have not tried Starbucks Maccha Latte.  But I assume that they use the low grade Maccha powder since, amongst real Maccha, the low grade Maccha is less bitter than the premium quality Maccha for tea ceremony, I heard.<br /><br />To conclude, if your purpose is to enjoy REAL Maccha flavor, you should not purchase this product.<br />But if your purpose is simply for your health, this product is better than Maccha.  However, you should research availability and cost comparisons of Hunmatsu-Ryokucha products by actually going to the Asian Grocery Stores.  You may get better price than this.  (Actually, I am pretty sure that you get better prices locally.)  Most Vietnamese owned grocery stores have Hunmatsu-Ryokucha in stock, not to mention Japanese and Korean owned grocers.<br /><br />Also, Hunmatsu-Ryokucha is popular in Japan, too.  Thus not all green tea powder imported from Japan is "Maccha."<br /><br />If you want to buy the quality Maccha, you should find the Japanese Grocery Store (owened by Japanese) and ask specifically "Maccha" for tea ceremony.  And if you are not satisfied, sign up for tea ceremony class taught by a tea ceremony master.<br /><br />For the seller, one must not include "Matcha" or "Maccha" in the descriptions or titles, if the product was just "Hunmatsu-Ryokucha."  As I wrote earlier, these two products share the same English Translation.  So you can say, this is green tea powder, grounded green tea, powdered green tea.  However, you must not even hint this is the same green tea powder that can be used for the formal Japanese tea ceremony.  Simply, if you call this "Maccha" or "Matcha," you are lying.  And you can be actually sued, and you will lose.  Not only this seller, but I find many sellers are falsely including "Matccha" or "Matcha" for non-MATCHA GREEN TEA POWDER.  So I believe this is just the innocent mistake.  I encourage the sellers to correct their mistakes, though.

review/summary: Excellent; A great alternative compared to Starbucks Green tea lattes
review/text: I purchased the matcha powder in hopes to replicate the green tea lattes at starbucks. Starbucks matcha powder contains more sugar than matcha, so i thought Id try creating my own. This product is amazing and tastes exactly like the green tea lattes. I chose not to add a syrup, but it would work very nicely. To have a similar green tea latte like starbucks i use this recipe:<br /><br />1 cup of hot milk separated (I use skim)<br />1 teaspoon of matcha powder<br />3 tablespoons of hot water.<br />Sugar/Splenda (optional)<br />Choice of Flavored Syrup (Optional)<br /><br />First disolve and mix the hot water with the matcha powder. Get all the clumps out before continuing. Then add about 3/4 cup of the milk to the matcha water mixture and mix to completely blend. Using a frother, froth the remaining milk until it resembles a foam. (I also purchased a small travel frother from Amazon) Add it to the top of the latte.<br /><br />Add sugar/spenda if desired.<br />Add syrup if desired.

review/summary: Bad Bad Packaging and Deceptive Photo
review/text: Wrote a review several days ago about the bad packaging and the deceptive photos. The seller contacted me and now, to all my surprise, my previous review is GONE! Absolutely outrageous.<br /><br />The taste is just average, not paticularly good nor bad. I have to be honest about this. But there are things that are just as important as taste when it comes to food.<br /><br />The green tea powder arrived in a small aluminum bag with a print-out label sticking to the back. The label looks like it came out of a home-printer. Not enough information are there on the lable, at least not the nutrition information which btw is required by USDA. What's even worse, there is no tin coming with the bag, while the photos clearly show a little green tin. I'd call it deceptive and misleading.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I would've given it 2 star if the aluminum bag was re-sealable, but unfortunately, it is not. I had to pour all the green tea powder into another tin. Not worth the $$$ I paid.<br /><br />All are my honest opinions. And please do save this one as my last review magically disappered somehow.

review/summary: Not that smooth, rather bitter, but OK in latte + good price
review/text: I bought the Taiwan tea and DoMatcha 2nd Harvest at the same time to compare. After mixing with hot water, I tasted them and was worried and disappointed because this Taiwan tea was very bitter. However, after mixing with sugar and milk to finish the latte, it was ok. Some of the even cheaper teas, like Culinary Teas brand, I could not stand without adding vanilla as well.<br /><br />This comes in a nice hard decorative cardboard box, and they even have a long plastic spoon. The color is paler than the DoMatcha (see photos). Given the price for 10 times as much, it is a good deal and I would not mind buying again.<br /><br />Tip: If your matcha clumps, try adding the tea to cold water, stir, then heat. Be careful as it can boil over easier. As with flour, if you add it to hot water there is risk it will form a lump. The bamboo chasen really helps to stir up the tea. They are 10 times better than a spoon.<br /><br />This tea is listed in several spots by VitaLife, Green Tea Powders, Simply Beautiful, Pier Mall, etc. It is really confusing having all these different companies selling the same product with same product images but different ratings and review pages.<br /><br />This is made in Taipei, Taiwan.

review/text: If you are looking to experience matcha, do not buy this product!  This product is common green tea powder.  Matcha is the result of stone grinding a very high quality tea called tencha.  Because tencha is shade grown, it is sweeter, less bitter, and has a much higher l-theanine content than regular green tea.  L-theanine is partially responsible for the feeling of well-being that real matcha produces.  For the details, look up the wikipedia entry for matcha.  This ain't it!

review/summary: Great taste and quality
review/text: I LOVE this product for daily use. Since buying this I have (gasp) thrown out all of the green and herbal tea bags I had in the pantry and now my entire family drinks this. It's so easy to make up fresh in a water bottle. A little bit of this, some truvia, and lemon juice, than add ice and water. I put the water bottle lid on and shake. I have instant, healthy, yummy green tea. It tastes better than brewed tea and is so much healthier. I read that adding this to HOT water will cause some nutrient loss. I am not sure if that is true, but since I prefer iced tea my method seems to work well.<br /><br />Also, some people cannot tolerate this on an empty stomach. I am one of those people. I grab a few handfuls of almonds, a cheese stick, or other protein rich food when I drink this and do not get sick. An apple or cucumber does not seem to do the trick unless I add something like peanut butter to the apple or ranch to the cucumbers.

This tea is a dingy looking, "pea green" and fairly bitter... whereas other higher quality more expensive brands are brighter and fresher tasting (the brighter the tea the BETTER quality it is).<br /><br />Although green tea is ingredibly healthy, you HAVE to be very careful about your source since manyof the poorer quality green teas (particularly those grown in China, Pakistan, and India) contain potentially high levels of metals such as fluoride, lead, and aluminum. Just FYI...aluminum in the body has been linked with Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br />So if your going to be consuming green tea on a *DAILY* basis, spend a little more money for some healthy and PURE green tea!

review/summary: Works for Me
review/text: I am not a green tea expert.  I bought this green tea powder because of the health benefits I'd experienced on my blood sugar with green tea leaves in bags.  The green tea powder is supposed to provide even greater results (higher EGCG).  I make a glass of this every morning with 8 oz. water and a little lemon.  I mix it in a shaker bottle and then pour it over ice.  It lowers my blood sugar by ten points every time.  You can read the reasons for this by searching online.  I also use it around meals (either before or after or both) for the same reason.  It moderates my blood sugar and prevents me from feeling drowsy after meals.

review/text: It didn't come in the package that I expected.  It was sent in a plastic ziplock with a printed information label.  End of the day it is hard to even know what your really got.  But then again I am not an expert of green teas.  For the price, I would say buy from a reliable source to ensure the quality and your expectations.

review/text: Color of matcha is much lighter than pictured....ie lower quality.  It's good if you want to add it to food, but not so good for a matcha latte.  I've read reviews, and it's true that you can't expect high quality for this price.  If the price is less than $20.00/4oz then it's not quality stuff. I thought I'd take a chance on it, but wouldn't reorder.

review/summary: far better than expected
review/text: i had bought this out of curiosity and thought it would be really bitter but was definitely wrong while i can not speak for everyone i can say that it is i guess bittersweet for me i did not put any sugar in and it has a far better flavor than the bagless leaf tea i buy from the Asian food store which i have to add just a tiny bit of sugar to so if you are the type to use very little sugar in tea just try it without first but i would have to say that this is excellent tea far better than bagged or bagless green tea

review/text: If you are a fan of smooth, earthy tasting green teas...then this one is for you!  The texture (once prepared) is similar to Chai tea, but I would say it definately has an "acquired taste" sorta vibe going on.  There is no other matcha, priced as well, for the amount you receive.  As an added benefit, this tea also helps to keep the waistline trimmer!  Good purchase all around!

review/text: The service and shipping was good and quick.  However, this is not the best matcha I've had.  It is a little bitter and requires more sugar to overcome the bitterness, and the color is not quite the vibrant green that a better quality matcha has.  The price is good, but I doubt I will buy this again.

review/text: I don't know how ANYONE can be critical of this stuff, especially @ this price.  Even in comparison to the highest quality of Matcha (which I've never tried).  If you drink that stuff stick with it if you want, but don't leave a bad review on here...  I'm not a big tea drinker but in comparison to most green tea in bag form or otherwise, this stuff blows it out of the water by far.  I've bought matcha before and this stuff is of similar quality to regular stuff that I bought at the store for 10 dollars an ounce.  Although I've never bought any of the more higher quality brand name products so I have no idea what they taste like.  What else can I say?  You get more of this stuff at a cheaper price than the bland tasting regular green tea, therefore no one can complain, EXCELLENT PRODUCT!

review/summary: Good for baking, probably not matcha
review/text: I use this inexpensive powder mostly for baking and it does a good job in green tea cookies. I agree with the other reviewers that this is mostly likely not real matcha. I have real matcha from Japan that I use for drinking in the traditional manner. I can taste the difference easily, plus this powder is from Taiwan. That being said, 10oz for this price is a bargain if you are using it in a culinary manner or for lattes or smoothies. The packaging is very nice and keeps the tea fresh and closed off. Just remember to put it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh longer.

review/summary: Worthy matcha latte
review/text: I can't weigh in on whether this is true "matcha", but in the Starbucks sense of the word, it makes a matcha latte which is just fine and I have enjoyed it this way every day a while now.<br /><br />Recently, I must admit, someone gave me some quality matcha from Korea (maybe this is the REAL kind) which I used for matcha latte, and the flavor is much richer, the color is darker, and the powder mixes up smoother.  The product for sale here leaves me some teeny clumps at the bottom no matter how well I try to mix it.  When I just taste the dry powder, I can taste the bitterness of this product, whereas the better stuff was not bitter.<br /><br />But the price is good and it's still worth what I spent.<br /><br />Update:  I bought a bigger package of "green tea powder" from an international grocery as another reviewer suggested.  However, the flavor is bitter, and much weaker - I use twice as much powder per cup and it's still not as flavorful, and it's more bitter so I have to add sweetener when I didn't with this product.<br /><br />Also, I found out that I can avoid the teeny clumps with this product if I pour my powder through a tea strainer before I mix it with the hot water.

Ordering here was simple, shipping was SUPER fast, the price was right, and the product is great.  I understand what people have said about the bitterness, but I think that is simply because there is no sugar added to this Matcha, which is not true of many commercial brands.  I have yet to make my cupcakes or try it as a straight latte, but I did try some on vanilla ice cream and it was great.  Refreshing and healthy!

review/summary: Beware of the CLUMPS
review/text: I love green tea.  I love matcha powder.  I will even admit to all the Matcha Powder snobs out there that I LOVE Starbucks Green Tea Lattes.  It's true.  I get them with Soy milk.  At least I did.  Until I realized that Soy milk isn't so good for you (that's another story).  So I ordered this Matcha Green Tea Powder to make at home with Almond Milk instead.<br /><br />It's good.  I won't lie.  However, it clumps.  I'm not sure if it's me.. or if it is the powder.  All I know is, if you purchase this, make sure you stir it like crazy.  Because if you get one of those clumps in your mouth, and it breaks, it's the nastiest taste I have ever experienced in my life.  The best solution I have found is to simmer it in a pot on the stove with the almond milk and whisk it.  It's a lot of effort, but it helps.<br /><br />Other than that, I like the matcha powder, it makes me feel full of energy and has a good even taste to it.

review/text: I tried this tea hot, but the flavor was very bitter and harsh, even with honey, stevia, and milk added. When I poured it over ice, however, it mellowed the flavor completely. I plan to add it to my morning smoothies and keep a little jar of it in the fridge to drink. I am drinking this for the health benefits, really, and not so much the flavor. I actually expected it to be much more bitter and hard to stomach - I'm thankful it tastes pretty good cold.<br /><br />As for the claims about it lowering appetite and creating lots of energy, I can say that any tea I drink seems to lessen my appetite a bit and this one does the same. If it's more than the others, I can't really tell. I do feel very alert after drinking a full glass.

For one thing, it makes a great flavoring ingredient in food and allows you to make your own matcha late at home.  It's also incredibly energizing and is a great alternative to coffee.  Ultimately, the price is right with this product.  I recommend checking your local asian mart first because I got this for 11 dollars there, but if you are really craving some matcha drinks, it's still a much better price for this at 2-something an oz than somewhere that's 10 dollars an oz.<br /><br />I have written a full review here:  [...]

review/text: I am trying to get healthy having a myriad of health problems, so I thought some green tea might be of use to me.  While I can't vouch for any miracle healing, I CAN say it tastes good based on what I did.  I used a spoonful of powder with the spoon that came with it and put it in my water bottle.  I added 2 packets of Truvia sweetener, and filled the bottle 3/4 of the way with lukewarm water and shook until the powder dissolved. I added ice to it, and it was really tasty.<br /><br />I will return in a month, hopefully with good health news.

review/text: Very green and mixes very easily, no chasen needed. Definitely has a good taste. It is packed well and includes a coffee-like bag with the powder inside of a very nice cardboard box. Included is a plastic spoon conveniently sized for portioning. I use this for green tea lattes and will use it for baking because its so affordable. For $3/oz its hard to beat the price.<br /><br />I previously purchased Maeda-En's Shiki Matcha (...) which is around $12/oz and it required a chasen due to difficulty in mixing and was slightly more bitter than I was used to. I've been to several tea ceremonies in Japan and the Maeda-En product tasted about right.<br /><br />However, this product by Vita Life seems to serve my purposes well (tastes very good and mixes very easily) but with my wallet in mind. I'm a very happy customer!

review/summary: Just like Starbucks with less sugar! Better at home
review/text: This is a great powder. It's my first time buying online and attempting to make Green Tea Latte's at home, so I wasn't sure. I didn't want to go with anything too cheap or too expensive. This powder will make a Green Tea Latte JUST like Starbucks. It is not sweetened, so I recommend adding Agave syrup or just getting the Torino Vanilla syrup if you want it sweetened. The great thing is that I don't have to make it as sweet as Sbux makes it and I can make it at home with Almond Milk.<br /><br />SOOO good. I will definitely buy again when I'm out. Great size and you don't have to put too much Matcha in there. It should last me at least a couple of months. Excited for tomorrow's latte.<br /><br />Store in refrigerator to keep it fresh.

I just use a couple scoops and dissolve it in water with sugar or honey, then I add organic vanilla sweetened soymilk on ice. Yay!

review/summary: Value Matcha that Delivers
review/text: I am new to matcha tea (this was my first) but I am very happy with Malden's powdered green tea. I bought it based on the other positive reviews and a little research, and was very pleased. Sixteen bucks for 1/2 a pound puts it in a league of its own. Most of the other matcha powders are much more expensive. I've been drinking it daily for over two weeks (even sharing it with others) and still have well over half of it left.<br /><br />Now if the matcha quality wasn't good then it wouldn't be worth it. After the sensory overload of my very first cup, I learned to prepare it properly and have grown to really enjoy the taste and extended "lift" it provides. It might not be "ceremonial" grade, but it blends well, has a lovely green color and has a bright, fresh flavor. Some people have said it has a fishy smell but I don't detect that. It is really more akin to freshly mowed grass. The added bonus is the health benefits associated with consuming the whole tea leaf -- win win!<br /><br />I highly recommend getting a bamboo whisk and proper matcha bowl, but for quick office preparation, some hot water in a mug and a small spoonful works fine. Just be sure to stir it up a lot, and re-stir if you let it sit for a minute or two. It isn't bad with a little vanilla creamer and honey/sugar in the raw either. Matcha may not be to everyone's taste, but for those that enjoy it, Malden's bulk Matcha Powder is hard to beat.

review/summary: Green Tea Shakes Yum!
review/text: This is a really good alternative to the expensive matcha that I have tried before. I used to work in a gym/smoothie bar. I wanted to make a shake that was similar to the one I would make at the gym so I bought this powder and I was very successful in doing so. This powder gives me energy all day and it is delicious. I do tell people that it does have a slightly bitter after taste but with milk added it is hardly noticeable.<br /><br />Here is a blender recipe I came up with<br /><br />1 Teaspoon of the green tea powder (First dissolve the green tea in 3 tbs hot water make sure clumps are out)<br />1 Small banana<br />1 Cup vanilla rice milk<br />2-4 drops Vanilla extract<br />2 Packets of Splenda<br />6-8 Ice cubes<br /><br />For a meal replacement I like to add 1 scoop of vanilla whey protein

review/text: This stuff is barely acceptable. I have some Starbucks Tazo Matcha powder and thought this might be a close match in flavor. But, it's really funky tasting. I'd describe the taste like a cross between grass clippings from a lawn mower and a really strong fishy taste. I know the Starbucks Matcha has sugar mixed in there but even still, with a pound of sugar and cream you can still easily taste that fishy flavor. I pretty sure I would not buy again. BUT, the seller shipped it VERY fast and there were no problems otherwise.

My only concern is that it is from China (I recall one reviewer suggest that Taiwan wasn't in China -it isn't on the mainland but it is part of China). I hate to say that but I am concerned about China's poor record of quality control ( not  Chinese equivalent of our FDA).

review/summary: Very Sweet
review/text: I bought these because the only ingredient listed was organic cranberries.  They are however very very sweet and I question the accuracy of the product label.  These are just as sweet (if not sweeter) than Newman's or conventional Ocean Spray dried cranberries.  The taste is fine, but I did not want to buy sugared cranberries.  Perhaps they really are naturally sweet, but I've never had fresh cranberries that were even slightly close to being this sweet.  Klein's website did not open for me and they do not offer a phone number so I cannot call to verify if sugar has been added or not.  I suppose I could write them!  They are labeled as USDA Organic.  A one ounce serving has 90 calories and 18 grams of sugars.  The other odd thing is that most dried cranberries have a little oil added.  There is a slight oily residue inside the container, but again, oil is not listed as an ingredient.  Does anyone know the facts on the ingredients for this product?

review/text: Saw these locally on an end of the aisle display and impulsively threw a box into the cart. We often eat packs of cheese crackers for lunch; this is a brand I hadn't tried before.<br /><br />The light colored crackers contain a generous amount of "cheese". They are very crunchy and flavorful, so much so that when finished I wanted to open another pack but resisted.<br /><br />Some things to consider:<br />The crackers are filled with "cheddar cheese flavored filling."<br />One package is 210 calories, 100 of which are from fat.<br />The sodium content is 370mg<br /><br />By comparison, a package of Lance cheese crackers has 190 calories and 270mg of sodium.<br />A package of Ritz cracker sandwiches has 200 calories and 440 mg of sodium.<br /><br />I wouldn't eat the Munchies on a daily basis, but for an occasional snack or lunch they are quite tasty.

I'd procrastinated and was afraid it wouldn't arrive in time, so I called and they promised to get it in the mail right away.  Showed up in 3 days.<br />The salt has undertones of clay, which gives it a deeper flavor and was used as a rub it the recipe.  The liquid smoke overpowered it, but the flavor was there.  I think it best used as a rub or finishing salt.<br />There is also black Hawaiian salt... somehow mixed in with lava!  Have to try that next...<br />P.S.  The salt was well packaged in a jar.

review/text: I instantly fell in love after taking a teabag from the box. Right away the scent hits you and just makes you think this tea will be very spicey and sharp.<br />Once it's made, it seems to have a warm "fresh baked" flavor to it but still a very strong (pleasant) ginger-spice flavor. Just make sure you only steep it UP to 5 mins. (I find that Sugar Cookie Sleigh ride can be steeped as long as you want, and only gets better. This one can get a bit too strong very quick.<br /><br />I was afraid to try it for the longest time, since I'm not a HUGE fan of gingerbread, but wow. I just ordered 6 more boxes and will keep it in my house forever!<br /><br />If you like spice teas, or even warm "cinnamon" type teas, Please give this one a chance!<br /><br />The only con to it is that I have never seen it in a store, even very hard to find around Christmas.

The Gloria Jean's tastes watered down to me. The hazelnut flavor almost disappears when I add milk. Timothy's holds it flavor even with half and half added.

review/summary: Worth buying again
review/text: This is the only flavored k-cup coffee I like enough to order again and again.  It's good enough that I choose it even when my husband has caffeinated coffee brewing in the next pot over.  I tried Green Mountain flavored k-cup coffee and didn't like any of the flavors much, even though I do like those same flavors when I get it sometimes at the local coffee shop, brewed not k-cup.  This is a mild coffee but the flavor is enjoyable and realistic.

review/text: I really like Timothy's k-cups.  The choices for decaf, flavored coffee is limited, and I was glad to find one that has such a great taste.

review/summary: JUST DELICIOUS
review/text: We have now owned a Keurig (actually three of them: home/business/RV) for almost two years.  We don't always drink flavored coffee, but when we do this is one of our very favorites.  As a rule, Timothy's brand is our favorite K-Cups in any variety.  Amazon offers one of the most competitive prices, and paired with the accumulated savings our Amazon Visa offers, we don't buy our coffee anywhere else!

review/summary: My Decaf of Choice
review/text: I don't drink decaf often, but now that I've found this K-cup, that might change. It's very flavorful and actually tastes like quality coffee. I liked it enough to "subscribe and save."

review/summary: Count on it
review/text: I've never run across a Timothy coffee - I use decaf - that has failed to satisy me, and this is no exception.  Plenty of body and a nice hazlenut flavor - I mix it with French or other dark roasts to get the strength I like, and I really don't mind decaf at all now since I've switched to premium brands such as this.

review/summary: Great Tasting After Dinner Coffee
review/text: This is a great tasting coffee for those who like to go caffeine-free later in the evening.  I like the hint of sweetness from the hazelnut flavoring, and the coffee has enough flavor to make the 10 oz. size without tasting watered down.

review/summary: Hazelnut Decaffeinated Coffee
review/text: I have purchased a Keurig Coffee maker this Christmas for my family who all like different flavors of coffee. We also have a Keurig at work and my company supplies another brand of Hazel Nut Decaffeinated which I drink daily. After researching K-Cup coffees online, I found Timothy's World and because of the great rating from users, I purchased it. Well, it is great tasting,flavorful and I enjoy it more than the brand we have  at work. I will continue purchasing this coffee for home and I recommend it for others to try. I can't drink caffein, but I am guessing that the regular Hazelnut is even more flavorful.

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: Coffee lovers have very individual tastes. Recognizing that, all I can say is that for me and my family this is the best decaf hazelnut coffee that we have found. For us it has a nice aroma and tastes great.<br /><br />Update November 12, 2009: This is still the best for us, and we have tried several others.

review/summary: Dirty confessions of a husband whose wife LOVES this coffee
review/text: Personally, I (the husband) perfer BOLD regular coffee, and I am constantly shoppoing around, trying different flavors from different companies.  My wife drinks mostly decaf.  We stumbled onto this Hazelnut Decaf brand from Timothy's many months ago, and she LOVES it.  So much so, that I am fearful of the day when she will report with glee that it is 'better than sex'.<br /><br />Being as I am always trying new coffees, and I am the one that orders our coffee since I am on the computer all day, once in a while I order her something different...<br /><br />BIG MISTAKE.<br /><br />While she would agree none of the others have been 'horrible' (I always read all of the reviews and get a pretty good sense from the Amazon gang before I pull the trigger), according to her, I've nearly committed the unpardonable sin.  She silently pouts until she runs out of whatever it is, but until then, meals become bland(er) and our sex life mysteriously suffers.<br /><br />SO I LEARN MY LESSON!<br /><br />...and I order her Timothy's Hazelnut Decaf...for a few orders...<br /><br />THEN I REMEMBER THAT I AM A MAN AGAIN!<br /><br />I'm bold, adventerous, and want to see what I can get by with...(similar to my ad on [...]) so I sneak in another order of something else...<br /><br />GARGANTUAN MISTAKE!<br /><br />The blood-curdling scream could be heard exactly at 6:20 AM downstairs.  I heard words that would drive a sailor wild with passion.  There is stomping, crashing, howling, glass breaking, and of course the scariest of all...the sound of the shotgun being pumped.  I'm trembling and scared to death and dare not look, knowing I will see her head spinning and green vomit flying everywhere.<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />So my dear beloved male friends out there in Amazon Reviewland, if your wife LOVES this coffee, be faithful to her and stick with it.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Faithful in Tulsa

review/summary: Very good decaf...
review/text: I drink coffee mostly at night now so I was looking for a good decaf for my Keurig.  I like this one the best so far, the hazelnut adds enough flavor that I don't even use sweetener any more.  I'm not a coffee connoisseur by any means, I just like something not too bitter with some kick.  This one fits my needs.
