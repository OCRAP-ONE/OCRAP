review/summary: Nothing wrong with these!
review/text: I was surprised to see that people don't like these.  I don't have kids, but I buy them for myself because they're gluten free.  I like that they're not too sweet, and relatively low in calories and fat compared to many bars out there.  A tasty snack to have around.  I'd like a little more PB flavor, but at least they're not loaded with sugar.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: I'm Gluten-Intolerant, so I'm always trying to find good-tasting foods that are gluten-free (hah).  These aren't too bad.  They are supposed to taste like Peanut-Butter Rice Krispie Treats.  They are much lighter as far as a "bar" goes - reminds me of eating those round rice-poof cakes.  They taste...decent.  The first part and last part of the bite is good; somewhere around the middle to end you get a funny taste.  No bad aftertaste though.  They are nice to have in case you get hungry and need to avoid stuff with gluten in it.  All I can say is give it a try and see if you like them.  I can see kids liking them a lot more than adults too.

review/text: Well, I have to put my two cents in since some folks have really been discouraging.  I love these bars!  And I particularly love this flavor--yes, I am a peanut butter fan.  I like that they are light and very much like a rice krispy bar.  I find them a good afternoon snack (I also love Clif bars, but sometimes I want something lighter, and quicker, to eat).  I wonder if the folks who don't like them (if they aren't a competitor) are used to more mainstream foods that overwhelm the taste buds with sugar and artificial flavors.  In any event, maybe you should buy a box before you buy a case... ;-)

review/text: I used to be able to eat granola bars, but when I became allergic to oats and gluten, I had trouble finding something to replace them with until I found these EnviroKidz peanut butter bars.  I really like them - they are not over-sweetened, don't use artificial ingredients, and don't have chocolate in them (another food I have to be careful about).  The best part is, they don't make me sick!  Thanks Nature's Path/EnviroKidz for making these yummy bars!  Don't ever change the recipe!

review/text: I buy these and the other flavors by the case for my kids. They make the perfect healthy grab and go snack. Not to mention they're gluten free, so they are great for kids with celiac disease, or a gluten intolerance of some sort. They can be pricey if you buy them at a store, but if you get them here at Amazon by the case, and with the Prime free shipping, they're a great deal. A case of them lasts quite a while between my two kids.<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthy smart snack for your kids, this is a great choice. I'm going to be a repeat customer for a very long time.

review/summary: A nice alternative to regular rice crispy treats
review/text: I was very pleasantly surprised at how good these are, especially compared to regular crispy bars. They have a nice peanut butter flavor that's quite tasty without being overwhelmingly sweet. My 7 year old finished one and then immediately asked if we could start putting them in her lunch or snack for school. They're also a good size, so I'll probably toss one into my bag for a snack on occasion also. One box of 6 bars is over five dollars at my local grocery store; this is an awesome price and I'll definitely be ordering them from Amazon from now on.

review/text: This is one of the first food items I found after being diagnosed with Celiac disease over 1 1/2 years ago.  It tastes great.  I have it as a breakfast bar, snack, dessert, and it's only only 110 calories (something I now have to watch due to weight gain).  Chocolate & Berry flavors are equally as good (if not better).  I typically buy these in bulk from Amazon; the price is comparable to what local retail stores are selling it for (i.e. Wegmans, Whole Foods, etc.).

review/text: These rice bars are so tasty.  They aren't too sweet and it makes me feel good that my child is enjoying a healthy snack.  Sadly, I enjoy them as much, maybe more, than my son does.  They're great to nibble for a midday snack or if you want to throw them in your bag for a snack on the go.  The bars are like a peanut butter flavored rice krispies treat, but with way better ingredients.  They sell smaller boxes in the supermarket so you can always try them out before getting this bigger box.  The value in the pack of 6 is there if you really enjoy the bars.<br />Don't judge me.  I'm a kid at heart.

review/text: Read the reviews here with a grain of salt.  A couple of people thought these were "awful", but I don't.  I purchase all three flavors and eat whatever I'm in the mood for, and I enjoy all of them (chocolate, pb, berry).  Bottom line, try a box purchased locally, and if you like them, buy them by the case at amazon for their cheaper price.  My only complaint is that Amazon grocery doesn't consistently carry the chocolate flavor.  If Amazon grocery is to thrive, customers need to know they can find the products they want to buy on a consistent basis.

Not a lot of chewy-ness to these either, just big pieces of rice and very little chewy texture.  The berry variety of these seem to have great reviews, stick with those ones if you HAVE to try the Crispy Rice Bars!!!!

review/summary: Kona instant coffee
review/text: My husband and I enjoy the taste of the Kona coffee but I was surprised at the size of the bag, too small for the price. I purchased a Kona jar from Hawai 1.5 OZ for $5.99 vs 1.75 OZ for $13.95. This will be the last time I order the Kona freeze dried instant coffee from Amazon.

review/summary: This is Decaffienated???? I can't believe it!
review/text: After living in Italy for half my adultlife, caffe' IS a necessity. After trying for years to replicate the crema (the wonderful caffe' essence that colors the top of the espresso), using Starbucks premium stuff and grinding it at home--I couldn't replicate the right grind or taste of Italy in a cup.<br />Enter Lavazza. While I love Ily Caffe, Its ridiculously expensive. Lavazza red combined with my new DeLonghi machine (79.99 on amazon) have not just reinvigorated my mornings, its brought the best years of my life back with amazing taste. I even come home at lunch and look longingly at my machine. This decaff allows me to have a latte or authentic cappucino in the afternoon (no-no in Italy, I know) too. Or evening before I go to bed.<br />Lavazza products make the good life possible (that & my deLonghi!)<br />buon appetito!<br />tj

review/summary: Sadly Let Down
review/text: I'll start off by saying that I will not purchase this coffee flavor again.  I thought mocha sounded lovely, but I was disappointed.<br /><br />Normally I check all ingredients before buying, but I forgot on this one and after I had some,  I realized there were artificial flavors.  What a pity.  Tastes like it, too.<br /><br />To me (and hubby) this coffee tastes like it was sprayed with a bad, dollar store perfume.  There is a slight mocha flavor, but it is so fake tasting that it's rather gross.  Adding a little milk helps make it more palatable, but I wouldn't call it tasty.<br /><br />The only good thing about the Mocha Eight O'Clock Coffee is when it is brewing, the whole kitchen smells like a gourmet coffee shop.  So, I guess it's a good room potpourri...<br /><br />I don't recommend it simply because of the usage of artificial flavors that TASTE artificial.  Other varieties without such artificial-ness are better.  The coffee brand itself isn't bad, but this Mocha flavor is.

review/text: Admittedly, I'm already a fan of Eight O'Clock Coffee... it's 100% Arabica and reasonably priced.<br /><br />This mocha version didn't disappoint... but... it wasn't exactly as good as I was expecting.  The mocha flavor is really nice, but the overall drink it made seemed a bit weaker than what the regular coffee would make with the same number of scoops.  What we ended up doing with our drip machine, is use a mix of half mocha and half regular.  This still imparts the great mocha flavor while making the coffee more "robust."<br /><br />I will be buying this again!

review/text: This is the first time that I have purchased anything from Cat Cora's Kitchen by Gaea.  I will definitely purchase them again.  The taste is excellent.  They taste better than all the other pitted olives I have bought in the past except they have a little bit softer texture.  The resealable pouch is a nice plus.  It seals good and they stay fresh and soft without drying out at all.  So far the only complaint that I have is that I can't stop eating them once I open up one of the packs.  :-)

review/summary: Tastes OK but olives had pit fragments & one package had moldy olives!
review/text: The taste of these olives is OK. They taste like Greek olives and are a bit soft. Unfortunately, I think they are far too greasy & oily. The oil does not taste like a high quality olive oil. Moreover, the first package had a large number of pits fragments that were small enough not to be seen but large enough to damage teeth and dental work. Overall, 2 stars for my first bagged serving.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my experience with these olives took a turn for the worse. Upon opening the second bag, I noticed that there was white residue and spots all over the olives - a picture is posted. I'm guessing it's mold. It could be due to a package that was never fully or properly sealed, or it could be due to the manner in which Amazon stored them, or perhaps a combination of the two. Regardless, it's simply unacceptable to open a food product and find it in this condition. I would give it 0 stars now if I could.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, I don't recommend this product. I previously tried the green olives from this brand, which were great, but I won't be repurchasing anything from the the Cat Cora by Gaea brand again because of this experience - that includes previous purchases of olive oils, green olives and tapenades. Moreover, this is the second time I've received moldy, white-spotted olives from Amazon. The last time it was the Byzantine brand, and I hoped switching brands would rectify the problem. Unfortunately it didn't, so this is also my last olive purchase from Amazon.

review/summary: The Perfect K-cup, 40 Years in the Making
review/text: First of all, yes, it is expensive.  Though currently at $59.99 for a 54 ct, the price is not part of my review.  I'm sure it'll come down eventually.<br /><br />I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now.  As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend.  Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill.  I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1.  The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor.  2.  I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place.<br /><br />There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago.  It is THE perfect medium blend.  There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers.  It's bright, but not too bright.<br /><br />Does the K-cup version do it justice?  Yes.  Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup.  I just got home with these an hour ago, and 3 cups later, I can honestly say my prayers have been answered.<br /><br />You know what?  Even at $59.99, this review would be 5 stars.  It's that good.

review/summary: Best of the Best
review/text: I have loved the taste of  Pike Place Roast coffee since its first offering. I have a special affinity to Pike Place in Seattle, and this coffee has a particular taste that brings me a sense of the place. It is robust with a flavor of  cocoa and toasted nuts. It is subtle with a smooth body. As an aside, Starbucks opened  their first store in the Pike Place Market in 1971.<br /><br />When I received my Keurig, I hoped to find Pike Place K-Cups, and that was one of my first purchases. The coffee has the exact flavor and is so delicious! It is so easy and convenient to order from Amazon. I look forward to my first cup of coffee each morning!<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-22-12<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520269926">Everything but the Coffee: Learning about America from Starbucks</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0069AFIN4">Starbucks Pike Place Roast, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 54-Count</a>

review/summary: Good, but not Great
review/text: I live near Seattle and have drunk "Pike's Place Roast" at the Pike's Place location many times. So I know what a good cup of it tastes like. I'll also say that my expectations are higher for a k-cup that sells for a premium price.<br /><br />The coffee these k-cups makes is good, but not great. Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a "Bold" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special. To my tastes, there are plenty of better k-cups for less money. Not worth the extra cost and a little on the weak side. I'm giving it three stars, but 2.5 stars would be about right

review/text: This is the perfect medium roast K-cup. The coffee never tastes burnt or watered down. It tastes just like it would if you ordered it at Starbucks. This coffee is just as good as the French Roast, but not as strong. I will continue to buy these as they are the best K-cup I have tasted yet!

I was so elated when I found out that Starbucks was now going to be in Keurig form, let alone this flavor.  I normally can not stand coffee with cream and sugar.  I enjoy my coffees, black, no cream or sugar, and STRONG.  This one is the lone exception.  Starbucks claims this is a medium roast.  Take it with a grain of salt.  It has a fantastic aroma but a bitter taste, with also a bit of an aftertaste.  The first time I had this at a Starbucks, I wanted to throw this out.  To be honest, it was nasty, but with the price of a Starbucks coffee, at their coffee shop, I refused to give in.  I added (2) packets of sugar, along with some half & half, and "Oh my God", I was in heaven.  I should say, this is for an 8oz cup.  Not only is this so good, it's actually my favorite coffee.<br /><br />Now with the K-Cup version... to make the equivalent, I select an 8oz brew, use half & half to where it's a medium brown, and (2) packets of Splenda.  Splenda, in coffee tastes as good as sugar.  I'm diabetic.  This tastes as good as if it was from their coffee shop.<br />Since this can get expensive if your going to have more than (2) cups a day, I've decided to purchase this in 1lb bags and use the "ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers", to make this more cost effective.<br /><br />The bottom line is I think if you, like me, don't like this coffee, by itself, try it with cream and sugar.  You'll be surprised at the difference in taste.<br /><br />By the way... why this says I'm in New Caledonia, I have no idea nor can I get it to change.  I'm from NJ.

There was no packaging inside the box to hold the k-cups in place and protect them, they were just laying in the box loosely.  Some of the cups in the box were also damaged, probably due to the lack of packaging in the box.  This is not the quality anyone would expect from companies such as Keurig and Starbucks!  I suspect the box has been opened previously.  I do not know what happened on the sellers end, but what they sent out was not an original new package of keurig k-cups!  The cups seem to be authentic, but it is hard to tell since the packaging was not up to par and even though the box was sealed, it is looks like the box has been opened previously.  The product I received was sold by "BECCO CORP" through amazon.

review/summary: Mediocre Flavor & Brew, Not StarBucks Quality!
review/text: In 2011, when StarBucks broke away from Tassimo Bosch over a contractual dispute, I was completely disappointed, and wondered<br />what other Options were going to be available, in the meantime, I purchased a warehouse supply of StarBuck's Coffee & Cappuccino and<br />started researching a New Coffee Machine, and then ... in November, I found out that Starbucks was offering the "K-Cup" Version, for the Keurig Coffee machines. I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances.<br />When I returned back in this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />* Pike Place + Colombian + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.<br />  The Colombian was the Best of the lot.<br /><br />Read my comments, after each bullet item:<br /><br />  * Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about<br />  2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig "Brew" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!

The good news: it doesn't taste like the Olbas pastilles.  The bad news: because it is instant tea, the herbs have been processed with sugar and transformed into little granules.  That was a surprise and I would have preferred something without sugar.  That said, it is a pleasant drink and soothing when one has a stuffy nose.
