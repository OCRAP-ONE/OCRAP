review/summary: Terrible tasting tea; also contains citric acid
review/text: Unfortunately, I found this tea to have a simply awful taste.<br />I did not mind the box haphazardly-crammed full of 100 tea envelopes, but the tea itself has a nasty bitter taste--I have used lots of different kinds of ginger teas, so I believe I know how ginger tea should taste.<br />I was surprised to find that one of the ingredients is citric acid, though I don't understand why they would include that ingredient in an herbal tea.

review/summary: Which is more important?  That it be decaf or taste like chocolate?
review/text: I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a> has a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.<br /><br />If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64F6">SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY03TC">Bigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.

Mild bright mint with a slight kick of ginger.  I like it hot or cold and very lightly sweetened.  Have used sugar, honey and agave nectar with success.  Doesn't need alot of sweetener to enhance it.  I've had to start ordering in bulk as it is a year round tea for me and I've gotten several friends and coworkers addicted to it:lol:

review/summary: Poorly packed
review/text: The tea was smushed into the box so badly that a couple of the individual wrappers were damaged and bust open. The box itself had a hole in it. I had read other peoples reviews that said the same. It was so poorly packed I wondered if it was even legit or if someone had just cleaned out their cupboards and stuffed all of their leftover tea bags in a box. Anyhow, I found the double spice too bitter so I won't probably buy it again. The 100 ct Stash tea probably won't tempt me again either due to the careless packaging.

review/summary: Passable but not fantastic
review/text: My wife will tell you that I am a tea snob.  This is an okay breakfast tea, but I'm not in love with it.  It's also not terribly expensive.  It is convenient.  I usually take it with some milk.  It tastes good with milk.  The tea is slightly bitter, not very flavorful, nor memorable.  I have tasted English Breakfast tea by Strand, Adagio, and a couple others.  Adagio's is my favorite.  This is good if you it's the only thing handy.  It's not bad, but it's not good, either.<br /><br />I noticed a few people thought this review unhelpful.  Sorry about that.  I can't recommend this tea.  Maybe you will like it.  If you do, don't go tasting other tea because you might realize how truly mediocre this one is.

review/summary: Tea Bags are all thrown into a box and get crushed, otherwise a good deal.
review/text: This is a good deal moneywise, but the bags do come all thrown in a box.  I thought there would be more protection for them or they would be stacjed in some way they don't move around.  I had to take all the bags out and flattened them.  So if you are buying them for food service and are presenting the bag in some way, you may just want to buy the boxes.  I thought I could be more green buying just the bags and putting them in boxes I already had, but now I would buy the six box version of this instead, because I don't like tea bags that are all creased up when I bought them new.<br /><br />The teas I bought this way are good, they get a 3 for how they were just thrown into the box though.  Couldn't they have used a smaller box and lined the bags up in a way they didn't move around?  They ended up with some tea bags fine, others almost in a little ball in the middle!<br /><br />The tea is refreshing though, not high on the mint, but it's great for a summer's day!

review/summary: Not terrible, but...
review/text: Not terrible, but not anywhere near as good as the Tazo Organic Chai tea bags. Now, you can't beat this price (on the 100-count bulk box), so it still may be worth the compromise in quality. I will say right now that I will likely not buy again and I will try to find the Tazo Organic Chai at the best price I can--which I will still pay even if it is double or triple what this is. Or perhaps by the time I go through 100 bags (50 mugs worth--the Tazo only needs 1 bag, the Stash needs 2) this will grow on me. I recommend honey as the sweetener for any unsweetened chai.<br /><br />The packaging is fine, by the way--except now owing to the complaints they use too much. It's still the same plain box with individually-wrapped teabags stuffed inside, but then that's placed in an oversized box with too much of that air-pack cushion that Amazon uses. This is the bulk size box, so don't expect a box that looks fashionable on your kitchen counter.<br /><br />Lowered rating from 3 to 2 after I found the Tazo at a decent price. See the comments.

review/text: I've pretty much tried all the bagged Chai tea commonly available and this is without a doubt my favorite.  I'm diabetic so I sweeten it with "Splenda", then add a small amount of Vanilla Soy Milk and the flavor and smells take one to a different world.  I'm buying this in "bulk" so I certainly don't expect high-quality packaging as some seem to think there should be. This is a huge savings over buying it retail at my grocery store and as I use at least three bags a day I am absolutely pleased to buy in bulk.

review/summary: THE BEST PEPPERMINT TEA EVER...!
review/text: I had to quit coffee cold turkey due to PCOS, and this tea is getting me through it.  It is recommended for females who have PCOS to drink approximately 6 cups a day for full benefits.  I was able to do just that with the Stash-Amazon subscription program.  I love it with a little non dairy creamer and sweet-n-low.  It has a wonderful aroma.  when you open the individual tea package, you can swell the wonderful peppermint aroma.  The other great thing is that Stash actually recommends that you double steep their bags (3-5 minutes).  I did at first, but I no longer do, I want a fresh bag every time. This is some great tea, and everyone who is around me when I drink it; always asks me what is that, it smells so good. I have went to other stores and tried to buy variations of peppermint / mint teas, and none of them even come close in comparrison to this tea.  it is a must buy!

It's a good balance with the white tea.  I have a small 4 cup drip coffee maker and put 2 bags in the filter basket and about 2 T sugar in the carafe and end up with a few great cups of tea.

review/text: This one will put a pucker on your lips and a smile in your heart.  I have found a new tea to love, especially if it is iced tea.  I do not use any sweeteners and none is needed.  The tastes and aroma is outstanding.  This has to be the best Stash tea I have tried.  I will keep coming back for it as long as they sell it.  If you like lemon, you will love this tea.

review/summary: Excellent Mint Green Tea
review/text: Once you've tried high quality tea, it's hard to go back to the free tea at your office. Stash is worth the extra money in my opinion. The tea is very "fresh" and not powder-y, like cheaper teas. I drink some variation of mint tea every day and this is one of my favorites. (Steven Smith teamakers is my very favorite, but it's much more expensive.) The 100 count box is generally not much cheaper than the 6-box pack, but I appreciate the convenience of less packaging.

review/summary: This was my favorite tea!
review/text: This was my favorite tea.  If you like Moroccan mint, you'll LOVE this.  The flavors are strong and perfect without a hint of bitterness, and it's organic to boot.  I especially love the spearmint.  Yum!<br /><br />The bags came squashed together and wrinkled badly, which is something to consider if you plan on serving these professionally or making gifts, but not a single bag out of the hundred was ripped.<br /><br />I say it "was" my favorite tea because it has lemongrass in it, and I have a food allergy to all grasses.  If you're allergic to wheat or have an environmental grass allergy, you may want to check with your allergist before buying a hundred of these.  The flavor can't be beat, but I'll be going back to brewing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4F1QS">Stash Premium Decaf Premium Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> side-by-side with herbal mint tea whenever my allergies are flaring up.

review/summary: Very Tasty for a Decaf!
review/text: You can still get more flavor in a fully caffeinated green tea, but this is green, clean, and refreshing.  It is not at all bitter as long as you pull the tea bag out in 1-2 min, and it has forgiven longer steeps as well.  The flavor is warm and mellow with some grassy tones, but the grassy tones are not overwhelming.  Light, all-day tea that's good cold as well.  I'll sometimes put a bag into cold or room-temperature tea to flavor the water deliciously without adding heat to a summer day.<br /><br />I often mix this with other flavors to cut the caffeine in half, or mix it with other decaf flavors (like herbal mint) for variation.<br /><br />Be advised this box came with the tea bags smashed in pretty densely.  The quality wasn't compromised, but they would make for poor gifts and their resell appeal would take a hit.<br /><br />As with any 100-count box, I recommend picking up a single box of this at a local grocery store if you can before committing to so many.  It's available at most of my local grocery stores, and might be available at yours as well.

review/summary: Flavorful Tea with Hibiscus Flowers and Some Flavorings
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me---but everyone should know this in case they are allergic. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and don't mind a few additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />This 100 count box is an economical way to enjoy this tea; however, I would try it first in a smaller quantity to be sure before you go for bulk!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Delicious and Fruity
review/text: This is a delicious and fruity Oolong tea.  It has a delicate coconut flavor with a nice hints of fruity mango.  I love it black with just a touch of agave nectar, though really it's quite a sweet tea and doesn't need any at all--but I have a bit of a sweet tooth.<br /><br />A note on packaging:  While it did not affect my overall rating, don't expect to be sent one of the large rectangular tea boxes in the picture.  My order came loose in a small cardboard outer box.  I'll have to take them on their word that it's 100 tea bags, because I'm not going to bother sorting and counting them!  Some of them are, as a result of being packed into a very tiny box, flattened and dog-eared.  If presentation for guests is important to you, you may want to rethink purchasing this bulk amount, and buy the individual boxes instead.

review/text: The flavor here screams tropical.....and its lovely.<br /><br />I like this tea sweetened...as the sweetner really brings out  the flavor of the coconut and the mango.<br /><br />Talk about island flavors !!!<br /><br />It dosen't get much better than this...it'll bring you back to the Bahamas or Puerto Rico or your favorite island any time you want to remember the Carribean.<br /><br />One of the top points for me are the box that these come in....I have tried  several forms of tea chests and of course we all have 20 boxes of different flavored teas around the kitchen. I l prefer the cardboard box these teas come in because its better for storage.Easy to get to and handle and store...but I can still throw a few into the tea chest so visitors can claim their  own choices.<br /><br />Of course if they ask me ---this would be in my top three choices.

review/summary: Not for fans of English Breakfast Tea
review/text: This product seemed like an excellent value for decaf English Breakfast tea.  Unfortunately it bears no relationship to any English Breakfast tea I have had in the past 40 years.  I will be returning to paying much more for Twinings.  This Stash product is considerably more like standard black tea than like English Breakfast tea, and if you want decaf black tea that is stronger than Lipton decaf, this is a good choice.  But if you were looking for a smooth, premium-quality English Breakfast tea, this is not it.

review/text: Stash Premium Chocolate Mint Wuyi Oolong Tea is my new favorite!<br /><br />I usually drink my tea strong with whole milk and raw sugar or stevia.  This tea has a nice smell and a smooth taste.  I am mixing it with PG Tips black tea to add a bit of strength and boldness.<br /><br />Very pleased and am thinking my 100 ct box will not last long!<br /><br />*****UPDATE*****<br /><br />The mint taste really tends to overpower the chocolate.  However, as I said originally, I mix it with black tea and it turns out pretty well.<br /><br />One thing we found we like to use instead of sweetener & milk, is to use Vanilla Eggnog to sweeten & cream.  Yum.

review/summary: Another Great Tea
review/text: Smooth and tasty--Caffeine free herbal tea-- 100% natural ingredients (in the order listed) are: peppermint, chamomile, spearmint, organic tulsi, lemongrass, guava flavor, cinnamon, and grapefruit flavor.<br /><br />As usual, each tea bag is sealed in its own foil package to keep the flavor inside and ready for you.  I use 1 bag per 24 oz hot water.<br /><br />This sounds like an unusual mix of flavors but it is quite tasty--kind of like a minty fruit.  This would also likely make an excellent ice tea.<br /><br />If you want to add a sweetener, I prefer a natural sweetener, such as agave cactus nectar (natural food isle of food store), or unbleached brown sugar (sugar isle) or honey.

review/text: This is a good deal moneywise, but the bags do come all thrown in a box.  I thought there would be more protection for them or they would be stacjed in some way they don't move around.  I had to take all the bags out and flattened them.  So if you are buying them for food service and are presenting the bag in some way, you may just want to buy the boxes.  I thought I could be more green buying just the bags and putting them in boxes I already had, but now I would buy the six box version of this instead, because I don't like tea bags that are all creased up when I bought them new.

review/summary: Stash brand tea my all-time favorite
review/text: I checked my past orders of the Stash brand Earl Grey Double-Bergamot tea. It seems I order about once every 8 months. This is now my 3rd order but the first time I bought it in bulk like this. The savings were minimal but worth it. I made sure to count all the bags to ensure a complete order was received. It was.<br /><br />I was surprised to find a video by someone who spoke of Earl Grey as a vile and disgusting tea. I love this tea. However, I have met people that I have offered a cup of this tea, and a few have mentioned it smelled like pepper to them. Bergamot, the predominant spice in this tea, is a citrus not unlike an orange whose oils are extracted for this tea. When I smell the tea, I smell a sweet aroma. If, when you smell this tea, it smells like pepper to you, you might first give it at least one sip before dismissing it. I typically put cream & sugar in my this.

review/text: I'm not a tea connoisseur, but I do like what I drink in the morning to have a subtle and recognizable flavor with floral overtones. How's that for specific? Stash Premium Jasmine is just that. It's not a rare Chinese blend picked at high altitude by retired gymnasts, it won't rock your taste buds with complexity and depth, but it won't decrease your net worth by much, and will go very well with your bran-laden muffin. It's pleasant, clean and quite drinkable. Enjoy.

review/summary: Great if you like Wintergreen
review/text: Although I do not care for this tea much, I still give it four stars. That is because it is the only tea I can force down that has wintergreen in it. I often buy teas that are a mixture of green and/or white tea with spearmint and/or peppermint. It was my fault I did not read the description carefully, as I did not realize it had wintergreen in it until I tasted it. You can definitely taste the wintergreen!<br />My favorite Stash teas are the White Christmas, (white tea, peppermint, & ginger), and the Moroccan Mint, (green tea, spearmint, lemongrass, & peppermint). I do the White Christmas if I want something a bit spicier and more warming, and I do the Moroccan mint when I want something a little smoother. Due to the lemongrass it does taste a bit grassy, but it's still good.<br /><br />If you want a good mint tea without green, try the Cascade mint. It just has peppermint and spearmint, and is absolutely delicious! I mix that with decaf green in the evenings and it's wonderful! Unfortunately, I have not found the Cascade mint in boxes of 100, so I usually stick with one of the other varieties mentioned above.<br />Bottom line, I have come to love most of the Stash tea flavors that contain mint, with the exception of the Merry Mint. Like I said though, I can kindof get it down, which is more than I can say about other teas with wintergreen in them. And these boxes of 100 are such a great value, as I drink several cups per day!

review/summary: Knew I liked the product, got what I expected
review/text: I wouldn't have ordered 100 of these teabags without trying them first, so I grabbed the smaller size box at my local grocery store. I'd been trying to drink more green tea and realizing my generous cubicle neighbor probably wanted to encourage my new habit, but not necessarily fund it by continuing to "donate" bags to me. I really liked the STASH green tea, so before my small box was up, I ordered this one. It is a delicious green tea to me, but as with many green teas, FINISH IT WHILE IT'S HOT. Seriously - if it cools down, it gets bitter. I thought the value of this box was excellent since I'm up to 1-3 cups per day, so this worked well. I posted a few pics of how the packaging came so you can see - no "retail" boxes, but they are each individually wrapped. Note that it just came in a cardboard box and the little packs inside weren't lined in a plastic bag, so if you have this delivered, just make sure it stays dry. I think a rainy day on my doorstep could have been messy, though I do think the tea bags are foil lined enough to prevent moisture from entering? Still, I wouldn't want to risk it! I've already added this to my Wish List entitled "re-stock items" :)

I used water that had not quite starting boiling so as not to burn the tender tea.  Steeped it for 2 mins and added some Ambrosia raw unfiltered honey.  I bought both products via Amazon's "Subscribe And Save" so I saved an additional few dollars off their already low price.  Any subscribe and save purchase comes with free shipping even if the total order is less than $25.  Amazing savings and fantastic taste.  Sorry if I seem like an advertisement but I'm really excited.  Tea is sooo expensive in the grocery store so I saved a bundle and I'm drinking some of the best decaf green tea I've had in a while. Extremely smooth with no bitter after taste.

review/text: I love most of Stash's green teas.  LOVE them.  Most of them are grassy and flavorful but lack the bitterness of many other brands of green.<br /><br />This is the exception.  Blech!  It is incredibly astringent, something even more common in Jasmine greens than in a straight green.  I recommend trying it from a grocery store before committing to a large Amazon purchase unless you happen to like bitter tea.  That sounds absurd to me, but I do have friends who prefer their tea with a bitter bite.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P9D3GC">Yamamotoyama Jasmine Tea Bag</a> (which stash also sells, but I couldn't find it here) is flavorful but retains the mild, non-bitter green flavor I've come to know and love.

review/summary: Subtle, Delicate, Delicious
review/text: I *loved* this tea.  I am mostly alone in my love:  many of my friends and guests prefer stronger teas, and the flavor of this is anything but.  Even if you stack multiple bags in a single brew, you're going to end up with a subtle flavor.  That's most good white teas for you.  "Strong" white teas exist even though the phrase is something of a contradiction in terms, but they exist by layering on a lot of flavor that doesn't come from the tea leaf itself.  Those remind me of herbal teas even though they've thrown in a white tea base.  In this tea, the lemon flavor is as subtle as the white so that you can taste both.  I think it's heaven.<br /><br />This tea is more forgiving of an overly long steep than most white teas, but it's still a white tea and will go bitter if steeped too long.<br /><br />I find I dislike it as an iced tea and even once it reaches room temperature.  The oils separate out and form a film on top with trapped tea dust.  It won't hurt you, but it's very off-putting.<br /><br />To enjoy a cooler beverage, I put a teabag or two directly into room temperature or cold water.  It lends a little flavor to the water without giving up a film of yuck to float on top.  I love doing this with any good green tea, and just a very few whites.  It adds a subtle yum, like a delicate natural flavored water.<br /><br />Alas, this has lemon grass in it.  This is good news for most people:  lemon grass is delicious!  It's also a grass, though.  If you have wheat or grass allergies, discuss lemongrass with your allergist and pay attention to how you feel on days you consume it.  I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4IVGU">Stash Premium Decaf White Raspberry Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> just as much as I like this, so I've switched over to avoid that little extra bit of stuffiness from consuming a grass product.

review/summary: Health in a Teabag
review/text: Aaah, nothing like good black tea!  Black tea, in addition to having a very pleasant flavor has many health properties.  It regulates your blood sugar; it is cardio-healthy; it inhibits cancer; it reverses clogging of the arteries; it has anti-oxidants; it is an anti-inflammatory and virus buster and it just plain tastes good.  The myriad of varieties of English teas are derived from black tea.  If you want good, affordable black tea, then you want this tea.

review/summary: my number one choice for salad dressing
review/text: For years the only reason I'd never eat a salad is because of this particular flavor- Robusto Italian dressing with JUST the right amount of zest.  I'd especially make sure to cover up the brown lettuce with this type of salad dressing because I used to strongly dislike the brown part from a head of lettuce.  Actually I still do!  Everyone tells me there's not much of a difference in taste from green to brown lettuce but, unfortunately according to my sensitive tastebuds there most certainly IS a major difference!  Anyway besides lettuce I prefer to use bacon bits, croutons, carrots, cucumbers, peppers, peas and maybe even onions and parmesan cheese in my salad.  These are all things that make a perfect salad to me, but without Robusto Italian salad dressing, it's just not the same.  These days I love salad.  One of my favorite foods.  I don't use NEARLY as much salad dressing that I used to either.  I used to dump about 30% of the bottle on one tiny bowl of salad, LOL.  Adding just a touch of salad dressing allows me to better appreciate the taste of both the vegetables and the dressing itself.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Best Italian Dressing
review/text: After trying nearly every Italian dressing on the grocery store shelves, Wish Bone Robusto Italian is BY FAR the best of any.  Just the right blend of oil and vinegar, and then the spices make all the difference.  For several years I had given up on Italian dressings and was buying nothing but Hidden Valley Ranch.  When Wish Bone came out with Robusto Italian, I gave it a try and am so glad I did!  Try some soon -- if you like a flavorful Italian, you may agree this one's the BEST!

review/summary: Aquired Taste
review/text: Okay. Let's be honest here. Bottled coffee drinks aren't 'good' and even their diet versions wreak havoc on your body. Since everybody is so health and weight conscious now, this product could provide a suitable replacement.<br /><br />It tastes somewhat like something Starbucks can sell readymade. And it is a name brand which can be stored in the pantry until opened. This will help convince skeptics who would not otherwise want to sip a 'health food'. The product is found in many health food stores, it can also be found at mainstream retailers.<br /><br />But it does taste more watery than the later--including their light version. I've never had this problem with other soy drinks. I am assuming it's the individual company recipe. I'd like to see them get this remedied as quickly as possible.<br /><br />With the rise in health consciousness, this specific product would really fill an inevitable-void. People want iced coffee drinks while not drinking something which is 'bad'.

I doctor many health foods to make it to my taste, and this one is no exception - I just add a touch of decaf coffee and it gives it a robustness, then I sprinkle cinnamon.  Yummm!<br /><br />I pour a half cup of it in the morning, then nuke it for a minute. then sprinkle some instant decaff coffee (I prefer Taster's Choice the best - it has the most delectable taste) and cinnamon and this stuff is delicious.  Not as screaming get up and go like a Starbucks coffee - but it does wake you up.  Highly recommended. Except for the price.  I cannot seem to find it in health food stores - wonder if it is in normal stores.  I usually buy a 12 case online from another company - its about $20.00 cheaper there than on Amazon.  I buy almost anything I need online from Amazon, so this is one of the very few products I do not buy from Amazon. Love Amazon.

review/summary: Simple syrup by any other name
review/text: I disagree the reviewer who said "Calling this product Pure Cane Syrup is like calling sugar water with maple flavoring "Pure Maple Syrup"."  This product is made with pure cane sugar and water, thus, it is pure cane sugar syrup.  Sugar water with maple flavoring is not analogous at all, as it contains ingredients OTHER than maple sugar and water (i.e. cane sugar!).  Anyway, this is really just simple syrup, which can easily be made at home, but this offers a convenient dispensing of the product and with no heating, cleanup, cooking time, etc.  Not an economical substitute, then, but a convenient and satisfactory one.

You can make Monin's product at home yourself by mixing equal part sugar and water over light heat (and skip the preservatives).  Calling this product Pure Cane Syrup is like calling sugar water with maple flavoring "Pure Maple Syrup".  If you are too lazy to make simple syrup then this product is for you.  At this price, this product is not worth it.  Do not be fooled (as I was).

You can make your own syrup by combining two parts (i.e. 2 cups) table sugar to one part (i.e. 1 cup) fresh water and boiling in a pot on the stove for a couple minutes. This will keep in the fridge FOREVER. If it crystallizes just reheat to dissolve. Any higher sugar-to-water ratio will likely crystallize too easily, and less will dilute your drinks/recipes.

Also, the gimmick can make for some messy openings. Whenever the marble is released, the soda never fails to overflow in fizz.

review/summary: Tasty and different!
review/text: I have been reading about the nutritional benefits of Black Rice and was happy to have found it on Amazon.com.  The rice can be used anywhere you would use white or brown rice.  I boiled it, drained and sauteed it in a little Extra Virgin Olive Oil, minced fresh garlic, minced fresh parsley and salt and pepper.  Its really, really savory.  Not bland at all.  I'm looking forward to trying it with stir fry.<br />My only "issue" is that the package doesn't include great instructions.  The best thing to do is to add the rice to boiling water and boil for about 18 minutes and drain.  It is parboiled, so it doesn't need to simmer for as long as regular rice does.<br />Also, it doesn't seem to "expand" as much as white or brown rice do.  That's not a complaint...just an observation.<br />I'm really happy with my purchase and expect to buy it again.<br />Its great to be able to try new products and to get them at a reasonable price.

review/summary: Aromatic, beautiful, and tasty
review/text: Several years ago I would buy this product at Trader Joe's. They no longer carry it. Since then, I've been looking around for it locally. I live in a populated area, so one would think it would be in stores locally. It isn't, or at least I haven't found it yet.<br /><br />TASTE/TEXTURE:<br />This rice tastes wonderful, and presents beautifully on a white plate. The black color really pops out. The shape is slightly thick and short grain. It has a floral aromatic quality and an excellent, hearty, slightly chewy texture. My brain associates dark colored rice to have an earthy character, like wild rice, but this rice is quite the opposite. It would compliment sweet/spicy stir-fry dishes, fish and anything else you would prefer a more floral type of rice for.<br /><br />FEEDBACK:<br />Everyone I have ever served it to loves this rice (and asks where I bought it). I wish this rice came in larger size quantities at a cheaper price so that I could use it more often.<br /><br />PREPARATION:<br />I use about the same amount of water that I use for brown rice in my rice cooker, and I put it on the brown rice setting. I've used a white rice setting before and it turned out fine, but a little more chewy than I preferred.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE:<br />From what I've read, this rice has its origins in China, but today is cultivated in Italy.

review/text: I purchased this thinking "the Italians are good with food, this should be delicious."  If you know anything about food, it looses its nutrition the more it's cooked.  This product comes pre-cooked, par-boiled.  Black rice is a rich, nutty, food that is so filling it's like a whole meal.  Foodies love it because it balance out the usual plate of protein, vegetables, and starch with flavorful starch.  It can be eaten alone, with milk as a breakfast, with beans in the forest or as a centerpiece of exotic meal.<br />However, the reason we love this stuff is because it's high in vitamins.  Not this stuff.  Par-boiling then drying it out destroys much of the vitamins and flavor.<br /><br />Stay far, far away if you want vitamins and flavor.

I use my rice cooker for it - no worries about boiled water running over all stove (this is how I usually cook rice :)). Before I start cooking I wash it, add garlic salt and olive oil. When it's ready - it is delicious!!!<br />It does look interesting when it's ready. My co-workers still can't stop thinking that I am eating mice drops :). Or I eat bugs and worms.<br />Even it is called "Black rice" the color is very dark purple. When you wash it you will see dark water comes from a pot.<br />I also use it for my salads to give it a little color and taste.<br />If you want to use it for a soup - I wouldn't recommend it unless you don't care if it turns in black color.<br /><br />By the way, if you use a rice cooker - cook it on "white rice" settings.

review/summary: Vet Enzadent for dogs EXCELLENT
review/text: My two precious girls passed away at 15 years of age, over the last 6 months.  I gave both of them these chews daily and they never had their teeth cleaned because of how well these work.  My vet used to say he wished all his dogs had teeth like mine.  The other products just don't compare - I've tried them!!

review/summary: Needs Attention
review/text: As a consumer of Irish Breakfast Tea for many years, and one who uses the loose leaf blend in order to enjoy the stronger flavor of the oils, I found this tea to have very little taste - and I can not stress this point enough. It is cut in a manner that should have allowed the oils in the leaf to be maintained, but something in the process or a dilution of the tea leaves has just washed the taste out of the blend. The people of the company themselves - the taste testers - need to pay attention to this tea blend in order to be taken seriously as a purveyor of fine tea (It's less tasty than diner tea). Thus my "I don't like it" rating - because there isn't any taste to hate!

review/summary: Not much flavor
review/text: I had ordered the rugelach from this company before and loved it, so decided to try their sugar-free version.  It was really not tasty and seemed pretty dry.  This was true for all 3 flavors we tried (raspberry, chocolate, and cinnamon).  I will definitely order more of their regular rugelach, but no more of their sugar-free.

review/summary: Excellent healthy snack!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this dried fruit.  LOVE IT.  Whenever I have a craving for something sweet, I can usually rip open one of these bags and forget all about eating something bad.<br /><br />I've tried every one of their choices but this bag is my favorite.  The apples and apricots are nice and sweet and the peaches give a little tang.  The fruit is also nice and crisp, not stale and bland.  I recommend this mix highly.  Kids love it too so this makes a great lunchbox snack.  Also wonderful for road trips.

review/summary: Great high-value training treat
review/text: Use this instead of string cheese as it is a high-value treat, but does not get your fingers or pocket goooey (like regular cheese). Like the fact that there are no "extra" (read fake) ingredients. Some of the larger chunks are hard to break up, but generally can break each piece into 2 or 3 smaller pieces. Pieces are about 1" long and 1/2" wide. Also good for situations where you are throwing the treat into the grass (i.e. when training agility weaves) as the bright yellow color makes it easy for the dog to see.

review/summary: My dog loves these!
review/text: Out of all the pure bite treats these are the best.  They don't break apart into a million pieces at the bottom of bag.  Our dog is a raw food dog so these treats are perfect for her diet....no additives, or other "unknown" ingredients!

review/text: My dog really enjoys these cheddar treats. They are crunchy and pretty large (about the size of my pinky), so they are more like a snack rather than a training reward.

review/summary: Great Cheese Treats for loved puppies
review/text: I have a 7 year old greyhound named Sir Bentley  Part of our bed time ritual is called BBCs<br />That stands for Beddy Bye Cookies.  Every night I set out the BBCs and Sir Bentley insists on a cookie for the trip down to our bedroom where he enjoys all of his BBCs.  He loves these cheese bites immensely and I love to see the happiness in his face as he enjoys his BBCs.  I love the larger bags of your treats and will continue to buy thru Amazon  nothing more to say than Woof

review/summary: My dog adores these delicious treats
review/text: My dog has long displayed a preference for cheese above nearly any other substance, so I was delighted when a friend gave him one of these as a Christmas gift.  He loved it!  This is a healthy treat (in moderation, of course) and allows you to give your dog cheese without treading in "human food" territory, which many of us try to avoid.  You can fulfill the craving while still maintaining some semblance of order....  This is a fantastic treat, definitely the best cheese-related dog snack I've come across yet.  Great job!
