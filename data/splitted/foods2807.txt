review/summary: Fiber Power -Power Taste!
review/text: Bakery on Main's fiber power is the best tasting fiber granola Ive ever ordered, being celiac since birth its been a difficult road to find gluten free granola, most all are cross contaminated or they contain a wheat gluten from another source. NOT with this one, the amount of fiber in serving eaten with your morning breakfast is enough for the entire day!  This is the only product I would back saying this!

review/summary: GF Cinnamon Raisin Granola
review/text: I really enjoyed this GF granola by Bakery on Main. I try to get more fiber in my diet because of the dietary needs I have, and sometimes that can be a challenge. A lot of high fiber foods don't taste good or are very expensive. This granola, however, is delicious and reasonably priced. Also, Bakery on Main provides coupons, which is great! I would recommend this cereal.

review/text: ETA's BBQ is a great, tangy, slightly spicy, BBQ sauce that is a great all-round sauce.<br />I use it in meat pies, gravies and savoury mince recipes - about a teaspoon of BBQ sauce with a couple of tablespoons of Tomato sauce, along with a dash of white pepper and salt.<br />It's been an Australian standby for so many decades, I can't even recall when it was first produced.<br />It goes great with grilled lamb chops & cutlets, steak of any type, red meat kebabs, and virtually all BBQ'ed red meat.<br />Some people even like it on their chicken - but it goes better with red meat.

review/text: I tried this mix and found the cookies too sweet.  Additionally, it's difficult to make - instead of creaming the sugar into the butter, you add all of the dry ingredients at once into the egg/vanilla/butter mixture.  I finally used my hands to "knead" the dough in order to incorporate all of the dry ingredients.

review/summary: Mindblowingly Good
review/text: It wasn't until I bought a bag of these when I finally learned what good potato chips taste like. It's sort of like the epiphany you have when you think American cheese is the best cheese you've ever had until you actually try smoked gouda. I know that sounds like an overstatement, but that's how good Herr's Heinz-flavored ketchup chips are. Once you try these, all of your previous favorites will start to pale in comparison.<br /><br />"What's so darned great about them?" you are probably wondering. What's gotten everyone in such a tizzy? Why the rave reviews and the almost cult-like devotion to these chips? It's not just because they taste good. It's because Herr's is one of the few snack makers that bucks that shady practice so many of them engage in now, especially Pringles. You know what I mean-- that cute, little trick of advertising their chips as literally bursting with flavor, when in reality the chips are so lightly dusted that there's barely any flavor to them. Herr's philosophy in terms of chip-to-flavor ratio couldn't be more different. Open any one of their snacks-- especially this one-- and the chips are so covered in powder that it's impossible to not have it cake up on your finger tips without constantly cleaning them. These Heinz ketchup flavored chips are so heavily dusted, in fact, that you'll wind up with red-stained fingers for a few hours after gorging on them. It makes for a messy experience but in the end, getting a moutful of flavor with each bite makes the hassle of cleaning up all worthwhile!<br /><br />Sure, this excessive powder doesn't exactly make Herr's the healthiest of snack choices, but what snack is? It's all gonna kill us, anyway, so really-- all this really comes down to is choosing our poison. My poison happens to be these chips, and will most likely be yours once you taste them and subsequently become hopelessly addicted like me.

review/summary: Great flavor, Ketchup Chips
review/text: First time trying Herr's brand Ketchup potato chips, really love them. Its just as good as other brand catsup chips that I've tried in Canada. Glad these chips are available here in the U.S. and uses great flavoring with Heinz brand ketchup. Many think it may seem odd to have ketchup on chips, its similar to eating normally fries and ketchup. It doesn't have that strong of a overwhelming ketchup flavor on the chips, which is great, reason many of my friends like them<br /><br />If really want a stronger ketchup flavored taste, I personally recommend get a bottle of Heinz ketchup and dip your ketchup flavored chips into some actual ketchup, like you would with fries.

review/summary: what a flavor!
review/text: When these Herr's ketchup-flavored chips first hit the market, I remember I was taking some assembly in high school and a worker from Herr's was trying to convince the class to take a free bag of chips.  Everyone was either disinterested or disgusted by the thought of ketchup chips, and I regret following suit and leaving with the classmates while ignoring the free miniature bag samples in the box.  I strongly regret it in fact.  These chips are *awesome!*  I highly recommend them.  Don't just ignore them because the thought of ketchup on a potato chip sounds unappealing- they're actually really good.

review/text: The product is amazingly addictive, but the price quoted here is way beyond bad.  At my local Save-A-Lot, I can buy a 3.75 ounce bag for $1.00, no tax.  If this is 42 1-ounce bags, then that would total 11.2 regular bags, or $11.20 ($12 rounded to a full bag).  The official site is just as bad wanting to sell a box of 15 normal bags for $25 before shipping.<br /><br />My local store is running out, but I don't want to be paying this much for wholesale.

However, I still prefer Lays BBQ chips as my number one choice though.  I paid only 99 cents for a one ounce bag. Worth it.

review/summary: Ketchup chips are great, but these aren't them
review/text: There is currently a problem with this item entry in Amazon.  The description that comes up in a search, before you get to this page, is "Herr's Potato Chips, Heinz Ketchup Flavored, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 42)."<br /><br />I ordered this and got a 42-bag variety pack of various other chips like BBQ and regular, not any ketchup-flavored ones.  Upon closer examination, the description that is on this page just lists "Herr's Potato Chips," in contrast to the other description.<br /><br />I was able to return the item, but was informed that there are no Herr's Ketchup-Flavored Chips available.  (And I really don't get that.  If the ketchup-flavored chips are so popular and in such demand, you'd think that Herr's would do something about ramping up their production accordingly, and maybe ramping down some of the other flavors, because these chips are pretty much NEVER available.  But apparently I'm talking crazy talk.)<br /><br />Oh well.

review/summary: Addictive
review/text: A couple of years ago, my Wal-Mart carried large bags of these for a short time and I was instantly hooked but when they stopped, I couldn't get them without ordering directly from Herr's site which was a bit of a hassle. Now that I can get them from Amazon, feeding my addiction is easier and more convenient.<br /><br />Although I generally like BBQ and spicy foods, most BBQ flavored chips and jalepeno/salsa/hot flavored chips taste somewhat bland and very artificial to me. It's not that I can't taste the flavors; it's just that they don't seem to resemble the actual taste of BBQ or peppers or salsa, etc. But with these chips, it really tastes like eating crisp french fries smothered in ketchup, and licking my bright red fingertips clean is half the fun!<br /><br />Packaging was a little excessive. Looks like Herr's ships their standard store-delivery box (already well padded) to Amazon which puts the entire Herr's box into an Amazon box for shipment to you. Net result is that you get a huge box with a whole lot of tape, plastic, and cardboard between you and the chips.

Eventhough, I'm no fan of ketchup, but I am a fan of chips. Ketchup is old-school and out-dated. Away with ketchup! (not really) So anyways, turns out, these chips had great taste to it. Has more tomatoe taste than I think it should have. Nevertheless, experience the crisp crunchiness of potatoe chips, in the flavor of french-fries dipped in ketchup! Perpare your face for a smile!

review/summary: unbelieveble
review/text: I am too busy (or lazy) to leave a feedback for all my purchases and I feel bad because customers feedback are very helpful.<br />This product is different, I have to share my opinion about this one: I have a 8 yrs. old Bichon Frise. Brushing her teeth is impossible so I tried different treatment products but every visit to the vet proved that they didn't work and Candy (my dog) needed a professional (and very expensive) dental cleanings. Basically those so called treatments were just waste of money. Meanwhile, I was ordering dog food from Amazon and I added a bag of Nutri-Vet Dental Health Soft Chews treats to my order. She loves the taste and after a little while I noticed her teeth looked brighter and less yellow. Of course I thought it was my imagination. Well, during her next checkup by her vet I found out it wasn't my imagination, her teeth were clean and her gums were healthy and according to the vet we could put off the professional (and very expensive) teeth cleaning for later.<br />Can you believe that? I recommend this product to all dog owners.

It's not a big circular box, as pictured, but a rather small, rectangular box (with perhaps half the chocolates as pictured - if wrappers count).

review/summary: Best non-whey non-soy alternative
review/text: Edit: Upgraded to 5-star.  They appear to have changed the recipe, as the last couple containers I have acquired have tasted substantially better! It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />I'm allergic to both whey and soy, which has made finding a good protein supplement quite a pain! I have tried pretty much everything on the market, including a variety of wheat, buckwheat, and brown rice proteins.  If you are looking for the highest quality protein available, you are unfortunately limited to egg, soy, whey, or casein (based upon PDCAAS, the FDA and FAO/WHO's method of determining protein quality), so egg is really preferable to the alternatives.  Fortunately, this is, in terms of consistency, digestibility, and nutritive content (0 fat 0 carbs), and overall flavor, the best of the various proteins I tried.  In case you are wondering, there is no cholesterol in this protein, either.  Texture and overall 'drinkability' are great... I drink it mixed with water with no issues.  Flavor is decent: obviously, none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor extravaganza.  This protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate (not as good as most whey/casein proteins, but better than almost all non-whey proteins... I tried quite a few of those as well before discovering that I could not tolerate dairy proteins).  Be warned: the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible.  In my opinion, it is barely drinkable.<br /><br />Four stars overall.  If I had no food sensitivities, I might still use this in conjunction with whey protein, but would probably not use it exclusively.<br />Five stars if you can't have whey protein!<br /><br />I hope that this review is helpful!

review/summary: Egg Protein Review
review/text: I found this to be a good alternative to whey based protein powder. I have only used this product for 30 days and am reordering. Before I get into my review, I might mention that I never thought of myself as whey or lactose intolerant, but after 3 months of taking quality whey protein I knew that what I was experiencing was not typical. (I'm talking about bathroom habits including frequency and consistency). I asked a few older guys in the gym what there experience was with whey, most if not all where fine with it and experienced no problems or side effects. One natural BB that is about my age late 30's suggested this egg based protein product and noted that one of his training customers found it to be an acceptable alternative to the milk based protein products.<br /><br />I did some research and to be honest the manufactures web site for beHealthyNFit is totally useless and outdated with little or no useful information. Their poor web site almost made me not buy this product. It sure didn't invoke any consumer confidence and in my opinion is totally unacceptable.<br /><br />How does it taste? I bought the chocolate (I'm not a chocolate lover but I think chocolate flavoring is the best option for protein powders) The flavor is chocolate but its defiantly not a rich milk chocolate and it wouldn't fall in the same category as a dessert. More of a taste that you can get used to.  I have also seen this flavor described as chocolate with a hint metallic. I'd agree with that. It has an after taste that some may find metallic.<br /><br />How does it mix? I mix this with water directly in a 16oz. ready to drink water bottle. I drink 1 or 2 ounces, usually down to the top of the label. Then I place a funnel in the top and dump in one scoop. Usually I will need to shake or tap the funnel to get the powder to pass through. Then I screw the top on and shake well. I have found that if the water is very cold the powder will clump more often and mix poorly. Room temperature water or water that is cool but not ice-cold works best. I use a wine fridge to keep the water at 50.( I don't like clumps) Note: The consistency is exactly like water, if your expecting this to be a thick or heavy drink then will be disappointed.<br /><br />I found that if you live in a humid state like Florida you will need to make sure that you screw the lid to the protein power on tight. If you expose this power to high humidity you will have a terrible time with it clumping and mixing properly.<br /><br />General tips for drinking protein drinks. I have found that eating a granola bar while drinking a protein drink helps. First biting the granola bar then taking a drink. I found this to work for me and it makes the occasional protein clump less noticeable.<br /><br />Is there room for improvement? Yes, loads of room for improvement. Is there anything better? I haven't found it yet but I am still looking. I will give this high marks until I find something better. Please leave a comment if you find a better non whey protein product.

review/summary: Superb when you can't take whey or even when you can
review/text: This product has 24g of protein per serving and is ideal for getting lean because it has only about 110 calories and practically no fat. The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean. Pure egg is a purely brilliant idea...

review/text: I have been using this protein powder for about a month. The first thing I noticed is that this brand mixes better than Optimum Nutrition egg protein, but still not like whey or even rice protein. The texture is not great by itself in my opinion- not awful but not great. I have been mixing Garden of Eating Super Seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture. I've also tried blending the two with ice to make a smoothy which turned out ok. For those of us who can't tolerate the whey or soy proteins, this particular brand is the best I've found.

review/summary: This is a great alternative to whey
review/text: I've been a fan of HnF's egg protein for a while now as whey bloats me and gives me indigestion (that being said, the ONLY whey I've found that doesn't bother my stomach at all is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BOTGTM">Optimum Nutrition 100% Platinum Hydro Whey Turbo Chocolate 1.75 Protein</a>).<br /><br />The chocolate tastes pretty good with water (although I don't really care about taste), and is actually pretty darn good with rice milk. It also tastes good in smoothies (I use frozen bananas and rice milk).<br /><br />Only downside is you may get gas initially and you're going to smell things that no human should smell. This passes pretty quickly (huhuh) though.<br /><br />Oh and don't buy the vanilla flavored powder because it tastes like soap. I use it in smoothies and it lends a little vanilla flavor but it's still not very good.

review/summary: Low calorie, high protein, great taste
review/text: I really like this protein drink. I'm pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat. This is the perfect solution. I usually mix it with a combination of 1/2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions, otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort. I prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often GMO and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy (or for anyone actually), and whey protein is a dairy product, which I generally don't tolerate well. Egg protein is perfect for my needs.

review/summary: The Best Protein Out There
review/text: In my opinion, this is the best protein powder out there.<br />I've used a lot of different protein products, from Dymatize to Optimum Nutrition (Gold Standard) and CellTech (MuscleTech), BSN, many others as well.  The reason that I tried this one is because I've been doing a lot of research, talking with my doctor and nutritionists regarding the subject of protein and protein suppliments in general.  The conclusion that I have come to is that the whey products are ok, but they are not the magic dust that everyone thinks it is.  Sure it is good, and the protein is not bad, but it can be better.<br />For those who have issues with dairy, whey is not an option.  Whey is a dairy product, and actually a bi-product of diary production.  Dairy is not the best choice of protein out there, many may disagree with this but it is a fact.  America has an infatuation with dairy and sweets.  If you look at any tables that show protein absorbtion effeciency in our bodies you will see this fact.  Eggs and Fish are rated at the top for best absorbtion and usage in the human body.  Eggs are around 88% effeciency, while fish is around 70% and chicken around 60%.  Whey and dairy are below all of these, this is precisely why whey is so cheap, and that is why it is so popular.  Sure the egg protein is going to be more expensive, but it is a better product.<br />As far as taste and texture, I find it just as good as the whey products that I have used, and even better then some.  I've tried some whey powders that were just aweful.  I have a 5lb tub of "Metabolic" whey that I tried, it is still sitting in the back room.

review/summary: Very good nutritionally, but expensive and clumpy
review/text: The Healthy 'n Fit egg protein is a very good product. It's almost all protein, the taste is good, you can cook with it (my favorites are oatmeal and Russian-style cottage cheese pancakes). And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product. But I just don't think it warrants a higher price than the Optimum Nutrition protein.<br /><br />So, to recap, as compared to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>:<br />Pros:<br />Lower in carbs<br />Lower in fat<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive<br />Clumpier/harder to mix

review/summary: A Protein Powder to make you Gag.
review/text: I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.<br /><br />I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new "worst" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I've tried a number of protein powders over the years.  Most problems I encountered ranged from poor taste, to not mixing well, to leaving me bloated.  The Healthy n Fit egg protein is only 100 calories and you get 24 grams of protein with no cholesterol, no fat, no carbs, minimal sodium (in the big scheme of things) and even some potassium.  Add to that the fact that it mixes really well and tastes good either on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I don't feel bloated with this at all like I did with other products like Muscle Milk light.  I usually throw a banana and some blueberries into a blender with one serving of the protein for breakfast and then I use it straight right after a good workout.  Again, it tastes great on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I strongly recommend this product.

review/summary: Best Natural Protein
review/text: Having a lactose intolerance, I've tried multiple egg proteins as well as some Whey Isolate proteins as well. This is hands down the best tasting protein powder out there. Vanilla and Chocolate are both delicious (I would stay away from Strawberry, it has a strange artificial taste to it, this was the updated formula too so they still haven't worked it out). I prefer to mix with some Vanilla Coconut milk and it's actually something I look forward to drinking (as opposed to some that I had just choked down as quickly as I could). I have also mixed in a teaspoon of cinnamon with just water and the vanilla protein and it is good as well.<br /><br />Another plus is that it uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners such as sucralose or aspartame.<br /><br />If you can't handle Whey/Casein protein then I would absolutely recommend this one (even if you can but want to try something else). Best bang for your buck compared to other egg proteins and the taste is actually good.

review/text: I like this product, and i agree with any post, who says it mixes well, i bought a sample case just to test the waters, and i dont feel bloated or anything after i drink it, i think i feel my body is responding to it very well, i am going to finish up the muscle milk protein because i bought it and i pay over 30 for it, lol, but when i finish up the other proteins i purchase, i am going to stick with egg white protein, since i dont like eating them, everyone taste buds is different, some may like it, some may dont, then depending on your body chemistry some responds well to egg whites, some dont, but as for me personally i like it so far, might try out the strawberry passion protein, but the vanilla kind taste very good, i would suggest this protein should be used for edurance athletes, or people who are into calistenics such as push ups and pull ups,

review/summary: SEEMS TO CONTAIN SOY?
review/text: I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AS A REPLACEMENT FOR JAY ROBB EGG WHITE PROTEIN SHAKES, WHICH IS WHAT I PREFER BUT DOESN'T FIT MY BUDGET - TO EXPENSIVE FOR EVERY DAY USE.  I WAS LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE AND CAME ACROSS THIS.  SINCE ONE OF THE REVIEWS SAID THAT IT WAS SOY FREE I DECIDED TO TRY IT.  I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE TASTE WITH ALL OF MY HEALTH PROBLEMS OVER THE YEARS I HAVE LEARNED NOT TO EXPECT A LOT IN THAT DEPARTMENT.  IT JUST TASTE LIKE WATERED DOWN CHOCOLATE TO ME.  I DRINK IT WITH WATER OR SOMETIMES WITH RICE MILK BECAUSE I NEED THE EXTRA CALORIES ON DAYS THAT I CAN'T HANDLE SOLID FOODS.  HOWEVER,ON RECEIVING THE PRODUCT, IT DOES CONTAIN SOY. HOW MUCH I COULDN'T SAY AS IT WASN'T LISTED ON THE INGREDIGENT COLUMN.  I FOUND IT MENTIONED ON THE BACK OF THE LABEL STATING THAT IT CONTAINED SOY LETICHEN(THINK I SPELLED THAT RIGHT).  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH.  IF SOMEONE COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THE INFO. ALSO,I NOTICED THAT IT HAS GONE UP ABOUT $10.00 SINCE I PLACED MY ORDER LAST MONTH,SO IT MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE ANYMORE, BECAUSE THAT PUTS IT ABOUT EVEN WITH WHAT I WAS PAYING FOR THE JAY ROBB EGG WHITE SHAKES.

review/text: So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint.

review/text: I love this cinnamon tea and drink it every morning.  It is now much more difficult to find locally, so I ordered a case of it once from Amazon and got a great deal.  When I went to do it again this time, Amazon no longer carried it, but they brokered it for Bigelow to sell direct.  I had to pay more shipping for Bigelow to send it than Amazon and it took much longer to arrive, almost two weeks instead of two or three days from Amazon.  I'll still buy it this way because I can't reliably find it in my area, but I'm not as thrilled as I was last time.

review/summary: A delightful treat
review/text: Obviously, coffee reviews are highly subjective. The best way to get an idea of the quality of this product is for me to provide a little background as to what my own tastes are, so that the reader may better determine whether he or she might agree with my interpretation.<br /><br />My absolute favorite coffee is a hazelnut flavored brew, though I'm not particularly fond of "light" roasts. I prefer a more full-bodied coffee, though I find St--bu--s to be pure swill (I swear, they have one blend of coffee, and just change the amount of water at brew time, along with the grind). If I could have coffee heaven, it would probably be hazelnut Kona, but I've yet to find it (my quest is not yet over!).<br /><br />Getting back to this delight...<br /><br />I stumbled on this one after reading a review of Donut House Collection: Cinnamon Roll, which absolutely had me in hysterics, and which clearly recommended Timothy's instead. Intrigued, though not a real lover of cinnamon coffee (in my younger day, I used to enjoy a cinnamon breakfast blend, and have always - at least, until now - considered cinnamon coffee to be a breakfast coffee), I decided to give this a try (we have a K-Cup brewer in the office, which for me, is a bit less than economical, as I measure my daily coffee intake by the pot and not by the cup).<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Let me re-state that: WOW!!!!!<br /><br />The coffee itself is full bodied, but without edge (no bitterness). It brews a large cup (max setting on our brewer, suitable for a travel mug) without becoming watery. The aroma is absolutely divine, filling the office waiting room with a light scent, truly reminiscent of a real pastry shop (no kidding), and the cinnamon isn't just in the air. The overtone is distinct without being overdone, meaning the amount of cinnamon to the brew is just right. Have one cup, and you'll want a second one.<br /><br />In that same order, I picked up more hazelnut (Gloria Jean's, this time, vs Green Mountain, though I prefer the latter, in general) and a great deal on a large quantity of Tully's Kona Blend. That was April 10, and I am now coming back to re-order this Timothy's Cinnamon, while I have plenty of hazelnut and Kona left. I would have never thought it possible that another flavor could woo me from my two favorites, but this has truly won me over.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: I am a big fan of drinking tea, and love a good earl grey.  This is one of the best earl greys you can get, unless you upgrade to the loose leaf teas.  It's great at work and on the go, where you don't have time or equipment to brew loose leaf teas.  The tea holds up well through a range of temperatures and doesn't taste as bitter as some others out there.  I recommend brewing it at temperature below boiling to produce smoother flavor (I usually add a little bit of cold water to the cup before pouring in boiling water to control the steeping).  The only downside is it's a little expensive for 15 servings.  Would recommend without hesitation to anybody looking for a decent earl grey.

review/text: The packaging is great for a gift.  The teabags are pyramidal in shape.  As far as taste, if you're just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla, then this Tazo brand will do it for you. If you're looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste, then the addition of vanilla at least in this brand of tea, Tazo, will disappoint you.  The raw rooibos taste, without these "improvements" such as vanilla, is full-bodied and has its own unique taste.  I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings, Republic of Tea, and Numi.

review/summary: But what about recycling?
review/text: I love awake tea, but I am mad that you can't get the labels off the tin to reuse it. Nor can you compost the nylon bags.  The packaging is not earth friendly.  Even though I love the tea leaves less chopped-up, I buy the other packaging.  What's wrong with you Tazo? Starbucks?  It can't be that bad to use a different glue for the cute tins so we can store rubber-bands in them!<br />It can't hurt your profit margin too much to use another fabric for your tea bags.  As soon as you do I will be a loyal customer!

review/summary: Worst Rooibos
review/text: I tried this tea as my introduction to Rooibos.  I was very excited after hearing of the benefits of rooibos.  To my dissapointment I thought this tea was disgusting!<br /><br /> Luckily, I didn't give up and tried other brands (Numi and Yogi are great) of rooibos and they were all fantastic.  This tea has a stale vanilla taste that completely covers up the natural flavor of rooibos.  Stay away from this tea.  Plain rooibos without added flavors is perfect on it's own.

review/summary: I Will Never know
review/text: I will never know how this product is.<br />Amazon/Starbucks chose to send this order with the requirement I sign for it!  Why they would do this on a $20.00 order is beyond me.  I work and am not home to sign for packages.  The package was returned and Amazon/Starbucks has yet to reply to my emails or even return my money.<br />This in my first Amazon disappointment and I have ben a customer for nearly 10 years.

review/summary: Good product, no separate paper wrappers for tea bags
review/text: I was planning on separating this into 5 separate gift baskets but the tea bags do not have their own individual paper wrapper so I had to make labels for them.  Otherwise it's great tea.

review/summary: Lovely Organic Cinnamon tea! Enjoy this anytime.
review/text: Organic and caffiene free.  This is a delicious tea that tastes great anytime. The cinnamon smell wonderful when brewing. I love that these are individual wrapped with not tags to worry about; so I can enjoy juts one cup when I want. Of course, I unwrap 8 to make a whole pot.<br /><br />I personally enjoy 1 bag to 6 ounces water, and like it lightly sweetened. if you ad too much sweetener, it changes the taste drastically.<br /><br />The orange peel and mint are very understated. This is more a delicious cinnamon tea.
