review/text: I love the idea of this product but with larger pills the beef pill pockets are much easier to mold around the pill than the chicken. Although my dogs love both flavors my boxer can easily eat the pill pocket and spit out the pill with the chicken flavor but does not do that with the beef flavor again because it is easier to bury the entire pill in the pocket using the beef.  They work great with smaller pills.

review/summary: No easier way to give pet medications
review/text: Pill Pockets are in the category "Why didn't I think of that??!"<br /><br />With two sizes of Pill Pockets to choose, Capsule or Tablet (be sure to notice the distinction),  most any size medication can be "hidden" within to make your dog's pill-taking and easy job.  Chicken or Beef, both are very welcome by our dogs.  Just drop the medication into the little pocket, roll into a ball and watch your dog enjoy his new "treat".  We combine our dog's three small pills into one pocket with no problem, even into the small "tablet" size.  Again be sure to choose which size pocket you need -- the Capsule size is unnecessarily large if not required.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BS4G6O">Greenies Pill Pockets, Beef, 3.2 oz, for Tablets</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BSBFUO">Greenies Pill Pockets, Chicken, 7.9 oz, for Capsules</a>

review/summary: Pill pockets for a picky dog
review/text: Pill pockets are about the only thing I can get my dog to take her medicine in. I would suggest the larger capsules to save money. If you want to only use half or less of a pill pocket, they easily mash together or come apart to make any size.

review/text: My dogs love them. They swallow them before realizing a pill is in them. The only bad thing is that they crumble easily, but they can be squeezed back together.  I used to use cheese, but the dogs figured out pills were hidden in them, they got where they wouldn't take it anymore. With these, they just take it immediately, pill & all.

review/text: These are so great!  My dog had to take medication after his neuter surgery, and I wasn't sure how I was going to accomplish this task given our previous experience with pills.  He always ate whatever the pill was stuck into, but left the pill...typical!  This time, he swallowed the pill-stuffed "treat" in one gulp.  He never imagined something was inside.  Giving him his medications are a breeze now!  The treats are very moist, soft and malleable...my dog loves them!!

review/text: We have two Siberian Huskies and the oldest has to take medication every night. She hates the way it smells and will dig it out of anything else we try to hide it in - even cake.  But these are amazing.  We just put the capsule inside, push the treat together at the top, and she gobbles it up.  Completely masks the scent and both she and our younger dog actually beg for them as treats (yes, the younger dog also gets one every night, but without a pill inside).

review/summary: Nice way to hide pills.
review/text: Hiding gelcaps inside the pill pockets work very well for me. I grabbed the large kind and cut each one in half, then squish them between my fingers a bit to get the pill pocket nice and soft before shaping it around my dog's medicine. He doesn't love these, but he prefers them to raw pills.<br /><br />The only con about this product for me is that a lot of the time, many of the pill 'pockets' arrive in the bags completely smashed together or torn up into bits and pieces. I guess it isn't a big problem since I cut them up anyway, but it would be nice to not have to pick out pieces of them from inside the bag to mold together.

review/summary: Giving Your Dogs Medicine Has Never Been So Easy.
review/text: In the past, my family always hid dog meds inside braunshchweiger so they would take them.  It works great, but it's so smelly and messy.  When I took my beagle Regal to the vet for eating something weird in the back yard (at least that's my guess), our verterinarian recommended Greenies Pill Pockets.  What a dream come true.  No mess, you just slip them in the little hole and seal them up, and the medication is down the hatch without finding it spat out on the floor in some place the dog thinks is clever to hide the evidence.  They don't smell, and both our dogs love the way they taste.  They're a little pricey, but if you want your dogs to take medication mess free and fuss free, these are an excellent way of doing it.  They make a nice little treat when the pills are gone too.

review/text: My dog, Spike, had a skin infection requiring taking 2 antibiotic capsules twice daily for just over a month, and the antibiotic had such a strong smell that I'd want to run away too when opening the bottle.  I've always snubbed Pill Pockets because of the expense - it was cheaper to bury medicines in pieces of hot dog, cheese, or bread or even burying it in peanut butter.  Stubborn Spike managed to figure all of these out though due to the strong scent of the medicine, and it made medicating him a nightmare.  As a last resort, I ordered Pill Pockets to give them a whirl.<br /><br />These really do make giving Spike his medicine so much easier!  In a week, he never turned his nose up or spit out medicine, and that means a lot less stress for this puppy mom.  Another reviewer said this and I figured I'd reiterate - they're a lot like chicken (or other meat, depending on your flavor) putty that's pre-shaped for capsules.  Spike's capsules (at 500mg each) were a little big for these pockets, but it was easy to shape around.  I know I'll be using these again rather than any other methods I've tried before.

review/summary: great way to get dogs to take meds...until they catch on
review/text: I started using these pill pockets in an effort to get my adult GSD to take her antibiotics. She figured out that peanut butter was a ploy and I needed to get her to eat it. The pill pockets were initially amazing because it wasn't as messy as peanut butter and instead of waiting 5 mins for the dogs to lick the spoon clean of med and peanut butter, she took the med in 5 seconds. That is, until she figured that there was a pill in the center. Now, she'll take it in her mouth and either spit out both pill and pocket or suck off the pill pocket and spit out the pill. Back to square 1 with her.<br /><br />My little pup also required meds for a time and he was still eating it up without a care in the world. Overall, great time saver, it's not as messy, and hopefully, your dog will keep eating it without noticing the pill inside.

review/text: I order a 6-pack of large dog chicken pill pockets every month.  The vendors vary; I buy from whichever vendor offers free shipping.  The last time I ordered, the pill pockets were all crumbly and torn inside the packages.  They weren't dried out; they were just torn up.  I had to mush our meds onto the pill pockets and mash shreds into a ball to get enough to cover the meds (my dog takes about 5 pills per meal, poor baby).  Anyway, every pouch was the same way.  I made sure to order from a different vendor this time even though it's hard to see how the vendor would be at fault for the product.  Regardless, I've never seen this before and I hope not to see it in my next shipment; if I do, back they go!

review/summary: Dog loves them!
review/text: These are wonderful products. It has been a trial getting our ten year old dog to take any pills. Since we discovered the pill pockets (he loves the chicken variety), giving him a pill has been a breeze. We always buy the large size and cut off a little to give to our other dog as a treat at the same time so the dog getting the pill is none the wiser. I can't imagine needing to shove a pill down our dog's throat again.

review/summary: Makes giving meds to my dog so much easier!
review/text: I have been using this product for two years now and love it.  I purchase the capsules version, even though my dog takes two tablets a day, because you get larger pockets with the capsule version.  I cut each pocket in thirds use each piece to cover the small pills I give my dog. There is no waste and the package lasts three times longer.  My dog loves takes her meds with no problem.

One of our Irish Setters sometimes needs buffered aspirin, and while they are supposed to be beef flavored, we had to hide them in tuna or something else for her to take them.  Now, it's a breeze!  And our younger setter is on a month of large capsules for Lyme, and these Greenies Pill pockets are the best!

review/summary: Your dog will love these - and so will you!
review/text: Does your dog spit out his/her meds? Maybe rolls it around in his/her mouth before spitting it out all gooey &/or smashed. Well, with these Greenies Pill Pockets - wheather beef or chicken flavor -they won't hesitate to readily take their meds &/or vitamins. To them, these Greenies Pill Pockets taste just like a treat & they eagely await to take them - actually sitting at attention while you fill the pocket with their meds. They come in two different sizes - one for capsules (these are the bigger ones) and one for tablets. Greenies also offers them for cats as well. I haven't had to give my cats these - but if & when they need to take any meds orally I will give them a try.

review/summary: These pill pockets literally saved our dog's life
review/text: I was so relieved when I found this product. Our doberman was having serious skin allergies and had to take antibiotics and steroids in pill form. He was so crafty with the pills - we would hide them in wet dog food, only to find the food eaten and the pills spit out. We hid them in salami, raw meat, pastrami, turkey, soft cheese, hard boiled egg, anything that you could think of that is appetizing to a dog and he would eat the food and spit out the pills. It got so bad that he actually stopped eating and drinking. He was so sick. Our vet put him on IV fluids and steroids and antibiotics and these wreaked havoc on his liver. We were so worried. He was going down the drain. Then I found this product. Simple as that, we put the medicine in the treat and he wolfed it down. He actually got to the point that when the 6 hour time was coming around to "get the treat" he would start whining and staring at the refrigerator where I had prepared the whole dosage plan ahead of time and put them into a plastic box with big lettering, "THIS IS ALEX'S MEDICINE - NOT CHOCOLATE!" We had a close call with my little sister - they looked appetizing to her as well! :) Now I use these for his vitamins and for anything that he has to take that is not appetizing. Really a life saver!

With pill pockets I even combine a few together and he LOVES it... he will even do his tricks to take his meds now and I'm not sure he even chews ha..

I highly recommend these for giving pills, powders or liquids (they are water proof for holding liquid med's also). If your dog/cat does not like the treats Greenies does refund your money.<br /><br />Nice product.

She thinks she's eating the same thing I am!  She is super fussy where treats are concerned and I have spent waaaay to much money to find snacks she will eat.  But, she loves the pocket pills for "dinner".  No, they're not really her dinner as she always has her food in her bowl.  I never give them to her just for a treat.  I'm so glad she loves them!!

review/summary: lifesavers
review/text: Because our dog is on 5 pills a day, down from 7, these pill pockets have been a lifesaver for us.  The dog loves them.  I was hesitant to try them given the one review about being distrustful of their composition so  I bought some from vet and used them side by side with ones from Amazon as a test.  I can find no evidence that these aren't genuine.  They are flexible, and the dog makes no distinction between vet's and Amazon's. We use a lot of these given number of daily pills consumed, and every package I've purchased has been fine. We purchase the large capsule size because some of dog's pills are quite large and then just pull off pieces of the pocket for the smaller pills.  I'll continue to buy them on line because of the difference in price with vet and because I can order in the middle of the night if necessary.

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: My dog Zoe recently has had to take 7 pills a day!  Instead of struggling with her to get them down, she actually DROOLS when I get the pill pockets out. I do recommend giving your dog a couple of them without the pill beforehand, because my dog usually spits out any new treat the first time, sniffs it out, chews it, etc.  Now she just gobbles it up. They easily mold around the pill, and I do follow the directions (not touching the pill pocket with the fingers that touched the pill).  Anyways, it's been a week, so hopefully the success will continue. GO PILL POCKETS! (lol)<br /><br />Edit: It's been 3 weeks, and still a success.  I don't even do the "not touching the pill pocket with the fingers that touched the pill" thing anymore.  Plus, I now break off pieces to fit around the small pills, and 1 large capsule pill pocket can be split to mold around 2 capsules, although this will vary in others.

review/text: I've been using Pill Pockets for 4 years now. I dont know why the other person had such a problem with hers.......but sometimes a few of them come crumbled in the bag....so what. You just smoosh it around your pill and the dog gobbles it down.  Maybe your's got crushed by the post office. I dont know. All I know is that regardless of what it looks like out of the bag, you can still use it. It doesnt stick to your fingers, it doesnt require refridgeration and the dogs love then.  There is a difference in the consistancy of the dough between the beef and chicken however. The Chicken is more like play dough dough, with the Beef a little stiffer like pie dough.  Either way, these things are a god send if you need to give pills on a daily basis.  It's a win-win product.

review/summary: Be careful, made my dog violently ill
review/text: I must admit these do work for getting your pets to take pills - 2 very finicky dogs who almost always spit out their pills in any food did scarf their pills down when put in these. However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours). It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this). The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see). Our other dog (adult) did fine, however. Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google "pill pockets diarrhea", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.<br />Would suggest trying just one of these (or half of one) each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds.

review/text: This may not be the best truffle oil out there but for the price, it's very good, especially for an avid home cook. This oil is very aromatic and the flavor stands up well in soups and other foods. I use it a lot in soups. The best part for me is that this is affordable enough to try on all sorts of dishes I make at home. I've had truffle oil infused dishes at fine restaurants and I think the biggest difference, for my palate, is that the more expensive oils are slightly smoother in after taste. My husband can't tell the difference. But that is mostly due to the type of olive oil used from what I've been told, which makes sense since olive oil taste varies from brand to brand (and quality!). Nonetheless, I think the Urbani White Truffle Oil is a great way to add that extra dazzle to meals at home without sacrificing taste or money.

review/text: I've used this particular brand of 'white truffle oil' to make truffle butter for my steaks.  I have also drizzled over popcorn for an amazingly new taste.  So if you love the smell of truffles, then you'll probably like this product.<br /><br />My gripe is with the labeling.  It makes it seem as if real truffles are somehow involved with this product, they are not.  If you look at the ingredients, there are two:  olive oil and white truffle aroma.  Well truffle aroma is just 2,4-Dithiapentane.  You are buying 'perfumed' olive oil that smells like truffles, or at least what most of us have been lead to believe truffles smell like.  So buyer beware, it tastes and smells great, but this is not a real truffle product.

review/summary: Very Good but could be Better
review/text: I bought this for my last birthday, thanks to a gift card I was sent.  I should say that for it's price, this is a perfectly decent brand of white truffle oil.  I use it for making omelets, sauteing vegetables and even as an ingredient for salad dressings.  If you like a garlicky white truffle flavor, this is a good brand and can even make a good gift, depending upon your budget.<br /><br />There is a bit of confusion.  When I read about this on-line, it says it is an infusion.  Other places both on-line and by the manufacturers say it is "truffle-essence."  There is a world of difference between these two things.  An infusion is easily the best way to try truffle oils, truly meaning that genuine truffles were infused with a high quality olive oil.  An "essence", on the other hand, generally means it's been made to taste of white-truffles, perhaps even using very synthetic methods.  This brand could be both and as a general rule I trust Urbani products.  Still, for a simple and less expensive oil used for general cooking, this is good for its price-point.  I would generally recommend a truffle salt (with truffle shavings) for a more authentic truffle experience.

review/summary: Truffles without the expense?
review/text: Truffle oil  makes a wonderful addition to most chef's repertoire. It allows you to infuse the aroma and part of the taste of the truffle. I purchased a finger sprayer and use it to allow the oil to create a mist over simple dishes like ravioli/butter/capers/procusitto and parmesan.<br /><br />Most cooks are unaware that the product (infused olive oil) even exists. Used in the fashion above it can be misted in many recipes to add an exquisite taste at a reasonable price. Truffles can cost up to $400/lb making it an ingredient unavailable (unless purchased on line)and un-affordable.<br /><br />I am sure that I will return to buy more once my current supply exhasts.

The oil is very strong so not much is needed to add the taste and aroma to the meal or dish.<br /><br />Glad to see Amazon carrying this it can't be found in my local store.

review/summary: NICE..... white truffle flavor- affordably
review/text: The bottles are about 4 inches tall. Since I've never had white truffles before, I don't have much to compare them to, LOL.  But I wanted to try some white truffle oil, and this was affordable.  I'm planning to try some baked potato slices, and drizzle a bit on those (saw on TV cooking show). I tried it with some steamed clams, and it was ok.  If I find a use I really like for white truffle oil, I'll order again.  Prefer the black truffle salt I got at the same time.

review/summary: Very nice taste!
review/text: My husband had once had a mushroom truffle macaroni & cheese at a restaurant years ago. I've never eaten anything with truffle, but decided that since truffle mushrooms are hard to find, I'll try making the same dish with truffle oil. It actually turned out really good, even despite the dish being low-fat. There's no doubt I'll be making it again, with different dishes (I've heard you can use it for other pastas, etc).

review/summary: artificial
review/text: Prior to ordering I misunderstood what truffle oil is... I warmly encourage potential buyers first to google "truffle oil"--you'll discover that there's no such thing. The "truffle essence" put in this and other truffle oils is a synthetic ingredient, whipped up in a lab, that mimics just one flavor of truffles. The aftertaste this (and any truffle oil) leaves is chemical. In order to make it work in a dish, you'll have cover it with garlic and other seasonings: basically, hide the flavor.<br /><br />There are some oils available through Amazon in which actual truffles are infused, but the problem is that oil doesn't easily absorb real truffle essence, so the presence of authentic truffle flavor is very weak and nearly undetectable.<br /><br />If you like this artificial flavor, then the price is right ($). But if you want real truffle flavor, get the real thing ($$$).

review/summary: Very good, but very expensive
review/text: The white truffle oil seems to give an extra good flavor to salads, but this kind (infused), which is the real McCoy, (they have some made in a factory or lab) is very, very expensive.  Two bottles come in a package, but they are very small. The two bottles together are less than 1/4 cup of oil.  A salad for four persons would take an entire bottle and the cost is approx $8.00 per bottle plus shipping.

review/summary: Decent product! Returned the pig!
review/text: I'm a chemist and tried to order the chemical (thiol) used to make most of these truffle products, to no avail. Anyone wanna split a tank car full of smelly thiol? The product is decent and I use it in anything from salads, pasta, and popcorn, yes! popcorn, though it's not supposed to hold up very well to heating (volatile). My daughter wanted to have a pig as a pet. Noone else did. I thought if I could train it to find truffles (are there any truffles in Indiana?), I might be able to justify a pig pet. We borrowed a PB 5 month old female for a weekend. She proceedeed to bite my std poodle and was very aggressive. We returned her the next day. The recepient said "she's mean isn't she." Their dogs were bitten as well. I think she was just bored. Urbani truffle (infused) oil has probably saved me hundreds if not thousands of dollars in pet/vet bills and rescued me from years of trying to keep a pig amused. Thank you Urbani!<br />p.s. Can a pig be trained to find morels? I suck @ it. (former NY'er married to a Hoosier). Go Colts!!

Before purchasing this I was putting items directly onto my son's booster tray or using several small dishes, but this is a way better solution. There are seven deep wells, perfectly toddler-sized. I can put a few heaping spoonfuls of yogurt in one, some brown rice in another, diced squash, some chopped apple, steamed spinach.. a bit of this and a bit of that. The monkey platter approach is a great way to encourage small children to try a wide variety of foods without overwhelming them and this tray is PERFECT. It's also cute and easy to clean.

review/summary: Works, but expensive
review/text: Basically my title sums it up.  This works, so I like it, but I really wish it wasn't so expensive.  Something that also works are ice cube trays (if you don't have the ones with lids you can put them into a large baggie before putting in freezer or cover with aluminum foil) and spray the tray with Pam before filling.  It really does make it so that the frozen food pops right out.  The one nice thing about this tray over ice cube trays is that it freezes bigger cubes, but right now my baby only eats a little bit so smaller portions/cubes are actually better for now.

review/summary: Great product but not airtight
review/text: This product is a must-have for any parents making their own baby food and looking for an easy and convenient freezer storage solution. The 7 compartments can hold 2 oz each and the frozen food easily slips out of each compartment, thanks to the flexible silicone.<br />The only downside to this product, is that the plastic lid isn't airtight, despite claims that it is exactly that. Instead of the lid snapping onto the tray all around the edge and closing tightly, it only clicks into place in 5 different places, allowing air to get in and resulting in freezer burn. To prevent this I plastic wrap the tray before putting the lid on.

review/text: I am a mom concerned about BPA and wanted to find something I could safely use in the freezer, and found this one among others and I liked that this one came with a lid and they style of it is pretty cool.  The only thing I don't like is that when I am freezing things that are more dense, like my homemade rice pudding, they are hard to push out when they are still in their frozen form.  When I freeze the same thing in a traditional ice tray, I don't seem to have that problem (I think because it is flexible rather than ridged, the tray flexes rather than releasing the food)...  things that are more watery like frozen juice are not as hard to get out.  Over all, I like it, and it makes really fun round popcicles!

review/summary: Great product, but carries a bad odor
review/text: I have the Beaba baby food maker and two of the trays.  I also use my food processor to make food.  I have twins and make a lot of organic food to freeze.  I freeze the food in the trays and then transfer then to FoodSaver bags so they never get freezer burned.  The one thing I HATE about the trays is that they have a weird, unpleasant odor to them.  The odor does not smell like the foods I stored in them.  For the most part, I wash them by hand. I tried soaking them in vinegar and figured the steam from the dishwasher might help, but nothing gets rid of the odor.  When I first got the trays, I had to run hot water over them to pop the food out.<br /><br />Now that I've been using them for a while, I can easily pop the food out without water.  I do try to transfer the food as soon as possible b/c the seal on the trays is not perfect and freezer burn can happen if you let them sit for too long.  I do feel the trays are overpriced.  I have 2 trays and could easily use 2-4 more to freeze the batches I make.  It's annoying to have to keep rotating the food to try to freeze it before it goes bad.

review/summary: LOVE THIS PRODUCT!
review/text: We have 6 of these trays in various colors.  My husband and I both work and make our daughter's baby food instead of buying jars.  We make large batches on the weekends and having multiple trays allows us to make a variety of foods that we can then combine when defrosted during the week.  I love that they stack neatly in the freezer, have a lid (which a lot of other baby food trays don't have), and the frozen portions pop out easily.  Another reviewer wrote they use it as a serving tray for baby instead of many bowls--I will most certainly try that when baby is ready to feed herself.<br /><br />As a tip...the lid isn't completely airtight (as other mentioned) so I wouldn't recommend leaving the food in the tray until you're ready to serve.  We pop food portions out after freezing over night and store in labeled bags.  This is very handy for grabbing foods quickly.

review/text: I have several types of baby food molds and this is my favorite. It is soft and rubbery so I am able to push up from the bottom of the mold to remove the food. I don't like having to run hot water over the back, like I have to with my other molds, because I don't like tap water getting on the food. (I'm a little obsessive, compulsive) Just make sure not to fill the molds all the way to the top because the food expands and then you'll have food on the lid. Makes for easier cleaning if you don't get food on the lid.

review/text: I am a total sucker for kitchen gadgets, but this just goes too far. The price is insane for what is essentially a glorified ice cube tray, which does not work as well as your basic ice cube tray. It's difficult to get the cubes out of this tray, it has an odd shape that wastes space in your freezer, and it makes 2 ounce servings, which are fine if you know you want 2 ounces, but I prefer to make 1 ounce sizes so that I can combine different flavors, or make just 1 (or 3) ounces if my baby is not as hungry and I don't want any waste. The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because of the lid - that IS handy, I must admit. But you can buy ice cube trays with lids too, that will actually fit in your freezer and stack well. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. Okay, it IS cute. I wish it wasn't so cute...

review/summary: One of my favorite baby products
review/text: The Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray is one of our favorite baby products.  We use a steamer and a food processor to make baby food.  We put the food in one of these freezer trays, freeze for a couple of hours, and then pop the food out and store it in the freezer in Ziplock bags, labeled with the type of food and the date.<br /><br />I saw a previous comment that the serving sizes were too large.  Um, no they are not.  If you want less - don't fill the cup all the way.  Crazy how that works!  I fill the cups to the top, and my son eats almost the entire serving.  I am glad that the cups are as big as they are.<br /><br />Clean up is a breeze - we don't put it in the dishwasher, we just run it under hot water.<br /><br />To prepare the frozen cubes, I pop them in the microwave for 15 seconds - then stir.  Another 15 seconds, and another stir.  Sometimes, another 10 seconds if I want to serve it warm.<br /><br />Great product for those who want to make cooking their own baby food even easier.

review/summary: Worth the expensive price
review/text: I bought this product because I needed freezer trays and was trying to use up the remainder of a gift card I had. Im glad that I had the gift card to go towards this product because I know that it is very expensive. here are the reasons that I enjoy this product:<br /><br />1) I use it often, every 3-6 days. If I think about it like that then I feel like Im really getting my moneys worth<br />2) The silicone makes it not only easy to clean and durable but a breeze to pop food out without having to worry about breaking the device<br />3) I like that it has a lid, and for the most part I really feel like they did the best that they could to make the lid fit on properly and snuggly<br />4) The size of the cubes are perfect for my needs. they are a good helping size and I never need to feed my baby anymore at one sitting. I dont waste a lot of food, if any, and my baby doesnt leave wanting more<br /><br />suggestions to this product and its use:<br /><br />1) I have a small freezer, its not standard size and therefore things freezer burn in my freezer at double the rate. Due to this issue that has nothing to do with the product, I overfill these cubes so that the top is touching the lid and no freezer burn is able to form before I can transfer them over into a freezer bag<br />2) because the cubes are bigger I thaw them out the night before in my refridgerator so that by midday they are thawed all the way through and i can easy heat the food evenly from there.<br /><br />I gave this a four instead of five stars simply because they could have devised a snap lock lid system for the money they are charging and made this an overall outstanding item and also because the price point is a little high, Im sure that its not even close to that much money to put together some silicone! i think baby items should be reasonably priced so that even those that are a little less fortunate can enjoy quality baby products such as a way to freeze food.

review/summary: I love these, price aside
review/text: I got these as gifts and absolutely love them. Yes, you can use ice cube trays to freeze baby food & other things but these are so much more convenient for me since they're = a jar of baby food, plus the reason I really love them is that I have continued to use them all the time after we were done with purees. I have 19 month old twins & made all their purees & continue to make a lot of their food and freeze things ahead for easy defrost & prep at the end of my work day when we get home & they're starving.  I'm not sure why another person was trying to scoop the portions out with a spoon (?) but all you have to do is run hot water over the back side for about 30 sec and everything pops out no problem. I have the same issue w/ ice cube trays so I don't really understand the issue others have reported.<br />So, in addition to purees, I have frozen things like the following in these to = 1/2 or full portion sizes for my kids (depending on how old they were, obviously I need to defrost more of them as they get older): risottos, ground beef/turkey, small meatballs & sauce, mac & cheese, small portions of elbow macaroni (when they were younger & couldn't eat as much), and anything else really that can be smooshed into the container. These are things that would not work in an ice cube tray & freezing in a million containers or one big one is not practical, at least for me.<br /><br />It's too bad they're not a little more affordable but I do think they're great.

review/text: I have two.  I like this product for a few reasons and dislike it for only one reason.  This is a good product because it gives you perfect 2oz portions.  It is easy to clean and store and fit in the freezer.  The only down side is that the plastic scent is a bit strong and sometimes the food scent stays on it even after I wash it in the dishwasher.  Maybe it is because I do not take them out once they freeze and place them in ziplock bags.  I just leave the food in and take 1 or 2 out at a time.  I still make and store my little one her apple sauce even though she is a finger food baby and not a puree baby anymore.  I still use this product and recommend it.

review/summary: Used it twice, won't use it again
review/text: This tray is huge, bulky, and awkward in the freezer.  It makes 2 oz portions, which are fine if you want to feed your baby 2 ounces of the same food, but I like to combine one ounce of this with one ounce of that.  Also, the cubes are fairly impossible to pop out of the tray.  You can run it under hot water as other users have done, but that makes a big wet avocado-ey mess.  I prefer to use regular ice cube trays with some saran wrap on top!

review/summary: Great little freezer tray for baby food
review/text: The Beaba freezer tray is flexible and very easy to clean. It has seven slots which is a good amount of storage for a week worth of 2oz puree portions. I make a lot of food for my 9 month old boy and I like to use this tray to store various fruit purees. The top closes securely and feels like it wouldn't come off if dropped.

review/summary: GREAT BABY FOOD STORAGE!!!
review/text: I was just making my 7 month old son some brocolli baby food when I realized I hadn't written a review for the Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray.  I have two of them and I absolutely love them.  I make the baby food then freeze it.  If I have too much food and not enough tray space, I freeze some and then pop them out and put them in another tubberware container.  Whenever it is time for him to eat.  I pop one out, put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and we are good to go.  I even freeze my homemade rice cereal which makes it so much easier.  I would recommend this product because it is easy and cleans really well.

review/summary: Bebea Freezer Trays are FABULOUS!
review/text: We bought two from Williams Sonoma.  I loved them so much that when I saw them listed on Amazon, I bought another one.  They are perfect for making baby food and for freezing small portions of often used items like tomato paste.  I also froze 1 Tbsp portions to use when I cook.  Love this product!

review/summary: Useful but not perfect--and pricey
review/text: I like this item because it enables you to freeze baby food in larger portions than ice-cube trays, which is a good thing if your baby is a little pig like mine is.  My biggest complaint is that it is difficult to get the frozen items out of the tray once they are done.  I usually have to run it under hot water for a few minutes, which is not a big deal but just one more step.  Also, the price is very high for what this is.  I could use a second one but at this price I'll make due with the one I've got.

review/summary: Perfect storage for homemade baby food
review/text: This is the perfect storage for the baby food I make at home. I am a working mom, so time is not on my side when it comes to doing things for my son. But, it's important for me to make him healthy homemade meals and this container helps me by allowing me to make large batches of food on the weekends and fill them up for the freezer. I have 2 of these storage containers that are kept in the freezer with the food I prepare on the weekends. Each night, I pull out my son's food for the following day and allow it to thaw in the fridge. The flexible material makes it really easy to pop out one portion at a time. Highly recommend this food storage.

review/summary: Makes perfect serving-sized portions
review/text: This is the second Beaba freezer tray that we've purchased, and still use both.  We bought the second tray so that we can make and freeze more baby food at a time.  The tray makes perfect-sized serving portions, and clean-up is very easy.  We run hot water over the back of each cup for one or two seconds, and the frozen food pops right out.  We store the individual servings in ziplock sandwich bags, makes it really easy to grab his food for the day and go.

review/summary: yummy in pink
review/text: I've been making food for my 7.5 month daugher. so far, I haven't made enough bulk to fill up this food saver. And when she does eat, the amounts she's eating wouldn't even be half of the little serving size that is in this container. I cna't wait to use it when she's a bit older and eating more
