review/summary: Not a "medium" brew IMO
review/text: This coffee was very strong and bold (great is that is what you like) when brewed on the 8-oz setting.<br /><br />I would brew two 8-oz cups with a single K-Cup and mix them and even then it was a little more then what I preferred. I love Starbucks but was felt I was mislead by this item being labeled as "medium". I will try other Starbucks K-Cups in the future; Veranda Blend Blonde is on my to-try list.

review/summary: ****Not your typical Starbucks, but good****
review/text: Living in Seattle and using K-cups for over 3 years, I can attest this is a better tasting and more complex flavor than the "typical medium roast" choices and would argue with reviewers that this is a generic blend branded with the Starbucks name.  I would compare this to Coffee People Donut Shop (highly-rated and our personal home staple) with a hint of deeper roasted flavor.  We've tested virtually every available flavor and this ranks in our top 3.  My only complaint (deducted one star) is the high Amazon price since you can often find this 25-30% cheaper at your local franchises.  I've bought 2 cases so far and plan on reordering.

review/summary: Good, but Strong Cup of Coffee
review/text: These K-Cups make a good cup of coffee. As others have said in the reviews, it is stronger than what I would expect from a "Medium." I make these on the largest cup size on the Keurig, and it is still a little strong. However, you can tell that it is Starbucks (even if not quite as good as the in-store coffee).<br /><br />I didn't want to comment on the price of these, but as others have pointed out, they are a bit on the expensive side. However, if you drink Starbucks regularly, you should expect that, and it is still cheaper and more convenient than going to the Starbucks.<br /><br />I would recommend borrowing one of these from someone else or buying a small box of them to make sure you like it, before you buy the bulk package.  But if worst comes to worse, I believe they can be made drinkable (or at least you will be able to find someone else that will drink it, unlike other K-Cups that I have tried, which I could not even give away).

review/summary: Great quality, expensive K-Cups...
review/text: Price per K-cups get poor marks when assessing for "value"; however, in terms of quality there is an earthiness and flavor profile that far exceeds any regular drip brew that I have experienced for home brewers (with an obvious exception for french press coffee).  What I sacrifice in terms of increased per K-Cup cost is made up for in terms of quality.  I enjoy Starbucks, regardless of their corporate profile.  Going to Starbucks is likely to result in a $4-5 dollar cup of coffee; where as I sit here now and for just about a buck I am enjoying a natural, black cup of Medium Roast Starbies... Loving it...

review/summary: Packs a punch!
review/text: I came to the amazon site to find these because I hate going to Walmart and that's the only place I've been able to find them. As other reviewers have mentioned, they are much cheaper at the brick and mortar stores than here. I do want to warn and defend this house blend as an extremely strong cup of coffee without the Bold Roast of the French Starbucks.  I find every other k-cup I've tried (Green Mountain, Newman's, even Starbucks' breakfast blend)to be too watery even on the smallest cup setting but boy these really make it taste like I'm drinking a good strong coffee house cup of joe.  I brew these with a medium cup of water but I think they'd even work with the large size brew. Shame they're so pricey.

review/text: As a Starbucks gold card carrying coffee drinker, I was excited to finally see the arrival of Starbucks K-cups, but YUCK! These K-cups are VERY bitter. I am not sure I want to finish off the box I purchased. I still think their freshly ground coffee is excellent, but they missed the mark here. Maybe the grind is not right for the K-cup system yet? I am going back to my Nantucket Blend and Coffee House.

review/text: For whatever reason, the taste of the entire selection of Starbucks K-cups is average to below average, to actually bad, and the premium price for Starbucks K-cups everywhere (brick and mortar and on-line) is not only premium, but ridiculously so.  I feel half a buck for a K-cup is too high, and over six bits is close to offensive.<br /><br />Pass 'em up, and wait for the purveyors to stop treating us like dope addicts.  Get one of those K-cup single serve refillable filter cups and make your own.  I have two of them and they work great.  Plus, the coffee actually tastes like the real thing...<br /><br />Uncle Ron

review/summary: Usually love Starbucks, but.......
review/text: I was thrilled to see the K Cups finally available from Starbucks coffee....bought a few flavors. I can only speak to the French Roast, as it's the only one I've tried so far in K-Cup form, but it's WAAAYYYYYYYY too bitter. I've had it a hundred times from the shop or at home from the ground bag, so maybe it was a "bad batch" or maybe it develops something from the K Cup packaging, but it's definitely not the typical French Roast flavor I'm used to. I'll give it 3 stars because I'm so happy they are offering it in K-Cups now, and I'm crossing my fingers the flavor is right with the other varieties I purchased.....for review ONLY on the French Roast K-Cup, I'd have given 1 star only.

review/summary: Special K protein shakes
review/text: Have been on a diet for several months trying to lose a little weight and I was wanting some type of low calorie food that had the necessary nutrients.  Tried another protein shake prior to Special K's.  After purchasing several cartons of it, I tried Special K.  I have since been drinking two to four shakes everyday for a number of weeks and supplementing them with just a little solid food.  I drink the vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry and I like each of them.  To me they taste good and they leave no aftertaste.  I know each person's taste is a little different, but I would recommend them to another.

A Milky Way bar 81 calories, 3.1 grams of fat, 10.7 grams of sugar and .7 grams of protein. In essence this "protein" shake is nothing more than a high calorie candy bar in a bottle with added protein. Chew on that for a while!

review/text: As someone who is sensitive to chemicals in foods, I was very upset when Malt O Meal who mass produced Puffed Wheat stopped. The only other product available to me was Quaker, but that had BHT preservatives in it which set off allergic reactions.<br />Being desperated I tried Arrowhead Mills product and was so grateful it is just puffed wheat without anything else.<br /><br />For people who have eaten enough puffed cereals, they will know that some taste burnt and some are light puffed. This comes from a process where one company explodes the grain in puffing by heating the grain which toasts it and another more modern method which uses steam pressure.<br />It is either the heat or steam pressure which when released which causes the grain to "puff".<br /><br />Arrowhead Mills is the toasted type and it is very good. It also unlike the steam pressure or the old Malt O Meal type not as perfected in that it is a bit more crunchy like the original puffed wheat of a century ago.<br /><br />For those with allergies, I believe the toasting makes the product less inflamatory to the body in "killing" the oils, germ and hull which affect many people.<br /><br />The bags are small, but surprisingly one can get around 7 bowls of cereal out of them.<br />The puffed wheat is though like all puffed wheat in softening readily in milk, but as stated the packages I have the puffed wheat has a bit more texture like original puffed wheat.<br /><br />I was quite pleased with this product and hope to have it stocked locally. It was good enough for me to even consider purchasing puffed millet in the future.<br /><br />I hope this helps people in their decisions. God bless.

review/summary: Great product, best deal I have found for dry cereal! Love it!
review/text: Arrowhead Mills has been the best brand that I have used for puffed grain cereals and they are very consistent with quality and taste.  Weights are always reliable too, I have not had any underweight packages when purchasing by the case.  Highly recommend this brand.  While I love their puffed wheat, I also really like puffed kamut and puffed rice as well.  All are great products. So glad to find sugar-free cereals that taste great!

review/summary: organic puffed wheat
review/text: Good price and quality for puffed wheat.  I started ordering it through amazon because I couldn't get puffed wheat at my local grocery.  I suggest trying only 1 bag first to see if your family likes it. Also should consider how much cereal your family eats because the 12 bags last a long time.

review/summary: Yep. Stale.
review/text: Like several other reviewers have said, the bags I opened were stale. Despite the "best by" date being months in the future, the puffed wheat had the consistency of slightly damp styrofoam. And returns are not permitted, even the unopened bags. If you feel lucky, go ahead and roll the dice on this purchase...I did and lost.

review/summary: Not Organic :(
review/text: I really like this cereal. I have it almost every day for breakfast. It's unsweetened and doesn't seem to have that off taste that a lot of other puffed cereals have. HOWEVER, I wish Arrowhead Mills would make the jump and make their puffed cereals organic. It seems like every other product made by the Hain Celestial group is organic, except these puffed cereals! I like this cereal, but I would love it if I knew I wasn't getting any harmful ingredients or GMOs.

review/summary: NOT ORGANIC!!!
review/text: In search for a whole grain, organic, unsweetened, and unsalted cereals, I was happy to run across this puffed wheat.  It tastes good but not organic.  I read every single prints on the bag.  There is no mention of its being organic, which is important to me since being organic = non-GMO.  All Arrowhead Mills puffed products are advertised as "ORGANIC" but only the Kamut cereal has the organic seal.  I'm switching to kamut cereal.  I gave it 1 star to get other buyers' attention.

review/summary: Returns policy makes this a high risk buy
review/text: Check the return policy before buying this product. The returns policy is to refuse any return for refund after three days from the date of ordering the product - which with two day shipping means you actually have to open and inspect all twelve bags the day you receive them or you will be unable to get a refund. I did not realize this and tried to return mine, failing to meet this deadline by only forty minutes mind you, and was then stuck paying for twelve bags of stale product. I opened all twelve bags once I realized the first was soggy and stale and there wasn't a good bag in the entire shipment. But because I didn't find this out forty minutes earlier I was just stuck throwing the entire shipment away along with my money. I have ordered this product twice before and it was fresh so did not expect this problem. But now that I realize the impossible inspection/return policy I will not risk this again. Too bad because it really is a good product when it's not stale. I give this one star for the inspection/return policy alone. After all, why would anyone open all twelve bags on day one in the first place? It would just make all the bags go stale right away before you even want to eat them.

review/summary: A real treat
review/text: These shakes are delicious and you can enjoy them practically guilt-free.  They're sweetened with sucralose (Splenda) instead of aspartame (Nutrasweet), which can make a big difference.  There are more side effects reported with aspartame, and many people who experience symptoms like joint pain may not realize the connection to aspartame. I am much happier with sucralose.<br /><br />The blender instructions call for 3 ice cubes, and it makes quite a thick shake. I look forward to a shake after each workout, and instead of the instructions on the box I add extra ice cubes and a scoop of protein powder. Sometimes I add yogurt or fruit to the vanilla shake too. For a mocha shake use cold coffee instead of water, or add instant coffee crystals.

review/summary: Delicious! I have all five Tisano teas... Fragrant, Chocolatey, and Lush
review/text: Updated May 2012.<br /><br />I wanted to update this review because I wanted to compliment Tisano on all of the teas - I have now ordered and tried all of them!<br /><br />I want to highly recommend all of these Cacao Teas- they are particularly delicious! I am fondest of the pure Cacao tea, but the Rooibos, Dragonwell, Mate, and Hojicha are all amazing as well.<br />You can't go wrong.<br /><br />I am impressed! Tisano teas are absolutely delicious. Simple, organic ingredients - the Rooibos one is just Cacao shells, Rooibos, and vanilla beans.<br />Every time I open the tin, the fragrance is very lush - like a fine bar of chocolate.<br /><br />I have been using my french coffee press to make my Tisano cacao tea. Its very easy to make - just measure out the amount of tea you want, and pour freshly boiled filtered water into the press, which releases the most beautiful fragrance!<br /><br />The taste of the Rooibos tea is very lush - so chocolatey but with the added complexity of rooibos and vanilla. I added some milk to mine and it is just delicious.<br />It is also excellent all by itself.<br /><br />The Dragonwell is clean, simple, flavorful and just perfect. I love the Mate Cacao blend most for when I am studying - Mate really helps clear the fog out in your head!<br /><br />The Hojicha is just what you would expect - gorgeous - chocolately, kind of toasty. Perfect.<br /><br />Tisano has a good thing going!!<br /><br />P.S. They have excellent customer service. I had a handwritten thank you note from the company's founder, Patrick, written on my packing slip, thanking me for being a repeat customer, and a sample package of some chocolate nibs, which might be my favorite thing on earth : )  Plus, he's good looking, what more could a girl ask for?<br /><br />Thanks Patrick!!

review/text: Ever since I got introduced to rooibos back in 2003, I've been a fan.  There are a lot of blends of rooibos + something else floating around these days. I always thought that I prefer the pure version over the blends until I tried this Tisano.  Cacao turns out to be a perfect complement to rooibos, softened by a hint of vanilla.  With a touch of milk, it makes just about a perfect cup of rooibos / chocolate tea.

Didn't have to wish so hard...the product is EXCELLENT! Kept my appetite in check. Won an online fitness transformation contest(thanks not only to my Venus Index workout program but to Tisano as well.) THis should be a part of every dieter's cabinet!

I used to drink Republic of Teas Chocolate line but after trying Tisano, I have switched my allegiance! Republic's tea line never satisfied my chocolate tooth. But tisano's does!<br /><br /> I used to be a binge eater. It's a hard thing to manage and I probably will always suffer from those desires. Tisano tea...helps alot.

review/summary: Tisano Dragonwell Green Cacao Tea
review/text: Oh, wow, this tea is sooo yummy.  I have been a fan of the original Cacao Tea from Tisano for a while now and have eagerly awaited their new flavors.  I was so excited to see this Dragonwell Green Tea available and ordered it from Amazon right away.  I have to say, I have tried dozens and dozens of so-called "chocolate teas" and none of them compare to this.  I love that chocolate is the first flavor I smell and taste and it isn't overpowered by the green tea, which I find is the case in many other chocolate teas.  I have also discovered what a great value this tea is, as it resteeps very well, so I am getting multiple cups out of a single teaspoon of the loose leaf tea.  Their customer service is also amazing; not only did I recieve my tea within a couple of days of ordering, but I also got a personalized note from the owner, and a free sample of nibs (delicious!), like a previous reviewer stated.  Great customer service goes a long way with me, and I am definitely a customer for life!  I CANNOT wait to try their Rose Tea infusion when it becomes available!

review/text: I thought I'd give the tea powder itself a try. I heard it was more condensed and packed more of a punch than the bags. Personally, I liked it and can see how it would be ideal should one have a tea maker (like a coffee machine), but with the coca tea overall it doesn't really effect me--energy wise--as much as regular tea does. I do, however, appreciate its flavor. It's a welcome change-up as compared to black tea. I should note though that I'm not sure it is worth the price premium we have to pay for it here in the USA.

review/summary: Great iced tea!
review/text: We came back from our trip to Peru with a hankering for more Coca tea and it wasn't long before it occurred to me to toss some in my iced tea maker.  What came out was really quite a nice iced tea with hints of cocoa in the flavor, a nice rich earthy flavor.  I've been making nothing but coca iced tea ever since.  I like this particular variety because it comes in a nice sealed tin, it has a nice fresh green color and strong flavor.  The powder works nicely in my iced tea maker, one heaping teaspoon makes a moderately strong batch of iced tea.  The built in filter filters out the powder so I'm not picking it out of my teeth. I add a small spoonful of NuStevia to sweeten it a bit (I've been living in the South for a while now) and the result is amazing.  Best of all, it gives me a little energy without any caffeine.

Brighter the green color means that the leaves dried outside in the shade and were not exposed to direct sunlight what makes a high grade coca flour.<br />McMate is clearly bright Green!

review/summary: Good Tea
review/text: Aside from the price, which is due to transport and availability, this is one of the best deals you can find.<br /><br />Within the first minutes of drinking my first cup I could feel the digestive stimulating effects that normally come from drinking coffee. I could see how this could clear up the effects of altitude sickness.<br /><br />The taste is very good and mellow, it carries the flavor of coca tea leaves, but it doesn't taste as "leafy" or as "crunchy" as the dried leaves taste. Maybe it is because of the left over moisture in this powder. It is very fluffy and indents, rather than crunching and breaking down like the dried leaves. So it seems a bit more mellow flavored, especially with honey or a bit of cane sugar.<br /><br />It also gives a nice pep, better than the jittery and mentally anxious effects of caffeine, some baking soda can help extract the alkaloids into your tea. It's not quite as strong as the other tea bags I have gotten in bulk before, but I really can't tell, as it is powder. I would have to make a comparison by weight.

review/summary: Anyone knows.....
review/text: Anyone knows that if you are going to bake a country ham, you need to soak it.  Soak it in something that will allow the water to cover the ham.  Soak it for 2 days, changing the water twice per day.  I soak mine in a cooler and put some ice in it to keep it fresh.  When I was a chef in a restaurant, I would soak them in the walk-in, still remembering to change the water twice per day.  If you are going to fry the ham and make a red eye gravy, I would slice the ham and only soak the slices for a couple of hours, pat dry and then fry, making sure you do not fry it too much.  If you do, you will find that it becomes extraordinarily salty.<br /><br />For the person who wrote the review in January of 2012, I would suggest two things.  Make sure you read a recipe when you start using a new product, and number two, do not become intoxicated before you type.

review/summary: Aging in an Attic does not help ham at all.
review/text: Everyone knows that basement aging is better for the ham. Attic aging is dangerous, especially since the insulation up there can leave *glass shards* in your ham. Steer clear of the glass shards and you'll be fine. I pick them out with scotch tape which I tap all over the ham before cooking. Otherwise its an excellent product.

review/summary: Actual sugar
review/text: I love this gum. It's one of the few (or only) non-xylitol or similar sugar free ingredient based gums. That stuff gives me a stomach ache (and worse) so I can't chew anything that has it.<br /><br />Luckily there's still Freshen-up. This gum is still made with real sugar and is pretty close to the gum you may remember having as a kid.  Finding an ingredient listings online has proven difficult, but not impossible.<br /><br />The following is off my pack:<br /><br />Ingredients: sugar, glucose syrup, gum base, invert sugar, (some packs contain glycerin, my current case does not list it), artificial and natural flavoring, soy lecithin, red 40 lake and bht (to maintain freshness). Contains sulfites.<br /><br />Made in Brazil, distr. by Cadbury Brasil Industria[...]/Cadbury Adams USA LLC (that's an abbreviated version of the distribution companies, but I like to know where things come from before I buy them, maybe you do too.)<br /><br />I hope this flavor (and brand!)  will always be available. I've also bought the spearmint which is very tasty but not bubble gum. The kid in me can't help blowing bubbles sometimes and that's not possible with the other flavors.

review/text: Now that my daughter is 2, I really appreciate that the HappyTot pouches really seem to keep the toddler's needs in mind, by offering a good size portion pouch for them, great flavors and especially this one, is my daughter's favorite in the veggie options.  I tasted it too since the combo of Sweet Potato, Apple, Carrots really seemed like a "Thanksgiving" meal to me and wow, it was! It's like eating a pureed version of the Thanksgiving Meal side dish!  I loved this side dish with my Turkey so it's so funny that my daughter does too.  Chock full of Vitamin A, being organic and all veggies and fruits, it's a great snack for her and meal supplement to her other foods.  The portability is perfect and that extra dash of cinnamon, makes me have a great respect for the company which shows how they really want the product to be tasty while maintaining the healthy offerings too!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VBPN2">HAPPYBABY Happy Tot - Stage 4: Sweet Potato, Apple, Carrots and Cinnamon, 4.22  Ounce Pouch (Pack of 16)</a>

review/summary: A good source for this distinctive and unique spice
review/text: Piment d'Espelette is a unique product.  It is subject to Appellation d'Origine Controlee regulation, which extends the right to use the AOC label only to ten communes in the Basque country in France.  The peppers are grown, harvested, dried and prepared subject to strict regulation and, like wine, cheese and other products subject to the AOC, must display the typical "organoleptic characteristics" of the traditionally produced spice.  Piment d'Espelette is never strong or screamingly hot, so if you are expecting something akin to Scotch Bonnet peppers, or the acrid bite of "chili pepper" blends, look elsewhere.  However, it does have a sweet and smoky aroma, akin to good pimenton or paprika, along with a distinct peppery 'bite' at the finish.<br /><br />Piment d'Espelette is never inexpensive and it is usually not easy to find in the US, so having this source available is great.  I use it in almost everything -- for example, peel and slice cucumbers, toss with a good quantity of freshly squeezed lemon juice (Meyer lemons preferred), a pinch of sugar, a large pinch of fleur de sel or kosher salt, and a pinch of piment d'Espelette.  Let the cukes sit in a colander for up to half an hour, tossing occasionally, then serve.  Trust me, you will not fail to notice the presence of the piment. It's also great and sufficiently assertive to dress a good sized composed salad with just a pinch in a basic vinaigrette dressing of lemon juice, white wine vinegar, dijon mustard and grapeseed, walnut or olive oil. Wonderful sprinkled lightly over a platter of carved "rotisserie chicken" from the grocery.  Adds a nice edge to rillettes or a terrine.  Adds pop to scrambled eggs, quiche... just think of anything you'd like to lend a subtly sweet, smoky and hot red peppery note, and give it a healthy pinch of piment d'Espelette.<br /><br />Another reviewer reports that he received piment d'Espelette from this source ("Touch of France") that was tasteless.  I've not had that experience.  I received very fresh piment with the AOC labeling, with aromas and flavors that are perfectly "typique."  If you really want to get "fresh," you could go with the whole dried, corded peppers which are also sold subject to the AOC (corded by hand with no fewer than 20 peppers per cord).  I like the convenience of the ground piment and recommend this supplier without reservation based on the product I received.  The price is about as fair as one can find nowadays, and I bet you can double up on the order for a single shipping charge.<br /><br />For more about piment d'Espelette generally, you can google piment d'Espelette and you will find the "Site officiel de l'AOC" (alas, for some reason the good folks at Amazon would not allow me to include the URL in this review).

review/summary: It's in the "lick the plate clean" dog food category
review/text: According to research I did before selecting a kibble brand to accompany wet food for my 23# boston terrier, this is a good quality dog food that my dog likes.  (I think she would inhale it if given the whereforall to do so.)  I see quality dog food as either:  good or bad and, if good, either "lick the plate clean" good or "better than nothing" good.  My doggie puts this food in the "lick the plate clean" good category so what more can I say?  (If looking to supplement online orders with local purchases, I recommend you check around to see how far the nearest Merrick Foods supplier is from your home as not all pet food stores carry it and I've yet to see it in any big box or grocery chains.)

review/text: Ricotta cheese is awesome when placed in lasagna.  True story- a few months ago my dad made a huge tray of lasagna for his girlfriend and myself, and he literally dumped the entire container of ricotta in the tray.  I thought it was too much but didn't say anything.  I didn't dare question my dad's experience in cooking for years and years (over 30 to be exact) at several different restaurants.  Anyway the cheese gave off a VERY strong taste, and in fact, it was the *only* thing we tasted in the lasagna, lol.  The sauce, other cheese varieties and everything else practically disappeared.  Still, I love the taste of ricotta cheese enough that I really would have trouble complaining about an abundance of it.  I find it's quite delicious.  Just be warned- use it accordingly and not the entire container (or in this case, bag) in one go, haha.

review/text: This bar gets smaller and smaller and smaller; it's almost a joke.<br /><br />It would be interesting to see the OZ per bar when they first marketed compared to now.  They do a great job of hiding the product size and making it seem insignificant.<br /><br />Strategy: Make a great tasting bar.  Get people loyal with special pricing on the boxes of bars in the grocery stores.  Then, shrink the size, one step at a time, while keeping price the same.  Most won't notice.  We certainly did.<br /><br />Very disappointed, will not buy this bar or any other Nature Valley products in the future due to this deception.

review/text: Pros:<br />(1) Tasty! That's the main reason I bought it. Love the melted peanut taste. Addictive! Yum.<br />(2) Well, because it's small, it's easy to carry around. Lovely dessert.<br /><br />Cons:<br />(1) The bar gets smaller and smaller, while the price stays the same - as other reviewers have pointed out. It's almost half the original size now.<br /><br />(2) I consider it an unethical business practice to mail out products with an expiration date in 2 months, and fail to disclaim this piece of critical information in the description. The vendor should not sell nearly-expired products like this!<br /><br />(3) Please note that there are many ARTIFICIAL COLORINGS used in this product, and there is PALM OIL used.

Right now, I can buy them cheaper at a local store and I will do that as long as the price is lower. If the quality was equal to that of my local store, I would still order through Amazon for the convenience.

review/summary: Tasty but peanut covering is messy in the heat.
review/text: The beauty of store bought prepackaged granola bars is that they are convenient and are usually non-sticky/messy compared to homemade ones.<br /><br />Nature Valley has always made some excellent bars that did not melt into a soggy mess when stashed in the car or brought on extended roadtrips/hikes/camping in the warmer months.  However, this new line of bars from Nature Valley features a sweet peanut coating similar to the yoghurt coating pretzles are dipped in.  This coating is quite sweet and melts in the heat.<br /><br />I would not reccomend particular Nature Valley line for outdoor activities in the warmer months, but would not hesistate to for the winter months.<br /><br />It is also a great treat to get kids off candy bars and into healthier granola bars as the sweet coating is quite peanuty and sweet enough.  The bar itself does contain crisped rice that their original crunchy line does not, but it is still a vast improvement healthwise over other more common snack bars available.

review/summary: An excellent workout snack
review/text: I'm a personal trainer and often my clients arrive in the late morning or afternoon needing a calorie boost to get them through a tough workout.  The combination of sugars and peanuts are just the ticket.  The Nature Valley Fruit and Nut bar is also excellent.

review/summary: Was looking for a tea with hibiscus as first ingredient
review/text: Because I read somewhere that hibiscus has more antioxidents than green tea.  This tea has that as the first ingredient and I love cherries, so I thought I'd try it.  It's delicious!  No sweetener needed and it's great tasting cold or hot.  You could probably even get kids to drink this as an iced tea in the summer!

review/summary: Fast easy treat, Not so great taste
review/text: This is so easy to make - add a little water, stir, put in the microwave, and you're good to go. It's very high fat though, and the taste isn't as good as baked items. We tend to put a lot of ice cream or whipped cream on it to help the taste, but that just adds to the fat content. I'd encourage anyone to try a single box from their grocery store before being this large package to make sure you like it.

review/summary: a good treat
review/text: Not the greatest thing in the world.  But for what it is, it's not bad, a good treat.  Though definitly not worth the $59.99 plus the $11.64 shipping, price tag.

review/summary: Only for the desperate
review/text: I'd keep these on hand for emergency food prep only, the exact situation we faced (snowed in, couldn't get to store). Luckily, we still had power during the snowstorm so we made the product as instructed.<br /><br />One tip here: remember that microwave ovens all cook at different temps and speeds, adjust cooking time accordingly. This should be gooey and not hard as a rock. We had two packages and had to test one before finding the right cooking time.<br /><br />The taste: Totally disappointing. While we all wanted a sweet treat, this barely met our needs, providing only calories and some energy, making me qualify it as suitable for "emergencies only". As far as providing a taste of sweetness, yes, this was fine. However, it fell far short of the "warm delight" promised by the cover photo and title. There was a decided hint of preservatives and some unpleasant flavors, creating an unsatisfactory culinary experience. No one expects a microwave mix to be high cuisine but this was barely palatable.<br /><br />We don't have gourmet standards by any means but this was not liked by anyone in the family, although the adults managed to eat our portions. The kids? Forget it.<br /><br />However, although I couldn't find them here, we DID try some mixes during the snowstorm that exceeded our expectations. One was Better Homes and Gardens Chocolate Chip mix. If you can find it, get it. It not only came in a lovely container but included the bonus of a year's subscription to BH & Gardens for only $5.00,  a bargain rate (optional, not required to subscribe to buy mix ). The mix in container cost $5.99 so we felt this was a better use of our money, leaving us with a reusable and microwavable container and tasty cookies for the $5.99. If we wanted, we had a monthly  magazine for another $5.00. You do the math and conduct a taste test and I think you'll agree that "warm delights" aren't so delightful. Just a thought.
