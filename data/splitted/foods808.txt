review/text: I absolutely love these shortbread cookies.  Unfortunately my store is out of them and doesn't know if they'll get them back in stock.  They are plain shortbread...not flavored.  I would order the butterscotch if I knew the nutrition count was the same.  Could someone give me the nutrition count on the flavored ones?<br /><br />The plain ones are:  76 cal,  2.5 fat,  5 carbs,  less than 1 protein,  0 fiber.  Serving size 3 to 4 cookies.<br /><br />On weight watchers these are only 1 point a serving.<br /><br />Thank You,  Eileen

review/summary: It's key-lime-time!
review/text: If you're looking for something to serve at your next afternoon tea, you've just found it! These cookies are premium key-lime pie in finger-food form. The texture is light and slightly crunchy, with a moderately sweet and somewhat tart key-lime flavor. They're truly sinful and addictive. For this reason, buy these only if you intend to share, lest you'll find yourself devouring the entire box in one place.

review/summary: Very tasty, but difficult to separate out!
review/text: I have been eating these for years, and just love them for soup, especially a clear chicken broth type soup. The only drawback that I have found to them is that is virtually impossible to separate out the Palestinian from the Israeli content. I obviously assume that because they are made in Israel, there must be some Palestinian content, even if it is only the work involved in growing the wheat to make them. It would help if the manufacturer could help in making it easier for the consumer to separate out the Palestinian content in this product.

The bone is still a hard plastic type material that does splinter and form sharp shards that cut the dogs mouth and catch on everything. Not really happy, was hoping for a different material that doesn't do that. So it is over rated and not what I had hoped for.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: I orginally found this product after complaining to Nylabone.  I had bought one of their 'Pit Bull Tested' toys - some knobby thing -  for my half pit bull mutt.  He enjoyed the knobby thing but it was in tiny bits in under 5 minutes.  I pulled the package out of the trash and emailed nylabone with a complaint.  Much to my surprise they responded the next day and sent me the Galileo Souper bone at no charge. My dog loved it.  Nylabone later paid my dog $25 to test a new and improved 'knobby' product but it didn't last either.  However the Galileos are great and we keep buying them.  We get about 9-12 mos out of each one before they get down to plum size.  They keep his teeth nice and clean too.  The floor does tend to vibrate when he grasps it with his paws and start gnawing (wood floor over a crawl space) which is a little odd but does impress visitors :-)

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: We've had dogs that wouldn't have a thing to do with Nylabones, but what works great is early training.  Start the puppy out on the puppy nylabones.  Follow instructions and help the pup's interest level by smearing some peanut butter on it, and so on.<br /><br />The first time we saw a Galileo Bone,  we were mystified,  but the sales clerk said he had one and it lasted years!  And guess what?  It did!  Our dog is over 8 years old now,  and has two Galileo's.  He doesn't chew on them constantly,  but whenever he feels like it.  It helps keep his molars free of tartar and satisfies his craving to chew.<br /><br />One of the bone's 3 tips was getting chewed waaaay close to the stump and finally broke off.  According to instructions,  that's the time to retire it and get a new one.<br /><br />I've paid over $20 each for these and feel they were worth it at that price.  Now they are almost half that.  Good deal.<br /><br />Natural (real) bones are dangerous and rawhide chews can get stuck in the throat,  swell in the stomach and even cause bowel impaction.  Don't use them.  If you insist,  supervise the dog so you can assist if the above problems happen.  It has happened to us.<br /><br />But use Nylabones and don't worry about it!  It may take some training at first,  maybe not.  If it does,  it's worth it.

review/summary: Great Choice for Tough Chewers
review/text: We have a half Rottweiler that is a very tough chewer. When he was a pup he destroyed nearly every toy we tried to give him. I was concerned that he would swallow something he shouldn't, so we had to take away the toys. Then we found the Galileo Nylabone and the black Kong toys. These were a blessing, as no matter how hard he would try, he couldn't tear them up. The Galileo Nylabone is designed so that it just comes off in little shreds - nothing big to swallow. Our Rotty has been chewing them for nearly 10 years, and still likes them. He gets excited when we give him a new one.

review/summary: Best toy for an aggressive chewer
review/text: My 70lb pitbull mix can chew through just about any toy.  I dream of the day when I find him a soft chew toy that outlasts his jaws of steel, but for now, the only toy I found that lasts for a substantial amount of time is the Galileo Nylabone (Souper size).  He has two that he has been chewing on for about 2 years now and while he has certainly been able to chew away a bit of them, for the most part they are still intact.  He actively searches out his Nylabone at least twice a day and chews on it for no less than 20 minutes at a time.  The nice thing about this toy is that you NEVER find large chunks of it coming off while they play---just as the company describes, nothing larger than a small grain of rice ever comes off during a chew period.  Once in a while, to sterilize the toy and to add a little 'wow' factor back into it, I boil it in a big pot of water containing a couple chix boullion cubes---he LOVES this!!!

review/text: This is the best bone/best toy investment I have made for my dogs.  I have an 11 month old airedale mix puppy and my boyfriend's dog, a chocolate lab/ german shorthaired pointer mix that is almost four and they are constant chewers- they love and destroy almost every other bone, but these are awesome.  After my puppy went though some of the other nylabones, I decided to spend the money and get the galileo- it was completely worth it.  She has had one bone four about five months and its not completely dead yet- I bought another one and the largest size for my other dog- they love them. These are not light chewers.  The larger dog can make mince meat of a frozen beef rib bone in under five minutes, and  my puppy has only been beaten by this bone, and one of the other 'souper' nylabone chews. They carry around and chew on them for at least a half hour every day, and these bones can take it!  Definitely keeps their teeth clean and their breath fresh.

review/text: My little boxer-pit bull mix has chewed through every "durable" toy there is.  I got her the "wolf" size Galileo and had to help her start it (it's slippery before they scratch it up) but now she loves it.  If you have a dog that can chew the other durable Nylabone products down to a nub then this is for you!  It doesn't even seem to matter that it's not flavored (at least not to my knowledge).  I would also recommend the Nylabone Double Action Chew - this one has also lasted far longer then the Nylabone durable regular bones.

review/summary: An Anecdote...
review/text: I'm not sure if it's a defect in the product or my dog, who is nicknamed "Shredder".  It took my dog 3 days to completely mar this bone, and another month to disfigure it enough that you can't tell it's a bone anymore.  On the plus side, this is the longest lasting chew toy I have ever bought for her, and she hasn't chewed all the way THROUGH it yet.  A good product, just not EXACTLY as tough as it's marketed to be.

review/summary: 3.5 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: Man it was time for a new Nylabone. Mom and Dad bought me my first two almost 5 months ago! They were looking a little nasty, but I still loved them. The kind folks over at Nylabone sent me a gift box and I got to try out this new monster of a chew bone. Now it is shaped a little weird, but I like it none the less. Every time Mom and Dad eat lunch or dinner I lay down and chew on a Nylabone. It keeps me entertained while they eat that amazing smelling human food... I just close my eyes and pretend.<br /><br />Conclusion: Great chew bone! Lasts a very long time. Not sure what could be improved.

review/summary: Great toy for dogs who can really chew
review/text: The first time I purchased this nylabone I paid full retail (around $10+) and thought I must be crazy to spend that much on something I'm giving to a dog to destroy. Now that I have seen how long it lasted (and with regular use) and see how much dogs enjoyed it, I realize it's worth the cost. What a waste of money it has been to get them cheaper chew toys that claim they are for aggressive chewers, but lasted, in some cases, only 5-7 hours total. It would have been just as easy to crumple five-dollar bills and throw it at them.<br />By comparison the orig. Nylabone I bought has outlasted all the other chew toys by 3 years (and there is still 1/3rd left) and that's with TWO dogs chewing on it(25 pound dogs) I recently purchased several new ones because the piece that's left on the orig. is getting too hard for them to hang on to.<br />Fair warning -- do NOT step/trip on one of these Nylabones w. bare feet! I don't know how the dogs can stand it, but those chewed edges can get really sharp. I stubbed my foot on one once and it drew blood!!

review/summary: Decent chew but does not beat antlers
review/text: We have two year old pit bull mixes and a 5 month old APBT. They seek and destroy all squeaky and stuffing toys within a matter of minutes, so we tried different nylabones. We try to rotate their toys to prevent boredom, but one of our dogs loves to hide the bones before we can snatch them away. The odd shaped bone lasts longer than the traditional bones, but they lose interest a lot quicker too. We stick to the big nylabones and antlers now.

review/text: I thought this toy looked a bit odd and boring. I wasn't sure my dog would like it. But, she does. Toys do not last around here. My dog chews up most toys I try to give her right away, but I gave her this about a month ago and she still hasn't completely chewed it up, but she has bit off a few very tiny pieces. When I purchased this I also got two other toys and they are lasting much better. I recommend the Nylabone Double Action Combo Bone Chew, Wolf, and the Nylabone big chew knot for big dogs.

I have been on a never ending search to find a chew toy that would clean their teeth, yet not cause a intestinal blockage. About a Month ago I purchased a tan NAT GALILEO-SOUPER - Large. I could not believe my eye's when it lasted longer than five minutes. Now a month later and it has still managed to hold our dog's intrested and it has withstood the intense chewing. If you have a dog with powerful jaws you will find this product satisfy their need to chew.

review/text: This is the most durable nylabone so far.  My dog chewed through all the other ones in no time at all.  The galileo souper does the job.  He started this about 3 wks ago and the wider end is now half flat.  Once he started on it, the bone will create it's own bristles which clean his teeth.  He loves it and will be chewing on it for an hour straight.  If they made one that was a little longer, it may be easier for larger dogs to grab ahold of.  Overall, satisfied.

review/text: Got two Jack Russells here and my guys love these bones, almost better than marrow bones. They chew on them ALL the time and they rarely cut their mouths on these bones. For dogs that seem uninterested, it might be useful to ding them up a bit (drop them on the pavement a couple of times) to get them started. One of these (wolf size) will probably last a couple of years for my guys. They do leave tiny white pieces all over the floor though.

review/summary: Your dog needs this
review/text: If you have a dog who likes to chew, you need this bone. We have a pitbull who chews for hours on end on this bone. After a year, we are finally replacing it. The shape of the bone is a little... strange... but after a week of chewing you won't notice the shape so much.<br />Pros- Will keep your dog very entertained. Cheaper then chewing on furniture or shoes. It lasts a VERY long time. Occupies your dog and gets extra energy out. Won't break in half. Can be rinsed off if it gets gross.<br />The cons- The pieces that are chewed off are small white slivers of plastic, they can get stuck in carpet or rugs and take a few run-over's with the vacuum to get them up. After a week of chewing, stepping on the bone is worse then stepping on a lego.

review/summary: Great for Powerful Chewers
review/text: I have three large mixed breed dogs who are extremely powerful chewers and after much trial and error, I would never buy any other brand except Nylabone.  Nothing else lasts as long and occupies them as Nylabone does.  They always fight over this one in particular - perhaps they like it because it is much larger than all their other Nylabones.  This is definitely the largest one I have seen, so I would only recommend this for someone with a large dog.  I would recommend anything Nylabone if you want your dogs to chew a toy instead of your furniture!

review/text: I adopted my Yellow Lab, Colby Jack, in October of 2007. A Galileo Bone came with him and it has by far been his favorite toy. He has had it since Spring 2006 and by Fall 2011 he had managed to chew on the t-bone side down to what looked like a hatchet blade. In Novemeber, we adopted a 6 year old Pit Bull, Kratos, and he to has fallen in love with this bone, so much I just ordered 2 more in hopes that they will last as long as the first one has. Considering we are on year 6 of the original Galileo Bone, I HIGHLY recommened these bones for active chewers.

review/summary: The toy that lasts and lasts
review/text: I have two Rhodesian Ridgeback puppies (5mo & 10mo) and they LOVE the Galileo Bone in the "Souper" size. They grab it with their two front paws and will knaw on it for a half hour straight. It seems like it will last for a long time and the more they chew it, the more they enjoy it. It doesn't make a mess when they're chewing, the ends fray into something like tooth brush scrubbers, but don't break off.  I don't think the 5mo old would enjoy it as much if the 10mo old hadn't already started chewing it to create these scrubbers. It's probably best for dogs that have their adult teeth grown in. It would be too tough for the little one to knaw into a brand new one. I'm ordering a second one so they don't have to share it anymore! :)

review/summary: First impressions aren't everything
review/text: When I first opened this package I was disappointed as it is nothing like the other "bone" I have for my dogs to chew.  This is a very hard plastic and not all rubbery.  Being such a hard plastic, I was sure that none of the dogs would enjoy it at all.  I put peanut butter on it hoping that would at least get them to realize it was something for their mouths and handed it to our 6 month old Pitbull.  She licked the peanut butter off then went back to the old bone.  When my son took her to bed, he took the bone too.  The next morning I found the bone back in the living room and it had been gnawed on enthusiastically.  She loves it!  She's put hours in on it and it's nowhere near being chewed up yet - just chewed on.  Now when the yellow lab takes the kong and the chocolate lab takes the rubber bone, she has her own (very phallic looking) toy.

review/summary: Consistantly durable, sometimes painful
review/text: Our black lab puppy demolishes most toys within a few minutes. The only toys to stand up to her jaw so far have been this bone, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8">KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Large, Red</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050QBSKU">Hartz Ruff Rewards Dog Toy for Strong Chewers, Bacon Flavor - Large (50+ lbs.)</a>.<br /><br />We've had this bone for almost 4 months now, and it still has maybe another 6-8 months in it. She has only managed to get little specks off at a time, so it seems quite harmless. She'd go through other Nylabones much quicker.<br /><br />My only complaints are that as you get tougher with the Nylabones, they get harder (as opposed to a rubbery material like the Kong toys). So be prepared for a very solid, plasticky bone. I just weighed her bone (she was a little confused) and it was still about 10 oz. It doesn't seem like a lot, but it can definitely hurt when dropping-at-your-feet accidentally becomes dropping-ON-your-foot. It also makes quite a noise on hard wood floor. Finally, it gets very prickly as it gets chewed on, which makes it a little more painful when it meets your foot. But I guess this is a trade off for a durable bone when it isn't a rubbery material.<br /><br />So, overall we are happy with the bone. Our dog loves it (a little too much when we find it in our bed) and it has lasted a while. We'll probably buy another one when it's gone. It is just unfortunate that it is so heavy/loud at times.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful. Leave a comment if there are any questions I can answer about this bone. Thanks!

Both dogs love their bones (it was their Christmas present), and they have yet to make much of a dent. The dogs definitely make indention marks, but nothing more than scuffs from their teeth. I see these bones lasting quite a while and I look forward to it! :) Thanks Nylabone!

review/text: I have a very hard chewer and Nylabone is the only bones he gets, he manages to shave off very small pieces but nothing of significance, whatever he swallows go's right through him. They are more expensive than other bones but well worth it.

review/summary: Best Chew Toy!
review/text: We have used this product for many dogs over many years.  If your dog is an avid chewer and chews all its toys to pieces, then this is the toy you need.  We had a Lab who went through 2 of the largest ones every year.  Our current dog is about 25 lbs and loves this toy.  I think it is probably good for cleaning the teeth also.  The only caveat I have is that if your dog has a lot of flesh around the mouth (like a Great Dane)it may not be a good toy.  Use your judgement.  Otherwise, its the only chew toy I but!

review/text: I have a 7 year old Weimaraner and have been buying these bones for years!  She loves to chew and destroys every fabric toy she gets in seconds, so we were in search of something that would last a little longer.  I came across this bone and when she was a pup we would have to get her a new one about every 6 months, and to this day she still loves them! (luckily we don't have to get them as much, at her old age- lasts a year or longer now)<br /><br />Got it on amazon because I could not find them anymore, happy I looked here, price was the lowest I have ever paid!

review/text: I so want to buy nice squeaky toys for my two Bernese Mountain Dogs. But alas it is not to be. The male has been known to tear apart expensive, indestructible, for powerful chewers,you all the fun toys in minutes. Which leaves me nylabones or kongs. Both of them seem to prefer the Galileo to the other nylabone products. They chew after every meal and these tend to last about a year. There will be little white stuff on your carpets and also in their poop. The bones get sharp and are trip hazards but save the furniture and seem to be good for their teeth. My Berners give these two paws up !!

review/summary: Agressive Chewer Semi Satisfied
review/text: Saying my 7 month lab puppy is an aggressive chewer is an understatement.  She truly puts all toys through the ringer and will put others if given the opportunity.  That being said we have only owned this toy for 3 days and she has gotten very small I(smaller than rice sized) off the souper sized bone.  The product did say that this would happen so I was prepared and we only give this to her while we are home.  She has by no means broken it and we are hopeful that this chew will last a good while.  If this toy lasts 2 months it will pay for itself.  This is coming from the dog who has chewed through "agressive chew toys" by the age of 4 months.  We always go one size up and she still manages through them, and usually within the first day or to.  So so far so good. I will update in a month, but for now thanks Nylabone!

review/summary: Great bone for dogs who like to chew that never wears away
review/text: This is a great bone for dogs who love to chew as no matter how long, or how hard they try, they will never be able to wear out, or chew away, this bone.  My dog enjoyed chewing on his first Galileo bone, although it spent most of the time buried. After it was destroyed by a lawnmower, I bought this one.  However, my dog now has no interest in it.  Probably because it has no taste, and he knows that his chewing doesn't get him anywhere with it.  But for dogs who are getting this bone for the first time, they will be sure to enjoy it until they realize that their chewing is getting them no where.  Better than having them chew on everyone's shoes!

review/summary: Great But...
review/text: Best dog chew bone(s) ever made. They have been our bone of choice for many years.  ALL of my dogs absolutely love to chew them, however,  I do worry about the small sharp, jagged pieces of nylon that protrude from the chewed surface so, I pick the bones up after they have been chewed for about an hour.  That system works well.  As with most routines, the boys have learned that they will get to chew again tomorrow.  Yes, it is possible to take a bone away from a Pit Bull, a Labrador and a Shepherd.  Just make sure that the dog understands that the bone belongs to you before you lend it to him.  If you cannot pick up your dogs food bowl while he is eating, I would not try to pick up his bone while he is chewing!  My vet's only concern was about my Pit's teeth after the 11 year old chipped a tooth while chewing.  His chew sessions were reduced but he enjoyed the bones without incident until he died at 14.

review/text: Nylabone is just the best.  Our yellow lab has been working on this Galileo for well over two months.  Anything smaller for her chewing habits is gone in less than a week.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has a dog who gets bored just laying around and "wants to be doing something."  Best thing about these Nylabones are you can boil them in water to take away any smell that might come about with a little "age" if your dog likes to take their time with something this size.  The worse thing about this is that after constant chewing, you get the little "plastic spikes" that are created on the bone... and let me tell you what... this thing is NO FUN to step on in the dark when it has been chewed on-a-plenty!  Highly recommend!!!

I got two of these bones and the dogs love them! Took them a few days to start chewing on them, but now they go crazy for them. At the rate they have chewed threw these two, it will take well over 6 months to a year for them to need new ones. They really love them, and it's been the best investment for the dogs I've been able to make so far! Highly recommended.

This is far longer any anything else has lasted (stuffed toys > 5 min). I will buy this again if he ever wears it down.

review/text: This is a great toy for heavy chewers. I have a pit bull mix who has played with this toy for over a month now, and it is still in good condition. I didn't see how this large plastic object would be appealing to my dog, so I had peanut butter ready just in case. However, I didn't need it, as he chewed on it for a good hour the first time I gave it to him. He still chews on it from time to time, and aside from small particles that he chews off, the whole toy is still intact. I highly recommend this toy. I also suggest taking it away from your dog for a period of time so that when you give it back to him, he will still be excited to play with it.

We purchased this product last month, they chew on these things daily (I bought 2 of them), and there is still only teeth marks. They have managed to wear down one of the nubs on one of the bones but these things I'm predicting will last another 3-6 months if not longer. My rottie especially loves his galileo nylabone. Before, they flew through other products like rawhides in minutes. They chew on these things while we are sleeping, watching a movie, eating, etc. - great distraction for having guests or doing other non-doggie activities! I highly recommend these to anyone with dogs!

review/summary: Solid Chew
review/text: Though this is not my dog's favorite chew, I am still giving it a 5-star rating because it is quite solid and has held up to her chewing over the past 4 months.  Those of you living in apartments with hardwood floors should be aware that if the dog drops this toy, it will make a very loud 'thud' noise on the floor, which may anger those living below you.  Though my dog does not turn to this toy first, I have seen pictures of this toy after 12 months of abuse from "power-chewers" and was amazed at how well these toys held up to powerful pit bull jaws, which is why I am giving this 5 stars.  My dog prefers longer and thinner chew-toys, which might be why this is not the first toy she picks, however, she does not ignore it and it does get a fair amount of use.  I would not purchase again, as this is not one of her favorites, but I do encourage people to try it out with their dogs.

review/summary: A MUST for big dog owners!!!
review/text: We bought a Galileo for our Lab/Golden mix when she was about 1 year old. She loved that bone and it lasted for several years until it was misplaced while traveling. We bought her another one and she has had it for 8 years!! It's still in good shape and when it gets too messy, I toss it in the dishwasher (without soap) and wash it along with the dog bowls and other toys and they come out clean and ready to use again.<br /><br />I'm amazed at clueless dog owners who give their dogs stupid things to chew like old towels or old shoes or those horrible pigs ears and jerky chews. Dogs can't distinguish old shoes from new or an old towel from your cashmere sweater. It's like giving a human toddler a "toy" screw driver and electric socket set so they can practice sticking them together and then being surprised and upset when they use the real screwdriver in your wall socket.<br /><br />This Galileo should be a required purchase for anyone with a dog over 50 pounds. It entertains them, satifies their need to chew and it will save your furniture, your carpet,and you sanity. Get one for your friends with the problem chewing big dog. They will thank you.

review/summary: My dog's favorite bone
review/text: I bought my golden retriever his first Galileo bone about 4 years ago.  He *loves* this bone, and it is the only bone he has repeatedly gone back to over the years (and believe me, this spoiled dog has been able to sample just about every bone ever made).  It's impossible to break off large chunks, so it takes a very long time for it to wear down.  I finally just bought him his 2nd bone a few weeks ago, and the original one is probably still a third of its original size.  He chews on it 5-6 nights every week, while the rest of his bones collect dust.  I can't recommend it enough, especially for those "power chewers".  I don't know what they do to the bones to retain the flavor, but it works!  Don't let the expensive price tag fool you--they last for years.<br /><br />Update 10/5/10: Believe it or not, my dog still loves this bone!  I've gone through another two in the last few years, but how could I not have one for him?  He chews on it virtually every day.  I'm glad to see the price has gone down a bit since I first started buying them.

Her whole mouth was cut up from the "rice size" pieces that clean the teeth. Despite her mouth being massacred, she still chewed on the toy. I had to throw it away so she wouldnt hurt herself. I touched it as well and it was SHARP.<br /><br />What a waste of money. I still cant find any toys for my dog to chew without her  ripping them up or hurting herself..... sigh..

review/summary: Very Happy Dog
review/text: And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.

review/text: Dog loved this bone.  I think there should be a star section for price and value comparison.  I probably would have taken a star off for price, but I believe more in reviewing the product for the product, not the price.

review/summary: All my favorites in one bag
review/text: I recently received a complimentary box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> from the distributor. After sampling all of the flavors, I realized I really was a traditionalist and loved the fruit flavors the best.<br /><br />While the sampler comes in a beautiful box appropriate for gift giving, let's be honest, it only has 1/2 pound. And this bag has a full pound. Even more, it has a full pound of my favorites.<br /><br />While I do recommend that you try the sample pack for a well rounded experience, you won't go wrong with this package. Made with fruit flavors so real you want to check for seeds, the real flavorings and lack of artificial flavoring is a big plus for me, since I struggle with allergies in this area.<br /><br />David is the original creator of the Jelly Belly, and he has returned, better than ever with these. Where the jelly belly won our hearts with their intensity, these will win out with their true-to-life flavor. It is as though the originals were made for children, these were made for adults.<br /><br />If you are a soda fan, you might want to consider his other mild assortment <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBMAS8">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Soda Fountain Mix</a>.<br /><br />While I appreciated the complimentary samples, now I have a serious problem, I don't ever think I'll be able to eat the lesser varieties without comparing them. I  checked, and I can't buy them locally ... Yet ... But fortunately I can buy them here on Amazon.<br /><br />I really do appreciate good tasting candy, and while it is pricy, it is very good.
