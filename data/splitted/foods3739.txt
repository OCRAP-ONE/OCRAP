review/summary: Excellent if you don't read ingredients!
review/text: These are the same product as the Bite-Size in the smaller blue bag except that they're longer links and vary in length.<br /><br />The ingredient list is somewhat gross as it lists specific parts of the pig.  If you can get past that, the taste is unmatched!<br /><br />The Slim-Jim ingredient list was similarly disturbing to me as Slim-Jim has, as separate ingredients "chicken" and "mechanically-separated chicken."  I don't understand why one or the other doesn't cover both.

review/summary: Oh Boy! Oberto Cocktail Pep
review/text: Very tasty gourmet food. Easy to keep and store. Easy to prepare. Could be eaten as packed or warmed in microwave, toaster oven, frying pan or directly over flame or charcoal grille. Goes well with pasta and other spanish, italian or french dishes. Best with crackers and cheese, rice, or even eaten alone. Matches well with soda, beer, wine or any beverage for that matter. Perfect to take along during trips. They are so good, I panic whenever I run out of stock!

review/text: Ordered these for my diet. They are high in protein and only 140 calories per stick. They are great for a meal replacement as one stick will fill you up and keep you full for a long time. I have my stick during lunch at 11:30 with a glass of water and I am not hungry until dinner time at 5:30.

review/text: When we first bought these we tried to eat one and couldn't.  Looked at the ingredients and found its mostly pig hearts.  Taste is awful.  Our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell.  After about a week the contents of the bag start to mold.  Since they are for the dog, we washed them off and then store in the fridge.  Too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc.  Not recommended for people food.

review/summary: These used to be so much better
review/text: Oberto Cocktail Pep used to be so much better than this. I had been buying them direct from the Oberto online store for many years and I couldn't get enough. No matter what size I ordered they were always excellent.<br /><br />However, in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down. They used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them, the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly, and they had a superior spicy flavor.<br /><br />Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.<br /><br />Every year or so I get to craving those old style cocktail pep that I loved so much and I order a package hoping that they will have changed. I keep thinking, maybe I just got a bad batch last time, but every time I am disappointed all over again.

I knew something wasn't right as soon as I opened up the first bag and got a whiff. Then I read the ingredients and was shocked when I saw that they actually use pork hearts as the top ingredient. To eliminate any doubt, I tasted one.. we've been using them as expensive doggy treats ever since.

review/summary: Perfect Pod Coffee Pod Maker
review/text: I purchased this little machine after spending a fortune (.50) for each 8 oz. cup of coffee using the Senseo coffee pods.  This Pod Maker is marvelous!  Not only does it make pods using whatever coffee you like, it makes pods for an 8 oz. cup of coffee!  Senseo pods only make a 4 oz. cup of coffee, so you have to use two pods if you want to have a decent size cup of joe.  You fill the pod, fold over its top over the coffee, and then seal the pod in 2 to 3 seconds with the pod maker.  Incredibly simple.  I also have used the Ecopads, which are great also.  However, you have to empty and clean the Ecopads each time you use them.  It also takes 2 Ecopads to make 8 oz. of coffee.  The Perfect Pod Coffee Pod Maker is the better choice.

What a savings and making your own pods is fun. Marvelous invention. Hats off to the inventor!

This lil machine allows me to brew a double (8 oz) cup using only one homemade pod made with my own favorites. This includes teas. I just enjoyed a cup of green tea made with loose tea leaves in a perfect pod. Works great.<br />This will allow me to get the most out of my Senseo coffee maker. I also have the larger water reservoir so I don't have to refill it after every other use.

Can't buy those in the store<br /><br />The sealer is solidly built, I just wish that the packing on the filters was better.  40 filters come in a package that is about 3"x4"x5".  I got 4 extra packages so they take up considerable space in the drawer.  I know, petty, but first, I don't like putting things away. Two, if I have to put it away, it had better be easy to do so.<br /><br />If your coffee doesn't come in pods and you have a pod machine...just order it now and stop guessing if other methods are better

I'm not restricted to whatever pods or tea bags the grocery store has on it's shelves, and it allows me to brew the freshest cup possible. It's as simple as: turn on the machine, place an empty filter pod on the bottom half of the machine, fill with the right amount of coffee grounds or loose leaf tea, bend over the flap and lower the top half of the machine for 3 to 5 seconds. There is your one cup coffee pod or tea bag. I've given the perfect pod maker as gifts to my coffee and tea loving friends and they love it.

My wife make a batch of these for entire month at a time. Also, you can add extra coffee in the pods so you can avoid the double pod usage. Takes a bit of pratice to figure out the right about of coffee for the double sized pod, but once you figure it out, no more double pods. You have to make  sure you have enough pod filters, but thats to be expected, since you can not exactly buy these at you local store. But well worth the it. We have a Senseo machine and have had NO problems with using these.

review/text: As a retired Marine I love my coffee! We bought pods from the grocery stores but had to settle for what was available. When I saw the Perfect Pod Maker on Amazon I thought I have got to try this. I did about a year ago and am still making my own pods. The best thing I like about it is that you can make the pods as strong or as weak as you like and with whatever coffee flavor/brand you like. The Perfect Pod maker works great. I can normally make 12 pods in the amount of time it takes one cup to brew. It's easy to use and I leave it right on the counter. Great investment.

I contacted the seller As-Seen-on-TV.ws and told them that the product was defective. I was told, they would ship a newer revised unit, once they became available. However, when this one came, it was still the old style, I had the same experience as with the first one - it did not work! After contacting the company again, I was asked to return both units at my expense and they would send the newer style that was now available.<br />Now, I have been told that they will not send another product since shipping to Canada would be to costly, but instead refund my original purchase price without compensating my expense of returning two defective products. So how do I rate this products? I can't, it never worked to begin with. How do I rate the Seller? You draw your own conclusion.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I received a Keurig Mini Plus for christmas but found the k-cups too strong for my taste... after much research I ordered the Perfect Pod Holster, Perfect Pod Maker and Perfect Pod filters. Now I can make my own coffee pods at the strength I like. It took about 3 cups of coffee to get figure out the right amount of coffee and water to use but it was well worth it.  Easy to use and it makes a great cup of coffee.  One thing... thanks to the reviewer that wrote about the needle on the Keurig Mini Plus being a little off center.. the hole in the top of the holster needs to be a tad bit wider... use a pair of scissors.

review/summary: Very Easy To Use
review/text: I didn't buy Perfect Pod to save money.  I bought it so I could use my favorite brands of coffee with my pod coffee maker.  Perfect Pod allows me to do that and it is very easy to use.  I prefer it to a permanent filter basket because there's no mess to clean up after each cup of coffee.  The only thing that would make Perfect Pod better is if they included a coffee scoop sized just for the pods it makes.

review/summary: COULD HAVE BEEN 5 STAR
review/text: I've used the perfect Pod Maker for a couple of years and found that it saved me a lot of money over buying premade pods. You have to find out how much coffee to put in the pod by trial and error; not a major issue. However, my Pod Maker went belly up this morning. While I am ordering another to replece it, it seems to me that this is a relatively simple electronic gadget and should last for many years. I would have give it 5 stars except for that fact

review/text: This product is fantastic.  I had been having a hard time finding pods for the Home Cafe coffee maker.  My husband loves his coffee and we didn't want to get a new maker.  This has been great.  Now he can buy whatever coffee he wants and make his own and I don't have to search the internet and stores just to find pods that work.  I am very happy with this.

review/summary: Brach's Candy Corn has Changed for the Worst
review/text: People need to know that Brach's isn't the same good product anymore. Not only is the candy corn shaped differently with the colors mottled throughout the corn, the taste is flat and chalky. There is no longer the honey flavor nor the mellowcreme texture. I used to love candy corn for its low fat and satisfying sweet. The pumpkins are flat and tasteless too. I contacted Brach's and received no response of concern. The jelly beans are tasteless too, so gone is another brand that once was fun and happy and delicious.  Am I the only one who has noticed the loss of quality?

review/text: I ordered these after looking for the Sunshine biscuits that are sadly no longer made. I have to say I remember the American version was better (perhaps sweeter) but these seem to be a hit with everyone in my office. The package arrived and three packs quickly disappeared before I could hide them. If you like Raisin (currants) Biscuits this seems to be your only choice. Given the price and the fact that they are pretty good I will probably order again. One word of warning; it is hard to stop eating them once you start.

review/summary: Almost as good as the old Sunshine raisin biscuits
review/text: These are wonderful biscuits. My family's only disappointment is that they're too crispy compared to the raisin biscuits Sunshine sold until a few years ago and not as substantial. We've been able to solve the crispiness problem by putting a few biscuits and a small chunk of bread in a small, covered container; after a few hours, they're softened just a bit and are super yummy. Just wish they were a little more substantial.

And I agree using currants instead of raisins is just fine.  Actually, though, I wish this company would make a version using golden raisins, which are sweeter and softer than the usual variety.

Well they don't quite make it; not that they're bad, they are more "graham-crackery" in consistency with that sort of crunch as opposed to the cookie taste the old ones had; they're also thinner with half as much raisin filling. So the search goes on, sorry Dad, these will have to do for now.<br /><br />...Keebler- Are you listening?<br /><br />signed;<br />A big fan<br /><br />P.S. the case of 12 is a better deal, but unfortunate that you'll have more than you need (when they don't taste the same).

review/summary: Garibaldi Raisin (Currant) Biscuits
review/text: The "old" Sunshine raisin biscuits were always my favorite cookie (other than some of those made by my Mom or, later years, my wife) but they just disappeared from the shelves.  I was delighted to discover these Garibaldis and they are just like I remember the Sunshines.  They are excellent!!!  And while pricy, I'll be buying them again.  As noted above, it is nearly impossible to eat just one.

review/summary: Garibaldi Biscuits another name for Golden Fruit Bars
review/text: I have not seen these raisin (currant) biscuits in a very long time but I remember how much I used to love them.  The ones I remember were made by Sunshine Bakery, I believe; they may have been bought out by the Elves at Keebler at one time though.  The Garibaldi Biscuits are great tasting and basically look like the Golden Fruit bars that I remember as a kid but with a little less shiny golden surface texture. I bought a case of these and have enjoyed them each night with a glass of milk before bedtime.  Unfortunately the package is on the small side and there are only two "sheets" of biscuits but heck you are buying something that has been made of Unobtanium (Ub) for many years! Enjoy

review/text: They are not like the ones from the Sunshine Co. They are too dry, too thin, don't have a glossy top and dont taste the same. In short, they fall short of the real thing. Fit @ Active Wildberry Fruit Crisps from Aldis is as close as I can find but still not as good a the original. Can't the original ones be made again?

It now has a scant amount of current paste througout the cookie. Now there is no layers just 1 layer with a bit of current paste here and there, leaving this product almost tasteleess.

review/text: I had these biscuits as a child then no one carried them for a long time. I was thrilled to find them again.They are great for a quick pickmeup when hunger starts and a meal is a few hours away. They are great dunked in milk and tea.  However, most of my family,mainly the younger members, do not like these as they are a little dry.

This is her favorite treat we have given her. We break them up and put them in her Kong toy and she is occupied for a really long time. The other Loving Pets varieties we have tried she also loves, but she loved these even more. Highly recommend!

review/text: My dog did not like this. She began to cough and wheeze when I began to give them to her each time so after a few times I realized it was the treat. I threw them away. This may just be my dogs reaction but honestly had I read that on a review I'd not have bought them. I am not saying they are horrible, they may work for you but as for me they did not at all. I think I'd play it safe and buy a different kind.

review/text: This is excellent green tea and I am grateful I could find it on Amazon as none of the grocery stores around here carry it, nor does Walmart. It make a superior iced green tea for those of us that prefer green tea. It also work well hot. Luzianne has another winner of a product in this one and Amazon's price for a whole case of family size tea bags beats what I would have to spend at a grocery store anyway.  Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Makes weak tea with little taste, compared to standard tea...
review/text: Luzianne Green Tea, Family Size, 24-Count Tea Bags<br /><br />Google on "green tea benefits" for articles on using this product for health reasons.<br /><br />I've been drinking regular [dark] tea for about 50 years now.  To make a gallon of iced tea, I nearly fill a quart pot with filtered water, add three family-sized tea bags, boil, let cool; then add it to 3/4 gallon of water through a tea strainer.  Using Luzianne's standard tea, the concentrated tea is so dark, you can't see the bottom of the pot.  This formula makes excellent iced tea.<br /><br />Using the same formula with this green tea, the result is a seriously weak tea.  We even covered the hot pot and let it sit overnight so it would darken more; but, the pot's bottom was still clearly visible through the brewed concentrated tea.  After mixing with 3/4 gallon of water, the resulting tea was very light, and had little taste.<br /><br />These bags are 6 grams per tea bag, versus 7 grams for Luzianne's [dark] tea.  See customer images for a photo of family sized green tea on a box of family sized standard dark tea.<br /><br />After some experimentation, my iced tea formula is now a 50/50 ratio of family-sized bags: i.e., two bags of standard dark tea and two bags of green tea per gallon of tea.  This mix actually tastes better than just dark tea and far better than just green tea.  It has just a hint of green tea flavor.  Even though our tea costs more using this approach, it's still cheap, it tastes better, and should also provide the health benefits of green tea.<br /><br />The 3 stars are because, using only the Green Tea, resulting drink is too weak.

review/summary: Getting hard to find this stuff
review/text: It seems like every time I find a really good product, the manufacturer stops making it. (The garbage products keep getting made year after year).  This product is no longer available at any of the stores around me.<br /><br />Luzianne makes great green tea.  It is, of course, not as strong as black tea. The taste is smooth.  The caffeine level is not too bad.  I like making sun tea with the larger bags. 4 bags to the gallon and 4 hours of sunshine makes fantastic tea.  If you want it stronger just squeeze excess liquids from the bags when removing.<br /><br />I just hope Amazon keeps selling this stuff in bulk.  The price ($25/case) is very good.  This is the only food product I have ever bought online.

I find buying buy the case on Amazon is less expensive also.

review/summary: Fine for casseroles
review/text: Artichokes can sometimes be pricey at the store.  Sometimes on Amazon you can get deals, and I bought these when a sale was going on.  I use this in a recipe as follows:  1 cup parmesan, 1 cup mayo, 1 can artichokes, 2 pounds chicken breast.  Mix ingredients and cover the chicken, roast for 30-40 minutes at 375 degrees.  A crowd-pleasing, low-carb, but rich dish.  When there is not a sale, and often at the store here in Chicago, 1 can of artichokes is almost 4 dollars. The recipe above is such a favorite, getting 12 cans on sale was worth it, as they can last a few years.

You don't know until you bite into it.<br /><br />We were paying over $4 per can or $6 per pound on the Mediterranean food bar at the grocery store for these hearts and were very pleased with the product and the price from Amazon.<br /><br />One thing that pleased me about this brand is that they taste less salty than some other brands I've tried, so you get to taste more of the vegetable and less of the brine.<br /><br />These are not the marinated variety, just brine-soaked.
