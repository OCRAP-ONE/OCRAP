review/summary: No one liked it...
review/text: I really wanted to like this coconut water, but I couldn't take more than 3 sips. It is terrible. The flavor was flat, with an acidic aftertaste (that almost reminded me of tomato juice). I had my spouse and several friends take bottles to try and no one liked it. Maybe I got a bad batch? I don't know, but I won't be buying more to find out.

review/summary: Excellent coconut water
review/text: O.N.E. is the best coconut water I can get, other than getting it straight from a young coconut. For me it is the best thirst quencher there is (probably because of all the potassium in it) and Amazon has made it very easy, and cheaper than a regular store, to order it in large quantities, so I am now happy to report that O.N.E. has almost completely replaced regular drinking water in my life. I have had coconut water straight from the coconut in Costa Rica and I have also tried the two other big brands in the US (Zico, Vita Coco) and O.N.E. tastes best and most "natural" to me.

review/summary: As good as you'll get if it's not fresh from the coconut
review/text: I'm a big fan of coconut water, and typically buy a coconut every week or two as a treat for myself.  But it's a bit of a pain in the backside.  O.N.E. coconut water tastes almost as good as from a fresh coconut, but without the hassle and is a bit cheaper.  I always have one in my fridge to drink after a workout and it is great.  Some people have commented that it tastes like stale sugar water, I'm not sure about that.  To me it tastes like coconut water, so maybe to them coconut water tastes like stale sugar water.<br />Anywho if you do like coconut water, I will bet you'll enjoy O.N.E.

review/text: O.N.E. Coconut Water is an excellent post-exercise drink.  Immediately after exercise, the body is craving sugars. O.N.E. Coconut Water provides that natural sugar boost as well as five other electrolytes.  Coconut water has more potassium than a banana.  Again, another great reason to try O.N.E. Coconut Water.  It's very low in calories and has a light taste.  I like it so much that I am on Amazon's scheduled delivery program for this product.  It's so good that sometimes (twice) I have had to move up the delivery date to receive it sooner.  It's better than Gatorade (5 electrolytes) and bananas (less calories).

review/summary: O.N.E IS FIVE STARS!!!
review/text: There's nothing in the list of ingredients that you can't figure out: 100% natural coconut water (makes sense it's title translating to "One Natural Experience"). Thing is, it tastes like it. Offering it up to some of the local wahines here -surfer girls who grew up drinking the real thing- they all agreed ("yum!") it tastes just like the fresh juice.<br /><br />We can thank the great advancements in the production process over the past decade. Previous to that, minimal options included the old Thailand canned version (high-temp pasteurization, lost nutritional qualities, lotsa preservatives and a weird flavor), or even the first versions of cold-processed microfiltration (still not perfected, with added ingredients like sucrose).<br /><br />Most important thing is that the O.N.E. not only just taste great, but it has the qualities that make coconut water so healthy, hydrating, and beneficial to the body.<br /><br />FIVE STARS!!!

I'm sure there are more, but those are the ones that come to mind.<br /><br />I saw ONE's Coconut Water at the Specialty Food Show and it looked interesting. The nice people at the booth explained to us about coconut water and a�ai and we were surprised and delighted.<br /><br />I finally got to try ONE's Coconut Water and it's a hit. I found it to be light and refreshing and more of a water that a milk. Coconut water is made from baby green coconuts unlike coconut milk. As a result the flavor is subtle and not overpowering.<br /><br />I enjoyed the drink, but I especially liked the benefits. With 670mg of potassium, hardly any carbs and only 60 calories, this thirst quenching drink's a must. It comes packed in tetra pak and it's recyclable too.<br /><br />one natural experience<br /><br />ONE also promotes a healthy lifestyle. It contains electrolytes, regulates the functioning of the intestine, helps hydrate the skin, and keeps the body cool.<br /><br />ONE also has an A�ai drink which I'm going to review in the future.

review/summary: My favorite is O.N.E!!
review/text: O.N.E. Coconut water is the liquid found inside young coconuts, not to be confused with coconut milk. Coconut water is found in the core of young, green coconuts. As the coconut matures this liquid largely becomes absorbed into the nut's flesh. Coconut water has long been a popular drink in the tropics, especially in Brazil, Tropical Asia and Trinidad and Tobago, where it is available fresh or bottled. It is naturally fat-free and low in food energy (16.7 calories or 70 kilojoules per 100 grams).<br /><br />Coconuts for drinking are carefully packaged and sold in many places.  In Central America, particularly in Costa Rica, it is found and sold in strategic highway stops or on the beaches; there, the coconut water is called "agua de pipa", and the coconut is cut in front of the customer to ensure its freshness. O.N.E. Coconut water is a natural sports drink because of its high potassium and mineral content which helps the body recover from rigorous exercise.<br /><br />I LOVE THIS O.N.E. Coconut Water!!

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect with this product. I can't disagree with the name. It is mostly water with just a hint of a coconut flavor. It is not sweet like a juice. It is not like coconut milk.<br />What was surprizing, is the amount of carbohrdrates (according to the package label). Not as much as a sugar sweetened soft drink or a juice, but much higher than water or a diet beverage.

I only gave it three gulps before realizing this is not for you.  But for those that can get past the taste, it is like drinking water but getting more potassium than a banana.  And for you environmentalist, the package is recyclable.

review/summary: I don't know how to describe this...
review/text: But, I will do the best I can.<br /><br />In all honesty, I didn't expect too much from this, but again, I've never tasted coconut milk or coconut "water" as it were.  I've never even tasted natural coconut.  So I go into this review in complete ignorance of what to expect.<br /><br />First negative: The sampler I received was already a day past the "best before" date.  Way to go Amazon!  (yes, I know, it's still 'good' for a few days after, but I'm a real stickler for freshness...especially for something I've never had before.)<br /><br />Second negative: The taste.  It's not bad...it's just not good.  If I had to describe it...you know how bananas taste, right?  You know the texture of the banana, especially those little slivers that come off the skin, is a little powdery after you've eaten for a while?  Take that texture, remove the banana flavor, mix it in water, and you've got this.  Or extremely watered down milk.  I just can't see this really refreshing anyone, because there's no "kick" to it.<br /><br />So what's good about it?  Well, it's natural.  I give it kudos for that, because there are a lot of non-natural beverages out in the world making us sick.<br /><br />"That's it????"  I mean, what more can I really say about it?  The taste is horrendous, I wasn't refreshed after drinking it, I can't imagine buying this in the store, etc etc.  Sorry I can't put more words to this review, but the above summarizes my reaction as best I can.

review/summary: CocoNOT for everyone
review/text: I tried O.N.E. Coconut Water, and my opinion is mixed. There's no denying that it's healthy, fat-free, gluten-free and all-natural... but unless you already know you like coconut water/milk, this might not be the thing for you. Having tried coconut milk before, I knew what to expect. It had a slightly foul smell, and the taste is different from anything else. Coconut water is an acquired taste.<br /><br />When my sister tried it, she spit it out in the sink. When my dad tried it, he said, "it's just water." (It's true--it's very faintly flavored). I didn't think it was the world's greatest drink, but my opinion wasn't quite so negative as that.<br /><br />While not delicious, I will say that the product IS healthy, and its taste is not overbearing. The container was a bit difficult to open as well. All in all, however, it was what I expected. Nothing more, nothing less.

review/summary: WATER? MAYBE - COCONUT, BARELY A HINT
review/text: I've been drinking canned coconut water for years and there is considerable variation in the quality available out there. This stuff is, without a doubt, the most insipid, bland, flavorless product to ever come out of a beverage container. Even the cheapest coconut water available in a metal can has more flavor and character than O.N.E. What's even more disappointing is that compared to fresh coconut water it tastes like its' been diluted with about 4 parts water to ONE part coconut. They must harvest the coconuts as soon as they have any juice in them. Even adding sugar was no help. I cannot believe that there are any positive reviews based on the product that I received and can only guess that quality control is non-existant. Those who posted positive reviews MUST have gotten a better batch. I had a bad experience with O.N.E. Acai juice also. It was revolting (but, at least it wasn't bland). Please read my ONE star rating of that rot before you decide to buy any. No more O.N.E. products for me, EVER.

review/text: Another reviewer mentioned how his VitaCoco didn't measure up to O.N.E. Ironically, for me, it was the exact opposite! I have tasted O.N.E. from another source and it was good, but my autoship from Amazon seemed 'off.'  I am on autoship w/Amazon for both O.N.E. and VitaCoco. The flavor of VitaCoco seems much better to me. The "use by" dates of both shipments were fine, but O.N.E.'s taste just didn't do it for me; yet, I've tasted O.N.E. from other sources beforehand and liked it, so perhaps these coconut waters can differ from batch to batch?  If my next auto shipment of O.N.E. leaves me flat again, I will definitely cancel it and keep just the VitaCoco.  In short, I suppose with these conflicting reviews--mine and others'--there may be no choice but to try it yourself to experience it and discover your own personal preferences.

review/summary: ONE Coconut Water
review/text: Has fabulous health benefits but if you are used to sweet coconut waters the taste is not what you expect because this is 100% coconut water (the real deal. If you have ever had Goya or El Mexicano Coconut Waters, they are only 70% coconut water and 30% sugar and junk and the calorie content is around 180.  ONE Coconut water calorie content is only 60, no fat and it does not leave any aftertaste, just refreshing.  I personally shake a pack of Splenda into it.  I like the variety with the splash of Pineapple, Passion Fruit or Guava too and their calorie content is not that high either and I don't put splenda in them as they are naturally sweetened.  I will NOT buy VITA Brand Coconut Water because I found it it has Celebrity Investors and that right there just taints it.  (Madonna and a few others have a stake in Vita) I wrote to ONE on their website and asked about coupons and they arrived in my mailbox about 7 days later! They were $.50 off and I got my Coconut water for $.99.  Nice surprise and this type of customer service will keep me coming back to this brand.

review/summary: Not bad, but no substitute for fruit juices
review/text: When I was a kid, I would occasionally buy a coconut and drill a couple of holes in it so that I could drain out the "milk". It was hard to do it without getting a few woody chips in the liquid, but I'd usually wind up with half a glass of cloudy liquid. The first mouthful was OK - a reminder of the exotic unfamiliarity of the taste, coupled with a sense of accomplishment - but by the second or third sip I'd realize that I actually didn't like it very much. It was OK for cooking (Thai curries, for example), but not for swigging.<br /><br />The O.N.E. product is much more palatable: lighter, fresher, not so cloying. I'd be interested in seeing how I could use it in cocktails: it might work rather well. Having said that, however, I don't think I'd buy it simply to drink "as is"; it simply doesn't have the zing of a good fruit juice.

review/summary: Will Never Order Again
review/text: Before I give my review, I have to admit that I normally don't pay a lot of attention to 1 star reviews because I find that the person is usually angry about the item. I'm not angry, but I do regret my purchase.<br /><br />I ordered a case of these drinks during the holiday lightening deals a few weeks ago. I also had my husband order a case as one of the family gifts for my sisters and parents. We already opened our case, and it was the most vile drink I have ever tasted. It seemed spoiled, and I really couldn't even tell that it was supposed to taste like coconut water. When my son got home from school, he wanted to try one. I told him they weren't good, but he insisted. He took a drink and said it was okay, but I could tell that he didn't want to admit it wasn't good. He took a few more sips, and then said he didn't want it anymore. I'm so glad that I tasted one first because I had planned on putting them in his lunch bag. Now we're stuck with a case of these nasty things that I don't even want to give away to anyone.

review/text: I love O.N.E. the most of all Coconut Water. What got me really upset was that Amazon sent me a shipment on March 2011 that had a sell date of May 2011 and got recalled on April 2011. The recall was on all shipments with a sell date of "May XX, 2011". Ugh. By April I have already consumed the entire March shipment. Well, I am still alive so my body either killed any potential molding or molding has yet started inside the Coconut water packaging. I emailed Amazon. Ignored. Well, cancelled subscription to all O.N.E. coconut water

review/text: So I've tried all the major brands out there - even used to have the Subscribe and Save to Zico for the past year. I've been on the ONE Subscribe and Save for the past 3 months and I must say, I'm extremely thrilled.<br /><br />Tastes great - fresh young coconut water taste. Highly hydrating product, even great when recovering from illness.<br /><br />--- Slightly gross story so avoid if you want ---<br />I recently had a sinus infection and the high amount of potassium helps with thining out your mucus so you don't have as much pressure in your head. Worked like a charm and sure beats eating 2-3 bananas a day and it helps keep my hydrated!<br />--- end story ---<br /><br />Keep in mind I work for a large food & beverage company and I can tell you this sure beats any product we make!<br /><br />Overall, I love this product, wish they still had the 50% offer, it was a STEAL! I will continue to keep this as a S&S product for my household.

I like coconut, but not particularly fond of the clear "water".  But it does taste quite refreshing on a hot day.  It does bring up fond memories of my life in Hawaii.<br />Nutritionally speaking, it is high in potassium, so it could be used as a sport drink.  Also it only has 60 calories, no fat, and is 11 ounces.

review/summary: Refreshing, but not nearly as good as fresh
review/text: I've tried coconut juice from various companies, and this particular specimen ranks slightly higher than average in flavor.  Sweet, but not cloyingly so.  And, of course I shouldn't forget to offer props to these folks for "keeping it real" so to speak... letting the coconut juice stand on its own -- thankfully no additives, preservatives, etc.<br /><br />But still, despite the pleasant convenience of the package and the decent taste, it just didn't compare to the real thing:  a coconut with a straw stuck in it... either in flavor, or (likely) in health benefits.<br /><br />With that said, however, I think it'd be a fine (and enjoyable) idea to stock a bunch of coconut juice packs from this company for throwing into your gym bag, because this drink is hugely more healthy (and I believe, far more tasty) than any sports drink.  And who could possibly lug and deal with fresh coconuts at the gym, eh? ;)

review/summary: Tastes like water
review/text: So, I kind of grew up on coconuts... having been born on a beach town.  I also grew up Coconut milk, so I was pretty excited about this product.  However, after drinking it... it doesn't meet any of my expectations. It doesn't taste like Coconut  and simply tastes really watered down.  In fact, it tastes like you're just drinking water... very plain.  It wasn't very sweet or flavorful. I may be a little harsh because Coconuts are near and dear to my heart, but I have to be honest and I think they could have done much better.  For those of you who love coconut milk, I would recommend buying young coconuts from your local Asian supermarket. You can open it up, drink fresh milk and even eat some fresh coconut meat.  Nothing beats that experience... the real deal. Plus, it's better for the environment... no plastic containers or trash to worry about. Plus, it tastes so much better than this product.

review/summary: some general comments on coconut water
review/text: I have Not tried this coconut water yet, but I plan to try it. Therefore many of you will think I should not be posting here. I'm putting 3 * bec. apparently I can't post this unless I rate it, but that's not an actual rating.  However, in light of all the comments regarding Jon's post, I thought I'd share some things I read on the Internet re coconut water & coconuts. I suspect there might be some people who are interested. Pasteurization kills a lot of the beneficial ingredients in coconut water, but it's an FDA requirement that All coconut water be pasteurized (possibly the brand that's sold in a crystalized form doesn't need to be pasteurized (I don't know).  I read on several sites that coconuts shipped to this country are preserved in formaldehyde, so maybe it's actually better to drink the coconut water that's packaged from coconuts in their native country, than to drink it from the coconut itself which has been shipped here. Of course drinking it from the coconut itself when you're lucky enough to be in a tropical country would be best. I read that many of the plantations add sugar to the soil to make the coconut water sweet.  No idea if that's actually bad.

review/text: Three HEALTHY Stars!! O.N.E. 100% Coconut Water is one of the most natural drinks available. And it is fat free and sugar free with electrolytes. In addition, it has 60 Calories per package, 15 carbohydrates and packs a potassium punch of 670 mg. There are 14 natural sugars and nothing is added in an attempt to boost the flavor or change it.  It is as Nature intended and it is placed in an attractive soft carton with a foil pull-tab opener. It has a pleasant flavor with a hint of coconut taste to it and it should be served cold and consumed completely after opening the package. Definitely recommended as an alternative to those 'health drinks' with refined sugar. Three NATURAL Stars!!

review/summary: What do you expect? May be natural but not sweet.
review/text: I was expecting a full flavor of coconut as I'm used to from other products. It states that it's natural, and I believe them it is natural. However, for someone like me, who likes sweet tasting flavors, it's definitely not a favorite drink. Like me, if you are expecting something sweet tasting with a certain amount of sugar, think twice. It doesn't have a distinct coconut flavor either. Very little, and slight flavor of coconut, almost doesn't exist. Expect something like water, no color. Regular flavored waters you find in supermarkets have a more distinct flavor, but this one doesn't. They are sitting in my fridge and I don't wanna drink them, I have a very good appetite and I'm not a picky person, but I don't want to drink that thing at all. It might be an healthy choice when you play sports and dehydrated. If you are expecting a delightful flavor of coconut, then find something else. Personally, I wouldn't suggest such an expensive drink for just dehydrating.

The next day, I took my cold coconut water out of the fridge and took a sip...UG...it tasted really really off. I dumped it down the drain and to my surprize and disbelief, it look like a small animal liver was stuffed in the box. I'm very serious when I tell you this! I took pictures and my father-in-law was actually there when this 'thing' drop out of the box.<br /><br />Got a call back from O.N.E when the saw the pix I sent them.  They asked me if I wanted more coconut water and I said NO. They said this has never happened before.  I still feel sick to my stomach after what I saw.<br /><br />I'm going to dump the rest of the water in my garden as I just can't bring myself to drink the water!

review/text: ... as such, it tastes like pure coconut water and that's precisely what many of us have been chasing after for quite some time. Not "Coconut Flavored Juice" or "Processed Coconut Drink" or "Reconstituted Coconut Liquid Concentrate". Straight up, unadulterated, water out of a baby Coconut that goes from the plant to the container without any industrial interference in between. That's what this is- and it wins.<br /><br />It seems as if some of the lower reviews are upset because this isn't a processed beverage. Yeah. Duh. That's why it's kind of expensive and that's exactly why people buy it. This is an all natural product. If you want intensely sweetened "fruit drinks", stick to V8 Splash or Kool Aid.<br /><br />My only suggestion to those of us in the "Been Looking For Pure Coconut Water Forever" group is to pace yourself when your O.N.E. finally arrives. I burnt myself out very quickly, drinking a couple per day. Now, I drink one every couple days and savor each one more.<br /><br />If you want a "Coconut Flavored Drink", look elsewhere. If you want pure, natural Coconut water, here it is.

The large amount of sugar one would have to consume by eating bananas or potatoes to get the same amount of potassium, well I just can't do it.<br />This drink also reminds me of Hawaii. This is a very popular drink in the Islands and I guess the reason is self-explanatory.

review/summary: As close to drinking it fresh on the beach as you can get!!!!
review/text: The O.N.E. folks have really done an excellent job in capturing the flavor of fresh coconut water and transporting it up north without using any preservatives: just a sterile container.<br />Coconut water has lots of healthful properties. It has a particular place in my heart because when I had a horrible tropical flu in Brazil, and couldn't even keep H2O in my tummy, I could still drink coconut water (from the coconut vendor at the corner, that time). It kept me going for 3 days. So if your kids have the tummy bug, (or if you had one too many the night before)this can help.<br />FYI, forget the lime part from the song. Bad idea.

review/summary: Delicious and Nutritious
review/text: If you're a fan of coconut flavor - like coconut sorbet, you'll love this stuff. It must be served cold - stick it in the fridge. Also shake it before drinking. But it is the most refreshing, delicious drink I have ever tasted. It's sweet and crisp. I drink it during workouts because it boosts electrolytes. It's only 60 calories per 11oz container and even has one gram of protein. And best of all it's a natural product - no added sugar or any of that. I'm a fan but you may want to try one before you buy a whole case to make sure you like it as much as I do.

review/summary: A great alternative for the calorie conscious!
review/text: I have always been calorie-conscious and drank diet soda on a regular basis.  After a study in Purdue noted that rats gained more weight with artificial sweeteners than natural sugar (article cited below) I began to rethink the diet soda plan.  Coconut water is a great alternative to regular soda and juice... O.N.E. has only 60 calories compared to at least twice that with soda/juice -- plus, no artificial sweeteners.  It's definitely not as sweet but you get used to it... now, regular soda tastes too sweet to me.<br /><br />I have had numerous canned coconut water beverages purchased in Asian food stores.  They were all processed with added sweeteners and preservatives with a very obvious unnatural taste.  O.N.E., however tastes great!  Very close to the coconuts that I've had in India and the Caribbean islands.  I do like Coco Vita better (also available here on Amazon) as it has less of an aftertaste.  I've found both taste best when they are cool but not cold... I let them sit outside the refrigerator for about 15 minutes before I start drinking.<br /><br />"A Role for Sweet Taste: Calorie Predictive Relations in Energy Regulation by Rats," Susan E.

review/summary: Includes Handy Straws!  Great for Kids!
review/text: If I could give this product more than 5 stars, I would!  Our family has tried VitaCoco and Zico Coconut Water (both were good) but O.N.E. Coconut water is our favorite because it includes little extendable straws that can be used like a juice box.  The handy straw allows you to neatly poke a hole through the foil seal for a no-spill drink...perfect for car rides or letting kids carry their drink around the house.  We also drink coconut water when we are ill, instead of Pedialyte or Gatorade (much more healthy).  The straw is a great way to get fussy toddlers to drink the fluids they need when they're sick.<br /><br />I highly recommend coconut water.  The consistency can take some getting used to because it's thicker than water or juice, but the nutritional value can't be beat.  It is the perfect drink for kids and athletes: an all natural, whole food....slightly sweet with fewer natural sugars than most fruit juices, no artificial colors or flavors, won't stain, packed with potassium and electrolytes, and it actually contains calcium and a little protein!  Packaged in small, recyclable Tetra Pak containers (eco-friendly) that contain no PBA like some plastics.  You can easily take this coconut water with you anywhere- I always keep a couple in the car and often stick one in my purse (although coconut water tastes best cold).  If you have any reservations about trying this product, just go for it!  If you really don't like it, you can always sell the rest on craigslist :)

review/summary: Read the Expiration Dates.....
review/text: I just bought 24 packs of ONE Coconut water (11.2 oz)because of a great buy @ $1.10/ea.  However, I must say they ALL had a sour after taste. I was really surprised. I've tasted most, if not all, of the major brands and this was the worst. They were probably sitting in a hot sweaty warehouse and management needed to move the product, thus the great sale price!<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars for the great buy and the fact I didn't get sick.  After reading the freshness dates of the 2 cases, I noticed it was set to expire in 2 months from the day I recieved it. I'm gonna chaulk this up as an old batch. I will taste this brand again with at least 6 months left on the expire date and see if it makes a difference. I will update my review then.

review/summary: Tastes like the real thing
review/text: Being originally from a latin-american country, coconut water is one of those essential summer week-end drinks that we not only enjoyed as refreshments, but loved for all the no nonsense nutritional information our parents would throw at us about it.<br /><br />And though it's been a while since I've had a real hard shelled coconut spliced open to insert a straw and enjoy, this little pack did its job of refreshing me with that wonderful taste, and make me feel proud of the nutrition I was getting out of it.<br /><br />Packaged in a handy little container, it keeps the product fresh and with all its flavorful attributes.  Delicious, refreshing, nutritious.  It's definitely worth a try, and you long for the real thing but are far from a tropical beach, this might be your best substitute.

review/summary: Refreshing!
review/text: Not being a medical or nutritional expert, I can't comment on the health benefits of coconut water. The product's claimed benefits seem reasonable and commendable.<br /><br />It seems that there's a real craze these days for juice-type beverages, and although the benefits of increased intake of fruits and vegetables are well-known, the price for these "high-end" beverages is typically $3.50 to $5.00 for a single serving, and often contains 300 calories or more. Comparatively speaking, O.N.E. Coconut Water is a low-calorie bargain.<br /><br />I've never had coconut water before, so I didn't know exactly what to expect. To my suprise, O.N.E. Coconut Water is quite clear, almost like water. An 11-oz serving contains only 60 calories, so as expected there is just a hint of sweetness. The coconut taste is also very light. There is no bitterness, no strange aftertaste. It's a truly refreshing beverage, and a pleasant surprise!

review/summary: The Glories Of Delicious Pristine Coconut Water
review/text: I love coconut water because it brings back memories of when I was a little kid and my grandmother in Miami would cut a coconut in half and let me sip the amazing water, which is often slightly surgary/salty. The problem: most canned coconut waters are nothing like it. Now there IS a coconut water. O.N.E.'s 11 ounce coconut waters is NUMBER ONE. It's not just refreshing, but it's exactly like the original coconut water I remembered with the wonderful taste, smoothness and ability to quench your thirst. Also, it's totally natural, with five electrolytes and more potassium than a banana!

review/summary: Closest thing to Fresh Coconut Water!!!
review/text: We come from a tropical country where coconuts are in abundance. We have grown up drinking fresh coconut water knowing fully well its health benefits over all those carbonated, artificially flavored drinks that contain a lot of bad than good.<br /><br />In the US, there is no way you are going to get fresh coconut water that is as tasty. So we shopped around quite a bit and tried out several different brands (from oriental stores, local farmer's market and Whole Foods) before settling down on O.N.E. Most brands (esp. those from the oriental stores) tasted down right awful and there were nothing like the natural coconut water. To make matters worse these had weird preservatives added in (which is a big NO NO). A handful few came close (that were found in Whole Foods), but taste wise O.N.E was definitely the best one.<br /><br />Ah..one more thing..always drink this chilled (tastes a lot better).<br /><br />Here are the reasons to like it...<br />- It's very close to the FRESH coconut water<br />- The tetra pack they use is BPA free and the packaging says its lightly pasteurized and there are no added chemicals<br /><br />Why its not rated 5 stars (YET)...<br />- We hope they will step up and make everything organic (to completely eliminate unwanted pesticides and fertilizers).<br />- Not much is known about how the coconuts are grown, where they are grown, how they are harvested etc.<br />- Its not certified "Fair Trade", so we do not know how the farmers are being paid. O.N.E says that their coconuts are from Brazil (so we hope the coconut farmers are paid their equal share).<br />- We hope they will make the product labeling a lot more clearer and provide more details on their pasteurizing process.

review/summary: Best of the Coconut Waters
review/text: First we tried all the coconut waters out there from Vita Coco to Zico to brands Amazon does not sell from our local health market....ONE is clearly the best....The other brands  had an array of  bad aftertastes, and some were not palatable, and a few we threw out after trying (I won't specifically attack a brand, let's just say I am not reviewing the other brands sold by Amazon...) Originally, I read the reviews of  the other products so we bought them all as we wanted to add this beverage into our diets, so we compared them all to figure out which brand we would buy regularly and we were extremely objective and based on Amazon reviews did not expect results we had...ONE had no aftertaste, easy to drink like water but with a good, but not overbearing, coconut taste that made the drink refreshing...our fridge has two liters of ONE on the shelf now...if you want to get the benefits of coconut water and have a high quality great tasting product, don't bother with the rest..ONE is clearly the best coconut water product on the market.

review/summary: Nice Compact Post Sports Drink
review/text: Coconut Water is a fantastic way to replenish your electrolytes and get hydrated. When I toured Thailand and Cambodia I got the water direct from large coconuts sold by the roadside. This is a lot easier to tote around. Coconut water is slightly sweet and lightly astringent, an acquired taste for some. I prefer the Amy and Brian cans better than the water in the O.N.E. (I also like getting little bits of coconut with my coconut water), but O.N.E. compares nicely to Zico or Harvest Bay.<br /><br />Amy and Brian sources their coconut water from Thai coconuts while O.N.E., Zico and Harvest Bay get theirs from South America. There is a real taste difference as the Thai coconuts are sweeter and less astringent.<br /><br />If you're looking for something to throw in you gym bag or backpack when working out this is a nice choice, if you're looking for all around refreshing drink I'd recommend seeking out Amy and Brain brand.

They should have some sort of quality control to  separate out spoiled coconuts. Often in my experience, 10% of coconuts will be spoiled and their water will make whole pile go bad. This may be the case here in bad samples. I have tried ONE from several vendors and my experience is never the same.

review/text: I've been a fan of ONE coconut water for a couple of months, drinking as much as I can because is so refreshing and I love the taste.<br />I did notice the weird smell from the carton, but it tastes normal to me... until I got SICK! My stomach bloated like if I was 8 months pregnant. Lots of pain and cramps! Today is my second day sick and I already call the company, they took my info, and I'm waiting for an answer. There's many issues with this water. Please BE CAREFUL! and if you are drinking ONE coconut water and not feeling very well, please report it!

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: As a brazilian woman, I was disappointed with this. I first bought this at Whole Foods, was delicious and refresh. I was happy to see this brand at amazon, but the taste is not the same, do not taste coconut water. I have strange taste like smoke flavor. Leaving too far from Brazil I am sad that I can not have my coconut water in the morning.

review/summary: Warning-all brands of coconut water have bad taste if exposed to heat
review/text: IMO- O.N.E. is the best tasting coconut water available outside of sticking a straw into a coconut. But the 2 boxes of 11.2 Oz O.N.E. (no additional flavors in them) I bought on Amazon taste awful. The expiration date is in 2012.<br />I believe the answer lies in temperature. The product I purchased from Amazon was shipped in the summer months and stored in perhaps a hot warehouse, definitely hot trucks, warhorses, etc.. on its way to me - August 2011 - a hot time of the year. I've had the same experience with all the other brands except Zico. This brand always has an awful aftertaste because it is made from concentrate - a process of heating.<br />I discovered this product last fall when the tens were cooler. Now I have 2 cases of useless coconut water. And I have a kidney disease in which I need a lot of potassium - coconut water helps me fight this - naturally.<br /><br />So, be careful where and when in the year you buy coconut water*.  Some retail stores do better, but not all the time. I had to return a lot of another brand of coconut water to a national organic and natural foods supermarket.<br />Same issue - same time of year - a serious aftertaste. If tastes fine to you, never mind. But otherwise, now you know about this issue - I've shared what I've learned by hard experience...<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UUWECC">O.N.E. Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Better than Zico, pretty much the same as Vita
review/text: Now I tried all three brands. It is refreshing. It is not too sweet. But it also has a little sour aftertaste. Definitely way better than Zico, which is a yuck. Between O.N.E. and Vita, hmmmm, almost the same, but maybe Vita wins a little bit.<br /><br />Afterall, none of these taste like real coconut water.

review/summary: WOW!
review/text: I have been cracking coconuts for years, but my wife and daughter can't do it when I am not around so I decided to try "The Nut" in a bottle. I was buying a different brand and thought it tasted nothing like the real thing, but was acceptable for smoothies. THEN, I TRIED O.N.E. It was offered to me on a hot day and it was as close to the real thing as could be. I highly recommend this over any of the competitors. Stay Hydrated my friends.

review/summary: Tastiest coconut water among Zico and Vita Coco
review/text: This is the tastiest coconut water I have tried so far. I have tried Zico, Vita Coco and ONE and I liked ONE the best. I don't know if it is the closet to the real coconut water taste because I haven't really tried real coconut water before but for those who didn't like the taste of Vita Coco or Zico, don't give up on coconut water just yet and give ONE a try. This is my favorite drink during and after cardio-workouts (running and tennis).

review/summary: Not Bad at All but
review/text: During my childhood till my teen years ,we had a fertile coconut tree within my family's property.It bears fruit all throughout the year.We had a long bamboo stick with a knife in the end to cut the fruit down ,use a machete to cut it open and drink the water and the young meat.I have left that house long time ago now .It has been years and the only time I get to drink and eat a fresh coconut is when I go to Hawaii.Even at the Asian stores that sells the suppose to be young coconut is a gamble.<br /><br />I have tried  coconut drink in a can before that were sold in Asian stores and everytime I drank it I almost threw up ,so I avoided those drinks but when I saw this product in a grocery store and said to myself to  give it a  try and so I tried  this 100% coconut. I first tried Naked Cpconut water, I found it really refreshing but expensive.So I tried this O.N.E. brand and actually got lucky.This one actually tasted better that Naked.Its pretty acceptable for my standard but not as good as the one from a real young coconut.I tried another brand VitaCoco but this one has a strong aftertaste that is not natural,that I have tasted in the canned coconut drinks. I dont like it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Ju;y 2011.The new O.N.E. that just got delivered has a different packaging and this one does not taste fresh or young. It tastes old.I got 2 boxes of these.It now taste as bad as the ZICO.The past boxes of ONE were pretty good but the one that got delivered for this month is not good at all.

review/summary: Sleeping Easy! Gets Rid of Leg Cramps For This Athlete
review/text: Lifting, jumping, training -it's all part of my conditioning. As an athlete I need more potassium that the average bear. And for the past two years I've had restless leg syndrome. I'd fall asleep, and JUST as I'm about to cross that threshold into that nice, deep, relaxing REM sleep, I WAKE UP with this powerful, annoying urge to stretch my quads.<br /><br />Even eating two banana's a day, stretching, warm shower, and two water bottles right before falling asleep I still got these insanely insatiable cramps. Well, I take one O.N.E before falling asleep and I sleep through the night. Don't pay GNC prices for Potassium pills, because 90mg won't even phase you. I've tried three of those GNC Potassium pills and didn't even feel a difference.<br /><br />O.N.E tastes good (even delicious after you've drank it for a while), is refreshing with it's smooth, sublte taste, and actually cured my restless leg syndrome. No joke, no lie. I don't know if this is the end-all cure for RLS, but it certainly cured my night cramps!

review/summary: Delicious and very refreshing
review/text: After hearing all the hype about coconut water, I was eager to try it out for myself.  I bought 2 different brands that I found at Whole Foods (one of those being this brand) to try out before I committed to a 12-pack purchase.  The other one I tried was okay but I absolutely loved the O.N.E. coconut water.  It tasted really fresh and I found that one was not enough.  I started craving it and immediately ordered the 12-pack from amazon and am now getting it delivered on a regular basis.  I am also ordering getting a subscription to this for my parents who really enjoy coconut water as well.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this, then I suggest getting an individual pack from the store to try it out first.  If you enjoy it, order it from here because with the subscribe and save discount.  This really is the best price I've found so far.<br /><br />I drink one of these daily after my workout and prefer it to Gatorade.  From what I've read, Gatorade is better for people who do heavy workouts since it contains more sodium but I prefer the taste of coconut water which actually has more electrolytes.<br /><br />Update 2/22/11<br />I just tried Zico coconut water and it is nowhere as delicious as O.N.E. coconut water.  The Zico tasted very bland and didn't have as much of the coconut flavor as this one has.  This one is definitely my favorite from the ones I tried.

review/summary: Refreshing, Not too sweet, Found at World Market too!
review/text: As a "first time Coconut Water drinker", O.N.E was definitely the right product to try.  Not too sweet, tastes exactly like the Coconut Water I drank out of a coconut in Mexico and very refreshing.  Best to drink cold, when the water is warm it has this strange after-taste.  It's only been a week, but I've noticed my "acne prone" skin has cleared up in the areas I break out the most.  I live in a very dry climate, and feel this water is definitely hydrating me more than average water.<br /><br />If you want to test it and don't want to order a 12 pack immediately, I found 1 liter containers at World Market (aka Cost Plus) for $4.49 in their grocery area.

review/summary: Love this coconut water!
review/text: I love this coconut water. I have tried a lot of different brands, on my quest to acquire a taste for the stuff (on my chiropractor's recommendation). This not only does need to be refrigerated until you want to drink it (definitely refrigerate ANY coconut water before drinking), but comes in several delicious flavors. It is not sweetened at all, and has a very light flavor with no haunting aftertaste. Previous to this brand I liked a brand that had to be kept frozen until you were ready to drink it, which took up too much space!! I actually signed up for Amazon's suscribe & save program on this product, which is not only convenient, but really does save you money!

review/summary: Doesn't taste like coconut water
review/text: This water has next to no taste in it. Straight up young coconuts have a superior taste and this doesn't come close really. Zico is much closer, I wouldn't order these again. I got them as part of the Amazon lightning deal--yuck. They are still good for me so I'll finish them.

review/text: As a frequent drinker of adult beverages, I highly recommend O.N.E. Coconut Water. Taste great with a straw and best served chilled. It's great for hangovers and a great mixer as well. You're doing good if you can get it under $2/per.<br /><br />Trader Joes currently sells the Zico for 17.88 a 12 pack.

review/summary: Tasty and light
review/text: It's light and refreshing.  I've tasted fresh coconut water right out from the coconut.  The Western coconuts like the ones from the Caribbean are a bit on the salty side but the sweet ones are from the tropical areas in the Far East like Indonesia.  So, comparing this to the Western coconut water, it's way better and much more refreshing.  Comparing this to the Indonesian coconut water, it's below par.  All in all, it's still pretty good.

review/summary: The best Coconut water I've found on Amazon
review/text: Why did Amazon stop stocking this? Now it is some other seller who is charging outrageous shipping. I am very disappointed. I accidently ordered the Vitacoco crap and it is totally nasty. O.N.E taste fresh like it's just off the coconut in comparison, Vitacoco taste like it has been kept in storage for a year and then soured beyond belief. AMAZON please start selling O.N.E instead! For pete's sake!

review/summary: Where Is The Straw???
review/text: I like this product very much.  It is very refreshing after mowing the lawn, but for the last few months there have been no straws glued to the side of the containers.  Is this the case with everyone else's orders?  It isn't very convenient to have to dig around the house for an extra straw.  Four stars for no straw.

review/text: I really enjoy coconut water. This and ZICO are my favorites and i have yet to try Vita Coco.<br />This O.N.E Coconut Water is really refreshing and it cools your body down. I drink alot of this all year but, mostly in the summertime.<br />It is kind of pricey, but it's worth it. Oh, it's good for you too with the added electrolytes.

review/summary: Tasty alternative to getting it directly from a coconut
review/text: On a trip to Panama, I became a fan of coconut water, having drank it from a ginormous coconut, freshly prepared.  I've been buying the canned version occasionally at the store and have been trying to decide which brand I like best.  So far I've tried the generic cheapo brand from the asian store, Amy & Brian's Coconut Water, Vita, and now ONE.  I think I like ONE the best.  It is definitely the lightest flavored of the bunch.  Some people have complained that it's TOO light and not coconutty enough.  I guess it's a matter of preference.  I also like the packaging best and think it's better than the canned variety.  The metal taste leeches into the water in the canned versions I think.  Anyhow, ONE's flavor is the closest to fresh tasting coconut water, mostly because of the packaging.  It's easy to keep and carry around.  I just ordered the regular flavor and also the smaller flavored variety as well.
