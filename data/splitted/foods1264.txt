review/summary: Loose stools from beginning to end
review/text: I am very fond of Wellness brand itself, but this particular kind just did not get along with my dog's digestive system. I purchased at Petco store. My dog is a Sheltie and she has not had special dietary need that I know of. She was fine with other formulas/treats from Wellness.

review/summary: My Dog Wouldn't Touch this with a Ten Foot Pole!
review/text: My dog seems to be allergic to poultry so we thought we would switch him to this lamb-based formula.  Usually he is a good eater, but my dog had one smell of this stuff and wouldn't come back.  I understand Wellness puts higher-end ingredients in their food but if a dog doesn't like it there goes your money right down the drain.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED
review/text: I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. But I just thought I'd try to give everyone a heads up though.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

review/summary: It's different than the ones from stores
review/text: The idea is great. Save trips to the store and is cheaper than the stores but when I opened the bag, it smelled funny and color is much lighter than the ones that I bought from the stores. My two Labradors actually turn their heads away from the kibbles. How do you return the opened bag with loose kibbles ? So I tried to feed the kibbles to the dogs and they were having diarrhea or very soft stool and I'm not happy with that type of situation at all. The Wellness dog food is good but something about shipping makes me wonder.... Anyway I went to the local pet store got the same kibbles and my babies are happy ever after.

review/summary: Good Going In, Bad Coming Out
review/text: After losing a dog at the age of 9, we looked into providing our pets with a better quality dog food just in case the Purina Pro Plan they had been eating was even partially responsible for her early death.<br /><br />The Wellness dry foods were one of the brands we tried. We took the effort to slowly introduce the food and gave it a good 4 months before finally giving up.<br /><br />Our dogs did not seem to really like this food. I am not sure if it was the taste or if it was the terrible gas or diarrhea it gave them. It would sit in their bowl for hours before they finally gave in and finished it.<br /><br />After much thought we decided that we would rather our dogs enjoy their food and not suffer from daily diarrhea than force them to eat this food, even if it might extend their life a little.<br /><br />We settled on Science Diet brand. They gobble it up at every meal and have returned to normal bowel movements. I realize the ingredients are not as good as Wellness brand, but I feel better about their quality of life.

review/summary: Oh my gosh!
review/text: I know this is going to sound crazy but my dog (who is usually pretty fussy about her eats) LOVED this food so much that I had to taste it.  I don't mind telling you--Wow!  Before she was finished her bowl of Wellness Dry Dog Food I was pouring myself a cereal bowl full.  Not only did I scarf that one up, I poured myself another heaping bowl of this dry goodness (by the by, it's even better wet).<br /><br />  Here's the really crazy thing about Wellnesss Dry, I don't even like sweet potato.  I don't know what spices they put in this, but kudos (kudogs?) to the chefs at Wellness.  They have provided a product that is good enough to double as munchies at my next party.  Oh, I almost forgot to mention how full and shiny my hair looks.  Keep doing what you're doing Wellness!

review/text: Got a wellness dog treat before which the dogs absolutely loved. Then i bought this dog food... very weird. None of my four dogs like it. Sniff, and go away. Regardless how good it is... if it can't even appeal to the dogs, it means nothing. Only one of my dogs is picky about food; others love almost every brand; esp. the 1st time they try a new dog food.<br /><br />Not this one. Embarrassing for me cuz I've opened it and can't return it.

review/summary: An Excellent Food
review/text: Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference!

review/summary: Good stuff and cheaper than vet bills
review/text: I have three dogs, a minpin, a lab, and an aussie pup. My min-pin got sick recently. It was pancreatitis and kidney problems. His liver was a mess too. After he got out of the vet hospital (800 bucks later) they wanted him to eat a prescription food that they sold. He hated it. Would NOT eat it.<br /><br />I got the Wellness through a reccomendation and it has been a life-saver. My minpin is healthy now. His liver is fine, as are his kidneys and pancreas. He looks years younger with his shiny coat. My lab and my pup are looking fabulous as well.<br /><br />Whats ironic is that I WAS feeding a supermarket wet food and it was costing me 90 bucks a month to feed these guys. Now, it's cheaper, they are healthier and they LOVE it. I have never seen dogs freak over dry food like they do over this.<br /><br />If you can afford it, I highly recommend this product. It saves you money in the long run and makes your pets happy and healthy.

review/summary: ALLERGIES DEALT WITH!!!
review/text: My black German Shepherd has allergies to corn & wheat, which seems to be the primary ingredients in most dog foods.  We suffered with her for years, cooking chicken, hamburger, rice to keep her healthy until we found the WELLNESS products.  They have turned her into a beautiful, not scratching or licking youthful dog.  We are also now feeding our lab and corgi the same foods with similar results.  Thank You Wellness!  (Incidentally the foods sold by the vet as hypo-allergenic had either corn syrup &/or wheat germ in it.  We read all labels now, all the way thru the fine print!)  Another added benefit for the larger dogs is the incorporation of glucosamine & chondroitin into it, saving additional vet bills.

review/summary: They Really Mean Improved!
review/text: Wellness has taken an already great product and improved it even further. I initially tried introducing Wellness to my black lab in 2003 and found her to be intollerant of the Lamb formula. So i put her on another food all the while hoping the Wellness formula would change a tad so i could try her on it again. I transitioned her onto the new Wellness about two weeks ago and she is doing fantastic!! She has a lot of food allergies and sensativities, but we have found the new and improved Wellness to work wonderfully for her. The high quality ingredients really do make a world of a difference - especially for a working dog!

review/summary: The best food!
review/text: I was concerned about the effect "regular" dog food was having on our dogs. We have one puppy and one senior, so both are in crucial stages. The puppy had bad dandruff and dull, course hair while the senior had various issues throughout his life including seizures and IBD. I decided to try a home cooked diet for them but after the pup developed an allergy I was scared to try anything else on my own. We decided to try Wellness after some research on the natural brands (not to mention a taste test with samples from Pet People).<br /><br />This food has done WONDERS. The pup no longer has dandruff and his coat is shiny and silky. His energy level is also through the roof. Our older dog has always been a veeery picky eater, sometimes going a couple days in between meals if it wasn't appetizing enough for him, but he loves the Wellness food and even eats it dry! No canned mix-ins necessary! Since he started eating it we haven't seen any IBD symptoms and he's acting a lot younger.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this food, or at least another brand of natural food. I encourage you to compare the ingredients in Wellness to regular food as even  "high-end" grocer brands (like Science Diet) contain the same junk as the generic ones!

review/summary: GOOD FOOD!
review/text: I have used this product for five years now for both of my shelties. They like the taste, there coats are much smoother and it has lessened the number of seizures my female gets and there severity. I will continue to use the fish and sweet potato food regardless of price.<br />Update:<br />On Thanksgiving day of 2010 my female sheltie passed away. This broke my heart, she was my best buddy. I can't help but think her Whitefish and Sweet Potato food had something to do with giving her a very long healthy life. She lived to be 17, and was playful up to the end. My vet agrees that this food and good exercise was instrumental in extending both my shelties lives. I now have a new sheltie puppy and a rescued 6yr old sheltie female. Needless to say they are both on Wellness brand Whitefish and Sweet Potato food. There snacks have always been Blue Dog Bakery products supplemented with fresh baby carrots.

review/summary: this cured my dogs allergies!
review/text: I have a Shih Tzu that will be soon turn 3.  I had her on a grain free Chicken diet until several months ago when she started having allergy problems.  Her constant licking and scratching drove me thru the roof.  My vet put her on a very expensive pill (like $60 a month), and recommended to me that I find her a diet with one "novel" protein.<br /><br />So, I went on-line and did some research.  Wellness was always something I was curious about.  I went on their website and found out that I could get some free samples.  After speaking with their customer service rep, I was informed that this Whitefish and Sweet Potato formula was their number one food recommended for dogs with allergies.  So, the company mailed me two trial size bags of this kibble.<br /><br />Well, it worked.  I've had my dog on this food for about 5 months now and she's completely stopped her licking and scratching in about a month.  I slowly weaned her off of her prescription allergy pill as well.  My vet is very, very impressed.<br /><br />I would give this food 10 stars if I could!

review/summary: Package and shipping issue
review/text: I rarely leave negative feedback, but I was shocked by how this product was packaged.  I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened.  First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing.  I'm fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped.  Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere.  Half of the bottom of the bag was open.  I lost at least half of the bag.  In addition, I don't know how long the bag was sitting opened.  It's probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know.  All I can say is I wouldn't buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store.  What I intended as a convenience of having this brand of dog food shipped directly to me, turned into a wasted amount of food and a lot of clean up.  I gave a shipping review to Amazon last week, but there was never any "I am sorry for your inconvenience" or any other type of apology.  I'm gathering these reviews are only spot checked.<br />The Wellness dog food itself seems to be a high quality dog food that my dogs enjoy.  I'm just very reluctant to purchase this through Amazon again.  If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have taken some pictures and posted them online. I was so irritated and it's just not worth the time for this particular product to do a RMA.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: For your overweight dog.
review/text: I have a 3 year old poodle the vet told me she was a little on the heavy side. I was recommended these dog food. She loves it and ive noticed that she has already dropped some pounds. The only con it is a little pricey. But if your loooking for a good deal shop here. Pets mart and Pet co will charge you 7.00 or more in shipping. Amazon gave me free shipping you can not beat that!!! and usually the stores wont carry such a large bag. Def a good product if your dog is unactive and overweight.

review/summary: Happy Chihuahua
review/text: My long haired chihuahua is overweight. Her ideal weight is approximately 6-7lbs, however she currently weighs approximately 9lbs (this is my fault, I overdid it on the treats). She loved her Wellness brand super5mix adult formula for small breeds kibble, but I recently noticed the small breeds weight reduction version being sold at PetSupermarket, and decided to switch her over.<br /><br />I was worried she would not like it, as I had once unsuccessfully tried to switch her over to the other Wellness Super5Mix weight control kibble (purple bag, normal sized kibble). Surprisingly she took to the taste of the Wellness Small Breed Weight Control kibble almost immediately. I didn't even need to ween her off of the Wellness original kibble, just gave her the weight control formula and she liked it, no problems with her digestion. The color of the kibble is slightly less brown than the original adult formula, but she did not seem to notice a difference at all. She likes the small size of the kibble, and recently I have noticed that she has lost about 4 ounces... not much but it is a start. Hopefully with exercise and some restraint by me, she will be within her normal weight range, but I am happy I made the switch and will continue to purchase this brand.<br />TIP: My dog is a picky eater, so I sometimes mix a bit of water into the food which causes the food to give off an aroma, which draws her to it. It also makes it easier for her to eat because it softens the kibble. It's also good because it keeps her hydrated... Just an FYI.

review/summary: The best dog food
review/text: This is a phenomenal pet food.  I have used it for 5 years with two dogs and it's wonderful.  First, they think that it's delicious of course and eagerly eat it day in and day out. Second, it's been crucial for my pet's health.  Dog 1 had allergies and was scratching and putting her paw into her mouth.  After going on this food, she no longer had those issues and her coat looks fab. She's a black lab mix.  Dog 2 was adopted with horrendous inflammatory bowel problems and suspected allergies to common proteins.  We had to start him on a very restricted diet of only novel proteins and chose the Wellness Simple food.  He didn't enjoy it as much and when he was stable, we switched him to this and he did great.  He loves it and it has kept his gut stable.  Also a lab mix and his coat looks great on this food.  We use both the Wellness fish kibble and canned food.  Highly recommend.  It's pricey but as someone else said, cheaper than the vet bills!

review/summary: Attention AMAZON:
review/text: I think Amazon is doing a disservice to Wellness Dry Dog Food by mingling all the reviews together rather than separating the opinions out, based on the particular type and "flavor" of the Wellness food being reviewed.  I was researching the food for SMALL BREEDS and zeroed in on that particular type, but the reviews were all over the place talking about many of the other varieties.<br />My experience with using the dry Wellness for Small Breeds, both the regular type and the Healthy Weight type has been excellent.  All out mini dachshunds love the food, have beautiful coats and are very healthy.  My only suggestion is that they offer the SMALL BREED variety in super size bags.  Buying 12 lbs at a time is ridiculous when one is feeding multiple dogs, and many of us with little guys, have more than one..... the potato chip theory, right?

review/text: This is it, look no further if you want a healthy, holistic dog food which supports  your dog immune system and keeps her weight under control. My dog was 2-3 pounds overweight and i had a very hard time finding a dog food which is good in nutritions and its low in fat. After 1 month my dog became lean and much more energized eating wellness healthy weight dog food. I believe all overweight dogs should be on this diet, its trully wonderful! I've tried other brands to help my dog lose those extra pounds, along with long walks, but this is the best! The best holistic weight management dog food.

review/summary: Best brand out there...
review/text: I have 7 dogs.  All various breeds and sizes.  I was looking for a brand without additives that all my dogs would benefit from.  I have a few that need to lose weight.  Wellness makes the best product.  I buy the small bites for my little ones....pieces are small and they love it.  I but the Healthy weightCORE for my "dieters" and mix it with canned green beans or peas and carrots.  So far my Golden, who was an overweight rescue at 129 pounds, has lost 19 pounds -- she's been on this food for about 7 months.  I buy the original CORE version for my baby bulldog, who had a lot of gas.  No more smells and ripples in the night!  Amazon has the best price for Wellness. And its shipped right to my home -- no lugging big bags back and forth.  Yes, it's more expensive than the other stuff--but it really works.  And that will cut down on future vet bills.  All my dogs are healthy and have nice shiny coats.  Priceless!  Wellness now has a SIMPLE version for those dogs who suffer with food allergies.  A family member has a little Teddy Bear with severe skin issues -- she'd scratch until raw and bloody.  She switched to the SIMPLE version of Wellness and has been itch free ever since.  Again...great brand!

review/summary: Stop the scratching!
review/text: Dogs probably don't really want to spend most of their lives scratching, but it seems that's what they do.  After trying many foods on two dogs, Wellness has stopped that.  It must be the natural ingredients because when I've tried "supermarket brands" they go back to scratching again.  Thanks, but I'll just stick with this.  Coats are shiny, even after swimming and mud baths.  It's expensive compared to "supermarket brands" but a bargain compared to other holistic dog foods and the vet bills we used to have!  Many years ago, we started feeding it to our black lab and he showed significant improvement in a couple of days.  After he died, (he was 14) we eventually got a golden retriever pup and tried him on the cheaper food but he showed the same signs of scratching and dull coat.  We put him on Wellness and all symptoms cleared up quickly.

review/summary: Perfect for mini schnauzer
review/text: First let me say that every time i read some of the dog food recipes on the labels i begin to think that there are real bits and pieces of fish in the bag. lol but no. This dog food is phenomenal. My miniature schnauzer had been on puppy chow before i got him.( not the best) however i made the foolish decision to transition a pure breed mini schnauzer from puppy chow to Purina One. And that's when the problems started. My dogs coat went from a nice black with brown highlights to a black coat with his pale white skin showing under it. He looked sooooo sick and his coat felt really dull and wiry. He refused to eat any more of the Purina one and so i had to think fast. I had remembered that a breeder website (bijou poodles i was thinking about getting one) had listed some top grade dog food as one of their links. So i so Wellness Core as a good choice. Well I decided to go with the fish and sweet potato recipe and my dog was not disappointed. He loves the food and has began to get a lot of his color back.<br /><br />Bag: Very loud bag package. Plus i don't really like the resealable feature since it does not come with a zip lock. However if my dog gets into the dog food bag the material food be so loud my neighbors wood here it.<br /><br />Smell: awesome he lost his cool as sooon as i cut the bag open.<br /><br />Quality/quantity: Wellness does not do like some companies and make the bag really big, while theirs less than half the dog food in the bag. 15 pounds is exactly that, 15 pounds. Also my mini would eat a lot of the puppy chow at one time. However with Wellness he only needs about a half a cup and hes full!

review/text: Wellness is by far the best dogfood we have ever fed our yellow lab.  Though it is expensive, we figure we spend the same amount  or less than we would through purchasing a cheaper food as we would need to feed more for the same caloric intake.  We get by with a thirty pound bag about once a month or so.  Our lab's coat is healthy, he has high energy, and his "movements" are solid... May be too much information.  However, that is one of the big differences I notice with cheaper dog foods.  To help with further comparison, our lab is 8 years old, is an active hunter nine months out of the year (waterfowl spring and fall, rabbits, upland birds), and he is an indoor family dog.

review/text: I will no longer feed my dog(s) standard grocery store foods though I did have a cocker spaniel live almost 17 years mostly on that before I knew better. This is a very good food. Good ingredients (meat should always be the first ingredient, not corn, wheat, etc). Can be a little pricey, so you may have to shop around, but it is worth it. You will occasionally find dogs that can't tolerate certain foods and this is no exception. So far hasn't been a problem for my dog after > 2 years of this particular type. Breed: Giant Schnoodle, ~66 lbs. He loves fish so this is perfect. If we're having fish for dinner (tuna, baked tilapia, etc), you can be assured he'll be nearby with his nose turned up somewhere sniffing around.

review/summary: My picky Husky loves this
review/text: I have a chow mix and a husky. My chow eats anything and is on the Wellness Healthy Weight (chicken flavor). My husky is really picky. She finally ate the Wellness puppy chow when she was a puppy after refusing to eat many other brands. At almost 2 years old I really wanted to change her to "big girl" dog food. She is still pretty skinny, because she is so active and still did not eat very much. I decided to switch her to the Wellness Core, but she constantly vomited. So I got the Wellness Fish and Sweet Potato since her puppy food had sweet potato in it too - hoping that she would eat it. NOPE. I guess she does not like fish!!! :-( Then I noticed that she likes my chows chicken flavored food, but the low calorie food was not ideal for her since she needs to put on a few lbs. So I finally tried this one ......... and BINGO ........... She LOVES IT!!! She can't get enough of it and always wants more. I am very happy with this food!!! And even better - it shipped from a location 30 min from my house, so ones it was shipped I had it the next day! The price is also about $10 lower than where I used to order Wellness before!!! So this is where I will always get it from now on! Thanks for fast shipping and a great price! I also recommend Wellness - its really a great food with real meat and NOT byproducts and tons of corn! ;) Your dog will love you for getting a great food!!! :)

review/text: My puppy loves it, and I love my puppy.  She doesn't eat a whole lot just yet, but she will soon.  Looks like it costs about $50-$60 for a month's supply.  Considering that I spend that much on myself in a week, I'll gladly spend that much on my sweet Layla for a month.  The better you spend on dog food, the less you'll spend in the veterinarian's office.  And that's exactly what I told my vet when I took her in for her rounds of shots, and she agreed wholeheartedly.  She only wants my money for routine office visits.  I firmly believe that Wellness dog foods will help ensure that you only take your beloved pet to the vet for routine maintenance.

review/summary: Picky dog gobbles it up!
review/text: I have two rescue chihuahua mix dogs (2yr old chiweenie 19 lbs. & 7mo jack-chi 9.6 lbs.). Both have started turning into butterballs from extra treats given during training as well as not enough walks, and could each lose 1-3 pounds. We've stepped up exercise but I still wanted a food that would help maintain their weight because they're both low to the ground and weight gain prone. My bf and I have been searching and searching for the "right" food to give them both. The choices and information on dog food is insane and combined with finding food they'll both eat is head spinning!<br /><br />The bigger/older one is super picky about all food and is known to spit out treats he doesnt like and to not even sniff new foods he hasn't experienced until u show him or break it up for him, but the little one will gobble anything in a flash. Previously we've had the oldest on Kirkland brand adult food and while he doesn't "love" it, he'll eat it with some waffling and overall its proven to keep him solidly healthy. After getting the 2nd pup who has typical jrt skin sensitivities I started researching foods to help him out and switched him from blue buffalo puppy to blue wilderness (also he stopped growing up and started growing out bc of too much puppy food richness which our older one also experienced when he was transitioning to adult). (As most know small dogs can stop growing much sooner compared to large dogs.) We tried to feed blue wilderness to the older one but found that he definitely turned his nose at it and given half and half portions preferred Kirkland over blue. In general I think blue is an awesome food but tends to be a little too calorie dense for our guys. Combined with their recent chubbiness and based on great reviews and ingredients, I decided to try Wellness Super5mix Healthy Weight for small breeds.<br /><br />We've only just bought some a few days go so I'll have to report back on weightloss, but we were super excited that based on first a small sample to each, then second when we mixed a meal with their old food they both immediately gobbled up the food. This is amazing because our oldest has always seemed to tolerate his kibble but hasn't ever loved any brands we've tried to date. This is the first time he's started eating a new food immediately!! My bf is also happy bc he would rather feed them the same thing than to have separate kinds for each like we were doing. I'm pretty sure we've found the "it" food that works for us!!!

review/summary: NOT involved in the recall
review/text: I have used this Wellness fish formula for 8 years for my dogs. This food is a super high quality food for dogs as well as having some healing attributes that make it very healthy for seizures and liver issues. My Schipperke's are doing very well on this formula and no longer require Phenabarb or any seizure medication and the liver studies on their blood work are almost normal at 13 years of age after serious liver problems 8 years ago.<br /><br />Wellness tests All batches for problems prior to distribution. They did give a voluntary recall on the puppy formula even when it tested out with no contamination. I also feed the senior dog formula to my 100 pound German Shepherd dog as I believe it has given him wonderful joint health help as he ages.

review/summary: Some Diamond Pet Food Wellness are RECALLED
review/text: I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. Just though I'd give a heads up though.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying.

review/text: This food has been really good for my dogs!  Their hair is softer and shinier, their eyes are clearer and their energy is better.  Even though this is much more expensive than the food I had been giving them I find it a bargain because after more than a year I see a profound difference in their appearance and health.<br /><br />Also buying through Amazon has been an excellent experience!  I usually have the food within a couple days, the shipping is free and my delivery guy even brings it in for me!

review/summary: Makes my beautiful dog more beautiful!
review/text: We have an 8 month old beagle mix.  We were given a bag of Science Diet when we brought her home from the shelter and she wouldn't eat that.  My daughter picked up a bag of Iam's puppy food and that's what we were giving her the first month. Her poops smelled so bad from day one when we got her and didn't improve on the Iam's.  She seemed to have consistently runny poops as well.  She was also constantly itchy and scratching at herself.  We switched to Wellness puppy food and after the initial introduction for her to get used to that brand we haven't looked back.  She loves it!  She is now on the adult formula even though she's not quite a year old (read that beagles should be switched over to adult food at about 6 months because they have reached their full height).<br /><br />We are finishing up her second bag on the adult formula and she is looking beautiful, sleek and healthy.  We have so many people comment about how pretty she is and, especially, how soft her fur is. Her poops rarely smell and when they do it is usually because she was given new treats/snacks or one she hasn't had in awhile.<br /><br />I have seen some reviews (mostly from the puppy formula) with people complaining about runny stools but it is important to gradually get your dog used to any new dog food and gradually build up the amount by mixing it with the dog food you are replacing.  We even did this when we switched from the puppy to adult formula even though it probably wasn't as necessary to do that as both were the lamb formulas.<br /><br />She's full of energy and very happy and seems to love her dog food as she always eats it up and sometimes will carry in her bowl looking for seconds!!<br /><br />Also love how fast this company ships out the dog food too!  Whoever was selling the puppy chow would take awhile for it to arrive but this one usually shows up in a day or two.  Do wish this was available at our local market though!

review/summary: after 10 years my dog feels great!
review/text: My dog is an 11 year old pitbull and has had a sensitive stomach, reoccurring chronic ear infections, and was always licking her paws since she was a puppy. She would get up to walk around and immediately throw up for no reason. This would happen sometimes several times a day. Her symptoms were similar to acid reflux in people.I took her to 3 different vets for these issues separately (never realizing they could all be connected). She was on nausea medications, antibiotics for her ears, and several different ear washes. Nothing completely cured any of her issues. After doing a lot of research, i came across Wellness white fish and sweet potato and couldn't be happier. Over a 10 day period, i slowly changed over her food from the Iams i had been feeding her. It has now been about 3 months and she is a completely different dog. Since fully switching over to this food, she hasn't thrown up once and she is no longer scratching at her ears. She has more energy and always wants to play. I no longer have to coax her into eating by mixing in wet food with the Iams. She wags her tail when she sees me filling her bowl now and eats right away. She even licks the bowl when she is done and looks at me for more. If your dog has any of the same symptoms my dog had, you should definitely give this food a try. It might not be a fix for every dog but it doesnt hurt to try. It worked for my dog!

review/summary: Excellent Dog Food For Some
review/text: I have a 6 year male old lab mix that has had numerous problems with allergies, skin irritations, and digestive issues that could not be fixed through steroid injections or expensive medications.  When he was young I fed him Beneful and he did okay for a bit and then he would have medical issues.  Through expensive medical treatment, we would get him back to normal but it was only a short time before the next outbreak.  I tried everything.  Supplement pills, different foods, allergy medication, steroids, limited diet and nothing seemed to work.  He would get better and then back to being bad with him constantly itching, chewing his skin, and he just looked miserable.  It seemed as though this cycle would never end.<br /><br />Then while visiting my brother who owns a collie recommended this food because I kept commenting on how healthy he looked and how soft his fur was.  I was hesitant at first because I had tried so much and nothing had seemed to work.  I gave the Wellness Super5mix whitefish and sweet potato a chance.  All I can say is that he no longer has ANY skin irritations, his fur is shinny and soft, he has a lot more energy, and overall I would say he is in his best health every.  The change came after about 3 weeks of him eating the food.  We use to have to bath him once a week and with the Wellness food we bath him maybe once a month.<br /><br />But I will say this food will not have the same effect for every dog.  As some of the others on here have stated that their dog had loose stool issues and the dogs simply refusing eating the food, this is very true.  My other dog has no allergies what so ever and I figured if it worked for the one dog it should be fine for the other so I would only have to buy one type of food.  The non-allergic dog began eating the Wellness and had immediate issues with loose stool and upset stomach.  So I keep him on his old food which is just the average food you would find in any pet store.<br /><br />Give it a shot if you have exhausted all other efforts.  All I can say is that my dog is in his best health ever and it was only due to a better diet and more attention and with the help of Wellness.  I would recommend this food to anyone who shares similar dog problems as I have experienced.

review/summary: Quality kibble from a brand you can trust
review/text: My dog was experiencing skin allergies and had actually chewed her tail down to the bare skin. Her once shiny, lustrous coat had become dull and flaky and she was putting on extra weight to boot. After a trip to the vet (where she got a clean bill of health but I was told that she was about 8 pounds too heavy) I immediately switched her to this food and scaled back her portions on the advice of the vet. It's been about 6 weeks and the results are clearly visible. The scratching and the hot spots are gone, the coat gleams once again and the dog has shed most of the excess pounds.....she really seems to enjoy the kibble and happily scarfs it down when put in her bowl.<br /><br />Dogs react differently to different foods but I highly recommend giving this one a shot. It's worked wonders for my pup.

review/text: After two years on Eukanuba lamb and rice i thought i would try a different food for my choc lab just to give him a bit of variety.<br />He likes the food alot not surprisingly but the difference is after three weeks of eating it is that he is alot hungrier than he was before, his poop is alot looser, he is thirstier and his breath is not good. His coat condition and enery levels are very good though so a mixed bag for me over all. I will likely go back to the previous food with the next order.

review/summary: Worth the price
review/text: I adopted a 6 month-old dalmation-pit recently and when I brought him home he had watery, disgusting smelling stools. I tried Natural Balance, which didn't really make a difference, and Before Grain, which he liked but it didn't have any effect on his poop. I did some research and decided to try the chicken super5mix and after mixing it into his food for about a week or so his stools became significantly less watery and it takes him about half the time to do his business than before (where I would watch him struggle and it looked painful and sad :( wonder what they fed him at the shelter ). He's my first puppy and I noticed that after a long time in the sun/we go out for a jog, he would have this weird funky smell like rotting chicken. I'm guessing that's his sweat smell. After about two weeks on Wellness the smell decreased SIGNIFICANTLY! His coat is also glossier. Leonidas hasn't been on this food for that long so I'm a bit hesitant to attribute the change just to food.. but I really think that's what it is. Bought the 15-lb bag to test it out last time, just ordered the 30. I'll try to remember to update this after he finishes it :)<br /><br />P.S. he also has MUCH less gas. win-win for both Leonidas and myself (but more for myself)

review/text: We rotate foods with our one year old. Went from a poultry mix to the fish and his coat is so much softer after only three weeks. Seems to be extremely palatable, and our pup had no issues switching over. He's extremely active so we've been feeding him a little more than the recommended amount on the bag, and his weight and energy level have remained constant. Wonderful food thus far -- no stomach or gas problems, just a mild case of fish breath. Would recommend to anyone!

review/summary: Too High On Carbs, Low On Protein
review/text: I am not rating this food with three stars because I dispute the quality of ingredients, or that it's one of the healthiest commercial dog food available on the market. Wellness is an excellent brand, more importantly, one whose quality control I trust. My dogs are doing fairly well on it, too, however, the reason I cannot give the Super 5 Mix a five star review is for the unusually low levels of protein and fat, which are not suitable for my highly active Beagles.<br /><br />My dogs spend as much time outdoors as they do snoring on the couch (which is a lot), and unfortunately, the 22/12 ratio of fat:protein does not cut it for them. By most standards 22% is a very low amount for even a maintenance diet, and despite the inclusion of whole grains, fruits, and veggies, I've found that I need to add oils and meat on a daily basis because their coats have been thinning out/shedding more than usual and their muscle mass has definitely decreased in the several weeks I've been feeding it. I'm very disappointed because it's only the middle of summer, when they normally maintain their coat very well and are less active than in the cooler months. Energy levels are also not very good... I am seeing spikes and crashes which is usually indicative of a high carbohydrate feed, so alas, will have to find another, more meat based diet for my pack. Although I would still recommend this for less active dogs - it's just not right for mine.

Sometimes mild ear irritations would come back, although in a very mild form as compared to before.<br /><br />A few months ago, we decided to try the Wellness Chicken, and the ear problems are gone. Another benefit is, so is their Gas!<br /><br />The dogs love the food, are still just as active, and look just as healthy as they always have. Plus they love helping open the box that the food comes in when picked up off of the front porch!<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon and Prime we do not have to search pet stores that are always out of this stuff, and we can have dog food on our doorstep within 2 days! All of this without paying crazy shipping costs.<br /><br />Keep it up Amazon, and Wellness.

review/text: Im a vet tech and I have researched many brands. This is one of the best with quality ingredients, a good nutritional balance, and value. I only feed dry food to my dogs, but occasionally will give some Wellness canned food. My dogs love it, well worth the price.

review/summary: A fiery cinnamon mint that you get addicted to!
review/text: My wife and I just love these fiery cinnamon mints.  They are the best breath fresheners around and they work quickly.<br /><br />The biggest issue is that we put a box in each of our cars and several around the house.  We even carry a few extras in the car as we use them and like to have a backup.  Because we were always running out we started buying them by the 12 pack and keep them in our pantry.<br /><br />They stay fresh as they are individually wrapped and they are in a convenient metal tin to carry around.  They are also a better buy when you get them by the 12 pack!

review/summary: Long lasting flavor...
review/text: I thought these were expensive when I first bought some, but when I found out you can only eat one at a time, the price seemed more reasonable. These are very strong and you really can only eat one at a time and if you put 2 or 3 in your mouth at once, you may be breathing fire! They are great for your breath and great for stopping you from snacking too. I use the little cans to store buttons and other sewing notions in when I'm done with the mints.

review/summary: all right by me !!!
review/text: Cinnamon Altoid mints REALLY do a fine job of making your breath fresh with their extra strong cinnamon flavor. For some people these may taste a little too strong, perhaps; but I enjoy them very much. Of course, being that these have a cinnamon flavor they make for great candy as well. They're delicious.<br /><br />Altoid mints are very low in calories, fat, sodium and more. The main effect, therefore, is simply to make your breath as fresh as it could ever be. They taste great as candy, too. They come in that famous little tin that keeps them fresh until their expiration date.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend Altoids as THE ultimate in breath mints. People who also simply love that strong cinnamon taste will delight in these, too.

review/summary: Hard to find
review/text: I decided to quit smoking and purchased a tin of the cinnamon altoids to curb my cravings. It has worked amazing, everytime I want to smoke I grab two altoids. The only problem is I seem to have bought out the stores around our town and spent 45 minutes today going all over town and no one had the cinnamon ones left, finally I found some and purchased the case. The other flavors are available everywhere but they need to expand the distribution of the cinnamon flavor.

review/text: I was in the check-out lane at Publix today when I realized that I forgot to get peppermints like I had planned to. I didn't want to put everything back in the cart and get out of line, so grabbed these. Wow! I'm sold. They're too intense for me to eat more than 1 at a time, so that will make them last awhile. No more gum or peppermint buying for me!

review/summary: Fantastic "mints" from a British brand...Not available in Britain!!
review/text: I am lucky...In a way. I have family and friends in the states that keep me stocked with Altoids in their various flavours. We in the UK, sadly can rarely acquire only the peppermint variety (at huge cost) despite Callard and Bowser being a british brand (I know its just a name now.)<br /><br />Still that niggle aside. Altoids are truly the best "mints" money can buy. Nothing else hits the spot and added bonus the metal (how nice that its not "made in china" plastic!) tin doubles up for all sorts of useful things.

review/summary: feel the burn!
review/text: In place of working out, I simply have a three of these at a time, and trust me, you feel the burn.  A perfect amount of sharpness and cinnamon flavor.<br /><br />Starting slowly with other gateway mints and other weak cinnamon gums (hello, Big Red!) I moved on to these and am now at a steady tin-a-week user.  At that quantity, cost was starting to impact my finances, so I have had to move up to bulk packaging.  My thanks to Amazon for a good price on this level of quantity, as retailers are usually over $2.00 per tin.  Though I have been a fan of numerous other Altoids mints, these cut through anything (coffee, morning breath, afternoon doldrums, general malaise, office bitterness).<br /><br />Time for another three!

I hope this bit of info helps encourages more competitive pricing on Amazon.  Otherwise, you can't beat the convenience of getting your fix here!

review/summary: My favorite gluten free mints...
review/text: A few years ago, I found out that I had to avoid foods with gluten.  I like to carry mints in my purse, but found out that the selection of gluten free mints was slim.<br /><br />Then I tried cinnamon altoids.  They are gluten free and I love them!  They are convenient and slip easily in my purse or desk drawer.  They take away bad breath...and if you're feeling sleepy they will help you stay awake.<br /><br />Sure, they are strong.  They're Altoids!  If you like cinnamon and you like spicier/flavorful foods - you will probably like these.  People who can only handle mild foods will probably find these too strong.  I think they're great.  I try to always have a tin of these in my purse.

review/summary: Altoids Cinnamon
review/text: These are excellent. I buy them in bulk from Amazon (vs. buying individual containers in the local shop) since I end up consuming them quite a lot. The cinnamon fresheners are quite as adevrtised and very tasty. In fact, the main downside is that you end up eating quite a few as candy vs. mouth fresheners. And the service from Amazon is excellent - I buy most of my gifts and many of my personal items from Amazon. Their selection is great, the reviews are very useful, service is superb and there is the fast shipping with Prime. Highly recommend Amazon and these Altoids.
