review/summary: Yuk...worst fiber cereal
review/text: This is the worst tasting fiber cereal I have ever eaten! It was so bad I would have sent it back, but I am living in the middle of the South Pacific and it would have been too costly.  It tasted like unpoped popcorn kernels, gets stuck in back of throat, and has an after taste.  Yuk!  I feed it to the chickens. Don't waste your money on this.

review/summary: Worst than the worst airplane food
review/text: The mac and cheese with peas and corn is probably one the most disgusting things i've ever eaten. Yes, i ate it because after opening it i wouldn't dare feed it to my toddler. It even looks nasty. The vegtables have this grayish hue. It leaves the worst after taste as well. It just can't be good for you. Be nice to your child - don't feed this to them.

review/summary: Expensive and limited
review/text: The Graduates entrees are good to experiment with when your little one is first moving on to "real" food - you can gauge the size your toddler's appetite and his tastes for instance, and they are reasonably well balanced meals. However, there are more drawbacks than benefits in my personal opinion. There are nine varieties, but some are so similar to each other the selection is actually quite limited. Some (the mac & cheese & the pasta/sauce combos) veer too close to the fast food end of the spectrum for me - if your toddler gets hooked on these early you will have a revolt on your hands when you start trying to feed him meat-and-two-veg type meals. Also they are VERY expensive for what they are. The mac & cheese is the worst; Graduates work out at well over $2 per individual meal, while you could easily make a batch and freeze it in single portions at home for about 15-20c per serving.<br /><br />I found them quite useful as an inspiration to find out what my daughter would eat and how I could cook for her myself; in fact I only ever bought about a half dozen of them and I kept the trays to use for home cooked meals. I imagine it would be useful to keep a few on hand to send to daycare when you don't have time to make lunch yourself, or for the babysitter to have something easy to feed the kids, or even for last-minute trips to Grandma's - but I don't think these alone should be relied on to provide the bulk of a toddler's meals.

review/summary: Great vitamins even for picky kids
review/text: My 4 year-old daughter is very picky when it comes to multivitamins.  First, she tried the Metagenics children's, but couldn't stand the orange flavor.  We had tried another mango multivitamin that she liked, but when they changed the flavor to lemon, she wouldn't eat them.  We tried another juice-type multivitamin, but it made her gag.  Finally, we tried these, she LOVES them.  And she thinks they are extra fun because they look like candy gumdrops.<br /><br />The only warning...make sure they stay out of the reach of children in case they would think they are candy and overdose.  Yes, the bottles have childproof caps, but that doesn't guarantee anything.

review/summary: yummy + natural! love these!
review/text: i'm virtually never enthusiastic enough about a product to seek out where to post a review about it, but i LOVE these! i really don't like gumdrops or gummy bears/worms/whatever, so i was a little skeptical. but having all-natural products, no artificial flavors, sweeteners, or other additives is really important to me--i'm not a hippie, just someone who feels better when i steer clear of those things and knows that some, for instance, trigger some health problems. so i bought a bottle of these and am WOWed. they are super tasty, smooth and not overly gummy, no fake aftertaste, just yummy citrusy not-too-sweet flavor. these are my new multivites of choice, and i'm now going to seek out other products by nordic naturals.

review/summary: Best multi-vitamin!!!
review/text: I've been searching for a multi-vitamin that my children woudn't cringe at the sight of being offered.  I've finally found it in Nordic Naturals Nordic Berries!  We have tried other various vitamins--the hard chewable kinds as well as other gummies--and none of them fit the bill for both natural goodness and tastiness as Nordic Berries do.  The Animal Parade chewables were extremely hard, to the point of being difficult to chew, on top of a super tart, undesirable taste.  Other, more commerical gummy vitamins, left us with the feeling that we were merely giving our kids sugary treats without much benefit of actual vitamins.  I'm thrilled to have finally found a vitamin that provides essential nutrients and a much liked texture with a yummy taste that my children (& I and my husband) love!  As it says on the bottle, "for adults and kids alike"...so we can all take them!

review/text: I can't say enough about Nordic Naturals Nordic Berries.  I was desperate for something healthy for my two very picky kids.  I had tried so many different products, some of which I was surprised they would not take (maybe kids' taste is more sensitive?).  This product hit the mark.  My kids actually get upset when we run out, and remind me to order more.  They love it and I'm comfortable with Nordic Naturals as a company (check their website and see how they ensure the purity of their products).  5 stars!

review/summary: Arsenic in multi-vitamins
review/text: For the last 2 years I have been giving my 4 year old these berries.  He loves them and we trusted Nordic Naturals.<br />Over the past few weeks, there has been a lot of attention given to the fact that rice syrup is highly contaminated with arsenic.<br />Nordic berries are sweetened with rice syrup solids so I approached the company about it.<br />Judge for yourself but I am going to hold off on these until I get more satisfactory answers:<br /><br />From Nordic Naturals after my call inquiring about arsenic in their multi-vitamins:<br /><br />We have run an arsenic analysis on our berries in the past and the total Arsenic level has never reached 1% of the standard set in California. Our QA manager is supremely confident there is no concern about arsenic in the Nordic Berries. The  amount of brown rice syrup solids in the Berries is less than 0.5% per serving and the levels found in the past are barely detectable.<br /><br />A recent article in Consumer Reports was focused on Inorganic Arsenic, which is much more dangerous than Organic Arsenic, so our QA manager has sent out a sample to be tested for Inorganic Arsenic. As soon as we have that result I will share it with you.<br /><br />This was my response so I could review the information she provided on my own:<br /><br />Thanks a ton for keeping me in the loop.  I have a couple of questions about your email.<br />When you ran the arsenic analysis in the past, what was the actual arsenic number found?  Also what California standard are we talking about - what number is the standard?<br /><br />Here is their answer:<br /><br />Unfortunately, pollution is a reality and removing all of it from the food source is not always possible. We have always been committed to delivering the safest and most effective products in the world but trace amounts of some pollutants are unavoidable. I do not have the specifics to answer your question but trust that our management team is working on a more complete response. In the mean time I ask for your patience.<br /><br />Honestly, if they are going to tell me their 1% of arsenic found and quote standards set in California, I believe they should tell me the details.<br /><br />For a company that I absolutely, wholeheartedly trusted for my son's vitamins and DHA, I am disappointed with their answer so far.

review/summary: tasty gummy-based vitamin
review/text: They have a tangy sour-sweet flavor, and seem to be natural-based ingredients and a good balance of the vitamins & minerals.  Note that a daily serving is 4 berries...we didn't bother with that many but did 1-2/day just as an extra supplement to my child's diet.  They do tend to get a little harder and stick together in the jar as time goes on, like any natural gummy "candy" (note that these do have cane juice & tapioca/rice syrups to make them sweet).  I liked that they say these are manufactured in a facility "certified to be free of allergens derived from milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, or soy" and that they are gluten-free with no artificial colors or flavors.

review/summary: Great for teens too
review/text: I found these vitamins because my teens tasted them at a demo table at whole Foods.  They were not taking their other vitamins, not even when I reminded them.  So when they asked for these, I thought "Why not?"  And I went to Amazon and bought them.  Now my kids remind ME when it is time to buy more.  They are expensive, but my kids' health is important to me, and if they take these, and waste the other vitamins because they don't take them, these really become a bargain.  I like them too- but I just can't justify taking them, since I actually remember to take the boring multi vitamin.  But if I had my druthers, I'd take these too.

review/summary: Great Price
review/text: I had been buying this product elsewhere until I found it on Amazon for a much better price. It is a very easy way to get your children to take their vitamins, as they taste great and are soft versus chewy.  The quality of the Nordic Naturals products is very high and recommended by both my physician and holistic nutritionist.

review/summary: I put these in almost everything I eat!
review/text: I  first tried these from a grocery store olive bar. At home, I tasted one, said "WOW!", ate them all one at a time from the jar, then said "I have GOT to get more of these!".<br /><br />Peppadew (a trademark name) is an astoundingly sweet red pepper (not sweet like "sweet peppers", sweet like fruit juice).  They're round and about an inch wide. They come hollowed out, in vinegar.  According to the website, they were only discovered by science in the 21st century because they only grow in one corner of an obscure county in some south African country where they evolved.<br /><br />Peppadews are the only thing I know that is both sweet enough to serve as a dessert, but will make, literally, any savory food better.  I know because I put them in, literally, every savory food I make.<br /><br />I originally chopped them up mixed with sliced olives to put on my favorite food, Italian sausage sandwiches.  Then I put them on pizza, and every sandwich of every kind.<br /><br />They're served whole.  When fresh, they're crunchy. But after several days sitting in an open jar unrefrigerated, they get squishy.<br /><br />The store stopped having an olive bar and I had a real (but minor) crisis in my life. See, I'm a 34yo homeless woman and live in a cozy cave in the woods (okay, a cozy tent.  Whatever.) I hacked into the power grid.  Anyway, eating is really the only "event" in my whole day, so anything I can eat that makes me so happy and delighted that I look forward to it is a big deal to me. Cotton candy is like that too.<br /><br />These peppadew peppers are SO good that when the grocery store stopped selling them I thought I'd never see them again (because I had never seen them before).<br /><br />Since then, I have found (and bought) them at amazon. I now get them from the gourmet department of a liquor store, where I buy every jar they have.  It's the same price as online, but online, the cost is doubled because of shipping.<br /><br />I read that they're thinking of selling peppadew juice.  I never throw any juice away because the liquid tastes just like the peppers, and you can put it in anything liquid (like spaghetti sauce).<br /><br />Warning: the peppadew hot sauce doesn't taste anything like the peppers.  It tastes like any generic hot sauce.<br /><br />Also, the yellow (ripe) ones are even milder, but lack flavor.  Do NOT get the kind sold as "hot" unless you're putting it in soup or something, where the hot flavor will be sucked out and distributed. Get the mild ones.<br /><br />Order some right now (seriously!). PS: pix of me in my cozy cave: tiny url dot com slash kanecave

review/text: The title may not even sum up the awesomeness that is Stacy's Pita Chips. Crunchy, lightly flavored, and strong enough to dip in your favorite humus (or anything else) these are great chips. While this specific product is only the Naked version, the other flavors are quite good as well.<br /><br />Twelve bags is a great deal, especially if you subscribe. It is a lot of chips to go through in the six months, but just bring a bag and some humus to parties, get-togethers, or anywhere where you can imagine eating pita chips. You'll also find that they disappear faster than you'd think due to how good they are.

In my opinion, this is the best muesli out there.<br /><br />I love it mixed with some french vanilla yogurt.  It makes a wonderful and healthy meal or snack.  I highly recommend it.  The only problem -- it seems to take a long time to get it restocked since it is being imported from Australia.

review/summary: Teisseire Framboise Raspberry Syrup
review/text: I was very disappointed with this product.  It is mostly sugar syrup with some raspberry flavoring (15%).  The raspberry taste is very weak, being overwhelmed by the lemon and other berry flavor.  Another brand that I ended up purchasing as a replacement was far better, but I admit it cost a lot more. I wish the ingredients had been viewable before receiving it (at least I couldn't find a link to see what the ingredients were). Perhaps the bottle that I got was too old, though the date on it says 02/2011.

review/summary: Slightly sweet, but overall good flavor
review/text: I really enjoy drinking flavored soda and tonic water.  It doesn't take much of this raspberry syrup to make a nice refreshing drink. A little less sugar and a little more raspberry would be nice, but this product is good for the price.

review/summary: Very mellow...almost flavorless
review/text: Maybe if I used two pods, I might get the desired flavor out of a small cup of coffee?  I don't know.  I didn't taste any chocolate or buttercruch...or even coffee for that matter.  To the contrary, all I could taste out of one of these pods was the half pouch of Splenda I used to sweeten it.  Maybe I got an old pod, but I think it's pretty fair to say that I won't be buying these separately.  They are marginally better than the ones you can buy directly from Senseo.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Made this for the first time a couple of week's ago. I have found that much of Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free items are very good, so I tried these when I had a craving for corn bread. It was delicious! My only recommendation would be to make these in cupcake tins instead of the large pan it recommends and to add a little butter into the mix.<br />Overall, I am not a very good at cooking, and these were easy to make and came out great (despite my lack of kitchen skills). Many of my non-gluten-free friends also liked these. Would recommend to any one on a GF diet or anyone wanting to try something different.

review/summary: Surely This Is a Miracle
review/text: (I could not write this fast enough -- and I hope that I won't have to retract/edit it...)<br /><br />  My 3-yr-old great-grand-daughter is my official "squirrel scold," and she has been over-worked. So I bought this product, and last evening we sprayed the wooden feeder on the tree and the hanging feeder near it. Then we bravely filled both with supreme high-tech feed -- with the peanuts and all that for the "desirable" birds.<br /><br />  This morning we approached the front window and were amazed. There were 50 birds out there having the time of their lives without squirrel intrusion! As we watched, squirrels climbed the tree, detoured around the sprayed feeder, and made a u-turn. They also avoid the hanger.<br /><br />  All they do now is hang around beneath the feeders picking up spilled seed. That's okay by me.<br /><br />  As for cats and deer and all: not my problem.<br /><br />  My little helper can now retire -- but she still hollers at the furry guys.

review/text: We had high hopes for this product and when we sprayed it on it was so noxious to us that we thought that it would be effective. However, within seconds ( it was not even dry yet ) the squirrels were back and it had absolutely no effect on them. We stood and watched as 3 squirrels descended up on the bird feeder and began eating, soon even more squirrels arrived and stood on the top of the feeder what was still glistening with the product. We sprayed the surrounding area  as well as the feeder itself until wet and dripping and it had absolutely no effect on both the adult and baby squirrels......don't waste your time.

review/summary: FAIL!
review/text: This product fails to repel rats.  Period.  My sister had a rat come down from the ceiling into her cabinet where she came face to face with it eating a bag of rice.  It ran and she called me.  We took everything out of the cabinet, vacuumed the droppings and then saturated the cabinet with Critter Ridder.  I also went into the attic and sprayed all over.  We waited a day, and then when she opened the cabinet to put everything back, the rat was again staring her in the face!  At that point I tried another repellent called Repels All<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E4R2SO">Bonide 238 1-Quart Shot-Gun Repels-All Animal Repellent Ready To Use</a>.  I again saturated the inside of the cabinet with it and also sprayed in the attic.  In addition, I threw some rat bait into the cabinet.  Next day, the rat poison was GONE, and droppings were left in it's place.  Repels All had different ingredients but also FAILED.  The guy at Do-It-Yourself Pest Control said these items didn't work, but I didn't want to use a trap and have to clean up the mess.<br /><br />At that point I put more rat poison in the cabinet and I can hear the rat eating it right NOW!  Total heebee geebees.  I'm not sure if the CONTRAC rat and mice killer is working yet, but I know that the rats love eating it.

review/text: My husband and I wanted this sauce to make a fried shrimp recipe so we ordered the 3 9.6 oz combo.  It took a few weeks to arrive, but we felt that since it was imported from Thailand it would take some time.  We were so surprised when we received the package to find that we had received two (2) 32 oz bottles of the YUMMY sauce with a little note on the invoice 'we ran out of 9.6 oz bottles, sorry'.  Sorry?  Don't be sorry!  We are so happy!  The shrimp recipe was perfect with this sauce. And now we have enough to share with friends. We will definitely be buying more products from [....].  Thanks so much!

review/summary: Nice bag, but...
review/text: The hemp bag is well constructed and easy to use. The problem I had was that my sprouts (Mung Bean) stayed incredibly small.  I am sprouting beans from the same batch in a mason jar and by day two, their size is more than twice that of day seven in the bag.  Both batches were rinsed on the same schedule.  The jar is harder to drain, but given the difference in the end product, I think it is worth the extra work.  I haven't tried the lentils or the peas yet.

review/text: I'm buying 2 new sproutbags today, and I prefer this kit to getting just the bag for about the same cost. I wouldn't even be in the market, but I ruined the bag I've had for 3 years by soaking it in a rusty metal tin on accident. My bad! I used to have a Sproutmaster 3-Tray system, but I gave it away because this sproutbag is all I need. It's sturdy and works like a charm every time. After three years of use mine was looking pretty dingy, but that's what happens to things when nature has touched them. Solid product.

review/text: We first tasted this gem of an olive oil in a little restaurant in Taormina this March.  I was so taken with it I have ordered it and taken delivery.  I will continue to order this special Extra Virgin Olive Oil .<br /><br />As for taste it is exceptional.  The aroma is fresh cut fields. It's taste is subtle vegetation and mineral which is blended impeccably.  I find the 2010 slightly better than the 2011, but both are keepers.  Your final drizzle over fish, vegetables or veal, pork and chicken provides an enriched palate enlivening but soothing taste without jeopardizing the intended result of the dish.<br /><br />Highly recommend and through Amazon, your delivery is safe.<br /><br />Al C

review/summary: Where have you been all my life!
review/text: Can't believe I'm only the second person to review these! I've actually been served these at a restaurant in hollywood and a cafe in beverly hills...i finally remembered to track them down and order them. They are every bit as good as I remember them. I've actually found a grocery store I buy them from now and have tried about half the blends they offer. These definitely have that wow factor the first time you see them, everyone i've shown them to goes nuts. Make sure you do NOT try to tear the stick open, there are holes in the stick that the water goes through to brew the leaves. It's extremely convenient and kind of addicting stirring the stick around and brewing the tea that way. I take it straight so no sugar or anything else. I've liked all the one's i've tried and a few were super delicious. (peach green tea, chamomile and passion black tea are my favorite ones so far) I could see how a hard core tea drinker who would want that really bold astringent taste might be a littler underwhelmed.  At least the blends I've tried don't fit that category, but they have a really nice taste and are the smoothest teas I've ever drank. Definitely recommend them and suggest you give them a try if you're a tea drinker, I'm seriously hooked :)
