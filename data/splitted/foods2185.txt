review/summary: Gross!
review/text: I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received.  I ordered the variety pack and am very disappointed.  All flavors have a really weird taste to them, except for maybe the plain chips.  The salt and vinegar especially tasted gross!  I took one bite and had to throw the bag away.  Now I'm stuck with a bunch of chips that I'll never eat.

review/summary: To me, "Original" flavor just nasty tasting.
review/text: Unfortunately, I somehow stumbled upon this product and, based on all the glowing reviews, bought a case.  Upon opening the first bag and eating a couple, I was disgusted by the taste.  Worst thing I've ever ordered from Amazon---and I've ordered a lot.  I don't think the nutritional values are all that great, either.

review/summary: Quality not what you find at local retailers
review/text: I purchased two types, the original and the salt and vinegar. The original tasted burned, they were very tan/brown in color.  The vinegar were very sour.  Both cases were trashed & Amazon handled credit asap.  I have purchased these in grocery stores & airports and never had this quality problem.  These are pricey that's why I jumped at the great price Amazon offered this product.  Does Amazon got seconds?

review/summary: Too strong IMO
review/text: I bought the popchips variety pack to try the different flavors and I kept an open mind but I just don't like this flavor.  Their other flavors like BBQ & salt and vinegar are great, but these are REALLY peppery.  I can't even taste the salt on them because the pepper is so overwhelming.  Might be your bag of tea if you like a lot of pepper on food, but my husband puts pepper on everything and even he said there was too much pepper here.

review/summary: They have a strange taste. Much worse than baked Lays or Pringles.
review/text: I was disappointed with the taste of these chips (regular and barbecue). I can't really taste the potato, so it is almost like eating a badly-flavored foam chip. It tastes like it is stale even though it is fresh, and it also has an odd chemical-like taste. The similar baked lays and pringles chips are very tasty. My kids finally ate the rest of these chips, but only after all of the other chips were gone.

review/summary: Healthy really?
review/text: I was excited to buy these "chips" and try them out since they are supposed to be a healthier alternative. But these things are super super salty.  What it lacks in oil, it makes up for in salt.  I would not consider these things healthy at all.  I bought these for my toddler but I didn't know why he only ate 2 pieces before giving up until I tasted them myself. I even opened a 2nd and 3rd bag just to make sure the first bag wasn't just a fluke.  Don't waste your money on these.  Stick w/ the baked chips!

review/summary: Lacks flavor
review/text: Because I like sweet potatoe fries, I thought I would like these.  But, I found them to lack flavor.  There is just a bit of a bitter taste to them.  They may be better for you than potato chips, but they just don't give the same satisfaction.  However, they are not very salty and are in a 100 calorie pack which makes them healthier for you. I thought maybe it was just me, so I had my husband and sister try them.  They each gave them a 2.5 rating.  My sister said they were a bit bland.  Hubby said they weren't too bad.  But, none of us are excited about eating another bag.

review/summary: A nice alternative
review/text: I shared these with friends at work.  The consensus is that they taste good, if not quite what some people expected.  Those who enjoy sweet potato fries liked them better than those with no experience in that area.  Price would be a consideration for everyone who tasted these, but not necessarily the overriding issue.  I personally enjoy them.  I'd look for them in a larger bag over a snack-size bag, mostly because I'm cheap that way.  Nobody said they were nasty or that it was something they'd never choose.

review/summary: WAY better than I expected
review/text: The label says they're popped, rather than fried or baked.  However they did it, these are great chips!  They're very nicely seasoned such that I don't think you'd be inclined to dip them, though they're certainly sturdy enough to.  The flavor is a nice balance sweet and salty with not too much of either. At 100 calories a bag, 3 grams of fat (no saturated, no trans fat), 16g carbohydrates and 230mg sodium per bag they're also great nutritionally.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but in this form they are terrific!  All five of us in this house from age 9 to 50-something are fans.<br /><br />I wish I was better at describing flavors but you'll just need to try them for yourself.

Within a week of their birthday, Amazon e-mailed me that it was available. Great chips but, took longer to ship then expected. Just in the nick of time for the birthday. When you want something real bad, Amazon usually comes through.

Every time I eat these chips I feel like I am taking a whiff of the old codger's rear, and it brings back memories. Sometimes I just open up a bag and deeply inhale the crotchety old aroma. Scottyboy and I eat these by the dozens, and I requested them so much that ol Scottyboy, who's in charge of snack purchases, bought these in bulk, which makes up for the week he bought ten boxes of edible strawberry underwear for the office.

If you are looking for these as a substitute for potato chips, forget it.  They really do taste like dissolving cardboard.  Stick with baked Lays!

We do not like the dry and more on the salty taste of these chips. I will no longer make purchases on items that I can try buying at the store first before investing in buying by bulk and saving online. Do not purchase these chips unless you already tried them before.

review/text: I like all kinds of snack foods and potato chips. The regular kind, kettle cooked, and the "modified" potato snacks such as Munchos (my favorite) Pringles, Lay's Baked, etc.<br /><br />But not these. They have almost a styrofoam consistency...so they aren't really crisp and snappy, just hard. Like stale styrofoam. Now, I could learn to live with the texture, but the flavor is odd, too. . Almost like an unnatural type of flavor. My husband doesn't even usually notice or comment on flavors in snack foods(just sorta eats,) but he said "I don't like these, they taste funny. Don't buy these again." My 12 year old kids wouldn't even eat them. Maybe the ones with flavoring (like BBQ) cover it up, but not with the plain.

review/text: I understand many people love these things, but I bought the sea salt and vinegar popchips and I hated them. I LOVE regular  potato chips lay's and other brands. These popchips not only taste bad but they have a bad after taste to me.<br />I think these popchips must be for "heath" type people who try to convince themselves these taste good.<br />We like what we like and we all have different experiences about this type of thing.<br />After reading so many positive reviews I thought these would be good.<br />They taste "hallow", "empty", too artificial chemical taste.<br />With a regular potato chip I get the "that's it" sensation, satisfying, full flavor.

review/summary: Dissappointing
review/text: To quote another reviewer, I can't understand the high praises these chips have been receiving.<br /><br />Based on their popularity and high review score I ordered the 6-flavor variety pack off of Amazon. With some excitement I tore open the packaging and tried the various flavors. I was met with disappointment. Texture-wise, these chips are not crunchy at all and are unsatisfying. The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call "salt and vinegar" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar). I then went to the corner shop across the street and bought some salt & vinegar Kettle chips.

review/text: We love pop chips at our house, they are a great addition to a Weight Watchers diet. They are kind of pricey when they are regular priced at the store, So we buy them in bulk either on Amazon, or when they go on sale at CVS pharmacy. Our favorite flavor is the BBQ. Great snack, no guilt!

review/summary: Love the texture and the flavor
review/text: I'm a big fan of Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, so my daughter decided to surprise me with these new Popchips.  I really like the different texture...light, tender, and crisp.  The salt and vinegar taste is strong and tangy but not overwhelming.  I like the individual packages, because I actually stop eating when I finish a bag.<br /><br />In each bag there are about 18 large chips, 3 grams of fat (not bad!), 100 calories, 15 g of carbohydrates, 140 mg of salt, and no cholesterol.  They are vegan friendly, parve (no meat or dairy), and gluten free.<br /><br />The package says they are healthier because they are not fried and they are tastier because they are not baked.  They use heat and pressure to "pop" the potatoes into light and airy (my description) chips.<br /><br />Finally, these packages have a "use by" date of nearly a year, much longer than regular chips.

review/summary: Love them, BUT NOT ALL FLAVORS
review/text: We really love Popchips or at least we love the BBQ and the Orginal. Good and crunchy without all the fat and calories. The single serve bags are really great. Costco really has the best price, when they are available there. Since we are a big fan of Jalapeno, we went ahead and ordered them here at Amazon,even though the price was high, and we regret that purchase, the Jalapeno flavor is just wrong. Awful would be the right description. We also tried the Cheddar and that on also failed badly for us. So, we will stick to the BBQ and the Orginals.

review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: I recently discovered Popchips and their greatness. So I have been trying them out flavor by flavor. The Chili Lime has is now my favorite. It had previously been the Salt & Pepper. It is def not too spicy, so don't let that scare you. If anything the lime is the highest note of flavor. If you already like Popchips, this is a new great flavor to try. If you have never tried them, then this is a great flavor to start with.

review/summary: I still like potato chips, but these are surprisingly delicious! Airy! Crispy!
review/text: These Popchips are delicious! The best thing I like about them is that they're crunchy and airy with a perfect blend of chili and lime flavoring. I love the boldness of the chili and tartness of the lime! Each chip appears to me like two thin potato chips sealed together with air inside! That might be a bit fanciful, but that's how it feels when I bite into one. They satisfy my taste buds and I get an extra jolt from the airiness and crunchiness.<br /><br />What else can I say, except: Yum! Yum! And, oh, yes, with all-natural ingredients and only 100 calories for the entire bag, my Dr. approves them too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 22, 2012<br />Author of "Dream Reachers" series of books (with Chase Von)

review/text: These are little airy and delicious nuggets of goodness...except of course, they aren't nuggets, lol. Really though, these chips are nice and crunchy while also being light and airy. The salt and vinegar flavor is just right...not too strong, but never lacking. Actually, my only real complaint is that i find it difficult to stop eating them. However, that is simply my cross to bear.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Great crispy crunch and flavor
review/text: My family is addicted to crispy, salty snacks and I've tried a few different kinds of chips trying to find a healthier alternative to the junk food they all love.<br /><br />I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DZIL24">Terra Krinkle Cut Sweet Potato Sea Salt</a> chips for their high level of vitamin A. But they are also high fat, and the texture and flavor don't appeal to my daughter.<br /><br />These chips don't have any vitamin A according the to the label, but they are low calorie, low fat and low sodium. The texture and flavor are a definite hit with everyone in my family, even my very picky daughter.<br /><br />The sweet potato chips aren't too sweet or too salty and they don't feel greasy at all. They are really crisp. The flavor is a little bland, but it also doesn't have the aftertaste that some vegetable chips can have.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the chips is rice flour, not sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I'd like these better if they had more going for them nutritionally. The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon. I think they would be a wonderful topping for casseroles if they stay crispy enough.

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these "chips" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's "good" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.

review/text: I really liked these.  Great snack for someone watching their fat and or calorie intake.  Light, crunchy and full of flavor.  They don't taste like a traditional chip they seem infused with air or something.  The biggest problem for me would be if I bought the large bag I would be too tempted to eat way more than a serving.  So these single sized bags are ideal.<br /><br />Also should mention that the sweet potato variety that I tried do not contain any dairy which is a necessity for me and I'm sure others have similar issues.

review/text: After reading several reviews from people apparently on diets I now understand the high star rating because if you can't have the real thing something like this passes for good. These are bland, have a weird texture and aren't very good. I will be sending these to work with my husband so he can give them away. I ate a few from my first and only bag before throwing them in the pantry. They are low in calories and low in taste. Pass.

review/summary: Chili Lime Flavor - Review
review/text: In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list.

review/summary: Keep Popping!
review/text: The crisp texture of these PopChips is very appealing.  The chips also stayed whole in the bag, which is a big plus.  They  have a nice sweet potato flavor, with a light hint of salt.  Best of all, no greasy fingers!  I like that they are a healthy alternative to other chips or crackers.  The information on the bag well represents the taste of the chips.  I think that children would like these and they would certainly be a healthy alternative to other chips.  They are also gluten free...which seems to be a growing trend in foods today.  Overall, I would definitively buy these chips again and look forward to trying other flavors of Popchips.

review/summary: Satisfies a sweet potato tooth
review/text: Sweet potatoes are among my favorite vegetables, and I especially adore sweet potato chips. So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth.

review/summary: A healthier snack
review/text: We got the sweet potato flavor through the Vine program.  I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake "healthier" for "healthy."  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those "truth in advertising" points that annoys me so I mention it.

review/summary: Fabulous Taste - can't eat just one but small warning
review/text: These are absolutely delicious and irresistable. The taste is perfect - not heavy or overdone. It actually kind of sneaks up on you before you realize you've just finished the bag.<br /><br />They seem to melt in your mouth even as you are chewing them as opposed to some brands that make you feel like Mr. Ed (the horse). Yes,there is some salt, but it's not like someone just dumped a container of the stuff on them. This time it enhances the chip.<br /><br />Everything in them is terrific except for the inclusion of maltodextrin about 2/3 down the ingredient list. It can have a kind of laxative effect on a lot of people and I just thought you should know it's in there.<br /><br />Other than that - there is nothing about this product that would detract me from buying it for parties, picnics, events, or just enjoying by myself.<br /><br />Seriously, they are that good.

review/text: Advertised as an all natural, gluten free,healthier snack, we tried the BBQ & Sour Cream & Onion flavors.  We have a slight preference for the BBQ over the Sour Cream & Onion because the BBQ has a little more flavor.

For flavor; however, we prefer Veggie Chips.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041BSZGA">Sensible Portions Veggie Snacks Variety - 24 Bags</a> (especially the Rosemary flavored straws).

review/text: I didn't realize I was getting 20 packets of these chips but I was happy to see them when they arrived.  I love anything sweet potato so I opened the box eagerly and started chowing down.  They are delicious!  My only concern is that I don't really like the texture of anything "popped" but because the flavor is delicious I can overlook that.  These chips would work perfectly with many diet plans.  They are very crispy and although you won't confuse them with "real" chips they will satisfy that urge for something crunchy.  I'm going to buy them in several other flavors to keep on hand.

review/summary: Once again, America's food scientists bring us a new snack!
review/text: POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO is a crunchy potato chip, that is not your grandfather's potato chip.  First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.  I have no negative comments about the POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO product.

review/summary: Taste more like "Tomato and Basil" than "Chili and Lime"
review/text: NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're "probably" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a "tomato" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like "Tomato and Basil" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.

Good but make for stinky breath<br />Salt & Pepper - Good<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - If you like Vinegar you might like these but I wasn't as big of a fan of them as I expected<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Hands down the BEST flavor

review/text: I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.

review/summary: My Favorite Go-To Snack
review/text: When PopChips were really hard to find, I was ordering them by the case from Amazon on a regular basis.  The price was always great and these really are my go-to snack.  They are always fresh and delicious from Amazon.<br /><br />I definitely prefer Original over barbecue and sour cream & onion.  I haven't tried other flavors, but Original works just fine for me because I use it for various dips and will even use dry seasonings on them if I'm in the mood.<br /><br />I don't know anybody that I've offered some of these to who didn't want a bag of their own!  Highly recommended.

review/summary: A healthy alternative
review/text: These are a much healthy alternative to most chips and they taste great.  They have a great crunch and flavor and don't have that bad after taste that most baked chips have.  My only regret is that I didn't order more when they were on sale there all gone now but even at regular price are worth it.

review/summary: Nothing Better on Grilled Chicken
review/text: For a really simple seasoning on chicken that you are going to toss on the grill, this is it. Dry the chicken, shake this on and grill over medium coals and you have heaven.<br /><br />A little pepper bite coupled with the other flavors is fantastic and takes me back to a road trip where a bunch of us from school spent 6 weeks going cross country in a VW buss. We were living cheap and camping most nights (even in a cemetary once) and when Dave Stebbins grilled up chicken with this stuff, we were in heaven.<br /><br />A problem is that at the local Safeway, it runs $6 a bottle. Here it is barely $4 which is a real deal.<br /><br />No salt added too and it is gluten free (LOL)

review/text: Since I am not the one who eats this I can't vouch for the taste......however the dog seems to love it. One thing we as dog owners like about this food is that it cut down the gas our schnauzer had. We switched from another food which really made the dog gassy. That one simple thing alone makes this food awesome!!!!  Amazon has this for about 10 bucks lower than pet smart so it makes it a good deal.

review/summary: Great food for a picky eater or those with digestive issues!
review/text: Our Himalayan cat is an extremely picky eater.  To add to this she has intestinal trouble with many foods (diarrhea, vomiting).  We only feed her quality foods with no grains or fillers, and this narrows our selection down quite a bit, knocking out most grocery store brands.<br /><br />We initially tried Wellness and apparently it was too rich for her with all the additional unnecessary ingredients (squash, zucchini etc?)  Then we tried the Natural Balance DUCK and pea, and she hated the taste and texture, which was extremely mushy.  We then put her on this Venison flavor, and she absolutely loves it and the more meaty texture.  She is enthusiastic every time she eats.  She loves the dry as well.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this food to anyone, especially those who have a cat with a sensitive digestive system.  Not only is it a healthy grain free, artificial/dye free food, but it is also a limited ingredient food, meaning pets with food allergies or bowel problems are more likely to tolerate it.  And it's very reasonably priced!

review/summary: High quality, flavorful tea.
review/text: Two Leaves and a Bud Organic Earl Grey tea is simply delicious.  Each box comes with one hundred mesh bags of whole tea, not the dust and debris you'll find in cheaper brands.  The tea itself is flavorful and delicious, with none of the aftertaste of commercial brands.  As a single person, I hesitated to purchase so many tea bags at once.  However, it is definitely worth the investment, as the tea comes in sealed individual plastic bags and tastes superior to tea from Starbucks or Lipton.  The tea has a delicate but full flavor, and NO sugar is necessary to make the tea delicious.  In addition to making hot tea, you can also use the bags to make incredible iced tea.  Simply make the tea at double strength and poor over ice.  Again, no sugar is needed - making this tea a good beverage for those of us watching their sugar intake.

review/summary: They changed the recipe!
review/text: I bought a box of this tea a few months ago, and it was amazing, best Earl Grey I have ever had.<br /><br />I decided to order a package of 6 boxes, and the tea I got was completely different. Different packaging, different baggies, shorter string, and most importantly of all TERRIBLE TEA. I cannot even drink it, it is so BAD. It doesn't even taste like earl grey, but cheap Lipton tea. There are no words to explain my utter disappointment. I would give it zero stars, if I could.<br /><br />UPDATE...<br />I called Two Leaves and a Bud to ask why this tea was so different, and they admitted that they have changed not only their tea source, but also their production/packaging facility. So the new tea is indeed a completely different product (these changes span all packaging types: single boxes, bags, 100 count, and 6-box count).<br /><br />Their customer service however, is SUPERB. They offered to replace the 6 boxes with any of their other products. I chose loose-leaf Decaf Earl Grey (which is almost as delicious as the pre-change Earl Grey). I didn't even need to ship the 6 boxes back - they told me to keep it, give it away, whatever. What an outstanding company!

While the packaging on the individual bags looks very similar, this is not the same tea; it  the worst tea I have ever had, with a strong unpleasant taste and does not taste like Earl Grey.

review/summary: I adore this enchilada sauce
review/text: Mexican is one of my favorite foods and smothering a bean burrito with red sauce and onions is one of my quick, stand-by dinner options. With such a simple meal, it is imperative to have fresh and tasty ingredients. I've tried many red sauces and some were quite good, but this one is excellent.<br /><br />Frontera makes two types of red sauce. One is vegetarian and the other has chicken.  My husband is a huge fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTKVDE">Frontera Foods Inc. Sauce, Enchilada, Clasc Red, 16-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>.  That product has chicken components.  My husband raved about the sauce.  As a vegetarian, I could not eat it so I was excited to find the 8 ounce pouches of sauce that are vegetarian.<br /><br />I find this product to have a rich tomato taste.  The sauce spreads easily and is not thin or tomato paste thick. The pouches, however, are relatively small.  I can cover about five burritos that are wrapped in six inch tortillas with a thin layer of sauce.  Two pouches are really optimal for a dish that has five - eight burritos.<br /><br />I've purchased these eight ounce pouches off Amazon but also purchase them from my local co-op for about 2.75.  If interested in a single package and your grocery store does not carry this item, try iherb.com.  If interested in iherb, you can use my code LEK375 for a discount.<br /><br />Made in the United States.

review/summary: Dinner in 20 minutes
review/text: I saw this product today at the store. I'm a good cook, for sure,  but there are days I want to get dinner ready in thirty minutes tops. This product assists that goal. The sauce was a very credible enchilada sauce. Surprisingly good.  It calls for a package per 4 enchiladas.(using corn tortillas) I WISH I'd bought a grocery roasted chicken and filled them with both that and that cheese from a bag. But we are trying to encourage vegetarianism, so that's ok. At least as much as we can we are eating meatless. It was a very rich sauce, dark. Not sweet. Not hot or very spicy. You could spice it. We added hot sauce after for those that want to crash and burn.  It baked 15 minutes and everyone ate it up. Really good for a fast alternative when sauce making and cooking isn't an option-say in putting together a fast dinner or lunch if someone stops in or you just prefer conversation, and snuggling to grinding away on the oven. I also made Spanish rice and a salad and fruit and decided to go online where this was cheaper and order some for future cooking. Give it a try. I'm ordering the green sauce too and this will go into the rotation for my fixing dinner while working.

review/summary: Excellent dog treats - our dogs adore them
review/text: Our dogs ABSOLUTELY LOVE these treats; all three flavors (apple, carrot, blueberry). They are an excellent size for training as well (not too large), and in addition to being made with healthier ingredients, they are very low in sodium and therefore much kinder to canine kidneys than the many low-quality super-salty treats on the market.<br /><br />Humans will be tempted to try tasting these treats too, as they smell as absolutely wonderful and tasty as human cookies - although my daughter tells me they taste somewhat blander to her than the delicious smell would suggest. Our dogs, however, for whom their sense of smell is most important, find them utterly delicious - and they are the ultimate critics whose taste-opinion matters.<br /><br />The packaging is also easy to open and re-seal. We highly recommend this brand of dog treats.

review/text: If I think these treats smell amazing, I wonder what my dogs think of the smell! These purple triangle-ish treats are perfect for adding to my variety treat jars. My dogs seem more interested in coming when called when there is the chance of something new and delicious. I have a rotation of about 8 different treat types, and these have moved up the list of must-haves. They smell so good, I've tried them - but the smell is more potent than the taste (which is bland). Bland is what I want in a training treat! I can't say these last long enough in my dogs' mouths to do any real plaque-removal work, but I know they aren't contributing to gunky plaque. This is also a good treat to practice throwing/catching treats because they can see the treat. Find them on sale and stock up! A 10-oz bag goes fast with two big dogs and a generous owner.

That said, they could improve this product by using certified organic poultry fat and some sort of organic substitute for the "chicken meal", too.  I don't like the thought of the probable factory-farmed ingredients as far as those two things but, other than that, the ingredients are very wholesome and, like I said, I greatly appreciate that this is a wheat-free, corn-free product.  If you are looking for a relatively high-quality, long-lasting, fabulous-smelling training treat, this is it!

review/summary: kitty food
review/text: I bought this for my dog, she liked it, but not as much as my cats. They opened the bag and began feeding themselves. They are two feral cats named caesar and marc anthony. They actually knock on the door. so I will continue order it for both of them.

review/summary: Best soda ever made :)
review/text: Being from Michigan, I grew up drinking Squirt.  It wasn't until I married and moved out of state that I realized this soda is rarely seen in stores outside of Michigan, Illinois and Ohio.  It's disappointing as this has to be one of the most refreshing, clean tasting sodas out there.  I would have to say the closest other brand is Fresca, though Fresca has an overly sweet flavor in comparison.  Squirt soda is really clean and crisp with the definite tart of grapefruit, perfect for a summer BBQ.  It's also a great for mixed drinks. Even the diet version is really good as there isn't much flavor difference from that of the full calorie version.  Whenever we have friends or family visit from home we always have them bring us a few cases.

review/summary: I Love Squirt
review/text: When I was a little kid I used to go down to the corner store and buy a bottle of Squirt for a nickel. Very tasty and refreshing. I can't imagine why it's no longer widely distributed nor is it properly promoted. I'm glad it's available thru Amazon but the shipping fee is  more than twice the soda cost. Furthermore one of the cans in my box was deformed and leaked. The shipment was via UPS ground and it seemed to be well packed with no apparent damage to the package. So the five star rating is for being able to enjoy the taste of Squirt once again. Incidently, I have subsequently introduced Squirt to several people who just loved it!

review/summary: You'd have to be desperate
review/text: A person would have to be very desperate to pay $25 for 2 twelve-packs of soda. A twelve pack in the store can be had for as low as $2.50 on sale, $4 worst-case. What's more, adding $45 for shipping is gouging in the worst way. If Squirt isn't available locally, you're better off buying some on vacation and taking it back on the plane with you.
