review/summary: Pretty bland
review/text: There is nothing offensive about this tea, but there isn't really anything to commend it either.  With all the herbs, I was really looking forward to tasting what I thought would be a fabulous hot tea and it turned out to be only "all right".<br /><br />I enjoy many of this company's red teas (rooibos blends) and usually find teas with this list of ingredients to be very pleasing but the best word I can us to  describe it is bland.  Not much flavor which means I drank the small pot I made without pouring it out, but I won't be making it any more.

review/text: VERY different from swiss miss / nestle hot chocolate mixes.  I wouldn't say it's universally better, just different.  Don't think I could replace morning coffee with this, so the search continues.<br /><br />Not a fan of the hazelnut, even though I really like hazelnut coffee.<br />Mocha is very rich, not crazy about it but it's okay<br />Double chocolate's definitely the best.

review/summary: Great as a gift or for yourself
review/text: This is a great item for one person, or could be taken apart and given to friends individually. Packaged in a well made manner, the giftset would be good considersation or addition the gift basket for a house warming or christmas gift. the items are shipped as an entire package, and the containers are individually sealed, which makes it possible to be taken out of the box and given as individual containers, if you have the option of repackaging the items as individuals. The tastes of the hot chocolate like all Ghiradelli Premiums require a good hot glass of milk, as mixing with pure hot water does not taste as good. I do suggest considering Nestle if you were just thinking of boiling hot water. The hazelnut mix is also great for putting into a mix of smoothy with strawberries and bananas, so the mix itself is great for dual purposes.<br /><br />Overall: B+

review/summary: Gritty, and watery, way to sweet
review/text: This product does have a much better chocolate flavor than many other mixes on the market, but it lacks the smooth creaminess of even the cheapest mix packets.  Admittedly I have made my hot chocolate primarily with water rather than milk because I usually have a cup midday at work and milk isn't available, but even Swiss Miss mixed with water has a nice creamy feel.  Even at home with milk I am dissatisfied with this product due to the gritty consistency that I cannot seem to overcome, and the excessive sweetness that I find so unpleasant that I can't finish a whole cup.  Finally gave up on the product and donated to the office coffee club.  My search for a reasonably good mix continues.  Any suggestions appreciated.

review/text: It is good hot coco but its not like you have had it in the store. It is more expensive to make if you use water for hot cocoa because you have to use milk to get the creamy taste with this product. But the value of the three flavors are nice so you don't waste your money on a flavor you don't like.

review/summary: High quality cat food that my cats love!
review/text: I have three cats, one of which has IBS/digestive issues.  My vets recommended that I switch him to a food with the fewest ingredients as possible and that has an unusual protein (like lamb or venison).  I can get both of those with Ziwipeak!  And all three of my cats love it, which was a real surprise to me.  It took some getting used to since the jerky-style pellets are very different from feeding regular dry food.  But my cats adapted relatively quickly.  All three seem to be thriving on it.  I'm very happy to have found this food.

review/summary: KiwiPeak Lamb
review/text: I have two very picky cats. One has serious food allergy issues, so I've been trying out new foods. My cat with allergies LOVES this food, and it fortunately does not make him sick. The other cat, unfortunately will barely touch this food. He seems to like the smell, but he's really a dry crunchy food addict. The texture of this food is a bit odd. It comes in small flat squares that are dry, but a bit more like jerky than normal dry cat food (not tough like jerky, that's just the closest thing I can compare it to. I suppose you could even compare it to a chopped fruit roll up, made with meat puree instead of fruit). This food wasn't a complete winner for us, but it works for one cat at least.

review/text: After receiving the package I was hoping my three cats would eat it and get healthier. Well none of them would even look at it. Not even hungry stray cats that live outside of my house would even touch it. For the fairness of all consumers that are interested in this product. I will write out the whole sentence that appears on the back of the package and what has been crossed out. "Look for Ziwipeak  'Cuisine' in convenient pouches and easy-tab cans and Ziwipeak treats and supplements at leading natural pet stocklists. The Ziwkpeak 'Cuisine' range is produced in NZMAF-licensed 'PET FOOD' factory &lt;cross out begins> using ingredients derived from animals that have been passed as fit for human consumption in their raw state. &lt;Cross out ends>" I do not care whatever excuse Ziwipeak may present but this non-human grade food is not what I am willing to spend extra money for health of my cats. I have wasted money and I have no way of returning it.

It is certified Kosher by KOF-K and is organically grown in New England. Grade B maple syrup is excellent for pouring on waffles or pancakes and is also tasty added to baked goods.

About two weeks later I got an email from Nutricity stating that their policy is no refunds on grocery items, and if I wanted the product back I would have to pay for shipping back to me. That's fine if that's their policy, but it was not clearly stated, and if that is their policy, I should not have been able to print a return authorization from the Amazon website.

review/summary: See how it stacks up against the others
review/text: This is good syrup and my 2nd favorite.  It has a medium sweetness when compared with the other 2 that I've tried.  I typically don't like things very sweet.  I used 3 syrups listed below for my Master Cleanse.  They are all good quality and I'd recommend any of them.  You probably will want 1 jug for every 5 days of a cleanse.  It is possible that you'll need more.  I'm not an expert to comment on darkness or many other factors.  Here's my brief breakdown:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - The sweetest of the 3 for sure.  It is also probably the thickest but still runny.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  When I put this in my lemonade for the Master Cleanse, it makes the lemonade sweeter than how I like it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ENHSC8">NOW Foods Maple Syrup Grade B Organic, 32 ounce</a> - Is less sweet when compared to Coombs but a little sweeter than Family Heritage.  Runnier than Coombs but these syrups are all a little runnier than grocery syrups.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  It provided the right amount of sweetness for the Master Cleanse specifications for a drink.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248E980">Family Heritage Organic Vermont Maple Syrup, Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - Good quality and tastes sweet but definitely not as sweet as the other 2.  Didn't get the calorie info before throwing the bottle away but I'm figuring it's the same as the other 2.  I usually put an extra 1/2 a tbsp in my master cleanse lemonade to get it a little sweeter and curb the hunger.

review/summary: So much better than Grade A!
review/text: I'm from Maine and I have to tell you that I would never buy grade A maple syrup. If I'm going to use maple syrup, I want that rich, distinctive taste, not something that's barely different than white sugar. That's actually a good comparison - grade A is to grade B as white is to brown sugar. I know we're all used to thinking of "grade A" as meaning of superior quality, but that's not how it works with this. It is referring to the level of filtering/processing the sap goes through. If you want generic sweetness, go grade A. For everything else, grade B. This is a trusted brand of organic syrup with a great flavor. By the way, for baking and real maple syrup afficionados, there is also a grade C (even darker)!

review/text: If you are thinking of doing the Master Cleanse, this is the product you are looking for.  It is reasonably priced, high quality and exactly fits all the specifications they recommend.  One note, if you are going to do the full 10 days you will either need 2 or an additional 32 oz. I personally liked it as a table syrup as well.  It's the "stout" of maple syrups.

review/text: I started using this product for the Master Cleanse (lemonade diet). I have tried other brands but found this one to be the best.  I highley recommend it.  The only problem I have found is in the shipping sometimes the plastic cap gets broken even though they pack it well the delivery people most likely have dropped it at some point.  Thats the way it goes sometimes.  Since the jug is sealed it's still usable.

My husband has been wanting pancakes just so he can eat the syrup! I've used it for a Master Cleanse and don't know if it's the quality of the syrup or what, but have had better success with detoxing using this than a Grade A or other brand of Grade B (this is my 3rd MC).  I look forward to using this for breakfast and baking, I will reorder again and recommend to friends and family! It would make a great gift in a gourmet gift basket!

review/text: I have used real maple syrup for years.  When my kids were small I used the standard stuff until I started becoming a label reader, then I could not in good conscience continue to serve a product that amounted to a liquid chemical concoction.  I recently discovered grade B syrup, which has a stronger, more molassas kind of flavor.  Besides the obvious pancakes and french toast, I also use it on oatmeal and in baked goods.  Will continue to purchase.

review/summary: Definition of NON-GE for this product, from Now Foods. I have not used this item, am just giving definition.
review/text: Non-GE - "GE" stands for genetic engineering and is also referred to as GMO (genetically modified organism). Genetic engineering of food products uses gene splicing to overcome natural boundaries that would otherwise prohibit the creation of a product. Genes from different species can be combined to create a hardier product resistant to certain exogenous factors. As an example, you might be able to add fish genes to corn to make it resistant to pesticides. Although there may be "instant gratification" from such benefits as better taste, longer shelf life, and greater yield, serious concerns exist about the long-term ramifications of using these types of products and ingredients. Until more research backing the safety of GE products is available, we'll continue to make every effort to use only non-GE ingredients and products

review/summary: Product is good, but bottle arrived damaged.
review/text: It's grade-B maple syrup. I used it for some Christmas recipes. It was sticky and smelled and tasted of maple, and was (presumably) not made out of some unknown substance that fell to earth, possibly from space. I trust that a health-food company would sell the genuine article so advertised. Perhaps naive of me, but I was willing to take that leap of faith this time.<br /><br />Only gripe: the blue cap arrived broken. There was a silvery plastic seal across the top, much like you would find on a bottle of salad dressing, so the syrup stayed in place. I would not, however, recommend using the syrup as salad dressing. Unless you're into that kind of thing. Not that there's anything wrong with that. You freak.

review/summary: Different! And not in a good way!
review/text: If you are used to eating the pink colored (artificial) ginger sushi slices, you will be disappointed with this product, just like I was. The reason I tried it was the fact that they do not add artificial colorants to it. Nor do they add any sugar. But!!! They add tons of salt! It is so salty, I can't eat it at all. I put it into a big bucket of water, to let the salt leak out. So far, after 5 rinses, it is getting milder. But, the salt takes away from the natural gingery taste. Why oh why did they have to do that? If I have to choose between a vinegar-sugar mix or a vinegar-salt mix, I will pick the sugar anytime, when it comes to pickled ginger. By the way, the saltwater-vinegar blend makes up 10 % of the product weight indicated (I drained and measured it). I now replaced it with a sherry vinegar plus some sugar. I'll let it sit for some days in the fridge and see if it becomes edible. In conclusion, this was not a great buy, especially when adding the cost of the bottle of vinegar (5.90) and the sugar, and the time to work it up.<br />Unless you like it extremely salty, in which case, you'll be really happy!<br />One more thing: what do you do with all that ginger in a plastic pouch, once you open it? This is terrible packaging! How about a jar with a screwcap? That would definitely help with storage! (I had to find myself a glass jar to put it into.)

review/summary: Very good value, good quality
review/text: This pickled ginger as good as more expensive, smaller packages. A good example is Eden Ginger, Pickled with Shiso Leaves, 2.1-Ounce Container (Pack of 6), which sells on Amazon for $29.17. Buy this big bag instead and pay about $5 less for 3 times more product!<br /><br />Have one large or several smaller storage container(s) at hand and transferring the contents out of the bag as soon as it's opened. Keep it all in the fridge. The ginger tends to loose some of it's bright pink color when exposed to air. Keeps well, even if the fades color, is not spoiled.<br /><br />Makes a great, homemade salad dressing ingredient. Add a tablespoon or two of the pickled ginger, 1 or 2 peeled cloves of garlic, 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar and 2 tablespoons of a nice olive oil to a blender. Puree it until it's emulsified and pour over your fresh greens.

review/summary: So tasty, so dangerous
review/text: I have a few public vices (like being a gummy bear addict) and a famine or binge eating approach when it comes to certain sweets (like being a gummy bear addict).  I'm also slightly allergic to corn (and of course all its fun by-products), which makes my above issues something of a challenge.  IF I get gummy bears (usually as part of a mall window-shopping driveby), I eat them all, very quickly, which leads to all kinds of post-glut-madness remorse and belly aches.  So I usually dodge these tasty Trojan Horse morsels until enough time has passed for me to forget the last crazed episode.<br /><br />Then I discovered something comparable but w/out corn syrup in our local health food store, tried them, and if not for the astronomical pricing (I think the 2 oz package works out to $75 per pound) I could happily tease if not satisfy the craving.  Soon after, I uncovered Surf Sweets' bulk option on Amazon.  Fantastic product, very tasty, surprisingly more economical than the typical mall offering, and the quality and sheer overwhelming mass of 10 lbs of bears means I can satisfy my cravings and curry favor doling them out at family gatherings.<br /><br />Minor downsides - only 3 flavors (with only orange, lemon, & cherry it's harder to have creative bear wars on the kitchen table or to use them as surrogates in 4 person boardgames - *note: going "tops vs. bottoms" is a poor substitute with a semi-gelatinous candy) and there's no sizing in-between "measly" and "omg-hope-I-get-to-the-box-before-anyone-sees-it" (i.e. it's the rather pricey 2.75 oz packages or the princely but gluttonous if you're not a candy store 10 lbs box).  Unlike one prior poster here, the mostly editorial "we" here demolished these in less than a month (like I said, I may have a problem), so I recommend putting these into a candy dispenser that requires money for each dosage.  All in all, a great price and a great product (if you have self-control).

review/summary: Guilt-free gummy bears
review/text: What a great alternative to the other gummy products that my children beg for!  Although moderation in all things is best, I now have a healthy choice I can keep on my shelf - and gluten-free to boot!  Even mom can snitch a few on those occasions when the sweet tooth is demanding a fix. &lt;g>  Additionally, this is the lowest price/best deal that I've found to date.  Nearly half the cost of what I've paid at other sites.

review/text: It took over 6 months for my family, friends and I to do it, but we demolished this 10lb bag of gummy bears.  I originally bought them for Halloween, assuming that I'd be getting 10lbs worth of serving-size bags of bears.  Luckily for me, though, I had some empty mason jars laying around.<br /><br />What better gift for a friend or relative than a jar of gummy bears?

review/summary: Excellent choice for the lactose intolerant
review/text: I have been using Silk Soymilk products for years now.  After a long stretch of not being able to consume any dairy, I can finally add calcium and vitamin D to my diet without those horribly chalky pills.<br /><br />I admit to being confused by the only other review on here - it's not yougurt - it's soymilk - as in milk.<br /><br />I have sucessfully used this as a replacement in all but one recipe - you cannot make instant pudding with soymilk.  You can however make just about everything else, from Pancakes, French Toast, cakes, mashed potatoes, anything but pudding.<br /><br />True it doesn't taste EXACTLY like milk - but I've never cared for milk anyway.  My family highly recommends the chocolate and very vanilla as well.<br /><br />Note - Very Vanilla does NOT taste okay when used to make mac and cheese - it's just weird.

review/summary: Best Soy Milk
review/text: I use two cartons a week and love it.  It's creamier than other brands I've tried making it excellent for coffee and tea.  Can't say enough good about this product, it's delicious and it allows me to keep my dairy intake to a minimum.  I think the addition of a little cane sugar is warranted since cow's milk and cream are sweet (there is plenty of naturally occurring sugar in dairy foods) so for Silk to satisfy most people as a replacement for dairy it needs to be a tiny bit sweet.  I like the vanilla too, but I prefer the original for taste and for versatility (does not add a vanilla taste to recipes or scrambled eggs etc).  Calories are the same in both versions.

review/text: Silk is usually absolutely delicious. But it contains cane juice --- which translates to sugar. Besides for which, the plain flavor doesn't taste nearly as good as the others. Between the unrefined, organic, naturally milled, all that good stuff SUGAR and the not great taste, my take on this kind of Silk is especially "Thanks, but no thanks."

review/summary: Their motto: If it doesn't suck it isn't Silk!
review/text: I can't comment on the other flavors of Silk soy "milk" but this flavor is the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted!  To me it's truly a sin to waste food and I've been know to eat or drink things that were merely abhorrent rather than throw them out, but after one swallow of this liquid refuse I poured the rest of it down the sink.  Because my wife is lactose intolerant I foolishly thought the Silk company could make passable "yogurt" since it had added flavors, but no, the predominant flavor was some vague aftertaste that seemed somehow off, as if they used motor oil as an ingredient.  My wife experienced it too, so it isn't just me.  Funny that O'Soy tastes just like regular yogurt and has no aftertaste.  For a delicious milk substitute, try Rice Dream.  The original tastes just like milk while the vanilla tastes just like ice cream!  As a bonus, neither O'Soy nor Rice Dream have sanctimonious commercials filled with sanctimonious actors/athletes who have obviously either never tried a Silk product or they were paid very big bucks to mislead the naive and trusting populous.

review/text: Even though I am a 60s lady I was not a fan of granola, well until now.  This is absolutely the best tasting and most satisfying granola I have ever tasted.  I ordered it for my sister too and she wants more. I advise that if you are taking a trip this is a great car, plan or boat snack.  Keep it in your house for all times when you need some quality nourishment. The flavors are independant of each other so the grains, the fruit and the spices are not just one taste, but three.  I am going to order some more right now!

review/text: Someone wrote it before, but this truly is better then regular "golden" honey. Much sweeter and a fuller flavor. It's more opaque and there's bits of the honey comb in with it, which gives it a slightly grainier texture which I actually prefer over regular honey. I give it a 10 out of 10. Excellent value, especially given that it comes from Michigan and not South America. Thanks for an excellent product, we will be back for more.

However, to be honest I do not smell much chemical smell from normal Duraflame logs.  The cost for these logs I do not believe to be worth it in the end...they burn for a little over 2 hours and they cost double of what 4 hour logs cost at Walmart.  I am as environmentally conscious as a lot of folks but this seems over the top.
