review/summary: this water is pure fake and fraud
review/text: i have used this water for more than 6 years and i am disappointed.  and  I want to call myself a jackass!  i have been tricked to believing this was some natural spring water with some potent silica or other minerals.  but it doesn't.  according to REAL USA government WATER test's and private non-profit tests of both fiji and evian water and also dozens of other bottled water; it showed both are worse than tap water and no more different than walmart water and other .50 cent harmful bottle water.<br /><br />moreover, these plastic bottles are not even BISPHENOL-A and PHTHALATE free.  the water in FIJI and EVIAN are more polluted than the water that comes from our USA only facets!  That's because there are US government mandated sanitary, germ(UV lighting,etc) cleansing requirements for most USA water municipalities.<br /><br />fiji has one of the dirtiest scandal tricks by promoting to hollywood figures and then promoting a popular celebrity drinking that fiji water to the ignorant general public. And then, as you know, that popularity advertisement campaign goes as:  "MONKEY see MONKEY do mentality bandwagon personality!<br /><br />this FIJI and EVIAN water is fake and fraudulently labeled as natural spring water but is nothing more than chlorinated, unnatural water from sewage rivers that are polluted with toxic chemicals from some polluted pacific land! And if that!<br /><br />there is only one water, and true water and its made right here in the USA!  guess who?  it comes from a true geo-thermal underground natural spring water system in which the water is naturally super-heated(at temps of molten lava) and then cooled as it travels through a natural sedimentary detoxification process and then producing minerals like natural calcium and magnesium from the minerals rocks that it travels from the YOSEMITE mountains in california with no sodium contents!  NATURAL CALCIUM AND MAGNESIUM ARE HIGHLY ESSENTIALLY NEEDED MINERALS FOR THE HUMAN BODY AND HAS HEALING PROPERTIES AS WELL!<br /><br />And that real natural water is called Adobe spring water, aka:  NOAH'S WATER.<br /><br />there are some other mildly flavored water but the best is just the natural water and maybe the oxygenated water--which has a high content of oxygen in the water.<br /><br />This water has over 4 times the World Health Organization's minimum standard, having 110 mg of magnesium per liter. This is the ONLY water source ON EARTH that has this much magnesium, without also having harmful levels of sodium, etc. Also, the water has less particulates than perhaps any other state-licensed water source in California, with only .11 NT Units per liter. This means this water is the cleanest water in California.<br /><br />its the ONLY state-licensed water source in California that meets the UN's World Health Organization standard for magnesium content of having at least 25 mg of magnesium per liter, to prevent heart disease and stroke. See page 80 of the WHO book, CALCIUM AND MAGNESIUM IN DRINKING WATER, [...]

review/summary: Honestly the best spring water that exists.
review/text: Filtered/purified water is absolutely disgusting compared to this water; if you have never drank spring water before because "animals leave things behind in it" then you MUST try this water. Fiji comes from an Artesian aquifer. The water filters through volcanic rock and then sprays out of the ground like a fountain. This filtering process is what gives Fiji its unique flavor; there is no human way of replicating this taste and there never will be. The result is absolutely phenomenal.<br /><br />Keep in mind that Fiji is a very 'soft' water. That is, it has a very smooth texture to it and has more of a 'flavor' than most water. Purified water would be described as 'hard' because it doesn't have any flavor. You may or may not like this water; it all depends on what your taste buds think. I however have found that 90% of people LOVE this water when they try it.

review/summary: Tastes OK
review/text: Water is good if you're thirsty. Fiji certainly tasted softer, less minerals, less metallic than my tap water at home, but then so does other people's tap water. I was unable to definitively say whether I preferred the tap water or Fiji. 2 stars because in my opinion this is a very over-priced item marketed to the delusional obsessive. It may or may not be better or worse for health than the tap water, since they only list the "good" minerals that are in it...maybe they shouldn't list fluoride. My tap water is deliberately treated to be free of the most dangerous contaminants.<br /><br />Fiji implies (though they don't concretely claim) that this water comes from a CONFINED aquifer and that means it is not replenished by rainfall so there is none of the airborne pollution we have seen in the atmosphere over the last 150 years or so. Of course this means that it will run out, so I guess buy it while you still can! It must have been in the air and through the ground at some point though since that's how the water cycle works, so we must assume that dinosaurs or some organisms have pooped in it.

review/summary: Great deal on the best "odorless" and long-lasting bully sticks we've tried yet!
review/text: If you try to buy bully sticks at your standard pet store, they aren't cheap!  And if your dog loves them like mine does, that adds up pretty quickly.<br />That being said, these were a fantastic deal.  They are thicker than the ones we were buying at the pet store (we were getting pencil sized thickness bully sticks) - these are more like 2-3 pencil size thickness.  Given that I have a little yorkie puppy, these 12" sticks are humongo.  She enjoys them better when they are smaller and she can hold on to it.  So they are really tough to cut through (I'm weak...other reviewers have an easy time breaking them but I certainly don't!), but it's possible, especially after she's already chewed on it.<br />Plus they last much longer.  The pet store 12" one that we were getting for $8 a stick (but they were nice, they were pretty odorless too) - would last her a couple of hours in one night!  1/3 of one of these will last her a week!<br />And yes, they are almost odorless compared to other brands we have tried.  Granted if you stick your nose right where she is chewing, it's a little bit stinky, but not anywhere close to some of the other stinky brands out there!<br />BTW, we started to get these because Cesar Millan the Dog Whisperer recommended them in his book...he said they are better for your dog's digestive system than regular rawhides.<br />I will definitely continue to buy these, but the nice thing is that I don't have to buy it that often since they are longer lasting!<br /><br />In summary:<br />PROS:<br />-yorkie puppy LOVES them!<br />-great value<br />-most "odorless" we've found yet<br />-much longer lasting than other brands of bully sticks<br />-Dog Whisperer recommended - better for your dog's digestive system<br /><br />CONS:<br />-hard to break into smaller pieces if you're a weak, petite person like myself!

review/text: Why my dog loves these, I will never know.  They arrived in a timely manner but were not packed in a smell friendly bag.  When opened the envelope I was almost knocked over by the stench.  Plus, although they were very long and med thickness (not as thick as they suggest) he ate it in less than ten minutes.  I will probably get them again for him since his teeth are really sparkling.

review/summary: sometimes "odor free" and sometimes not!
review/text: First of all because of the nature of this product, I don't think its possible for them to be "odor free".  However I've ordered these from this seller several times.  The first two times they were great - nice thickness and smell wasn't too bad.  The third time I ordered, they smelled horrible - even worse than bully sticks that I've bought in the past that were not labeled odor free!<br /><br />I contacted the seller because I thought that perhaps they sent the wrong item (they weren't labeled) I was told that they probably smelled so bad due to being in an airtight package and once they aired out, the bad odor would lessen.  Wrong!  They stunk when they arrived, they stunk a week later after airing out, and they stink to high heaven when my pup is chewing on them.  But my pup loves them, so when they're on sale again, I'll probably order more and hope for the best...

review/summary: good, but not good enough
review/text: I recently adopted two rescue puppies and bought a few different chew toys that lasted only a half hour or so.  I was at a craft fair and bought a couple of bully sticks for [...] bucks each.  They were expensive but lasted almost a week.  So, I found these on amazon and immediately ordered them.  Yes, they are much cheaper than the ones I bought at the craft fair, but they only last about 2 days.  My puppies are now about 11 weeks old and medium size border collie mix.  I will be trying something else when these are gone.

review/summary: Great bully sticks!  My dog's favorite!
review/text: These were the first bully sticks I bought for my puppy and he LOVED them!<br /><br />I bought this brand because they come from free-range cattle and are baked vertically.  They also look and feel a lot fresher than bully sticks sold at my local PetCo.<br /><br />My puppy seems to prefer these bully sticks over the braided ones and the Merrick "Flossies."  They're his absolute favorite, and I can only surmise it's because of their flavor.<br /><br />My dog weighs 8 pounds and I soon realized that the 12" are way too big for him - one practically "stabbed" his throat as he was taking it to his crate!  So...if you have a small dog or puppy, you may want to buy the 6" or simply break the 12" bully stick in half (which is what I did).<br /><br />You can't go wrong with these.  And the price seems very reasonable.<br /><br />The seller, Happy Dog Place, is wonderful too.  I've already placed several orders through them and have been impressed by the fast and efficient service.  I even sent an inquiry via e-mail, which was answered by a human being a few hours later!  :-)

review/summary: I thought odor free wouldn't make a difference
review/text: I would only get this product if you really can't stand to smell them. regular bully sticks really only smell if you're smelling them or up close, like flowers. In order to make these odor free, they're covered with a plastic like coating and are not natural looking being all them same exactly size. My older pitt bull would not touch them even though bully sticks are her favorite. Luckily my puppy is teething and likes chewing just about anything so they didnt go to waste. After these were gone, I ordered a package of regular smelly sticks and both dogs are plowing through them. Dogs like stinky things!

review/text: From the reviews I read, I was expecting it to be a lot better. To start off though, It smells amazing - rich, cinnamony, and sweet. I was excited to take the first sip. However, I found the flavor to be disappointingly flat and watery - not the full bodied apple flavor that I read in the reviews. Instead, it was a generic tart flavor with a lot of great spice but not enough deepness in flavor to satisfy. The aftertaste was something akin to the aftertaste of sugarfree gum,  which was strange because the ingredients list real brown sugar. However, I added a dash of pure maple syrup and that improved the drink quite a bit. All in all, an okay drink. Just don't expect it to be as good as the real thing.

review/text: This is the best product for peppermint bark.  I used to crush candy canes when I couldn't find this product locally.  Then I realized that Amazon might have it and joila!  It produces a much prettier white chocolate peppermint bark than crushed candy canes.  The price is good and the shipping was super fast.  I don't know why the vendor offered it as free shipping at this price but I appreciated it.  I ordered it twice this Christmas, a total of 6 bags, and used them all.  One bag of peppermint crunch is stirred into two pounds of white chocolate.  Spread on parchment paper and in 15 minutes you have a delectable Christmas treat.  Really easy for the kids to help make.

Typically, all that needs to be done is to heat them in the microwave. Now, does this appeal to a lazy person? Oh, yes, and as you take your item to the register, there's a wide variety of drinks on display. Tonight, I had Chicken Alfredo (quite good) and a 16-ounce bottle of Hubert's Strawberry Lemonade to go with it. The lemonade came to about 120 calories for the whole bottle and it was sweetened (lightly) with cane sugar. The taste was light and pleasant. Nice drink!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

They are best when they are fresh and not hard. I tend to buy them and they are hard which is a dissappointment. I remember in the early 1990's there was a green apple version of these that was very good or maybe it was another brand. I liked those the best. Never seen them since. Anyone remember those?

review/text: If you've ever had a Red Vine from American Licorice Co., I would surmise that you're either indifferent to them or you just totally LOVE them. In my case, it's a lifelong love affair that constantly brings back fond memories of childhood. They have an indescribably unique flavor that just screams out more, more and more. The Brach's candy company had a version back in the 70's/80's, but I think it was either the same thing or a copy. I don't know for sure, but I do know that I am hooked forever. So is our 90 pound yellow lab. We limit him to 1 per day to keep his diet healthy, but MAN he can hear that Red Vines package rustle on the ground floor even when he's upstairs.

To be absolutely certain that this was the brand I bought, so that I didn't give a poor review to a brand that didn't deserve it, I wrote to the NANAK website today and received this reply to my query; "What are the ingredients?"<br /><br />Ingredients in NANAK paneer are:<br />MILK, MODIFIED MILK INGREDIENTS, CITRIC ACID, CALCIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, MODIFIED FOOD STARCH, GUAR GUM, XANTHAN GUM.<br /><br />What should paneer contain? Milk and lemon juice (or a small amount of vinegar). That's it folks. No "modified milk ingredients", no preservatives, no salts, no guar or xanthan gum.<br /><br />This product is a pathetic blend of trashy ingredients which yield a paneer that is tasteless and without much structure after frying... not to mention that it is anything but healthy.

review/summary: Contains Carrageenan
review/text: I ordered "Super Antioxidant" Naked treats last week.  Both my dogs love them.  It's the only treat I've found so far that our dog with part of his lower jaw removed, due to oral melanoma, can and will chew.  The problem is that I now see that the treats contain "carrageenan".  Now, I will have to find another dog (or trash can) to give the treats to.  I just ordered two more bags  today.  Although common in many foods, carrageenan is supposedly a carcinogen, per healthyeatingadvisor.com.  I've read from other sources that carrageenan can cause stomach problems.  If my dog had not already suffered from oral melanoma cancer, I might not be concerned.  But, I figure why take any chances.  Per notmilk.com, it's not the seaweed that's the problem, it's the processing to turn it into carrageenan.  Just like with things like Nutrasweet, etc.  Maybe this company uses a safe process.  I'll skip giving it to my dogs, until I know for sure.  Wow, shopping for dog food gets complicated!

review/text: I've tried everything with my 7 month old corgi/chi mix.  Normally he would eat half of a new brand's bone and then wouldn't touch another one again.  He just finished this bag a few days ago... he LOVES it.  And I love it too because the ingredients are way better than most of the dental chews out there.  No animal by products; no corn, wheat, or soy which can create horrible skin allergies... just really awesome and healthy ingredients.  I already bought two more bags and will definitely be a long term customer.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />It's been a while since my dog has first tried these.  He is a SUPER picky dog, but the minute he sees me pull out this bag, he goes crazy and starts to whine for them.  I can't believe he hasn't gotten bored of it yet.  I am very glad Amazon has lowered the price on these.

review/text: Teddy (lhasa apsso) is normally quite disdainful of chew treats. However, the day I brought these home he took it from me right away and ran off happily chewing. He will normally go through about one a day (small stick), I switch it up between these ones and the  "Gut Health," by the same brand. It ordinarily takes him a few hours to chew through, but he's not the biggest chewer. I'm very glad to find a treat he'll actually eat, he's glad to chew it, and lastly, I'm glad that it seems to be comprised of quality ingredients.

I call them brownies so she still has the same sort of word for her favorite treats and she sure loves these treats!  And they seem to have so many good ingredients in them, much better than what greenies have in them.  I will be buying these by the case if I can.  I just wish they came in a bigger box, a value pack or something, since I give one a day.

review/summary: My Dog Loves These Chew Sticks
review/text: My dog loves these Get Naked Super Antioxidant Dental Chew Sticks even though he is a bit finicky and tires easily of treats.  I have been giving my dog these treats for over a year and he still loves them.<br /><br />Every night when I get home, he barks in front of the container where these treats (and two other dental chew treats) are stored.  He loves all three of these treats, but seems to prefer the Get Naked Chew Sticks.  I put all three chews beside me on the couch under a pillow.  He comes by, pulls them out one at a time and runs away to chew them.  He routinely chooses the Get Naked Chew Sticks first.  Later, he comes back for the other two.<br /><br />From time to time, my dog does tire of the Get Naked Chew Sticks and so, I stop giving them to him for a while.  When he tires of the other dental chews, I return to the Get Naked Chew Sticks and find he love them again.

review/text: My miniature poodle loves these, so does my brother's terrier mix.  I don't give these treats every day, so I'm not sure how good they are with helping keep teeth clean.  But I like giving my dog these treats knowing they are natural.  He has never had any problems digesting them.

review/summary: Get Naked treat sticks
review/text: I have one small Chihuahua and one large Chihuahua mix. They just LOVE their Get Naked treats. My smaller puppy gets the small puppy stick broken in half. My larger girl gets a full small stick of either super antioxidant or tummy control. These are great treats to give when we leave the house to help with separation anxiety, gives them something to keep them occupied while we slip out the door. I am very mindful of my dog's weight and these give me piece of mind offering such a great treat w/ low calories. I just wish they were a bit cheaper! Prices on Amazon are $1.00+ less per bag than local store. I buy a bag or two every time I order from Amazon, helps me get the Free Shipping!

review/summary: I like them alot but too expensive....
review/text: I'm all about dental treats for my dog and i prefer these to greenies because i find the ingredients a liitle better but @ over 40 cents a treat that lasts 1 minute, i'll probably buy them maybe only a couple times a year. His other dental treats by Virbec, the CET chews and the hextra chew dental treats @ $9 for 30 treats is 30 cents per stick and that's usually my limit (teenie greenies are $0.22-25 each). Definitely a nice texture, not unhealthy and my dog very much likes them.<br /><br />Get Naked Treats:<br />Organic brown rice powder, rice powder, tapioca starch, gelatin, natural chicken flavor, oat fiber, carrageenan gum (natural seaweed extract), chia seed, parsley +(vitamins/minerals)<br /><br />Greenies:<br />Gelatin, wheat protein isolate, glycerin, soy protein isolate, sodium caseinate, natural poultry flavor, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, lecithin, vegetable oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols) +(vitamins/minerals)

review/summary: Variety pack provides a nice assortment to choose from.
review/text: Discovered this tea after my wife had it in a higher end restaurant.  She actually brought the wrapper home so that she could order some.  After a quick bit of on-line research discovered that Amazon sold the Mighty Leaf brand and at a very good price.  As for the price this is an expensive tea but in my opinion (and my wife's) well worth the price.  If you are used to getting 100 tea bags for $1 at the dollar store then you will be in for sticker shock but you will also be in for a taste shock.  This is what real quality tea tastes like.<br /><br />The tea comes in sewn nylon? bags. No chlorine bleached paper bags here.  The hang tag lists the name of the tea and the recommended brewing time. If you want to try Might Leaf tea for the first time I recommend this variety pack as it gives you seven different varieties to sample.  We have tried all the varieties and some we probably won't be buying individually and some we definitely will.

If you are a discriminating tea drinker, you will enjoy actually being able to see what makes up each cup of tea--leaves, flowers, bits of orange peel, etc. The silk bags really are beautiful--adds sophistication to the tea-drinking experience.<br /><br />I just discovered this tea during a hotel stay and went online to order more. This medley box is a great way to try it out, at a great price. I can make a small pot of tea (2-3 cups) from each bag.

review/summary: Changed my whole perspective on tea
review/text: I was not exactly a tea lover before I had this.  I did like tea, but I didn't love it.  I found Mighty Leaf at Nijiya Japanese Market and reluctantly bought it when another brand I had enjoyed wasn't there.  What a great time for them to be out of my old stuff!<br /><br />Not only are the tea leaves in these packets really delicious, but they make an incredible amount of tea.  I drank a 16 ounce cup of tea, then later filled my cup back up with hot water and the tea was still dark and flavorful.  Pretty remarkable, I'd never had a tea bag do that before.<br /><br />Tea has replaced my morning coffee recently.  I find that starting the day with tea is a smoother start.  I get coffee later, but start with tea now because it hydrates and doesn't spike your caffeine.<br /><br />I highly recommend this variety pack.

I emailed the company for the ingredients in the "natural flavoring" and they stated that would not be able to disclose the ingredients for natural flavoring.  Natural is too broad and perhaps something that would be undesireable or an allergin.

review/summary: Great Quality Meal for Home, Office, or College
review/text: I keep several of these McDougall's meals in my office at work.  They are high quality and taste great.  I like the convenience when I forget to pack my lunch.  I'm vegan and find it difficult to eat out in the area where I work, so having these stashed in my office is great.  My daughter is in college, so we send her a care package of McDougall's once in a while and she loves them too.  It's so easy to do with Amazon and these are perfect for college students.<br /><br />The preparation is easy if you follow the directions.  Although you microwave them, there are a couple extra steps with adding water, stirring, heating, stirring again, etc.  But the preparation is very manageable and worth the small extra effort to get such a nutritious, vegan meal.<br /><br />As a full grown male, the serving size is a little small, so I need to either fix two of these or have something with it, like a hand full of nuts, some fruit, or a small salad.<br /><br />Definitely worth trying!

review/summary: Solid Low Sodium Alternative
review/text: A co-worker got me hooked on these. I had never heard of them before and they are VERY hard to find in the grocery store so I have resorted to buying them at Amazon. It tastes way better then those styrofoam cup alternatives. The serving size is slighly smaller then the alternatives but its whole wheat noodles with more fiber. Plus the fat content is nearly zero and the sodium is nearly half of the alternatives, its just delicious. I usually only use 1/2 the ginger/soy packet. Using the whole thing makes it a little strong for me. The only reason I didnt get 5 stars is that it tends to leave a after taste in my mouth and if I use the whole packet it can lead to some nasty breath.<br /><br />There not cheap either 6 for ~$12 nearly $2 per cup. However, eating something healthy and just tastes better is worth it. I would definately buy again.

review/text: So far all of the McDougalls brand noodles have been amazing (can't say the same for the soups though), and a healthy and tasty option for those of us stuck in a cube all day. Also great for those counting calories and portions! Unfortunately this specific flavor is always boiling over in the microwave, causing me to have to put in a mattress of paper towels each time. Not sure what it is, as I use less than the specified amount of water and each time it boils over! Tasty product nonetheless, highly recommend!

review/summary: Lovely color, great to work with
review/text: The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for "highlighting" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.
