review/summary: Wellness is great
review/text: I give my three Shih Tzu's Wellness treats and they love them.  I love them as they are a fully nutritious treat.  Each piece is small and easily broken in half  when I want to simply "reward" the dogs for something they have done. Larger dogs would certainly want a larger "cookie" but for training treats, these would work well for any size dog.  I keep a variety of flavors around and when I ask if anyone wants a cookie, they all come running!

review/text: I HAD to have a General Foods Cappucino Cooler every morning and have been very upset that I can't find them anywhere anymore.  My DH found these Maxwell House Internations Cafe Iced Latte and picked them up because they looked similar.  It's the exact same product.  I'm so happy I can have these again.  I'm not a big fan of milk and this helps me drink a glass every day.  Kraft owned General Foods and it appears they own Maxwell House too...

review/summary: Absolutely Delicious Iced Coffee
review/text: This is probably the best iced coffee you will ever find (if you like tasty coffee, and not bitter black coffee). However... this place is kind of high, you can get it at Walmart online for $1.78. At the store I think it's about the same. But you can also get two boxes for I think $2.30. So I don't think I'll be buying this from Amazon... unless Walmart doesn't have any.

That is unless you live three hours away from the nearest grocery store, then go ahead.<br /><br />This iced coffee is surprisingly good and can be addictive. It is a little sweet and mild coffee flavor. It's nice to have for days when you don't want to go to the drive through for an iced coffee. Highly recommended. Great flavor.

review/summary: Was hoping for better results...
review/text: I bought this item 2 weeks ago...first I am 48 yrs old..never had puffiness till about 6 months ago. I thought it was allergies... NOPE! I have bought several different items...from several manufacturers. Most have not worked. I read the reviews for this product and thought why not..it is a good price.Yes there is a smell to it but I did not even notice the "coffee smell" until about the 3rd time of using it. It does not bother me and I feel it does not last "that" long. I am however a disappointed in my results. Yes it did reduce the puffiness "some" but not as much as I was hoping for. I know it will never go away totally but was hoping for better results. It is a wonderful moisturizer !! I do notice a little greasiness but just cut down on your amount you are using.

review/summary: Although I haven't seen too many results yet, it's still a great moisturizer
review/text: I've been using this stuff for around 3 or 4 weeks now.  I haven't seen any visible improvements in the dark circles under my eyes.  I don't really have crows feet or bags under my eyes (with or without cream) so I can't say how it would work with firming the skin.  As far as minimizing the appearance of fine lines - it accomplishes that as well as any moisturizer I have tried.<br /><br />That being said, it is a wonderful light weight cream.  It has a delicate scent that isn't overwhelming.  It doesn't contain any perfumes, but I think it smells a bit like milk chocolate.  I also like the fact that it is a natural product and I'm not risking my health when using it.

review/summary: Pretty Darn Good
review/text: I just got this product the other day..while I know I should probably wait a week or so to write a review on this, I can't help but note that so far this product feels great!  I had really puffy allergy eyes; this product makes the skin around my eyes SUPER soft and fine lines don't look as noticeable.  I like the hint of coffee smell. Its not overpowering at all. Even if you don't like the smell of coffee, I don't foresee it being an issue with this product.  I've used it both at night and during the day.  I woke up in the morning with less puffy eyes; I didn't feel an immediate "tightening" feeling like i have with other products such as the garnier nutritioniste anti-puff eye roller..but I also found I needed to reapply that throughout the day. So far the "anti-puff" effect of this product lasts through the majority of my work day.  Also, this is a great product for applying concealer.  I use Bare Escentuals (powder makeup) and this product allowed for a primer-like base for applying the powder concealer.  All in all I would recommend this product.  I only gave it 4 stars because I don't think I waited long enough to write a review.

review/text: I bought this product, not sure what to expect.  I quickly found that it caused irretation and sat on top of the skin.  I had to stop using it, and didn't mind because I didn't like that it felt oily on my skin.  As an alternative, I opted for the olay eye roller.  Maybe I am an isolated case and this doesn't bother other people, but for me, this product was no good (but it did smell nice).

review/text: I have to admit, I don't track the results, so who knows if it's working, but I have no complaints.  It also smells amazing and the consistency is good. My only issue is that the pump is stiff, so you either end up getting nothing, or spilling out far more than you could ever use on two eyes in just one pump.  I feel like i put more energy into dispensing it than anything else.  Otherwise though, no complaints.

review/summary: for price, this is a top facial moisurizer
review/text: Pure products as a whole are five stars, and for an eye cream, this is good, just not sure I would order it again.  If you use this as an all-over face moisturizer, I find this to be great!  This might be end up in my top favorite facial moisturisers but not specifically for my eye area.  I would rotate this product with other products depending on how my skin is on certain days.<br /><br />For the price, this is a very good product and good for days where you want to go natural.  I would only recommend using it as a total-face moisturizer rather than just and eye area because it absorbs well, and has a better effect on the entire face as it does not cause breakouts, helps fine lines, and is not overly oily (I have combination-oily skin.)<br /><br />I don't like the coffee smell (and I love coffee) but as with all Pure products, the ingredients are wonderful and I would take that any day over an artificial fragrance or modified ingredient.<br /><br />This is a good alternating facial cream, I don't use it everyday, but when I do, I have good results with no irritation or negative effects, and that is saying a lot for me because my skin breaks out easily with pretty much any facial cream.<br /><br />If you go to the Pure website, they give a lot of free products away on orders, so if you are ordering more than one item, I recommend buying direct.

review/text: I really do swear by this stuff.  I use it as my daytime moisturizer under makeup.  It is silky smooth, highly emollient, absorbs easily, and actually takes away puffiness and visibly reduces lines almost instantly.  I'm not a coffee lover, but the scent is very light and actually reminds me more of chocolate than it does coffee. A little goes a long way, but don't worry if you use a bit too much as its equally effective on those fine lines across the bridge of the nose and around the lips. Don't waste it.  I don't use it for night as I'm not worried how puffy or wrinkled I look once I've washed off my makeup and would rather save it for daytime. So for those asking "Does this stuff really work?", I can honestly say YES!

review/text: I have horrible, huge bags and dark circles under my eyes and have all my life (I'm 59 years old).  I've toyed with the idea of plastic surgery and then decided to give this a try.  Within two or three days I saw a HUGE difference.  I use it not only under my eyes but above on the eyelid.  It does smell a bit different but it's so creamy and absorbs quickly. You only need a tiny bit!  I use it in the morning and at night and highly recommend this product.  What a find!!!!!

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Puffiness under your eyes:  not desirable, even embarassing.  This puffiness is caused by a genetic condition or more likely fluid retention due to environmental factors, i.e., sun, pollution, or lifestyle such as too much sodium in the diet, not enough sleep, stress, ageing.... Skin around the eyes is delicate and should be treated with respect.  Better than tea bags and cucumber slices, Coffee Bean Eye Cream smooths on gently, and is Organic with no harsh chemicals or Parabins to be absorbed through the skin.<br />I tried several products with poor results and thought I would always be plagued by this.  However this product works even when I have too much salt or not enough sleep.  I use it daily and am completely satisfied with it.  Perfect!

review/summary: not bad!!!
review/text: I usually hate cream. I hate putting creams and oily junk on my face. I dont ever put sun screen on my face. Im latin and we dont need extra oil. But as I get older Im starting to see more crows by my eyes and smile lines. So Im trying to break my bad habit of not using creams. If youre like me me when it comes to creams and lotions, then this is the product for you. I really like this product. The smell is a little weird but its not bad. I dont drink coffee and think the smell can be overwhelming some times but it doesnt smell like coffee. Its mild and goes away within a few minutes. It feels good and Ive noticed a difference around my eyes. Really good product and a even better price!!<br /><br />Update: after a few months of using this product I realized why I wasnt sleeping very well. Its coffee, Duh! I dont drink coffee or do caffeine. Its also started burning a bit in my eyes area. If you dont have issues with caffeine, this is great- but if you do, might want to stay away from this product.

review/summary: A little goes a long way
review/text: I purchased this from the 100% pure website directly.  They offer free shipping on orders over $50 and free samples with all orders.  I decided to purchase from this company since many of their products are organically certified (the only certification available in the world of cosmetics), so I trusted their composition.<br /><br />This eye creme is a little thick, as the previous reviewer noted.  However, when you pump it, it comes out in a needle -thin string of creme that is easy to apply!  It blends in very well.  You don't need much at all.  I don't even use a full pump for both eyes!  Any excess, I just rub on my hand since it's silky smooth.  The only thing that I'm not crazy about is the smell.  It's not quite coffee; it reminds me of a cookie.  It smells good, but it's not something that I enjoy smelling every morning.  But it's much better than having fragrances added to the product!  (That's my reason for 5-stars instead of 4-stars.)<br /><br />I don't use the creme at night, so I don't have the same problem as the other reviewer.  However, it is always a good idea to keep ALL cosmetics out of the eye!  Any cosmetic/creme (natural or not) is not healthy for the eye, and the reaction will naturally be adverse since the eye is trying to 'fight the invader.'

review/summary: This WORKS!!!
review/text: This really works!! Within a week I noticed a huge difference in my under eye circles. I work night shift and I usually do not get enough sleep. I bought a very expensive La Mer The Eye Concentrate and used it twice a day for 4 months with no improvement. In fact they were getting worse!!! Out of desperation I searched Amazon and based on the reviews bought 100% Pure. I am sold for life. My little wrinkles are also becoming less noticeable. The smell is fine, honestly it could smell like a sewer and I would still put it on because it works. It is so refreshing to buy a product that delivers on their claims. Thank you :-)

review/text: I've been using this product for about a month and do see some improvement in the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. I have chronically 'clogged' sinuses, so I was happy to find something that seems to alleviate the resulting darkess/swelling I get from this. Hopefully as I continue to use this product, I'll see even more improvement. It is also very gentle--some products have caused redness and irritaion around my eyes. And I like the scent--reminds me of cocoa butter.

review/summary: The Light Under my Eyes!
review/text: I fortunately bought the MINI version of this off their website and am so glad I did! I will probably ONLY buy it in this form as it is super easy to push out of the tube. (I only note this as reading other reviews regarding the pump) The product smells exactly like their Tahiti line of body products; which makes me happy every time I use it. (sort of like vanilla coffee) I have noticed a huge difference in my eyes and am really thankful for this product. My small lines seem to disappear and the product sinks right into my under eye area. I even put it on the eyelids. I swear my under eyes look brighter and I don't even need to use my concealer! I had been using Origins similar product to no avail and decided to try this. SUPER GLAD I DID! I would recommend it in the small version (cheaper too!) to try it out. I love 100% Pure and all their products!

review/text: Not a huge fan of this eye cream. It takes forever to dry so its not as practical in the morning when I am in a hurry and don't have so much time to wait. Putting on makeup when its still wet is not pretty under the eyes, which defeats the point of using the cream. It works better as a nite treatment. Haven't noticed any dramatic improvements so far in reducing puffiness and dark circles. Its also quite oily. One pump delivers way too much cream also. Would not purchase again.

It didn't come with directions, when I first tried to get any of this out of the tube the right way, the bottom of the plastic tube broke open, so I could never use this properly, and the bags under my eyes are just as big as before.

What is even more interesting, is that my skin feels so smooth where I have applied this cream.  Unusually smooth.  I think it provides more than adequate hydration to my eye area and a little bit goes a long way.  I am very happy with this product and will purchase more when I run out.  I hope that they come up with a SPF formula to go along with this product.

review/text: I've been using this product for about 2 years.  The smell of it is wonderful, very strong coffee scent.  And I swear it reduces those pesky under-eye circles.  Believe me, I've been looking for a product that lightens my circles for several years.  I like to keep mine in the refridgerator because the coolness of the cream reduces my bags and also shrinks the blood vessles quicker.  Use every day to see the results for yourself.  It will also last a long time, the price is well worth it.

review/summary: It's an ok moisturizer but that's it
review/text: This is a very over priced natural ineffective product. Maybe people give it good reviews because of the natural ingredients and the coffee smell. But for me, this eye cream never lightened my dark circles, never diminished my lines and never changed my puffy eyes. I used it at night only and would either waste or put it on heavy because the bottle dispenses too much product for both eyes. On more than one occasion my eye duct would get clogged and my eye would ache like someone punched me. It would go away if I didn't use any cream for a few days. This is the only eye cream that ever did that to me. I will never buy or recommend this product. A waste of $20.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I can't find anything that isn't absolutely perfect about this eye cream...(except perhaps the pump which when I'm half the way through clogs up and I have to take the top off and scrape it out).  Small price to pay for this really inexpensive product.<br /><br />The scent is vanilla/coffee (and I really don't care for either scent), but it smells different than most artificially scented beauty items because it truly is 100 percent pure.  The vanilla/coffee disappears very quickly.<br /><br />It has the perfect consistency for both upper and lower lids, and the perfect slip for makeup (the makeup goes on right over it...perfect)  I don't get the reviewer who had it in her eyes for days, but maybe her eyes are shaped differently.  I don't use very much, but when I do get a little too much out I put some on my cheeks (makes a really good anything cream).  I also always put some over my upper lip as I do with any eye cream to help with a few vertical lines.  I was using a very high end product which I really liked (never thought I'd use anything else), and then I gave this a try, and I just can't go back.<br /><br />Just had to write this review because I'm purchasing my fourth bottle.<br /><br />Update:040612-<br />After trying the new packaging with the pump, I wish I could take off a star.  The product is still remarkable (even better, acually), but the new pump...well...it broke off at the top (and I'm very easy on my things), and I now<br />have to squeeze it out.  I'm going to have to buy the smaller version.  I will never be able to get it all out.

It is a great lotion: it isn't too heavy, lasts all day and isn't sticky like some eye creams. I do not find the smell overpowering nor do I mind it; I really don't know how to describe it but "cookies" seems to fit. I use it daily but basically all it is at this point is a lotion I'm trying to use up. I won't purchase it again.

And yes it has a small scent of coffee, but I'm a coffee drinker right from the south and drink plenty every day.So the smell is nothing compared to what this product can do for you. When I wake up in the morning the first thing I do is put my contacts in and reach for my Coffee Bean Eye Cream. I put it under my eyes and above my lips and then I get my morning coffee. Then I'm ready to put my other creams on my face over my eye cream and by then the bags and some of the wrinkles are taken care of. Awesome product!

review/text: I have never used an eye cream that took away puffiness or circles.  I'm kind of an insomniac and don't get much sleep.  Therefore I usually have circles under my eyes.  This cream was amazing.  It took away most of the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.  The process is almost immediate.  I put on the cream, then my makeup and by the time I'm ready to go out the door, my eyes are improved by 80%.  The smell that others complain about is minimal and lasts only a couple seconds.  It is worth giving this product a try.  I use it everyday now that I'm awar of it and will continue to do so!  I love this product.  The product can last you a long time as another person said.  One whole squirt is a little much.  I use about 1/2 a squirt.  One whole squirt is a lot of cream for under two eye areas.

I use this nearly every morning. it's really creamy and blends in well. I don't even use a whole pump for both eyes.<br /><br />The only problem I've noted with this product is it takes awhile to absorb fully into the skin, so sometimes I'll rub my eye and the product bothers it. It burns abit, but nothing major. so only a very minor bother.<br /><br />There's not really any smell that I noted either, Unless I sniff it as soon as it comes out of the tube, I never noticed it having any smell while wearing it.

review/text: This eye cream is exactly what I was looking for. It's natural, vegan, silky, and really helps with my dark circles. It's not a miracle by any means, but it helps as much as I feel it should with what it advertizes. I would not use this if you wanted to treat something like wrinkles, but it's very hydrating so it's great for preventative measures. I use it twice a day in addition to massage to relieve my dark circles and it seems to work great. My only complaint is that the bottle can be really stubborn and I have to give it several pumps before any product will come out, but other than that it's a great product. I highly recommend it.

Misleading and deceptive.  I'm not so sure it's as effective as the one I previously bought from the same company. Makes me very suspicious and possibly not worth the money.  If I wanted Aloe Vera for my eyes, I can just buy that.

review/summary: No Mind-Blowing Results but Still Worth a Try
review/text: I bought Pure Cosmetics Coffee Bean Eye Cream back in May 2011, took a month's break from it in Sept, but have gone back to it. The results weren't mind-blowing when I was using it daily from May through mid-September, but I used it anyway because it's better than nothing. To be honest, I like how it moisturizes better than other eye creams and gels that I've used. I apply it under concealer for hydration and protection from whatever stressful effects cosmetics and living/working in NYC has had on my dry-to-sensitive skin. I used it without make-up for most of the summer to give my skin a break, but I saw no firming or brightening effects... just moisturized/hydrated. As I stated before, it's better than nothing.<br /><br />The "coffee bean" scent is indescribably NOT coffee, cookie, or cocoa... maybe a light version of a box of soggy waffle cones? I highly recommend you smell this at a store before you buy it. It's a super soft and creamy scent, yes, but still distinct and unappealing to me. It's basically become a general and accepted reflex to hold my breath for the few seconds I dab this on. I'm still using it because its moisturizing ways are worth it. Plus, I love the pump... it's a welcome relief from jars and tubes.<br /><br />I don't expect results from this, now that I've gone back to using it, but it feels good under my eyes: no irritation, whatsoever (i.e. my eyes don't water or itch when I dab it on my skin); moisturizing/hydrating; and very light and smooth.<br /><br />Basically: It's better than what I've previously used. However, no life-changing results... but better than nothing.

review/summary: It reduced puffy eyes for me!
review/text: I really like this eye cream. I used department store brands for years, but have been trying to reduce the amount of chemicals I put on my skin, and so turned to 100% Pure. This creams works very well. I use this in the morning first thing and it truly reduces puffy morning eyes. I like to do it right after I wash my face, but before I do my eye make up, so it can soak in. It smells a bit like coffee, but I figure that is better than artificial fragrance. All synthetic fragrances do is mask chemical odors anyway. I have used this eye cream for months and see an improvement in the appearance of the skin around my eyes. Even better, it has not created any of the little white bumps that result from clogged pores that I have experienced with well-known department store brands. I will continue buying this one!

review/summary: Do not believe the hype
review/text: If this stuff gets near your eyes you will look through a haze for days (for example, you put it on away from your eyes but as you sleep it gets on the pillow then on your eyelids).  It takes forever to sink in your skin.  Smells nice, though...if you are a coffee lover.  The pump was broken on mine when I got it so I had to take the lid off to use.  It is very thick, almost like cream cheese, so it's difficult to get out of the jar (I figure that's why the pump wouldn't work).  I used (nightly) almost the whole bottle with no results in face condition.  It sits on top of the skin so I generally had to wash it off in the morning before applying make-up.

review/summary: Nothing outstanding or remarkable, but it gets the job done
review/text: I've been using this for about two months (always at least once a day), and while I definitely can say, "Sure, this is okay," I wouldn't go out of my way to suggest or recommend it.<br /><br />I like that there are no super crazy or funky ingredients.  I can put this all over my eyes with zero irritation and no itching, and I have to admit I really love the smell (yum!)--it seems a lot stronger when you first start using it, but it disappears pretty quickly.<br /><br />THE PRODUCT: The cream is a white, thin lotion that spreads easily.  It's not the kind of lotion that instantly absorbs into your skin, and a little goes a long way!  There is going to be a moist film left behind for a while, so if you're an instant-absorption sort of person, this might catch you off-guard. However, I like that it doesn't instantly dry because my eyes feel more hydrated.<br /><br />THE PACKAGING: There are several comments talking about how crappy the pump is and how it 'breaks' easily.  I haven't experienced it directly breaking, but I can see how people might have problems.  The pump doesn't pull lotion from very deep inside the bottle, so it leaves behind a gap in the lotion eventually each time you pump because it doesn't "settle" to fill the spot after use.  If you squeeze from the bottom of the bottle a little bit before using or unscrew the top and jostle the bottle a bit, you'll be able to "fill" that hole created over time through using the pump.<br /><br />RESULTS:  I'm in my early 20s and have been blessed with pretty good genes, so wrinkles and puffy under-eyes really aren't a huge issue for me.  However, I really love how moisturizing and hydrating this cream is.  The smell is pleasant, and I'm probably about halfway through the tube in two months, so I'd say it's a decent bang for my buck.<br /><br />Give it a shot!  If wrinkles and puffiness are a concern for you, this might not be your holy grail product, but it's also inexpensive enough that I think it's worth trying out without feeling awful if it doesn't work.<br /><br />One tiny note - I don't know if this is relevant, but I have noticed since using this product I seem to have gained a small cluster of freckles around my eyes in places I've never had freckles before.  I don't know if it's from this product, but it certainly struck me as unusual.

review/text: This eye cream smells really good. I'm not sure it really delivers your eyes from looking tired. It's supposed to lift the skin around the eyes. I don't see much of this happening but it does lighten the dark circles you get from not enough sleep or from being tired. I use with other eye products and it seems to work better then on its own. Not sure if I will buy it again?

review/text: I have puffiness under my eyes. Maybe you can even call them bags because they rarely disappear. I have had insomnia for decades and that is likely the cause. I tried this product. It smells like capuccino, yummy. But, after using it a few times, my puffiness has not improved one bit. Perhaps it is because the puffiness is fat and not water retention. I am 45 years old and maybe these bags are here to stay.

review/text: I like the smell of the product, it's fresh. It seems a little greasy but I put it on at the end of the day after I have taken off my makeup and when I wake up it has been soaked up by my skin. I do not like the pump dispenser. One full pump and you unload enough cream for your entire face. You have to press down halfway on the pump to dispense the right amount. I was looking for a product that would reduce the amount of lines around my eyes, this one is supposed to make the area around my eyes look "more awake and youthful". I made the purchase because it says it's 100% pure and 100% natural. It wasn't very expensive so it was worth a try.

review/text: I have been using under every cream ever since I was 14.  I don't have any dark circles or puffiness and I use it mainly to moisturize the eye area.  I like this eye cream due to the fact that it is natural and absorbs to the skin fast without leaving any oily feeling.  The size of the tube is huge and will last you a very long time, therefore it is worth the price.  the only thing that bothers me is the smell, which tends to disappears after 10+ minutes.  I'm not sure if I will be repurchasing this product, as I may try a different eye cream from 100 percent pure.

review/summary: Good Eye Cream
review/text: When I ordered this eye cream from Amazon it was out of stock and the website did not reflect that. So, I purchased it from the 100 Percent Pure Website. So far I have been using it for a little over two weeks. It is very hydrating but the hydration does not last all day; it helps reduce puffiness and dark circles. However, I did not notice any reduction in fine lines. So, don't expect any miracles there. Overall, it is a good eye cream when compared to the unnatural ones I have used. I would also like to mention that it has the smell of some kind of cookies.

Being a mid to late 20's girl, I really just wanted something to help with my dark circles and hold up the aging process a little bit via fine lines starting to form around my eyes.  I love the texture and thickness of this cream.  It really does absorb well and isn't creasy at all.  But, it smells like playdough, not coffee-ish, or cocoa-ish even.  I haven't noticed an improvement at all.  I've been using it for 3 weeks now, so something should've shown by now.<br />I do have to say, that the ingredients are listed right on the bottle, and it doesn't get any better than organic everything, pretty much.  Just wished it worked better for me!

It also helps smooth the wrinkles<br />that have developed around the outside edges of the puffs when I apply it. I enjoy applying it because it is silky  feeling and smells like sugar cookies.

review/summary: Smells awful, nice product
review/text: First off, I have to compliment Amazon on their wonderful delivery time. Perfect.<br />Secondly, the packaging of this product was absolutely adorable. Upon opening the package, I noticed the cream was in a pump tube, which is a plus, but it limits the control on the amount I can squeeze out at a time. Trust me you will only need about 2/3 or less of the cream that comes out of each pump. In that regard I feel that it is a bit of a waste, but I suppose I can deal with it because it is an all natural product. With that said, the smell is awful. I enjoy coffee smells, and even I thought that some of the other complaints regarding the smell were exaggerations. However, that is not the case. For some reason it does not smell like coffee. It is sort of a nauseating warm smell with a hint of expired butter cream and butter scotch. I know that all noses are different, and that each of us like different smells, but even for me this was too much. If you want to avoid smelling the product while applying, hold your breath and apply away from the nose as far up to the eye area as possible. I would not use it as a moisturizer because of the smell. It has a very emollient texture and it is a bit oily at first. I have oily to normal skin, so I do not use moisturizers (even though I should)(it does absorb well though in given time). I rather not take the risk of using this as a moisturizer because it is not diluted enough. As an eye cream it is a good product. I am excited to see the results within the next few weeks and will edit this review regarding the effects of the product. I am very please it is all natural. The other few body products from 100% pure are a bit of a bust for me, but their blush and powder/pressed makeups are lovely!

review/summary: Great Product!
review/text: I first heard about this product from my mother-in-law, and then I did a lot of research about it online. My job is time-consuming, so my problem has always been massive dark circles under my eyes. I bought this product in the hopes that it would help make them disappear.<br /><br />I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now, and although my dark circles are not completely gone, I can definitely tell a difference. I use this creme every morning between washing my face and applying make-up. You need VERY LITTLE product between both eyes...hardly even a pump. This was a nice fact, since the bottle appears so small for the price. This product illuminates my under-eyes, especially when applied under my foundation. It has a very prominent coffee scent, which is also a nice perk (haha) when I'm getting ready early in the morning.<br /><br />I would suggest not using this product right before bed, because the coffee scent may way you up.<br /><br />To summarize:<br />PROS - very little needed, great coffee scent, early-morning pick-me-up, seems to be working on my under-eye circles<br />CONS - a little pricy (but again, you really dont need much at all with each application), great coffee scent may keep you from falling asleep at night

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I bought this product because It contains caffeine and Dr. Oz said that caffeine will reduce puffiness under the eyes.  So, I had high expectations and was very excited to try it.  I'm very disappointed so see that it does not work for me.  In fact, a while after using it, I went out and saw some friends.  They all told me that my eyes looked very puffy and tired, like I just woke up.  After telling me that, I told them about the eye cream.  Any eye cream that I have ever tried tends to emphasize the puffiness under my eyes instead of reducing it.  I'm at a loss as to what to do about it.

review/summary: Genetically puffy eyes SUCK - but this stuff works
review/text: So, I wish I had found this stuff at least 15 years ago.<br />It smells like cookies and it works if you apply it 3 times a day. It doesn't say how many times to apply, but I've been using it a lot.<br />I've been cursed with baggage under my eyes thanks to my mothers side of the family and have used different organic methods to rid of them for years but have not had any real success.<br />Until now.. this cream seems to actually deflated the puffiness! What seemed impossible now looks possible. We'll see tho.. I got this about 3 weeks ago. I'll update again in another 3 weeks.

review/summary: love the ingredients
review/text: I am not a fan of eye creams.  I have very oily skin to begin with BUT, I love that it is organic, I love that it is natural and I would say without a doubt if that is the life you are striving for then this is the product for you.  I have to say the smell is a little overpowering to go to sleep with, that is the only downfall.  I got a sample of this through the NTH Review Group @ [...]

review/summary: Smells great and works like it says it does!
review/text: I received this product to try as part of a review group @ [...]<br /><br />I thought the scent reminded me more of chocolate than it did of coffee, but the smell is light and enjoyable. I noticed right away after applying, that the puffiness under my eyes had been reduced significantly. I also noticed the finer lines were looking less rigid. It's important to me that the ingredients are all natural, and I enjoy the fact this cream doesn't leave a sticky feeling or a greasy film either.<br /><br />I love this product and will purchase more when I run out!
