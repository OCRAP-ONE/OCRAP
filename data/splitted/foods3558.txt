review/summary: Strong Cinnamon
review/text: I was impressed with the price of the tea and how quickly I received it.  I do agree with others that it has a very strong cinnamon flavor.  I expected that when I ordered it through reading the reviews.  I love to drink chai tea and while the flavor is definitely overwhelmingly cinnamon, I like it. It tastes like liquid red hots to me.  I am able to make very large cups of tea and still have the strong cinnamon flavor.  I am planning on ordering other versions of Davidson's chai teas to see if the flavor is any different.  I think it is a very good value.  If you are not a big fan of strong cinnamon flavor, try something else.

review/summary: Yummm!  (If you love cinnamon.)
review/text: Steeped until deep luscious cinnabar red, this has become my go-to tea.  It needs no additional sweetening for day-to-day use; but with honey and lemon, it could be dessert.  I would highly recommend this tea to cinnamon lovers.  That said, I have noticed that the amount of cinnamon can vary from bag to bag.  If not for that variation, I'd give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, this tea made my transition from all things caffeinated tolerable.  Although this might not work for everyone, I found the flavor robust enough for early morning, which was my main criterion.  (Unfortunately, it did nothing for the rotten caffeine withdrawal headache.)

review/summary: Not what I call chai...
review/text: Very heavy on cinnamon, and I'm quessing cardamon. I really can't pick apart what makes "chai", but I like chai, and this isn't it. Very strong cinnamon. I even mixed it 1 to 3 parts loose black tea, and still strong. Not too bad with juice. Maybe even resembles mulling spices.<br />It does make a nice potporri for large rooms.

review/summary: WOW!!!
review/text: I have been drinking chai rooibos teabags which I liked.  When I received this order, I made a fresh pot of tea.  My husband and I were surprised by the aroma and flavor-and my kids too.  I am sure there is better quality chai rooibos out there, but this is as good as it gets for the price.  I put 4-5 table spoons of tea into a coffee filter and tie it with the cotton string- give some room in the bag for the tea to expand.  This worked better than any tea infuser, and none of visible chunk escaped.  I will buy it again!  Happy tea time~~~

review/summary: Sweet and Cinnamon punch
review/text: I usually order the normal organic South African Rooibos Tea and have jugs of this prepared in the fridge for iced tea, and even prepare half and half lemon rooibos tea.  I wanted to try something different and decided to order a bag of the spiced chai for a change.  I have enjoyed this Organic Spiced Rooibos Chai, hot with soy milk.  It's amazing, adding a bit of sweetener adds extra sweetness or just as is, this tea is sweet and cinnamon punch gives it an original yummy and exotic perfect taste if you like strong flavors. I make a cup every night in my coffee maker and sit and read.  It could be an option to replace your morning coffee as well if you want to drop the caffeine.  With or without milk makes a great hot tea.

review/summary: very tasty herbal tea
review/text: I have always purchased this tea in tea bags.....however, never again.  The loose tea is stronger, richer, and if you add sweetener and whole milk, the tea is raised to dessert status.  It's strongly flavored with cinnamon and other herbs and spices.  This makes for  great mouth feel along with a high satisfaction factor.  Most of the time I enjoy a large mug of tea before going to bed. It relaxes me and I sleep very well, or have an afternoon cup for break.  This tea has moved up to my favorite herbal tea and second only to my morning cup of black tea.  I whole-heartedly recommend it, and for that matter, any and all Davidson's teas.  (No, I don't work there, but their outlet store is five miles away and they have wonder gift items.)  Catalog is available on-line.

I don't do well with caffeine, so this has become my usual tea.<br /><br />I do tend to let it cool before I drink it.  I drink most of my tea that way.  This blend has the extra advantage that the flavor stays sweet and balanced if I leave it on the leaves in the teapot while it cools.

I also tried several other brands of spiced chai and they did not even compare to Davidson's Spiced Chai.  They were almost bland compared to Davidson's.

Simply way overwhelming.  I have to assume this was a mistake because brewing it reminded me of the spice packs one might boil to create aroma in the house over the holidays.  In fact that is my plan for the remainder, to take it to my mother's on Thanksgiving for her to use in scenting her home.<br /><br />Hail Flavius!

review/summary: Worst Chai Ever
review/text: I opened the bag and thought I'd walked into Santa's Potpourri Shoppe--ack! I have tried almost a dozen chai teas over the years (Numi, Yogi, Choice, Pacific, and small, independent makers at their own tea shops.) Nothing has ever smelled like this: a horrendously strong/concentrated dose of clove and cinnamon. It was strong to the point of making my eyes water and irritating my throat, and my fingers as I handled it.<br /><br />I handled it in order to sift out the big chunks of cinnamon. There was a bit over a whole cup of cinnamon pieces (that smelled stronger than any cinnamon sticks I'd ever cooked with), and 4 cups of tea leaves (that stank to the heavens of clove.) I couldn't bring myself to taste this stuff--I brewed a little of the leaf part but couldn't bring myself to taste it--it would be like drinking clove oil.<br /><br />I called Davidson's to give them feedback and ask, basically, "what is that awful smell?" It seems I had missed the "Product Details" that came after the "Product Features" before I ordered. If I had seen any sort of oils listed I never would have ordered--THAT's what makes this stuff so overbearing. Good Chai is made with bits of actual spices not concentrated oils.<br /><br />But the contents differed from detail here of "natural flavor oils". On the bag it says "Ingredients (*Certified Organic Ingredient): Rooibos*, cinnamon* & natural flavor." Note the "natural flavor" is not organic, and there's no way to know what's in it or how the flavorings were processed. It could be more than oils. "Natural" just means it's not gmo or petroleum-based/synthetic; it does not mean it's not MSG, hydrolyzed wheat protein, or that it does not have plants-processed-with alcohol-until-they-become-chemicals-that-work-as-preservatives in it.<br /><br />Amazon issued me a refund but did not want the product back. There's no way I'm ingesting this, and I don't want it in my compost...maybe I could give it away as sachets of xmas potpourri a TEASPOON per room.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: This tea is amazing!  I am somewhat new to drinking tea (specially loose leaf) as I've always been a coffee drinker.  This tea has excellent flavor.  It's supposed to be chai, but it really does have more of a cinnamon taste with almost a touch of sweetness to it.  There is definitely no need to sweeten it, at least in my opinion.  I think another reviewer said that it made their throat burn, but I've found that review to be a little over dramatic, now that I've had the tea myself...I just can't see how that could happen.  Anyway, I love this tea and it's great for sipping on in the evening before bed, also seems to keep those late night cravings at bay :)

review/summary: I adore this tea at bedtime!
review/text: After reading other reviews, I ordered this tea warily along with the Davidson's Honeybush tea, in case I needed to tone it down a bit. I was pleased with the price for organic tea. Well, no need for the Honeybush, I love this tea as is! It does have a strong cinnamon scent and flavor with hints of clove & perhaps nutmeg or allspice, which I find wonderfully soothing at bedtime. I think it helps me sleep, which can be a problem for me. The cinnamon adds sweetness, which means I forgo my usual teaspoon of sugar. Of course, my favorite chewing gum is Dentyne Fire and I love red hots, so consider the source. If you love cinnamon as I do, I cannot recommend this highly enough!

review/text: This is great tea for people who love chai but are sensitive to caffeine.  I would be absolutely nuts about it if it contained cloves, cardamom, or other spices, but as it is, it seems to be just rooibos and cinnamon. It's still good, though!<br /><br />I drink it unsweetened because the cinnamon has a natural sweetness. I think it might be a little too saccharine if you added honey or sugar, but maybe that's just me.<br /><br />Davidson's gives a relatively good price for an herbal tea like this. Rooibos is usually expensive.

review/text: I switched to this tea about 2 years ago from regular caffeinated tea. Since I switched, I found that I don't actually need caffeine, and also that my teeth got whiter, since the tannin in regular tea will stain teeth.  There is no teeth staining with this tea.<br /><br />As for the 'burning the throat' comments.  I personally find those cinnamon candies and especially cinnamon gum way too strong. This tea is very mild by comparison. I've never experienced any burning or discomfort.<br /><br />My 2 year old likes to drink this tea - he prefers no milk added, and since there's no caffeine it's safe for him.

You haven't tried *anything* until you've tried garlic & butter flavored croutons.  A pack of 12, which understandably may seem pretty darn extreme and unnecessary, will go quick the moment this heavenly, buttery flavor melts in your mouth.  I recommend buying this extraordinary deal and using 11 packs for the munchies while watching the tube, and using only 1 for salads.  You won't be able to resist the taste so it's not like these square-shaped bundles of garlic-y joy stand a chance of making it to your evening salad and spaghetti dinner anyway.

review/text: As a hard core seeder I have tried many brands of seeds including the well-known national brands, the store brands, organically grown seeds, & Bigs. Of all of those choices, the Bigs Sea Salt & Black Pepper rocked my world, blew my mind and knocked my socks off, they are the best. The very first thing I noticed was the jumbo sized seeds which are the best and the hardest to find. The texture of the outside of the seed is like a roasted peanut and it's saturated in flavor. The black pepper jumps up first and makes itself known in a big way. After a few fingerfuls, the salt and other spices get up the courage to start mingling with the pepper and when that happens, you will never forget about these seeds. For days I have been wishing they were available in my local grocery store but I can no longer dream, I must actively search for my new favorite seeds.

review/text: It's my fault for assuming that the ingredients would be sunflower seeds, sea salt and black pepper. This is not the case. It contains regular salt as well as sea salt, and a bunch of other ingredients. I do like the size of the seeds. They're nice and big. But there are also a lot of foreign debris like sticks and other matter. At least one in each bag. I will definitely NOT buy this product again.

review/summary: Awesome taste, but price here is insane!
review/text: I just picked up a couple of bags of these at the local convienence store to hold me over until my bacon seeds arrive. After trying them, I'm really surprised! These have a great peppery taste to them. It may be too strong for some, but I really like them!<br /><br />Now, looking at the price here on Amazon...$41 for a 12 pack?? Seriously?? Why such a high price for these? The bacon & red hot varieties are around $20 for a 12 pack. Why charge over twice the amount for these? Are they really that much in demand?<br /><br />Overall, these are great seeds. I would say one of the best flavors out there. But I just can't justify spending over $40 for a 12 pack of these. Guess I'll have to stick with getting them at the local store.

review/text: Candy is delicious, as is all Godiva. They don't skimp on the flavor, so it's not a "cheap version" of Godiva. But it's overpriced here, as they are sold in most drugstores for $5.99 a bag. If my arithmetic is still good, 6 x 3 =18, so there is no need to buy it online, unless you live somewhere very rural. Thanks!

review/summary: amazon lost a k-cup customer
review/text: I've always bought Emeril's Jazzed up decaf from Amazon (two twentyfour packs for around $24.00). My last order, when I received it, was one twentyfour count box for $27.00. I went back and looked and found that it came from one of Amazons suppliers. I realized that I must of picked the wrong Emerils jazzed up decafs, but wait, there is only one Emeril's jazzed up decaf. I see, Amazon has multiple sellars selling the same thing (but at way different prices). So in my haste to odered my coffee, I picked the wrong vendor. Now this is where I get rubbed the wrong way. Why does Amazon represent all of these different sellers at higher prices than what they themselves sell it for? I returned the coffee and was charged a shipping fee. I told them at that time, if they charged me return freight they would lose a k-cup customer. They did and they have. I placed a $100.00 order for coffee at Kuerig direct and got free shipping. Amazons loss is Kuerigs gain.

This coconut mocha reminds me of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZ8U">Timothy's World Coffee, German Chocolate Cake</a>. It has the same kind of flavor but with a lighter bodied coffee. If you like light coffee's you may like this a lot. I prefer a stronger cup-o-joe and i prefer the Timothies over this. It's nice to a variety of coffee for your guests and this would be a great addition for those who love light bodied flavored coffee. If it drops below .60 cents a cup again I will for sure get some more.

review/summary: From a real flavored k-cup fanatic, this was the WORST coffee I've ever had!
review/text: I got all excited when I saw this at WalMart and didn't hesitate to drop it in my cart. I've become a huge fan of Green Mountain Coconut Island K-cups and since I had just ran out, I thought I'd try this. I didn't even bother to read the box...just figured it was coconut so thought it'd be similar.<br /><br />I first suspected something wrong watching it brew. My cup was rapidly filling up with with heavy white foam. The liquid coming out of the brewer from the k-cup was running whitish clear, very weak looking.<br /><br />My first taste was my last. No way could I bear putting another sip in my mouth. I'm a huge fan of flavored coffee and drink lots of medium brews, not much into the heavy ones. But I'd NEVER ruin my coffee putting milk in it. To a horsegal, well, no self-respecting cowboy or cowgirl adds white stuff to her joe...<br /><br />This coconut mocha - all I could taste was disgustingly way over-sweet and loaded with cream. YUCK! I just couldn't get those two awful flavors out of my mouth. I barely smelled or tasted any coconut and almost no mocha either...<br /><br />Taking the opened box back to WalMart along with this review printed out and demanding my money back.

review/summary: Somewhat weak at the 7 ounce setting
review/text: I have the Keurig with the 7 and 9 ounce settings. As a coconut fanatic, I was so very disappointed in Green Mountain's Island Coconut coffee k cups not necessarily because of the taste, but because even when you use the smallest setting on the coffee maker, it is very weak and tastes like coconut flavored water.<br /><br />I just found these Coconut Mocha k cups while shopping at Staples and grabbed two boxes. Just had my first cup and again, even though this coffee says that it is bold on the box, using the mid-size setting on the Keurig resulted in a good but not great cup as far as strength goes. The taste is very smooth. I did not taste the mocha though, just a smooth coconut flavor that was excellent but I wish it was a little stronger. You can tell while the cup is brewing that the water flow turns clear about halfway through the brewing process so a lot of plain water is added after the initial coffee pours through. I think for the next cup I will pull the cup away to avoid all that additional flavorless water to drop in. Taste-wise these cups are great once you get your desired strength figured out.

review/summary: My cats actually lick the plate clean! Woah.
review/text: Let me start by saying I'm a very cheap person and for the past 4 years have only give my cats Friskees wet food. I actually did splurge and get them Royal Canin Sensitive Stomach as dry food though, in my defense. And that stuff isn't cheap. However, in the past few months, my older cat started licking all the hair off of her stomach and was scratching constantly. Two trips to the vet and two steroid injections later, everything was ruled out but an allergic reaction to either the litter I was using (Arm & Hammer) or the food. To avoid paying more vet bills and to make my little fur baby happy, I decided to man(woman) up and get the good stuff. You know, the stuff with no disgusting animal by-products, rice, grain, and brewer's yeast in it. I never really took the time to read the back of the Friskee's label or the label of the Royal Canin. You think if you pay a lot for something it will be healthy, but it's not! I feel like such a bad parent.<br /><br />In any event I completely switched everything. Started using pine pellets for the litter, which is all natural, and got this Core brand food because it appeared to be exactly what my cats needed -something completely free of anything bad for them. I was also instructed by my vet not to feed them chicken or beef because a lot of allergies come from that. So I have only purchased the Turkey/Duck/Seafood types of Core food; both wet and dry.<br /><br />Summary of the wet: Yeah, it's almost $2.00 a can. Makes you a little ill thinking about it. But I've never seen my cats literally lick the entire plate clean and want more than two servings in a day of ANYTHING. When I fed them Friskee's I was easily throwing away half a can a day just by having it be left over and stale on their plate. Not with this Core food. They devour it and come back for more. It's amazing. My wallet doesn't thank me but those cats sure do!<br /><br />As for the dry food: It's a little different in shape/texture than other dry foods. They eat it, but I think they like the wet better. I leave out dry food during the day in case they get hungry so I know they are eating it, but they much prefer the wet.<br /><br />My animals eat better than I do and get better medical care than I do. *Sigh*

review/summary: Love the cinnamony goodness!
review/text: I love cinnamon in baked goods and often sprinkle it on hot cereal to give it a more homey taste...  Don't know why cinnamon strikes me as a homey taste other than all the baking my grandma did using it when I was growing up.<br /><br />This has the best of all components in it.  Cinnamon is an antioxident, oatmeal is good for cleaning the blood of cholesterol, and the fiber is just good for general health, so what's not to LOVE about this cereal?<br /><br />I like to eat cereal dry as a snack in place of popcorn or chips and this has just enough sweet to it that I feel like I'm splurging when I'm being rather restrained on the sugar front.<br /><br />Plus, this is a great change up for the traditional marshmallow squares recipes for treats.  I add slivered almonds for a little protein and will be trying it with dried apricots diced up and mixed in for a harvest touch.<br /><br />Spice makes it twice as nice!

You get a lot in one serving though and they're fairly healthy so I like that.

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.  Nice cheese flavor.
review/text: I recently tried these, after usually sticking to the Black Bean Sea Salt flavor.  These are certainly different from that flavor, but just as enjoyable.  The cheese flavoring is the perfect flavor for my pallet.  I won't switch to these from the Sea Salt ones, but will definitely add them to my chip rotation.<br /><br />Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories. That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste. To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings. I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these and wish that the bags contained less air and more chips, but otherwise I think they are great. I highly recommend that you try them.  The pricing here on Amazon, is usually about 30 cents per 6 ounce bag cheaper than what they charge at the local grocery store, HEB.  Specialty stores like Sprouts and Whole Foods charge even more for them.

review/summary: A Great Product
review/text: Great tasting, versatile, mild. Goes well in soup, stew and stir fry, but it should be added to other things in the meal, rather than served alone. I had hoped the pieces would be larger, which is why I awarded only 4 stars.<br /><br />Eating exceptionally high portions of Hijiki every day can cause problems because of inorganic arsenic. I eat modest amounts less often, and am not concerned.

review/text: Who else packs 50g of protein with only 3g of sugar and still makes it taste fairly good?  No one.  I'm a big Muscle Milk fan but the same size only has half the protein, so it was a no brainer to switch over for me.  If you're serious about working out then you're already putting your body through pain and misery so drinking a less flavorful drink with everything you need is not going to bother you.  In my opinion its awesome for the amount of protein it packs, so if you're serious about adding lots of quick and easy whey protein to your diet after workouts, this is the drink for you.

review/text: This is my favorite protein drink. In general, I prefer canned protein drinks to mixed powder, and this has the smoothest feel. Another reviewer compared it to Pepto-Bismol, which is true in terms of texture -- it's thicker and more syrupy than most protein drinks. But the taste is rich and about as real as a ultra-low-carb protein drink can get to chocolate milk. Really convenient to take to the gym, and the aluminum bottle stays cool longer than others. I reload a 12-pack of these every week for the house.

review/summary: Great Protein for Your Money and the Taste is Great too!
review/text: I have to say that I only tried this on accident and it was a great accident to find.  I was in GNC looking for something else, when the 50g of protein and only 3g of sugar caught my eye.  The cashier told me to shake it up before drinking.  Not a good idea.  Like the other person that reviewed this, you should OPEN FIRST, THEN CLOSE AND SHAKE. It went all over me because I shook it first.  I have been drinking Muscle Milk prior to this and considering you get way more protein, the taste is good. I am looking to gain weight and I drink this after I workout. Also, for cost comparisons, this is no more than most 40g of protein drinks.<br />Also, on another note, if you are not on a multi-vitamin, you need to check out Animal Pak-original.  It is an incredible multi-vitamin for people working out-the normal multi-vitamins do not cut it.

review/summary: A good deal outside the gym
review/text: I bought these protein drinks because I'm saving over one dollar per bottle compared to the price at my gym. I don't really like the taste, but I think that most people who consume protein drinks on a regular basis for muscle gain sacrifice a little comfort for what they get in terms of nutrients. 50 grams of protein which is not just milk/caseinate protein (cheaper and less efficient than whey), but a mix of milk and whey protein. At the same time, and even more important in my opinion, only 9 grams of carbs and 3 grams of sugar, which means a very low glycemic index compared to tastier protein drinks which are sometimes full of sugar (this drink has 3 grams of fiber which helps counteract the effect of the 3 grams of sugar). Carbohydrates and sugar in particular make your insulin level rise, make you hungrier and lead to more fat storage.<br /><br />So this drink doesn't taste great, but is an excellent and relatively cheap choice for muscle gain (complementing training and good diet). A much healthier option than cheaper or better tasting alternatives out there which are full of carbohydrates and sometimes full of sugar.

review/text: I've tried lots of iced teas and this one outshines them all.  I brew this as a sun tea - putting it in a jar with 3 quarts of water and leaving it in the full sun until the color is deliciously dark.  It usually takes about 3 - 4 hours during the summer here in CA.  I refrigerate the tea once it's brewed, and the flavor lasts up to 3 days, if the tea lasts that long.  Everyone here loves it and drinks it fast!  I don't think it needs any sweetener, but I usually drink my tea black, and the fruit flavor makes it quite sweet enough for my taste.

review/text: I first received Zatarian's Creole Mustard for my birthday over two decades ago from a friend in New Orleans.  It is unique, not really having a strong mustard taste, almost like a horseradish/mustard if you can imagine.  When their factory was wiped out by a hurricane, they e-mailed customers from a remote location with updates on their facilities, employees & product availability.  I HATE MUSTARD AND NEVER USE IT ON ANYTHING but I LOVE ZATARAIN'S CREOLE MUSTARD unconditionally.  I have carefully packed over a dozen of these bottles in my suitcases when I traveled on business to the region.  Now I purchase a dozen on line at a time.  They keep PERFECTLY for OVER 1 TO 2 OR MORE YEARS beyond the date on the bottle if they have not been opened & the vacuum seal is intact.<br /><br />Try a bottle if you like horseradish or spicy 'dark' mustard you will become addicted to it as I & many others have...

It adds a sharpness, a certain piquancy to the mustard in general.<br /><br />While the flavor gets swallowed up in more traditional applications (burgers, dogs, etc.), when taken solo as an addition to a good mustard sauce or as a solo condiment for pastrami, it shines like you wouldn't believe.  Also makes a wonderful bun spread for Carolina-style pulled pork.<br /><br />Definitely worth your time and good for your taste buds.

Normally, I dislike white chocolate but with the coconut, this candy bar is amazing.  The consistency and intensity of the bar is not like a mounds bar.  This is an actual candy bar with no filling.  The coconut flavor is melded with the chocolate.  The bar is fairly large.  I typically take three to four days to eat one bar - the restraint is hard, but at 240 calories a serving restraint is necessary.  Flecks of this bar are great on ice cream but also in thicker, warmer beverages.
