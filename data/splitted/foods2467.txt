review/summary: Always delicious and always expensive
review/text: Kettle chips are always delicious,though a little expensive considering they're just potatoes.  WAY better than anything Frito-Lays puts out.  It's a shame that the independent chip companies are dying out at the local grocers because Frito-Lays crowds them out, when the independents are so much better.  Take a trip to your local Trader Joe's or Amazon to find good chips nowadays, and cheap too if you find them on sale here, cheap all the time at Trader Joe's.

review/summary: A very tasty chip!
review/text: These chips are crisp, tangy and a nice change from barbecue flavor chips.  If you like spicy foods, you'll love these.  The blue cheese is not at all overwhelming, just adds that extra "bite."  The box of chips arrived well packed, nothing broken, and the expiration date was over 3 months in advance, making this a very good value, considering the 20% discount Amazon had during November.

review/summary: OK but not great
review/text: First off the krinkle cut chips are far inferior to the regular style kettle chips in my opinion.  Secondly, the flavor doesn't really capture the taste of buffalo wings or bleu cheese.  They taste kinda weird.  It's probably not the best type of flavor to put on a potato chip, even though I love wings.

review/text: A big fan of kettle-cooked chips since I was a kid, I tend to go around buying any and all brands and flavors I can find.  As a result, Buffalo Bleu was on my list.<br /><br />I was in for a real surprise when I got my hands on this flavor.  It has a great taste -- not too sweet, not too salty -- and a nice crunch.  There's not really anything else to say; if you like good chips, give these a try.

review/summary: One of the healthier chips
review/text: Simple, uncomplicated and healthy ingredients. Cooked in expeller pressed oils (not heated to extract, which causes loss of nutritional value), Kettle chips have a firmer texture than most others, but they have great flavor, even though no flavor enhancers are used except for the spices. No preservatives is also a plus. My only negative experience with them is an occasional bag in which the chips in the very bottom of the bag are oily. I was so pleased to find them at a price nearly a third less than what I have been paying in the grocery market.

review/text: These are nothing more than barbecue potato chips.  Covered with a dusting of chili powder, salt, and sugar, I would not buy these again. I really love blue cheese, but I can't taste it in these chips. I should never buy anything I haven't tried, and now I'm stuck with all these bags of chips that I don't like. I have tried the salt and cracked pepper flavor and wish I had bought them instead.

review/summary: A salty, spicy crispy delight!
review/text: This flavor of Kettle chips is my favorite.  I always need to have a few of these bags laying around for a good movie or sporting event.  Krinkle cut happens to be my favorite type of chip and kettle chip delivers on these.  Not only are the chips always crispy and fresh, but they have a perfect coating of salt and pepper.<br /><br />That coating creates a nice blend of salt w/ a bit of nice black pepper kick that lets you know the chip is willing to give a bit of bite before surrendering.  I've gotten a few boxes of these over the past year and have had no problems with the chips or unbalanced flavoring.  Once again Kettle delivers a fantastic product that delights the taste buds

review/summary: Stale, too oily to touch and tasted weird
review/text: I ve had this exact kind a ton of times at my local deli and love their taste, figured i d save a bunch by getting a box of 24 delivered to my desk at work. Unfortunately, I think they unloaded their oldest/worst batch on me. The chips tasted stale, leached out a ton of oil ( I m not kidding, felt like I was eating pizza given how much oil i was leaching out with a napkin from each individual chip!) and the taste was just off. I think with all the oil that leached out, it upset the flavor balance of the chip and now they just taste really salty and stale.<br /><br />Tried 3 different bags, and it was the same in each case (couldnt eat more than a couple of chips, they were that bad). Got in touch with Amazon customer care, and they were kind enough to get me a refund, but i recommend that you save yourself the hassle and give these a miss.

review/summary: Taste good but NOT truly MSG-FREE
review/text: I bought 2 cases of these chips because I heard nothing but great things about this brand and this flavor of chip in particular. However, upon receiving them today, I saw that although they state NO MSG, they DO contain Yeast Extract which acts exactly as MSG does and therefore I cannot eat them. Unfortunately ALL Kettle chips contain this ingredient so I am unable to eat any of them. I don't think I can return them but I got them at a cheap price so I will donate them or see if Amazon can let me return them since the description was a bit misleading. These chips are MUCH healthier than many other brands, so if you are not MSG sensitive, I say dig in!

review/summary: Check the label
review/text: The fact that Kettle Foods claims their products are "All Natural" really, really, really upsets me. These chips, and many other Kettle chips, contain "yeast extract." On a chemical level, yeast extract is the same thing as MSG; it's just derived from a different source. Kettle labels some of their products with "NO MSG," but their reps say people who are sensitive to glutamates should avoid their products. Be an informed consumer.

Even if you do eat a whole one, it's better than being able to help yourself to seconds. They are easy and quick to make and taste great. Yes they cost more than buying a cake mix and making a whole cake but they take less time, no added ingredients other than water, and again, no left overs. I have been buying them since they came on the market and will continue as long as they make them. The variety lets you have a different dessert each day too.

review/text: I am still trying to figure out what kind of licorice the one bad reviewer is looking for, as I have been eating black licorice for 60 years and this is by far<br />the best to date.  My love of Molasses started from the days we used to hang around the milk farms and dip into the cow licks.  It is not the standard twisted type which stopped being good many years ago when they started bringing in the red and chocolate (of all things), and did away with the Molasses in the black.<br />This is black licorice, for the connoisseur that will only accept to best.<br />The bars are solid and I personally can only handle a couple at a time; no finishing<br />half a bag of twists like we used to.<br />This is not a light snack, but a full mouth experience.<br />It took me a few years to find this product. After being disappointed with hard twist licorice in the stores, I just stopped eating it for many years.

They no longer taste even vaguely like licorice, but rather like solid molasses, which is listed as one of the ingredients. Have shot Panda an irate online comment and predictably have not heard back. So, I have stopped eating Panda bars. (The upside: I've lost two pounds in a couple of weeks.) Licorice connoisseurs, let these penny pinchers know you notice the reduction/elimination of licorice extract from their products!

review/text: I love the Panda licorice bars because they are one solid piece without ridges or holes.  I can take a small bite and just suck on it for an hour like a lozenge.  Ounce for ounce, these Panda bars last me longer than any other kind of licorice.  Now that I live overseas in a country where black licorice isn't available, I really appreciate that these Panda black licorice bars can last me for such a long time.<br /><br />I've traveled the world, always making it a point to look for my favorite candy wherever I go.  I've tried local licorice from the U.S., Poland, Egypt, and best of all, Finland (where Panda is made).  Seriously, the Finns know how to make good licorice, and Panda is their best.<br /><br />I have loved black licorice since I was a little kid.  I can't remember when I first tried Panda's black licorice, but from the moment I did, it became my very favorite.

One day standing in line at the grocery I spotted the Panda licorice and decided to see what he thought of it. It was excellent! It is not too sweet, not too salty, isn't too hard or too soft. In short we found it to be perfect! I headed to my favorite place to shop (Amazon.com) and there it was by the box and at a much better price! Will definitely be back for more!

review/summary: Delish
review/text: A few weeks ago I found myself with a hankering for licorice.  Unfortunately I live in a small town in South Carolina, not exactly the kind of place where you'd expect to find a Trader Joe's or any other specialty foods store.  Once again, Amazon came through where brick & mortar options failed me.  I had tried Panda licorice before, in the form of little bite-size pieces.  But this 36-pack of man-size licorice sticks clearly had more to offer.  The moment I placed my order, I sensed that something had changed within me.  I felt bigger, stronger, perhaps even more virile than before.  The air smelled of new life, and every breath thereafter imbued me with a growing sense of adventure and vitality.  A few days later the licorice arrived at my house.  And then, the taste...  oh, the taste!  Like thousands of years of Eastern confectionery tradition condensed into a chewy brown stick, it was.  My eyes wide open in delighted surprise, I quickly turned the wrapper over to read the ingredient list.  Only four ingredients, each indispensable, each equal in importance, as the four ancient elements of creation itself.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning: The day after I ate that first licorice stick, I noticed that my chest hair was thicker, darker, more voluminous.  I'm no scientist or doctor, but I'm pretty sure this was a direct result of consuming that most manly of all confections, Panda licorice.  I highly recommend that you order a pack...  if you're man enough to handle it.

The bars are too thick and gummy and rather unpleasant to chew, and the licorice flavor is just not strong enough to counteract the overwhelming texture.  I love good licorice, and am sorry to say that this is just not it.

review/text: I love chocolate covered pretzels, and these are pretty good. The chocolate is above average quality for covered pretzels, but there isn't a heavy coating, which is a minus in my book. It's easy to eat the whole bag in one sitting.<br /><br />I have tried the dark chocolate variety but found those to be pretty tasteless, the milk chocolate definitely complements the pretzels. If they would just add a bit more chocolate coating they would get 5 stars.

review/summary: Very economical ounce for ounce compared to tubed wasabi
review/text: Exported from Japan, this is a very good "fake" wasabi powder (nearly all tubed and powdered wasabi is actually horseradish). 25g of powder is a lot, so this can will last you a long long time, making this a very economical choice for sushi lovers. I bought a tin of it 2 years ago and have still not gone through it all. To prepare, just mix with a bit of cold water and wait several minutes for the flavor to develop, then enjoy with sushi or sashimi. My directions are vague as to how much to use and how long to wait because the can's directions are not specific. Reconstituted, it's every bit as good as tubed wasabi. I find that a teaspoon of powder is more than sufficient for one person.<br /><br />Make only as much as you need and right before you are about to use it. The chemicals that give horseradish (and real wasabi) its pungency are very volatile and will dissipate quickly when exposed to air (15-30 mins). Don't think you'll save time by making a big batch of it and refrigerating it until next time. All you'll taste is a coarse paste of green goop.<br /><br />Be aware that the product description is **WRONG**. This is not an all natural product. Ingredients listed on the label: horseradish, mustard, Vitamin C, ascorbic acid, and artificial colors (Blue #1, Yellow #4). Blue #1 (Brilliant Blue FCF) is a commonly-used synthetic dye derived from petroleum. You can see it on the right side of the label in the photo if you read Japanese: chakushoku-ryou, coloring agent.<br /><br />Another excellent brand is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CNU1X">Hime Powdered Wasabi (Japanese Horseradish)</a>, or if you prefer it in a ready-to-use tube, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YGSAU">S&B - Wasabi in Plastic Tube (Family Size) 3.17 Oz.</a>, a very popular brand.

I do think some of the reviewers who likened the taste to potatoes might actually be referring to another variety of snack that Nong Shim makes, as they do produce several.  In any event, if you are not thrown by the somewhat french fry reminiscent shape, and you are not opposed to developing callouses on the roof of your mouth from possible excess consumption, these are definitely worth a try!

review/summary: nice twist on the original
review/text: I love plain cheerios but sometimes a little cheerio diversity is called for.  The banana nut flavor is not overly sweet and there is a distinctive banana taste, almost a slightly burnt banana taste.  I love pairing a bowl of these cheerios with so delicious coconut milk and sliced banana pieces.  The combination of the three easily keep me satiated from breakfast until lunch.  I occasionally mix this banana nut flavor with chocolate cheerios for an even sweeter, exceptional treat.<br /><br />While I do not find the banana nut flavor to be overly sweet, one should not overlook that sugar is the second ingredient for this food and, the sugar content is relatively high -- especially for frequent use by children.  Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar. So you have about 2 and 1/4 teaspoons in a single 3/4 cup serving of banana nut cheerios. With everything else your kids consume during the day, (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?), the sugar in this cereal may be high for frequent consumption. Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day. While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day, I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which, on the low end, would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end. If you child is getting 2 and 1/4 teaspoons with this cereal, your child has consumed a fair amount of sugar for the morning.<br /><br />When paired with fresh bananas, this cereal can be filling but if limiting sugar for your kids (or your own meals), you might want to use sparingly.

review/summary: Fun, light tasting, and yummy Cheerios
review/text: These are great (even though they can be pricey but they go on sale often enough!) They don't have a super strong banana flavor but it's just banana-y enough. They seem to stay fine in the milk (I hate soggy cereal) as long as you sit down and eat them right away. They are great for the kiddos to munch too as a snack in a baggy! My two and four year olds love them!

review/summary: Didn't Go Bananas Over the Flavor
review/text: Cheerios is a staple and a comfort food to all of us who grew up eating breakfast sitting in front of the TV while watching Ray Raynor. Or whatever classic children's programming they showed outside Chicago.<br /><br />Although you could always doctor up your bowl with sliced fruit, Apple Cheerios was a welcome addition to the General Mills product line. But sometimes it's better to quit while you're ahead.<br /><br />Now we have--Banana Nut Cheerios! This is not a good breakfast choice. For one thing, banana is really hard to artificially reproduce. I don't know why. But companies keep trying, and it's almost always a disaster. Things that taste like authentic bananas, ie, banana bread, use authentic bananas. I don't know who was involved in the marketing focus group for Banana Nut Cheerios, but maybe they were all having sinus issues that day and couldn't taste a thing.<br /><br />Banana Nut Cheerio tastes strongly of FAKE banana, which is worse than when a real banana gets all black on the outside and mushy on the inside. I couldn't taste the "nut" element because the fake banana was so overwhelming. And it was pervasive. It took forever for the aftertaste to go away.<br /><br />Even my dogs rejected a little Cheerio "treat" when we came in from our walk.<br /><br />No one in the family would eat more than one serving, so eventually we threw the nearly-full box away. It was funny because one of my co-workers told the EXACT same story about the Banana Nut Cheerios she bought for her family.<br /><br />So if you have little kids that have weird tastes  (and remember that some kids will even eat asphalt and laundry detergent, although I think that's a mineral deficiency) this might be okay. But for everyone else, stick with the original, or the apple flavor.<br /><br />At least, for your dog's sake.

review/text: First time I tried this cereal I had to fight off the family to get a second bowl. We love cheerios, and this flavor was so good that first time. We ordered these from Amazon and felt like we found a great deal. Every serving I had just got worse... these have a fake taste about them. Too sweet, it gets away from the cheerio taste. So people like the oat-ness, some people like frosted cheerios.

review/summary: Great cereal, don't buy it at Amazon
review/text: Love this cereal.  It has a great banana flavor (it's also great if you slice a banana in it) and is subtly sweet and nutty.  It stays reasonable well in milk, but needs to be eaten quickly.  The price @ Amazon is way too high since you can typically find Cheerios at the grocery store for ~2.00 a box.  This is a great alternative to normal cheerios for kids to eat dry too.

review/text: For some reason,  I'm guessing available shelf space vs sheer number of cheerios variety, my shoprite no longer sells the banana nut variety of cheerios. Some shoprites do but not mine...ANYWAY I absolutely LOVE these and was thrilled to be able to buy them on amazon at a really great price. This type cheerios costs more then other types I guess bananas cost more where cheerios are made or something. I highly recommend banana nut cheerios,  they are a great snack with no milk and they are also awesome with milk. I think my title says it all YUM YUM YUMMY YUM....Nuff said?

review/text: I usually test out boxes of cereal when they go on sale for cheap at the store before buying a subscription here and so I was pretty happy when the Banana Nut Cheerios were on sale last month. I bought a box to try out and was quite surprised at the great balance of flavor these had. The banana flavor is nice and light and you get a pleasant aftertaste of walnuts. It's light, refreshing, and a great new way to enjoy Cheerios. I will probably subscribe to this one!

This product is free from by-products like Nutro, uses great ingredients, and IT'S MADE IN THE USA.(Nutro is made in Canada).<br /><br />Our cat had some GI issues.  Nutro was the food that was working best with her system.  We switched to Diamond only after she started having hairballs.  The switch took a few days but now her litter box is not a mess after BM and no hairballs.  This is a great product and something Nutro users should consider.

review/text: I had been feeding my cats a so-called "quality" food for years, until I found out about all the by-products and other junk it had in it. I have since been experimenting with various premium brands to find one that my cats liked and that they didn't barf up every other day. I've finally found the winning formula with this food. They love it and their hairballs have been greatly reduced. But there have been some other effects I hadn't counted on. My oldest cat (12 years) is suddenly acting like a kitten again. My younger cat (10 years) has always had a difficult coat which is now silky and rarely mats. And through Amazon, this brand is less expensive than many other premium brands. Bonus!

review/summary: Finally-help for my cat's skin allergy!!!
review/text: I have been struggling for years to find a cat food that would relieve a stubborn skin allergy on one of my cats.  Finally after reading on a website (I'm sorry I don't remember which one), someone mentioned this food and I found it at my local Farm and Home Store (like a Southern States feed store).  I was really skeptical that this would work, but I was hopeful because the front of the bag said no wheat, corn or soy, plus it contains Omega 3 fatty acids.  Imagine my surprise when after one bag of this food, my cat's long-time allergy where he licked all the hair off his belly and caused little sores all over began to clear up.  For the first time since he was a kitten he has hair on his belly that is not the result of me breaking down and taking him to the vet for a cortisone shot - something I tried not to do often because it is not good for cats and can cause diabetes.  In addition to my main concern for getting my poor kitty feeling better, I was paying so much money for Prescription ZD diet from the vet's office and with five cats I had to isolate one cat to feed him while the others got the less expensive store brand.  Anyway - I'm just saying - after trying EVERYTHING I could think of - homepathic remedies, $$$ trips to vet, $$$ trips to cat dermatologist, and many $65 bags of ZD diet, this wonderful food has stopped the allergy and its lower cost means I can allow all five of my cats to eat it.  I know all allergies are different, but this belly licking behavior seems to be very common if the websites and comments I saw while research the problem are any indication.  Try this food - give it at least a full month before deciding if it works.  I am so thankful to have found this food.

review/summary: Probably caused crystals in urine
review/text: My cat developed crystals in his urine after he began eating this food.  He always eats high-quality dry food, such as Wellness, and he wasn't under any stress, so I believe that switching to this food caused the condition.  I took him off of this and put him back on Wellness dry food, and without any other changes in his diet or environment, the crystals went away after about two weeks.  Sure enough, I later contacted Diamond and they informed me that the ash content in this dry food is 8.8%, and the magnesium = .10%.  The lower the ash content, the higher the quality of the meat is.  To give you an idea of what an acceptable amount in dry food is, Wellness contains 6.5%.  I would stay away from Diamond Naturals if you have a male cat.

review/summary: Cats stopped eating it
review/text: I switched to this food in an effort to stop the daily vomiting with my six cats. They ate it for about a year with no problem. The vomiting decreased to almost nothing and most of the cats seemed healthy eating it, except one which started getting a bald spot on her back.<br /><br />Then, about a month ago, they stopped eating it. The same food sat for a week, so I dumped it and opened a new bag, thinking something had happened to that bag. Same results. I also realized that it had a smell I never noticed before, kind of musty or moldy, very unappetizing and it tainted some items I had in the pantry where the unopened bags were stored.<br /><br />I don't know if they changed the formula or if I got three contaminated bags, but I'm out $60+ because of it.

review/summary: Suspiciously Awesome for the Price
review/text: I have two fat and sassy cats that are not picky about what they eat. They prefer certain foods over others, and it was never more evident than when they were on Science Diet. One of my cats got a urinary tract infection and needed to switch to a urinary health food. My sister-in-law is a vet and we subsequently got several 26 lb bags at cost. It was still very expensive and the cats weren't too fond (they are brothers and refuse to eat seperately. We just gave up and gave it to both of them).<br /><br />After about a year of this we moved to Boston and sold our cars. Carrying bags of food was not a fun option. I had tinkered with very expensive all natural brands and slowly moved the cats over, monitoring their health with our local vet. If anything changed we had to switch back. After that success (and changing up their water bowl) I started looking for a cheaper, better alternative. This brand got great reviews. We purchased a bag and planned on switching them over slowly. They loved it so much that we sped up the process. Their coats are ridiculously shiny and they eat less of it and have stayed at a healthy weight. No urinary tract problems or serious hairball problems (our other one used to ralf every other day on our ottoman). I highly recommend this.

review/summary: My cats like it
review/text: This is about the cheapest "good" food you can get for you cats.  I went to pet food ratings . net and it's not listed, but the ingredients are similar to a lot of the much higher priced cat foods out there.  It has no meat by products,  no corn, no wheat, no brewers yeast, no artificial colors and has extra vitamins.  The biotin is nice for healthy coats and has helped my cat a lot.  They no longer get hair balls either after eating this.  The only real iffy thing I see is powdered cellulose being so high on the list of ingredients (supposedly this is use for hairball control though), but overall this is a good cat food.  There are better cat foods out there, but this is a nice medium for my budget (I feed stray feral cats too so it gets to be pricey) and a much better alternative to the horrible cat food from national brands in grocery stores.<br /><br />ETA after using for 2 months I have to say I like it more than ever.  I have a cat with some issues with losing hair and was told she had flea allergies.  Even with using flea treatments her hair would start to thin and she's scratch herself until she had sores on her neck.  After a using this food she's pretty much completely cured (and it works for hairballs so that's a plus).  I'm guessing it was more of a food allergy than a flea allergy now.  I'm very pleased with this food!

review/text: I have got through a handful of cat foods and this one seems to be one of the better options.  My cat can be picky, and though she doesn't always like natural or high end products this one is a hit.  She stopped vomiting (hairballs) just days after switching to diamond.  She has had a couple over the two months, but it is a noticeable decrease.  The cost per pound is great.  It gets me down to about ten dollars a month for food delivered to my doorstep.  I did have to purchase a container because the bag is too big and awkward for my kitchen, but this is hardly a fair complained for the product itself.  I can't think of anything bad to say.  Hope it works as well for you as me.

review/text: I have used Diamond dog food since the mid-80s when I was breeding and showing and field trialing Brittanies.  It was the best product on the market at that time, the only problem being that I had to drive from Houston, TX to Austin, TX to purchase it, since it had a small distributor pool.  It was well worth the drive (I bought in bulk).<br />I recently found they also make cat food.  I tried it several months ago and have been using it since.  I work with a cat rescue organization and consequently have several rescue kitties to feed.  EVERY CAT I FEED LOVES IT. Their coats are now glossy, soft and mat free. Every now and then, they do cough up a hairball, but that's better than impacting their intestines. They no longer throw up right after eating and their stools are firm, but not too hard.<br />My 13 year old cat(who has always had intestinal problems) is, while eating more, losing excess weight and no longer has loose, runny stools.<br />I FULLY RECOMMEND DIAMOND PRODUCTS.

review/summary: no more puking
review/text: I have three cats and few of them used to have hairball/puking issue, but this food has minimized the amount and number of pukes! They all seem to like the flavor as well. Also, for what I understand, the ingredients are one of the best out in the market.
