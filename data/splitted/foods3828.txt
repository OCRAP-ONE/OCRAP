review/text: Well I ordered the six pack of these and pretty much ate them all myself within a couple of weeks.  They are absolutely yummy.  I know, dried fruit has a "high glycemic index."  Ok, so control yourself, but still you can get your fruit easily this way.  This is a somewhat better price than I can get in my little local grocery store, and fresher from Amazon.  Keep them in your desk at work or the car!

review/summary: Healthy Treats for Small Dogs
review/text: I love these treats for my Jack Russell for three reasons;<br /><br />*Great Ingredients, no corn, wheat, or dairy. Just rice, meat, a little molasses, a little canola oil, and preserved with vitamin E. And not just alpha tocopherol...these treats have Mixed Tocopherols! If you know anything about vitamin E, you know it's a vitamin complex. The more parts of the complex that are included, the more healthy it is. The tocopherols are the things that help to preserve the product in a good natural way.<br /><br />*The size of these are really small, just a little over an inch. Shaped just like milkbones, they are a really cute mini version. And they break really easy, so I don't feel bad giving my little guy several pieces each day.<br /><br />*My dog loves these treats! I have to admit he's not picky, but it's still great that he loves such a healthy treat!<br /><br />And finally, my dog does not have food sensitivities or allergies, but if he did, these would still be a great choice!<br />When these are gone I will definitely buy more!

review/summary: Worst coffee I have purchased on Amazon ever, run, dont walk
review/text: I buy all my high end coffee on amazon. I have had great luck for years with organic and decaf whole bean coffee. When this came, it smelled wierd and we brewed and also tried expresso. This stuff is rank. Also, it is worth stating, it is near the exp. date. Amazon sent me more without asking if I wanted a refund, and it is bad too. I am going to ask for my money back. I can not afford to buy expensive organic coffee that is not drinkable. Please consider my review before wasting your money on this stuff

review/summary: Changed the Recipe - Tates Horrible Now
review/text: I have been an avid fan of these cookies for years.  My family went through dozens of boxes a month for our use, taking to functions as our donation, giving as gifts.  They were a dark, rich, wholesome, deep taste experience.  In May, 2012, I couldn't find them on the shelf in any of our normal stores.  After a few weeks, they were back.  I took them home and opened them and was surprised to find that the inside container was different.  It used to be three rows that ran the short end of the box.  Now it was two rows that ran the long end of the box.  No big deal had that been all that changed.  I took a cookie out and popped it in my mouth expected the same dark, rich, wholesome experience, and the cookie tasted so bad I almost threw up.  It was sickly sweet.  It tasted like a combination between an oreo and a health food bar.  All they did was move to the middle ground where those who like health food bars won't like the oreo sweet taste and those who like oreos won't like the health food bar taste.  They are awful.  And, I'm so sad, because before they changed the formulation, these were the best cookies on the market.  I turned so many people on to them.  Now that they changed the recipe, none of us will ever be buying them again.  They are now the worst cookie I have ever tasted.

review/summary: Product has changed
review/text: I fell in love with these cookies when I discovered them a few months ago, and wrote a positive review. I had them special ordered when I couldn't find them in the store anymore. Unfortunately, the order delivered to me was a completely different cookie. Late July changed the recipe, and they tasted awful. I emailed the company and they replied: "We did have to make some changes to our sandwich cookies, as we had to switch to new equipment which is a slightly different production process.  We are using the same ingredients but it is not exactly the same.  EXCEPT, to further complicate things we had an issue where, towards the end of the most recent production run, we moved to a new supply of our organic vanilla extract and have now come to learn that the concentration level was higher than we normally use.  We truly apologize for that which causes that sensation at the back of the mouth, liking a spicy or burning. The cookies are a little different in texture and taste, but pretty close without that extra vanilla extract. We did take the opportunity to make some improvements to the base cookie, with a better texture and increased the whole grains and reduced the saturated fat in the cookie. I'm sorry you are disappointed; but it was an equipment change we had to make.  Although we realize you may not like the new version, in addition to your refund I would like to send you a coupon to get a free box so that you may try them as they are intended to taste." So, I am awaiting my refund, and plan to try the cookie again later to see if it tastes better without the vanilla problem.

review/summary: Had to downgrade my original review because of declining quality.
review/text: These artichoke hearts have a nice flavor and are a pretty good value, but there are some very tough leaves in every can.  Like the kind you really would rather not try to chew and swallow.  I use these artichokes for everyday dinners, but would not serve them to guests.<br /><br />June 2012 Update:<br /><br />Over the long span of time that I had these artichoke hearts set up for auto-shipments, the quality continued to decline. The last shipment I received contained product so tough that it was literally inedible.  Imagine trying to chew thinly sliced bamboo and you'll get the idea.  My husband asked me not to serve them again, and I threw away what remained of the case.<br /><br />So I've cancelled my subscription to the Reese Artichoke Hearts and lowered my rating to one star. Food that can't actually be eaten isn't a bargain at any price.

review/text: I discovered these years ago and love them in many dishes, varying from homemade pizzas to wraps to chicken bakes and salads!  The only thing is that you have to make sure to RINSE THEM WELL before using or else they taste salty.  I put mine in a collander and rinse for several minutes before adding to a dish.  Great for keeping in the pantry for adding veggies to a dish when you don't have fresh ones on-hand!

Two are pretty filling, too.<br /><br />But, they cost a bit more (not less) than regular Pop-Tarts (they are 6-count vs. 8-count per box)and their ingredients are just about identical nutritionally.  They may be "organic" (whatever that means), but they have just as much sugar, fat, calories, you name it.<br /><br />But, did I mention they are delicious?<br /><br />I'll still be buying my favorite Pop-Tarts, but these will be on my list as well.

review/text: At the time of this review, Zevia Grape is not currently available for purchase on Amazon. I stumbled across the new flavor while shopping at my local WF store. Grape is easily one of Zevia's best varieties. They nailed the taste and you'll love drinking it.

review/summary: I can enjoy soda again this summer! This really is a nice grape flavor soda pop, even for stevia haters (like me)!
review/text: I want to say up front that I hate the taste of stevia. I tried it years ago when it first became the natural sweetener to try. I gagged. I tried it again in its updated "better" offerings. Still don't like it. Not even the popular Truvia could win me over.<br /><br />But it's getting to be summer, and though I mostly drink water/coffee/tea/coconut milk, I wanted a nice summery change of taste without calories or sugar or aspartame. So, yeah, I tried this.<br /><br />I decided to check out the grape first, as that one got consistently good reviews in the websites/blogs I visited to see what folks are saying. I got it today.<br /><br />I'm drinking it now WARM (arrived at my Miami doorstep 15 mins ago, so imagine it's not anywhere near cool here). I figured I'd taste it and, if I didn't like it, not bother to have it take up precious space in my crowded-with-produce fridge. I had a worry that my stevia-repulsed tastebuds would yell, yet again.<br /><br />Well, blow me down with a carbonated breath! This is GOOD! So good, I decided to come on and review it positively.<br /><br />I'm guessing the major lifting work of sweetening is being done by the erythritol (which I've had in stuff before and never bothered me, though I did sense the cooling effect). That's fine by me. I don't get weird rumbly tums from erythritol, and it's never had any funky effect on me like some report with aspartame.<br /><br />So, hey, I have a summer soda pop! I'm gonna order a six-pack of various other flavors to see if they measure up. The grape definitely measures up. And I'm even enjoying it WARM. :) I can't wait to see how it is fully chilled.<br /><br />And I appreciate that it doesn't have weird purple coloring. It's a clear fizzy liquid in my cup. I hate weird colored sodas.<br /><br />Thanks, Zevia. Nice grapey treat.

review/text: CAUTION...DO NOT use ice cubes in any Zevia soda.<br />I am hooked on Zevia sodas because their tastes are not "heavy." Each flavored soda seems to have just the right amount of taste. Once you add ice, the taste seems to get watered down.<br />Zevia is my new soda of choice.

review/summary: Even My Meat and Potatoes Husband Drinks These!
review/text: I bought these for my husband at WF, because he is supposed to stay away from sugary soft drinks and fruit juices.  We've tried a bunch of sugar free beverages, and this one has been the best. My husband is a meat and potatoes guy who is not interested in any diet-beverages, so getting him to try and then to regularly drink a 0-calorie beverage is a huge deal.  He likes the Zevia and asked me to get more of them - yipeeee!  He is going to be so much healthier, so I'm happy.

review/text: I think Zevia rocks period so maybe I am biased but whatever :)<br />This is my favorite flavor they have. Tastes just like regular grape soda minus the 76 grams of sugar/hfcs, artificial flavors and colors. I was honestly a bit shocked as to how good it tasted.<br />Love the fact that it is not purple either, rad.<br />Certified vegan to top it off, can't go wrong.

review/text: I grew up in an exclusively diet cola home.  I got to nearly hate diet soda... uhg..  Even now, I would rather drink water to "real" OR diet soda.  I loved to sneak sugary grape soda as a child, however.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think diet grape soda even existed when I was a youngster.<br /><br />This stuff takes me back to the forbidden treat of my past.  It even smells the same.  If you grew up, like me, loving grape soda, try this product.  You won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Zevia's Best flavor, hands down
review/text: I've always been a fan of grape soda, but I never drank it that much compared to the colas.  Mostly because my favorite was "Nehi Grape" and it was super difficult to find.  Harder to find than TAB, even.  Fast forward maybe 15 years, Zevia comes out with Zevia Grape and it's awesome.<br /><br />It has a very similar flavor to Nehi Grape, but with stevia instead.  It's a little on the sweet side, but not hypersweet or bitter like some of their other flavors (mountain zevia and grapefruit citrus/ginger ale, respectively).  This is a by far my favorite zevia flavor in their lineup of sodas; and it's close to perfect.<br /><br />One final note: I want to say is that this is a fakegrape flavor, and although it is pleasant, it resembles nothing to grape juice whatsoever.

review/summary: Manhood Tea, Health King promotes false advertisement in which they could be sued.
review/text: Manhood Tea claims to contain the herb or made of broomrape (cistanchis herba)(Rou Cong Rong- supports the kidneys) which it does not contain!  It's described as having made of broomrape (cistanchis herba) in it but the side of the box doesn't list it and I called Health King three years ago to ask why they no longer have the broomrape (cistanchis herba) in the tea and they said broomrape is an endangered plant species and by law they cannot put it in Manhood Tea so I asked them why they continue to advertise that Manhood Tea contains broomrape and they wouldn't give me an answer.<br /><br />One is better off buying another product like the single herb Panax Ginseng which helps all of the body as an adaptogen verses not really knowing what Health King puts in their tea as they would not give me a list of ingredients by percentage so this makes me think that many of the other herbs listed in Manhood Tea may also not be in it and it's just more false advertisement.  This is a low down trick the company plays and I'd think some lawyer would want to make some money off from false advertisement and someone probably will in the future.

review/summary: Not good.
review/text: If you even like this product...the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top. I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking. It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't. With the sweetness of the fig, a bit more acidity would have balanced it out. I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable. I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help. It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months. I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain. I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste. Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store. I asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller. I can see why.

review/summary: No Need to Duck This Treat
review/text: In the four ounce package are fourteen wraps, chunks of dried sweet potato wrapped in what looks like duck jerky. Inside the package is a small package of moisture absorber, a desiccant, not the kind of addition one normally finds in a food product, pet food or otherwise. The wraps aren't visually appealing to a human, but dogs will only be concerned with the scent and the taste. On the top of the pouch is a tear off strip to open it. A resealable plastic zipper seals the pouch tightly to keep the wraps fresh.<br /><br />Our three girls wear their emotions on their paws and their faces. Thus when each was presented with a duck sweet potato wrap their interest and their excitement were unmistakable. There were no sniffy-sniffy hesitations, no circle walkings, no signs of disinterest and definitely no looks of can't youdobetterthan this. Evie immediately grabbed her wrap between her jaws and began chewing, oblivious to the world. Piper and Bella, the two shih tzus, grabbed their wraps eagerly and slunk off to their respective corners for some private feasting. Piper in particular had a primal transformation, guarding her prize with laid-back ears and a low, stay away growl, hovering over her wrap like a miniature wolf guarding its kill. All three dogs were in a state of ravenous "wrapture" with their treats.<br /><br />I like that these wraps are too chewy for the dogs to finish off quickly, though Evie the vac nonterrier finished hers in half the time as her two little sisters. The duck jerky was eaten first, followed by the sweet potato piece with no lessening of interest or enjoyment. Of all the many treats and chews offered to this canine triumvirate, few have elicited such intense enthusiasm and prehistoric passion.<br /><br />We noticed no ill side effects in any of the pooches from these treats. There were no upset tummies, and no bouts of diarrhea. The verdict of this jury was unanimous and definitively pawsitive.

review/text: Poodle is very itchy sometimes, so I try to buy him treats that are as hypoallergenic as possible. He likes these duck treats. They are each 2 to 3 inches long, they are somewhat chewy and tough but he enjoys that. I usually will put one in a treat puzzle for him. It is made in China, which people worry about, I recommend checking out dogfoodadvisor.com for some information on that; apparently almost all dog food sold in the US still sources some ingredients from China. Poodle is 16 lbs and has had no trouble with them. This is also a much better deal than the package I bought in my local pet store, FYI.

review/summary: Great treats and Great service
review/text: This is a great alternative to the normal treats.  We have a dog that is allergic to grains and this is something that she thinks is yummy and we can give her without worrying about a reaction.  If you are having trouble with your dog's skin ( or a licking problem) check out their diet.  When we switched the response was quick, but we still needed a treat to give out daily, and the sweet potato duck wraps really filled the bill.

review/summary: DO NOT FEED YOUR DOG THIS PRODUCT !
review/text: The Sweet Potato and Duck Wrap has been specifically named in the latest FDA report as one of the dog treats that is unsafe to give your dog.  Please read the latest report yourself.  I also recommend a Facebook page "Animal Parents Against Pet Treats and Food Made in China" that list the facts on the brands that are considered to be unsafe. The CADET brand is named in the complaint. I have always bought my pet treats from the RAWHIDE DEPOT vendor on AMAZON, and have ordered the CADET brands...unaware that most CADET dog treats were sourced from China.  I will continue to order from RAWHIDE DEPOT.  I have gotten excellent service with them.  However, I will not order the CADET brand of dog treats again.

Duck has a fairly low reaction level<br />to allergy prone animals, as well.  What a nice little change for him; & he LOVES<br />these so much, he gobbles them right up.

review/text: I started buying these treats years ago thinking they looked cute with the little bone and chicken piece wrapped around them.  I did not realize I would be buying them constantly as my two golden's just love these.  I keep them in a ceramic treat jar on the counter and as soon as the lid is lifted and a slight noise made; they are both sitting there waiting looking at me.  I can go thru a jar of these in two weeks if I don't ration them out.  The dogs love them, they are probably healthier for them than grocery store biscuits and every once in awhile they are on sale.  Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: Results vary for Hot Air Poppers
review/text: some good results some bad..., October 16, 2009<br />By  V. Sandy "V" (Prescott,AZ) - See all my reviews<br /><br />Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)<br />I bought the 12 bottle variety to try out. I just recently started using a hot air popper so wanted to see what varieties worked well.<br /><br />First off. The baby white and baby yellow kernels are just too light for use in a hot air popper. We did pop them at work using a traditional popper and they were fine.<br /><br />The are two varieties that stood out as my favorites for my hot air popper. The first is the Wisconsin White Birch, which popped up big, fluffy and close to zero unpopped or blow out kernels. The second is Savannah Gold, it popped up big, nice volume and again almost zero unpopped or blow out kernels.<br /><br />Two varieties that are close seconds as favorites are: Autumn Blaze Blend (small, crisp, no unpopped kernels but quite a few blow outs) and High Mountain Midnight (some no pops, good volume).<br /><br />There was only one variety that I would not ever use again. The Black Hills had about 4 times the quantity of unpopped kernels as any of the other types, the kernels popped up very small, it was extremely hully and some kernels burnt in the hot air popper.<br /><br />Orchard Blossom, Red River Valley and Harvest Blend types all popped fine in my hot air popper with only a few unpopped kernels. The Blue Heron also popped fine with a few more unpopped kernels than the three mentioned in the sentence before; it was also earthy in taste and popped up small kernels. Savannah Fire had very few close to no pops and was very chewy without being hully.

review/summary: Best Popcorn I've ever had!
review/text: ever since I started buying Fireworks popcorn I have wanted to eat popcorn every day. So far, I have tried three flavors: Wisconsin White Birch, Savanna Gold, and Autumn Blaze. ALL three were AMAZING! They all pop-up different sizes, but that's what makes them so much better than any regular popcorn you get in the store. Savanna Gold has an almost buttery flavor right away after it is popped, and pops up large. Autumn blaze pops very small, and is nearly hull-less (I'm guessing there are some baby white rice kernels mixed in with some other small varieties, but I haven't tried the baby white rice yet), and it is amazing. The kernels are tender and yummy.  The Wisconsin White Birch is a really good popcorn also, but I usually mix it with Savanna gold to make a good mixture of flavors. I have purchased all the flavors, and will trying the rest shortly. I pop them in a stir crazy popper, and it usually pops almost all of the corn. Rarely are there many un-popped seeds. I highly suggest these three flavors, and I'm sure I'd suggest the rest once I try them. If you love to eat popcorn you'll love fireworks popcorn.

review/summary: Not quite magic, but close!
review/text: My mother is a huge believer in home remedies, in herbs and plants to help soothe away your aches and pains. Burn your hand? Break off a bit of the aloe plant. Stomach ache? A soothing tea made of sarsaparilla root (which is apparently kinda dangerous...oops). My minor in college was Folklore, and I love this kind of stuff, different plants that supposedly help with different aches...I've seen it firsthand in my wife. She gets crazy bad migraines, and a good cup of mint tea can help her keep things under control. But I love the Red Leaf Teas website, especially their matchas, that list everything the plant involved in the flavoring can do. Take this tea for instance:<br /><br />Did you know that studies showed that pomegranate juice destroys breast cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone? It may also prevent breast cancer cells from forming.<br />Pomegranates also offer the following benefits to list a few :<br />Lung Cancer Prevention<br />Slows Prostate Cancer<br />Keeps PSA Levels Stable<br />Protects the Neonatal Brain<br />Prevention of Osteoarthritis<br />Protects the Arteries<br />Alzheimer's Disease Prevention<br />Lowers Cholesterol<br />Lowers Blood Pressure<br />Dental Protection<br />taken from the Red Leaf Teas website.<br /><br />Now, part of me just brushes most of that off, but the part of me that is my mother's hippie daughter drinks this matcha just in case. My aunt recently started chemo to deal with her breast cancer, and one of the things that helped speed up the end of my grandmother's life was breast cancer, so I don't mess around with it. If there's even a slight possibility something might help prevent breast cancer in my body, I'm there. I've already had that scare once, so it's not something I take lightly. And pomegranates are just a good idea all around. If I can get that great, juicy pomegranate flavor without having to deal with the hassle of getting in to an actual pomegranate, even better.<br /><br />The smell is wonderful. Nice and strong and juicy, I can already taste the delicious smoothies that will come from this. But I'm moving away from the smoothies more and more, as I used to think the only way I would enjoy matcha would be in a smoothie and I have since learned that that is decidedly not true. I'm on my third cup today!<br /><br />I don't know how to describe the taste other than juicy, which I feel like I've been using too much lately. But it's true! All of the fruit blends I've had from Red Leaf Tea have been juicy! This one especially...and I can just see a Matcha Pomtini in my future. Or mix this with a little orange juice? Yum. This tea is definitely one I want to spend a bit of quality time with.

review/text: I can eat a trough of sunflower seeds in a weekend but dont like how the salt makes my hands swell or my wii fit asking why i gained weight in a snotty tone. So i bought these roasted but unsalted seeds. They are pretty good, some of the seeds are very good, i just miss the salt. I havent found any other roasted unsalted seeds so i will continue to buy these. The shipping is as much as the seeds cost so thats a bummer. I am considering buying raw seeds in the shell at Sprouts and just roast them and lightly salt them myself.
