review/text: I usually drink about twelve 12 oz Coke Zeros a day, however the aspartame is bad for your diet.  Diet colas are worse for you than regular colas.  So I switched to 5 Hour Energy to replace the caffeine.  I also have Crohn's Disease.  This disease causes me to have a Vitamin B12 deficiency, which I normally have to buy and give myself an injection for.  Not anymore.  5 Hour Energy gives me 8333% (not a typo) of my daily allowance for B12, and also provides another crucial element that my body has a difficult time getting - Folic Acid.  Both of these are essential to the human body.  So, not only do I get jacked up from the 5 Hour Energy, it counters some of the effects of my Crohn's Disease by providing me with crucial elements and energy that otherwise are drained by this disease.  I am not a doctor, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, and drank 5 Hour Energy while I was there.

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised
review/text: First, let me say that I until trying 5 Hour Energy, I'd never tried any of the energy drinks on the market.  My main reason for not trying any of them was simple - most provide their "energy" boost from high levels of sugar or high-frutose corn syrup and caffeine.  Not trying to make a sweeping generalization here, and like I said, I haven't tried them - but I am an avid label-reader.<br /><br />I was in a convenience store one day and happened to pick up a bottle of 5 Hour Energy and read the label.  I was surprised that the ingredients were high in vitamins and amino acids.  But, I'm not one to try every "miracle in a bottle" product on the market and tend to be rather cynical when it comes to most of them, so I didn't buy any, but I was definitely intrigued.<br /><br />But here's the other thing.  I have MS and Fibromyalgia.  So as a result I deal with extreme levels of fatigue every day, and I'm talking about mind-numbing, like you can't even lift your head off the pillow, debilitating fatigue.  So quite honestly, I seriously doubted that ANY energy drink was going to have much of an affect on me.<br /><br />But one day, at another convenience store, I thought what the heck I'll give it a try, and bought 2 bottles.  When I got home, I drank half a bottle.  Within minutes, I felt better, like the 5 hour had taken the edge off my typical "my batteries are completely drained" feeling.  My initial reaction was that the sensation was purely a psychological placebo-effect sort of thing.  A little while later, I drank the rest of the bottle.  I still wasn't exactly convinced, but at the same time was thinking "wow, what if this stuff really works!".<br /><br />That evening I could feel myself starting to fade again. Not at all unusual for me after about 6 or 7, and when it happens, I'm usually worthless for the rest of the night.  Then I remembered that I had another bottle.  I know that they recommend no more than 2 bottles a day, but I had to know if what I had experienced earlier was the real deal or not.  So, I drank the second bottle.  Again, within a couple minutes I could feel my energy level rebound.<br /><br />Have to admit, that while this stuff isn't a magic potion, for me at least, it does what it claims.

When I can't nap because of committments, and know I will get very sleepy - this energy drink keeps me awake without the jitters from coffee.

review/summary: fast acting wake up call
review/text: Great product , I've been an avid fun of hydroxycut hardcore from muscle tech for many years now. I have been also exposed to ephedrine for quite some time. I have a pretty high tolerance for most of energy drinks and being a 290 pounds athlete I require larger amounts of energy to get me going. I found 5H energy to actually work quite well. Make SURE to have 2H window between ur last meal and the time u drink ur energy shootl . Empty stomach is the most desireable environment for ur 5H energy shoot to kick in and in my case it does; within 5 min I already feel the surge of energy that continues for hours to come. Awake , alert , NO shivering heart palpitation trembling or similar effects.

review/summary: Gives the kick you need
review/text: 5 hour energy drink definitely works I have not experienced any side effects. Also it doesn't taste that bad for anyone to gag on it. That's definitely exaggerating. Within minutes of taking 5 hr energy drink my thinking is increased, I'm totally awake and I just feel so aware.  It's definitely great when you have to get up for work everyday at 5am and get home about 7pm.  I'm definitely not a morning person, but this helps me.  It's great for working out because it gives you that increased energy to actually get up off the couch and workout.  But there are some things you should remember. Try not to take on an empty stomach, because this drink increases your energy and your body needs something to burn to fuel that energy.  Another thing is only drink half of the bottle.  Why? because a whole bottle will have your hands shaking and your heart beating really fast.  I learned this the hard way. Maybe it's just my body that couldn't take the whole bottle, but to be on the safe side drink only half and see how you feel and if it's not enough then drink the other half.  I find that a half a bottle gets me through the whole day until I get ready to go to sleep that night.

Couple days later I am busy in the kitchen and feeling run down.  I drank a bottle of 5 hr. Energy and layed down for a few minutes thinking of catching a small nap.  To my surprise I lie there about 15 min. and felt pretty good so I got up and went back to the kitchen and finished what I was doing and cooked something else also.

review/summary: Worked for me!
review/text: I had to drive 500 miles and the drive began late in the day when I was already tired and on a full stomach from lunch.  Needless to say I was feeling a bit drowsy.  A friend of mine suggested I try the 5 Hour Energy, and incredibly, I was wide eyed and alert for the entire drive.  The next day, I had to drive another 500 miles, and while it began earlier, I had a hard time sleeping.  Maybe it was the effects of the 5 Hour Energy still affecting me, or maybe it was because of the loud noises at my hotel.  Either way, I only had about 5 hours of rest, and I needed to cover 500 miles.  So I drank a bottle at the beginning of my drive and sure enough, I made it the entire way.  This is incredible for me as I have sleep apnea and although being treated with a CPAP machine, I still suffer from loss of energy throughout the day.  This has been the ONLY product that keeps me alert.  I do wonder what the health risks if any are though.

review/summary: Wonderful stuff!
review/text: I am very leery of "energy drinks." I have never tried Red Bull or Rockstar, and I really don't plan on it either. The thought of pumping myself with artificial energy (sugar and caffeine) and then crashing hard is just not very appealing to me. So, I was likewise hesitant with 5-hour Energy.<br /><br />After hearing all of the radio ads, though, and constantly seeing these little red bottles on the gas station counters, I had to give it a shot. I kind of coughed it down the first time as the flavor wasn't real great to me, but I figured it was only 2 ounces and I could get it down. I'm sure glad I did, because I was amazed at what it did for me. Using vitamins and minerals (and the same caffeine dose as in a cup of coffee), I was given energy that lasted and did not cause me to crash!<br /><br />I try to keep some of this stuff on hand (berry is my favorite by the way) and I usually take this when I am feeling like I really need a nap but the nap isn't an option. While it doesn't instantaneously feel like leaping off roofs, if I can motivate myself to start some project, within a half an hour I notice I am not tired anymore! This energetic (and non-sleepy) feeling last for quite a while too, so I don't take this beyond perhaps 4 or 5pm if I want to get to sleep that night.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many people I have gotten started on this. Usually it starts with something like this: Them--"Does that stuff really work?" Me--"Yes! It's awesome, and it isn't like most energy drinks. This is really vitamins. Here, try this!" Them (two weeks later)--"Wow! That stuff really does work. I have been buying it now!"<br /><br />This is highly recommended for safe and healthy pick-me-ups! (Can I give it 10 stars?)

review/text: I am VERY sensitive to Caffeine. It can send me into a full blown anxiety attack.  This product, for some reason had NO adverse effects for me.  If this is usually an issue for you, I would suggest trying 1/2 a bottle and seeing how you tolerate it.  I had energy.  Since it has B12 vitamins in it, my mood was also enhanced. I felt excited and energetic.  The berry flavor tastes like Crystal Light Pink Lemonade.  Almost exactly like that.  There was no crash AND I was able to sleep well that night.  Sound too good to be true!? It was for me. I am SERIOUSLY trying to resist the urge to stock up and buy a whole case.  This stuff is great.  I was in a show with someone who had trouble focusing, was moody and forgetful.  We were on stage and he was often a mess... One night he did an amazing job, and I asked him what was different... He said... I took a 5 Hour Energy drink.  I was stunned and still not convinced... but saw the drink in a store and had to try it.  WOW!  That is all I can say! WOW! It's great!!!

review/text: Dear Five-Hour-Energy (Berry Flavored),<br /><br />You came into my life when I was not ready for you.  I was still in a love-hate relationship with another woman, Coffee.  I loved Coffee's black taste, her bitter aroma, and her warm awakening after missing her for so long.  But she was not the one for me, my nights with her left me shaking, heart furious.  I felt manic and trapped.  My body would crash after tasting Coffee and my mind would race, too busy spinning to do anything useful.<br /><br />Then you came into my life, my sweet 5-Hour-Energy.  Coffee had stormed out, made a big scene at the cafe.  I met you at a gas station, looking alone and forlorn.  I asked you out to a club, and we danced all night long.  Later, I took you to rock climbing, swimming, kayaking.  My heart swelled with joy but you never made it hurt.  As our relationship prolonged, we sat with each other, working, sometimes writing tender missives.  My mind was alert, never spun thoughtlessly.<br /><br />Oh my love, I'd love to love you 5 hours more, my 5-Hour-Energy.<br /><br />Love,<br />Charlie<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- works!  you do get energy!<br />- minimal crashes (only occurs when i partake TOO excessively)<br />- berry flavor is tasty<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- there's a lot of vitamin B in this.  don't know if that is good or bad.<br />- can develop an immunity if you drink two or more every day, so don't do that<br /><br />As always, don't overdo any caffeine product.  If your body does not respond well to this product, cease immediately and maybe ask your doctor.  And then tell me if there are health risks.  Because I am not a doctor.  I am a warrior poet.  If by warrior, one thinks of programmers.

Difference is so obvious I really did get extra energy and power to shave off 2-3 minutes of my 5 mile morning run before annoying work day, as a matter of fact I still had gas in the tank to go another 4-5 miles if I had time. Same thing when I do road cycling specially 30-40milers, after 20 mile ride I take a shot of 5 hour energy and  double my distance.

review/text: This product is great and you get what the ads tell you about this product. You can definitely get through hours where you are extremely tired. Usually take it either in the afternoon to get through the rest of the day; small sip before a workout, half a bottle around 10PM when going out during the weekend. This product has a bit of an intense flavor - overall all of them do, so have some water ready as a chaser. This product will get you to a state like when you slept 10 hours and are bright awake and alert, however you wont have the jitters, shaky hands or anything like it. After the 5-6 hours it slowly fades away and you literally get back to the state you were at before taking this product - so there is no crash or anything. Aside from that your body will just extract this product after a bathroom run - it is not based on caffeine or taurine it actually works based on insane amounts of Vitamin B6 and B12 - one of them is at 8000% of your DV for food intake. Personally I have had great experience with it; though I have heard from people that they end up having to visit the bathroom due to some digestive issues.

review/summary: Other energy drinks don't work for you?  Try a bottle of 5-hour
review/text: First, as other reviewers here have already done, i want to emphasize that different bodies react differently to products such as this.  These are my own experiences with the products, and your mileage may vary.<br /><br />For this reason, I would encourage people try try a bottle at a local store (sold just about everywhere) before buying 12-pack's from amazon.<br /><br />Experiences with other products -<br />I drink coffee out of habit, but it doesn't help me to stay awake.<br />Instead, it makes me jittery and occasionally sick in the stomach.<br />Soda makes me bloated and deathly sleepy within minutes.<br />Energy drinks (monster, amp) makes me alert, but not at all focused.  The effect doesn't last more than a hour and the drink makes my stomach bloated and my body tense.<br /><br />5-hour energy -<br />The first thing that will hit you is the sourness, as if you're sucking on a lemon or warhead(though not as strong).  The sourness jolts me right up and then immediately after, it turns sweet and leaves no aftertaste.<br />It gets rid of the sleepy (the in-your-head, eyelids closing, can't stay awake kind of sleepy).. but doesn't really fix tiredness or exhaustion.<br />The thing I like best about this product is the -lack of- side effects.  Doesn't make my body tense or jittery, doesn't make me bloated or sick, doesn't make me more sleepy or crash.<br /><br />Does it really last 5 hours?  I've never tried chugging the whole thing.<br />I keep one in my bag and take a sip when needed.  It usually keeps me happy and productive for a day or two.<br /><br />The taste isn't bad at all imo.. call me crazy but i actually really like it.  Lemon-lime being my favorite, followed by pomegranate and berry.<br /><br />Price - yes, the drink isn't cheap.<br />BUT, the price is similar for any energy drink and i think that the price of this product is way overstated because you're getting a 2oz bottle instead of a 16oz can.<br /><br />However, for it's intended purpose (keeping you awake, not hydrated), (and if it works for you)i see it as a better deal for lasting longer, also I like the small pocket-able size.

They're all fine. After all, it doesn't take much more than a shot or less to do the trick, so the taste isn't that big of a deal. What's important is the "clean energy" without the plunge, addiction, stains or breath of coffee.

review/summary: I thought 5-hour energy was a scam until I tried it. It's unreal.
review/text: I'll be honest, I was a total skeptic of 5-hour energy for a LONG time. The TV ads seemed like a scam, no one I knew had tried them, and I just didn't buy into their marketing. Sure enough, I was browsing Amazon late at night one evening and decided to just try a box out. Why not, right? All I can say, is that these are unreal. Straight up. I don't know what else to say. I'm actually still trying to figure out how these are legal and the boost is amazing. Everything they claim is fact. There are not jittery feelings, no crash. The only thing they don't tell you is that the boost is so great that you'll want them all the time and they aren't cheap.<br /><br />Granted, I don't take these during the day at work - I'm a tea drinker and that keeps me going. When I head to go play basketball after work (3-4 times a week) I take one 15 minutes before I play. There is a noticeable difference in my energy levels out there when I have one, and when I do not. After a week of trying them out I was hooked. I'm an Ironman triathlete and consider myself to be in great cardio shape - knowing the performance edge that I seem to get from these, I would definitely use them on race day and again, can't say enough about the energy boost that accompanies these things.<br /><br />Anyway, you may not see a huge difference if you're sitting at your desk and take one - Honestly, I have no idea, I've just never used them that way. But...if you're going to work out, going on a run, going to play basketball or something to that effect, take one...and I think you'll be sold.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you'll need to sell your liver on eBay to sustain your habit...they are not cheap.

review/text: I hate coffee so I love 5 Hour Energy.  I also hate paying 3 or 4 bucks at stores here and there for it so this is very economical.  I usually put one in my TSA approved quart size bag so when I am on business trips, I can have it with me for meetings.

review/text: Can't rate this stuff highly enough, does as advertised, no let down as with sugar/caffeinated drinks.  There doesn't seem to be any addictive tendencies with 5-H-E which is nice.  I do not use this every day, great when driving to keep you alert behind the wheel.  Definitely the shizz.  Buy it.  Try it.

review/text: This is the 3rd time ordering 5-Hour Energy through Amazon.  I use this almost every day, probably a bit too much but is great for a boost of energy at work and doesn't give me the jitters.  Buying bulk like this makes it just under $2/bottle as long as you get free shipping which ALL STAR HEALTH offers and the order doesn't have to be $25 or more either! JUST MAKE SURE YOU DON'T USE THE DEFAULT SELLER FOR THIS ITEM.  EVERY TIME I FORGET TO ORDER THIS THROUGH ALL STAR HEALTH IT TAKES TWICE AS LONG TO RECEIVE.  ALL STAR HEALTH WILL PROCESS AND SHIP THE VERY NEXT DAY USING UPS AND THE DEFAULT (AMAZON) TAKES 3 DAYS TO PROCESS, THEN SHIPS VIA USPS (SNAIL MAIL).  USING ALL STAR HEALTH I HAVE ORDERED ON A SUNDAY AND ACTUALLY RECEIVED ON A TUESDAY WITH STANDARD (FREE) SHIPPING.

review/summary: Works almost too good
review/text: I had always seen the commercials for these energy drinks, and being the skeptic I am never really paid them any attention. One of my friends came back from college over winter break and he drinks them quite often, so I figured why not give them a try.<br /><br />These things work well, almost too well really. I've been taking them because during the week between school and work I average about 5-6 hours of sleep. When the commercial says feel it in minutes, they were not lying. It gets me going so much it almost feels like I've taken (illicit) drugs. I have a hard time sitting still in class these are so powerful.<br /><br />I will note that some people seem to get nothing from these, so before you go out and buy 24 bottles I'd say head to a gas station and pick one up for about 3 bucks. Also, energy lovers out there who have a Costco membership, you can get a pack of 24 for about 36 dollars before tax, and skip out on the shipping time.

review/summary: Excellent Product!
review/text: This drink delivers exactly what it promises. You get the energy boost you need without the side effects of a caffeine or sugar overload, which means you also don't get the crash when it wears off.  However, I would recommend taking it in small doses.  When I drink an entire bottle at once I get an immediate rush that eventually tapers off a bit and keeps me going for 5-6 hours.  However, it also makes me a little queasy.  I've gotten much better results by sipping on a bottle all day.  I sip about 1/4 quarter of the bottle every 2 hours.  This keeps me going all day without getting that upset stomach feeling. Highly recommended.

review/text: For the longest time my husband drank Red Bull to give him that buzz. But it's always short lived so he always brought a few to work. This one seems to be working for him. Obviously it's much smaller than a Red Bull but it gives you more boost. Not 5 hours as advertised but at least a bit longer than Red bull. He likes the taste too.

review/summary: Beats The Afternoon Crash! 8 )
review/text: I don't know about ya'll; but I work in an office and right between 2:00 -3:30, I experience an almost daily crash.  Really sleepy and lethargic, no focus.  This stuff usually does the trick.  One minute you're falling out of your chair, the next, you're good to go.  Alert and focused.  It's been a lifesaver more than once.  I'm also going to school online, and it has saved my bacon there, as well. I get the 12 pack and keep some at home and some in my drawer at work.  For me, its effect is usually about 3 hours, though.<br /><br />I seem to need the whole bottle, and I guess I'm one of the few that really prefers the Lemon-Lime flavor to the others.  The taste's not great; but it beats Red Bull and the like in taste, and effectiveness - and, you only have to drink the small bottle instead of a whole can.  Only 4 calories.  Sugarfree.  Not much caffeine.  I can honestly say the only time I've experienced anything close to jitters, is when I drank two in one day.  Even then, it wasn't the usual "too much caffeine" jitters.  It's the best thing I've ever found.  Tried another brand last month- tasted even worse and didn't work as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend 5 Hour!

review/text: I purchased this product late last week for my husband.  He had been buying it at a local mom & pop store for about a week.  He had been very pleased with its results.  When I placed the order, I told him I thought it would be here on Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest.  On Tuesday morning, the UPS truck rolled into my driveway with my order.  I could not have been more pleased.  Not only was the speed of delivery fast from CA to ME, but it was well packaged, in a properly sized box with minimal packing materials(appealing to the enviromentalist in me).  I had also looked at other products on your site and will be ordering again soon.  The prices were very good as compared to the health food store where I generally get these products.  Thank you for your great service.  It is most appreciated.  Annette from Maine

review/summary: Gooood Stuff!
review/text: My brother (who's in the Air Force) loves this stuff, and eventually I got into it as well. I just sent him a 12 pack  as a gift to keep him going during his daily 12 hour shifts.<br /><br />If you have never tried regular 5 hour, I would try that first (especially half a bottle to see how it effects you). Then, if you feel like it's just so-so, try one of these extra strength ones and you might see a significant improvement. Energy products affect us all in different ways, and 5-Hour Extra is packed full with high amounts of B-complex and energy concentrated mixture (Gaurana, Taurine, Caffeine, Ginseng, etc.). I've read doctor's reviews of energy supplements like these, and as long as you aren't chugging down more than the recommended amount (2 bottles a day max), they are perfectly fine. Make sure you talk to a MD if you have high blood pressure, or have medications that might interact with a highly caffeinated shot such as these.<br /><br />I recommend putting these in the refrigerator and drinking them in the morning, or an hour before working out.

review/summary: As ineffective for me as sugar-free Red Bull...
review/text: First off, let me repeat what a few other reviewers have remarked:  different people are likely to have somewhat varied reactions to this product.<br /><br />And some background:  In the past I've had both Red Bull and Sugar-free Red Bull.  Red Bull works wonders for me.  If I take it at 10pm, I have great focus and concentration and I can stay up working all night long through to the morning.  But Sugar-free Red Bull has no effect on me whatsoever.  I can take it at 10pm and fall asleep 10 minutes later.<br /><br />'5-Hour Energy' has a very similar effect on me as Sugar-free Red Bull.  Which is, basically, nothing.  That said, '5-hour Energy' appears to be more likely to (1) give me a headache, (2) make me lethargic, (3) and make me want to go to sleep.<br /><br />So, if you are like me and need sugar for Red Bull to work for you, then likely this '5-hour Energy' drink won't do anything for you either.

review/text: I purchased several different Korean Noodle Soups and I like this "HOT" bag version. The product is a great soup with much flavor, a very spicy hot taste (at least to me) and lots of noodles. I modify this and other Korean soups a little by adding some cut-up pieces of 3 or 4 green onions and some cut-up pieces of roasted chicken breast "after" making the soup (do not add extras during the boiling process as that over-cooks the additions) to make it higher in protein. I usually have this and other Korean soups every day for a great "power lunch". Love this soup and other Korean soups, they are fast and easy to make in a pot or by pre-heating the water in a microwave and then pouring it over the dry soup in a bowl.

review/text: I have 3 dogs ranging in size and age: 8 year old Husky Medium/Large, >1 year old SharLab midsize, and a Rot/Pit/Shepard/Lab 4 years old thats a beast (huge)!<br /><br />Anyway, these 3 dogs are now on the Merrick Whole Earth foods and loving it!  Prior to this food I have tried everything, including prescription food which was dog dependent so it got REALLY exspensive fast.  Merrick food is very reasonably priced and the ingridients were well chosen (designed well for overall health).<br /><br />The husky: Very VERY picky eater. She refuses almost anything you put in front of her, many times she would skip 3 or 4 meals just because it did not appeal to her.  She does not eat this food with gusto (as her favorite meal is salmon and cornbread stolen from a plate) but she does eat this food with little hesitation and she seems to be doing well (unfortunately we need to put her on senior diet as shes pudging up a bit)<br /><br />The SharLab: Shes a new adition so her dietary habbits are that of a puppy, eat everything and anything. However recent vet visits have found her in tip-top health.<br /><br />The Rot/Pit/Shepard/Lab: This poor dog... lets just say anything that could have gone wrong to him did before he was adopted. He has extreme allergic reactions (hair loss, skin rashes, skin breaks and drying), digestive issues (gas, vomits mostly), behavioral issues linked to inncident before being adopted :[ (anger management, compulsive doggy disorder, extreme doggy depression when his humans arent around) and then some... anyway from this laundry list of defects it seems that his diet controlled many of the "flare ups" that he had.  Lets say I've tried him on at least 10 foods, merrick has been the best so far.  Since this food his gas has reduced, he no longer is having allergic puff ups or hair loss, he is maintaining a healthy weight, he no longer vomits everywhere, urinary infections have ceased to exist, his energy level has normalized he no longer runs around like he is on caffeine nor does he mope around.  He seems to be doing really well with this food.<br /><br />Food is the owners choice, this one works for all three dogs and has helped my problem dog immensley!  If you are going to try it buy the smaller bag first and see how your pooch responds to it (remember to transition slowly to any new food!) I like this food and will stick with it!

review/summary: Excellent dog food!
review/text: This has to be the best grain-based dry dog food in this price range.  Chicken meal and turkey meal are the main sources of animal protein, and the only "controversial" ingredient is the tomato pomace (byproduct of processing tomatoes, some people believe it to be a cheap filler for dog foods).  This ingredient is so far down the list that it likely makes no difference.  This product has been rated as an "above average dry dog food" earning 4 stars with DogFoodAdvisor.  The great thing about this dog food is that it is in the price range of 2 and 3 star foods (foods I wouldn't recommend)<br /><br />On to the other important point, do dogs like the taste?  My dog, a lab/pit/mutt is quite a picky eater.  Many times I have purchased dog food that she hated and had to give it away.  However, she loves this food!  My brother's lab mix also loves this food. No gas, no "smelly" poops, no problems!<br /><br />Any more pluses? Made in the USA, natural ingredients and a  great brand of dog food (only one recall in 09/10 for their beef filet square treats)!

review/summary: Merrick Whole Earth Farms dog food purchased from Amazon
review/text: I ordered the Merrick Whole Earth Farms dog food from Amazon because I live in a small rural town where there are not many healthy dog food options. I have 8 big dogs -all rescues. I had been feeding the Diamond Large Breed All Natural for quite a while. My dogs, who tend to be good, non-picky eaters, started being fussy about eating it. Since I bought 10 bags at a time and dumped them into big cans for storage, I never had numbers to check for Diamond's frequent recalls. I gave up on Diamond.<br /><br />I ordered Merrick Whole Earth Farms based on comments from other reviewers which were essentially all positive. There are no questionable ingredients according to dogfoodadvisor.com. My dogs seem to like it. They are 7 Standard Poodles and a Bluetick Hound/Dalmatian mix, age 2-14. I have 22 acres fenced and a room with a doggie door, so they play outside most of the day while I am at work. They eat about 2 cups each twice a day.<br /><br />I will buy Merrick Whole Earth Farms dog food again and I highly recommend it to other dog owners.

review/summary: Can't say I'd recommend
review/text: I really wanted to love this dog food, unfortunately, it just didn't work out. I had my 1 1/2 year old Siberian Husky on it for six months, and while he didn't lose weight during that time, he would regularly skip 2-3 meals.  His bowel movements became very liquidy, and he had to go poop so many times every day. It even got to the point that his stomach would be so upset that he would just go in the house - keep in mind that this is a fully potty trained dog. He just never seemed to enjoy this food, and it never seemed to sit well with his stomach. The final straw was when the bag I received from amazon had a horrible odor to it and 1/4 of the pieces of food in the bag seemed covered in mold. It had definitely gone bad. I'm not sure if that was amazon's fault, or an issue with the manufacturer, but either way, I pulled my dog off of this food.<br /><br />The ingredients in the food are quality and it is reasonably priced, but unfortunately it just didn't sit right with my pup.

review/text: I have two indoor adult bloodhound dogs each 100 lbs..<br />They eat 4 cups of Merrick Whole Earth Farms Adult Dry<br />Dog Food per day..<br /><br />It's hard to speak for the dogs but based on the fact that<br />they eat it all at feeding time, it's probably good tasting<br />to them. I have not once had them turn their noses up.<br /><br />My observation is that the ingredients are wholesome,Its a mix<br />of some pretty delicious meats, veggies..No corn, no grain..<br /><br />The dog food is a dark brown all solid color.. consistent small bites.<br /><br />Some talk about the dog's poop being better in some way..it didn't<br />change anything about that, nor did their weight increase..but I<br />measure and feed based on how active they are on that day..<br /><br />If I could change just one thing about this food, it would be to<br />not use a tomato paste (filler in my opinion) and to make the<br />pieces bigger for my dogs chewing pleasure..<br /><br />Will buy again, quick shipment as promised, even earlier..

review/summary: Great dog food at a great price...delivered to your door!
review/text: We have a 70 lbs lab mix and have been using the Merrick brand for a while. I just came across the Whole Earth Farms type and decided to try it. Our dog never had any food allergies and has never been particularly picky about what he eats and seems to like the taste of this. We tend to add a little bit of warm water to the dry food, which creates a nice mix. This seems to be good quality food at a very good price. Love the fact that I can order this via Amazon Prime and have it delivered in 2 days!

review/summary: One month in
review/text: (Only 4 stars because it's just been a couple of weeks so far.)<br /><br />I switched my 11 month old rottie puppy over to this from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018DLUPC">Merrick Before Grain #3 Buffalo Dry Dog Food, 25.3-Pound Bag</a> because it's cheaper and she'd shown no signs of a grain allergy overall.  She loves it, and I've seen no sign of digestive problems thus far. She's got a fairly easy stomach, so I didn't phase her over too carefully, but she had no noticeable issues with the change (probably helped by the change within the same brand, of course.) She eats a little less than when she was on the Buffalo--3-4.5 cups a day instead of 4-5 cups.  It's possible that I have a little more to clean up, you know, afterwards, but not a noticeable amount (I'm a city dweller, so this is an important factor in dog food.)<br /><br />My cat is still on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001709GF2">Merrick Before Grain #1 Chicken Dry Cat Food, 11.1 Pound Bag</a>, but while cats are obligate carnivores, I have no problem with grains in a dog diet, as long as they're in moderation and the dog isn't sensitive to them.  Of course, the cat preferred the puppy's food when she was getting Buffalo, but he is willing to compromise his ideals for the occasional nibble of this stuff too.

review/summary: Dog didn't like it and it caused vomiting
review/text: Switched from Canidae Pure Grain-Free Formula because it caused an allergic reaction to Merrick Whole Earth Formula because it was rated so highly and was affordable for a graduate student.  Unfortunately, while the Canidae caused my dog to shed fur everywhere and lose patches of his fur, he immediately disliked Merrick and would refuse to eat it.  This is a dog that eats everything that you hand him, so I was initially surprised.  Then, I realized after observing him attempt to eat the food for about a week that he was eating it fast and throwing it back up.  I understand that dogs that eat fast will sometimes choke but this never occurred before with Canidae.  Then, after about a week of eating, choking, throwing it back up, and eating it again (gross, I know) he began to refuse to eat it altogether - missing meal times and sullenly looking at me for half the day until he was starving enough to eat a couple of bites.  After thinking about whether it would be spoiling him if I just shucked the entire bag I'd bought and try another brand, he tore me down when I noticed that he was losing weight, after having already experienced rampant allergic weight loss on Canidae.  So, I switched to another brand today and observed: he tore into that new brand of dog food like today was his last day on earth.<br /><br />So, to conclude: Merrick Whole Earth Farms Dry Food is really affordable and offers quality ingredients - although it is not grain-free, the merits of grain-free are still being contested by dog nutritionists and its expensiveness (in my opinion) is the same expense that individuals would pay at the onset of the Atkins fad - which are being given to the consumer at a good, affordable price.  It is really unbecoming of the dog food market in general that consumers are forced to pay unholy prices to feed their dogs something that isn't made out of processed chicken by-products so Merrick gets an extra star from me just because there are so few foods out there that challenge its affordability balanced with quality. Unfortunately, no matter how good the price is, if your dog won't eat it, its a waste.

review/text: I really like all the other Green Sprouts products, but these are a no-go. Both the spoon and fork were broken easily by my 9 month-old baby. The spoon he easily snapped in half and the fork was shattered by him pounding it on the high chair tray. Luckily I was right there because the utensils broken and shattered into small pieces that were very sharp. I think they could be very dangerous if he swallowed a shard or put the broken end in his mouth. I would not recommend these at all. Instead try the Green Sprouts silicone toddler spoon. It is soft and flexible and has not yet broken for me.

review/text: I am a "spicy noodles and soup" person.  If you're like me, you'll like this product.  I like to boil the noodles with high heat in more water than suggested for about 5 minutes, then add an egg (to poach in the soup) for another minute and a half.  The egg will continue to cook after you take it off from the heat.  Finish it off with some chopped scallions and/or cilantro, and you've got yourself a delicious meal for about a $1!  Sometimes I'll add a few shrimps right before I add the egg to make the soup more hearty.  You can make this your own by adding other ingredients to jazz it up, like tofu, veggies, etc.  Have fun with it.  Bon appetite!

review/summary: This is GOOD noodle soup!
review/text: I ate a lot of ramen noodle soups in my college dorm days (didn't we all?) but this one is SO much better!  The noodles are the Udon style which means they are thicker and heartier than the Nissan or Maruchan.  Also, this soup contains not only a soup base packet but also a veggie packet, which the other soups don't.  Even better!<br /><br />In the veggie packet is a lot of dried seaweed, which, when added to the boiling water, rehydrates into recognizable, pleasantly chewy chunks of seaweed!  The flavor base contains mussels and cuttlefish, so, between the seaweed and those sea creatures, there is a nice seafood flavor to the broth.  And, to be honest, with Nissan and Maruchan, I really can't tell the difference between "oriental" "chicken" "beef" or "pork" flavors... they all just taste pretty much like "broth".  With this soup, the broth actually tastes good and the seafood flavor comes through!  And, while it is nicely spicy, in the future, I may add some Sriracha since I like it even spicier!  I might also add some dried mushrooms and a few green onions, and, once in a while, Sichuan peppercorns for some tingly, floral flavor since I love them in my Asian soups!<br /><br />Also, I have never been to any Asian countries (only Europe) but Hubby has spent a lot of time with the military in Japan and Korea, so I asked him how this packaged soup compared to noodle vendors on the streets... and he said that they usually included some sort of protein (squid, octopus, pork or beef mostly) with the soup, but the noodles and broth were VERY similar to the flavor and spiciness of this soup.  He also enjoys it!<br /><br />As some reviewers recommended, I also added an egg at the end of cooking to add to the protein.  I love to cook, but there are days when I'm just too tired and 2 packages of this soup makes a nice, filling (and quick and easy!) meal for under a dollar each for Hubby and me.  I actually purchased this soup at a HUGE Asian market about 30 miles from me... for $1.09, so amazon beats their price if you spend $25 to get free shipping... and you don't have to spend the gas!  I see they now also have a subscription service which lowers the price even further.<br /><br />Compared to Nissan and Maruchan (and especially that dreck in the "cup o' noodles" which has NO flavor!), this Nong Shim soup rates 5 stars from me!

review/summary: As good as a bagged chunk of noodles and mysterious powder can be
review/text: I've been eating Nong Shim Neoguri for about 20 years... I was introduced to it in high school by a Korean student, and I've been slurping them ever since.  Back in those days, a case of 20 at the local Korean market was $7.  Now, they're $20+ on Amazon.  Still worth it though.<br /><br />There are really three things going on in the package:<br /><br />- The noodles: The heavy buckwheat Udon-style noodles have superior flavor and texture compared to ramen and other instant noodles.<br /><br />- The soup base: Very salty, very (red) peppery.  Not too complex, but tasty, and if you want complex from a bag of instant noodles, you might need to adjust your expectations.<br /><br />- The seaweed: I don't like seaweed, but I like this.  I don't know why that is.<br /><br />Because I like spicy, I typically use much less water than called for (I use about 1-2 cups depending on how brave I'm feeling) to produce almost more of a sauce that coats the noodles than a soup.  In my opinion, these noodles are at their best if you can eat them with a fork and still have minimal broth left over when you're done.  You may want to bring Tums to that party though.<br /><br />These are, in my opinion, as good as it gets in the instant noodle market.  I.e. they are five-star instant noodles, not five-star food.<br /><br />Downsides: The sodium and saturated fat are really high, if I still ate these like I did when I was 18, I'd be dead by now (37).  Also, merely reading the list of chemicals involved out loud may cause an allergic reaction in organic eaters.  I harbor a dim suspicion that ingesting enough would varnish one's insides in a way that may be of interest to anyone interested in bringing mummification back into fashion.

Add diced or sliced fresh soup vegetables (onion, carrot, celery, okra, etc) and the spice mix and the dried veggie mix.  Cook until the carrots are softened. Then toss in diced fresh tomato and the noodles (I like to pulverize the noodles in the package first so they will stay on my soup spoon; cannot master chopsticks!). Just before you take it off the heat, toss in a raw egg or two and mix rapidly.<br /><br />Then you have a big hearty pot of soup, with the salt and MSG diluted but still full of flavor, feeds 2 or 3.

I'll buy another box when the price gets near $10 for a box of 20 again.  I usually boil for only 3 minutes to get a more al dente taste.<br /><br />Like all instant noodles, these are kind of high in fat and calories.  The nutrition information is for less than half a package.  If you're on a diet, you should eat more veggies instead of these noodles.

review/summary: Maybe should call it spicy seaweed soup
review/text: Guess I am one of the few that was not real impressed by this flavor.  I did not hate it, but found it only to taste of seaweed rather than seafood.  For some reason I don't classify seaweed as quite making the more generic seafood category.  LOL  That said I did not hate it either.  It was definitely OK for a change of pace, I was not wow'd by the seaweed flavor, and the spicyness was basically a red pepper type spicy.  I am more of a fan of the Nong Shim KimChi soup.  For some reason that one hits the spot for me, and the spicy flavor is different than the normal red pepper flavor that comes across with this soup.

review/summary: Tasty Spicy Seafood Udon by NongShim
review/text: NongShim Neoguri Spicy Seafood Udon Type Noodle is my third Nongshim noodle that I've tried and love (I have tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQORDE">Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun, Gourmet Spicy Picante, 4.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 20)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQJT5K">Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Ramyun, 4.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 20)</a>).<br /><br />The taste of this noodle is spicy and seafood-y, and I personally like the dried vegetables that are included with this noodle; I think there are dried seaweed and kelp, and also some chopped green onions. At first, I was a little bit disappointed due to the 'fishy' smell of the soup base (just like one of the reviewers here mentioned, the smell did remind me of fish food); however, after the noodle was done cooking, I was happy to find that the smell was significantly reduced. Also, because this is supposed to be an udon noodle, the texture, which I like, is thick and chewy.<br /><br />Although this noodle is tasty, there is a downside. I found that all the instant ramen noodles that I have eaten so far are guilty for their notoriously high sodium content, including this one. The whole package of soup base powder cost us 86% of our daily sodium intake allowance, which is worrying to me (note that on the package, it says that the sodium content is 43% of the daily allowance; but it's only for half serving).<br /><br />What I do to deal with this: I use only half of the soup base powder and use less water so that the soup won't be too bland (I can always adjust the amount of water later on). I also add a splash of sesame oil before turning off the heat, and maybe some chopped fresh green onions when I'm not too lazy to do the chopping. Sometimes I also add imitation crab meat or eggs. Doing these really make the noodles more flavorful without having to use all of the soup base powder. If you're still worried about the sodium, do what I sometimes do: eat the solids only, and maybe several sips of the soup and dump the rest of it.<br /><br />All in all, this noodle is tasty and can potentially be healthier if we avoid using all of the soup base powder. I give this product 5 out of 5 stars.

review/text: This is the only instant noodle that everyone I know who tried it absolutely loves! It's spicy (to make it less spicy, put the packet in only at the end, and put in less powder.), and the noodles are nice and thick. I like to cook mine a bit longer so the noodles get thicker. Note: The closer to the expiration date, the longer you'd have to cook it to get the same texture. The noodle bag comes with 2 packets, one with veggies and seaweed and one with flavor powder.<br /><br />From what I can tell, this is the exact same product as Nong Shim's "Seafood" noodle. It just has the non-English name, "Neoguri"...<br /><br />The difference between this and Shin Ramyun (another one of my favorites) is it has seaweed instead of mushrooms in the veggie packet.

review/summary: Many Ways to Cook
review/text: I like these, especially when I am on a budget. To make these right, you need to have two pots of boiling water. Bring both pots to a rapid boil. Add the noodles to one pan and let come back to rapid boil. Other pan, once boiling add some vegetables, I add some sliced red onion, add one or two eggs and cook only till whites are cooked but leave the yolks raw. The yoke is great dripping over the noodles. When the noodles are done, drain the water and rinse the noodles. That gets rid of the palm oil that they are deep fried in and some of the extra starch. Once the eggs are done to your liking, drain off the water until  you only have enough for the amount of broth you want. Add the packets to this pan. I only use half of the hot powder. Then place the noodles in a large bowl and poor the broth, egss and vegetables over the noodles. If you time this right, you can add some thin sliced beef or even sprinkle some grated cheese then cover and let the hot water cook the beef and melt the cheese. I use a stainless steel bowl and if it is not hot enought to melt the cheese or cook the beef to your liking you can put it on the burner for a little while. Or, you can add the beef earlier right after the egg. Slice the beef thin, I like flank steak, and it will cook quickly. I like my beef rare.

review/text: I bought this to eat as a noodle soup for lunch.  It's pretty spicy and I'm trying to cut back on my salt intake, so I usually use just half the soup base packet, which is perfect for me.  It's great as a soup, but I've taken to adding just enough hot water to float the noodles, then microwaving for 5 minutes.  Just about all the water gets absorbed and I end up with a sort of "yakisoba-like" noodle dish that is pretty addictive. I agree that it can be a little seaweedy if you're not used to that sort of thing, but to me it's no stronger than the average dashi you get in Japanese restaurants.  For the price, this is a cheap, tasty, and filling noodle dish.

review/text: These are very good noodles. They're very easy to prepare in a microwave. An excellent snack on their own, but be aware that the included spice pack is very hot (I like it like that) and you may want to experiment with how much you add. It would be a shame to waste those tasty noodles because you overdid the spice. You can always add a little more if it's not hot enough.

review/text: I love this ramen. It's so cheap and easy to make. What I do is I boil about 20 oz of water (a little more than recommended since I like the broth), put the noodles in. Around 3 minutes I put in a beaten egg, then stir and chop to make the eggs into little pieces. At the 4 minute mark I put in the spice and veggie packet. Around 6 minutes I turn off the heat. Stir occasionally throughout. Comes out perfectly and much better than microwaving!

review/summary: uggg... spicy seaweed soup for sure
review/text: I had really high hopes for this soup... we love asian foods/soups, seafood, seaweed, noodles and spice.  So it sounded like a perfect combo!<br /><br />I know this review is in the minority, but please remember that it is just my own personal experience and does not reflect the rest of the world, which is why it is "my review".<br /><br />So, I excitedly made a bowl this morning and after the first bite had to force myself to eat half a bowl worth... in a word it was disgusting.  Maybe mine are from a defective batch, but the seaweed & very HOT pepper is all you can taste... no seaFOOD not even an undercurrent.  And now that my throat & mouth are still burning & my stomach is queasy (hours later) I am wondering why I forced myself to eat even that much.<br /><br />I did give 2 stars for the noodles since they seem like they will be good without the flavor packets.

review/text: I have been eating this stuff for quite some time.  It never gets old.  I absolutely love the noodle quality and the dried seafood packet.  I tend to use much less water and only put in 1/2 of the hot spice packet.  I ALso love my noodles "al dente" so after the water boils, I only cook the noodles for 1 minute and serve it up.  Sometimes I add a few Vietnamese beef balls (with tendon), sometimes add peas.  The beauty of ramyun is that you can customize it to suite your taste.

It's different than regular ramen noodles since those are extremely instant; this kind you have to let it cook for a little longer to make sure it's getting softer and wider and edible. It's not that spicy if you take it easy with the spice packets. I always receive it quite fast after I place the order so I like that too.

It's really not that fishy and I know another review said it smells like an aquarium... Nope. It doesn't. It's seaweed that has a smell, but it's not bad. Effing delicious and spicy. Buy NOW!<br /><br />I also strongly recommend the Shin Noodle Ramyun if you just wanna steer clear of the seafood.

Seafood based broth is thick and strong in this soup. I have been ejoying the product for years and I am still not tired of it. LOL. I highly recommend this product to any noodle lovers.

review/text: I purchased several different Korean Noodle Soups and I like this version too. The product is a great soup with much flavor, a nice spicy hot taste (at least to me), a good seafood taste (sea weed and other sea spices I think) and lots of noodles. I modify this and other Korean soups a little by adding some cut-up pieces of 3 or 4 green onions "after" making the soup (do not add extras during the boiling process as that over-cooks the additions) to add a little taste and texture. I usually have this and other Korean soups every day for a great "power lunch". Love this soup and other Korean soups, they are fast and easy to make in a pot or by pre-heating the water in a microwave and then pouring it over the dry soup in a bowl.

review/summary: Best Ramen Ever
review/text: We have been buying this Ramen for years whenever we can find it at the local grocery. It was so great to get it in bulk from Amazon. This has thicker noodles so they have some substance. It comes with two packets. One is seaweed and little chunks of mystery seafood, if you like seaweed you will want to use this packet. I love it because there is more then one kind one seaweed in it. The other packet is the soup/spice mix. It is hot and delicious. When I make this as just noodles I only use half the package, for soup you can chance the whole thing. Especially if you have a cold and want to clear out our sinuses. In fact, this is right up there with chicken soup as a great comfort food when you are sick and just want to sit on the couch with a hot bowl of soup and watch cartoons.

review/summary: Spicy with a hint of "seafood"
review/text: This ramen noodle soup is much better than plain old Top Ramen or Cup Noodles. In the package is three things: the noodle block, the broth packet, and the vegetable packet. The Udon-style noodles are pressed together in a circle shape. They're thicker than regular ramen, and have a very slight chewiness to them when cooked. The red broth powder is in the foil packet. You can smell the spiciness when you open it. The broth is quite spicy, but only has a hint of a seafood flavor. Most of the "seafood" comes from the veggie packet, which contains a bunch of seaweed, green onion flakes, carrot bits, and shiitake mushroom pieces. You could say it's a Spicy Seaweed flavor instead of Spicy Seafood. Overall, it's some of the best ramen I've had.<br /><br />Oh, and Nong Shim gives both stovetop and microwave cooking directions on the package. Nice if you only have a stove or microwave available.

review/summary: Best Packaged Noodles (Ramen)
review/text: I have been eating this specific type of packaged noodles for over a decade... well before Nong Shim products became prolific in so many U.S. supermarkets.<br /><br />This is my favorite flavor from Nong Shim. Here are some tips to turn this from a quick snack into a great, hearty meal:<br /><br />Use your favorite brand of chicken broth mixed with water. Add some or all of the contents of the seasoning into the chicken broth / water mixture. Wait for it to boil. Cook the noodles for about 8-10 minutes. Roughly 4 minutes after you put the ramen into the pot, add your favorite meat product if you're not a vegetarian. I personally prefer pre-cooked, seasoned ground pork or ground beef. Finally, put in an egg or two into the pot. The eggs will sink to the bottom so turn down the heat if you're adding the eggs to the soup.<br /><br />Be careful not to add too much of the red spice packet. People who love extremely spicy food add half the packet or more, but I recommend most people not to do this. Not only does the soup become undrinkable, but the spice packet is what includes the MSG. I usually sprinkle a thin layer of the red spice once before the soup boils and another time after I put the ramen into the soup.

review/summary: Even better than the original NONG SHIM Noodle
review/text: I've been a long time fan of the Nong Shim picante original noodles, they are of superior texture and the soup is actually spicy enough to kick the spot. I ran out of stock of them recently so I decided to order from Amazon, and try a different flavor. Amazon sells the 20 packs box about 4 dollars cheaper than my local Korean market, free shipping, and the noodles arrived within 2 days. Compared to the original flavor, I like Neoguri even more because of its thicker noodle and the soup base is more flavorful, thanks to the added seaweed, without reducing spiciness. The thicker noodle means you can cook it longer without worrying the noodles turn soft, a problem I frequently had with the original flavor (not to mention any other brand of instant noodles). Give them a try if you can tolerate spiciness!
