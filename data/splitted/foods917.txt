review/summary: Good price for very good popcorn portions
review/text: We have one of the smaller 4 foot Nostalgia popcorn kettle poppers and the kettle doesn't seem too big and finding popcorn portions for it is not as easy as I had thought. Amazon to the rescue! -- I found these smaller portion packets (2.5 oz) and these packets seem to do the trick.  The popcorn was very good - just the right amount of salt and butter flavor.  No fault of the popcorn itself but rather the popcorn popper, I concluded that 2.5oz of popcorn is not nearly enough popcorn for 2 or 3 people, especially when 6-7 percnt of the kernels never pop (again blaming the machine) and I usually end up having to make two - 2.5 oz servings for 3 people. Thats when the novelty of making concession style popcorn can get pricey.<br /><br />With free shipping this is one of the best deals around. I would recommend it to others and suggest that they try one box and determine if the taste is satisfying to their palete, if its not for you, you can always send me the unused packs and switch to microwave popcorn at a fraction of the cost.

review/summary: Very good popcorn!
review/text: This popcorn actually tastes like the theater popcorn. All the kernals pop up and it makes ALOT of popcorn. You don't need to add anything extra to it after it's popped to make it flavorful because it is so good on it's own. Just be aware that the oil pack is hard. It's almost like stick butter but it quickly melts in the popper. I just mention that because at first, I thought there was something wrong with it. Makes watching movies at home very enjoyable! You can store the popcorn if you can't eat it all and it even tastes good a little stale. Very pleased with this purchase!

review/summary: This is the real deal
review/text: This is great tasting movie theater popcorn that can be enjoyed in your popcorn machine for days after being popped. It is good to have a convienent 4oz package to easily make up great tasting batches of popcorn when wanted. We have a Nostalgia Electric 4oz Movie Time Popcorn Cart in our home theater room and this makes it perform like a professional model producing real movie theater popcorn. You can even add a tiny bit of Orville Redenbacher's Buttery Flavor Popping and Topping oil to get extra butter flavor, like when adding butter topping at the movies. We were concerned about possible lingering popcorn smell in our theater room, but this has not been an issue at all. Clean up is a bit more involved than after using just regular oil and popcorn (more oil and seasoning thrown around), but it is not too bad and worth the effort. This is a great product for 4oz machines.

review/summary: True movie theater taste!!!
review/text: I have tried several different portion packs and this is the best!!! It has the movie theater taste your looking for. It is a little salty so, if you don't like salty,don't buy it. Don't be alarmed when the package arrives and the oil is solid. That is normal. Either keep them in a warm place(boiler room) or turn on the warmer part of your popcorn maker first and rest the package on it and the oil will liquify. Then enjoy the show!!!

review/text: I bought my wife a new popcorn popper for her birthday and was looking for some high quality popcorn to go with it. She loves movie theater popcorn, and others said they thought this popcorn had similar taste. Well, they're RIGHT! This is fantastic tasting popcorn. It pops up fluffy and tastey, with very few unpopped kernals. I was very pleased with the pre-measured packaging making it super easy to dump in the machine and let it do all the work. We've already re-ordered a box since our first batch, and I am anxiously waiting for it to come back in stock so we can order even more!

review/summary: Not very impressed at all...
review/text: I ordered the Little Bambino popcorn popper along with a 24ct. box of this popcorn.  All the items arrived right before Christmas (love Amazon Prime!) as promised.  The popcorn popper itself was a breeze to set up.  I got this for my girlfriend as she LOVES popcorn.  The reason for the low review?  The popcorn is HORRIBLE!  It was tough and chewy.  We ended up with just as many kernels as we did with popped popcorn.  I tried to excuse this since it was the first time using the machine, but 4 bags later and the popcorn is still just as tough and chewy as the first batch.  And did I mention that the popcorn was way too salty but that was more than like the result of so much of it not popping.<br /><br />Once you hear the popcorn popper stop popping popcorn, your supposed to turn off the popper as it will burn what's left in the popper because it's all jammed with popcorn. The oil has to go in first so the popcorn doesn't get burned when you drop it in the popper.  I tried to alter the steps in different ways hoping the popcorn would come out better but it just didn't work out for us.<br /><br />Gonna give good 'ol Mr. Redenbacher a shot next.  Now I just need to figure out how to cancel my 'popcorn subscription'.

review/summary: Good & Bad
review/text: The good:<br /> - Good taste;<br /> - Pops up plump;<br /> - Convenient.<br /><br />The bad:<br /> - Lots of unpopped kernels (far more than any other brand I've used). You get plenty of popped corn, but it seems a waste and could lead you to question freshness or quality of the corn;<br /> - Uses the coal tar dyes Yellow #5 and #6 which have been implicated in various health issues and are listed as Group I carcinogens by the IARC.<br /> - The generic term "natural and artificial color" is used rather than listing actual flavor contents.<br /> - No "best by" or expiration date on the package<br /><br />For me the bad will prevent me from ordering more of this otherwise good popcorn. I don't need questionable additives just to make my popcorn yellow, and it leaves a colorful gross residue in the pan after popping. And for flavor, if the popcorn itself, along with whatever I want to add on my own, can't carry the day, I will find a product that can stand on its own.<br /><br />Other:  You only need 4 oz, or half this bag, to completely fill a standard Whirley-Pop so you can cut back as needed. Very salty for my taste, so you may want to start with much less than the salt offered and then salt to taste till you find the amount that works for you.

review/summary: Popcorn tastes like cardboard
review/text: I ordered this popcorn based on the glowing reviews. It's possible that I received popcorn with an expired date but have no way of telling from the packaging. Food is not allowed to be returned to Amazon so I am stuck with over 20 bags of corn kernels that are inedible. Followed the directions exactly and popped the corn in my new popper, making sure not to over cook. Popcorn came out stale tasting with card board consistency. It was dry and just awful. My first and last time ordering this.

review/summary: Varying Freshness Ruins What Could Be Great Popcorn
review/text: My wife and I take movies and popcorn very seriously. Every Friday and Saturday night, after the kids are in bed, we turn out the lights, pop in a blu-ray, and sit down to a movie with popcorn and soda. For about a year or so we had been buying fresh popcorn locally, but the shop had closed down and we searched for a replacement on Amazon. We knew we wouldn't find popcorn as fresh, but we were mostly concerned with flavor. We bought a box of Great Northern popcorn.<br /><br />The box arrived and I was a bit concerned with the look of the oil in the packets... it didn't look like oil at all, but rather butter after you melt a solid stick and it cools and coagulates back into a solid. It was more yellow then orange, had a curdled/marbled look to it, and felt a bit stiff. I looked all over the packaging to find an expiration date, but there wasn't any. I checked the reviews and saw that people had said it was suppose to be solid, so I went ahead and tried it. Once the oil started heating up, it melted instantly, so everything seemed ok. Although the flavor was really good, the popcorn certainly wasn't very fresh. We figured that we were so use to the fresh local popcorn that we were being too overly critical of it, so we continued to make it every weekend.<br /><br />When we were almost out of popcorn packs, we bought Orville Reddenbacher popcorn and popcorn oil at the grocery store. The popcorn was MUCH fresher, but didn't taste anywhere near as good, so we bought another case of Great Northern from Amazon. This second case was completely different from the first. The oil in the packs was orange and actually looked like solidified popcorn oil. It was also much softer, almost like a gel. We popped a pack that night and was shocked at how much better it was... the popcorn was much fresher and simply fantastic.<br /><br />A few days later I found that a friend of ours had bought a box of Great Northern from another website and stopped eating it after the third pack. He said it was stale and not very enjoyable. I gave him a pack of ours and he loved it, so he's going to return the box he got and hope to get a fresher one.<br /><br />It's a shame that there aren't better quality controls with this popcorn... a simple expiration date on the outside of the case would assure that everyone gets a reasonably fresh supply. I added an image above to show the difference between a pack in our first box (old) and one from our second box (fresh). If you get an old case, I highly recommend returning it and getting a fresher case... it'll be the difference between getting a good bowl of popcorn and a Great one.<br /><br />If I had never bought a second case, I would have rated this 3 stars. The second case was definitely a 5-star rating, but due to the inability to tell how fresh the product is until you actually open it, I can't give it more then 3 stars. This is not Amazon's fault since they would have to open the boxes and have someone judge how good it looks prior to shipping. This is a pretty big issue since if it weren't for me, my friend would have tossed his case in the garbage and would have written Great Northern off as a low-quality brand.

review/summary: Un-Pop-Corn
review/text: I ordered a case of this popcorn using the automatic re-order system.  After reading some of the reviews about the quality of the popcorn, I chose to give it a chance, price being one of my primary reasons for ordering and the automatic re-order feature.  Well, as they say, you get what you pay for.  Only about 2/3 of the kernels pop and of the ones that do, the popped corn is very small in size.  The product tastes really good, what you're able to get from the package.  By the time you figure the amount of unpopped kernels, you would be much better off spending a little more money for a premium product.

review/text: I have a Pasadena popcorn machine from The Great Northern Popcorn company, so I though I'd try their pre-measured popcorn packets. Previously, I have used Vogel's pre-measured packs and compared to Vogels, this stuff is a bit saltier. It's very good, but Vogels is identical to movie theater popcorn in flavor; sweet, buttery, and more of the true corn taste then this.<br /><br />You can always reduce the amount of butter salt, or not add any at all from the packet. For my comparison, I used the entire packet contents which to me, produced popcorn with a bit to much saltiness.<br /><br />If you find this popcorn to be to salty, try Vogel's pre-measured packets.

So if you don't want it salty, just don't cut open the seasoning portion of the three part package.

review/summary: Good price, Great Popcorn
review/text: Not the healthiest thing on the menu but when you want the taste of Movie Theater popcorn there is really no other substitute.  The portion, flavor and salt are all perfectly measured so we have never needed to add anything else (except maybe a dash of tobasco or some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product but wished it was a little cheaper (hence 4 instead of 5 stars).  I guess you can't have everything.

review/summary: Easy popcorn
review/text: I'm happy to say that in this case a pretty package equals yummy popcorn. The freshness is just what you would hope to receive and it is easy to use. It's a little salty if you pour in the entire seasoning packet (I guess it is better to have too much than not enough).<br /><br />The popcorn has a slighly sweet taste with an acceptable amount of "old maids".  It is definately better than the popcorn I had before and I'd purchase this again.  Finally, this review is for the 4oz package.

review/summary: Avoid this popcorn
review/text: After making several batches using different techniques I can only get 50% of the kernels to pop.  I used a different brand of kernels with much better results.  The only conclusion I can come to is that these packages are stale.  It doesn't help that there is no expiration or manufacture date listed anywhere on the packages.  I would recommend to not buy this product.

review/text: I tried this product about 2 years ago and it was just like movie theatre popcorn at that time but since that time, they must have changed the product and now tastes more like a microwave popcorn that lacks flavor.  The packaging has changed to include a separate salt/butter flavor compartment and the oil is now a liquid instead of a solid. Very disappointed in this product and sadly I now have 23 packets remaining.

review/summary: Popcorn Tastes Stale, Dry and Old
review/text: We had just received this afternoon  and popped one bag to share this eve. We followed directions exactly. You taste the hint of movie theatre popcorn, but this popcorn is not fresh. We were very disappointed and couldn't even eat what we had popped. We have had this type of product by a different name and maker at a friends home, and their product exceeded this one with more freshness and taste  in every way. I wanted to return immediately, but Amazon policy for this item wouldn't allow it. The best popcorn is fresh popcorn. All the kernels popped; nothing burned.This is just old stale popcorn. Obviously, I would never buy it again, nor would I ever recommend it!

review/summary: Never Again
review/text: I ordered the Deluxe 6oz Red Popcorn Maker Machine by Paramount Entertainment and as an accompaniment I also ordered the Great Northern Popcorn, 6-Ounce Portion Packs (24 pack). The popcorn maker I like very much but the Great Northern Popcorn is terrible. The flavor isn't all that bad but only 2 ounces of the 6 oz package pop. With one pack, I thought I would give extra time but the unpopped kernels just burned, they never popped. The package itself is hard to use and I needed to cut it apart with a scissor before I could use it. Also, and this is the worst, one 6oz package has 900 calories. I usually eat popcorn as a low calorie treat but not this stuff. One person will end up eating the amount that pops and with the calories being in the grease package, all of the grease calories are put on the 2oz that pop. The last few packages I popped, I fed it to my dogs (which usually love popcorn). They had a few bites than left it alone. My solution - off the shelf popcorn with 3oz of canola oil and some sea salt - � the calories, 90% kernel pop and much better flavor.

review/summary: salty salty salty
review/text: The first pan was pretty oily, in fact I think the oil weighed more than the kernels. In the second pan I used only half the oil that came with it, it popped the same as the first pan and would have tasted good except for the extreme amount of salt.  this popcorn is so salty I couldn't eat it and my husband who is a salt addict even complained about too much salt!  I will add that the butter flavor does not taste like butter and has a very slight chemical aftertaste. I bought a case so we have a great deal to use yet.  in the future I'll try to sift the salt out of the popcorn before adding the kernels to the pan.  there were many old maids and the popped kernels were not as big and fluffy as Redenbacher's.  Also one pack only made about 1/2 pan of popcorn in my whirley-pop popcorn maker which is too bad as i had hoped it would be just the right amount.  I'm very disappointed in the quality of this popcorn.  At the price I expect a so called gourmet popcorn to make a whole pan, taste better and pop fluffier than what I can get from grocery store kernels.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I purchased a case of this popcorn for two reasons: the rave reviews of others on Amazon and it was a lower-priced alternative to Wabash Valley Farms Real Theater Popcorn.<br /><br />This is what I found:<br /><br />- In my opinion, Great Northern Popcorn is not as tasty as Real Theater Popcorn.<br />- While Great Northern has a 6-ounce portion compared to Wabash Valley Farms 5.5 ounce portion it exceeded the capacity on both my Whirley Pop and Stir Crazy poppers.  (Literally lifted the top off of my Stir Crazy.)  So more is not necessarily better especially when you have to clean up a mess after every popping.<br />- Quite bit more of the Great Northern Popcorn remained unpopped.<br />- Great Northern Popcorn had a "chewy" texture to it.

review/summary: Not tender
review/text: We were very disappointed in this product. I had read the reviews and was expecting a delicious, theater quality popcorn. I popped it according to directions in our stove top Whirley Pop. The popcorn was not tender at all, tasted old and chewy, with a lot of the hard hull remaining on the popped product.  The popcorn also had a very strange heavy after taste and an odd smell. Another reviewer mentioned a slight coconut oil after taste, this was not slight but very pronounced. Our kids, who can each eat a bag of popped corn a piece during a movie--even if it's scorched, didn't like it at all. We each took a couple of bites and threw the entire bowl out. It was awful! If I can, I will return it and ask for a refund....if I can't, I will toss it out. I won't even donate it to the food bank...it was that bad.

Lastly, it wasn't as fresh tasting like at our local movie theatre, which uses Orville Redenbacher. I'm going to google and see what Orville Redenbacher makes for kettle popcorn makers.

review/text: I was concerned when I received it because of the oil being solidified.  I looked for a date on it to see if it was old product, but did not find any dates.  I tried one package to see how it tasted.  It tasted normal.  It was a little more difficult to get out of the package since I had to do just the oil first to let it melt before putting the popcorn and seasoning parts of the package in.  It would be nice if the packages were dated so that I know how long I have to use them for best results, and I'm really not sure of how old they are to begin with.<br /><br />So bottom line, I was happy with the taste, but convenience is somewhat diminished because the oil is solid.<br /><br />Added 11/28/11 - I do prefer to use less of the seasoned salt.  It's pretty salty for me, so I just don't use it all and it tastes fine still.

review/summary: Saturated Fat Nightmare
review/text: With all the reviews of this popcorn, I'm surprised not to find any mention of the horrible saturated fat content of this. Anyone with any concern about their cholesterol or saturated fat content really needs to look closely at the nutritional guide. I couldn't find it listed on their website so I asked them to email me a copy. Wow, 40g of saturated fats in one of these packets and they call it 5 servings. Daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie/day person is 16. You would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. The biggest concern I have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. The problem is entirely with the oil they are using. Coconut oil. They list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. Most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. I asked Great Northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. They refused. It tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. In some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. I love popcorn. But health is a concern to me. If you are concerned about saturated fats, look at the nutritional guide for these packets.

review/text: Great product, its really more popcorn than the 4 oz kettle can handle at one time, you have to experiment with it to figure out how much to use, I use about half of the corn for two popings and use very little salt.  The oil can be divided into two batches and it works out really great.  Makes a lot of popcorn, plenty for two or three people, and has a good taste, comes packed in a handy packets and just cut small corners out to pour the oil and popcorn into a measuring cup to put into the kettle.  Use the salt sparingly, there is way to much salt if you use it all.

review/summary: Results **Depend on how you make it**
review/text: I used my Stir Crazy popper - almost every kernel popped, but it's quite dry for an oil popped corn. I think there might just be too much corn for the amount of oil. And definitely doesn't have the movie theater taste or texture. Also, if you put all the seasoning salt in with the corn & oil, a lot of it sticks to the machine, so I leave a little to sprinkle on afterwards to help with the flavor. I'm thinking maybe I'll try not using all the corn, next time and see if that is a better corn-to-oil ratio. I might also try just using a big pot too and see if that's any better than the Stir Crazy.<br /><br />** EDIT ** July 2011 ** so, after popping quite a few bags in different ways, I can say now that if you use a regular kettle, with only 1/2 the salt, it tastes great. I think it's because only about 2/3 of it pops - so this allows for more oil/flavor per kernel.

review/summary: Great popcorn, a little salty
review/text: The popcorn arrived the same day as our new Great Northern Foundation 8 oz popcorn machine. While using these packets couldn't be simpler, they are just a smidge too wide for easy access to the preheated popping bucket. You're having to dump the whole package, oil, salt and popcorn, into the bucket from the side, and if the oil, salt and popcorn were all in one compartment, it might be narrower and easier. That said, we found the popcorn that came out of these prepackaged packets just a little salty for our taste. In future, we'll probably make it without using the whole packet of salt. The butter-flavored salt is a great idea, just maybe a little less of it.

review/summary: Makes life so easy
review/text: We bought an old-fashioned trolley popcorn machine for our children at church. These packages make popping popcorn in large quantities so easy. It takes about 1 package to feed 8-10 kids. We preheat the unit and dump the contents of the package into the bucket and that's it.  The popcorn tastes and smells like movie-theater popcorn.  Everyone loves it and we've had no negative complaints.

review/summary: Movie Style Popcorn in the Comfort of Your Own Home
review/text: We just LOVE this popcorn. We got introduced to it when I bought my wife a true popcorn machine (Great Norther 4oz Chaplain Popper and Cart). The popper and popcorn have been a wonderful addition to our home for the last 4 years and I have no plans to change any time soon.<br /><br />The simplicity of the popcorn kit packaging is great. Premeasured popcorn, salt (with butter flavor), and oil (which is solid at normal ambient room temperature make this such an easy job of making popcorn any time we want it.<br /><br />Turn on the kettle and let it heat up for 3-5 min. Squeeze out the oil and add the salt. I will say that if you use all the salt, it's quite a salty batch. We have found that using about half of the salt is about perfect. Wait till the oil is heated through and then add the popcorn. Pull down the kettle lid and wait.<br /><br />Part of the fun for us is the magic of making our own popcorn. Our kids just can't not watch the machine do the work.<br /><br />Now if one wants to complain that not all the kernels pop, I would argue that it's likely a combination of both the popcorn and the dimensions of your popping kettle. Do we lose some kernels? Yes (about 10%). Do I care? No. And why don't I care...<br /><br />The TASTE and Quantity! Even with loss of some kernels, this 4 oz package will feed 2 adults and 2 kids (5 and 2) for an entire movie. Just the perfect amount for us too. As for the taste - I don't know how anyone can eat any other popcorn once they've tasted Great Northern. I simply refuse to eat the microwave popcorn that we might make because we just don't want to clean the popcorn machine after use. The secret to that amazing, delicious, and addictable popcorn taste? Coconut Oil. It seems like such a simple ingredient, but the popcorn flavor that it helps to generate is simply amazing.<br /><br />The price is extremely reasonable too. And when I found that you could sign up for Amazon's subscribe and save, I signed up immediately. What a way to keep our machine fully stocked with the most authentic flavored movie popcorn ready for our weekly family movie night.

review/summary: Just like the movies
review/text: For the longest time, I made microwave popcorn. Never again. When I first ventured into popping my own, I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RC6R">West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper</a>. I then went to the store and bought some popcorn oil and some kernels. I was so disappointed when I had it.<br /><br />Then a friend recommended this popcorn to me, and I absolutely love it. I've bought two boxes so far from Amazon. It tastes as close to anything I've ever had to movie popcorn (minus the butter).<br /><br />A few suggestions if you use this with the Stir Crazy.<br /><br />- If you use a Stir Crazy, the 4 oz. packs will fill it up perfectly.<br />- Separate kernels on both sides of the rod in the middle, and distribute the oil in 2 portions on either side also.<br />- Enjoy!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />+ All ingredients in 1 pack.<br /><br />+ Tastes incredible.<br /><br />+ You can use as much or as little butter salt as you want.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Coconut oil is a bit sticky when you squeeze it out of the pack.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended.

This product is easy because everything you need is in one pack, easily opened and dumped into the kettle.  Tastes like movie theater popcorn too.  I'll give it a 5.

review/summary: A fix for the half kernals popping issue....
review/text: I purchased a 6oz popcorn machine so of course I thought I 'd give this pre-measured product a try. When following direct instructions off of the Great Northern product you will be left with 20-40% kernals unpopped which is VERY disappointing.<br /><br />The fix for this is to only pop half of the contents (salt, oil, and kernals) one time around and then to make a 2nd batch with the remaining half. Annoying? Yes. But this will reduce your unpopped kernals from 20-40% remaining to about 5% or less.<br /><br />This brand taste amazing but I will botch it a star for this small issue.

review/text: I got this item because the review said it tasted great and was easier.  I used to use a hot air popper, and will be going back to that method. The popcorn isn't terrible, but I didn't think it was great either.  This popcorn has a bit of a manufactured taste.  I prefer the hot air popper with melted butter on it.  I also find it easier to control the salt when I use it from a shaker.

review/summary: Tasty, but too many unpopped kernels
review/text: Not sure if this is the fault of the popcorn, the popcorn popper or the user, but I'm having a problem with unpopped kernels. I follow the instructions precisely and have tried just about everything but haven't cracked the code yet. Those kernels that do pop are tasty, but it seems like I lose 25 to 30 percent of kernels which don't pop.<br /><br />The other thing to notice, the coconut oil sort of congeals at room temperature, so I found it helpful to warm it up so it's nice an runny before putting it in my popper. Usually I just put the packet between my hand and leg for a few minutes to warm it up. Not a major problem, just something to be aware of.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't do the subscription. I think I may try another brand to see if it makes any difference.<br /><br />BTW, one 8 oz package makes enough to fill three of the bags that come with the machine with a little left over. So for my family of 5, one 8 oz package isn't really enough, but two is too much.

review/text: Bought this popcorn along with the Elite Popcorn maker.  Great taste, I like the fact that it has three separate pouches so you can vary the seasoning (I like mine salty so I use it all).  Can't be any easier to use, no measuring, popcorn & oil stay fresh because they are sealed.<br /><br />Came back to add my review and got some great tips.  Such as actually heating the oil first instead of dumping it all in at once.  Also liked the tips of adding the oil before turning on the popper (always worried about melting plastic or burning my hand) and pouring the popcorn/seasoning into a scoop to add to the popper.  Thanks to those who took the time to post the tips!

review/text: This popcorn is very convenient and tastes great.  The coconut oil is in a solid state, which it should be.  Once it hits the kettle it melts.  You heat your oil, and then add the popcorn and salt.  I do recommend putting the popcorn and salt together in a scoop or something for ease of emptying into the kettle (if you have a popcorn machine), otherwise it gets messy.<br /><br />I read several reviews that using all the salt makes the popcorn too salty.  We didn't find that at all.<br /><br />There were several unpopped kernels, so I'm not sure if this is the popcorn or not being used to our machine yet.<br /><br />This is perfect for our 4 oz popcorn machine and leaves the whole house smelling like a movie theatre.

review/text: This popcorn isn't bad tasting, but doesn't live up to the claim that it's like theater popcorn.  I think it's a little pricey based on the quantity of popped corn and the overall quality.  However, it is very convenient and hasn't gone to waste when made.  This full pack produces about the same corn quantity as half to three-quarter cup of Orville's.  If more of the corn popped (lots of kernels wasted) and/or the price was reduced, I would give it a 5 rating because of the combination of decent quality, good price, and convenience.

review/summary: Good product except
review/text: This is a pretty good product in the fact that everything is pre mesured for you.  Just cut the top and pour it in.  The only problem for me was there was waaaay to much salt.  And since it is already in the product the heat makes it stick to the popcorn so each piece has a lot of salt.  You almost need to drink a lot of water during and after you eat this.  If it had about 1/2 as much salt it would get a 5 from me, but as it is now I have to work to take the salt out when takes the ease of jsut cut and pour out of the product.  But if you like salt, its perfect for you, the best example I can think of, is that it does taste like and smell like movie popcorn, but purchase a movie popcorn and then pour about another 3 tablespoons of salt on it.

If you have purchased a home popcorn machine as we have, you will appreciate the convenience of the pre-measured packets.  No guess work involved; just great popcorn every time.  We buy it by the case in 4oz and 8oz packages.  This way if it's just my husband and myself, we make a 4oz package, and if we have company over, we can use the 8oz.  I'm sure it would be cheaper to get plain popcorn and oil, but this is well worth the cost, and isn't the popcorn what you like about going to the movies anyway?

The premeasured pouches are great, though I do wish they were individual and not in one packet so it would be easier to dump in the oil first, then the popcorn then the salt. That being said, that's a pretty small complaint and I totally recommend this product.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I use this with a Whirly Pop and it is a great combination!  As others have said...tastes and smells just like theater popcorn, due to the use of coconut oil.  Very few un-popped kernels, and total cooking time is just about 3 minutes on medium heat.  I just dump the whole packet into the popper and start cranking.  I don't think it matters if you dump only the oil first, even though it is pretty thick, but once heated it thins out.<br /><br />I will not use microwave popcorn anymore.  The taste can't be compared to this, no matter what brand you buy.<br /><br />We have a large family and have tried all sorts of brands of microwave popcorn, and none come close in taste to this.<br /><br />I would estimate that one 4oz pack makes just short of 2-3.5oz microwave popcorn bags.<br /><br />*Update* 8/25/11<br /><br />Ok, here is the scoops on this product.  I have tried to duplicate the taste by buying coconut oil, popcorn and flavacol salt flavoring.  Cooked it exactly the same.  The taste is close, but nope...not as good as this product from Great Northern.  Of course the final price is cheaper if you mix it yourself, BUT...the end taste is not as good.  I have tried the Act II buttery flavor popping oil instead of the coconut oil, and still the taste is not the same as this.  I often use Whirl butter topping on my popcorn, which tastes fantastic - but these bags from Great Northern don't need a thing as far as topping.  Trust me.  You will not go back to microwave popcorn again.  While cooking, you will swear you are in the movie theater!

review/summary: I will never buy another box of microwave popcorn
review/text: I love this popcorn so much.  I pop it in my Whirley pop stove top popper, and it comes out perfect everytime.  I just had a bowl and it was scrum-del-e-icious.  nowhere near as greasy as microwave popcorn, but still just as flavorful.<br /><br />Update 2012<br /><br />The first time I bought this popcorn it was so delicious, but I noticed when I received the 2nd box a few months later it wasn't nearly as good.  the popcorn was a little stale.  I thought it was because I switched to a new popcorn popper and it was over steaming the popcorn.  Now after reading some of the current reviews I am a little scared to buy it again.  That's too bad cause it was once really good. I see the price has gone up a few dollars too.  So now you have to pay more for lower quality.

review/summary: Popcorn
review/text: The packaging is very convenient for the small 2.5 ounce popcorn poppers. The taste rivals movie theaters. The only negative is this is too salty. I do not know if it has to do with popcorn popper (it seems to have a large number of un-popped kernels)or just too much salt. We compensate by adding 50% more popcorn to the popper and this produces a much better product.

review/summary: Bad Taste! &lt;-- I was confused!
review/text: I was very confused when I wrote my first review. Yes, everything below was true but it was no fault of the product. The KEY to kettle style popcorn machines is proper temperature. The process to get big kernels is simple and is as follows:<br /><br />- Let the kettle heat empty for 5 minutes.<br />- Put popping oil in kettle and let it heat for another 5 minutes.<br />- Put in popcorn and salt and wait for the magic to happen.<br /><br />All of the problems I was experiencing below went away when I followed the procedure above. Popcorn pops real big and fluffy. I'm all out of corn right now and will be giving the Chiefs Choice brand a try to compare the two.<br /><br />--------------------OLD INACCURATE REVIEW BELOW -----------------<br />I had read a few other reviews here on Amazon that said this popcorn wasn't very good (Coconut oil flavor) and I have to agree. I thought I could suck it up and eat all of it but there is no way I will be able to do it. It's just nasty plain and simple. I'm using a Paramount popper and it works very well.<br /><br />My findings:<br /><br />- Kernels pop real small and are very chewy. Not big light and fluffy.<br />- Overall taste of the popcorn is not very good. Popcorn has a nasty coconut oil flavor to it. I thought maybe reducing the premeasured oil to half would help but it still has a coconut oil flavor to it.<br /><br />Overall, it's pretty bad and maybe I just ended up with an old batch or something because when you taste the popcorn you could swear that it's old. I'm hearing there is a brand called Chief's Choice and I will order some of that today and give it a try.

review/summary: great taste
review/text: got a popcorn machine as a gift for a basement family room.  have tried a few different popcorn oil products and been disappointed with the taste.  probably a little pricier to buy everything prepackaged this way, but the best flavor we've found.  very happy with our purchase & will definitely buy again!

review/summary: Good popcorn
review/text: This is good popcorn. I think it isn't salty enough for my taste, but I just add more popcorn salt to it. All the kernels do not pop, but it is still very good. We make it every weekend. Our company loves it.
