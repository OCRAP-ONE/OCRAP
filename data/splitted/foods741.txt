review/text: I have become addicted to this coffee. I had given up drinking coffe cause it made me sick, I tried many differents kinds of coffee, but my son bought this for me and I now drink a couple cups a day. It's so smooth. The only thing wrong is its so expensive, I know the proceeds go to Paul Newmans charity but still it's a bit pricey.

review/text: So I purchased this thinking it was gum, looking at the picture you might think so too, however upon close reading of the title, it does indeed say it's a fruit and seed BAR. So oops at me, but either way on to an actual review of this. It's not tooo bad, it has that "health food taste" if you bite it, but if you just like lick at it, it kinda taste the same as if you were to take a fruit roll up and just shove the whole thing in your mouth then just lick at it. Though once you bite it, it kinda has a "prune mixed with other dried fruit" taste, though what could you really expect, the ingredients are:<br /><br />Apple Puree, Apple Concentrate, Strawberry Concentrate, and Chia Seeds<br /><br />so eh, it's alright for being a natural bar thingy, however i wouldn't have paid 2 bucks for it if i'd known what it was.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: This is a high-quality product, and I agree with the first reviewer:  it would cost as much, if not more, to make this yourself from the same oils from retail bottles and jars. I've been making my own mayonnaise for years and while homemade is my favourite; with the price of top-quality, extra virgin olive oil right now, it just doesn't make any sense. And I'd hate to compromise with a lesser oil.<br /><br />This mayo is tasty as is and also takes very well to additions of lemon juice, minced garlic, dill, tarragon, and capers; as well as pureed roasted peppers, garlic, sea salt and cayenne pepper. I even use it for spicy tuna hand rolls:  mix finely chopped, sashimi-grade fresh tuna with some of this mayo, a bit of Nama Shoyu, Umeboshi plum vinegar, hot pepper toasted sesame oil and minced hot red chiles and scallions to taste. Now I'm all hungry.<br /><br />This is a great staple to have on hand, and will adapt to whatever you throw at it. Best of all, you can feel peaceful about eating the health-promoting fats in this mayo and avoiding the soy, canola, chemically treated salt and preservatives in the other brands out there.

review/summary: Mayo's Days in the Wilderness
review/text: I'm surprised there aren't a thousand reviews on this product which symbolizes full bodied, fueling flavor. It does have a quality collection of deserved praise, and a well earned, excellent sales rank.<br /><br />This product's information and ingredients disclosures are refreshingly clear, reading like a gourmet ad for rapture in texture and taste.<br /><br />The reality of receiving and using this mayo goes well beyond reflecting the truth in every word in its description.<br /><br />My beloved mayo was the first food I noticed, with grieving horror, which had been altered in the marketplace, in the name of heart "health."  When I realized what the change was truly in the name of, I didn't want to hold that sick awareness in my mind. Read THE DARK SIDE OF CINDERELLA by doctors Mary Enig and Sally Fallon, if you want a clue.<br /><br />The disappointed had gone to soul level, which I felt when seeing the oil switch in ingredients lists of nearly every mayo-type condiment stocked on supermarket shelves.<br /><br />The joy felt was absolute, when I discovered and experienced this family's courage to provide an alternate choice of a heavenly recipe.<br /><br />Sometimes what is done in the name of "health and public safety" has to be undone in the name of reality and sanity.<br /><br />Bless those who return dark machinations to right, light, and yum.<br /><br />I can't count the number of favorite food preparations I began to discontinue when I discovered that mayo had been brought away from its original healthy [IMO] recipe by the soybean push. Now I don't need a cosmic level calculator. I can return to the healthy spice of life in full measure... at least in uses of my beloved mayo.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon and Wilderness Family,<br />Linda Shelnutt

review/summary: Passable for a low calorie"treat"
review/text: The FedEx truck just dropped off my shipment about 10min ago. I couldn't help myself but open up the Cookies & Cream pint right away.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the top was REALLY hard to open. I had to almost rip it to get it opened. Actually I did rip one side of the cover.<br />The second thing I noticed was the color, it looks like a light colored black bean mush. Yeah, I know weird right?<br />But I mustered on.<br /><br />Picked up my spoon and tried to dig in. And tried and tried ... nope, the spoon only made a teeny tiny dent. So I nuked it for about 15secs. Finally I was able to get a taste.<br />Hmmm... can't really figure out what the taste actually is. Really, I'm not joking. It definitely does not taste like C&C. Don't get me wrong, it's not horrible or extremely unpleasant but definitely NOT C&C. It also has an after taste. I wish I could pinpoint what it tastes like but I really can't. Sorry.<br /><br />Then the last thing I noticed was after I nuked it for 15 sec, the melty product was a bit stringy. Rather strange.<br /><br />I'm disappointed in the C&C flavor.  I haven't given up on this product line yet because:<br />1. It has 32% of your fiber in the whole pint.<br />2. On a bad day with the kids, I can see wanting to eat a whole pint of ice cream by myself and this might just save me from that.<br />3. You'll work off the calories you eat just by scooping the frozen "ice cream" from the container... :D<br /><br />On to the Strawberry.<br />I finally had a chance to try it after it sits in our freezer for a couple days. I found that I had to let it sit on the counter for awhile again before I could scoop it out.<br />The taste is a little bit better than the C&C. It has a tiny bit of the strawberry taste but definitely not like strawberry ice cream in any way or form.<br />It's more the consistency of a sorbet than ice cream.<br /><br />I probably will try the other flavors to see if there is one that I could strongly recommend. However, if these are the only 2 flavors available I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone based on the taste and cost.

review/text: Walkers shortbread thins are a favorite at my house but hard to find. I was thrilled to find them on Amazon even though the price was more than a retail store. But the shipping was free in this case so I bought them. The cookies arrived bundled in a set of 4 boxes as expected. However, every cookie in each box was broken. This does not change the quality taste of these cookies (butter, lemon and raspberry choices) but it definitely limits serving options. I will not likely serve broken cookies at a party or special occasion. I was very disappointed that all the cookies were broken, none were intact. I will be highly hesitant to buy them through Amazon again.

I can not comment enough on how wonderful the crystallized lemon zest is in this cookie. I love lemon flavored cakes, cookies, etc...and these exceeded my expectations. Soft vanilla, lemon flavor--almost like a nice lemon pound cake--mixed with the buttery-ness of shortbread and bits of sweet chewy lemon zest! Absolutely not bitter, sour, or harsh. We also got the walker's stem-ginger shortbread (crystallized ginger pieces)! Perfection! I highly recommend both for fans of good quality, Scottish, shortbread cookies.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQ18K">Walkers Shortbread Lemon Thins, 4.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> are outrageously delicious thin shortbread cookies, but when ordered in this manner, many were broken.  That doesn't detract from the taste, but it definitely is not great when you need each cookie to be intact for presentation purposes.  It makes for a more expensive desert because more boxes are needed.  On the plus, you can eat the broken bits and they are still delicious!  I recently baked lemon butter cookies which everyone thought were fabulous, but the Walkers thins are more tart and the larger shreds of lemon zest put mine to shame.  I will use this discovery to increase the grated size of lemon peel in my next batch of lemon butter cookies, but will not be baking them for some time because we will be enjoying the Walkers cookie pieces instead.  (Had to go to the store to buy more!)  The whole shortbread is attractive and tasty, so I'll be continue to purchase them in local markets now.  The general consensus around here is that they are even better than the other Walkers Shortbread cookies we've tasted, because the tartness and texture of the lemon zest takes the shortbread to the next level.  Because the others are thicker and less delicate, we'll continue ordering them from Amazon.  These thins are a definite winning treat to dunk in a cup of tea or include with a frozen desert.  Highly recommend these packaged cookies.

review/summary: Tasty but too many broken cookies
review/text: Cookies were tasty, but half of them were broken.  They were packaged very well, but when I opened the boxes and pulled out the tray of cookies, they were mostly in pieces.  I still have 2 more boxes to open so we'll see how those are yet.  Probably would not buy them from this seller again.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: While it is true that items like these tend to be a little riskier in shipping, mine came in perfect condition, not a broken cookie to be found.  However, that's likely luck of the draw when you're talking about a cookie like this that's so easily breakable.<br /><br />The cookies, though, are delicious.  The "thins" in the name scared me a little, wondering if the buttery flavour might be lost in a thinner form because they might have to be cooked longer for crispness.  No worries there.  This cookie is all Walkers, and the lemon flavour was fantastically distinct without being overbearing or overwhelming.  This is perfection for afternoon tea (low tea) or just a lovely cup of tea whenever you choose to take it, and the balance of tart and sweet is great whether you prefer the English tea blends or something like a fragrant jasmine green.

review/summary: Delicious treat for fans of lemon & shortbread
review/text: I love Walker's shortbread, and I love lemon desserts (lemon meringue pie, lemon bars, mmmm!) I never knew these existed until it popped up as a lightning deal recently. As it happens, there was also a special offer for a discount on Walker's shortbread going on at the time. I saw the previous reviews that suggested the flavor might be a little TOO lemon-y and that there had been shipping issues, but due to the discounts I decided to give it a try. I had already decided it was likely I'd be the only one eating them -- the rest of my family is not so interested in lemon -- so I wasn't concerned if the cookies were broken. As it happened, the box they were shipped in did have some damage, but it hadn't actually touched the cookie boxes inside. The 4 boxes come shrink-wrapped in a cube shape (2 stacks of 2 boxes), which may help protect them somewhat. I've only opened one box so far, but ironically since I don't actually care if they're broken or not, all of the cookies in that box were perfectly fine & unbroken. I don't know if they've improved their shipping/handling process or if I just got lucky.<br /><br />As far as taste, if you like lemon dessert and shortbread, I think you'll probably like this as well. Since it's shortbread, it's not overly sweet as some lemon treats are, but I thought the shortbread and lemon flavors went together extremely well. I did notice some very small granules of chewier bits (probably pieces of the lemon zest) which may have been what the earlier reviewer's relative noticed. I thought it actually gave an interesting texture to the cookie. It's fairly subtle. If I have a complaint, it's that each box contains a total of 12 cookies -- pretty pricey on a per-cookie basis.<br /><br />I had thought i might take some of these with me to share when we visit family over the holidays, but honestly I don't think they're going to last that long!

review/summary: Scrumptious!
review/text: I'm going to have to order more.  Just looking at the photo as I write this review, I'm starting to drool.<br /><br />I love shortbread cookies but I'm too lazy to make them.  I'm a perfectly capable baker, and when I retire, I will bake my own.  I forget what brought these to my attention, but I ordered them and they were a hit at home and at work.  OK, those heathens at work never met a cookie they didn't like, but they SCARFED them!<br /><br />Thin, crisp, light and buttery, with really yummy lemon flavor.  Not one person said anything about the lemon rind.  It's so fine you have to try to feel it in your mouth, but it sure tastes good.<br /><br />Some of the cookies were crumbled or broken.  This does not affect the flavor!  And they were shipped from Scotland.  Considering how easily shortbread breaks, I think they made the trip very well.<br /><br />I have to stop writing now, or I'll order more this instant!

review/summary: The best bread crumbs...you'll never go back
review/text: Panko bread crumbs are just awesome.  When used for breading they make a light yet crispy coating...The are different than traditional *american type* crumbs in the way that soft powder snow is different than heavy packed snow.  <p>The crumbs themselves are larger and irregularly shaped so as they lie on eachother they don't form a dense compressed breading but one with substance that still remains airy.  Their flavor is very light and seasoning is needed but this is a plus for me as I can season to taste.<p>I have also mixed these with traditional bread crumbs at times as these tend to be expensive for a lighter style coating but still essentially very much like all panko dishes.  I tend to use a light egg wash with these as I find using just eggs to dip the meat/poulty/fish in a bit heavy for these crumbs.  <p>In general I find these far superior for coating food.  These aren't the kind of bread crumbs I use for adding bulk (ie meatloaf, meatballs etc).  I have been using these for a few years now an there is a huge difference between these and the others.  I think if you try them you will really enjoy the light crisp crusts you can achieve...

Panko are used for katsudon, tonkatsu or cutlets served on rice or in soups. The cutlets, pounded chicken or pork, are coated with these light and crispy crumbs and fried. They are not gritty and dense like regular crumbs. They are very nice on deep fried shrimps and decorative for a more gourmet touch.

review/summary: Huge Cracks Mysteriously Appear!
review/text: Seller packaged this item well for shipping, but the spring roll wrappers are terrible!<br /><br />This is not the first time I have used rice paper spring roll wrappers, but it is my first (and last) time using this brand!<br /><br />A few wrappers were damaged.  I expected that, and discarded them.  Many had holes in them.  I wasn't pleased about that.  I searched through the package, and found perfect ones, placed them in a pan of water, and watched two inch long cracks appear in them.  ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!  I threw away the first 7-8 that formed these giant cracks in the water - and eventually just gave up and put two wrappers in the water at a time (rotating one by 90 degrees - so the cracks were in different directions).<br /><br />Please understand - they are not splitting because I was rough with them; or because I used something sharp to pick them up; or because I overstuffed them... they are splitting in the warm water.  The wrapper appears fine when it goes in, and as it softens, multiple large cracks (1/2" to over 2" long) split the wrapper.  Maybe the machine that pressed the pattern into them wasn't calibrated properly?  Don't know...<br /><br />Sure - you can use them... but you have to use two at a time.  It is like making a sandwich and having to use 4 pieces of bread to hold it together.  Ridiculous!

review/summary: My favourite Earl Grey
review/text: Clipper is my favourite brand of Earl Grey tea.  I've tried many brands over the years.<br /><br />I used to stick with good old Twinings, but they seem to have changed their UK Earl Grey flavour in the last few years (it's now less appealing to me) and their US Earl Grey flavour is different (and inferior, in my opinion) to their UK Earl Grey flavour.  I once wrote to their customer service department to ask about the US and UK Earl Grey flavour differences, and they told me that their flavours are modified based on what the consumers in each country seem to like.<br /><br />I don't know if Clipper varies their Earl Grey UK and US flavours similarly, or not.  Up to now, I've only bought it in the UK.  I would go out of my way to find it there, because not every supermarket would carry the Earl Grey flavor by Clipper.<br /><br />I'm considering buying this pack of 6 in this listing, but I wish I could get just one box first, to make sure I like the US version (if indeed there is any difference).<br /><br />I had never seen any Clipper teas in a US store until last week, when I found a lone box of Clipper Chai tea (my favourite chai) in a small TJ Maxx store for about two dollars, and I snapped it up!  I've been back to the store to see if they have any more on display, but they don't.<br /><br />One difference I noticed between the UK Clipper Chai and the US Clipper Chai is that the US Clipper bags are individually wrapped in a little paper cover, whereas in the UK, tea bags that come in a box (of, say, 20 or 50 or 100) are usually not wrapped in their own individual covers.

(Maybe I would be as thin as he is, if I had that problem!)<br /><br />Of course, you should search for the lowest price available (including shipping); consider looking for these at a local store. Giant food stores in Virginia often carry them.

review/text: I discoverd this marinade by accident in a high end, high price, one of a kind specialty grocery store. They don't have it anymore and I have been looking for it ever since. I used this merinade on 4-5 T bones for a family gathering and assumed, like most, that they really don't do all that much and you need to leave them on longer. The meat was almost mush . . . almost . . . but extreemly good. Comments were made, "We've never had steak like this before!". (A good thing.) Everyone raved about the meat. You almost didn't need a knife! The other reviews are correct. I would definately NOT apply this over night. I'm wanting it now for Tri-Tip, which I usually salt cure for as much as 24 hours. I guessing that this marinade would turn a Tri-tip into a Felit. If you can find this merinade it is the bomb. I highly suggest following the instructions the first time just so you know what it does. I more the doubled the time and almost had baby food. GREAT STUFF AND I WANT IT! Time to call Kikkoman!

review/summary: A True Stand-Alone Marinade!
review/text: I pride myself on my ability to marinate meat.  Of course, all you do is dump the marinade over the meat and you're done, so my pride is kind of simplistic, but the right marinade is the key to making everything else fit together. Usually, I buy marinades and combine five or six (or more) different ones, adding spices and whatnot, until it tastes just right and then adding it.  This is the only marinade that I won't add anything to and, unbelievable to me the first time I used it, not only do you not have to add anything to it, but 10 minutes later, the meat is ready to go. No overnighting it! This marinade made one of three steaks I've ever eaten that I didn't use any steak sauce with. For those of us who require steak sauce, this statement should be "enough said".

review/summary: Drastic cost increases!
review/text: My 4 stars is for the original price!!! I bought a 35# bag of Hi-Tek Naturals Lamb Meal for Less Active and Large Breeds in 10/6/12 for $36.80. Only a week later it is OVER DOUBLE this price ($76.34 on 10/11/12)?? It is a good dog food, but for $36! It is not worth over 75 dollars! I hope they get such a decrease in revenue that they revert to their original price.<br /><br />As for this food itself, I do like Hi-Tek brand and have tried multiple foods. My dog likes all of them fine, and her stools are smaller, less frequent, less smelly. The fat content of this Less active formulation is 12% as opposed to the normal 16% ( Hi-tek chicken meal with sweet potato is my comparison, $47.38 for 30# on 10/6/12, $45.99 for 30# 7/7/2012). However, the protein is decreased from the normal food - this one is 21% and normal food is 32%. I believe this is a reflection in the decrease of the quality of ingredients. The first five ingredients in the Less active formulation are: Lamb meal, pearled barley, white rice, brown rice, whole milo (another grain) followed by pork meal and some vitamins. Seems to me, a smart person would just buy the regular food and add some rice! The first five ingredients of the regular formulation are: Chicken meal, sweet potato, peas, pork meal, egg followed by duck meal, salmon meal, and a bunch of fruits and vitamins.<br /><br />Bottom line: love Hi-tek, kinda upset about the price changes, this food is not worth a penny over the original formulation even though you get 5# more. In this food they just cut protein sources and fruits and added more "filler" like rice.

review/summary: Great Chocolate Milk Shake, if not really a 'shake'
review/text: I purchased this directly from ediet. The Chocolate Flavor Milk Shake Mix comes in a can, with a net weight of 12 ounces. Enough mix for two gallons of milk; or, two tablespoons per cup of skim milk. I place two or three cups of milk in the blender, add the mix, let it blend for a minute or two, and you have a great glass of thick chocolate milk. I make enough to fill a quart bottle; if it sits in the refrigerator for a bit it thickens quite nicely. Not really a 'shake' (which I associate with Ice Cream) but a very nice glass of thick chocolate milk. One cup (made with skim milk) is 130 calories, 2 grams fat (1/2 gram saturated), 10 mg of sodium (it is sugar free and low sodium), and 6 grams total carbohydrates (0 sugar!). My non-diabetic wife also loves it (she has her own quart of shake). Great for a sweet tooth. I shall be ordering more!

review/text: My husband and I did an extensive taste test of hard-to-find boutique kettle chips along with some of the higher-end, supermarket-varieties and found Madhouse Munchies to be the absolute TOPS! Crunchy yet delicate with a fresh potato flavor (nothing "off-tasting") and the perfect amount of salty goodness, they were so yummy we bought them by the case and hoarded them for months. Do not pass these up - they are TOO GOOD!

review/text: My husband and I are HUGE fans of salt and vinegar chips, so I was very interested to try the Madhouse Munchies variety when I came across the brand in the natural foods section of my grocery store.  I was a little skeptical at first because some natural food chips are super greasy.  Boy was I wrong this time!  Madhouse Munchies are crunchy and flavorful but don't leave behind a greasy mess.  We take the Sea Salt & Vinegar chips with us to every cookout and tailgate party and they are always a big hit!  We always leave the parties empty handed!!

Also not as "salty" as most BBQ chips.

review/summary: First 2-3 deliveries were great.  Last 2 ... not so much
review/text: Decided to try Madhouse Munchies based on the description and the positive reviews.  No ... the opinion of an Olympic skier made no difference whatsoever except to wonder who out there actually believed that an an olympic skier is a more qualified determiner of potato chip quality than anyone else.  Anyway - my first delivery showed these to be good chips.  5 star ... or nearly so.  Second delivery supported the first.<br /><br />I'll give it three stars an an average.  Chips, when well made and fresh are probably closer to 5 stars.  I can't quite recall where it turned but it was either the third or fourth delivery.  This next delivery showed up with the box itself soaked with oil and every single bag within the box slit down the back seam.  It should have been nearly impossible for the person packing it not to notice and its difficult for me to believe that 12 bags spontaneously burst down the back seam in transit.  I reported it, threw them all out and Amazon refunded the money (thanks Amazon).  Next delivery, while not split down the seam, were very very greasy.  The chips were practically dripping oil.  Most recent delivery ... same thing.  I'll chalk the split seam issue down to logistics but the last two scream of manufacturing process changes or cutbacks or simply a malaise in the process.  Whatever it is ... that's all it really takes to lose a customer.  Lay's makes an excellent kettle chip, best I've had to date, and they sell it at the local small market where we pickup our milk for $2.29 for an 8.5oz bag.  That's a better price per oz than I was getting here.  I'm off the Madhouse Munchies bandwagon.<br />Giving this 3 stars as an average but this chip has been on a 5 star to 1 star slide.  Clearly they know how to make a good chip.  For whatever reason they just stopped doing it.

The kids take them to school and keep them in their lockers or everyone just grabs a bag in the evening as a snack.  They taste great.  It's 6:00 in the morning right now and I can taste them as I write this...how quickly can Amazon get them here?<br /><br />The good news is that they are good for you (well as good as chips can be).  Not that I know a lot about this stuff but I read that they use "good" oils to make the chips so there are no trans fats (or something like that).<br /><br />Man, I wish I had some right now.

review/summary: The ULTIMATE chip!
review/text: I was first introduced to Madhouse Munchies on a visit to Vermont. After the trip, when the cravings started to hit, I went online and have been buying them online ever since. Braving the abuse of friends who frown on an online potato chip habit, I now find myself eating them alone (even before 5 o'clock!) and hiding them all over the place in case I need a nibble or two to get me through the day. I am always afraid of being found out, and work to hide my obvious potato breath. I know the ads say to munch responsibly, but I will admit that I am an addict (step #1, obviously). To all of you whom I have hurt, I'm sorry. But forget rehab: I will continue to let the chips fall where they may.

review/summary: I have only tried the BBQ flavor but...
review/text: ...they are not so good in my opinion. Described on the bag as light and crisp, they are anything but. These are thick chips made double thick by all the flavorings which is just so over-done, it is falling off into the bottom of the bag. You get about 6 actual chips with loads of orange flavor dust in the bottom of the bag, and it's not the kind that you can dump into your mouth at the end, it is sooooo salty. I bought these for vending (1 oz size) because the Kettle Brand BBQ (which IS good btw) has never come back in stock since I purchased them this past summer. The price is not bad on the madhouse chips but now I have way too many that I will not be able to sell very well (72 pack).<br />I'll probably end up giving them away.

review/summary: The perfect potato chips.
review/text: I discovered these chips for the first time while vacationing with my wife in New Hampshire last fall.  Wherever I travel, I'm in search of excellent potato chips, and these clearly rank with the best I've ever eaten.  Taste wise, these chips have the right balance between the natural potato flavor and the French onion flavoring, with just the right "crunch."  And what truly amazed me was how such a great tasting chip could have so many natural nutrients and so few calories per ounce.  When we returned to Ohio, I ordered a whole box of the 5-ounce bags to give to friends and relatives this Christmas.

review/summary: Extremely disappointing - chips were made in 2007 and the oil in them was rancid
review/text: I am very disappointed with this purchase.  I don't think it is the product itself but rather how old the chips were that were shipped to me.  The first bag I opened were pretty good and I was feeling happy with my purchase. However, when I went to eat another bag I opened it and it had a very strong smell of rancid oil that dominated any salt and vinegar smell or flavor.  I then opened 2 more bags and they had the exact same issue.  Chips in these bags were essentially non-edible or at least not in<br />anyway pleasant to eat.  Rancid oil can't be a good thing to consume.  Looking closely at the chips sent to me I saw they were manufactured in 2007 and have an expiration date of January 2011 - clearly they have already expired.  This item is not returnable so I will be throwing all of the remaining bags of chips out.  That means I will have spent almost $42 for one good 1-ounce bag of chips.  So if you are thinking of buying such an item on amazon first inquire about how old the product is that will be shipped to you - I will definitely be doing that in the future.

review/text: These chips are very good.  Crunchy and tasty. Just the right amount of salt. Yet, I really don't see much of a difference as far as the chip being any healthier or a lot more tasty than other kettle chips. They leave your fingers very greasy. (I guess all kettle chips do that though). The bottom of every bag was full of broken, greasy pieces of chip. Maybe my shipment just got banged around too much. They DO taste good and it is hard to put them down.  I finish off a bag every time I open one. (I am not a big eater either) I try to eat a sandwich with them as to not polish off a whole bag at one setting:)Overall, I would try these again.

However, they are still quick to be bought by the staff because they taste so darn good.<br /><br />If they would only make 2 oz. bags for the same price!<br /><br />One last thought:  I live in the Rocky Mountains and the shipping went over the passes in Colorado.  Some of the bags lost their air and became vacuum packed as they came back down.  The chips were OK, but the bags looked like they had nearly nothing in them!  This is the case for many air packed and sealed items I buy East of the Rockies.

review/text: I consider myself somewhat of a potato chip expert having indulged my craving for over 55 years.  I first discovered Madhouse Munchies Sea Salted chips during a two year stay in Vermont close to where they're made.  I missed that lightly salted flavor when I moved back home.  It was a pleasant surprise to find them at Amazon.  If you like potato chips with a crunch, that aren't so thin they have no substance and with just the right amount of salt, this is it.  I rate these chips among my top three favorites.

review/summary: Happy snacker.
review/text: I've recently had to change my diet and cut down on salt.  I'm a salt-aholic so this wasn't easy.  I found Madhouse Munchies chips in a Gourmet Kitchen store and I was amazed at how good they taste.  They have about half the sodium of other chips but taste delicious and satisfy the salt craving.  The store that carried these is far enough away that I don't get there often so I checked the internet.  I'm able to get a case of 12 bags delivered right to my door for a reasonable price.  Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: I love these chips
review/text: I am not a potato chip lover.  I'm never on the hunt for a salty snack but I will go out of my way for these.  They always taste fresh and crispy and I can tell from the flavor that the company has gone out of there way to use quality ingredients.

review/text: I've been spoiled and can't eat any other chips anymore!  However it's a good thing I've been ordering them by the case as I noticed that the bags are not all the same weight.  Has anyone else had this problem?

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: I love salt & vinegar chips and these are by far my favorite ones I've had.  All my friends have enjoyed them too!  The 1 ounce bags are particularly great because its a one serving size package, so you don't eat to many!  I think these have a stronger vinegar flavor than many other types I've tried but its a much more pleasant one because it tastes like a good quality vinegar.<br /><br />Very recommended!

review/summary: Solid
review/text: Bought this during the grocery deal to give it a try--since I am a fan of salt and vinegar chips.  The product delivered a great taste and was able to finish the box off in about a week or so.  With that said, I kind of hoping for a little more chip per bag, but besides that it was everything I expected and more. Thank you.

review/summary: Madhouse Munchies Sea Salt & Vinegar Potato Chips
review/text: Do you have the Munchies?<br /><br />Light, non-oily, crispy with a balanced salt content, and perfect taste bud tang, Madhouse Munchies are highly recommended for those with a salt-and-vinegar fondness. This snack is made from select North American potatoes and is quite tasty, the way human nature intended.<br /><br />The only possible downside to this delight is the ingredient LACTOSE, which affects those allergic to milk.  Perhaps the company may consider an alternative version of these chips to satisfy a greater population.<br /><br />However, as they say, "because we cook with healthier oil [non-hydrogenated canola], chips are cholesterol free, 0g trans fat p/s, and has no MSG, preservatives, or artificial colors.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Packing a lunch just got better
review/text: My niece put us on to these and they are great. I have tried several of them. All are good, but I like the vinegar ones best. I have a fridge in the garage and I keep apples, diet soda and frozen one person meals there, along with a case of 24 of the vinegar munchies on top. On the way to the car I grab one of each and lunch is taken care of - and something to look forward to.
