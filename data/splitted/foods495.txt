review/text: Makes great brownies.  I've only tried it with yogurt, not sour cream or apple sauce as also suggested.  Very good and fudgy.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't get it again, the ingredients are pretty simple, I'll probably just make it myself next time, from scratch with egg whites and yogurt instead of whole eggs and oil.<br /><br />I do like how there is the one serving recipe instructions.  I've never used it but it's thoughtful.

review/text: I like these because they taste like regular, full-fat brownies.  The texture is moist and chewy, and the flavor is nice and chocolatey.  Perhaps the best part is that they are so easy to make.  All you need to add is fat-free yogurt.  Yay!!

I am a chocoholic and these are my favorite!!!

review/text: This is an awesome product. I work at a weight loss camp as a nutrition and culinary instructor, which means that one of my duties is to serve snack to the campers twice a day. This one is a FAVORITE around here with the kids AND staff! You can prepare it using applesauce or yogurt, like the box says. Both come out really awesome. They do tend to be a bit gooey when you cut them--not a huge problem though! There is enough stability to cut pieces and serve them for sure. Awesome product. I will be purchasing some when I go home from camp!

review/summary: They taste decent, but not at all like real brownies.
review/text: I usually buy real brownies, but these intrigued me so I wanted to try them. I could tell they would be too sweet for me after licking the batter spoon and I was put off by all the cocoa dust that flew out when I dumped the package. They were easy to make though and cooked just fine in cupcake liners. They made about 12 cupcakes. I ate maybe 3 with LOTS of milk and then dumped the rest in the trash. It's not that they taste horrible, it's that they taste absolutely nothing like real brownies. They taste like dark chocolate and sugar goo, in my opinion. I can't stomach diet drinks or anything made with beet sugar or fake sugar either, so I'm not surprised that I hated them.<br />I just realized that, to me, they taste very much like Snackwell's devil food cookies. I never liked those, but I know plenty of people that did.

review/summary: Good brownies to eat with ice cream
review/text: I'm not on a diet or anything, my husband just bought these because they were on sale at the local grocery store and was intrigued by the Just Add Yogurt label (we are huge yogurt eaters). These are pretty decent brownies: almost-normal consistency, fudge-y taste (batter was amazing!). But there is a slight odd after-taste (fruity? cocoa powder?), if you have sensitive taste buds and are used to the standard brownie. To get by that, just eat these with ice cream or whipped cream and strawberries. (Although that kind of defeats the purpose of the fat-free I guess). I probably won't buy these again just because I love regular ol' brownies. But these were fun to try.

review/summary: Best way to make them
review/text: One package is 12 servings. 2 WW PointsPlus per piece if you are keeping track. Add the batter to a new shiny 12 spot muffin tray, which I spray with non-stick spray first. I usually cook for about 375 degrees for about 30 minutes. These will come out very crispy around all the edges. To prevent me from eating them all in one day, I throw them in a tupperware container in the freezer, and grab one when I need it. Thaws very quickly, or throw in the microwave for about 10 - 15 seconds for a crispy outside and a warm soft inside. Also add low fat whipped cream topping if you want, we keep ours in the freezer, which makes it almost like ice cream. I use non-sweetened generic brand applesauce instead of yogurt, and add a little vanilla extract just as the recipe on the box recommends. I have made it w/o the extract and really no difference.

review/summary: My Fave Diet Brownie!
review/text: I, too, adore these brownies. Perfect taste and texture. What I do, is make them in mini muffin tins (a whole box makes 24!), put them in individual bags right after they have cooled (3 mini muffin sized brownies equals out to 198 calories), and I throw them in my freezer. When I want a sweet snack mid-afternoon, or after dinner, I just grab a bag out of the freezer. I am not tempted to 'eat the whole tray', or even 'eat them before they get old', because they are pre-portioned and frozen. :)

review/summary: Sinfully delicious without the guilt
review/text: You would never know that these are fat free brownies based on the taste and texture. The best part is that the mix can be used to make single portions, perfect for people like me who like a yummy baked good as an occasional treat but don't want the temptation of an entire pan of brownies. A quick zap in the microwave and you've got a warm brownie. Cooked according to instructions, brownies are cake-like, but you can reduce the cook time by a few seconds for a fudgey brownie. Even my kids love these - and they normally turn their noses up at light or low fat versions of desserts (which is often justified). Highly recommend!

review/summary: Amazing!!
review/text: My absolute favorite treat is a brownie. I love these chocolatey dense squares with their crunchy, chewy edges. I couldn't believe it when I bit into these and found they met every expectation I would have for a brownie! I've tried so many low fat brownies and have always been disappointed but these are AMAZING brownies! I enjoyed them 100% as much as a regular brownie! I couldn't believe how good they were and I wouldn't have known they were fat free if I didn't make them myself! I usually add an ounce of walnuts to the mix but they still come out to only 130 calories a brownie and that's a normal size brownie - not a 2 bite square. LOVE these! Thanks No Pudge for giving me delicious brownies again!

review/summary: Good, but too sweet
review/text: I don't generally buy fat-free products because they usually taste like crap.  These brownies are surprising good for a fat-free brownie.  However, they are a little too sweet (and this is coming from someone who has a major sweet tooth). Also, when you first eat one of these, they seem to taste really great, so maybe you'll have another . . . and another.  But by the time you start the third one, you'll notice a slight aftertaste of some kind, like it's missing something important (and it is:  fat).  So, these aren't bad to ride out a sweet craving, but they're definitely not as delicious as "real" homemade brownies.

review/summary: a chocoholic dieter's staple
review/text: I love chocolate, and it was really difficult for me to give up my usual brownies, chocolate chip cookies, etc. when I started eating healthier about a year ago. Thankfully, I discovered No Pudge brownies, which satisfy the chocolate cravings and sweet tooth. I always have a pan of these brownies in my fridge, and I've still lost almost 100 pounds.<br /><br />Though No Pudge makes different flavors of brownies, I always get the original flavor and use different flavors of yogurt to get differently flavored brownies. I like to use black cherry or strawberry yogurt. Top one of those brownies off with a small scoop of frozen yogurt and you have an amazing dessert for only a couple hundred calories. You can also add dried fruits (I like dried cherries) to the mix before baking, and they turn out great. This mix is really versatile, and it always bakes up absolutely perfectly.

review/text: I love this brownie mix because it's so easy and doesn't require ingredients that I don't normally have (I don't stock eggs and oil in my fridge/pantry).  The end result is a product that has a texture that is more similar to cake than it is to a fudgey brownie (or says my husband).<br /><br />One caution:  do not overbake, otherwise the brownies become extremely tough and hard and not-so-delicious.  The box recommends a baking time of 30-35 minutes when poured into a standard 9x11 pan.  If you use mini-muffin pans like I do (either 12-count or 24-count), I would recommend reducing the baking time to 25-30 minutes.

We'd been getting them from our local grocery store for a couple of years now, and were so excited to see them on Amazon Subscribe & Save. I don't care what others may tell you, these brownies taste exactly like regular. They are incredible. The raspberry and mint are also incredible. You mix the package contents with one container of fat-free vanilla yogurt (we ALWAYS use Yoplait)...so simple and so good. Which reminds me - besides being easy, delicious and guilt-free, you can burn some calories making them! Lol. The batter becomes so thick, you really have to crank it. But it's SO worth it!

I only cooked them about 30 mins and they were done.  They turned out really fudgy.  Let them cool completely.  It is a little bit of a pain to portion since they are so fudgy they stuck to my SS spatula I was using to cut. They are delicious.  You can't go wrong here.  My husband thinks they are OK.  He likes full fat ghiradellis.  Def try them out.  I'm curious about the other flavors.

review/text: I was hesitant to buy No Pudge Fudge Brownie mix. I thought that fat free would mean that the brownies would taste nothing like brownies or maybe the brownies would have an odd consistancy. How could not using oil but yogurt give that chewy brownie texture that I love? I am pleased to say that all of my worries were for nothing! These brownies are AMAZING! I love that I can make a single serving which is perfect if I need a chocolate fix. My 10 year old picky son loves them! If you want a special treat you can mix the brownies with a flavored yogurt...raspberry or blueberry are to die for! I recommend No Pudge Fudge Brownie mix to those that love brownies but not the fat!

review/summary: Light & Rich! I'm never going back!
review/text: I read an article about No Pudge brownies somewhere and made a mental note to try it out someday. My grocery store now carries them so I thought I'd give them a try. I use fat-free plain yogurt and two drops of vanilla extract (which honestly doesn't really make a difference at all if you don't have any; I've tried both ways) and they still come out faaabulous! I make them all the time for girls' night-in; it's always a favorite! In my house, these brownies have never seen the light of dawn -- they go fast. :) I love sweets and baked goods but I stay away from them to keep in shape. I'm serious when I say that I don't have to worry with these brownies (even if I splurge on a couple extra pieces..out of 12). For some reason, I don't gain an inch! They're filling yet light, moist, rich, and are composed of the perfect texture ..not being too chewy, dry, or cake-like. Make sure not to over-bake them to the point that the top gets lighter and dry. If you see it start to happen and your brownies aren't ready, cover the top of your pan carefully with aluminum foil and it should be fine. I recommend this to everyone. I hope they never go out of business haha.. I plan on using their mix for life.

review/summary: A Dieter's Staple
review/text: I've lost 89 lbs since January of 2010, and I wanted to say that these have been a staple of my dieting. I'm not saying this was the only dessert I had but I have to say that it was one I had most frequently and still continue to have!  My favorite way and practically the only way I've served this was the single serve. I'd take 4 large tablespoons, sometimes 5 of the mix, and then I'd add 2 tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce.  I felt that this would help combat the extra mix and guarentee this was not adding any extra calories or fat that the yogurt sometimes has, and more importantly, no extra sugar. I'd add this to a microsafe coffee mug.  Once in a while, I'd add a few extra treats: a teaspoon of chocolate chips, or a teaspoon of peanut butter (which DOES add fat), and sometimes if I have any, a very small spoonful of ice cream.  And I ALWAYS add a small dose of low fat whipped cream to the top.  Part of dieting means treating yourself, and while I have this sometimes a few days a week, I never noticed a weight gain while consuming this.  This stuff is wonderful!!

review/text: If you are looking to watch your caloric intake but still love the taste of a pretty yummy brownie - then this No Pudge brownie is for you... 120 calories per brownie (and it is a decent size) 4 different flavors (mint, raspberry, cappacinco and original)... yum!  and considerably cheaper than buying them in the store.

review/summary: Great fat free brownies, even non-dieters like them
review/text: Even non-dieters love these.  1 box, made as per instructions (I use a 6oz container of nonfat vanilla yogurt usually) makes 1 pan, but I find that it makes a decently thick brownie if you use an 8x8 pan and adjust cooking time accordingly.  I couldn't spread the whole batter out into a larger pan. The batter is very thick and when all you are adding to the box of powder mix is a small carton of yogurt, it seems unlikely that that small amount of yogurt will turn a bowl of powder into a bowl of batter but if you keep stirring, it does happen. I also tried it using nonfat plain Greek yogurt plus a tsp of vanilla but it was too thick so I had to add a few tablespoons of water and then the batter came out perfect and the brownies were just as great as always. I like that you can do single servings in a bowl in the microwave (I double these as they are pretty small).  These brownies are not as gooey and flakey as a regular decadent type but they have more a thicker chewy-ness (like a crust but not hard or flaky) on the bottom and outside edges that some people prefer.  For a nice treat, top these brownies with fat free Cool Whip and some sugar free chocolate syrup... diet brownie heaven. They sell this mix in my local supermarket and it's about $3-$5 depending on if there's a sale.  These brownies are very sticky when cutting them so it's also good to make them in muffin tins instead of brownie pans.

review/text: I made these brownies with Light Yoplait Vanilla Yogurt and they were amazing!  They were so moist and delicious.  I have recommended them to everyone I know!  They do stick to the pan a little more than average brownies, but I'll take that over super fatty brownies any day.  When you first start mixing these it may seem like there isn't enough yogurt in them to smooth out, but with a lot of stirring they'll end up mixing wonderfully.  I love these brownies and recommend them to anyone!

review/text: I was skeptical, but hopeful, that these would be as good as the other reviews led me to believe. These brownies are as fudgy and chocolatey as claimed and in my opinion taste as good as any full fat brownie I've ever had. I like my brownies more fudgy/chewy than cake-like and that's exactly how they came out following the standard recipe. If I didn't know, I would never guess they're fat free brownies.

review/text: I made a single serving in the microwave last night using a generic, low calorie, low carb vanilla yogurt. I was pleasantly surprised! It was so yummy. Very chocolatey. I had to add more than 1 tbsp of the yogurt, but only a tad. I have not baked a whole batch yet, as it is only me in the house, so I cannot comment on how they turn out in the oven, but the single servings are great.

review/summary: GREAT brownies!
review/text: This are a little more expensive than regular mixes but they are fat free and taste GREAT!  They don't sell them where I live so I asked my mother, who lives outside of Chicago, to check the prices at her local grocer. Turns out these are about 50 cents cheaper per box at Amazon. I tried them with and without the egg white (egg white makes a more cake like texture) and they great either way.  Definitely worth the money.  I'm making a batch for Valentine's Day with some raspberry preserves on top.

review/text: These are so easy to make, and they taste great!!!  Just add fat free vanilla yogurt, mix and microwave for a single serving...top with fat-free Cool Whip or frozen yogurt.  Can double the single serving and still microwave for just a little longer for a larger "single" serving.  Would suggest measuring when making single servings since much of a variation in the ratio of mix:yogurt will change the consistency of the brownie.

review/text: Our family loves brownies and these are great. Not only are they healthier for you they taste good. We like to add nuts to them. I was making them with yogurt but have switches to unsweetened applesauce. just a little tip. They are hard to cut so we tried making them in a muffin pan it works great. you get 12 individual brownies. Just grease the pan add the batter then bake for 22 to 23 minutes. about 2 minutes after taking them out of the oven get a fork and gently nudge one corner to get them out of the pan, do this to each one.then let them cool. works great. I like mine moist so I put them in an airtight container while they are not totally cooled. Enjoy these great brownies!!!!

review/summary: Tasty, but took hours to cook, wet inside
review/text: I'm not sure why it took about two hours in the oven to get these brownies to finally finish cooking.  I used a pyrex baking bowl, at the correct temperature about 8x8 and they just seemed to stay drippy in the center.  I did used a greek style yogurt, not sure if that matters. Does anyone have any tips or know what I did wrong?<br /><br />The aroma and flavor is fantastic. You'll never miss the fat, but watch the calorie count - it's still pretty high. Don't fool yourself into eating the whole pan.<br /><br />I later tried much cheaper Duncan Hines and substituted pineapple (puree'd) for oil.  While not at tasty as 'No pudge' brand, it baked on schedule and tasted nice. Substituting pineapple seemed to give it a slightly more cake-like texture.

review/summary: chocolatey, gooey, and delicious
review/text: I saw this box on the shelf at the store and hesitated to buy for a while. Then one day, I was craving chocolate and remembered no pudge, so I gave them a try and really enjoyed them. These brownies are a great substitute for full fat ones. These taste rich and decadent and are easy to make. Plus the ingredients are plain and simple. I top it with lowfat ice cream for the perfect hot/cold treat. Remember, fat-free doesn't mean calorie free. Instead of 12 (120 calories) servings, I cut them into 9 squares for 160 calories each. They are rich enough that you don't need a giant serving. Try them, they will definately satisfy your chocolate cravings. I'm not someone on a diet or anything, I just like eating better and tasty versions of my fav foods.

review/summary: These brownies are horrible
review/text: Here's a review by someone who is not fat, not on a diet, and who has not ruined his palate with fat free confections:<br /><br />These are the worst brownies I have ever tasted!  My wife bought this mix because it was the only one available at Trader Joe's when she shopped.  She didn't tell me they were fat free, but as soon as I tried one, I knew.  It had all the hallmarks of fat-free baked goods - gummy, flat, and the chocolate tasted like cocoa powder, not like rich fudgy chocolate.  I almost had to spit it out, it was that awful.<br /><br />And do you want to know why fat free foods taste so bad?  I'll let you in on a little secret:  the secret ingredient in good-tasting food is... you guessed it - FAT!!!!!  Fat and oil molecules transport the lovely taste of foods onto your taste buds.  So stop being so afraid of fat!  A little bit won't kill you!  Just exercise a little self-control and don't eat the entire box.  One properly made brownie is more satisfying than a whole plate of these vile things.<br /><br />So if you like real food that tastes good, don't believe the reviewers that raved about these brownies.  These people have a hidden agenda - they are trying to convince themselves that these little nuggets of evil actually taste good and are good for them.

review/summary: too salty for a general purpose rub
review/text: Maybe OK for a boston butt, but as a general purpose rub I find it too heavy on the salt. Admittedly, just how salty is "too salty" is a highly subjective thing, and some others obviously like this rub quite a lot. But looking at the nutrition info on the label, the sodium content in this rub is substantially higher than most other commercial rubs/seasons I've tried. So just be forewarned that if your salt preference is more on the conservative side, this may not be the product for you.

review/summary: Beware of the good reviews this is a very salty rub
review/text: I bought this product due to all the good reviews.  I bbq using a weber smokey mountain often.  I usually make my own rubs.  I thought this might be a good product to keep on hand in case I didn't feel like making a rub.<br /><br />Most good bbq rubs have a base of salt and brown sugar.  This rub does not contain any sugar.  It is however very heavy on the salt.  I am used to using a large amount of rub when bbq to get a nice bark.  I made some ribs using this rub and they were so salty they were almost inedible.  I tasted the rub before hand and cut it with some brown sugar but clearly not enough.<br /><br />I have used this rub on other foods and had better results.  A little is very delicious on french fries or corn on the cob where I use this in place of salt.<br /><br />If you intend on using this rub heavily for low and slow cooking plan on cutting it heavily with brown sugar.  I prefer a salty spicy rub over an overly sweet rub but this is too much on its own.  I just wish they used more of the other ingrediantes and less salt as the spice is very tasty.<br /><br />If you plan on using this to spice up other foods in place of salt you may be very happy with this.

review/text: This is the best rub i have found or even made. No need to drive yourself crazy trying to perfect your own rub, they have done it for you.<br />With butts and whole chickens/turkeys it is great. On ribs go very sparingly, it can overwhelm them! I also like to melt this in water/applejuice/vinegar/butter and inject it directly into the butts (10 to 12LBS typically). I like the keep the butts in the "shrinkwrap" they come in from BJ's overnite then put the rub on at least 4-6 hours prior letting the meat come up to room temp in a bag till it is soaked in then i add another sprinkling. I got a "pizza" shaker type metal shaker that makes the application easy and it works out great. I slow smoke often and 1 gallon of this lasts me right around a year but I use it for everything! Really is worth the money, you will not regret it, just go easy on the ribs as it is a bit salty ad full flavored.

review/summary: Peppery, smokey goodness
review/text: The only problem with this rub is that I thought I was getting the jar, not the large size container.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing. It's like everything that tastes good on charred, dead animal flesh got together and conspired to bring the world a delicious alternative to salt and BBQ Sauce. I strongly suggest liberally coating on chicken, pork, beef, and anything else you can get your hands one. I spilled some on eggs once. Those eggs came to life, fried themselves, found some bacon to pair up with, and plated themselves while pouring me a glass of delicious orange-mango-pineapple juice.<br /><br />I love this more than Penzey's seasoned sea salt, johnny's sea salt, penzey's barbecue dust, and puppies. If you knew how much I love puppies, this last sentence would cause you to gasp in amazement.

review/summary: Great on everything, low sugar for real BBQ
review/text: I love this product,it's Dinosaur Cajun Foreplay and this for me! Equally good on chicken and pork, beef and fish. It is a bit salty because of the low suger levels, (so minimize burning) but that is what makes it good for real BBQ. It's still balanced enough to put on anything. Really really great rub, just buy the big one and never mind all the other $5 botttles of everything else! (except Dino, of course!!)

review/text: My husband and I use this on basically everything we throw on the grill or smoker. It's a good seasoning "go to" when you need something quick too. My husband is an avid BBQ eater, viewer, wanna be judge, and quite honestly, I prefer his creations over anything we've eaten at a restaurant. I digress from my review to give you that facet of our history in order to say other than a rub that we make to test, this is what we use now and for as long as we've had a grill. Usually the rubs we have made pass by the way side b/c we prefer this to anything else we've tried.

review/summary: Rub Your Butts !!!
review/text: ok  I was real skeptical on trying anybodys rub but I kept seeing this name come up time and time again on the BBQ competitions I was seeing on TV. So I google it and got it. I went to my local grocery store first and got the little bottle but it went so fast I had to get a bigger one. What a difference it makes to have a solid rub you can use on anything you cook. I use BBBR on almost all of my meat. It's a great base to any real cooks rub. I use it along with some other ingrediants I normally use and it's the real deal !!. The name says it all, Byron is one Bad dude !! If you are thinking about trying a rub other than your own then start with this one. You won't be disaapointed.

review/summary: GREAT rub!!!
review/text: Butt Rub is by far one of the best rubs you can buy. I normally make my own dry rubs (especially for some things like ribs and pork butt) but this stuff is delicious! It has the perfect amount of twang. I've tried tried it on steaks, burgers, pork chops, country style ribs, etc. and all with great results. But I find it is especially fantastic on grilled chicken and is almost the only thing I season my chicken with now. For those that say it is too salty, this is not a sweet rub nor is it meant to be, and there is a such thing as using too much!  Don't listen to them though, buy some and you definitely will not be disappointed!

Luckily, it was this delectable spice mix and not something funny :)<br /><br />Butt Rub is awesome on just about anything! If you go on the actual website, you can see the never ending list of possible culinary creations. Its awesome on meat, but also on texas toast (mix with honey, butter, and grated parmesan cheese, spread on the bread and toast in the oven), deviled eggs, homemade fries(or even the kind from the freezer)... there are tons of ideas to put it to good use!<br /><br />I recommend getting the big jar, we already ran out which is why I'm on this page tonight. And just in time for fathers day! It makes a great gift for a Dad that loves to bbq.

review/text: East of Paris is Meaux and environs.  This is the ancient home of true brie.  This is one of the two or three best.  It is not expensive, even when you add another third for shipping.  This is a big six pounder wheel.  You are paying for proper storage.  You can even cut it in quarters and freeze three for up to six months if you wrap tightly in a double freezer wrap paper.  Stored properly, this cool ripening takes two months to fully develop.  Muscular, but never sharp, this 45% minimum FBD (yep, FAT) will make you forget all others.  Serve with sauterne to be completely debauched.  Otherwise a chalky, flinty white will be proper.  Hang the box when you are done.

review/summary: Definitely has helped!  Best price is here at Amazon!
review/text: An Update 6/29/2011:  We like this product enough that we are placing another order for 5 packages.  Of course this product cannot cure our dog, but because of this product, he acts like he is not hurting so much and we have put off the surgery.  We still haven't found a better price than that offered on Amazon.<br /><br />Original review 1/15/2011:  Our 9 pound schnauzer started limping, then his hind leg started collapsing inward at the knee. Our vet took x-rays which showed--in layman's terms--knee joint problems on both hind legs.  He said it was caused by "genetics".  We love this dog so much, but corrective surgery is in the thousands (per knee).  While we decide on a future course-of-action, our vet prescribed anti-inflammitory pills and Glyco-Flex III Mini Bite-Sized Chews.  Our dog loves these chews.  We tell him to come and get a "treat"--and he believes that it is and comes running.  Yes, running.  He is no longer taking the anti-inflammatory medication, but continues with the chews.  At the moment, his leg is no longer collapsing, but we can tell that the knee with the biggest problem is still painful and stiff--but not like it was just weeks ago.  This stuff will not solve our dog's problem, but it sure seems to have helped.  We are going to continue buying these chews for our dog--and if you do some comparative shopping, you will find that Amazon's price is almost half of what you'll see elsewhere.

review/text: I have heard that this product is excellent for maintaining or improving canine joints.  My dog who loves all other treats would not eat this chew. I even ground it up and put it in his food and he rejected it. He even rejected it when I put it in cheese.  My sensitive nose does not detect any smell, but apparently the perlin (an ingredient) has a strong scent to dogs. At any rate, I learned that for some reason , dogs who reject the chews like the tablets and vice versa. The tablets are chewable and  have the same ingredients, but, oddly enough, the PROPORTIONS  are completely different.  I have not tried the tablets yet. Although the chews are guaranteed, the seller refused to take the product back, until I involved Amazon :)<br />I cannot rate its effectiveness since my dog did not like it. In terms of flavor, I guess it receives  a poor rating!<br />PS I was forced to give a rating in order to print this review

review/summary: Full of flavor, not heat
review/text: Green chili sauces tend to be milder than their red companions, and this "Castillo Salsa Habanera - Green" is no exception.  It has a nice, tiny little kick to it, but it is mild enough that I could just pour it straight into my mouth.<br /><br />So, unless you don't have much tolerance for heat, you are buying this for the flavor, not the spice. And this does have a nice flavor.  It is a good blend of habanera, garlic, and some other spices, without being too vinegary or overpowering.  We had some fajitas for breakfast this morning, and this Castillo Salsa was poured quite liberally over them.  Delicious.<br /><br />It isn't quite as good as my favorite green salsa,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DIWWE">Blair's Jalapeno Death Sauce with Tequila</a> , but a bottle of this Castillo sauce can usually be found in my kitchen.

review/text: Works great in recipes. But I tried them in my coffee and it has a bit of a funny artificial taste. Will buy some flavours in the large size to continue to bake with.

review/summary: Liquid Stevia flavors
review/text: When I made this purchase it was under the suggestion of others. I was a bit hesitant, as I had not heard of stevia - liquid or otherwise. I am so pleasantly pleased with how little you have to use for sweetness and flavoring. I have used in coffee, tea, on fruits and in plain water. AMAZING!

review/summary: Product Description
review/text: "SweetLeaf Liquid Stevia Flavors Tin"  indicates to me that the flavor containers would have a storage tin, however they come with only a cardboard container.  The individal flavor containers are plastic bottles.  For the price, I expected a tin storage continer for ease of carrying the flavor containers in my purse. The flavors taste great, but the description of what is being sold is extremely disappointing.
