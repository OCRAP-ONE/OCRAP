review/text: I opened a can 5 min ago and am just eating it straight out of the can! It's THAT delicious!<br />I remember getting stir fry take-out Chinese and picking out all the straw mushrooms to eat first. This can embodies that childish mentality.<br />The mushrooms are cooked (as is pretty much everything in a can) and seasoned perfectly - not too salty so that when you add them to recipes you can adjust with your own soy sauce. These straw mushrooms are tender and perfect for last min add ons to any semi-home made meal!<br /><br />I don't know what's up with the reviewer bout the "spider in can". Everyone knows freak accidents happen on rare occasions (think, ever get a hair in your salad from a restaurant?) and I'm extremely doubtful of her claim since she posted similar reviews on every Polar mushroom product. Skepticism speaks: Did the reviewer find spiders in ALL different cans of mushroom??

review/summary: Tastes like health food, but not actually health food.
review/text: These bars are packaged fairly nicely; the individual sleeves have a cool, smooth exterior and a very Trader Joe's friendly design that's gender-neutral and age-appropriate for any adult, though I do not like that the box lays flat and takes up far more space in my pantry than it would if it stood up. But that's unfortunately the nicest thing I can say about them. The texture is on the dry side, and the flavor combination of the special cocoa blend with orange and cranberry ended up tasting very chalky -- it would have been improved by being either sweetened more or sweetened less. And the bar, which is quite small, is a whopping 200 calories, 6 grams of fat, and 34 grams of carbohydrates -- and with not large quantity of protein or vitamins/minerals to justify it. It may have the antioxidant power of a cup of green tea, but I'd find drinking that cup of tea quite a bit more pleasant (and easier on my waistline).

review/summary: Forget the name.  Remember the Taste.
review/text: Don't the name throw you.  "Eat. Think. Smile" isn't the easiest brand to remember, but their baked nutrition bars are certainly memorable in terms of taste.  I tried two varieties through the Amazon Vine Program, Oatmeal Raisin and Orange Cranberry, and I loved them both.  The bars are soft, chewy, sweet without being sugary, and decently sized (a little bigger than a Clif Bar, perfect for a between meal snack or a before-exercise pick-me-up).  Best of all, they were satisfying without being too filling.  I was a little doubtful about how the addition of cocoa would affect the flavors, but as it turned out, the cocoa was only detectable as a pleasant undertone and didn't overpower the Oatmeal Raisin or Orange Cranberry.<br /><br />When deciding whether or not to recommend a food item I have sampled for free, I always ask myself, "Would I actually pay for this product?"  In the case of "Eat. Think. Smile" nutrition bars, my answer was a resounding "Yes.  I prefer these to some of the other bars I buy at the store."  Therefore, I am pleased to be able to recommend them to you.  Eat.  Think.  Smile.  And enjoy.

review/summary: Disappointly bitter taste
review/text: I was excited to try this product, as I usually have bars for breakfast, but it is getting harder to find ones that have good nutritional profiles in breakfast-appropriate (i.e., non-chocolate) flavors.  I love cranberry, so this bar seemed nearly perfect, especially given that I checked out the nutritional content prior to ordering.  At 4 grams, the amount of protein was a bit low for my liking, but the bar made up for this by being low in both sugar (12 grams) and saturated fat (1 gram) while being very high in fiber (7 grams).<br /><br />The texture of this bar is the first thing that struck me as a bit odd.  Although it is moist (i.e., as opposed to hard and crunchy), it is not chewy; in fact, it breaks apart easily and is a bit on the crumbly side.  (I suppose it is somewhat similar to a a CLIF brand bar.)  The taste, however, was quite disappointing:  rather than the tart taste of cranberry or the sweetness of orange, I detected only a bitter flavor.  It tasted almost as if the bar had been flavored with the bitter rind of the orange.  There did seem to be little fruit pieces in the bar that may have been cranberry, but unfortunately, the unpleasant bitterness overpowered everything else.<br /><br />I thought the first bar that I tried was just okay, but the second one seemed worse, and now I'm afraid I might have to toss the whole box (which I HATE to do--I hate being wasteful, so I might try dipping them in yogurt or something just to get through them).  Perhaps another flavor by this brand would be better, but unfortunately, I can't recommend these.

review/summary: Cocoa flavored bar.
review/text: The Orange Cranberry bars taste very similar to Fig Newtons; however, they are a tad bit chalky. I really liked the soft texture and the cocoa flavoring, but I couldn't taste any of the cranberry orange. I like the size and shape of the bar. It's not too big or small. In terms of nutritional value, I compared it to my preferred Luna bar. The Eat Think Smile bar is 51g and the Luna bar is 48g, so they are almost the same size. The calorie count is comparable (Luna 180 vs. Eat Think Smile 200) and fat content (Luna 5g vs. Eat Think Smile 6g), which is good. Where it falls short is in vitamins. My Luna bar has 20% vitamin A, 20% C, 30% iron, and 30% Vitamin E. The Eat Think Smart Bar has 0% vitamin A, 6% vitamin C , 6% iron, and no vitamin E. I am sticking with Luna.

review/summary: Good taste, crumbly consistency, good on fiber, OK on protein and fat
review/text: There are broadly three types of nutrition bars.  One that attempt to emulate baked goods (cookie like), those that emulate candy bars (chewy, chocolatey) , and fruit & nut bars.  These fall in the first  (baked / cookie) category.  In that category it is very tough to get protein content very high, so at 4 grams per serving, these bars do alright.  Here is the rundown<br />- 200 calories<br />- 6 grams fat (1 gram saturated)<br />- 34 grams carbs<br />- 12 grams sugar<br />- 7 grams fiber<br /><br />So with the decent fiber, and low saturated fat, these are a good choice among the baked/cookie bars.  You'll need to supplement your protein intake elsewhere however.<br /><br />I like the taste, and think the chocolate brings a lot to the game here.<br />The consistency is generally OK when eaten fresh out of the box, but if you throw these in a bag and they get any rough treatment you will be eating crumbles.<br /><br />These are a good choice.  However if you are carb conscious I would instead recommend  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00623HOEE">Kind Fruit and Nut Bars Kind Plus Protein, Almond, Walnut and Macadamia 12 - 1.4 oz (40g) Bars</a> (fruit and nut category) or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V0QW3S">Betty Lou's Almond Butter High Protein Balls, Gluten Free,  1.75-Ounce Packages (Pack of 18)</a> ("candy bar" category)

review/text: This bar is by no means health food.  I would recommend any Kind bar over these.<br /><br />The are numerous sweeteners, including: brown sugar, dextrose, brown rice syrup and sugar.  The primary ingredients are corn, wheat and oats which makes for a dry and crumbly product.<br /><br />The taste, despite all the sugar, is bland and slightly bitter from the orange peel.  A drink is required.  It's hard to stomach without a glass of milk because of the dryness and poor taste.

review/summary: Convenient, but not very tasty
review/text: I ate and thought, but I wasn't able to smile after trying these. They had a number of negatives, and not much going for them. The best I can say is that they are convenient if you need food in an instant.<br /><br />The texture of the bar was a surprise. It was cakey, firm, and rather smooth:  I was unable to feel oatmeal, nuts or cranberries, although I could see the oats when looking at the bar.  I was completely turned off by the taste of these nutrition bars, because the bitter taste of orange skin overwhelmed any other flavor I might have enjoyed. Cranberry-orange is one of my favorite flavor combinations, so I had high hopes for this bar. I was unable to taste any cocoa, but that might be because I just finished my box of Valentine's Day chocolates. The bar is supposed to have more antioxidants than a cup of green tea, so they might be an option if you like orange peel and hate green tea.<br /><br />These bars weren't overly nutritious, either.  They pack 200 calories into a little 1.8 oz (51 gram) bar, and a quarter of that is fat. I was surprised to see that the bar had 10 mg. of cholesterol, which although it isn't a huge amount, it's not common to find it in the nutrition bars I occasionally buy. I presume it's because there are eggs in this bar. Between the eggs, soy, chicory, nuts, flour and milk, these bars have a lot of potential allergens. (The bars have more glycerin than any flavoring ingredient.  Glycerin can be an allergy trigger) I was not surprised to see that there is more orange peel than cranberry in this bar, and that there is less than 2% cranberry. There are few vitamins and not much protein (4 gram) in them, either.<br /><br />I can't think of a reason to buy this bar, unless one needed calories in an instant and had no other choice. Try a piece of fruit and a handful of nuts for a convenient lunch that tastes good, is healthy and travels well instead. If you want an Eat, Think, Smile bar that tastes better (but carries about the same nutrition,) you might want to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BPVB84">Eat. Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bar, Dark Cherry, 1.8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> instead.

review/summary: Have a glass of water or milk handy
review/text: Since my palate tends to be open to health food, I was not put off by the flavor of these soft orange cranberry bars. The texture however, is very dry. You must eat with a liquid at hand.<br /><br />Flavor analysis: I see the cranberries but do not taste them. I believe it is hidden by the cocoa, brown sugar, and whole grain flours. The orange flavor does seem to come through, albeit lightly. The walnuts flavor is also slightly hidden by the combination of previously mentioned ingredients.<br /><br />Texture: Best described as powdery.<br /><br />Miscellaneous: These could actually do with a little less sweetener. They don't seem as sweet as the oatmeal-raisin version, but  it still is quite sweet.<br /><br />Final Analysis: I can deal with the texture, but if I want a healthy snack, I would prefer that I didn't get that sugar rush feel. They are a decent size and have only 200 calories. That was a nice surprise. Since the cocoa powder dominates, I think it would be better to market these as "Cocoa Orange Cranberry".

review/summary: "Nutrition Bar" that lacks good nutrition and flavor
review/text: I ordered a box of these Orange Cranberry as well as well as the Oatmeal Rasin flavored bars through the Amazon Vine program. Frankly, I cannot think of why anyone would buy these alleged "health" bars. Each of these bars are 200 calories, have 7 grams of fat, 10 mg of cholesterol a whopping 34 grams of carbohydrate and only four grams of protein. Also, based upon Recommended Daily Allowances for a 2,000 calorie per day diet they don't provide any Vitamin A, 6% of Vitamin C, 4% of the recommended Calcium, 6% of the Iron, 8% of Thiamin and 10% of Magnesium. At the time of this writing, this Oatmeal Raisin Flavor bar was not yet available for sale but different flavored 12 packs of this same brand of bar sells for around $19. Not only do these bars fall short from a true health standpoint but they're not very good tasting either. They're not terrible but the consumer would definitely want to have it with coffee or tea. As a stand alone bar it's got kind of a chalky texture. There are so many truly healthy and good tasting bars on the market that I don't see this brand becoming a favorite in many households; certainly not in ours. I would have been mad if I had actually paid for these bars.

review/summary: A Satisfying Snack
review/text: When I first tried this oddly named snack bar:"Eat, Think, Smile, Baked Nutritional Bar" I was not especially impressed with it. Although I had to admit it was different from other snack bars that I have tried. By the time I was nibbling my way through the second bar I realized what the difference was in this Eat, Think Smile bar compared to those others --a proper balance of sweetness. They do not give a quick rush of sugar energy as some sports bars make a claim to do. These "E.T.S." bars are not overly sweet. A slight bitter taste of the chocolate helps to keep any cloying sweet taste away. The orange and cranberry flavors are interesting and add depth to the taste, but also not extra sweetness. I like them for this.<br />I am NOT against sweet tasting bars. But this one actually fills and satisfies my hunger well and quickly. I have not yet been able to eat an entire bar at one time. They stop the craving for a midday snack when I feel a little slow. In the past I would have been inclined to reach for some cookies or another, sweeter snack bar, but this is proving to be a healthier choice.<br />So, now I understand the meaning of the odd name. It describes the order of experience I have when trying this snack bar. First eat it; meanwhile it makes me stop and think about what the crumbly stuff in my mouth could be. And yes, the surprise about the taste did bring a smile and a light of discovery went off about why I like it, and why it is now an important part of my diet.

review/summary: OK Taste, Crumbly Texture
review/text: This is my review of the Eat, Think, Smile baked orange cranberry bar.  Here are my impressions after going through a box of them:<br /><br />*  Taste is OK - But just OK.  It is slightly brownie-like, with hints of orange and cranberry.  The flavor is somewhat confused to me, though, as nothing really comes through very strongly.  It tastes as something would that should be 'healthier' for you than this really is.  I tend not to like things that try to be something other than what they are, and that is what the taste of this reminds me of.  It's OK, and I wish I could say better than that, but I can't.  This is not a health bar (indeed most bars that tout their health benefits can't honestly claim to be health food) and it's not a candy bar... it's in between and it tastes like it.  The aftertaste strikes me as slightly bitter.<br /><br />*  Texture - The texture is slightly cakey, but a bit on the dry side... like a dry brownie would be.  Make no mistake that this will not stand the rigors of a day in your backpack or days in your purse.  Unlike denser energy bars that will bend and assume the profile of that book that's been pressing against it, this bar will be reduced to crumbs in a hurry.  I found this out the hard way, and every one seemed to be very prone to crumbs, whether riding in my backpack or right out of the box.  This is something to consider if you are eating at your desk or somewhere where you don't want to leave a trail of crumbs intentionally.<br /><br />*  Ingredients - Yes, this bar is baked, and that's good.  It is also packed with anti-oxidants in the form of natural cocoa powder, and that's good.  It is advertised to have more antioxidant power than a cup of tea.  And that's good.  But I like drinking tea, and I would never substitute a bar (even if I liked the flavor, which is not the case here) for a relaxing cup of tea.<br /><br />Visually, the bar is pleasing enough, with a fine texture and not reminiscent of other bars I know that look like greasy, compressed rabbit food.  The aroma is decent, too, but these two attributes are minor considerations, in the end, for something that you are supposed to want to eat, compared to taste and texture.  Ultimately, this bar misses the mark for me.  Yes, the ingredients make an effort to be healthful, but the bar also has a lot of sugars in it without the yummy sensation all those sugars ought to convey.  This is not health food; neither is it a decadent treat.  This reviewer would rather have a handful of almonds and a cup of tea, or a dark chocolate bar rather than this baked bar, in the end.<br /><br />Taste is very much a subjective matter, and this reviewer does not think this particular bar will be frequenting my shopping list.  My best advice, though, is to try one before you buy a whole box and judge for yourself.

Which is not a bad thing. :)<br /><br />However, the texture was the main failing, for me. I'm sure this is just an effect of trying to maintain some semblance of good nutrition, but the bars were a little dry and crumbly, like not-quite-right brownies. They aren't bad, but they kept reminding me of something really tasty... and not being that really tasty thing.<br /><br />Worth a try, if you feel inclined. Just don't eat them where crumbs will be a problem!

That might not be super convenient if you just want to carry these to school or on a hike in your backpack for when you need a quick, healthy boost. But it definitely makes them more palatable--trust me! In fact a nice hot tea makes them downright tasty if you're in the mood for such a thing; one of my favorite aspects is that they aren't too sweet.

review/summary: Healthy alternative to a brownie
review/text: This is a nice product.  Tasty.  Not as sweet as a brownie would be, but I doubt anyone considering buying a 'nutrition bar' is expecting that.  It does have a suprising amount of sugar which they have cleverly disguised in the ingredients list by using quite an assortment of sweeteners in various forms (some of which the average jo wouldn't recognize as such, I'm certain) but this is a game all the major players play--especially in those foods with the halo of health.  This gives the bar a soft cookie/brownie like texture.  Airy in a way. I don't doubt that there are antioxidants are in here--but some super-special form of chocolate?  Shrugging.  I'm unconvinced it really matters much.  Regardless, they are tasty.<br /><br />The orange flavor was very pronounced, as was the chocolate--they blended well and neither overwhelmed.  The cranberry flavor was undetectable by me.  I liked them and I would buy them for my kids to eat as a snack if they didn't have milk in them.  One of my kids is allergic to milk, so that unnecessary ingredient (IMHO) creates problems in the snackfood arena for us.  If you don't have that issue, they may be suitable for your family.

Overall I'd buy them again because I did truly like the way they tasted. They were filling and perfect for a quick snack. I wouldn't use them as a meal replacement as there is only 4g of protein, but they work well as a satisfying between meal item. Although there are 6 gr of fat per bar, only 1 gr of that is saturated. We have to watch saturated fat at my house so that is a big thumbs up from me.<br /><br />Although cocoa is one of the ingredients, the bar itself doesn't really taste of cocoa. Orange was the predominant flavor overall.

review/summary: High in calories but also in flavor!
review/text: These Orange Cranberry bars are, first of all, delicious.  They have a cake-like texture that is very pleasant and the flavor is just the right mix of fruit and chocolate, not too sweet and not bitter or bland.  They're good enough that you may be tempted to eat several at a sitting, but don't do it!  They're also relatively high in calories, so you'll want to save them for times when you need to fuel up, such as after a run or workout.  In that case, I think they're ideal: they're filling, delicious, and transport relatively well.  They do crumble if you put any weight on them or stress the bar, but you can still eat the crumbles out of the package.  My husband was slightly put off by the look of the bar, since it looks very dense and brown, but as soon as he tasted one he was a fan.<br /><br />Over all, I'd rate these very high for the specific post-workout situation, but only three or four stars as a regular snack.

review/text: You can't really taste the fruit, and the texture of the bar leaves something to be desired. It's just too dry, is the problem.<br /><br />The chocolate is nice, through, and the size is just about perfect. Also, they really do function well as a nutrition bar and are quite filling. I'm a big guy and I was able to eat one of these in place of lunch and easily made it to dinner.

review/summary: an a - 1 snack!
review/text: this bar is delicious and filling.<br /><br />the best thing about it is the subtle mix of chocolate with the tang of orange and cranberry. it is also moist and very chewy to boot. there is also the presence of some oat and nut pieces just to remind you that you are chewing on something good for you.<br /><br />since receiving them, i have been snacking on them between meals or right before a four-hour rehearsal. after eating one, i feel full and my energy is well-sustained for the entire rehearsal.<br /><br />this will be on my list of purchases for my summer trip to teach at arts camp!

review/summary: dry taste
review/text: Like some of the other reviewers, I like to eat nutrition bars for breakfast, or as a quick snack.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these bars taste pretty bad to me. And the nutrition value doesn't make up for the poor taste.<br /><br />They have only 4g of protein and a lot of sugar, so they don't make for a very filling breakfast. Also they are very dry, need to have a drink when you eat them, so that makes a poor choice for a on-the-go snack too.<br /><br />I thought it was OK as pre-workout, perhaps because of the sugar giving me a little energy boost... but still, I'd rather just eat a cookie if I want a sugar spike.<br /><br />Also, the Orange Cranberry flavor has no noticeable cranberries or cranberry taste. Though it does have a strong orange flavor, it tastes like orange extract, a little bitter and tangy.

review/summary: Mild flavor, nothing special
review/text: This bar is not sweet enough to be a candy bar, it doesn't have enough protein to be a fitness (pre- or post-recovery) bar, its not a super carb-rich energy bar, I can't really figure out what it is supposed to be. Not sure why they call this a nutrition bar, not particularly nutritious. This is part of a line of items supposedly made with a proprietary blend of cocoa (kind of gimicky), but the flavor was super mild. I kind of liked the somewhat dry and crumbly, not too heavy texture, but the bar also fell short on taste. Mildly sweet, little cocoa or any other flavor. 200 calories is a lot for a bar that is light on flavor or purpose. The bar is on the small side for that many calories. I would rather get 200 calories elsewhere. On the upside, this bar has a lot less sugar than many others, but at 12 grams, that still amounts to 3 teaspoons of sugar, with little payoff. Save your money and try another bar (Lara, Luna, Balance, thinkthin, Atkins...) a million choices out there, all better than this one. Then again, if you like a lightly sweet, lightly chocolatey flavor (LIGHTLY), and a crumbly texture, then you may like this bar.

review/summary: Nice taste, but a bit crumbly...
review/text: I've tried a number of "nutrition bars" over the years.  There are certain characteristics that make them acceptable and desirable:<br /><br />1.  Taste - they have to taste halfway decent.  I realize these bars in general aren't supposed to be candy bars, but in the heat of competition or need, a bit of taste isn't bad.<br /><br />2.  Calories - one of the reasons for having a bar is to supplement your diet.  For example, I ran 10 miles this morning, costing me about 1000 calories.  Most bars are in the 200-300 calorie range.<br /><br />3.  Fat - I'd like the calories from fat to be less than 30%.<br /><br />4.  Ingredients - when push comes to shove, organic, whole grains, and few additives is my goal.<br /><br />5.  Fiber - at least 6 grams of fiber per serving helps the world go round.<br /><br />6.  High fructose corn syrup - avoid, avoid, avoid.<br /><br />7.  Consistency - they shouldn't fall apart as you are eating them.<br /><br />So this particular bar, Eat. Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bar (Orange Cranberry) has a nice taste (and some orange peel and cranberries in the ingredients!), is 200 calories with 50 calories from fat, has 7 grams of fiber, is a bit crumbly (don't eat it on a treadmill), and is mostly whole wheat, corn, and oats (nice).  It's not vegan.<br /><br />In general, I liked it.  Better than some, but I'm not giving up my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7RDRO">Clif Bars</a>.  Clif bars are less crumbly and made of USDA organic ingredients.  However, Eat. Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bars are not a bad option when Clif bars aren't around.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: The first thing I thought when i bit into this bar was "WOW!" The orange flavor is intense but not overwhelming. It's crumbly and sweet and delicious. The flavor and texture are perfection.<br />It only has 4g of protein, so it's not exactly going to keep you full the way a normal protein bar would, and it has a whopping 200 calories, so it's certainly not a light snack. However, with 7g of fiber and lots of other healthy ingredients, you could certainly do a lot worse. Chose this over a candy bar, you won't regret it.

review/text: The ingredient list is: salmon. No preservatives, no by-products, no grains or other fillers, no dyes. They smell like you would expect dried salmon to smell...not horrendous, but definitely like fish.  These are hard treats, but I break them into multiple pieces and they last a long time.  I like to give treats that vary from the typical beef and chicken that my dogs already eat. My dogs both love these treats - they are in the "high-value" category to them.

review/summary: Best tasting 100% whole wheat pasta we've tried
review/text: We try to eat only whole grains and so have tried a lot of whole wheat pastas.  We used to eat Arrowhead Mills 100% whole wheat spaghetti and it was okay, not anything we'd eat a whole 12 inch plate of.  Then our local grocery store started carrying Full Circle 100% whole wheat Capellini and we thought that was the cat's meow.  Then we tried the Gia Russa 100% whole wheat angel hair and were hooked.  It is the best 100% whole wheat pasta we've tried.  I will say that it appears that when talking about 100% whole wheat pasta that the thinner the pasta the better tasting.  So maybe that's all it is with this product, that of the 100% whole wheat pastas we've tried (including other shapes like penne, rotini, jumbo shells, and so forth) that this was the best because it was the thinnest.  In any case, we can eat a whole 12 inch plate of it plain and in my husband's case he'll even have seconds, that's how good it is.

review/summary: flowers came out white instead of pink.
review/text: I bought this serissa a few months ago from Bonsai Boy.  The bonsai arrived promptly and packaged well. When I first got it, there was no flower on the tree. While I was busy for a few days and didn't have time to water it, the bonsai dried out . So after a few months of carefully watering and keeping an eye on it, it now has come back to life. I am just starting to see flowers popping out this week, and to my disappointment, the flowers are all white. I have seen eight year old pink serissa from my local grower, it is about two times the size as this one if not more. Back then they advertise the tree as eight years old, I have several double white serissa, several single white, and several pink serissa, while I understand that Serissa is a very slow growing plant, this bonsai definitely is not eight years old. From time to times, a white serissa will change color from white to pink as some of mine does, but looking at the shape of the flowers, I doubt that color change will likely to happen. Another problem with this plant is that when I receive bonsai of this size, I usually take it out of the bonsai pot and repotting it into my own miniature garden, I usually see dense root formation, the root was quite shallow and underdeveloped on this plant, which I'm guessing the tree is not that old. Considering the hassle to order online without getting the right product, and that I found wayyyyyyy cheaper ones in comparable size in my local bonsai shop,  I won't be buying plants online again.

review/summary: Cocoa taste
review/text: This is one of the best milk chocolates there is and the most healthiest I've seen because is is 34% cocoa, one of the few milk chocolates that tell you how much cocoa it has. It is not as sweet as a typical Hershey bar or similar chocolate, but has a much fuller flavor. It doesn't taste like sugar, it taste like cocoa. It is not bitter like the 60 or 70% dark chocolate bars. I like Cadbury and several other basic milk chocolates but they are no match for this product, which is also organic. This is not only a healthier choice but it is an excellent chocolate with a rich cocoa flavor that lasts even after its gone down. I get it on sale for $2.50 a bar in grocery stores but not everyone carries it.

review/summary: One of the best bar Chocolates I ever tasted
review/text: Now everyone loves chocolate, it wakes up all your senses, and that feels good... With so many brands and combination of ingredients the possibilities are limitless.  Manufacturers aim for uniqueness, adding insane ingredients to the bar (We are discussing bar chocolate).. Now there are classes of bar chocolate, lets break this down.<br />For the masses we have chocolate like Hersheys, Cadbury, Nestle, Milka, Ritter Sport, so on... This class is all about mass production, putting together the ingredients from large silos into huge containers, no passion just some chemist mixing together some ingredients, being persistent in the taste and no room for improvement. They only improve their product by adding toffee, or fruits, nuts etc... YES these Chocolates are sweet (we love that), have cocoa (we love that), but it stops there.. I would call that "kids chocolate", cheap available every 10 feet and adds sweetness to your life, a quick fix.  I think you can get the same satisfaction by pouring sugar an cocoa down your throat..<br />The Artisan Chocolate like "Green & Black will expand your pallet, graduate you to a different world. Ingredients are simple, made in batches by hand, no assembly line here!! What make this chocolate so different is that they use less known cocoa called "Trinitario cocoa" (This Cocoa was used by the ancient Mayan and Aztec cultures in what is now southern Mexico. The beans were consumed as a strong, bitter beverage and praised as the "food of the gods." Two typical beans types  got crossed by accident to produce Trinitario beans..  Results? AMAZING!!! Incredibly deep cocoa taste that is different then dark chocolate. Green & Black is the only manufacturer to utilize this beans on a mass scale.. You get 34% from this bar (compare Hersheys milk chocolate 10% ). So what does it taste like?  Cocoa presence is intense, not overpowering, and it tastes like milk chocolate without the bitterness and hardness of dark. Texture is hard to describe, but it is unique, and adds to the experience...  One square and you will never call the other guys Chocolate makers".  One square goes a long way, and you will be satisfied after few of them, instead of eating a pound of the other guys. There are other pluses.. made in Italy, all organic ingredients good price (especially on Amazon)<br />Enjoy!!<br /><br />My chocolate bar rating site is coming soon for comparison of all chocolates of the world, with links where you can buy them in USA<br />[...]

review/text: My wife admits to being a chocoholic and one of my tasks is to keep her away from it rather than be an enabler. Well, it's now the holiday season and there's all these gifts and good food and what not. So, we were in our local "Fresh and Easy" grocery store with all their nice little displays of gourmet foods and there was a small shelf of chocolate bars. She picked up a couple, and what could I say? One was a 3.5 ounce bar of Green & Black's Organic Milk Chocolate. We sampled (read: ate) it this evening after the meal. My wife was in almost in shock. She proclaimed that this was one of the best milk chocolates that she's ever had. It was simply outstanding!<br /><br />Well, I'm not a chocolate aficionado and, in fact, try to stay away from it because I can't control my consumption very well. I'd agree that this bar was outstanding! It was cocoa rich with a slight bitterness and tasted more like what I would call a dark chocolate. It was much less sweet than the typical milk chocolate and quite delicious. Evidently, a lot of care is taken in the manufacture and all the ingredients are organic. Well, the care shows. I can't remember a better chocolate bar.<br /><br />Try it if you ever get the chance. Be ready to get out the stored Thighmaster and exercise bike.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I tried this chocolate after I saw it on the Martha Stewart Show. I usually expect "Milk chocolates" to be sweeter, which is not the case with this chocolate. People who would like to get a taste of the best milk chocolate on earth should try "Milka". I can highly recommend it.

review/summary: Good jerky, too much pepper!!
review/text: The jerky itself is very good quality. The only problem is how much pepper they load onto these pieces. It's so much that it burns my mouth and I can't even taste the jerky, all I can taste is strong pepper. Then it gets into the back of my throat and burns sometimes, or might get stuck in my teeth, all making for a very unpleasant experience!

review/summary: Never again
review/text: I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.  Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away.

review/summary: Edible..
review/text: The price was very good, but I guess I know why.  I gave it 1 star because it's low in carbs and another because it's edible.  There is a distinct foul odor when you open the bag for the first time.  After airing the bag out, the first piece I tasted was like chewing shoe leather, dry and chewy without much flavor.  After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.

review/summary: Horrible at WSOP
review/text: So I have been hanging with a top player at the world series of poker and I purchased 2 packages of Jacks Links beef jerky.  These 2 purchases were the worst possible way to spend my money.  The meat was so dry I was not sure if I was eating dried rat tail or beef jerkey.  The "meat" caused sickness and lock jaw.  Jacks links is as good as scraps off leather shoes.  It was pretty incredible of them to sponser the WSOP but provide poor quality food at a ridiculous price.

review/summary: Great snack....even during battle!!
review/text: I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!

review/text: I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you.

review/summary: Cheaper at Walmart
review/text: Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free.

review/text: I bought this flavor for the first time at the store, when they were out of my favorite (Sweet N Hot). My kids (ages 4 and 2) were begging me for some when we got back to the car. I told them they could try it, but that it would be spicy. They agreed, took the small bites I gave them and continued to ask for more until the entire package was gone! The flavor is exactly as the title describes. It's sweet and spicy, and reminds me of a dish I would order at a Thai restaurant. It's not as Spicy as the Sweet N Hot, but it still has quite a kick. It's not my favorite flavor, but I still give it 5 stars for the great texture and good flavor (and the fact that my kids devoured it). I bought this package with my kids in mind. I am all for natural products that they enjoy!

There were tiny bits and they were extra hard and grisly. I thought maybe it was just a bad run and let the next order come through. They were terrible also. It was like there was one or two decent strips of meat, and the rest was inedible. I'm not sure how this keeps happening. I had meant to cancel this subscription but remembered after I was shipped another pack of two. Maybe they'll be better but I haven't been eager to to open them. Roll of the dice, I guess.

So when I found this product on subscription on Amazon, I was more than thrilled to subscribe. That was two months ago. I've now cancelled my subscription. Why you ask? The unopened packages of the beef jerky were hard as a rock and were tasteless as a result. I don't know what Amazon does to receive the jerkys so cheap thereby giving the customers the 15% discount, but I'd rather pay more and get them off retail and enjoy every piece.. I am very disappointed at the result and won't re-subscribe again.

review/summary: Best ever
review/text: I buy a lot of stuff online and only write a review if something was very good or very bad.<br /><br />I honestly have to say that Jack Link's Jerky is the best jerky I have ever eaten (I've even bought some from a meat market before).  I have tried several of their flavors and all have been good.  The Sweet & Hot could be a little hotter, IMO, but it is still awesome and my favorite of theirs.  Besides the different flavors being good, what really sets Jack Link's apart from every other jerky I've tried is the quality of the meat itself.  The meat has the perfect amount of moisture, making it able to actually bite a piece in half without having to gnaw on it for 20 minutes.  While other brands aren't very consistent, particularly Pemmican, which I used to think was the best available, Jack Link's is very consistent with the quality of each piece.  Most brands usually have a mix of perfect pieces, dry pieces, and way too thick pieces.  Not Jack Link's, I've yet to get a dry piece, or one that was way too thick.<br /><br />The several people that I have "turned on to" Jack Link's would fully agree with me about this review.  We've actually spoke about how amazed we are with it.<br /><br />Walmart is the place that I first found it, and they are always out of stock of it.  So I turned to Amazon and was able to find it for roughly the same price when you factor in shipping.<br /><br />BTW, the package of ten 1.5 ounce bags is nice if you are like me and tend to just keep eating until it is gone.  :)  Also, each 1.5 ounce bag has about 25 grams of protein.  So if you are on a workout program, it makes a nice way to get extra 25 grams of protein with very little fat into your diet.

review/text: I love beef jerky, its perfect for work, packs tons of protein, easy to eat and store.  I have to say though the price of the stuff locally is insane, the 3oz bags go for up to 7 bucks a piece.<br /><br />This is the best deal I've found by far, select delivery 1 time a month for 16 bucks and sit back and wait for your jerky!<br /><br />Now on to the flavor, I usually buy the peppered Jack Links for the touch of spice.  Recently I found the A1 steak jerky, and its fantastic!  It seems like its more dry, like the homemade jerky I remember from my grandparents.  I find the most of the flavors to be to moist, and salty.<br /><br />If your a fan of jerky, and the taste of A1 sauce, you will enjoy this product, use amazons subscription option and save another 15%, excellent deal when compared to store purchasing.

review/summary: Tastes of Death (Peppered)
review/text: I got the peppered flavor and it tastes awful.  It's spicy as heck but the pepper taste is so overwhelming that it totally ruins it.  I got through about half a bag and not more then 2 pieces at a time.  Totally disgusting.  I like beef jerky and Jack Link's especially, just not this flavor.<br /><br />Anyone who is a health nut may not like this because it's loaded with MSG, though I think most beef jerky is.

review/summary: Is it meat?
review/text: I have been trying to find a good brand of jerky that I don't have to order online.  I finally tried Jack Link's original.  Way too sweet, doesn't taste like meat, and most of the pieces don't have the texture of meat.  At times, I thought I was eating plastic.  Or some soy meat-substitute.  I couldn't even make it through the whole bag.  I miss the original Pemmican..., before ConAgra sold the brand and it got ruined...

review/summary: Only Three Bags Came
review/text: I ordered the Original Beef Jerky, 3.25-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4) and I got it today. But after I opened the box I noticed that there are only 3 bags in the pack, and the pack is opened already. Very disappointed with this order! I have shopped through Amazon for many years, and this is the first time that appeared a problem.

review/summary: WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!  AND BEEF JERKY IS VERY OLD.
review/text: We buy a lot of Beef Jerky and usually Jack Links.  But, I have to say that Amazon charges a LOT more than grocery stores.  You can get this same bag at the store for $8.00 and it is very fresh there, not anymore on Amazon.  Disappointed.  Wont be buying any more here.

review/summary: Bag too big - gets stale!
review/text: Maybe they dont put enough of the "white" products savers in the bag.  The jerky was stale and hard in both bags.  Go with the smaller bags for basically the same cost when you add up the total ounces.  Wont be getting the bigger back again from Amazon!

review/summary: Most of Jerky is dry and not fresh
review/text: Purchased this jerky with S&S discount after reading some good reviews and was very disapointed with the quality of meat.  About 80% of the pieces were very dry and hard - note that some of the package was good (primarily in the middle of the package) and some of it was too dry.

review/summary: Spoiled long before "Best By" date
review/text: One of the most disgusting experiences of my life!  Pulled the package out, opened it without looking at it, and smelled something indescribably gross.  Looked through package window, and what was left of my jerky could not even be identified as jerky.  It was white yet covered with mold.  Couldn't see any evidence of a hole in the packaging.  It came in a 2-pack, and the 2nd pack looks fine but has the same date stamp on it, so I'm not sure I dare eat it.  They expire in December of 2013...14 months away.  I'm not sure what happened to it, just that I wasted $10, and I'm still nauseous just thinking about the sight and smell of it.  Is jerky even supposed to spoil at all?

review/text: You can count on Jack Links to provide a tasty, consistent-quality product. This Mega Pack is a great value, too. Still, I try to purchase smaller, boutique brands whenever possible. But they are becoming increasingly difficult to find. So Jack Links can definitely fill the bill.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/text: Wow!  I ordered this on friday night and received on tuesday afternoon.  That's pretty fast considering I am in El Salvador and my address is an APO.  They must have  shipped just in time for the outgoing flight from Miami to El Salvador.<br /><br />Of course the beef jerky is delicious.  I don't understand why there are beef jerkies in this damn country.

review/summary: Perfect Protein
review/text: I am on a high protein, low calorie diet.  Jerky is perfect because it has 15gm of protein per serving and only 80 calories.  It is immensely portable and doesn't have to be refrigerated, so I take it with me everywhere.  It is a lifesaver.  I have it on subscribe n save so I always have it available at a price much more reasonable than at the grocery stores. And I love the taste!

review/summary: Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy
review/text: I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links.

review/summary: Pretty Damn Good Jerky
review/text: I've been trying different jerkys because my Dukan Diet allows it... Some have way too much sugar content. Thanks, Jack Links, for doing it up right! (3 grams sugar compared to 7+ in other brands.) The peppered flavor is spicy enough to let me know I ate something, but it's not so sweet it comes across like candy. I buy pound bags and divide it into five baggies, or I'd eat the whole bag at once. The meat is pretty clean, compared to other jerky I've had where every other mouthful is unfit for chewing. Best price I've found was through eBay buying in quantity, then dividing the bags myself. That last crumbly handful left in the bottom of the one pound bag is a real eye-opener, as that seems to be where all the pepper seeds congregate. Good Times! P.S. Lost 40 pounds on Dukan Diet in about three months and am very content with the foods I get to eat, jerky being one of them.

review/summary: Very Convenient
review/text: Love Jack Links, so I was thrilled to see these easy to grab individually wrapped packages on Amazon with the Subscribe and Save option.  I have a son in college so I have them sent to him. It is pricier than going to a warehouse store and buying in bulk but you are paying for the convenience of the 100 calorie packs.  I have them in my pantry at home also, and my 2 adult daughters use them for their lunches also. I would have given 5 stars if the price was a bit lower.

review/summary: The Best of Jack Links brands in the 'hot factor category'
review/text: The Peppered brand is my favorite of the 'hot' options from Jack Links beef jerky.  It is on the pricey side, but I subscribe to it anyways currently.  I've tried the Jalepeno brand but, it is not as 'hot' as the Peppered brand -but I still make room for both.<br /><br />Again back to the price... it's on the high side.  Which compels me to eventually research more about making my own beef jerky and then make it closer to what I'm looking for - scorching hot!  Something that includes cayenne, habaneros and the like for a taste to remember!
