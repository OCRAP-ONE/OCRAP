review/summary: Black rice vinegar has too much of separate flavors, Didn't feel good swallowing it.
review/text: I am a big fan of Drinking vinegar and how versatile they are.<br /><br />I drink Hong Cho(Pulmuwon brand), mostly, and it was good for drinking, diluted in cold water, or served hot, but also it was fantastic salad dressing to my surprise. Hong cho tastes more like a fruit juice, and everyone who tastes it said they would drink it every day.<br /><br />(flavor)<br />However, this sempio(Sempyo, a popular Korean Soy Sauce maker)brand vinegar is below average in taste, and the sweet honey after taste didn't go well with the typical vinegar smell at the beginning. It is hard to describe, but some fermented or cough syrup-like not-so-delightful flavor, that is. Sip vinegar, sip some juice, and sip honey water, and you get sick. That was the experience from it.<br /><br />(packaging issue)<br />This Black Rice Vinegar comes in half the size bottles,in 4 bottles, probably equivalent to 2 bottles of Hong Cho . They arrive in a box, air-tight, in a clear document seal wrap, but it was not too securely packed with other items I ordered through amazon.com, when they were put together. SO, if UPS roughly handled it, any object inside the box would puncture the wrap easily inside the box. They will need some bubble wrap to fill the gap.<br /><br />Not, having too many options of drinking vinegar, I would encourage other users and put some more positive reviews for the benefit of accessible drinking vinegars in US market- I would keep this as my back up option. But, candidly speaking, I would stick to Hong Cho, if they are available on amazon.com again sometime soon.

review/summary: Vanilla flavor outshines the weak coffee flavor
review/text: I'm not someone who needs incredibly strong coffee, but after we received a Keurig as a wedding gift, Green Mountain Hazelnut and French Vanilla were the first two  packs of K-cups we bought.  We were disappinted with both.  The flavoring is good, but the coffee itself is weak, even with the coffeemaker set lower.  Recommend you buy Coffee People Jet Fuel and some flavored creamer instead.

review/text: I've heard others who don't like Keurig coffee but I really find it to be some of my favorite and with these cups quite easy to make and quick too. All the flavors are subjective and for me I haven't found any I don't like. I'm the type of coffee drinker who likes coffee shop coffee and not really fond of Star B. if that helps. So if your taste is similar you should like this too.

review/text: I love this coffee more than any other I've ever tried.  It's simply perfect.<br /><br />I do find it odd that the 48 count is over twice the cost of the 24 count but that's nothing major.  I just think it's weird and only people who are worse at math than me would buy the 48 count instead of the 24 count.  (There can't be many people worse at math than me...  I'm pretty bad.)<br /><br />Fantastic coffee though. I highly recommend it if you want a light, pleasant coffee.

review/summary: Green Mountain Coffee French "Chemical" Flavor
review/text: Having tried other instant Coffee/K-cups I'd have to say so far this is the worst attempt at French Vanilla that I have encountered. From the other reviews you either like it or dislike it and those that dislike it all have one thing in common, the "Overwhelmingly" artificial chemical taste. It's more like 90% Chemical, 10% Vanilla flavor and it does not taste better after a few weeks of drinking it.<br /><br />While not a k-cup, one of the better instant Vanilla brews is Nescafe's Taster Choice Vanilla packets. You'll need 2 packets of the tasters choice for the best taste, but it's a lot better tasting than this Green mountain k-cup.

review/summary: best cat food-- human quality ingredients, holistic approach, my cat loves it!
review/text: Blue Buffalo Spa Select is great! Top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- in addition to the indoor cat formula there's a chicken version and a fish version. This food meets a very high standard. No yucky meat "by-products", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, plus a host of wholesome and varied ingredients and probiotics.<br /><br />On top of that, this is an incredibly palatable food. My cat LOVES it. In fact, she scarfs it right down, when she typically has just grazed on a piece or two at a time of other premium foods. I have to be careful to use a measuring cup and not overfeed her, 'cause she will seek me out and meow for more!<br /><br />Blue Buffalo uses a unique process to manufacture "lifebits" which are added to the food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into cat or dog food.<br /><br />I came across this cat food at the local Tractor Supply. I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's a summary of the nutritional information:<br /><br />-Recommended daily feeding chart-- amount varies based on age, activity level, breed, and environement, but in general a 5-9 pound cat will eat 1/4-1/2 cup, while a 10-14 pound cat will eat 1/2-1 cup.<br />-One cup contains 478 calories<br />-Major ingredients:<br />Deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground barley, fish meal, oatmeal, whole ground brown rice, whole potatoes, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, dried egg, dried cellulose, whole sweet potatoes, whole carrots, cranberries, blueberries, flaxseed (natural soource of Omega 6 fatty acids), barley grass, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, kelp meal, taurine, l-carnitine, l-lysine, ycca schidigera, green tea extract, turmeric, salmon oil (natural source of Omega 3 fatty acids), black malted barley, dried chicory root, fructooligosaccarides, oil of rosemary, the expected vitamins and minerals, and several probiotics (lactobacillus acidolphilus, bacillus subtilis, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bifidobacgterium longum, enterococcus faecium).<br /><br />I hope this helps you evaluate whether or not this food is a good match for your feline friend.  My cat and I have been really happy with it.

review/summary: Thin and short
review/text: I've bought two other swizzles that were of the same length previously at local pet stores (one purchased after I placed this order, but it was too late to cancel this order), and it was both over a dollar cheaper and at LEAST twice as large (I used a tape measure and this product is around 1/2-5/8 inch by 2/8-3/8 inch thick where the store bought is around 3/4-7/8 inch by 1/4-1/2 inch thick...basically, the store bought was around twice the weight for a dollar less).  The others I've bought have also said they are without additives which I didn't see with this product.  The only reason I didn't give this a one star is that my older dogs did like these, where they shunned the much thicker ones I have bought previously (they did have the thinner ones at the store, but I don't remember their price).  Overall, I would avoid this product...overpriced by around 3-4 times.  Since the description doesn't state it, these are made in Brazil if you are interested.

review/summary: Really good and easy to make gravy.
review/text: My mother was english and this is really the only gravy my family has loved, in fact, they call it Grandma's gravy.  It is so easy to make a pot roast and the gravy at the same time.  I season and flour the roast, then brown it, drain out any oil, mix a couple of tablespoons of bisto with water, pour it over the roast, add vegs or an onion, cook it a few hours at 350 with foil over it.  The gravy thickens while the roast cooks.  I don't use anything else with beef or pork roasts.

review/summary: Addictive garlic but peeled is better to buy than this
review/text: Update 5/4:<br />Culinary Elite brand on Amazon is a better value now over this brand ...Culinary Elite is peeled so you get WAY more black garlic for the price aince there are no cores and peels in the bag.And all those cloves are good quality. I liked this one but it took forever to peel, got wasted by peeling off and sticking to the stems and the cores and peels weighed as much as the garlic so I got about half the garlic for the price by the time I was done when they were in containers side by side.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />Yep, black garlic is addictive.<br /><br />When you get good cloves you can pop a whole clove in your mouth and chew. On this brand, I did have some bad cloves in the bag but most were really good.<br /><br />It takes one month to make a bulb of black garlic...although it's called "fermentation" it's far from anything else you'd think of as fermented. It is kept at a very low oven temp with high humidity for 30 days, wrapped.  This causes the bitterness and pungency of the garlic to subside and concentrates the sugars and antioxidants so you wind up with what tastes like a caramelized garlic or slightly balsamic reduction taste.  It's amazing...<br /><br />spread it on anything, heavy...I love to chop it up in green beans, many put it on a steak at fine restaurants so it's often seen there ( I don't eat steak so I cannot comment on this use, but apparently it's becoming a "thing".)  Mashed potatoes are a work of art.<br /><br />Anything you might sprinkle garlic on just goes to a whole new level with this flavor.<br /><br />The texture is entirely different as well, no more hard cloves, they become almost gel-like.

review/summary: A Great Quality Product!
review/text: I purchased the black garlic to see if it would lower my cholesterol as touted by Dr. OZ. I've been taking it now for quite sometime and have to admit, its working. Granted, I'm doing other stuff like no fried foods and the like but my level has been lowered 20 points. I started to give this product a lower rating due to the fact you have to peel the garlic before use. It's a messy process but its one I chose and its not the sellers fault. Just the way it is. Next time I plan on ordering black garlic already cleaned. You folks with high cholesterol should give it a try, you just might be surprised. Oh by the way, if you try this garlic, remember what it is. Its garlic that's been fermented, so don't expect a flavor of ice cream and be sure to have something to wash it down. Pretty tough stuff. No wonder it works. Tastes like medicine.

review/summary: Perfection
review/text: Once you try Tamari why would you ever use soy sauce again. I first learned about San-J Tamari in 1987 while cooking at a vegetarian restaurant in Charlottesville Virginia. Much like soy sauce yet less salty with a richer and more subtle flavor. Fantastic for stir frying, as a condiment and as an ingredient in the preparation in sauces. Of all the brands I have sampled over the years none comes close to San-J Tamari. Simply the best.

However, it does not give me the jitters, the way some powerful black teas.<br /><br />After opening the box, you will have to take the tea bags and put them in an airtight container or bag.

review/summary: My Favorite DECAFFEINATED Tea
review/text: My favorite tea is Ahmad English Afternoon Tea when I can have a tea with caffeine, such as, in the morning through early afternoon; however, this is my favorite when I need to choose a decaffeinated tea, such as, late afternoon and evening tea drinking.<br /><br />Here's a tip to make your own "Do It Yourself" decaffeinated tea from regular tea.  Prepare your tea as usual and use a stop watch to time its steeping.  At precisely 30 seconds pour out the tea and re-brew the your tea for your normal steeping time (2 to 5 minutes), plus about 30 seconds.  During the first 30 seconds of steeping time about 80% of the caffeine in your regular tea is released, so only about 20% of the caffeine is left.  The resulting taste is about as good as regularly steeped tea.<br /><br />I haven't been able to find a statement of how much caffeine is left in this tea after steeping--my best guess is that about 95% of the caffeine has been removed in the decaffeinating process.<br /><br />Ahmad costs more than most teas, however, as the saying goes "there's nothing like a good cuppa."

review/text: These little coffee creamers are the perfect solution to always having cream for my coffee.  The convenience is wonderful and since I am on the automatic "resend" I don't have to remember to order.  Very impressive when neighbors come over for coffee, church socials, etc.  Living in NorthEastern Montana it's 40 miles to the closest grocery store and so it is very important to stay stocked up on items.  Not only is it convenient but the taste is perfect.  I love it!

review/summary: Great price on a good product...but no real inner protection for when shipped..
review/text: Needed some new creamers and happened upon this deal with the S&S savings.  I had read some of the reviews about the shipments arriving with some of the contents having some leakage, not been packed well, etc. - so was a bit worried as when you use Subscribe & Save it is usually shipped via USPS and can take up to 5 days for shipment.  And, you really just never know with your delivery with USPS vs. UPS.<br /><br />I ordered anyways because the price was a fairly good deal and kept positive that there wouldn't be a issue with the delivery, especially in the summer heat we've been having.<br /><br />Well, I received the order and yes, all the creamers were placed "openly" in a medium sized cardboard shipping box, sealed up (for the most part - you can still see inside the top of the box).  When I opened it I was ready for "anything" ~ I was surprised after looking at all the creamers individually not to find any blemished ones, none were "leaking" or "ruined" and they are all "useable".<br /><br />I can't give it a full 5 stars, because honestly I think with 180 creamers they shouldn't be placed openly in a cardboard box like they are being shipped.  I think, with a food product they should be more properly contained when shipped to the customer and it would make it safer during shipment from having any of the creamers prone to leakage, being ruined, etc.<br /><br />So four stars on this one Amazon, leaving one star for improvement on how this is being packaged.  Otherwise everything else with the product was fine!

It tasted fine before.  In fact now the Original Liquid tastes the same as every other cheap imitation out there.  I have found that the only way to get the original Original Liquid formula is in these single 0.375 oz packs.  I use them at home bring them with me when I travel. If Coffee-mate changes these single packs.  I will probably have to give up drinking coffee altogether.

I have had to throw many away and some are not easy to see why they are leaking.  For some reason the seal tops are on but not adequately and I go put into my coffee or tea and I get a clump of mucous like substance instead of creamer in my drink...another waste...that is not going to pass my lips.  I love the creamers, love the subscription program as I change flavors and mix and match...plus I don't have a refrigerator so please do note this review is for this one delivery only, all other times I have been happy, but they all came double boxed and in good condition and most enjoyable.  Amazon has never let me down before on my creamer purchases this time just a mishap...

If that is correct then these non dairy creamers were just packaged last week.

review/text: I've always used creamer singles in office lounge areas and gas stations, and I wished I could find the product for myself.  Now that I found this bulk pack to try I'm never going back to the old methods!  The half-and-half by the quart does not stay fresh, and the dried creamer does not taste as creamy.  These singles can be maintained warm or cold.  They are easy to open, pour in a cup, and toss into the trash.  The size is perfect for my 12-ounce coffee, or I can use a less for a smaller cup.  Thank you, Nestle, for making my daily life a little simpler.

review/summary: Convenient and Affordable!!
review/text: I checked Target, Walmart and our local Grocery Store, and buying the tiny creamers online was MUCH cheaper!!  We have them in a container next to our coffee maker, it makes us look like a B&B when our family comes out to visit. :)  Much easier than using powder or refrigerated creamers that can affect the temp of the coffee after adding it.

review/summary: Lactose-intolerant folks, BEWARE!
review/text: This is my second box of these creamers.  The first ones, ordered about 9 months ago, were great and did not cause me any gastrointestinal discomfort.  But after receiving this latest shipment a few weeks ago and after a couple days of having my morning coffee with two of these creamers, I noticed that I was having pronounced symptoms of having ingested dairy.  I guess it was my mistake in thinking that all Coffee-mate products were non-dairy.  I looked again at the label on these and it plainly says "Contains milk ingredients", so even though the product description says "lactose-free", it isn't.  I can't understand why the last box of these didn't bother me - maybe something changed with the formulation - but I won't be ordering these anymore.  I'm still giving the product 4 stars because it's a good creamer if you can tolerate dairy.  But if I could tolerate dairy I would've just bought creamers at the grocery store...

review/text: These sardines are very clean and mild tasting, not "fishy" or rancid tasting.<br /><br />They have a light, lemony flavor.<br /><br />The texture is very good, firm, yet not dried out, nor are they mushy.<br /><br />Sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and are extremely low in contaminants such as mercury.  They are also a good source of vitamin D, calcium, B12, and protein.<br /><br />As stated on their website, "BELA Sardines are sourced from traditional local fisheries along the non-industrial Portuguese coastline which have existed for centuries. BELA and these family businesses have forged strong relationships and friendships that lead to the freshest and best catches of the day becoming BELA Sardines"<br /><br />The olive oil is much better and healthier than cheap cottonseed oil.  I buy them in bulk.

review/text: This has been our favorite chili for years, and we've tried many.  We've even thrown away a partial case of another brand bought at a big box store.  We use it for chili dogs, in heated corn tortillas with cheese, or in a bowl with diced onions on top.  The only kind we like better is my homemade chili, which isn't always conveniently sitting on a shelf, waiting to be heated for a quick meal.  We always take a few cans when we go camping, and are never without Hormel Chili in our pantry.

review/text: This clam chowder is very creamy and tasty. One thing that some people may not like is the fact that unlike all of Campbell's other New England clam chowder's, the Soup at Hand clam chowder has NO chunks of anything what so ever. I am not exaggerating when I say that there is nothing much bigger than a grain of rice in this soup. At first I didn't like the texture of the chowder, but now I kind of like it because all the tiny bits in it makes the seem a bit thicker. If you like big chunks of potato and clams you will not find it here.<br /><br />I believe that the other reviewer that talked about the chunks of potato etc. probably has tried Campbell's other microwavable Clam chowder which does indeed have big chunks, but I don't think that reviewer has eaten the Soup at Hand version of the chowder.

review/summary: Very tasty, but awkward packaging
review/text: I love New England Clam Chowder and Campbell's Soup At Hand version of Clam Chowder is quite tasty and filling.<br /><br />What I liked: with 10 � ounces of soup, this is a great item to have for lunch, especially during a long cold winter.  It only takes a minute and 15 seconds to heat up, so it is a quick and convenient meal. The container is compact enough that you can keep several cans in your desk so you can just grab one when you're ready for lunch. Being able to heat up the container means one less bowl to clean and it's easy enough to rinse out and recycle the can when you are through with it. The soup is filled with potatoes, celery, and clams and is delicious. It's not too salty, which can be a problem with canned soup.<br /><br />What I didn't like: the container. Yes, I love its convenience, but it's too tall. The soup is meant to be sipped, not eaten with a spoon, but you still have to stir it and when you use a spoon to do it, almost the entire spoon goes into the can, which is very messy. Also, the plastic lid on the can is hard to take off and the opening to sip the soup needs to be wider, since items like the potatoes and clams sometimes get stuck and you need to take the lid off to finish the soup - and it's very hard to use a spoon to eat the remainder because of the shape of the can.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts: Each container has one service size that is 160 calories (calories from fat are 90). There are 10 g's total fat, 2 g's of saturated fat, and no trans fat. There are 5 mg's cholesterol and 890 mg's of sodium. Also, there are 13 g's total carbohydrates; 5 g's dietary fiber; 1g sugar; 4 g protein; 2% of the daily value of calcium; and 6% of the daily value of iron.<br /><br />Bottom-line: Campbell's Soup at Hand New England Clam Chowder is very tasty and filling but somewhat inconveniently packaged.

review/summary: Surprisingly delicious; virtually restaurant quality soup, and among the best ever store bought, But...
review/text: Wow. I was not expecting this to taste as good as it does. This is a wonderfully flavorful soup. You get real clam taste and a good texture (little on the thin side but acceptable), and even a bit of creaminess. It is actually the best tasting store bought clam chowder from a national brand I have ever tried. I have tried various types of Campbells before and Progresso, and probably some regional brands I can't remember.<br /><br />But this is a very good soup. The first few ingridients in order are water, clam stock, potatoes, celery, clams, vegetable oil. Unfortunately Campell's does use high fructose corn syrup, but it is at least fairly far down the ingridient list. Too bad to save a few pennies or less (maybe even a fraction of a cent over real sugar?) probably per can of production they choose that. It does contain monosodium glutamate in case that is a no go for some people.<br /><br />Overall though this is great to have in your pantry. You get a good amount of fill for 150 calories but you are also getting 15% of DRA for Total Fat 10 grams, and 10% of saturated fat, 2 grams. Zero trans fat is listed. It is good enough to have for lunch a couple of times a week. Pair this with some fruit, and maybe some cheese and you will have a good enjoyable work lunch. Nice to have on hand for rainy days also.<br /><br />It takes 1 minute 15 seconds on high. It is a narrow can but you do have the option of putting the 'sip cap' back on and drinking your soup. The advantage of that is that the can helps keep the soup warm all the way through. Enough good about this product starting with taste, that I do recommend it.

review/summary: Cheap and convenient but a bit bland
review/text: I've been buying these soups as a matter of cheap thrills and convenience. They are probably best used as a no-fuss and light lunch st work and school. Not all of the flavors are created equal, however. I rank the ones I've tried as follows:<br /><br />1. Tomato Parmesan<br />2. Cream of broccoli<br />3. New England clam chowder.<br /><br />The first two are very tasty. The third is a bit bland but still pretty decent.<br /><br />I can think of three advantages of going with this product:<br /><br />1. Cost. Bloom charges me $1.89 a can for this soup. Amazon's subscription plans often make the soup significantly less expensive.<br /><br />2. Ease of preparation. Just shake, microwave for 90 seconds, and you're ready to go. No other cooking utensils or preparation is required. The metal rims on the containers do not cause sparking. Pretty neat.<br /><br />3. Ease of consumption. Just sip from the container, which seems to be a foam material or plastic that doesn't conduct much heat and is easy to hold. It fits easily into car cup holders. No spoons or bowls are required.<br /><br />Anyone on a low-salt diet should think twice. The soups have 30+ percent of the RDA. The fat content is a bit elevated. These things are to maintain the flavor. Calories don't go above 220 or so.<br /><br />All in all, these soups have turned out to be an unexpected winner. I expect to be buying more.

review/summary: Delicious, quick and easy, but watch for swollen foil tops
review/text: I love this soup, it's the perfect pick-me-up on a rainy afternoon.  I shake the can, remove the foil top, heat for 30 seconds, then transfer to a ceramic or glass mug with the juice of half a lemon and heat another 60 seconds.. brightens up the flavor considerably.  Very tasty and satisfying.  Some reviewers mentioned it's not chunky, but it's meant to be an on-the-go snack, no utensils required.  I would not call it watery, by any means!  It's very rich and creamy with small bits of clams, potatoes, and celery that can be sipped right out of the container if desired.<br /><br />I have found on a few rare occasions (maybe 1 out of 25) the foil top is dome shaped, if you see this do not use!  I preferred the pull-top metal lids to the foil, much safer, but they all seem to be foil now.  Also check expiration dates.  Amazon's price is excellent, especially with a subscription, about $10 delivered for an 8-pack!<br /><br />If you are interested in nutritional information you can find it at [...]<br /><br />The New England Clam Chowder has 10 grams of fat, whereas the Classic Tomato only has 0.5 grams of fat and can be almost as satisfying.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the foil tops, and if you heat it in the container as directed, you should stop and stir it once or twice to keep it from overflowing.  (If it's hot on the bottom, but cold on top it will "spit" and jump around in the microwave.)<br /><br />Highly recommended, great snack!!

If you use one or two cans of this soup in a big bowl, it should be thicker and not so watered down.<br /><br />Add some salt, pepper, and tabasco, and you have an extremely tasty meal that takes a coupe of minutes to heat up. I don't heat up in the metal/plastic container. I pour everything into a microwave save bowl, then heat it up half way, then stir, then continue. (Total time is about 3-4 minutes on 1000 watt microwave)... I'm not kidding you. You add in the salt, pepper, and tabasco like they do in restaurants, and you can't tell the difference between this stuff, and the stuff they make on fisherman's wharfs. No joke.<br /><br />4/5 stars because it should be thicker. But what a deal!

The cheapest Campbell's clam chowder I could find was over $2.  Being out a couple of bucks isn't too bad but suppose it were more money.  Amazon evidently does not stand behind what they sell.
