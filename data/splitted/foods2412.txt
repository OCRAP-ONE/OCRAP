review/summary: Loose Poop
review/text: I liked that the ingredients list was full of healthy things and had no corn or fillers. My puppy liked the taste. However, I'm rating this a 2 because while on Wellness, he had the runs. His poop was always super wet and mushy and sometimes it would be all liquid. I've tried the Eukanuba Natural Wild Salmon puppy food and he likes that, it's also healthy without corn or fillers, and his poop is firm and normal.

review/text: My puppy absolutely loves this food.  He is a rescue and I wanted to give him something really healthy and to be honest all the dog food recalls in the past kind of scared me so I did my research and am pretty satisfied as is my dog.  It is on the bit pricer side of dog food but I think it's worth the excitement my dog gets over eating it!

She really didn't like the wellness product that much, and she had runny stools while eating it.

review/text: I've had a goldendoodle puppy for about two months (the dog is 4 months old).  The first 6 weeks after I used this product I had no problems.  The past two weeks, hoewever have been tough.  After ruling out a possible infection, I determined that the this product was causing diarrhea to my dog.  When reading the nutirent information, this kibble is very rich in protein and fat.  I think my dog is stating to change and the food is no longer agreeing with him.

review/summary: Works for my pup!
review/text: I have a Boston Terrier who has been on this product for quite some time. I tried a bunch of different foods before this, but they all had various problems--and she had a very sensitive stomach. This food works wonderfully for her and I've had no problems with loose stools.<br /><br />One thing to be sure of, if you're transitioning to this food, is to not do it suddenly--that may cause problems with the dog (including diarrhea). My vet advises slowly transitioning over to a new food, blending it in the old, and taking 1-2 weeks before the new food fully replaces the old. Completely changing the food can have a bad effect on some dogs with sensitive stomachs.

review/summary: Pug Puppy and Cat Hate Wellness
review/text: I recently purchased this puppy food at my local feed store. I usually buy another brand called Nature's Recipe: Chicken, Sweet Potato and Pumpkin which is grain free and my pug puppy seems to really like it. However, noone sells it locally and I have to drive an hour away to the bigger city to get it. After running out of my puppy's fave food and not wanting to make a long drive, I settled on this puppy food by Wellness. As soon as I poured it in her bowl, she took one sniff, backed away and then looked up at me with her funny little pug expressive face. To be honest, even though it is dry food, the appearance was very unappealing. I thought I'd give it a day because after all Wellness is not only a very expensive food, but is a highly rated brand. For that one day, her bowl remained untouched and my little puggie was constantly begging for our food during our meal times. Needless to say, I made the one hour drive to replenish her favorite food.<br /><br />I had the exact same experience with my cat as well. I ordered a huge bag of highly rated Wellness cat food some time ago and after reading all those reviews about how other people's cats just go crazy about the stuff I thought for sure my cat would like it. One day my cat walked to her bowl, looked up at me, back down at her food and hissed at it. I got the message. She hated Wellness. I'll never buy it again.

review/summary: Good Quality Food at a Reasonable Price
review/text: My puppies were on Nutri Source which is also a nice food but I wanted something I could get more easily. The first pup I transitioned over to Iams but he tired of it quickly. The positive reviews on Wellness prompted me to try it and I'm very glad I did. He gobbled it down, first bowl. The second pup had a bout of diarrhea, even with me mixing the old and new food together to get her used to it. I'm not sure if the food was the cause as my other dog also had the runs at the same time, but they're doing well now and enjoying their Wellness diet. I love that Amazon has this on prime delivery. I've also switched my cat over to Wellness but he never tells me anything so I'll assume it's acceptable for him.  :)

review/text: Previously, I fed my collie puppy with Purina Pro Plan, but after suggestions from friends who also own dogs, I decided to try out Wellness. The most distinct difference is that this food doesn't smell, the texture and the size is more suitable for a puppy to thoroughly chew before swallowing, and my dog likes it better than Purina. Also, the puppy's feces no longer smell and it makes much less of a chore to clean up her mess. It's been 2 months since the change, and my puppy is doing very well.

review/summary: Will Not Feed My Puppy Anything Else
review/text: After adopting our lab/boxer mix, Nero, we quickly found out that he was very particular about what he ate.  We tried everything, but still he wouldn't eat.  We went for a couple of weeks like this.  We started worrying and even took him to the shelter/vet and asked what we should do.  They only said, "don't worry, he will ear eventually."  We tried everything from Eukanuba, to Science diet, you name it we probably tried it.  We ended up with a cupboard full of bags that had less than a cup of food taken out of each.  He eventually started eating a little, I guess just enough to have something in his stomach, but not nearly the amount he should be eating.  It was pretty stressfull, as this was our first time actually owning a dog.  It got to the point where we'd walk him, and people would comment about how skinny he was.  Sad, I know.<br /><br />Finally someone recommended we try Wellness.  Now, I will say that we were a little hesitant at first, because it was a bit on the pricey side.  And we really didn't know that much about pet food.  We figured, you know, he's a dog, so long as he's not eating table scraps, it shouldn't matter that much (read: we were very ignorant).  Boy were we wrong, and since then, we've come a long way.  After checking out the Wellness site and really doing some research, we decided that it was worth it.  So we bought a little bag to, you know, try it out.  Just in case Nero didn't like it.  To our surprise, he loved the stuff!  Scarfed it down like I've never seen him do before.  My boyfriend and I both stood there silently while we watched him eat a whole bowl of food for the first time.<br /><br />Needless to say, after that we went online and bought a whole 30-pound bag.  I love that my dog loves this stuff, and I love that it's also good for him.  I mean, this stuff is human-grade.  HUMAN GRADE!<br /><br />People are also always commenting on how good our dog looks, how shiny his coat is.  It's definitely noticeable that he's eating well.  We saw his sibling who, sadly, is still in the shelter, and you can tell the difference between the two dogs, just by looking at their coat, and I know it's because of Wellness.<br /><br />And because of that, I will NEVER feed my dog anything else. Ever!

review/summary: Gave my English Bully Bloody Diarrhea!!!
review/text: I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands. After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made. My little bully's stool was never firm. It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day. I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy. The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life. Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food. I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case. I started the "at home remedy" of pepto bismol and a bland diet. The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well. BJ fasted for 24 hours. After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!! This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PET AND A FEW BUCKS SAVED FROM A VET VISIT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOOD!

review/text: This product was overall okay.  The ingredients are of good quality, and taste good.  There was also nothing wrong at all with the product itself.  The only real issue I had with this, was that I could find every ingredient at our local Wegman's (a somewhat fancy grocery store) for reasonable prices a few weeks later, when I thought about how I can restock when I run out.  When I did the rough calculations in my head, it added up to about the same to buy each item individually as it did to buy this kit.  It made sense too, because each product was wrapped individually and thrown in the shipping box, like it was put together that way.  So I feel like I didn't get the best deal when you add shipping and tax into the mix.

Thank you, and see you again next year.<br /><br />BTW, this is a "4 star out of 4" situation. I'm not taking a star off for anything--I just like to save the last star for very special occasions.

review/summary: Pink Sea Urchins
review/text: Very beautiful urchin shells but keep in mind that they are small.  The ones I received are about 2 inches in diameter so all 3 fit in one hand.  The plants were very healthy and fit nicely into the shells.  Also the plants are not glued into the shells so if you need to soak them they can be taken out and placed back into the shells.

review/summary: says made in china on it :(
review/text: I bought this lollipop to attach our business card at trade shows.  It is the perfect size, color and design are very nice.  However the plastic wrap says that its made by Oriental Trading Company with their information and it says made in china.....I want to represent my business to the best way and this will not portray that image.  I regret purchasing these but am considering repackaging them but that will take time and money for the plastic wrap.<br /><br />Follow up!  I went to Michaels and bought lollipop clear wraps and then closed the bag with a ribbon with our business card attached.  This worked perfectly (was a little more work) but now they look like gourmet lollipops and taste really good (just take away that made in China ugly wrapper and replace it!) I will buy again.

review/text: I did not like these lollipops.  They were MUCH smaller than I expected, and each pop has a "made in china" plastic wrapper on them.  Not great for a party, as most parents don't like to see MADE IN CHINA emblazoned on something they are going to feed their children, considering all of the issues with China and lead.  I'm not saying these have lead, but the packaging could have been a little more elegant.

Tastes really great, it has vegan sugar, no milk products whatsoever--it has a certified vegan seal.  I buy this blueberry flavor and the Deep Forest Mint flavor which you can get at a reduced price here on line.  Can't beat that!

review/summary: Yes You Can Use this in Baking Too
review/text: Over the years I've reviewed a number of sea salts but I keep coming back to this one for the superior flavor this salt gives to all my recipes. I use it just like regular salt but crush it in a mortar with a pestle. Some people are shocked by this, in fact they have left comments saying I should not use it this way.<br /><br />The truth is I've noticed quite a few chefs calling for this ingredient in their recipes - even when baking. I find that when I grind this salt it dissolves better and leaves a more uniform salty taste.<br /><br />Most people feel this salt is too expensive to use for anything else instead of just a finishing salt. I think it gives more flavor to everything I use it in or on. I first started using this particular salt in chocolate cake and then started using it in soups and sauces.<br /><br />Fleur de Sel is a  moist, caviar of salt that is hand raked from the surface of salt ponds on the coast of France during July and August.  This salt has a distinct salty-from-the-sea flavor that is unique to these salts. The flavor just fills your entire mouth. Normal table salt will pale in comparison and almost has a chemical aftertaste.<br /><br />You can also sprinkle this salt onto anything you want just before serving, especially good on steaks or freshly cooked vegetables. Also delicious with butter and rosemary on freshly baked bread.<br /><br />So, yes, I do recommend using this salt instead of regular salt in "all" your recipes. Once you try it I think you will be hooked on the gourmet flavor. This should be a verified purchase but I guess the seller I originally bought it from at amazon is no longer in business, at least not here.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

No image!  haha.  These chips are very crunchy & smooth, not rough like some other shrimp chips, which hurts the roof of your mouth.  I got mine at an Asian store for 3.99.  This is my fav brand.  35% of it is from real shrimp, 45% tapioca, some palm oil, salt & pepper that's all.  Not too salty, good shrimp flavor.  Fun snack to eat with fresh fruits.  It's difficult not to love these chips!  :)

review/summary: Beware - Soup explodes in microwave
review/text: Not a good soup for the microwave.  Something in the soup or in the container design causes the soup to explode (top flies off and soup everywhere) or causes the container to jump around like a Mexican jumping bean, many times landing on it's side and draining cold soup throughout the microwave. I have tried in different brands of microwave and experienced the same issues.  I place container on paper plate, and cover container with many sheets of paper towel.  Sometimes this contains the mess, but often the force of the explosion will throw paper towels to the side and the eruption coats the inside of the microwave.

Safeway often has the Microwave version on sale at a much lower price than Amazon but the regular price is much higher.

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZO2">Healthy Choice Chicken with Rice Soup, 14-Ounce Microwave Bowls (Pack of 12)</a> tastes like a chemical spill but the noodle version is excellent.

review/summary: Tasty and convenient
review/text: This soup is great -- very tasty, and only a tiny little bit bland (it's healthy, what do you expect?). There's a good amount of noodles and meat, and the portion size is pretty good. I would have made it larger, but it's satisfying enough -- as long as you don't expect two servings in a container. As I believe others have noted, it's just silly of them to say that a serving is one cup of soup.<br /><br />The package is recyclable (#5) plastic. There are 220 calories per bowl, and the price now on Amazon ($29.30 for 12 bowls) is $2.44 per bowl, which is better than my grocery store's price of $2.69. Amazon had a deal on this soup in February, and I'm wishing I had stocked up at the lower price.

review/summary: Broth is tasty but....
review/text: I was extremely disappointed in this soup.  There were, at most, six or seven noodles and maybe five or six hunks of chicken.  It was mostly broth.  I had to salt it a little but not much.  The broth really was very tasty but if I want to drink broth with less meat than a chicken wing, I will buy some Swanson's broth in a box.

review/summary: Not such a healthy choice -- exploded in microwave
review/text: I regularly heat soup in a microwave at my office.  Brands include Campbell's, Progresso, etc. in "microwavable" containers like this HC product.  Each requires a slightly different time to heat completely so the first time I heat a product I watch it carefully to determine that time.<br /><br />I followed the HC directions, removing the metal lid under the plastic cover and replacing the plastic cover.  Our microwave is a relatively low wattage model (compared to the 1700 watts assumed by HC on the label) so I knew it would take longer than the 1 minute 30 seconds they recommend.<br /><br />Because it was lunch hour, other people were waiting while the soup heated.  We were all startled when there was a loud bang from the microwave and the plastic cover blew off the top and the container jumped, splattering soup all over the inside of the oven.  It took about five minutes and a lot of paper towels and water to clean up the mess.<br /><br />The soup that remained tasted fine and the meat was more tender than normal for soup in microwavable containers.<br /><br />That said, I cannot recommend it nor will I buy it again.  I choose such soups for convenience, not excitement.<br /><br />I did report my experience to ConAgra (parent company of HC) but to date they have not responded.

review/summary: Not that great!
review/text: Quite frankly, we think this soup is disgusting.  There is no flavor to it whatsoever, and if I accidentally buy it, hoping a different flavor will be better, my husband (who eats ANYTHING!) just groans and chokes it down.  The only thing good about it is that it does have more "stuff" in it to fill you up, but just no taste.  After you dump about a pound of salt into them, they resemble something with some flavor, but not really.  It's healthy all right, but there are many other products out there that are just as healthy but have all the flavor as well.  If you don't like spices, then this is your soup.  However, since I make my own and we're more used to flavor, this one just doesn't cut the broth.

On the bright side, this product contains no M.S.G. and there is a mailing address in case you wish to contact the manufacturer for any reason.<br /><br />Overall, Lawry's makes excellent seasoned salt.

review/summary: Great for bland food
review/text: If you think about the diet consumed by most people through most of history, the food was probably, by our standards, very bland. There were no refrigerators and no fast food, and there wasn't much refined sugar around. So how did people eat this bland and sometimes even rotting food? They doused it in salt and seasonings. And once you start putting salt, like this seasoned salt, on your bland food, you get used to it. I've found that during my diet, I can keep to my goals as long as I have some Lowry's handy. For instance, tonight I had a dinner of peas, potatoes and a little cottage cheese. That doesn't sound very appetizing, but once it's covered in Lowry's seasoned salt, it's actually palatable. Of course, there are some who believe the best way to diet is to eat food with no seasonings and as little flavor as possible, or what is known as the low-palatability diet. While there is some truth to that idea, and though I've been successful at losing weight on that diet, I don't take the hard line position that no seasoning is permissible. In fact, I think a lot of seasoning on bland food is the way to go if you can't take an entirely bland diet. So, to wrap it all up, Lowry's is a great way to make bland food taste OK. If that's what you want.

review/summary: The Greatest Spice Mix Ever...
review/text: Lawry's seasoned salt is the greatest spice mix ever. When I was in Iraq, we would beg our families to include Lowry's in the care packages they sent us. Lowry's made MRE's bearable, and even improved the food in the chow hall. That may not seem like much, reading it on Amazon, but in Iraq, Lowry's was a lifesaver.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Makes all Army food bearable, so I'm pretty sure it has supernatural powers.<br /><br />* A little Lowry's goes a long way, so a 16 ounce container will give you plenty of use.<br /><br />* The container is made from sturdy plastic, and the lid screws on tightly. This is especially useful when you are carrying the container in your pack or pocket on a mission...I assume the same qualities would be good for hiking, camping or taking on picnics.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*None.

review/text: I ordered mine a couple weeks ago when the price was $30 lower.  These aren't very well processed.  There are a lot of black seeds in them.  But the worst thing is the bitter seeds, which I discovered when I bit into one the very first serving.  I can't enjoy these as a nutty, crunchy additive to foods.  The only way I can use these is to mix some in a drink and swallow without chewing.  It's going to take a long, long time to use up 5 pounds when I use 1.5 Tbs each morning.  So far no rocks, but crossing my fingers.<br /><br />I need better glasses I think...I wrote the above copy this morning.  Tonight I poured a Tbs of the chia seeds into the lid and inspected it under bright light.  What I thought were black chia seeds are in fact rocks...lots and lots of rocks.  There is further contamination with a much smaller, perfectly round black seed (pigweed?)  I have written to the seller to request a refund.  I shudder to think what other contaminants I have consumed in the two weeks since I bought this product.

review/summary: Yumm Yumm Yummy
review/text: I absolutely love these yummy, chocolately bars. I'm diabetic and they don't make my blood sugar soar, but are chewy and sweet without being sticky or sugary. They are a great snack to help when you get that afternoon low. Much healthier than a candy bar. I keep these on hand at work and had to put a lock on my locker because my coworkers couldn't keep their hands off them. Try them, you won't be sorry.
