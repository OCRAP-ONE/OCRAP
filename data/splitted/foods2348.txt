review/summary: Handy, and tastes great, excellent with crushed ice
review/text: I tried this, and liked it- now I am loving it!<br /><br />I have bought all the flavors, and prefer Fruit Punch, Strawberry, and Sweet Tea the most.  The flavor is not for the shy - a little goes a LONG way. In some ways, it IS similar to Crystal Light, which I have enjoyed for decades ( For those mature enough to remember, that product was launched with Linda Evans, at the time, Dynasty's "Krystal"... Crystal Light is also a KRAFT product).<br /><br />MiO is easier to use, and has better color, and is super-easy to transport- to the office, to the gym, where ever you might be. The fruit punch reminds me of a popsicle at a theme park ( in my case 60's and 70's!). Needless to say, a very positive memory!<br /><br />So far, I have used it in regular and sparkling water, and enjoyed it.  Have also used it with a SodaStream unit, with excellent results.  But the best is with crushed ice - much like a "Sno-Cone" -beyond GOOD!  Just put it in a personal, or regular size blender, add some ice, and 30 seconds later - a refreshing treat! PERFECT after a workout, a run, or just a long day.<br /><br />(okay, I admit, one could add a dash of vodka to that as well, for an evening event....yum!)

review/summary: My Preferred Choice
review/text: *I'm a BzzAgent, I received this product free to try out.<br />Okay, so I'm a college student who has spent most of her life in the countryside. I am definitely not used to city water. The water on campus is incredibly disgusting, vile even. I try to bring as much from home as I can, but I run out quickly or it goes bad. I'm not the kind of person who would buy water, so instead I have resorted to flavor enhancers.<br />Most I try aren't that great; just makes it taste like water with a slight hint of flavor which is sometimes sour. MiO, however, is definitely my new favorite.<br />I received MiO fruit punch. After trying it out, it never leaves my backpack so it's always there if I need it. It tastes great, is convenient to use, and closes tightly to prevent messes. Unlike most water flavor enhancers, this can fool you into thinking you're not even drinking water. It's great to use if you're trying to replace unhealthy drinks such as soda.<br /><br />PROS<br />~Small packaging so can be put into purses or backpacks easily.<br />~Cap locks well, haven't experienced any stains and spills when dropping it.<br />~Easy to use, it's just 1 squeeze per 8 oz of water (which is basically 2 for a bottle of water, which is what I normally use.)<br />~Tastes better than competitor products<br /><br />CONS<br />~If you manage to spill it will stain a bit.<br />~Seems like it would run out quickly or that it wouldn't live up to it's claim of 24 servings.

review/summary: Normal usage = 27 servings tested for me, and about the coloring
review/text: I posted a picture in the Peach Tea MiO product that says it all about servings:some of the reviews seem skeptical so I started keeping track with a mark after each use. My usage was 27 servings from one bottle. The fruit punch did as well as the peach tea for me, 27 servings.<br /><br />Some people have said these have too much food color in them but I realized why: the color is serving strength feedback. People expect fruit punch to be a certain color so they heavily color the MiO so that you'll get the color you expect at the dosage you should use. This is clearly purposeful product design.<br /><br />I drank this at my desk and during workouts to get some flavor without empty calories and it worked great.

review/summary: Delicious, well designed and a good value
review/text: I've only had the fruit punch flavor of Mio, but I'm very pleased with it. The flavor is great and you don't need much to do the trick. Just a quick squirt and your glass of water tastes excellent. And while some reviews knock the strong color I like it. It's a good way to measure how much you like in your water.<br />The packaging is also great. It's sturdy and closes tight. You could definitely travel with it without worry of it leaking in your bag/purse/pocket.<br />And for the number of uses you get out of each bottle and how flavorful it is, it's a great value. It tastes better than Crystal Light in my opinion, and you get more for your money.

review/summary: Refreshing
review/text: I tried this on a whim - not usually something I do.  I now have most of my work place drinking it.  Gives water a great flavor with out that sickly sweet taste and NO CALORIES!  Almost too good to be true.  I found the price a little steep in the store, but on Amazon, it's completely outrageous.  I was paying $3.49 at Walmart (close to $3.75 with tax).  The cheapest I've seen it on Amazon it close to $4.00 a piece and that's without shipping!  While it's true you get about 2 dozen servings (making it cheaper than soda and much better for you), I still think it's a little pricey.  And yes, there is nothing natural about it, but again much better than drinking Aspertame or any other artificial sweetner.

review/summary: An alternative to soda and KoolAid
review/text: My kids would go through sodas like crazy if I let them, but soft drinks are obviously unhealthy and getting quite pricey. But the kids are always looking for something different to drink other than water. Milk and juices are great for having with meals, but when they're looking for a quick drink of something else for other times, I wanted something that was easy enough for them to mix/make themselves without making a huge mess. MIO has been great for this. My daughter (11 years old) loves it. She has fun mixing it herself, and at the same time it's better for her than grabbing yet another soft drink. The size also makes keeping one of these in the car handy too. You can fill up a travel bottle with water and then add a few drops of this to it for flavor.<br /><br />The color and flavor is very concentrated, so be careful the first time you are making a drink with it. My daughter didn't realize how hard she was squeezing the bottle and it shot a whole stream out. She missed the glass entirely and got it on her clothing, which is now stained bright red. Test it out some the first time and get a feel for how man drops gives a glass of water the flavor strength you're looking for. Once you know the right amount, then each drink is just a few drops away!

review/summary: KoolAid for grownups
review/text: First, let me say I agree with other reviewers about the color and chemicals.  Every time I flip the top on this thing, I wonder how many days/weeks I'm shortening my life.  It essentially tastes like KoolAid and I loathe admitting this, but here goes ... I LOVE IT!  Being someone who mostly drinks water and green tea, it's hard for me to compare this with other sweet drinks.  Sometimes, when you're thirsty and only a sweet drink will do, this is there to fill the bill.  When it came out, I thought it was a pretty good buy - even at 5-6 bucks per container because of the number of drinks they promised in return (cant remember how many drinks they say -- I seem to remember 24) If you drank it like that, I'd imagine it would be pretty weak - like water with a hint of flavour.  I like mine stronger.  Think of this stuff as that fruity syrup they'd squirt over snow cones at the fair.<br /><br />I never review food products on Amazon - just books -- but I felt compelled to write here today because I wanted to see how much these would cost in bulk and Amazon usually has some pretty good deals.  Not so with this product.  $20 for 4??  That's $5 a pop!  Walmart (a place I NEVER shop) sells them $10 for 3.  Much better deal.

review/text: Don't bother buying this here, it is WAY overpriced.  Stop by Wal-Mart and pay a bit over half what these people are selling the stuff for.<br /><br />Anyway, we have now tried all the flavors.  Like any other flavor, some we like better than others as it is a matter of personal preference... but all of them were good.  We really like all but the Fruit Punch and will cycle through all the other remaining flavors again and again.<br /><br />Kraft Foods are not claiming they have invented a new major food group here, it is water flavoring.  They came through with that just fine.  Unscrew the cap, squirt into the bottle, replace the cap and shake.  Can't get any easier than that.  Using tap water is fine too.

review/summary: It's All About Portability
review/text: What makes these so great to me is the ease of use, the portability. You could throw one of these in your desk at work, in your glovebox of your vehicle, in your purse (though I'd put it in a ziplock baggie just to be safe), pretty much anywhere.<br /><br />This tastes a bit "kool-aid-y" for my taste so it's not my favorite. I sure wish they made a pink lemonade but this one is not bad. I do like that I can make it as strong or weak as I like and the flavor is so intense that I ran some ice through my blender and added a bit of this and it was very like having a slushy only without all the sugar/calories.<br /><br />I tried the fruit punch, the berry pom and the strawberry watermelon. All were good but as I said before, I'd rather have something that tastes more......adult I guess. I would buy these again to use to make the slushy drink. It costs less than they charge in town and I can't get those without all the sugar.<br /><br />My neighbor's children thought these were great as they could "mix and match" the flavors as they liked.<br /><br />Bottom line: I bought these at a store and they cost around the same as a box of crystal light so I thought that was reasonable. They are extremely easy to use and portable. I will probably buy again.

review/summary: Too sweet, with tiny portions!
review/text: I work in a very hot locality, at least when it's summertime.  My group and I get very thirsty.  We discussed this (argued, actually...) and decided to order some fruit punch so we'd have a break from drinking the water here (it has lots of minerals and tastes like poison).  We ordered five 4-packs of this fruit punch, there are four of us and figured it would last awhile.  But we were shocked when we opened the package.  The bottles are only 1.6 ounces - this is less than one twentieth of a liter, or one thousandth of a cubic foot!  The hole under the cap is very tiny, you can't drink from it or even fit a straw.  We cut them open with knives and tried to soothe our parched throats, but the mixture is so extremely sweet it only made us thirstier.  Plus the shape of the bottle is very hard to keep on the handlebars of your bicycle if it is in motion.  Please make the bottles bigger (maybe a liter or so) and put a hole for a lanyard so I can tie it to my bicycle or hang around my neck.  Bless you for your quick mailings!!!

review/summary: Delicious, but...
review/text: I've been a heavy water drinker for the past year. I burn through probably 10-15 bottles in any given day. I don't typically watch television, so I didn't know of this products existence until I was clued in by a friend of mine. I jumped straight to the 4-pack because it was much cheaper than paying $4 per bottle at the local grocery stores, and I figured if it was good, it'd be nice to have it with me. I received the product and was eager to taste it. I was pleasantly surprised by how little I had to use of the Fruit Punch flavor and how vibrant the taste was. One bottle lasted a whole week, even with my water consumption rate. The only downside is, now I seem to have to urinate three times more frequently than before using this product. I was literally in the middle of using the restroom, and it hit me again. Longest. Pee. Ever. Still delicious though, just an odd side-effect.

review/summary: Good taste & packaging but excessive food coloring
review/text: I'm not someone who believes food coloring is unhealthy - I don't think there's any scientific evidence to support that allegation.  HOWEVER, given that I can buy a powder with little or no coloring in it, which MIGHT be healthier, AND not worry about getting a stain on my clothing from a drop or two, I'm not buying this or Crystal Light - though I like the flavor of both.<br /><br />A woman at work had a bottle of this in her desk.  We had been talking about needing to drink more water and I told her that I buy Propel powder packets when they are on sale as I will drink more water when it is flavored.  She offered me this to try.  I was VERY disappointed when this concentrate came out with such intense color.<br /><br />I guess there have been some consumer/marketing studies that indicate colored concentrate is favored by a lot of people or the maker of this wouldn't spend the money to add the coloring.<br /><br />I'm glad I got to try it without buying it.  The one thing that attracted me to it was the packaging - I hate cutting open several packets a day of Propel powder and throwing them away.  I don't know why Propel isn't sold in a cannister with a scoop as that would be much better for the environment than all those little packets and I'm guessing a lot of people would buy it because the lemon flavor one has almost no color and is available in a zero calorie version.<br /><br />I'll keep looking for a concentrate or powder that isn't too expensive per serving, doesn't have a lot of food coloring in it, and is packaged in a way that generates less waste. In the meantime I'll keep cutting open packets of Propel at home to make pitchers of the stuff, and packets at work to add to my water.

review/text: I just tried the fruit punch for the first time. I like it but it reminds me of a slightly diluted melted Popsicle. Not bad but I think I prefer the powder alternative flavor more as far as taste. What I like is that I can have any amount of water and still use this, it doesn't have to be exactly a water bottle  or pitcher amount. I can have an 8 ounce cup of water or 20 ounces and still use this by altering the amount. Also very convenient to keep in your purse or pocket. I would buy it again for the convenience factor more so than for the flavor.

review/text: I liked the idea of this, but I find this flavor to be way to sweet and strong, especially if you follow the instructions of 1 squeeze per 8 ounce serving.  If you follow that, this fruit punch flavor tastes like slightly watered down but sweeter Hawaiian Punch...which to me is way too sweet and artificial tasting.  If I add about 1 squeeze to 16 ounces it is drinkable as a lightly flavored water, but I still prefer the taste of Propel.  I plan to try a couple other flavors and see if those are better, but I don't think I'll buy this one again.

review/text: My husband has tried quite a few varieties of the Keurig coffee and this one is the best he has liked.  He said it is bold, and strong.  He likes a coffee that you can taste, and that isn't as he puts it "dirty water".  We have been drinking this variety for 1 yr now and have been very impressed.  I would also like to add that I have shopped around for the best deal and it is here... on amazon.com.

review/summary: If you like Peet's coffee
review/text: I'm new to Keurig and formerly a Peet's addict.  I like a very strong dark roast with a thick mouthy feel. I hate watery coffee.<br />So I started with all the extra bolds....having tried Newman's, Timothy's Sumatra bold, Black Tiger, Midnight Madness as<br />well as Emeril's.  So far, Emeril's is my first choice. Best aroma, which definitely sets off the taste buds. Strong full mouth<br />feel, with a bite on the back end. Not french roast bitter, though.  I'm still hoping Peet's will make some k cups but until<br />they do (when I don't want to use my k cup), Emeril's will be my choice.  Surprised because I did not expect this from a<br />coffee with Emeril's name on it.  I run an 8 ounce in my b30 and it's a solid morning drink.

review/text: I was skeptical to buy this coffee for no other reason than it had Emeril's name on it and he has nothing to do with coffee. However, I was pleasantly surprised for the flavor of this coffee. Keurig coffee's tend to be on the weaker side, especially if you want to brew a larger cup, but this coffee is bold and tasty. Your friends and family won't mistake it for Starbucks but it's a great cup of coffee in the morning. Don't let Emeril prevent you from trying this brand!

review/summary: Good strong coffee
review/text: I have a Keurig and use the Emeril cups for my morning has-to-be-strong coffee.  I know many people feel that the other K-cups taste a bit watered down, but these do not!  I often drink my morning cup on the smallest brew size and then work my way up to bigger cups throughout the day as I need less caffeine.  Also, the Emeril's are great with the travel mug setting because they are strong enough that even with all that water it still taste's good.  I use a lot of creamer/splenda though so my taste buds are slightly biased.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the shipping and delivery of this from Amazon took way longer than I expected.  If you need coffee fast - this may not be the way to go, but if you can plan in advance the prices are worth it to order at Amazon (though the absolute best deal is a box of 80 K Cups at BJs).

review/summary: As only Emeril can do!
review/text: This coffee is as big and bold as Emeril himself.<br /><br />One of my personal favorites of all time with the Keurig, it makes a fantastic full bodied cup of coffee without the typical burnt or overly bitter taste normally associated with dark roasted coffees.<br /><br />When brewed an immediate wonderful coffee aroma will fill your kitchen and it develops a very light caramel colored froth that hugs the edge of your cup or mug.<br /><br />A major pick me up, Big Easy Bold holds up to the largest brew sizes and makes a delicious full flavor cup for travel mugs where ordinary K-cup coffees normally become watered down.<br /><br />Brew a small size, top with the froth of scalded milk and you will have the best cappuccino replica you ever tasted at home.<br /><br />Big Easy Bold is best to sit for a brief moment after brewing before adding sugar or another sweetener as the initial "bite" of the coffee quickly mellows into deep rich flavors. I found myself at first adding too much sugar and finding the coffee a tad too sweet a minute later as the flavors settled into one great cup of coffee.<br /><br />If you love rich, full bodied cups of coffee you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />If breakfast blends and watery medium roasts are boring you, kick your cup up a notch, give it a try and fall in love with your coffee again.

And I do like many of the bolder k-cups, such as Midnight Magic and Rainforest Espresso, but those are simply better coffees to me.  Maybe I'll give the Emeril's regular another chance, but it did not win me over the first time around.  As a side-note, I really like the Emeril's decaf--it is much more drinkable to me than the Emeril's regular.

It's in a class by itself.  I love strong coffee,  and I gave this brand a try.  Guess I'll try another, I'm turned off of Emeril.  No Bam, just bust!

review/summary: What's wrong with these K-cups?
review/text: My daughter got a sample of this coffee in her starter pack and raved about it so I bought a box.  The coffee tastes great but out of the five cups I've made so far, two broke open and spewed coffee grounds into my cup and made a real mess.  The one I'm drinking now.....I used a paper towel to try to remove quite a few grounds from the cup so I wouldn't have to throw out three cups of coffee.  This has never happened to me with any other K-cups.<br /><br />I'll stick with Green Mountain Double Black Diamond from now on.  It's great coffee without the mess.<br /><br />Hey Emeril, see what you can do to fix this problem.  I imagine you've lost more than one customer because of it.

review/summary: Emeril's Truck-stop Slag
review/text: Someone recently bought a Keurig to share at work and also bought a box of about 8 different coffees for it.  Most of them were pretty good.  There were decent tasting representatives spanning a nice range of roast.  Of the selection, only this one (Emeril's big easy bold) was truly unpalatable.

review/summary: A little unbalanced
review/text: I love good strong coffee. It's a combination on how it's roasted and the beans used. This coffee is just way too strong. It is unbalanced and though isn't bitter (which comes from weaker coffee) it is a tad over roasted and charred tasting. Instead of tasting toasty nuances you are stuck with a smack in the face. Though very good for that wake up coffee, it's not the coffee to have if you want to savor the rich and delicate nuances that many good coffees bring to the table.

review/summary: My new favourite for a nice bold morning brew
review/text: When using a drip coffee maker, I often slipped in an extra spoonful of grounds to make my morning coffee extra strong so that the milk would not dilute it too much.  After recently having bought a Keurig, I was a bit disappointed at the somewhat watered-down light-bodied taste of most of the K-Cups which came as a sample with it.<br /><br />So my first inclination was to browse the Amazon reviews of several varieties of K-Cup coffee and take advantage of what others who like a nice strong bold cup of coffee had learnt by trial and error - and that was a good move!  I took you all at your word, ordered a 50-pack of this coffee on Monday, had my first cup of it this morning, and decided it was worth submitting my first ever review of any Amazon product ever, both to give it a 5-star rating myself and to thank those of you who take the time & trouble to give honest reviews for the benefit of people like me.<br /><br />So for the record, on a price and quality scale this is my new favourite K-Cup coffee.  Until now, my favourite on a pure quality scale was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008C9QEVU">Starbucks Caff&egrave; Verona, Dark Roast, 27-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> (excellent but very pricey!) and for a bold-yet-affordable cup was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I3I4">Green Mountain Coffee Double Black Diamond, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a> (also excellent, and less pricey, but IMO not quite as nice in flavour as Emeril's "Big Easy Bold").<br /><br />For anyone looking for a nice strong full-bodied and flavourful K-Cup coffee which won't break the bank, do try this one. If you're like me you won't be disappointed.

review/text: This is a good choice for a K-Cup if you like a bold rich cup of coffee. I ordered this brand for 3-4 months because it  was the best tasting bold K-Cup I found.<br /><br />I am giving it three stars because the last few shipments were not that great. It left both me and my husband with a weird metallic taste after one cup.<br /><br />I ordered Martinson's bold K-Cups about a month ago and loved it! I probably will not buy this brand again.

review/summary: Pretty good if you don't get one with a defective seal
review/text: This coffee actually tastes pretty good for a darker roast however the number of defective K-cups with seal problems can be significant.  The issue is that the seal covering the Kcup, which gets punctured to enable the drip through, seems to continually burst open during brewing, resulting in coffee grounds in your mug and quite a mess of the machine.  My wife and I have started calling these "bursters" as it happens quite frequently with these Emeril's Kcups.  You can clearly hear it from far away when you get a burster and I think if you were to be doing something directly over the machine (such as putting dishes away in a cabinet above it) there is a possibility of getting in contact with some of the scalding hot steam from the sudden release of the pressure when the seal breaks open.  The seal bursts right at the final peak brewing time, probably at about the last 30% of the brewing process.  The result are a lot of coffee grounds in your mug and over the machine brewing area.<br /><br />I have been buying a lot of Kcups quite frequently in bulk that past few months.  I've tried many different types of Kcups and have purchased several hundred of each, I have never had this happen to any except the Emeril ones.  This is not just an isolated incident, there a significant number of defective ones in each of the 18 count boxes.  Usually if you get a box which has a burster you are going to get quite a few in there, probably around 5 at least.<br /><br />Wherever these specific Kcups are being made, there is a clearly a problem in the manufacturing processing and quality controls checks.  I've also seen a few cases where I have gotten a Kcup that has 2 seals pressed onto it thus resulting in a broken seal right out of the box.<br /><br />The coffee actually tastes pretty good, I really like darker roasts and this is one of my favorite ones however the quality control needs to be significantly improved.  If I was paying full retail for these I would be pretty annoyed, I think I've paid full retail for these once at a premium supermarket and sure enough there were a couple bursters in that box so it is not an issue with the bulk purchases or anything like that.  As I said I've bought hundreds of other brands in bulk and have had no issues yet.

review/summary: be careful!
review/text: I purchased this product for my husband who loves very bold coffee.  Each time we have made the coffee in our Keurig it explodes all over.  (Clearly after the third try I have now thrown the rest away) We were lucky to always be away from the coffee maker, but if you were standing there it would have burned you.  All the other types off coffee that we have used and continue to use work perfectly, so I know that the Emeril coffee was the problem.  If you have kids keep them away from the coffee maker.

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: We got this flavor because it was A)on sale and B)Emerils- it should be tasty, right? WRONG. I won't go on and on about how much I dislike it, and it's all personal taste, but I like strong coffee and this is strong...in the wrong way. It tastes like burnt cigarettes smell. Like cigarette butts. And its aroma matches, making this non-smoker's house smell like a lounge. It is thick as tar and even if diluted with water, still retains a burnt ash taste that coats the inside of my mouth. We have had a 12 pack for over 6 months...the last two are going in the garbage, like tossing away a dollar bill. I'll stick to Dark Magic for a nice strong coffee. But, if you like that smokey flavor, this may be good for you. I personally feel like I licked an ashtray and have to brush my teeth after every sip. Blech!...maybe I did go on and on about how much I didn't like it. Oh well, don't say I didn't warn you!
