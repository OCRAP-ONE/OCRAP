ALTHOUGH THESE ARE EXPENSIVE, I WOULD STILL BUY THEM JUST FOR USE WHEN HIKING OR BIRDWATCHING.

review/summary: No taste then after taste
review/text: I was looking for some apple snacks and read the good reviews on this brand so bought a 24 pack. I just received them today, opened up a package and I am enormously disappointed. They are crunchy, as the package said, but this is where the good points end. They do not have a very strong apple taste, in fact my first thought was 'burned' something. I don't know why but this was how it tasted to me. Also, after each bite, there is a mildly bitter after taste. I have tried several dried apple products and have never experienced a bitter after taste until this product. I am very sorry to have wasted so much money on so many of them. For anyone who still wants to try them, I will give you a tip - they are sold elsewhere on Amazon.com in a package of 12 instead of the 24 sold here. 11 would have been a lot easier to get rid of than 23. :(

Amazon quickly sent out another case Overnight!  Great service.<br /><br />I had never heard of the refried kidney beans, but wanted to try them.  I could not find them in a local store so I took the plunge with these.  We only eat Eden Organic canned beans.  I like them for the lack of added sodium and the BPA free cans.  These beans did not dissappoint.  The kidney beans have more moisture in them than the pinto or black refried beans.<br /><br />I will be ordering them again.

review/summary: Gatorade works great, but quantity is skimpy for the price
review/text: While exercising in the hot southern California sun, it's vital to keep hydrated and to replace salt and other minerals lost while sweating. I bike ride for two to three hours on weekend days and drink quarts of Gatorade. Gatorade mix is the most economical way to do this. Previously, Costco sold big $12 jars of Gatorade mix that each made 6 gallons, but now I can't find that size anywhere. These small jars (each makes two gallons) look a lot bigger online than their real-life 4" height. Counting shipping, each costs about $11. Not worth it; I'll keep looking.

review/text: I bought these instead of chef boyardee trying to have a "healthy" late-night college dorm snack, but I really can't stand the taste. Unfortunately, if you are looking for a Chef Boyardee alternative, you will be disappointed. These are healthier but still not an alternative due to the disgusting sweet tomato sauce (if you can even call it tomato sauce). It's so sweet that it tastes like bland ketchup.<br /><br />The remaining 11 cans of my pack are going to be donated at the next canned food drive.

review/summary: a good example of how "organic" does NOT always equal "tasty"
review/text: Oy. I found these on sale at a local grocery store and decided to try them, hoping they'd be deelish and I could start ordering them from Amazon. No luck.<br /><br />First of all, I should have known they'd be a bit. . .well, bland. The tomato  "sauce" is a product of water and tomato paste, which I normally wouldn't consider worth much. The sauce is a very light red color (more orange than red, really), very thin (by my standards, anyway), and an oddly bland sweet flavor that really did not light my fire. Of course, nothing canned ever stands up to the "real" thing, but this is, to me, beyond the norm when it comes to blandness.<br /><br />The ravioli themselves are very mushy and tend to separate as soon as I touch them with my fork. The bottom layer comes off, the cheese inside begins to mix with the sauce, and soon I have pasta squares instead of ravioli. A cheesy blandness rather than the original tomatoey blandness. Yuck.<br /><br />They aren't the worst I've ever had, but I was hoping I would like them more than the usual crap out there, like the Chef Boyardee ravioli (which actually taste good in comparison to these--yowsa!).<br /><br />I give this product a three because of the ingredients being organic, but man--spice it up a little, Annie's! Or at least, add some tomato chunks in there, or maybe use pasta that won't separate when you barely touch it.

review/text: Okay, so they're not restaurant-quality ravioli taste-wise. What out of a can is? But if you compare them to other canned pasta products, these are just as good!<br /><br />AND they're organic, which means no fields were sprayed with petroleum-based poisons (that's what chemical pesticides are after all) or watershed-harming petroleum-based chemical fertilizers (Google "Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone" and you'll see what I'm talking about).<br /><br />I like to keep these around for those times when you need something quick and easy. For more flavor, it's simple to doctor them with a dash of parmesan cheese and a pinch of basil (fresh, if it's in season), and then you've got a nice, tasty vegetarian meal!

There is salt but the overall taste is sweet corn and the salt is just a nice accent.

In fact, after reading the reviews saying these are too salty, I was expecting more salt.  Those people must eat very little salt to be overwhelmed by this product.  I taste salt, but just enough to set off the sweetness of the corn.<br />I also love the fact that the only ingredients are corn and sea salt.  How much healthier can you get for a packaged, crunchy snack?

Buy these for your next party and you will be everyone's hero.

review/summary: NOT SALTY
review/text: I don't normally review items, but I had to write something on this because all of these "it's too salty" comments are driving me crazy. These are hardly salty at all.<br /><br />There is far more salt in potatoe chips or popcorn or basically any other snack food. My bag says its only 8% of your daily sodium, which is much lower than you would think from the comments people are leaving. I'm a man, so I personally think these could use MORE salt.

I went and bought a 24 pack which I finished in less than a week, because it was that good! Many of my family member who've tried it called and asked me where I've got it and apparently I pointed them to Amazon of course. They found it a little weird that Amazon sells food, haha. The only person that doesn't like the corn was my mom, she said it's weird. All in all, it was a very tasty and healthy snack :)

It is hard for me to get enough fiber in our diets, and this has fiber as well as a wonderful sweet fresh-picked sweet corn taste. How on earth the manufacturers managed to capture that taste is a miracle! My daughter says "It is crunchy and then it melts in your mouth. It's so good!" Highly recommended!

This is a sweeter ketchup, unlike it's other major competator, which is more salty, and has slighly less tomato flavor.  This is a great standard to keep in your fridge.

review/summary: Satan's Ghost - A review
review/text: The smell is what tells you your dealing with the Bhut Jolokia. The taste and heat are what get you coming back to the bottle. On a 1-10 heat scale I'd rate this sauce at a 6.5 - 7. 1 Would be a basic jalapeno sauce and 10 being a raw ghost chili. This sauce has an incredible smell to it. You can smell the floral-ness of the ghost and habanero. The sauce although hot isn't extreme out of the gate. If you use this on wings, nacho, etc it will build but adds great flavor unlike many other "ghost" sauce. In comparison this is 100x more palatable than Dave's ghost chili sauce.<br /><br />I've gone through 4 bottles and just ordered 2 more. at $17.99 the price is about 6 more than I'd like to pay.<br /><br />Overall a great product, about 1/3 overpriced, but if your looking a sauce you can enjoy and get some nice lasting heat out of this is the one.

review/summary: Not the quality of the first time I ordered
review/text: This is the 2nd time I have ordered and these cookies arrived packed in the box, not in a plastic bag as the previous order.  The cookies were stale.  The first order was definitely fresh - this order was extremely disappointing.  I will probably go back and pay a little extra to pick up the 12 unit box at the local grocery - I am very disappointed in the quality and freshness of this product

review/text: I feel bad for the previous reviewer - maybe it was an error on La Choy's part? Each box we've ever purchased come with each cookie individually wrapped. There are cheaper ones out there but I prefer La Choy because they'll stay fresher longer due to the individual wrappings.

review/summary: Stale and Crushed
review/text: Shipped very quick. However the US Mail "shoebox" the 96 were crammed into was crushed in delivery and many cookies were in pieces.  Upon taste, the cookies were stale and soft.  The "fortune" insert was not really a fortune or an inspirational saying but a quote that lost the point after it was translated.  Very disappointing.

review/summary: Good Product - Bad Shipping
review/text: My husband loves the fortune cookies and was looking forward to receiving these.  When they arrived the box was crushed on two sides destroying over 1/3 of the cookies.  The box was marked fragile but there was not packing inside to protect the cookies (basically just fortune cookies in a cardboard shipping box).  Very disappointed.

review/summary: Tasty Individually Wrapped Cookies
review/text: I bought these to make chocolate dipped cookies for Chinese New Year.  I chose these after reading the one review stating that they were only wrapped in one big bag in each box, but was disappointed to find them individually wrapped (though this will probably be good for everyone else).  If I had known that, I would have just bought the big 96-pack.<br /><br />Needing the cookies to be whole for dipping, here are my general comments:<br />- average &lt;1 per 12 pc box not folded shut enough to dip or had fortune falling out and couldn't be dipped<br />- average 1-2 per box were broken and could not be used<br /><br />As for freshness, these cookies are 3 months away from expiration and taste great!

review/summary: Low fat snacks that reveal your future!
review/text: You don't have to go to a Chinese restaurant to enjoy Fortune Cookies. FCE & I go through a carton a month--we buy LaChoy Fortune Cookies by subscription! Each one is approximately 30 calories, no cholesterol, no sodium, and if you ate an entire boxful you'd only be downing 5% of your daily fat value (based on a 2K cal a day diet). They satisfy the craving for sweets, without doing terrible dietary damage, and give us good advice. What other snackfood does that? Oh...and they're yummy!

Gradually made the change from her old food to the new and she hates it. She has thrown up twice so far. I will be taking my loss and throwing the rest out. Back to her old food. It may be great for some dogs, just didn't work for mine.

review/summary: Made both my dogs vomit and eat less.
review/text: We switched to this food from Purina One because the ingredients are advertised to be of much higher quality, and we wanted to improve our dogs' diet. We made a smooth transition to this food by slowly mixing it in with their existing food, as vets recommend. Once the transition was complete, they were vomiting their meals several times per week, which they had never done before the switch. We continued to feed them this food for about a month to see if it changed, and they still have problems keeping it down. I often see them eating grass to induce vomiting as well, so I think its giving them a stomach ache. They also got to the point where they just didn't want to eat the food at all sometimes, which I've never seen them do. We switched to Newman's Own dog food now, and they're eating much better already.<br /><br />I wish I had done some research on this food before purchasing it. Type "Wellness dog food vomit" into Google, and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product.

review/text: Wellness Super5Mix is a high quality dog food. Yes, it costs more than the junk you can buy in Wal-Mart, but as with most things in life, you get what you pay for.  Wellness keeps my beagle regular with no indigestion or diarrhea. I've tried switching to cheaper brands, but they leave him gassy, listless, and constipated. My dog isn't crazy about the taste. Of course, he'd prefer canned or, even better, table scraps. But he does eat the Wellness, and it keeps him healthy.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: A sub-par version of store bought Wellness
review/text: We've been buying this exact formula of Wellness for our Cocker Spaniel "Lucy" for over a year now.  We thought that it would be worth purchasing on Amazon since it was priced almost identically and it would be more convenient than going to Petsmart since it would be delivered to our front door.  We didn't receive the food for well over a week after we ordered it so we were forced to buy a small bag at the store until we received the food.  No big deal...we figured next time we'll just order it a couple of weeks in advance so that Lucy's food supply isn't as low and we have plenty until we get the next bag.  After feeding her two meals of the bag we got from Amazon, Lucy started having violent diarrhea.  I'm familiar with the fact that changing foods can cause an upset stomach with dogs but this is the exact same food we have been feeding her for a very long time.....or so we thought.  We knew that the only thing that changed in Lucy's diet was the fact that we ordered the food from Amazon.  So we went and bought another small bag of the same stuff from Petsmart.  Much to our disappointment, there was an obvious difference in the appearance of the food.  The bag from Amazon had chunks that were misshaped, very porous and even smelled different.  Our conclusion was that Amazon received the reject bags at a discount and sold them as the same product.  We then stopped feeding Lucy the Amazon bag and switched her back to the store bought bag.  Immediately her bowls improved.  Although we were refunded for our purchase we had to jump through a few hoops that weren't worth the time we wasted to do so.  Please reconsider before you purchase this food.  Wellness is an Amazing product and we're proud to feed our little Lucy the best food that we possibly can but this is not up to the quality that Wellness is known for.  I'm going to post pics of both the Amazon bought food and the Store bought food so that you can see the difference.

review/summary: NOT a cure-all if that's what you're looking for
review/text: My dog has severe allergies as well as a sensitive stomach. After thousands of dollars, allergy shots, etc. I decided to give the fish and sweet potato a try because for years everyone has raved about how much better it is for dogs who are allergic to the typical proteins, etc. in kibble.  Well, let me say...I'm disappointed.  It's been six weeks and I've seen no difference in the itching/licking and scratching.  The fish breath? I can live with that but whoooooo-weeee the GAS that this stuff caused for not only my allergic dog but also my "stomach of steel" dog. They can clear the HOUSE in about two seconds flat.<br /><br />While I do appreciate the quality ingredients that are supposedly in this food, I am disappointed that I've seen absolutely no difference between this and the Pro Plan or Natural Balance I tried before this. Could it be just my dog, sure. But all in all, if you're looking for a magic cure, sorry to say this isn't the one it's hyped to be.

review/text: I have had my German Shepherd on Canidae (chicken) since she was a puppy and did wonderful. Well, Canidae had a recall last winter & I had to switch her, so I tried Wellness (chicken).  I have to say, I am really disappointed with this dog food. Besides her not really liking it, her breathe smells bad, has very loose to diarrhea stools, and she has been licking her paws & shaking her head like her ears are bugging her ( which she never has done before and that is a sign of allergies). I noticed the chicken formula is back on the market and I will for sure be switching.

But, Wellness wasn't selling enough of the Salmon and Rice - so, they took if off the market.  No Warnings, no advice to begin to seek out an alternative - just, gone.  He is now vomiting on the Wellness replacement - and we're seeking yet another alternative - but, it won't be from this company.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED
review/text: I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. But I just thought I'd try to give everyone a heads up though.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying
