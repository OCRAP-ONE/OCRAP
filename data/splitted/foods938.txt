review/summary: Best if eaten right away --
review/text: If you're going to be baking this in your bread machine, then sharing it with friends/family right away, it's yummy with a dab of butter. However, if you let it cool and put it away for the night, it becomes too dense to enjoy, and the flavor changes significantly with the dill.<br /><br />I tried toasting it on day 2, and it still has far too much of the stale dill flavor to work.<br /><br />Most other potato breads I've made have been light, fluffy, and exceptionally soft -- this one is not.<br /><br />These mixes are more expensive than some of the other brands, and makes a much smaller loaf than I'd expected, too -- so I'll be passing on this one in the future.

review/summary: Are these magical?
review/text: Pros: All you have to do is hold up the bag and our dog runs for his crate. He's so excited about this treat! Smells awesome! Dog parents like it too because they are all natural (nothing you couldn't eat yourself) and they are made in the US (locally if you live near Pennsylvania as we do).<br /><br />Cons: Nothing that should keep you from buying this product! Yes, it's a little more expensive, but you get what you pay for. Also, we'd like a bag that was resealable (the tin tie at the top tends to wear out before we go through a whole bag). The other funny thing is that sometimes people mistake them for people food.

review/summary: Excellent Tea
review/text: we have been using the store bought version of Ahmad Earl Grey Tea for a long time and had found it superior to other Earl Grey teas e.g. Bigelow, Twinings, Stash etc. By accident I found the 4.41 oz packaged tea on Amazon and immediately ordered 6 boxes. This tea has a much stronger and intense flavor than the one sold in grocery stores, one bag alone makes a wonderful pot of tea. I have found a fabulous product and can recommend it to all tea lovers.

review/summary: Excellent, reliable yeast and will last a long time!
review/text: I keep this yeast in my freezer and it always performs for me (I've had SAF yeast last years in the freezer with no problems). I usually re-vacuum-seal and freeze half of a pound of SAF and then keep the other half also in the freezer in an airtight, stainless steel container. This yeast can last about 9 years sealed in the freezer without losing much oomph at all (and probably STILL more active than most store-shelf yeasts sold at the supermarket).<br /><br />This yeast rises FAST if you put your covered bowl or pan of dough in the sink with some warm water (or placed in a slightly warmed oven) and it works far better than expensive "bread-machine yeast" if you use a bread-machine.<br /><br />If you make a lot of sweet dough which requires more sugar, then add some citric acid and powdered milk to help aid the yeast to rise (about 1/2 teaspoon citric acid and 1 teaspoon powdered milk per batch of bread dough) or you can buy Saf's 'special' yeast (gold package) for doughs that use more sugar.<br /><br />If you've been disappointed with your baking endeavors in the past, it was probably the crappy yeast and not your baking skills, so get thee some quality baking yeast and you'll have success at long last.<br /><br />Happy baking!

review/summary: stays potent for years
review/text: I've been using SAF yeast for 15 years.  I keep the unopened pouches in the freezer.  When I open a pouch, I pour it onto a pint-sized plastic jar to keep in the refrigerator.  I use the plastic jar to refill a smaller jar, from which I get yeast when I make dough.  That way, I don't have to open the larger jar often.  It may sit in the refrigerator four years before I finish it.  It still seems as potent as freshly purchased yeast.

review/summary: FOUR pounds of yeast
review/text: I have been making bread machine bread for about four years now.  Until recently I'd been using the little brown jars of Fleischmann's or Red Star bread machine yeast because I thought that was all there was.  Then my local markets stopped carrying that variety.  The little packets are way too expensive and I had a sad experience with cratered loaves and uneven texture when one cookbook assured me that active dry yeast would work fine with bread machines.<br /><br />This yeast is amazing.  Once I figured out the exact amount to use with my machine I've been getting beautifully rounded, fine textured whole wheat loaves every single time. It's stunningly better than the stuff you buy in the grocery store.  I've been following the other reviewers' advice on how to store and keep the yeast, since I think I've got enough for several years.  I wasn't quite clear on how much yeast I was buying here.  One pound seemed a better deal than the grocery stores offer.  But four pounds . . . it's practically free.

review/text: SAF is great yeast to start.  Love it.  If you have problems with your bread not rising, it's probably your yeast.  Who knows how long those packages have been in the store, they don't even have expiration dates on them.  SAF has an expiration date, it's vacuum sealed and there's no chance of water getting in, activating your yeast, and making them useless.<br /><br />Plus, I paid for four lbs what I would have paid for a single jar.  I open up one package, put it in a container in the fridge, and store the rest in the freezer.  My understanding is that they'll last two years past the expiry date that way. :)

review/summary: The gold standard
review/text: SAF instant yeast is the gold standard of baking. Never thought a change in yeast could make that much difference in baking but it does. Breads baked with the SAF yeast come out finer grained and tend to rise better than when baked with other brands of yeast. While this may seem like a lot of yeast, and it is, you can store the yeast in the freezer. I keep it tightly sealed in a plastic freezer container.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/summary: Great Yeast for No Kneed Bread
review/text: I have been baking great no kneed bread for awhile using recipes from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312362919">Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking</a> book using the yeast available from a local "big box" store. Although the results from the yeast available locally has always been great, the price for the yeast has not.<br /><br />Even buying the yeast in the small 4Oz "bulk" jars locally is ~$1 an ounce, and that really adds up over time if you bake a lot.<br /><br />To get this much yeast locally would have been over four times as expensive!<br /><br />This yeast comes in four individual one pound packages. This is great because you can open one package at a time, and you can store the rest sealed in the freezer. I did a bit of research to find out how long these unopened packages can stay fresh in the freezer.<br /><br />Many different websites are claiming that an unopened one pound package of this yeast should stay fresh up to 10 years in the freezer before losing potency. This is good news for most home bakers who are worried about buying so much yeast at once.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase. The price is very low for how much yeast you get, it's conveniently packaged, you can store it (unopened) for years in your freezer, and the yeast is of very high quality.

I used what I thought was a live sourdough starter for a 3-lb. loaf of rye bread.  No go.  In desperation, I FOLDED some of this yeast into the already kneaded dough, kneaded some more to get the yeast hopefully evenly distributed.  I'm sitting here looking at the loaf that's JUST come out of the oven.  Beautifully risen, beautifully scented.  Haven't tasted it yet, but am sure as hell looking forward to it.<br /><br />This stuff is great...and at the PRICE?  It don't get much better'n that.

review/summary: Easy to use!
review/text: I've used this yeast for quite a few years, and it is wonderful.  The thing I love about it the most is that it can be mixed with the dry ingredients, then all the wet ingredients can be added after they've been heated quite hot (too hot to touch for more than a moment).  This yeast can stand the heat as long as it is buffered by the other dry ingredients.  I have often simplified recipes which called for proofing, or for scalding milk, then letting it cool, with this method, with great results.  For example, today I made this bread:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Rather than worrying about the temperatures of the milk and water, I simply melted the butter, added the water and milk to it, and heated it until quite hot, then added it to my mixture of yeast and other dry ingredients.  Works like a charm.  I keep it in the freezer in a ziploc bag and it lasts for years.  Highly recommended.

review/text: Just received my 4-pack, and baked some bread. I am very happy with the results. Good yeast! I put it in a ziplock bag, and am refrigerating it so I can get more use out of it. The bags are vacuum-packed, so they should stay fresh until they are opened (though the package has a "best if used by" for 2 years after the manufacture date). I ordered this in March, and it was manufactured/produced in November, so it is pretty fresh.  I had previously made the mistake of getting active dry yeast, rather than instant yeast, which didn't work so great.  I guess you have to proof the dry yeast, but the instant yeast can go directly in with the flour.

review/summary: Fantastic, but way too much of it
review/text: I ordered this because I wanted to get something better than the lame dead yeast packets from the supermarket.  So far I've made pizza dough, bagels, and french bread with this yeast, and it seems to work good so far.<br /><br />One thing I've noticed is that I've gotten a very reliable and consistent rise from this yeast whereas the little packets were very inconsistent. It imparts a good flavor on the dough and I'm really happy I switched to SAF.<br /><br />I really wish they'd sell this in a one or two pack instead of a 4 pack.  4 pounds of yeast is a lot of yeast.  If I ever get through that much, I wonder if the last package will still be alive.

review/summary: Wonderful Yeast
review/text: Until recently I'd been using the little brown jars of Fleischmann's or Red Star bread machine yeast because that's what was available at my local supermarkets. However I do a lot of baking and the little 4 oz jars just don't last long. So I went online and found this product. You get 16x the amount compared to the little jars. I looked the reviews and then ordered. This yeast is amazing. Rises wonderfully, it has been consistent every time. I like that it has expiration dates that are well into the future. I will continue to buy this yeast in the future once I use what I have.

review/text: I am a Home Economist and I owned a bakery many years ago.  Recently I decided to start making bread again at home.  I bought some yeast at the grocery store and was not pleased with it, so I went on-line and looked for the saf-instant yeast that we always used in our bakery.  I was so happy to find it and for such a reasonable price.  It works quickly and just as well as I remembered.  I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Lasts for years in the freezer, great price and performance!
review/text: I do a lot of baking with yeast - bread, rolls, pizza dough - and I like the SAF brand.  A friend told me about this 4-pound value pack and I am very happy with it!<br /><br />Each pound comes vacuum sealed in a heavy mylar bag, and fits perfectly on the door of my garage freezer.  I pour one bag into a sealed glass canister that I keep for daily use, and store that in my kitchen freezer.  I use it right out of the freezer and it works perfectly.  I've used 2 year old yeast without any diminishing of rising power.  SAF yeast produces light, fluffy bread and rolls, and it rises faster than some other brands.<br /><br />This 4-pack is a great deal at $13.63, especially compared to the single use packets or small jars at the grocery store.  Add in free SuperSaver shipping (on orders over $25) and it's a super deal.

review/summary: simply the best!
review/text: I discovered this brand of yeast a few years back when troubleshooting issues with my first bread machine; I found that not only did it solve the problems of less than perfect results from the machine but it improved the results with my hand kneaded loaves as well. I bake in smaller quantities for a single person and only a few times a week so this size was more than I could use but still more economical than the smaller packages. I store it in the coldest part of my refrigerator in an airtight container. At the two year mark it was still "active" and producing good loaves, but I'd rather not discover the hard way when it is truly past its peak so I've purchased it again. Excellent results every time!<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/text: I have been using SAF yeast for the last 4 years. I have gone through alot of it. One pouch will last me around 6 months. I make our bread, 8 loaves a week some weeks. Other weeks not so much. I do lots of baking for my family. I usually have one pouch in the freezer and I keep a Tupperware container in the fridge with yeast in it.<br />For about a year to a year and a half, I did not bake anything. The yeast just sat in the fridge, as I had no back up. I used it anyways, worried that it was dead. Lo and behold, it was still good and my bread still raised just fine. No issues. I love the stuff.

The package isn't emblazoned with a Made in Mexico tag so they're careful not to advertise the fact, and the single Amazon photo pictured doesn't show the country of origin.  Minus two stars for failure to disclose.<br /><br />For the record, I love Mexican food, have traveled to Mexico and have Mexican friends; I'm not anti-Mexico.  I'm pro disclosure.

review/summary: Gave me wrinkled tops
review/text: I've baked bread for years, and decided to try this yeast. My loaves had wrinkled tops. I tried slower rises, warmer rises, three rises, slower oven, faster oven, stiffer loaf, slacker dough, more salt, and after 15 tries, I gave up. I'm going back to red star from Costco which gives me a nice smooth dome every time.<br /><br />However, if you have a few pounds of yeast to get rid of, you can have a really bang up day of experiments with the kids. Get out every bowl in the house and vary conditions: warmth, sugar contend, tap vs. distilled water, boiling water (no growth at all!), a bit of WW flour or cornmeal or white, etc. Last fling of the day was rising a whole pound in a huge bowl in the sink and watching it overflow like lava. We charted it all, and suprise! rather warm water with more yeast and sugar did the most vigorous growth.

Love chocolate (entirely too much) and love chai (heck yes!), could be a match made in tea heaven... and guess what?  Yes it is! Holy Hiccups Batman! This stuff is good! I tried it hot with just boiling water and yum! It tastes like a spiced hot cocoa.  Since I live in the desert, had to have it iced and wow!  Yum!  I follow the directions and add enough hot water to mix up the powder and then 1 ice cube (I really don't care for a lot of ice), just enough to bring the temperature down and then add the remainder with Soy milk and wow!  This is a win.  I keep one bag in my desk at work (share it with another coworker) and the two at home.  I am in loooooooooooovvvvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeee.

review/text: I liked the idea of something that was in between hot chocolate and chai, but in the end it turns out that I would much rather have hot chocolate OR chai. That being said, there's nothing *wrong* with it, per se. It's reasonably tasty, dissolves well, has a nice mouthfeel for a "just add water" mix, and a good level of sweetness (if you're looking for a hot-chocolate-like "treat"). I'd try Big Train's other offerings, but before getting this one, you might want to ask yourself if you'd do better to just have some hot chocolate and chai mixes on hand so that you can drink what you're actually wanting rather than some halfway concoction.

review/text: I love chai and I love hot chocolate so I was excited to try this. I ended up being disappointed. It tastes nothing like chai but rather more like hot chocolate. Unfortunately it's not even a very tasty hot chocolate. It's definitly drinkable, don't get me wrong, but not something I'd go out of my way to order on Amazon. Give me more of that chai spicyness! I simply won't buy it again and that is why I give it 3 stars not 4. This was my first time drinking chocolate chai and if this is what it's supposed to taste like I'll stick to either just hot chocolate or just chai tea. I have brands of both I love!

review/summary: Big Train's Chais are the best!
review/text: Vanilla is the best flavor, but chocolate and spiced are also great.  So that you can guage how close your taste is to mine, I'll compare it to a few other brands I've tried. I also drink Tazo Chai (It's what Starbucks sells.  Get it at Target in the soymilk-sized box. It's cheaper and tastes just as good.).  Tazo is good, but Big Train is much better.  I don't like whatever it is they sell at Seattle's Best or Coffee Bean.  Both are a little weak for me.  I also don't like Oregon Chai (also a little too weak.  If you add more chai than milk, then it's too sweet.).  Some may think Big Train is too sweet, but I feel like it's perfect.  Try it, you won't be dissappointed.

review/summary: Great easy chai!
review/text: I bought this chai from Trader Joe's years ago, but they stopped carrying it. Recently, something reminded me of it, so I ordered a bag! It's just as good as I remembered. It's surprisingly chocolatey, sweet, and good, especially considering it's made with hot water, and not with milk! I'm curious to try the vanilla flavor too.

review/summary: Great chocolate chai
review/text: Big train makes the best chai mix I have found, mainly because it is good with milk, good with water, good with a little of both!  Pretty sweet, so if you prefer your chai more spicy, less sweet, this may not the drink for you.  I have added some dark chocolate shavings to this and it is a great dessert drink.  The vanilla chai is also excellent from this company.  Have been drinking this for 4+ years, and tried many different chais at many a coffee shop and this remains my favorite, way better than the liquid concentrates you see in stores.

review/summary: Awful stuff
review/text: I would have wanted to know that sugar is the first ingredient. That it is not pure chocoate and chai, but there are indredients that I don't want and cannot have, such as corn syrup and artificial flavors. You don't need artificial anything with real chai and real chocoate.<br /><br />The test is gagging: it is far too sweet. I will never drink it, and I would not serve it to my family. I'm thinking of giving it to a soup kitchen, but frankly, I don't like the idea of anyone consuming this product.

review/summary: Excellent Source of Protein for Snacking
review/text: As a Certified Personal Trainer, I am always looking for products to recommend to my clients.  Of course, I would never recommend anything that I have not tried for myself FIRST.  Free range turkey jerky is an excellent choice for snacking, and Shelton's is by far the BEST TASTING! The flavor is not too spicy, but certainly not bland either.  The jerky's texture is very chewable, not leather-like.  Even my elderly clients can chew it. Being turkey, not beef, it saves you calories and fat.  It is a great source of (antibiotic-free) protein that does not make you feel bloated, so it perfect for snacking.  No need to worry about refrigeration after opening, so you can carry it in your gym bag and have the perfect post-workout protein snack.  I also recommend my clients keep it at work so they can avoid being tempted by the vending machines.  Amazon has it at a GREAT price!!

review/summary: Not-too-sweet Jerky
review/text: This jerky is not the usual over-sweetened, mushy jerky that seems to be popular today.  If that is what you like, this is not your jerky.  For folks who like their jerky flavorful but not sweet, this is peppered but not super spicy.  The texture is dry and hard like traditional jerky, rather than soft and oily.  It takes some chewing but it is not overly tough.

review/text: I ordered the 6 pack of Shelton's Turkey Jerky.  With great anticipation, I opened the first package.  Much to my disappointment, the jerky was quite dry and brittle.  I was hoping for something more like Trader Joe's turkey jerky which is always moist and tasty.  I will eventually eat what I ordered, but unlike the Trader Joe's brand, this stuff will hang around until I'm desperate for anything to munch on.

And knowing that it's turkey, you know you're eating a fairly healthy snack, too. Love this stuff, I'm hooked!

review/text: I have been buying this turkey jerky for several years.  Love it!! Because it is turkey, it contains less fat than traditional beef jerky. Do not be fooled into thinking that because it it turkey is is without flavor!!  This peppered jerky will satisfy your craving with a kick of spice.  It is not sweet or barbecue flavored, just great peppered turkey taste.  The 12, one ounce packages are perfect for the gym bag as an after workout snack, or take them to work and eat them instead of something nasty out of the vending machine! You will not be disappointed.

review/text: I have never had worst product.  It was extremely hard and tasteless.  I can't believe that I paid so much for it.  I gave it two stars instead of one so people will read this review.  Of course I couldn't return it because they call it food.  The package picture misrepresents the product.  Very little brown turkey,  I would never buy it at a store.  I will read the negative reviews first from now on, which were the truth, not the over abundance of five star.  I was going to say that I will never order food products again from Amazon but I have bought very good Stevia Chocolate before.

review/text: This turkey jerky is really bad quality jerky. It comes as a bunch of tiny extremely thin pressed bits in tiny bags. The little pieces are dry, bad tasting and look like they are reconstituted without any texture to them at all. I have been getting jerky from a place called Mountain America Jerky which recently raised their prices and so I am trying Amazon.com merchants. This jerky is really really bad. The other Amazon.com merchant I have tried for turkey jerky is Golden Valley which is much much better than this jerky. Don't get this stuff at all. It is really bad. Try the Golden Valley jerky also here at amazon. That at least has some decent flavor and you can tell it once was a turkey! This stuff is just awful.

review/text: Neither of my two cats would eat these treats. In fact, neither of my dogs would eat them either-- and they're willing to eat the occasional "cat cookie"! I looked on the package and it looks like the main ingredient is corn meal. These treats look and smell like cheap dog food, not fish. The scent is not at all appealing. So basically I paid for an overpriced 3 oz. bag of corn meal based pet food and now I'm stuck with a bag because none of my four pets will eat it.

review/text: My cat is a big fan of all the Greenies products, and these are no exception.  She's usually very picky about what she'll eat - nothing from the grocery store is acceptable to her refined palate, evidently - so I was thrilled to find something so inexpensive and easy-to-find.  Another bonus is that the ingredients are pronounceable, so I don't feel like I'm giving her garbage for treats.  I always have a couple bags in the house, and my cat can hear me just pick up the bag - and she comes running.
