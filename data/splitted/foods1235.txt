review/text: Amazing in terms of taste. Don't get these if you want a snack that isn't tempting.<br />By the way, they sell a one serving version of these at Starbucks but it isn't labeled Sahale Snacks (its written in fine print on the back). You get a lot more value buying them through Amazon/Sahale directly.

review/summary: Mostly just really sweet cashews
review/text: The combination sounded wonderful and the picture was enticing but that isn't exactly what I received.  The cashews were crunchy and very sweet but I had a hard time finding the pomegranate like in the photo or even near it.  First 2 handfuls there was nada.  At the end there was a little which added an almost discernable tartness (which was why I bought them) and some sprinklings in the bottom of the bag but all very tiny.  Disappointed as I didn't buy simple, sweet cashews..could have gotten those in a larger quantity and for cheaper (and prefer the usual honey flavor of other brands to this vanilla).  I wasn't impressed. (I bought mine at a local grocery store and they were fresh.)

If you like cashews definitely give these a try!

review/summary: gives me heartburn
review/text: I love nuts and almonds among my favorites. When I saw the description of Sahale almonds I was so excited to try it. All the ingredients looked just delicious so I've got a subscription on it. Unfortunately now, when I got my first batch of them and tried, I have to cancel it. Every time I eat them I have a heartburn. Not sure what exactly causes it because I'm fine with pure almonds, sea salt (at least with the one I have at home), honey, cranberries, no known food allergies. It might be salt/nuts/cranberries combination that causes it, not sure.

review/text: These are perfect - crunchy, only slightly sweet, a bit salty, and with some variation in the mix, but not so much as a trail mix with too much fruit or sugar. These are the same sold at Starbucks, which is where I first found them. YUM!! And made w/ wind power and nutritionally sound (check their website - how they make the products).

It almost held be back from buying these, but they are nothing like that. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to sample them before buying, otherwise I never would have.  They are the perfect amount of sweetness with real fruit pieces that taste like fruit and vanilla!  I would highly recommend these to everyone. Very filling too, unlike most snacks.  You only need to eat a few pieces and you don't feel icky after eating them.

review/summary: Great snack!!
review/text: I actually got some of this as a gift myself and was instantly addicted.  I am also amazed to have seen a review saying it was hot.. I don't know what that guy was eating but it was NOT this product.  It is not hot and all (and not spicy).  Soon to try it as a salad topping.  It is really nice to finally find some snacks that are satisfying, tasty and nutritious as well.  Heck...I'd eat the stuff even it wasn't nutritious... it's that good!!

review/text: All of the Sahale Blends of dried fruit, spice and nuts are great, but Valdosta is my favorite. It is  an all-natural product that combine sweet and savory into one delicious package with a great combination of pecans, cranberries, pepper and orange zest.  The pouch is easy to open and close, making it a great choice for quick on-the-road snacking.

review/summary: Quick and easy recipe - low in sodium and fat!
review/text: I had been searching for recipes for my mother-in-law who is on a sodium and fat restricted diet for congestive heart failure. I spent hours on the internet and was successful at a few recipes but really needed something quick. I found the Concord Foods Cranberry Bread mix in my grocers produce department and was thrilled to see the sodium and fat amounts fell within my mother-in-laws diet restrictions. I had to subsitute dried dates for the cranberries because they are not allowed on her diet and was pleasantly surprised at the results. The bread was light and moist and full of flavor with only 125mg of sodium and 1.5g of fat.<br /><br />My mother-in-law loves the bread. I've made it as muffins so she can freeze them and take them out as needed. Our only disappointment is that this is a seasonal item. I stocked up with a few boxes of the mix and I will look for it again next spring.

review/summary: Cheap coffee with cheap flavoring
review/text: Somehow the marketing giants successfully sold flavored coffee as 'gourmet', though there's nothing gourmet about artificial vanilla flavoring.  The best part for coffee vendors is that they can sell inferior quality beans because the vanilla flavoring will cover it up.  If you actually enjoy the taste of coffee, then get real gourmet beans -- 100% arabica beans that have been roasted in the last couple weeks if not days-- not the cheap stuff that is covered with a sickly sweet flavoring to cover up the burnt rubber tase.  If you like this type of flavored coffee, then save yourself some money and buy a big, cheap can of folgers and a bottle of vanilla syrup.  At least that way the vanilla flavoring won't linger in your coffee machine.

review/summary: Excellent coffee.  A Winner!
review/text: I was given the opportunity to review this product.  I believe I am  qualified because believe it or not, I not only like coffee, but even more astonishingly, I actually drink coffee all the time.  And I really love flavored coffee, especially hazelnut coffee.  All the better and kind of making me a sucker for a good, hazelnut flavored coffee.<br /><br />So, what was this coffee like?  I brewed it using an automatic coffee maker.  It comes in a vaccum packed in a 11 ounce package.  Although I was only given a single package, it is supposed to come in a 3 pack in a retail package.<br /><br />First, the smell of the ground coffee was very, very aromatic and nice.  It is ground to extra-fine grade.<br /><br />As far as the drinking experience, I was highly pleased.  The brew is very smooth and full, with a tremendous full flavor.  The taste is without bitterness at all.  And I found no aftertaste as the acidity seems non-existent.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this coffee (in fact, I am drinking a cup right now!).  I will certainly be buying this product in the future.  Awesome product!

review/summary: A Winning Flavored Coffee
review/text: I am a medium to heavy coffee drinker.  I've noticed most of the heavy coffee drinkers I know do not care for "flavored" coffees and I must say I've had more I poured out that drank down.  That is not to say that I've not enjoyed flavored coffee when the combination of good flavor and correct strength of that flavor blend with a nice roast.  As it turns out that is exactly the case here.  If I'm going to drink flavored coffee this Melitta Cafe Collection Creme Brulee is a definate winner.<br /><br />The Melitta Cafe Collection Creme Brulee is medium to fine grind in coarseness.  I have used coffee with this consistency in my expresso machine, but the review here will be as prepared with a regular drip type maker.  Upon opening first thing you will notice is a very glorious creamy hazelnut smell with a nice earthy roasted coffee bean underpinning...Honestly, it smelled like a wonderful desert and as it brewed it filled the kitchen as good as any of the scented candles my wife is so fond of.  This coffee starts giving pleasure from the moment it's opened whetting your taste buds for what is to come!  Speaking of the roasted coffee itself, this is a medium roast as it is rich but not as deep as many of the dark roasts.  It is an excellent roast as the coffee is strong enough not to get lost with the other flavors, but important to me it is pretty full tasting for a medium roast yet is never the least bit bitter tasting...Excellent roasted ground beans.  Now, we're talking about flavored coffee so we must address that component, this is where I'm happy to say I am surprised.  While the hazelnut is not timid it truly strikes what to this coffee drinker is a happy balance.  It tastes just as good as the smells it elicits.  Truthfully, I'm not hung-up that it says it has artificial flavors...I only care if it tastes good and it most certainly is hazelnut with light vanilla cream taste on a really nice coffee base - eminently drinkable and very enjoyable.  If you like flavored coffee done right then this Melitta Cafe Collection flavor should be on your menu, it really is flavored coffee that even a snob purist coffee drinker could happily drink.  I will still drink more regular roasted coffee, but when I want a change for a treat this stuff will be my "go-to" choice.

review/summary: Not bad, but not what I had hoped for....
review/text: I love coffee..........  I drink it daily and avoid instant, favoring mostly freshly ground beans that I grind myself.  I lean towards French and Espresso Roast and Pike Place Market, all three made by a little company up in Seattle.  After reading the product description for Melitta Cafe Collection/Hazelnut Creme Brulee ground coffee , I had envisioned something like the sweetened Nestle's Tasters choice or something like that.  Ok, I knew this was ground coffee and not instant, but I am talking about the flavor aspect.<br /><br />I use a 2 cup drip coffee maker with a filter.  I followed the directions, adding 2 Teaspoons for each 6 ounces of coffee I wanted to make.  I went with 18 ounces worth which would be 6 teaspoons.  I like my coffee a bit strong so i added an extra teaspoon.  The coffee started to drip and my kitchen started smelling very nice which gave me high hopes for a very nice cup of coffee.<br /><br /> I drink my coffee with just a dash of milk and no sugar, so I did the same with the Creme Brulee.......  What I smelled and what I tasted didn't quite match up.  The taste? In a word , "Artificial" ........... While the coffee itself seemed fresh enough, albeit a bit weak in the caffeine area, the 'flavor' was not what I had hoped for...  While not a bad tasting coffee, my main complain would have to be a strange aftertaste that I just do NOT wish to taste first thing in the morning, or any other time for that matter.  Your mileage may vary, but for me I think I will just stick with my plain, unadulterated freshly ground beans from that little company up in Seattle.

review/summary: Great aroma and nice flavor
review/text: I'll give this coffee 4.5 stars, but rounded up to five since there is no 4.5 option.  When you first open the bag, you'll notice a really terrific aroma.  Yum.<br /><br />They're calling this an extra fine grind.  I'd probably call it a fine grind, but it was fine enough for my espresso machine to handle it without a problem.  The Arabica beans are a medium roast.  Not too dark and not too light.  The coffee seemed to be quite fresh.  Caffeine content seemed moderate, although I haven't exactly done any lab testing.<br /><br />Once brewed, the hazelnut coffee aroma fills the kitchen and smells just as good as when you first opened the bag.  The taste of it is also quite good.  I've had some other flavored coffees, Gevalia comes to mind, that I thought were lousy.  In fact, I threw the Gevalia in the garbage can due to its strong artificial flavor.  But I think this is pretty decent stuff and I'll definitely use the entire bag.<br /><br />They call this coffee "Hazelnut Creme Brulee", but it tastes nothing like Creme Brulee to me.  So while the Creme Brulee tag sounds nice, it probably doesn't mean much.  However, the hazelnut flavor is enjoyable and well pronounced but not overpowering.<br /><br />It's very good flavored coffee, in my view.  Again, I'd rate it somewhere between 4 and 5 stars according to my tastes.  I think you'll enjoy it as long as you like flavored coffees.  The fact that it's ground finely enough to use in an espresso machine is an additional plus.

review/text: This coffee is so delicious tasting, and oh my goodness, the aroma that percolates from your coffee pot is so enticing!!! Normally I'm not crazy about plain hazelnut because it can smell sort of acrid. But this coffee with the combination of hazelnut and the Creme Brulee flavoring is so delicously creamy, no sharp or bitter flavors at all. It's not an everyday coffee for us, we normally save it for weekends or holidays, but it sure is a crowd pleaser.

review/summary: Not up to par for this company
review/text: I love Melitta products. Even use the now almost antique ceramic coffee cone to brew cups individually (they're better brewed that way).  I also admit to being a coffee snob and someone who is qualified to judge the flavor and worth of a brewed cup of "the nectar of the gods."  So I had high hopes for Melitta's newest caf&eacute; Collection Hazelnut Creme Brulee.<br /><br />Alas, I was sorely disappointed.  Not only did this coffee not deliver on flavor, it actually has a chemically artificial taste.  I normally use three heaping measures (special pewter Melitta coffee measure) for a 10-12 oz. cup, because I prefer a full-flavor brew.  This cup fell far short of the mark.  In addition to not delivering on hazelnut creme brulee flavor, it also did not deliver on coffee flavor.  It was weak, despite the strength of multiple scoops, imparted an artificial flavor devoid of richness one would expect.<br /><br />Perhaps I am jaded because once I found the perfect whole bean product, I have consistently returned to said product after forays into other brands and have chosen the same superior coffee for eleven years.<br /><br />I searched Melitta's website for a list of ingredients and caloric content but found nothing other than instructions for brewing which will result in weak, insipid "see-through" coffee.<br /><br />I am sad to give a less than stellar report, however, search further.  There are better brews on the market and certainly better flavored brews.

review/summary: Not the Flavored Coffee I Had in Mind
review/text: Years ago, I purchased a hazelnut-flavored coffee that really pleased me, but the company that made it changed their formula to a flavor that tasted like alcohol with a little flavoring added.  Since then I've been hoping to find another hazelnut coffee as good as the old variety.<br /><br />Melita doesn't make it. In all fairness, it's just as good as the ones (only two) I can buy at my local grocery, but it's not better.  There is a faint flavor of hazelnut, but, for me, the taste that shouldn't be there (alcohol or something chemical) overwhelms the hazelnut.<br /><br />Will I buy it again?  No.  I'll stick with my regular breakfast blend and add hazelnut liquor or good Irish Cream when I want a really satisfying flavored coffee. With a little whipped cream on top!

I ended up using a pair of scissors to get it open and a clip to keep it closed.<br /><br />The second most noticeable thing about this coffee is just how pronounced the flavor of hazelnut creme brulee was as I drank it. This is strong stuff for a flavored coffee. Normally, flavored coffees' flavor are more subtle, but not this coffee. Personally, I found the flavor too intense, but I know other people will appreciate the flavor being strong.

review/summary: HazelsButt flavor is enough, adding brulee to that is sicklysweet
review/text: Being that I am not a lover of HazelsButt flavor to begin with, and to combine that with a rich cr&egrave;me, vanilla flavor, carmelized sugar, brulee didn't fit well with my taste buds.  And as for a fancy gourmet coffee drinker, I am not.  This is a European coffee flavor made from the more expensive Acabica beans.<br /><br />I like my coffee hot and use a Farberware coffee percolator, and have use average amount of cream, but with no sugar.  Therefore, I do not want the rich caramel and vanilla flavor since it is sweet.  This coffee has a very strong sweet smell, and it permeates, to me, a sickly sweet aroma.<br /><br />I tried several cups and used almost the same amount of coffee that my regular coffee takes.  This is a much finer ground of coffee was turned off by the smell each time I drank a cup.<br /><br />This coffee is great for those who love gourmet coffee, and I don't mind gourmet coffee, but just couldn't get past the sicklysweetsmell.  .....Rizzo

review/text: I am not a coffee drinker, I have a few cups once in a while but I have never been a true fan of the taste. I always find it bitter now matter the flavor or how much sugar is added. But I have to admit, I really enjoyed the Hazelnut Creme Brulee flavor. It wasn't overpowering, in fact, I wouldn't even say it was a truly sharp hazelnut taste. It didin't have a bitter aftertaste that I was expecting from something that I already found bitter. The flavoring is very subtle and smooth. It won't make me a coffee drinker, but I would reach for this first if/when I hanker for a cup (yes, I just used the word "hanker").

review/summary: Tastes good with no fake chemical-y after-taste!!!
review/text: I love coffee and I like the IDEA of some flavored coffees, but oftentimes the actual flavored coffee has an awful after-taste, like some horrific, cancer-inducing chemical has been used. That is not the case with Melitta Cafe's Hazelnut Creme Brulee coffee. This is good stuff! The flavor is light, not overbearing, and the coffee is high quality. Huzzah!

review/summary: Office Grade Coffee
review/text: I am a fairly big coffee drinker that brews my own pot of coffee pretty much every morning and then after lunch will buy a cup at a either SB, Pete's, or if I am lucky enough to be around a Blue Bottle seller.  I admit that in a pinch, I will drink some of the sludge we have in the office (caffeine addiction is sad thing).  I pretty much always brew/order the "bolder" coffees.  My favorite being Sumatra.  No milk, creamer, sugar, or anything else that would get in the way of the flavor of coffee.  That is how I have been drinking this hazelnut flavored coffee the past week.  The first thing you notice even before you brew the first cup is that the hazelnut is not real hazelnut.  The front of the package very clearly (which is kind of odd but, commendable in terms of full disclosure) states the flavoring is artificial.  Really, fake nuts?  Come on.  Well, after brewing several pots I have to say that this stuff is just not very good, artificial flavored or not.  There is a hazelnut taste and smell but, it really does smell and taste oddly off.  The taste is somewhat cardboard like with a sort of metallic finish.  I know it isn't my coffee making equipment since I am using the same stuff I normally brew.  It's not bitter and has pretty low acidity.  I tried mixing the grounds with half of my usual coffee and it pretty much just tainted my regular coffee.  I have had hazelnut flavored coffees from other producers and although I was not a fan of the flavoring they didn't have these off tastes.  Maybe the flavored coffees just aren't for me.  I equate this stuff to office brew.  It'll work in a pinch but not something I would buy.

review/summary: Wonderful aroma, but bitter
review/text: I really, really wanted to enjoy this coffee; hazelnut Cr&egrave;me br�l&eacute;e Delish! I absolutely love coffee and this has several things in its favor:<br /><br />*aroma<br />*quality packaging: This comes in a plastic bag with reclosing strap, but you'll still want to store the bag in an airtight container.<br />*ground fine: This is for richer flavor. The best brands do this.<br />*image: If you delight in coffee and want to think of other parts of the world as you sip it, this company really shoots for that image.<br />*Reasonable price.<br /><br />The aroma is probably the best part. It's a tradition for my husband and me to open fresh coffee together, and while he's never been a fan of flavored coffee, he says this one's "Not bad." He likes a coffee that gets his attention. Bitter coffee earns his respect. But the bottom line is, this coffee is very bitter and leaves an aftertaste. Now, is that bitterness from the bean itself, or from the flavoring? I'd need to try the regular and get a comparison to answer that for you.<br /><br />That said, the bitterness came as a bit of a surprise to me because the beans are grown at a higher elevation and the package states that the beans are never bitter. The higher elevation reduces the acidity in coffee and therefore the bitterness. So when you brew a cup and it turns out it is bitter...the image doesn't take that away or allow people to ignore it; rather, it lifts expectations only to disappoint.<br /><br />But elevation isn't the only issue. It also matters what kind of beans these are. Are these Arabica beans? Those are the good stuff-the ones you really want to buy because of their lack of bitterness. Grow them high-sure-but the bean still matters. So, whether or not these are Arabica, I don't know: I couldn't find the ingredients list on the package and it doesn't say elsewhere.<br /><br />So, all told, I really wanted to enjoy the creative cr&egrave;me brul&eacute;e flavor since I love hazelnut cr&egrave;me brul&eacute;e and coffee, too-but the bitterness gets in the way. Reasonable price, though.

review/summary: Wonderfully complex, slight bitter finish
review/text: Melitta Hazelnut Cr&egrave;me Brulee<br /><br />Wonderfully complex, slight bitter finish<br /><br />I am about half way through the 11oz bag, and am still experimenting with the optimum proportions. Mind you I have found the flavor so far to be wonderfully complex. Perhaps out of all of the coffee flavors, the only ones that I find as complementing the natural taste of coffee are those of hazelnut and French vanilla. I ordinarily like the natural plain taste of coffee and have progressed from the instant, to the drip and occasionally dabble in grinding my own. The flavored coffees generally overdo the flavor, in this beverage category a "hint" of flavor is generally more than enough. Enough of the background, here are the specific comments that may help you to decide whether this one is worth trying.<br /><br />The big positive is that the flavor mix of hazelnut and cr&egrave;me brulee works very well together. The cr&egrave;me brulee part is a wonderful caramelized sugar and butterscotch aroma that underlies the hazelnut foundation. Like in a fine wine, this adds complexity to the brew, which makes you savor and swirl the concoction in your mouth to prolong the taste sensations. There is actually a hint of whiskey liquor as well, perhaps stemming from the vanilla and oak connection I often notice in wine. The brewing aroma is great and it permeates the house, a great wake up alarm. That is the good part, there is a slight downer as well, there is a slight lingering bitter finish on the back of the throat. Use extra milk or half and half to tame it.<br /><br />I noticed there is a bit of discussion regarding as to whether this coffee is weak or strong. I think I have an answer that may be consistent with all the observations. If you prepare it according to the measurements that you may be used to (say the standard measuring cup provided with majority of ground coffee cups), you will find it weak. If you prepare it to the directions on the bag, two teaspoons per 6oz cup, you will likely find it strong. So use more than you would normally but less than the directions say.<br /><br />Also pay attention to the "extra fine grind" on the package. They mean it. If you coffee maker has a setting for 2-4 coups vs a full pot, then use it. This setting slows down the rate at which water goes through the grounds, and you may need that with this coffee. It is such a fine grind that it tends to plug up the pores of the filter. Wwith a fast water flow, the filter may flow over.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this is a wonderful flavor combination, still a bit heavy handed, so go ahead and blend it with your regular coffee 50-50, and still get the special occasion/desert feeling.

review/summary: I've had better......
review/text: I got my package in the mail today & see that it's extra fine grind so I can't use it in my coffee press. No problem as I plugged in a 4 cup coffeepot to make my first brew. What I would up with was a milder form of coffee than the bold & extra bold coffee's which is more like Breakfast Blend from that well known Seattle company. Tried my first sip black & it was ok, thankfully not bitter. Added the usual 2 spoons of suger & it tasted better but it won't be something I'll buy as it's too mild for my tastes even though I used the same amount of coffee as I always do when I made this 4 cup potfull. Couldn't taste any Hazelnut flavoring in the coffee even in that first black sip before I added sugar. All I can say (on my sencond cup as I'm writing this review) is that it's a light coffee with some body to it & that there are no unpleasant aftertaste flavors. It does seem to be weaker in the caffeine department than what I'm used to drinking but some people might like that. All in all I'll finish the bag but as I've said before I'm not going to buy this coffee for myself.<br /><br />I also couldn't get the bag open & had to cut below the seal in order to get at the coffee then I had to pour it into a coffee can I happened to have in my pantry which means I couldn't use the bag that the coffee came in as there was no way to seal the bag up after I had cut it open. So you might want to have an 11.5 oz or larger coffee can with it's lid if you order this coffee from Amazon.

review/summary: Survey says: Delicious!
review/text: Although I am a "one cup a day" coffee drinker, I have a slight allergy to hazelnuts, so I put this coffee next to the coffee maker in our break room with a sign that said, drink up and tell me what you think. Here's what the committee came back with:<br /><br />J: It was really good. Very smooth and the hazelnut flavor was delicious. I like hazelnut coffee and drink it all the time and this was the best I've had.<br />M: That coffee was very good. Me and the girls were talking and we want to have it on a regular basis. When are you going to get us some more?<br />E: It smelled great while brewing and tasted excellent. The coffee and hazelnut flavors complement each other and make a great cup of coffee.<br />H: I liked it. D had a cup and said, I never drink more than one cup of coffee in the morning, but just before lunch, I caught a whiff of that aroma and had to have another. It's wonderful!<br /><br />So, I think the public has spoken and this is a tasty, well received brand of coffee. Three of the four respondents also asked: Where did you get it? This is definitely the most popular flavor and brand of coffee in our company in the last four or five years.

review/summary: Measures up well to my favorite Green Mountain coffee
review/text: I have been drinking Melitta's Hazelnut Creme Brulee ground coffee for a bout a week.  I find it pleasant, complex, and fills the kitchen with a very pleasant smell.<br /><br />The grounds have very fine grind, however I had no issues with it plugging up the filter. I have been experimenting with the amount of grounds I use for each cup, and I found that I like a heaving measuring cup.  So a little more than I use for my favorite Green Mountain Hazelnut coffee.<br />If I use less the coffee is a little weaker than I like, if I follow the instructions on the package (2 teaspoons per 6 oz cup) I find it a little too strong.  I would recommend experimenting to find just the right strength for your own taste.<br /><br />I love flavored coffees and Melitta measures up well to my favorite Green Mountain coffee, while being less expensive.  I will be ordering it again in the future.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Where's the romance?
review/text: "A European classic. Sweet caramel and rich vanilla infused with the flavor of wild hazelnuts." - from the package of Melitta's HAZELNUT CR&Egrave;ME BRULEE coffee<br /><br />"... Melitta brings to life the feelings of the most romantic European Caf&eacute;s." - from the package of Melitta's HAZELNUT CR&Egrave;ME BRULEE coffee<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />There were logistical problems getting this review written. My wife brewed-up and quaffed down the entire original package without giving me the opportunity to sample. She likes her cuppa Joe in the morning, while I drink the stuff only on those occasions when I want something "different." In our house, it's apparently "every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost."<br /><br />So, she opened up a fresh package of HAZELNUT CR&Egrave;ME BRULEE this morning under my close surveillance.<br /><br />Granted, my wife is more attuned to a coffee's subtleties than I am. But we both agree that this blend presents neither the nuanced aroma nor flavor of anything containing caramel, vanilla, or hazelnuts. It's a decent coffee inasmuch as it's not bitter, but that's all it is - simply coffee-flavored coffee, which brings to life the romance of any ordinary brew station anywhere in the world, e.g. the customer waiting room of Bob's A-1 Auto Repair and Tires down on the corner.<br /><br />And do "wild hazelnuts" taste any different than the cultivated variety?

review/summary: Great Hazelnut Aroma but Strong and Bitter Taste
review/text: When you first open this bag of coffee you are met with a wonderful hazelnut aroma with a slight hint of caramel. Upon brewing my first cup I noticed that the aroma intensified a bit and had more of a coffee overtone and less of the previous hazelnut and caramel..  Unfortunately the taste was a bit strong and bitter.  It was almost like having strong dark bitter coffee with some hazelnut coffeemate to tone it down.  The second cup was made by brewing a bit lighter and the taste became much more smooth and pleasant.  There is still a slightly bitter undertone but a little bit of milk smooths things out very nicely.  Overall this is a strong and bitter coffee with a hazelnut flavor so make sure this suits your taste or you like your coffee with dash of milk.<br /><br />*** Positive Points: ***<br /><br />- Great hazelnut aroma<br />- Pleasant taste once adjusted for bitterness<br /><br />*** Negative Points: ***<br /><br />- Strong and somewhat bitter taste<br />- Rather expensive

review/summary: Intense Flavored Coffee
review/text: I've tried various flavored coffees from different companies and the 'Melitta Cafe Collection Hazelnut Creme Brulee' has to be one of my least favorites.<br /><br />My primary problem with this coffee is that the flavoring is so pronounced that it drowns out the coffee taste and completely overwhelms with Hazelnut and Creme Brulee. In my opinion the flavoring should be subtle and compliment the coffee. Not the case with this coffee at all. The aroma when brewing this coffee is superb but one taste and I was immediately not a fan.<br /><br />Also, this coffee comes packed in the bag equivalent of a plastic clamshell container. In other words the package impossible to open without scissors which defeats the purpose of the resealable bag.

Sweet, chocolaty, very welcoming.<br /><br />However, don't think this is not coffee or will taste like some sort of latte. The coffee is strong, and the flavor is mainly what you will expect, coffee with a hint of hazelnut. It might be sweeter than regular ground coffee, but it's by no means sweet in flavor - again, it's real coffee.<br /><br />Everyone in the house liked it, and really enjoy the smell of it.<br /><br />There is really nothing bad to say about this coffee - it's an interesting (in a good way!) flavor, with a wonderful dessert-like smell that makes the entire household crave a drink.

But Melitta has not been a great company that produces the best coffee filters, but they've also got some really strong coffee flavors to call their own. That comes with their cafe collection, and their Hazelnut Creme Brulee. The taste is absolutely very smooth and mild to the taste buds, yet remain sophisticated and strong from the first time you simply whiff the smell and aroma. I absolutely loved the taste of it from the very first sip. I absolutely recommend this as another delightful flavor in your morning cup of joy in the morning. Melitta does do their best, and they still know how to delight anyone with coffee.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+

Over the next few days, I brewed it again and I was left with the same impression - it just tasted artificial to me.  I served it to my brother with no pre-discussion and he didn't really go for it either - so it wasn't just me.  I would have to say pass on this one.

It made me wish for "frustration-free" packaging, or at least a pair of gloves to protect my hands from the very sharp foil edges left when I finally had to resort to scissors.

Still it's better then the free stuff I get at work - I would buy the Blanc et Noir before purchasing this flavor.  Maybe I just don't care for Hazlenut or something.  There wasn't anything wrong with it, and I'm sure there will be many who adore this coffee.  I simply preferred the other flavor.  The coffee is pre-ground and very fine, almost (but not quite) to the level of espresso.  Now even though I preferred the other flavor, this was good enough for me to finish the whole bag no problem.  Several of my friends actually preferred this to the other.<br /><br />The packaging however - remains the same - you need to find a greek god to simply pull the package open or you need to go at it with a pair of scissors.  True, you don't have to worry about any of the grounds escaping before you open it... but trust me, just use the scissors.<br /><br />Final opinion - 3 for the flavor 2 for the packaging.  I am sure there are many who will consider this a 5 star coffee and you may well be one of them.  If you like Hazelnut then this is probably right up your alley as the hazelnut overpowers the creme brulee flavoring.

review/summary: A pleasant surprise
review/text: When I got to try Melitta's Hazelnut Creme Brulee coffee I wasn't expecting much. Any "flavored" coffee I had ever tried had been overpowering. I'm a big coffee fan, and like flavors like hazelnut or french vanilla from time to time, but usually via creamer so I can control the strength. With Melitta's coffee, I was pleasantly surprised on two counts.<br /><br />First, the flavors were not overpowering - that's a refreshing change! In fact, the hazelnut and creme brulee worked surprisingly well together. It definitely had a unique and complex taste that was more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Second, the taste of the coffee was really quite nice. (This was less of a surprise as I've been pleased with Melitta's regular coffee products.) Once prepared the coffee was really very smooth, flavorful, and lacking in bitterness. I brewed it three different strengths before posting this review. At 'medium' strength (2 tablespoons per 10-12oz coffee mug) the coffee was very good, smooth and flavors well blended, and no bitterness at all. At a weaker strength (as my spouse would make it) the flavors still come through but as you would expect the coffee flavor is off. At recommended strength (2 tablespoons per hypothetical 6oz cup) the taste was also very good - the coffee taste excellent, the flavors slightly on the heavy side (especially the creme brulee) and just a hint of bitterness that one would expect with strong coffee. In an office environment where the strength depends on who brews the pot that day, tasting good at any strength is a definite plus.<br /><br />The only (minor) downside at all was the packaging. It was ridiculously hard to open the package. I appreciate the strong seal for the sake of freshness, but I also like to be able to open a coffee bag :)<br /><br />If you're a coffee purist who has never liked flavored coffees, this one will not change your mind. But if you do like flavored coffee and have shied away from prepackaged flavor coffee because the taste has been overpowering, you should definitely consider trying Melitta's flavored coffee.

It is strong, too, in the sense that it delivers a full caffeine load despite tasting 'light.'<br />The problem I have with it is that the coffee itself is infused with so much artificial flavoring that it leaves a metallic, saccharine aftertaste that lingers, actually dwells, in one's mouth for long after the drink is consumed.<br />This would taste better if there were just a bit less flavoring in it, I think.<br />Brewed using Melitta's own single cup system with melitta filters.<br />This is not something that I would drink regularly but is interesting although not particularly satisfying as a novelty.

review/summary: Lovely coffee
review/text: I really like this coffee, although I have always been a fan of flavored coffees.  What I liked about this coffee is that it is not too strong, not too bitter, and doesnt come with an aftertaste.  So many times flavored coffees do have a kind of pungent aftertaste  I used to think I made the coffee too strong but it would persist no matter how weak I made the coffee  I am not sure if they have used a different process in creating the hazelnut cream flavor than other coffee makers, but they really nailed this one.

review/summary: Tastes good.
review/text: I am no expert when it comes to coffee and of course everyone has their own preference as far as strength and tastes go, but I really enjoyed this coffee. I typically do not like flavored coffees or creams, but the hazelnut is very mild and does not overpower the coffee. My wife enjoys it and the price is very fair. Also I like the smaller size of the bags because they wont sit around for a long time losing flavor and freshness.

review/summary: decent coffee, impossible packaging
review/text: This is a decent ground coffee with a mild hazelnut flavor.  I would give it a good solid four stars.  What I did not appreciate was the difficult packaging; I believe in freshness too, but this took me a long, frustrating time to get into -- yikes!!

review/summary: Great coffee................
review/text: My husband loves coffee and he found this product to be very good. The first thing he notice when he opened the  package is the wonderful rich coffee smell, and yes it tastes as good as it smells. He uses 7 1/2 to 8 scoops for a 12 cup pot since he like his coffee a little on the stronger side. He stated that this coffee is low on acidity, plus he has tried the Gevalia coffees, they taste good, but were too acid for people with a sensitive stomach. Once you open the can, store it in the freezer, take it out only when you need to make a pot of coffee, then put it back in the freezer and the coffee will stay almost as fresh as the day you opened the package.<br /><br />Though I am more of a tea drinker, I do have my share of coffee. I personally enjoy the Hazelnut features a delicate aroma. A flavor like this is perfect dessert coffee; it is a sweet reward anytime. Vanilla Almond is another flavored coffee I enjoy time to time also.<br /><br />Overall, it's a consistent, smooth, delicious coffee. It does not bite back at you and it doesn't "challenge" your palate. It stands alone (black) and holds its own when mixed with milk and sugar. If I HAD to present a criticism, it might be that the ground stuff is sort of fine which does not make it compatible with certain types of coffee makers. For us, it works wonderfully with my good old Mr. Coffee.

review/summary: Only Ok
review/text: Not much to say about the Melitta Cafe Collection Hazelnut Creme Brulee coffee.  The coffee itself was decent enough, although I thought the hazlenut flavor was a tad strong.  It wasn't the best coffee I've ever had but was decent enough for an everyday brew. That being said, I wouldn't pay $20 for this product again since I consider it no better than average.

review/text: Hazelnut Creme Brulee is tasty, especially as an add-on to enhance the flavor of regular coffee.  I am a big fan of flavored coffee, but my husband prefers plain coffee.  However, he really enjoys this when blended with regular coffee.

review/summary: Excellent Brew (A Grade)
review/text: Being a very picky coffee drinker, I can say Melitta is one of the best coffees on the market. It's rich, strong and very tasty. There is no after taste and very flavorful. If you enjoy Maxwell House or Chock Full O Nuts, I recommend you try the Melitta brand. The Hazelnut Creme Brulee flavor gives it a nice kick. A near perfect coffee.<br /><br />Katiebabs

review/summary: Decent flavored coffee if you like that sort of thing
review/text: Melitta Hazelnut Creme Brulee is a decent coffee, but not a great coffee. I like coffee that is a bit stronger, fuller and smells like full roast coffee. This coffee actually does smell like vanilla, cream and hazelnuts with a hint of caramel. It smells like a specialty coffee drink at Starbucks or better. The issue I have is that the taste doesn't live up the smell. It tastes like a pretty normal medium roast coffee. That is not to say it's bad. I will finish off the pack, but will probably use most of it for company that prefers this sort of thing.<br /><br />For my own personal taste, I like full roast coffees, black with no sugar. Peet's French Roast (yes, I know it is sorta "burnt" to some of you). What I really, really like are artisan roasted beans from small shops or from Italy and France. One of my favorites is Castroni, from Rome. This is all to say that this coffee is drinkable, but if not for the Amazon Vine review process, I would not have bought it myself.<br /><br />For a better cuppa from Melitta, try the "Blanc et Noir" which is somewhere between medium and full roast. Very smooth and satisfying and you can share it with those who like somewhat less than full-on strong coffee.

review/summary: Hazelnut Creme Brulee Coffee- What's Not To Love?
review/text: Let me start by saying I'm not really a coffee connoisseur or a coffee snob.  I'm not difficult to impress when it comes to coffee, but with that being said, I have my definite likes and dislikes.  I dislike coffee that features anemic flavor, for instance, or coffee that has to be disguised with cream and sugar just to be palatable.<br /><br />Hooray that the Melitta Cafe Collection Hazelnut Creme Brulee Ground Coffee has a good balance of being strong enough to stand up to a little cream and sugar, but not so overpowering that I feel like in drinking it, I'm putting hair on my chest as well as on my teeth.  The hazelnut creme brulee flavor comes out a little more, in my opinion, when there's a little sugar and cream (or skim milk or any dairy variation in between the two extremes)added, but I wasn't overwhelmed, drinking this coffee black, either.<br /><br />I tried brewing it using the Coffee Duck for my Senseo single-cup coffeemaker, and it worked quite well- in fact, as I don't own a bigger coffeemaker, this is my preferred means of making coffee.  I also tried it in my French press, but two things worked against me there- first, I'm just not that skilled yet with the French press, and second, I think the grind might be just a little too fine for French pressing.  It still tasted quite good, but was silty.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really pleased with the flavor of the Melitta Cafe Collection Hazelnut Creme Brulee coffee.  If you like flavored coffee, give it a try!

review/summary: Starts like a candle, ends like a flavoring for my excess of sugar and milk
review/text: First off, it had a strange scent when I opened the bag.  Something fake, but not even dessert like.  More like a Yankee Candle, wax and all.  I decided to try it anyway.  I was very careful with the brew, since I have read other reviews. I got it to only have a slightly bitter aftertaste by stopping brewing a few minutes early.  I am thinking the fine grade makes it hard to brew, where whole beans would be better.  After weighing it down a bit with sugar and milk, it's ok.  Not horrible, not great, ok.  I've heard good things about this company, but wouldn't buy any other coffees from them if they are like this.

review/summary: Superb Aroma and Flavor
review/text: I have to limit my caffeine consumption. Because I can't drink very much coffee I want the coffee I drink to be absolutely superb. A large part of my whole coffee experience is enjoying the aroma of coffee as it brews and as I inhale the steam from my cup.<br /><br />The extra fine grind of the MELITTA HAZELNUT CREME BRULEE package meant that I could use less than half the recommended amount of coffee and get a robust, strong brew. The flavor was so smooth I did not need sugar or sweetener to enhance it. I love the way this coffee smells. As I sit writing this review, I smell the wonderful aroma wafting from the kitchen and take small sips of the coffee from a mug that was a gift from a friend. This is civilization and comfort of the highest order.<br /><br />I love cream brulee. This is a great coffee that can be substituted instead of dessert, or with dessert if you must. I recommend using real cream or milk in it rather than non-dairy coffee creamer. I also recommend this coffee for breakfast as a companion to cinnamon rolls, cereal or pancakes with real maple syrup. It's great iced and would make a wonderful flavoring for homemade ice cream or milk shakes.

review/summary: Bitter, artificial and just plain awful
review/text: Bleech.<br /><br />That's how I'd describe this coffee.  To be fair, I'm one of those purists that grind their own beans and shy away from artificial flavors.  However, I'm open minded and gave this a try.  For a treat sometimes, a flavored coffee can curb some of those urges for a sugary treat.<br /><br />Opening the back I was instantly hit with the smell.  Strong and overpowering.  The smell wasn't of coffee, it was of some air freshener you'd find in a gas station checkout.  I still decided to brew it though, so I could be fair in the review.<br /><br />I tried it via standard drip brew, toddy, aeropress and french press.  No matter what I tried, the brew came out overly bitter.  This is partially due to the extremely fine grind.  When I tried it with creamer and/or sweetener, the brew was more tolerable.  I was still tasting the artificial flavor more than coffee accents.<br /><br />If you generally like the swill most companies server in their breakrooms, then this is definitely a step up.  For those of us with a bit more refined coffee palate, take a pass on this and add your own Torani syrups to achieve the hazelnut and vanilla flavoring.
