review/summary: Great juice, but too expensive on Amazon
review/text: I bought this cherry juice from a local Harris Twitter and loved it.  It taste very fresh, clearly better than juice reconstituted from concentrate.  But it's too expensive here at Amazon!  I think I bought it for $6-7/bottle from the local store.  Was hoping to find it here cheaper but quite the opposite.  Disappointed.

review/summary: Best Juice Ever Delivered to Your Door!
review/text: This, and all the Lakewood, PURE, Organic Juices (that I have tried), are absolutely, the BEST available. Each juice tastes like the ripe fruit actually tastes, but you can stock up on it! Think of having a case of this juice in a natural disaster, when water may not even be available.  It is precious with nutrients AND water that comes in the juice! To have AMAZON deliver this to your door FREE is a miracle, especially for those who can't get out, or get it up the stairs if shopping at a local store. Time is valuable too, as is fuel to drive around. I NEED this juice for my health and immune system.  Thank God for AMAZON!  They have everything I look for!

review/summary: Good to mix, boosts immune system
review/text: My pediatrician sent me on an online hunt for immune boosters for my son's diet when he contracted mono at age six--specifically for this product among a few others.  After ordering it and trying it out as chocolate milk, we found we actually preferred it as a "mix-in" type of powder rather than stand alone chocolate milk.  It worked mixed with milk, but turns pretty greenish after a few minutes and that was a visual turn-off for my six year old and for me to be honest.  Mixed in with pudding, yogurt, oatmeal (Mom was a huge hit the morning I had the chocolate oatmeal a-ha moment) and to make chocolate peanut butter banana smoothies, it has become a daily staple in our home.  We also use the fruit flavored mixed with greek vanilla yogurt and smoothies--it tastes sweeter to me, and is the second favorite.  Just a heads up for Mom's who may not be aware of what these super concentrated dark veggies and berries will do upon exit...don't panic when you see the end result in the toilet as unusually dark.

review/text: I have been using this product for the last 6 months with my 20 month old toddler.  We do not use it in her milk or water because she likes drinking them but we do use this product with her plain yogurt and with her 8 grain hot cereal.  She loves it!  Chocolate yogurt and oatmeal, sweet!!  I like the added vitamins from veggies that it offers, and low sugar content! I found that if I can find this with free shipping it is about 3 dollars cheaper then what I can buy it for in the store.

review/text: I bought this looking for a healthier alternative for chocolate milk.  Unfortunately the kids don't like it at all, and I have to admit, I didn't really care for it either.  I had a hard time getting it mixed in, so it tasted grainy.  I tried mixing it in the blender for smoothies and the blender couldn't even get it mixed in.  I've been able to sneak it into pancake mix and oatmeal, just to use it up, but I won't be buying it again.  I give it 3 stars for nutritional value.

review/summary: Amazing Grass Never Disappoints
review/text: My husband and I trialed this powder as adults, and we found it quite tasty when blended into smoothies. I highly recommend it as a nutrition "booster" for smoothies, particularly for picky kids. The ingredient profile is awesome.<br /><br />There are just a few reasons why I would purchase the Berry version over this one. The chocolate has soymilk powder, and we try to keep soy consumption low (the berry version doesn't). I didn't really like the taste of the chocolate when simply added to water, it needed more. In general, we liked the flavor of the berry a bit better, and the berry version has both prebiotics and probiotics in the ingredients, but the chocolate doesn't.<br /><br />Nonetheless, if you or your child is a chocolate fan, you really can't go wrong with this awesome superfood mix!

review/summary: wish the kids would drink it
review/text: This product is great!  When mixed with milk it becomes a slightly less sweet chocolate milk.  It is hardly gritty like some other superfoods may be and you even get a hint of the berry flavor.  Unfortunately, my kids who are both over 10, will not drink it.  They take a few  sips but never want to finish it.  I've even added additional chocolate syrup but they don't care for it.  It reminds me of Ovaltine, which, when I was a kid, I didn't like as much as Quick...  great product - every kid is different so you will just have to try it and see.  Know that if the kids don't like it, an adult surely would.

review/summary: AWESOME PRODUCT!
review/text: I am a college student of health sciences and the mother to a 3 yr old toddler. I personally show very little response to "placebo effect" situations and I am a true skeptic at heart. I originally found the "kid" version of this product for my daughter while searching for something to boost her immune system. I spent hours on the computer researching the ingredients of these products. I decided to try the adult version for myself and I can honestly say that the Amazing Grass Superfood Powders have made a huge improvement in both of our lives.<br /><br /> My daughter attends daycare and with that setting comes frequent colds/flus, some serious. She spent the better part of each month with varying degrees of sickness. Since we have using the Superfood Powders (months), neither she nor I have gotten sick. We spent time with my parents who were both very ill while she and I remained in good health. Her time spent at daycare has not been reduced but she is now very rarely sick. I can only recall one time since we started using this product and her sneezing/runny nose only lasted for one day. Since no other variable in our lives has been changed, I can only attribute this to the use of Amazing Grass.<br /><br /> It is difficult to make sure that a child is getting all of the necessary nutrients they need in their diet. Amazing Grass takes care of that. I feel better knowing that when my daughter goes through her "picky eating" stages, she is still getting the vitamins and nutrients her body needs to stay healthy. I mix 1 scoop of her powder with approx 8oz of milk and 1 tsp Ovaltine...I have never had any trouble getting her to drink it. She asks for her "choco milk" at least twice per day!<br /><br />Overall, EXCELLENT product! I am getting ready to purchase my 4th jar!

review/summary: I love this.. I just wish my daughter did!
review/text: I originally bought this for my 3 year old who is very picky about textures in her food/drinks and will go days without eating anything but milk. When I found this I thought it would be great because she loves chocolate milk and this is highly nutritious so I ordered it. When I made a cup of this with milk it seemed like it needed more chocolate flavor so I added ovaltine and it was delicious. So I hid it in a sippy cup so she wouldn't see the tiny green particles floating on top and I didn't tell her anything was different about it but as soon as she started drinking it she started gagging and cried "I don't like this seedy chocolate milk!"<br /><br />Not wanting to waste it my husband and I have been drinking it. We have both noticed that when we drink it we feel really good all day! So if your child doesn't have a problem with textures then I think this product would be great for you!

review/summary: Great tasting it is not, but come on, it's a bunch of vegetables
review/text: I'm really surprised by the number of people who think this makes a great tasting drink.  I'm also surprised by the number of people who think this resembles anything close to chocolate milk.  Yuck!  That being said, I think it's a GREAT product (assuming that it does contain the nutrients it claims to).  I have a 6 year old son and a 3 year old daughter.  They aren't fans of drinking this stuff in milk straight up (I've tried to drink it and can't do it) so I use that milk with their cereal.  They call it their 'vegetable milk' and have become accustomed to it in their cereal.  It does start to separate after a few minutes so the milk has a grainy, green texture to it.  But, again, they get used to it and, for kids who aren't begging to eat their veggies every day, this is a great way to get more nutrients in to their growing bodies.

review/summary: TERRIFIC TASTE AND HEALTH BENEFITS TOO  --  SMALL SIZE ASSURES FRESHNESS WHEN YOU USE IT!
review/text: IN A NUTSHELL:<br /><br />This Goya "EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL" is one of the smartest buys one can make. This is "Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Imported from Spain and is stated to be "All Natural & Cold Pressed". Bear in mind that "All Natural" is not "Certified Organic".<br /><br />WHAT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE IS USED FOR:<br /><br />That being said, this is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their "Extra Light" product as it has a much higher smoke point.<br /><br />HEALTH BENEFITS:<br /><br />PROVEN PROTECTION AGAINST ATHEROSCLEROSIS:<br /><br />Eating foods high in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), [found in Olive, canola & flaxseed oil] will increase the blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to confer a large measure of protection against atherosclerosis. As part of the "Mediterranean" diet, researchers used products high in ALA, and found that the ALA reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 70% over the first 27 months.<br /><br />Canola and Peanut oil also contain large amounts of ALA and are similarly cardio-protective. The presence of a larger proportion of "mono-saturated fats" is central to the cardio-protective properties of the oil.<br /><br />-----*- NO Cholesterol -- -*- No Trans-Fat<br /><br />WHICH SIZE IS BEST FOR YOU?<br /><br />This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $3. for 8 ounces. However, it does vary regional and depending on the packaging [bottle or tin] may cost somewhat less by volume. Bear in mind, that Olive will become rancid if you store it for prolonged periods. You can, however, extend this period by keeping the oil in a cool and dry place, preferably dark. Also, don't buy the largest containers unless you can finish them within 1-2 months. Smaller containers like this 8 ounce bottle may be more costly per volume than the liter or gallon size containers, but the oil will be fresh when you use it and that is critical.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

review/summary: bad experience buying mixed nuts online for the first time
review/text: The Pack of 3 arrived but by the look of them they don't seem to be worth the price. A bit pricey, and may as well get mixed nuts from local grocery supermarkets, I thought. Not happy.<br /><br />One of the three packs came half-filled, making it a pouch with less than 5 Ounce of mixed nuts, although the pouch is intact so I guess that was a faulty product. Not happy times 2.<br /><br />One of the two seemingly 10 Ounce pouches has a date-like print "03 26 13 GB", but I came across quite a few gone-bad pistachio nuts which you can't tell until you've tasted them. Not happy times 3.<br /><br />Overall, I probably won't buy this again.

review/text: Read the description of product and thought it sounded good.  Have always eaten cashews, almonds and pistachios with no reaction.  Liked the fact that it had no added oils.  However, after first eating a small handful I began to itch and itch and itch.  So I waited a day and tried 5 and again I itched and itched.  I find it hard to believe that with the ingredients of nuts and sea salt that I would find myself reacting so much.  There has to be somethng more to this product than nuts and salt since I have never reacted to these ingredients before.  Be warned.

review/text: the reason for the poor evaluation is not because of the item.  The lollipops are wonderful BUT, a 1 lb 5 oz box which costs $16.20 has a shipping cost of $15.25!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Almost the same as the cost of the item.<br /><br />If you go to the website (www.sees.com) in the shipping section you will see that there are a variety of shipping costs depending upon when you want the item.  I just paid $7.25 rather than $15.25 and I'll have to wait a week which is probably as long as I'd have to wait if I had ordered the box from Amazon since there is a disclaimer that says "Processing takes an additional 2 to 3 days for orders from this seller"<br /><br />Don't get cheated!

review/summary: Among the best if not the best!
review/text: After my brother, a film animator formerly with the Walt Disney Company, made a TV commercial for Season Brand Sardines I decided to try the product and have been a lover of the tiny (Brisling) variety since then.  This is now more than 20 years ago.  They are packed in various sauces and oils but my favorite is pure olive oil and lightly smoked, wild caught from the cold waters off Scotland.  I cannot imagine doing better than that.  Most sardine lovers whether they eat them for health (they contain over 2,500mg of Omega 3 fatty acids) or just as a wonderful gourmet food love the tiny ones.  The taste is nut-like and delicious.  I like them best in a sandwich of toasted, seeded Jewish rye with Romaine lettuce.  There's nothing else needed.

review/text: So, my favorite sardine supplier stopped for a while and I decided to try some other brands and configurations.  These are among the most expensive, but they were a pleasant surprise.  I understand why so many sardine eaters just get these little ones.  There was eighteen of the little fish in the can I just ate!<br /><br />I suppose the best I can do to describe the taste comparison with the big ones I'm more accustomed to is that the big ones have a sort of tuna-ish taste whereas these tend to taste a bit more like clams or oysters.  The smell is fishy as ever, but the taste is more mild.  Quite nice actually.

I use it to make instant tomato soup, for sauces and in salsa as well as adding to soups, stews, and every where else that one might want some tomato  flavor.  Very easy to adjust texture  can be tomato paste or juice  and is fun to experiment with I even made little tomato balls as a kind of oddball appetizer and everyone who tried them was blown away. Very light weight dry does pack down a bit but has stayed dry in the jug with no problems. This is a  great staple for both daily use and food storage.  The tomato powder hasappeal for both  old fashioned homey nostalgia and a bit of Jetsons O wow!edge too.

review/text: I bought this mainly out of curiousity, and it sat on the shelf for a while until I started experimenting with it.  It has a very concentrated tomato flavor, so if you are looking for a quick way to impart more tomato flavor to a dish, this will do it.  Add a little at a time until you get to know how it works.<br /><br />But my favorite way to use it has been on home made pizza in place of tomato sauce.  A light sprinkling before baking yields a delicious tomato flavor without the soggy crust that sauce can often create.  Just sprinkle it on the pizza dough, add oregano and any other herbs and spices,your favorite toppings and bake as usual.

review/summary: Ok, but not sure if I would purchase again
review/text: I purchased this item for my mom who has type 2 diabetes. Her glucose level for the most part, remained in the normal range using this product as a sweetener in her tea. Although this product appears to work well in preventing sugar spikes, my two issues with it is, (1) the ridiculous shipping cost and (2)it does not have a favorable taste with all tea. I have not tried using it in baking goods, so I can not comment on that, at this time.

review/summary: It was okay
review/text: The palm sugar is okay.  I was hoping it would be more like a granulated type sugar.  It's very clumpy and I constantly have to break the clumps apart.  But the flavor is great, and I find I don't need very much.  I have only used it in my coffee so far.

review/summary: Not bad as a substitute
review/text: The Coconut Palm Sugar wasn't too bad as a substitute for baking, however, it is significantly less sweet then  white sugar. I enjoyed that it wasn't as sweet but for those that want a sweet pastry, you may need to readjust the amount when using the coconut palm sugar. Also, it is hard to make a syrup out of it and melts quite a bit faster than white sugar.

review/summary: OK, this is not a Jewish company alright?
review/text: LOL Don't be intimidated by all these exotic Goya products, the company<br />is actually the oldest and most revered of all the commercial Spanish foods<br />companies and Chimichurri can best be described as Argentine Pesto.<br /><br />This is my favorite Chimichurri sauce, and its properly made with olive oil.<br />But not just any olive oil....Spanish Extra Virgin Olive Oil and in my book<br />it just doesn't get any better than that. (note: avoid similar products made<br />with vegetable oil)<br /><br />Following the traditional recipe, this makes a delicious dressing for any<br />grilled meat including burgers and sausages. But where this really shines<br />is as a marinade rather than a finisher. This has a tangy herbaceous flavor<br />and you will taste the blend of garlic, parsley, onion, olive oil, apple cider<br />vinegar, oregano and white pepper. Want more flavor, add your own herbs or<br />garlic but I think this blend is perfect right out of the jar.<br /><br />It can also be used as a spread with bread or to add a boost to vegetables,<br />salads and soups. And while mainly used for steak, this stuff works really<br />well on fish and grilled shrimp too or for making Bruchetta, or even just<br />with cheese and crackers. Its very versatile and you will find any number<br />of uses for this terrific concoction.<br /><br />IMO, this is the Heavyweight Champ of commercial Chimichurri sauces.

review/text: I'm not a huge fan of herbal tea, but the taste of this tea is OK, and it is a great value and easy to brew.  What I really love about it, however, is that after drinking it for a couple of weeks, it has noticeably reduced my blood pressure.  I try to drink two cups a day, and am hoping it will bring my numbers down even more with a little bit of time.  Very happy to have found this natural remedy!

review/summary: Davidson's Hibiscus Tea
review/text: I just received this tea and I'm trying to drink a couple of cups per day to see if it has any effect on my BP. So far so good.  To enhance the flavor of this rather sour tea, I've added some Teavana Orange Blossom Herbal Tea, or Peach Bloom Rooibos Tea.  These combinations make the hibuscus tea quite enjoyable to drink.  I'm sure there are many other teas that would complement the Davidson hibiscus.

review/text: I just wanted to say I was very pleasantly surprised to receive this tea in such a huge bag!  The tea is so yummy.  I just pour boiling water over a few petals from the kettle and let steep 5 mins.  Sometimes I add a spoon of sugar but most of the time just drink it without.  When the tea is ready to drink, all the petals sink to the bottom and I don't bother removing them till after I've drank the tea.  I am hooked!  Love it!

I soaked the petals into hot water without boiling and hoping to keep the ingredients alive, it turns out to be tasting so great that I need to add water for dilution, proving the product is originally ( well preserved) plus organic, can't complain. Highly recommend it.

review/summary: Great deal
review/text: I think this is a very good deal for the price. You receive a really large bag of leaves, and they seem to be very good quality. I bought this product for its benefits in lowering high blood pressure, and my last test was normal. Not sure if it was the tea or a combination of natural remedies, but it can't have hurt. The tea itself is a little bitter if you're just drinking it by itself, so I use a sweetener and it ends up tasting quite good.

review/text: I bought this to make my own version of Starbucks' passion tea at home. It's really yummy!<br /><br />You get A LOT of hibiscus flowers. The tea itself it tangy and fragrant. I make according to the directions but double or triple the flowers to make a concentrate to pour over ice. I add the Starbucks melon syrup to it. If you can't find the Starbucks syrup, the tea still tastes great with honey, agave or enjoyed plain. I also quickly rinse my hibiscus before brewing.<br /><br />I've never purchased hibiscus before so I can't tell if this is good quality or not, but I'm really happy with my purchase.

review/summary: Great Taste and Deep Red Color
review/text: Just a couple petals per cup makes a deep red brew.  I've never used "full-bodied" to describe a cup of tea before, but I think that's how I'd describe the tea that results from these hibiscus flowers.  The flavor really pops out at you and tastes almost as if it's been sweetened.  It's a very pleasant drink.  Consider the known health benefits of hibiscus tea, the fact that this is organic (which greatly improves the nutritional value), and the unbelievably low price of like $12 for a pound (a pound of this will probably last me 4 months), and you have yourself a winner.  Celestial Seasonings primarily uses hibiscus in their teas, but they charge like $3 per box of 20 tea bags, so this clearly comes out on top in my book.

review/summary: Not original hibiscus flower tea
review/text: I love this tea, its everything everybody is saying about it. But from the first time I brewed this tea, my husband took one look and said to me that its not hibiscus but sorrel tea. I argued, whatever but I decided to look it up anyways  because the tea did look and taste like sorrel drink that we make in the Caribbean.  In the US its called red hibiscus or roselle or Florida cranberry. It does lower blood pressure and it is healthy. My point is that folks think they are drinking actual flower tea and it is misleading when  advertisers have these pretty hibiscus flowers on the cans etc (not this particular brand). This plant is comercially grown in the tropics and also in the US in Louisiana and Florida.
