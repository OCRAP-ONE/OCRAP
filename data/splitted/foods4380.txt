review/summary: Jake gives these 5 stars!
review/text: My best friend, an aging Shetland Sheepdog named Jake, absolutely loves these treats!  We used to get them from a local pet store, but recently moved -- can't find them anywhere nearby.  So of course, we turned to Amazon, where happily they are half the price (before shipping) we were used to paying.<br /><br />Jake had hip dysplasia surgery as a young adult dog, he walks with a noticable limp, that was slowly becoming worse.  He shunned glucosamine supplements so they were of little help, but since we found these wonderful treats, his gait doesn't seem to be degrading any further... So I am very happy that we can still get them here...<br /><br />Because I love my little dog to pieces, and anything that makes his life a little better or a little longer is a great thing -- that he enjoys eating them makes them a godsend!

review/text: I have no clue how these taste, but my German Shepherd is crazy in love with them.  'Xena' seems to be much improved in the hips area also.  She had trouble with stairs and jumping in general, but is pretty much back to puppy-status after a few months of eating these.<br /><br />I have to take Xena's word for it, these things work.

review/summary: Our Dog loves these best
review/text: We have tried some other dog treats enriched to help with hip problems and our dog absolutely loves these the most. With his other snacks we had to hide them in cheese because he was not interested in them...but he really looks forward to these chicken snacks. The price is great too... because we paid $[...] for the initial 16 oz. bag (we ordered from an online pet site) and now we are going to order the 2 lbs. bag from Amazon for just three dollars more because we know our dog will appreciate them.<br /><br />When we started using these treats our dog's hip was dislocated and since eating the snack each day his hip is getting noticably better and he seems to be happier...less cranky which I think might be due to the inflamation in his hip going away. It's a thin easy to eat strip that our dog loves.

review/summary: Dogs love them
review/text: I bought this product so to try something different for my 12 yr old cocker spaniel and my other younger dogs. I was attracted by the fact that it has glucosamine, which helps for healthy joints. Recently my cocker has been looking as if she was in pain as if her joints were bothering her. This product has helped her greatly and shes up and running around like shes 5 yrs younger. They love these things and I have to restrict them to one and maybe two a day. They're pricey but I bought them because of the glucosamine and hoped they would like them. I just purchased another bag, well worth the money....

They are chicken strips that sort of resemble bacon.  Sometimes he tries to swallow them whole but then figures out he has to chew them.  Big dogs are prone to hip problems so this seems a great way to get a little Glucosamine and Chondroitin in his system.

review/summary: Food from China is killing our pets!
review/text: I used to feed these to my dogs with caution knowing that they come from China.  The pet food store I bought them from got all the reports from the company about how good they are in quality.  But even now the local *good* pet food stores are not carrying them.  They don't want the liability of these items potentially harming and killing pets.  It's not hard to do your own chicken jerky, or buy USA products.  Don't just reduce the amount of these you are giving, just stop giving them.  Let's buy from reputable sources.  Remember the pet food from China a couple of years ago that was killing pets due to a contaminant?

review/summary: Happy Hips are a Hit with Dog and Owner
review/text: I've never met a dog who has refused a happy hip treat.  In fact, my dog loves them so much she will "balk" at any other treats if she sees the happy hips bag.  If we've been out for a little while, she gets so excited when she sees the new bag arrive from the UPS man - she practically does back flips so I think they are working too.  She's 12 and has been moving better since we have made sure to give her the 5-8 recommended treats per day.<br />As an owner, I love that they smell good, they are basically just dehydrated chicken breast with added supplements so I feel we are giving her a really healthy treat that is actually helping her joints.  Only complaint is the price but really one 32 ounce bag lasts us over a month and we can usually fine that size online for less than $25 so it works out to be about $5 per week and she's worth it.<br />Next, we are trying the calming treat line for her thunderstorm anxieties and different flavors in the happy hip line.<br />Thanks, Dogswell!<br />'

review/summary: It wil not only make your dogs very sick, it may kill them!
review/text: I had to give it one star to register my review...If I could I would have the entire company shut down!!!!!  My dog ate a whole bag of these when the plumber left the contents under the sink all over the floor and I did not see Pele get the bag.  Shortly after she went into acute renal failure and almost died.  After a little research and learning these are made in China, I read over and over again about how sick people's dogs were getting when just feeding ONE treat of Happy Hips!  Through different tests done at the vet and ruling out what put her in the kidney failure, I have come to the conclusion that this is the product that almost killed my dog.  Yes she did eat the whole bag, but they are supposed to be JUST CHICKEN!!!!!  Please do not feed your dog Chicken Strips made in China, EVER!  Read the horror stories online if you don't believe me!!  Better yet, do not buy any food products made in China, you may want to do some research if you are, the stories out there are horrifying!!!

review/summary: Made in China treats still KILLING dogs - ABC NEWS 2012!
review/text: Yes, dogs love these treats but educate yourself before you buy any dog treats made in china.  This company is aware of the stigma behind products made in china but they're not going to bring their manufacturing to the US until consumers care enough about their dogs to stop buying this product.<br /><br />Per ABC News;<br />Just six months after issuing its latest warning about chicken jerky dog treats made in China, the Food and Drug Administration confirms it has logged more than 900 complaints from pet owners who say their dogs either were sickened or died after eating the treats.<br /><br />The number of complaints has nearly doubled since the story was first reported by ABC News in March. The FDA says its investigation is ongoing and that it continues to test samples of the popular treats, which dog owners across the country say have caused kidney failure in their pets, resulting in severe illness or death.<br /><br />[...]

My dog almost died and is still trying to recover from being poisoned by these. They would be recalled by now but the FDA told me that they don't know what the ingredient is that is sickening dogs so they can't recall? This has been going on since 2007. The owner of Dogwell could care less as I have also spoke with him bottom line for him $$$,not your pet. Do a little research google jerky treats from China you don't want your pet to go though what mine has. Bloody stools, vomiting, shaking, back legs became paralyzed he could not walk or stand.

review/summary: Adult Black Tea with Darjeeling and Berry Overtones
review/text: *****<br />I really enjoy Numi's Berry Black Fruitea Darjeeling Black Tea, because unlike most berry teas, I taste the black tea and the Darjeeling far more intensely than the berries...the berries are more like overtones and definitely not overwhelming, creating what I think is a more adult berry black tea. The flavors of this tea are thankfully complex.<br /><br />Berry Black is certified organic and contains fair trade certified organic Darjeeling black tea, organic hibiscus, organic freeze-dried strawberries, organic freeze-dried raspberries, organic rosehips, and organic raspberry leaf. There are no oils or natural flavorings used, unlike many berry teas. It is also kosher. This tea is sustainable in that all packaging materials are biodegradable and recyclable, the carton is made of 100% post-consumer waste, and cello wrap is not used. Numi says that all their tea bags "are made of natural fiber paper, not the trendy, "silky" see-though nylon tea bags". The reason it is called "full leaf" is that Numi black teas do not contain tea dust or fannings, which tend to make tea taste bitter; instead, they contain the full leaf, expanding when they are brewed, "releasing a robust and long lasting experience".<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Extraordinary and the first of its kind, Numi's organic Berry Black features real North American forest fruits, not artificial or natural flavorings, to create an authentic berry taste. Our luscious strawberries and raspberries are freeze-dried at the peak of ripeness to retain their true flavor. This sassy, organic tea is fresh, wild, and all natural, blending hibiscus, Vitamin C-loaded rosehips, and a touch of smooth organic Darjeeling. Grown in the high mountains of India, Numi's special Darjeeling adds a floral balance as it captures the depth of black tea. Discover the berried treasure in each cup - you'll be hooked!"<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love Darjeeling tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

The other dip mix had freeze dried artichokes in it and cheese.  All you had to add was mayo and sour cream. It was quick, easy and awesome.  This is nothing but a bag of powder that is hard to reconstitute with mayo and sour cream.  Then you have to add your own artichokes and cheese. What's the point of a mix if you have to provide virtually everything.  The flavor is very artificial and for some reason still tastes like powder hours later.  Yuck.  What a disappointment.

review/summary: You get what you pay for?  Or is catnip tantamount to snake oil?
review/text: This is the first catnip I've bought.  It seemed the best bang for the buck at the time of purchase, especially considering the top rated brand was 1/3 the amount for the same price.  I've used it in toys, rubbed it between my fingers as the package directs, etc.; yet our three month old kitten just doesn't seem to care.  She'll "usually" come up and take a whiff when I open the bag or coax her to see what I've got in my hand, but she quickly loses interest.  And it never manages to put her into some euphoric state, much less even settle her down, when she's running around, going crazy, as growing, restless housecats do.<br /><br />The catnip smells mostly like ground tea leaves, to me.  The only praise I can offer regards the volume that comes in the package compared to most other offerings on amazon, and that it comes in a resealable bag - not a "ziplock" bag like another reviewer indicated; it's clearly a professionally packaged product, but one with a ziplock style closure.  And, as others have noted, the bag is 3oz NOT 3.5 as amazon's title erroneously misadvertises.  Even so, it's still the best value on amazon, assuming it works as well as the other, more expensive, brands.  Considering all but maybe the most expensive has received mixed reviews of effectiveness, and that the best rated/most expensive option appears to be charging more for a tin can, I'm reluctant to invest more in a product that may only be effective for certain cats, if indeed it's not another form of snake oil.  Maybe I should have done my usual research beforehand.<br /><br />Update:  Having put this in several toys, a cardboard scratching pad and even sprinkled a little on her food once or twice per week, our kitten not only shows disinterest in this product now, but practically runs away when I open the bag as if the smell actually offends her.  We have three large, cat-eating dogs outside, which we rescued her from right after they got two of her siblings - they had wondered into the dogs radio fence boundaries and got trapped inside a tractor - so she has to stay indoors.  I was really hoping this might settle her down when she gets stir crazy.  But it doesn't, not in the least.

review/summary: Cat won't go near it
review/text: I bought this catnip because I couldn't find the brand I wanted on Amazon. I opened it immediately but the cat won't go near it. I've tried different ways to get her to interact to no avail. I would save your $5 and buy another brand. There is nothing spectacular about this product.

review/summary: not Xtreme-don't buy this just for the implications!
review/text: Hi.  My cats (all 4 of them) didn't react as enthusiastically as I thought they would--they seem to like the other less expensive brands just as much, if not better.<br />  Unless you can get a good deal, don't go on just what the Xtreme title implies. Do, however, try to go organic-your pets don't need the added chemicals.

review/text: Pros:<br /><br />Good bulk for your money (3.5 oz)<br /><br />They have it in resealable ziplock foil/plastic containers now that hold moisture very well. They should update the photo. Every bag I've gotten is fresh. i.e. the nip has a little moisture left but not much. When I open it you can smell catnip even as a human from a little distance.<br /><br />My cats absolutely love it, and they leave me alone for about an hour after each pinch. They just entertain themselves rolling around on the floor.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />It's still expensive compared to just growing your own catnip.

I have not tried the light roast, but the medium roast was very nice, with an earthy aroma and just the right amount of "boldness" to it without going overboard.<br /><br />Also, I read the one star review posted, and have to say we experienced none of the "bottom of the pot after three hours" problem with our delivery.  In fact, we are ordering another 5 pounds!<br /><br />Edit: This review is for the WHOLE BEAN coffee rather than ground, same brand and roast.

I was surprised when the store started carrying this dog food as we have no affiliation to it. I was currently using Iams which at the time was going thru tainted ingredient issues. So I did some investigative work on some dog food review/rating websites and was pleasantly surprised by the positive reviews for this product.<br /><br />You can also go to [...] website for details on the holistic benefits. I switched my dogs to this food around 3-4 years ago and am so glad that I did. I just read an article on [...] which rated this brand as one of the top 4 dog foods and a "best buy" compared to other premium brands.

review/text: The vet wants Baron to lose a little weight, but I also want him to enjoy his food. I've tried some that I had to add other ingredients to or he wouldn't eat. That defeated the purpose of getting quality food and giving him less of it. He's also showing signs of aging, for very good reason. He's old. I keep reminding myself of that so it won't hurt so bad when I wake up some morning and find him gone. I want to keep him healthy and happy as long as possible.  He seems to be doing very well on this food. A few minutes ago he was bouncing around like a puppy. He looked happy. That's all I can base my review on. Others have discussed the ingredients. I just judge the bounces.

review/summary: Excellent food for your loved one!!  Can't beat it!
review/text: Of of my dogs is starting to show signs of age - limping, joint pain.  I started researching things I could do to help him and one of those items is diet!  I'd always fed Iams and thought it a great food and it wasn't until I did research that I realised how wrong I was.  Just like people prefer unhealthy food - animals do also.  Most comercial dog food brands know this and so they put all that bad stuff in it to get your pet to like it and in turn makes you think you are doing a wonderful thing!  This pet food is made with quality ingrediants and doesn't cost much more than Iams.  I've already noticed my dogs eat less so the price evens out.  And thanks to the Senior formula my older dog is benefiting from not only much better and greater nutrition but also from the joint supplements added.  I'm SO GLAD my large dogs like this food!  THANK YOU CHICKEN SOUP!!!  I have also changed my cats over to the cat food.  This way all my loving pets get the best!

review/summary: Our Dog Thrives on Chicken Soup
review/text: When we adopted our boy Nemo he was a few pounds overweight. And, since he was a senior, we put him on Chicken Soup. He lost the extra pounds over a few months. In addition to becoming leaner, he seemed in all around better condition on this food. Likely, however, he was being served a poor diet by his previous owner. Still, I think this food is very good for the money. My vet agrees. While our dog doesn't gobble this down like he does his treats, he certainly seems pleased to eat it and always finishes it up. I feel good about feeding this high quality chow to Nemo. I want him around as long as possible, and I wouldn't give him this food if I didn't think it would help in that goal.

review/summary: My Opinion
review/text: I was a Veterinary Technician for 12 years and my Vets have recommended this food to me for my own dogs. The Vets I worked for don't sell dog food like a lot of Vets do and this is the food they fed their own personal dogs. My dog has been on it his entire life (10 years old), he was on the puppy formula as a pup, then adult formula from 1-8 years old, and now he's on the senior formula which adds Glucosamine/Chondroiton in the food. He truly is the picture of health. He's a Yellow Labrador and he's in remarkably great physical condition, he even jogs 5 miles a day with me every single day. I have never had any problems with this food and my dog loves it. I love their ingredients (Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Salmon, etc.) most of which is their first ingredients and their quality is second to none, can't beat it for the price.

review/summary: Taste is a bit on the plain side
review/text: The only issue keeping us from rating this as 5 stars is, the taste is a bit bland.  This from a dog who is not in the least bit fussy over food or snacks.<br />A bit of fish oil mixed in, and he chows it down, heartily.<br />Super-Mutt is still very active, without a weight issue.  The change to this food was based on kidney functions.  His previous food had a 34% Protein content (Wellness Core).  High protein and old kidneys are not a good mix, in our case.<br />Digestibility has been excellent.  Volume to weight, this is a heavy food.  We are still feeding the same volume of food, but it is actually more food (by weight) as it is smaller kibble.  So even though the protein is lower than his previous food, the content seems very close.  No weight gain or loss over the past two months.<br />The change over between the two foods was very easy, with solid stools during the 9 days of transition.<br />Overall by adding just a bit of oil, it seems to be working well.  Time will tell.<br /><br />Edit (July 3rd 2012)*******<br />We are still feeding this food, and he is doing well on it.  Still active for his age (let's face it, he just likes to show off for the girls at the park ;o) ).<br /><br />His weight is easy to maintain with this food.  At the last Vet check up, his  kidney function is more normal.<br />As he's an old dog, some days are greater than others.  On the "other" days, we mix just a tablespoon of wet food stirred in, and he's happy.<br /><br />His teeth are pretty worn from a long life, but he is still able to eat this smaller kibble really well. No choking, or pieces going down the wrong pipe. He can crunch away with his molars.<br /><br />Digestibility is very good, with smaller stools that are just firm enough to be healthy for him (keeping the anal glands expressed).<br /><br />We think the 4 out of 5 stars is still relevant, due to blandness in taste.<br /><br />Hope your buddies do as well. :o)

review/summary: I'll never feed my dog's Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul or any other food made by Diamond
review/text: Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON.  They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year.  And about two weeks before the "voluntary" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help).  Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics.  Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant.  Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were.  They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it.  But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.)  Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence.  So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs.  I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me.  I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened.  They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.<br /><br />What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall.  I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open.  So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned.  (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through "other" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs.  I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.)  This company is SCUM.  People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!<br /><br />If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all.

review/summary: Product I Received was NOT on Recall List - 2 Months Newer
review/text: I was alarmed to hear about the recall AFTER I had ordered this product on July 11, 2012. I immediately checked the Diamond recall website and checked the codes against the recall list. I was happy to find that not only were the codes not on the list but more significantly, the Best Before Date was 04 Jun 2013 which is almost 2 months AFTER the date of 7 April, 2013 which is the end of the date range in the recall.<br /><br />I figured that the time range was the most significant factor because the factory would be in operation daily and the fiasco with the salmonella would have been cleared up during that time.<br /><br />The most significant test was of course the fact that our dog did not get ill.<br /><br />I should mention that this was shipped directly from Amazon and sold by Amazon. I cannot comment about the newness of products sold by other vendors.<br /><br />It is tough to find high quality, high meat content dog food which is affordable. While it is easy to condemn Diamond, I think this is one of the more affordable high meat content foods out there. Invariably, a poor quality dogfood like Beneful which despite its fancy packaging is basically corn with a tiny flavoring of meat, is going to have less problems with bacteria because it has so little meat.<br /><br />Hopefully, this incident which no doubt cost Diamond millions, will get them to be much more careful in the future.

review/text: This dog food is terrific.  My dogs love it and it is very filling.  They don't eat it all up really fast like with the cheaper brands.  I have a greyhound and they have skin problems when they eat the wrong kinds of food.  Not the case with this food.  The only thing that I am disappointed about is that I have ordered through amazon and I chose 2 day shipping and it has been 5 days and they still havent shipped the dog food.

review/summary: Great dog treat.
review/text: I have used RedBarn for years. My dog loves it.  I cut it into two inch chunks, Freeze it, and keep one chunk in the refrigerator. I cut off a small slice as a treat as Mosby (my dog) and I walk. He loves it and is eager to obey me.  (Mosby is a relatively good dog, German Shepherd).<br />Other dogs we've tried it on also loved it and were easier to train. In one case, the owner said he was untrainable, and after a sample of the dog treat, he quickly learned to come to my whistle.<br /><br />I routinely walk Mosby without a leash. He comes to a call, clap, or whistle (assuming the proper reward).<br /><br />Unlike hot dog slices, this stuff is good for him.  Mosby is now 11 YO and in fairly good shape.

review/summary: Awesome dog food product!
review/text: When I first purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006NLXL6">Chicken Food Roll for Dogs, 4lb</a>, it was at a sell-out at a Tractor Supply in Kearney, Nebraska for a couple bucks. That was then. Today,it is a mainstay for our dog rescue for elderly dogs with bad or no teeth, ill dogs as a wholesome and natural food product, or as ways to tempt the pickiest dog and the ones with sensitive stomaches. There is nothing to compare. And as far as Amazon's PetFood Direct, they deliver faster than any company I buy from! Today, I buy three rolls of the 4 lb. roll at a time --- chicken only!

review/summary: Great for training
review/text: I use this product for training my dogs.  I cut it into slices, and then into small bite size pieces.  My dog will perform almost any trick for these treats.  I don't worry about giving her too much, because it is pretty healthy.  Some of the dog owners will give their dogs cut up hotdogs at the training classes, and although that is probably ok, I feel these are a lot healthier for my pet.  Also, for the money, you get a lot more treats than you would when buying prepackaged training treats.

review/summary: QUALITY AND FLEXIBILITY
review/text: I've owned five German Shepherds, one Dalmation, and one mixed breed dog over a 15 plus yr. period. The Redbarn product is far superior in quality. Not one dog has disliked the product. The plus is that you don't have to refrigerate the Red Barn roll until it is opened. Also, the portions of food you use from the roll can be adjusted by you in the event your budget is a little tighter at certain times of the month. I put slices of the food on top of a good quality dry dog kibble when I need to stretch my money.  I like the variety in sizes of the rolls as well as varied content of each roll.  Finally, many sources are embracing this product, and I am glad this site sells it at the most reasonable prices I have seen.  LORI, Phila.

review/summary: Great for treats and training!
review/text: I love this stuff. My DOG loves this stuff. I don't use it as a food but as a training aid. They are strong-smelling enough to be effective, I take the entire roll and cut the whole thing up into little cubes (about 1CM). I put a handfuls into seperate baggies, saving one to train immediately then freeze the rest. As soon as one baggie is empty, I move another bag from the freezer to the fridge to defrost. My dog is now trained but still gets these as a treat. Now we have a puppy and he is motivated to learn quickly with these!

review/summary: Great for training treats
review/text: I am a professional dog trainer and I buy this product constantly.  It's a good price for a training treat. One 4 lb roll will last me just over a month when actively training large breed dogs. ( I would say would last one month, as training treats, for 2-3 large breed dogs, depending on their food drive).  I find this to be relatively gentle on their stomachs as well.

Then, while visiting in Florida I discovered Snyder's of Hanover Unsalted Mini Pretzels.  They are delicious and only 75mg. of sodium for 20 mini pretzels.  The bonus is that they are fat free.  I could not find them anywhere in my area so Thank you to Amazon for selling them, and at a cheaper price than Snyder's website.  I even gave my doctor a bag.  He has high blood pressure too!

review/text: I originally got these because I thought I wouldn't want to eat as many while trying to lose weight.  I have come to love these unsalted pretzels.  I decided to "splurge" on a bag of regular pretzels and gagged on them because of the amount of salt.  I had to throw away the bag.  I am sticking to these unsalted pretzels for as long as the company makes them.  I started having trouble finding them in local stores, so I was so excited to find them on Amazon and at a better price, too!!<br /><br />5/15 -- I was going to reorder again.  Wow -- the price has really gone up since I first ordered them and since my last order.  They are now about the price of getting them at the grocery store.  Hope the price goes back down soon.

review/summary: Perfect afternoon snack to help avoid a feeding frenzy
review/text: I love the fact that these pretzels come in 100 calorie packs. It is just the right amount for an afternoon snack. We have a bunch of pretzels, peanuts, almonds, etc. on a snack table at work. Around 2:30 every afternoon my resolve to stay away from the salty, filling (and fattening) yummy goodness on the table would start to wane. By 2:32 I would be coming up with reasons to hover around the snack table. By 2:40 I'd be covered in peanut shells, done with my feeding frenzy and figuring out how I was going to avert a repeat performance tomorrow. Then I found Snyder's of Hanover 100 Calorie packs. Seriously, folks, they are my saving grace. And they have just the right amount of salt. I thought 60 bags would be a ridiculous amount if pretzels to purchase, but it worked out great, they lasted a couple of months and I've already purchased another box.

Since moving to the midwest, I have not been able to find them.  I was very disappointed in them when they were shipped.  About 1/4 of the bag was pieces and crumbs.  Another reviewer mentioned this and I should have known, but I really had been craving pretzels and was hoping that Snyders had fixed their problem with shipping. Pretzels, great; shipping not so goood.

review/text: These unsalted pretzels are by far the best quick snack i have found.  no salt on the pretzel, virtually no fat, and very good taste.  the direct sale from snyders with no shipping cost ensure my repeat business.

review/text: The orange flavor is truly great...I liked it even more than the regular dried cranberry.  Good choice for snacking and a good price too.

review/summary: Still Crazy for Silly Bananas
review/text: Have really enjoyed the Silly Bananas Candies that I bought this past April. Mind you I haven't eaten them in years but the pretty Easter colors I really like. So I bought them and now I treat myself to a handful once or twice a week. I have to go easy on them due to health reasons. But thank you so much SweetGourment.com you've got a yummy product. And thank you too Amazon.com.  Sincerely, Rosario Elaine Torres  San Antonio, Texas

review/text: Yes, taste is a personal matter. These were more fun to look at than eat. They don't have much flavor. My junk food junky kids rejected them.

review/summary: Doesn't go that far...
review/text: I bought this hoping to cut down on all the 1/2 gallon cardboard garbage from Rice Dream that I buy in the grocery store.  I found, to get a palatable flavor, each 21.4 oz container makes about 2 gallons (or 4 1/2 gallons).  So yes, you dispose of 1 container for every 4 store bought 1/2 gallon containers, but it actually costs more per half gallon (5$) than the price I pay for my Rice Dream (4$ per half gallon).  I was expecting it to go a lot further.  Some may prefer it less creamy but I try to approximate the thickness and sweetness level of the Rice Dream Original.
