review/summary: Spicey goodness
review/text: I'm addicted to Yogi Teas and have vowed to try them all.  This Indian Spice tea is delicious. I've found that many of the Yogi teas are not as strong as I want them to be, so the tea bag stays in until I've drank all the tea. Not so with this tea, this tea has a VERY strong Cinnamon taste, which I find enjoyable. In truth, I may have left the bag in too long today, as the cinnamon flavor is burning a little.<br />The directions on the box say to add milk (or milk substitute) and sweetener to the tea. They mean it. I tried to drink it plain, but couldn't, it just didn't taste right. However, I did add a popular flavored coffee creamer, and that worked beautifully.  This is a whole new drink now, doesn't feel like tea, it feels like a treat. Enjoy.

review/summary: Blackberry Goodness! Gluten Free!
review/text: I first tried this sauce at the farmer's market and found myself coming back for more. I prefer the original WildeBerryaki variety and my boyfriend likes the Spicy variety. It goes well on stir-fry or rice. Tastes like teriyaki sauce with a soft blackberry essence - a great summer food! Also - it's gluten free and low in sodium, which is a plus. Will purchase again!

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

review/summary: Actually NICE for sugarfree preserves...I will be ordering MORE in other flavors
review/text: I've tried other low-carb, sugar-free spreads/preserves/jams in the past, and I've hated them all. I remember buying Steel's cause a slew of low-carbers recommended it,and I ended up throwing out the jars I got. Horrible. Chemically.<br /><br />This actually made me stop and go, "Wow, this is pleasant."<br /><br />Let's face it, it's not regular, sugar-laden preserves with that thick, luxurious texture. But it's also only 20 cals per tablespoon and doesn't spike your sugar. If you have diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome, insulin issues, or are just a low-carb dieter (or dieter in general), this line of preserves is worth checking out.<br /><br />The Lowdown: I first used it on plain old toast over Smart Balance (I love the combo of fat spread with sweet spread, whether it's cream cheese and grape jelly or butter and jam.) It was very nice. The spread is thinner than I expect preserves to be--like a thickish fruit coulis, fruit puree, sort of thing. The taste is very fruity, apricotty, with an acidic edge. That's the reason I removed a star--the thinnish texture and slightly overacidic bite. However, I don't want to exaggerate either. It was a good flavor and a nice addition to breakfast. Also nice over low-fat waffles and pancakes, if you go for that sort of thing.<br /><br />I want to try the strawberry and blueberry, and I foresee that this might become a staple in my pantry. Finally, a lower carb, sugar-free preserve that I can enjoy.<br /><br />Update: I'm switching my rating to 5 stars. I'm just enjoying this more and more. Maybe my spring allergies affected my perception of the flavor, cause since my congestion eased, this tastes BETTER. I'm almost done with the jar and next time will stock up with 3. Yum.

review/summary: My favorite jams - regardless sugar-free or not
review/text: I've searched far and wide for good low carb food stuffs and have only found a few that are truly edible. The Nature's Hollow line, though, is remarkable - not just because it tastes good as a sugar free jam/preserve, but in my opinion the Apricot and, especially the Strawberry flavors are what I'd eat if I didn't eat low carb. The flavors are bold and fresh. The blueberry can be a bit syrupy but the raspberry, strawberry, and apricot are pretty good. Though, I recommend keeping all of them in the fridge. Personally, I combine the preserves with a tablespoon of Trader Joe's Sunflower Seed Butter over a La Tortilla Factory low-carb tortilla and I've got a high-fiber, healthy fat, low carb treat that's tough to beat.

review/summary: My loud mouth cat loves it.
review/text: My Cat is coming up on his 13th year and suddenly when we are home he never stops yowling. There is nothing wrong with him medically, he just began demanding an insane amount of attention (he already gets more attention than most children) and begs for food even when he is not hungry because he wants you to come in the kitchen and pay attention to him. So as much as I love incessant meowing while I am trying to read, type, talk or think.....<br /><br />Anywho we didn't want to reward the yowling with treats or feeding him at times other than his normal meals but ignoring the behavior as per the vet and other people instructed simply did not work. After months of his crying we chalked it up to old age and wound up just giving him treats and snacks of his wet food so we could have a phone conversation without the person on the other line thinking we were killing our animal. He mostly ignored the extra food and would gobble up the treats but we knew it wasn't a perma fix. So we tried the cat milk. He loves it. Laps it up like me at a $2 martini happy hour. It appears to have a soothing effect on him because he stops meowing for a while after he gets it. Plus we feed him premium food and he was still a little flaky. (I think due to the dry heat in our home) The cat milk seems to help with the flakiness and his coat seems smoother. I would definitely limit it to a small serving once a day, I gave him a leetle too much when I first got it and I paid for it the next day when I was scooping the box. Other than the one incident it actually seems to help his poop. cheers!

review/summary: Saved my cat's life
review/text: My cat kept getting sick and refusing to eat.  He would go anorexic and become lethargic I had to keep taking him to the vet.  The last time it was so bad that he was put on IV's for dehydration.  He also had a high fever and some other weird stuff going on.  I was really afraid he was not going to live very long (he was only about 4 years old).  After he was back home from the vets and feeling better, it started up again within a week.  He stopped eating and became lethargic.  My husband bought Whiskas Milk because we were trying to get him to at least drink something.  I was going to bottle feed him if I had to, but as soon as he sniffed the Whiskas Milk, he cleaned out the dish and he has not been sick since then and it has been about 2 years.  I give him a small amount several times a week or whenever he asks for it.  There must be some kind of nutrition in it that he needed that he was not getting.  If I forget to give it to him, he'll meow in a different tone so I know he wants it.  It's really a miracle, he went from being a very sick cat to very healthy.  I have not taken him to the vets since I started giving him the milk.  My other two cats who are healthy will not drink it at all, but that's okay, they don't need it.

She likes it cold from the fridge, I keep it in an empty pb jar and use disposable paper bowls, because she begs for it all day.

review/summary: Try Cat-Sip Real Milk
review/text: I bought this one time when PetSmart was out of Cat-Sip Real Milk. My cats wouldn't even try it. They ran up to it excitedly, expecting it to be Cat-Sip. They each sniffed it, and literally turned their noses up! Then they just walked away. It didn't go to waste as my dogs were excited to have it. Passed the dog taste test, but that doesn't mean much. After reading the ingredients, I probably shouldn't have even fed it to my dogs. Full of random stuff: guar gum, corn syrup solids...just to name a couple. And it is completely watered down too. I'm going to stick with Cat-Sip, and I recommend you try that brand as well. Cat-Sip has only 3 ingredients; low fat milk, lactase enzyme (to help the cats break down the dairy as cats are naturally lactose intolerant), and taurine (an essential nutrient for cats). Also, Cat-Sip is usually a few cents cheaper than the Wiskas stuff!

review/summary: overpriced, full of fillers
review/text: After buying this once, I realized how full of junk it was, like hydrogenated oil, thickeners like guar gum, and corn syrup solids, plus stuff I can't spell, let alone pronounce.  So now I just buy lactaid milk and it works fine.<br /><br />I was hoping for something that had extra vitamins in it and maybe omega-3s, but no such luck. Whiskas missed an opportunity here.<br /><br />Update:  I've upgraded my kitten lactaid milk to include taurine from capsules (jarrow), and whey based amino acid digest, I think it's called Amino Gold or something, meant for sports people.  I also add a little bit of "miralax" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OZGG0K">Kirkland LaxaClear, 90 Daily Doses, Polyethylene Glycol 3350 (3 Pack), Compare to Miralax Active Ingredient</a> but only a little bit.  Of all these things, I add a tiny tiny bit.  My cats weigh about 10 lbs each, so figure 20 lbs of feeding, that's about 1/5 of a 100 lb teenager.  I also water it down about 1:3 parts water:lactaid.<br /><br />They LOVE it, beg for it.  Two cups of it is gone in a day.  Be prepared to clean the litterbox every night though.  But it's good for them to be hydrated.  I haven't decided how to get more Omega-3 into this yet.  Maybe add almond milk?  They seem to like almonds and are after me if I eat them.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001VKIK0">Jarrow Formulas Taurine 1,000mg Capsules, 100-Count</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GJZV86">Ultimate Nutrition Amino Gold Capsules, 1000 mg, 250-Count Bottles</a><br /><br />They drink it between meals.<br />Did I mention cats like parmesan cheese?  I'm considering adding parmesan as a flavorant to make it even more irresistible.

review/summary: Better than "real" milk
review/text: As most cats can not digest the lactose in real milk this is a great substitute if you want to give your cat a milk like treat.  I have one cat who loves to play in the water dish but is not really found of drinking it.  As he eats a predominately dry diet this ensures he gets an adequate amount of fluids each day.  I also use this when giving liquid medicine.  It is easy to mix a liquid medicine into this and as all 3 of my cats like this product it is much easier to give meds this way than to fight with a cat that doesn't want a syringe in it's mouth.

review/text: My 7 month old kitten loves this milk! He actually begs for it every single day at the same exact time each day, sometimes more but I only give it to him once a day.  There are 3 to 4 servings in each little container and he really seems to like it. Even though cats have a love for milk,they are actually lactose intolerant, because they don't have the lactase enzyme(which I believe is present at birth). This milk is specially formulated, just like the milk for people who have lactose intolerance so it doesn't give them an upset stomach. This product is definitely worth trying!

review/summary: Save yoursefl some money and use lactaid
review/text: Most cats have a hard time digesting cows' milk, as much as they love it.  The problem is the lactose, and Whiskas Catmilk is a reduced lactose milk product with taurine and other vitamins added.<br /><br />Cats need taurine.  Most mammals can make their own, but cats can't.  They have to eat taurine.  However, powdered taurine is cheap, and you can find it right here on Amazon.  These little boxes of brown milk will cost you more per ounce than grass fed organic milk costs.  For me, it makes sense to keep them handy, because my geyser cat can keep this stuff down when no other food product will stay in her, and that keeps her out of a fatty liver crisis.  But if what you are trying to accomplish is as simple as giving your cat who eats normal food a treat?  Try having a carton of lactaid on hand.

review/summary: Smaller package, still 200mL
review/text: The picture on the product page still shows the older, rectangular packaging. What arrived was 24 of the new, smaller containers but they hold the same amount of Whiskas Cat Milk. I applaud Whiskas for reducing the packaging but, since I'm a bit slow, I ordered this based on the picture of the old rectangular boxes. My local store started carrying the new packs and I, without bothering to read the fine print, thought they were selling less product for the same price. I'm glad I did though because this was a great buy (of course I now have over a 6 month supply but the "Best By" date is beyond the 6 months).<br /><br />I started giving this to my little IBS kitty every day because she was on a course of medicine that, although it was supposed to be tuna flavored, she wouldn't take. I mixed it into the Cat Milk and she lapped it up. After we'd finished up the medicine, she still asked for her Cat Milk treat so now I give it to her while I dish out everyone's canned food. It's a perfect distraction 'cause she used to try to "help" and be in the way "testing" each bowl as I dished out the canned food. I guess you could say the Cat Milk is a bribe but either the medicine worked or the Cat Milk helped (or both) 'cause she's put back on the weight she'd lost during her last Irritable Bowl bout (and when my vet weighed her he said keep on doing whatever it is you're doing).

review/summary: Oh Whiskas, how your quality suffers.
review/text: The charming picture on the box was reminiscent of the more special momments in your childhood. Unfortunately, the crude sludge contained within was not as enjoyable. With an odor which served only to offend my delicate nasal passages, slightly akin to that of burning vaseline. The taste was generally harsh, and burned my palate. A taste which one could only relate to stale nachos and burning pig ovaries. The texture could only be comparable to liquified chalk, with a hint of sand. An after taste of goat rectum and pepto bismal lingered in my throat, only going away with copious amounts of whiskey. I denounce this drink. Avoid.<br /><br /> -My cat on the other hand loves the stuff.

And blowing bubbles is my favorite thing to do.  And this is by far the most bestest gum to blow blubblies with.  I do it all day long... especially around other people.  I kid.

review/summary: Favorite mustard ever
review/text: I grew up in Western New York and when I moved I realized that this is only available in WNY.  Thank God for the internet!  This mustard is superb, by far my favorite mustard ever.  I've gotten my friends hooked on it and my husband and his family hooked on it.  I buy multiple jars when I visit home and bring them back for a list that keeps growing larger and larger every time I go.  Using Weber's Horseradish Mustard in a potato salad will really make the potato salad stand out from others.  In fact, substituting this mustard for any mustard in a recipe will make the recipe come to life and add additional flavor to it.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this mustard!

Its great on ham or salami or any hearty cold cuts and it shines with grilled hot dogs or Polish sausage.  It is also a terrific secret ingredient in deviled eggs and potato salad.  Its bright atomic yellow color may make you think of French's, but that is where the similarity ends...this condiment packs a punch!

review/text: I've made my own bread for the past 40+ yrs and potato bread was as close to plain white bread as I ever got. I loved making it, loved eating it and loved knowing it was made from scratch with quality ingredients for my family (a husband and 5 kids) . Now after years of illness, I just cant do it all myself. I have trusted Bob's Red Mill for many years for the healthy ingredients in my breads so it was only natural that I turned to them for a bread mix to make life easier for me now. It's so easy to make in my food processor and I can have fresh bread in less time than finding a ride to the grocery store! And for less money, too!<br /><br />This dough is also great for rolls. The other day I made piroskies and they were awesome!

I have a split pot so I use this and the plain version for hot potting (half on each side. We always keep the soup for the day after so we can make noodles. It's just that good.<br /><br />TIPS:<br />Don't add all of the dry hot peppers at once. Add a couple, wait 5 min, taste the soup, add if you need more. I made the mistake of adding everything the first time around and regretted it.<br />For the oil, don't use it all at once. Pour some then add as you go because it'll grab onto the food and disappear from the pot as you go.

review/text: First of all, they are very convenient to use. You just boil them with hot water, then you can put whatever you want into the pot, and it does taste good as well. Especially in the cold weather, you want your food to be warm all the time. It takes about 15 minutes to prepare the hot pot for up to 4 people. They do not really sell this in typical Asian market. So I was happy to get it online with free shipping. As for the price, it cost about 5 dollars a pack in the store (if you can find it). So plus the tax you would pay, this online purchase is not bad.

When I met my wife there she took me to Little Sheep for the first time, and when we came back to the states were were absolutely thrilled to find that their ingredients was packaged and for sale here in the US so you can have it at home.<br /><br />We like the spicy package (red). Sliced lamb is a necessity, that's how they serve it in China. Also with firm tofu, luncheon meat (in a can like spam), bamboo shoots, rice sticks, daikon radish, spinach, asian mushrooms and so much more. It is great in the winter when it's really cold outside to have the hot pot boiling at the table. We also serve it with "Sa Cha" sauce.<br /><br />Mmmmmm, this is REAL Chinese, not like the garbage sold in all the Chinese restaurants here in America.

review/text: If you like dark chocolate combined with the sweet peanut butter taste, you should enjoy these peanut butter cups. To my taste the dark chocolate exterior acts as a foil to the peanut taste inside and accents it better than the milk chocolate. Bought these for the holidays and my sons and friends liked the chocolate also. They disappeared quickly. Dark chocolate is healthier for you than milk chocolate. It would be helpful to know what percent dark cocoa the coating of these are as nutritionists recommend above 70%. These are a great after-dinner or mid-afternoon treat.<br /><br />If you like dark chocolate and you like Reese's peanut butter cups, you should enjoy this tasty combination.

review/text: I had long been a fan of Lindt's line of chocolates, similar in size and shape to these. However, Godiva's "Gems" are much superior, I have discovered. The taste is much richer, and Godiva chocolate has an extra something to it that other chocolates simply don't. The individual chocolates themselves are smaller than their Lindt brethren, but perhaps this is a good thing for those of us that have difficulty controlling cravings.<br /><br />A 4oz bag such as this contains 12 chocolates, so the price is a bit steep. However, it is unlikely that they sell for less anywhere else, so if you are in the market for nice chocolates, these are a good option.

review/text: Buying a pack of 5 was very reasonable.  I included some in gift baskets and kept two for myself.  It's really easy to tear off the top, put your steaks/pork chops/chicken in the bag, seal, and let marinade in the fridge until ready to cook.  In the stores an individual packet sells for $4 and $5.  I'd definitely purchase a pack of 5 from Amazon.com again!

review/summary: Best of the marinades
review/text: We have used this marinade for some time now, but lately we cannot find it anywhere in this town.  The best marinade for flank steak ever, but I would recommend letting it sit overnight.  Not too sweet, not too soy sauce salty, just right.

review/summary: An excellent maranade!
review/text: It's become increasingly difficult to find these maranade packs at the local grocery stores, so I was extremely happy to find them here on Amazon!<br /><br />We like to maranade Tri-Tip in this Honey Teriyaki maranade.  These maranader bags are so convenient - just open up the bag, fill it up with Tri-Tip, close the bag, knead it a little bit to make sure the maranade is well distributed and reaches all of the meat, let it sit in the fridge for awhile and when you're ready to cook simply put the meat on the grill directly from the bag and toss out the bag.  No mess, no fuss.<br /><br />We've used the other Jack Daniel's marader flavors, and this is the one we like the best.

review/summary: NOT a good flavoring!
review/text: I tried this extract in several types of baked goods and was dissapointed every time. There seemed to be no flavor at all! I eventually used 4 tsp in a sugar cookie recipe and STILL could not discern any flavor hazelnut or otherwise! I tried it in a simple sugar and milk glaze thinking perhaps cooking had influenced the flavor. There was only the slightest vaguely bitter taste to the glaze. There was no flavor, pleasant or otherwise in anything I tried this product in.

review/summary: Hardcore Dairy Man
review/text: I've been eating ice cream for over 50 years, and the thought of non-dairy "ice cream" didn't appeal to me, until I tried your product... Amazing! How in the world did you get a nut-based non-dairy product to taste like ice cream? I followed the directions on the label and let the Ice Supreme sit a while at room temperature, and get "spoon soft," Fabulous! As I get older, I'm paying more attention to what I put into my body, and it's a joy to read an ingredient label that does not have the multi-syllable additives, preservatives, and other hard to pronounce chemicals. Just old fashion all natural ingredients like grandma would use. Thanks for such a great product, my favorite being "Pecan Passion." The whole pecans on top are like a gift. Thanks again.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: I grew up in Louisiana, and I have had a lifelong love for Community Coffee. The Evangeline blend manages to be both robust and refined, as compared to some of the other Community offerings and remains our family favorite. The beans delivered through Amazon have a nice, freshly-roasted aroma, when you open that bag. They make a great espresso when correctly ground, and of course make a wonderful "French Press" made coffee.<br /><br />Our preferred method is to mix about 1/3 of these ground with the regular Community pre-ground Dark Roast in the French Press, and it gives us coffee that even "most" of our Texas friends enjoy.<br /><br />I'd recommend unless you are accustomed to European or Louisiana-style coffee, you cut back on the amount of this powerful but subtle coffee at first, and gradually increase the amount of coffee you use until you hit your "sweet spot".<br /><br />As a "lagniappe", I'll also offer my quick version of Cafe Brulot, and this coffee makes a great basis for it. There are many recipes around, but mine comes from the memory of watching a waiter make it some 40 years ago in a fine New Orleans restaurant. Into a caraffe, place 4 tsp turbinado sugar, 2 jiggers Cherry Heering Liqueur, 2 jiggers cognac, and 4 jiggers of Grand Marnier liqueur. Add 6-8 cups of strong, hot coffee, stir, and serve, toping each cup with a tbsp of whipped cream. How many this recipe serves depends on just how marvelous you want your day to start or your evening to end. It's great after a fine meal and while talking with friends or listening to good music. Keep any reserve over a low heat for a second cup.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

review/summary: Scrumptious dark chocolate
review/text: I've sampled multiple  brands of dark chocolate and so far my two favorites are this brand and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKV7Q0">Green & Black's</a>. This chocolate is simply scrumptious. It has just the right level of sweetness, and its texture is smooth and creamy.<br /><br />Over the last four years there have been dozens of scientific studies analyzing and confirming substantial health benefits from a small amount of dark chocolate consumed daily. The original German studies in 2007 that indicated the healing properties of dark chocolate used this particular brand. The latest findings from a Harvard study released in early 2011 indicate that as little as 6 gm. of dark chocolate (about 30 calories) is a sufficient daily "dose." That is equivalent to one of the tiny squares of this chocolate.<br /><br />The health benefits of dark chocolate are due to the flavonoids contained in cocoa. Flavonoids act as antioxidants in the body, which both prevent and reduce inflammation. Over many years of medical research, inflammation has been found to contribute to or directly cause a host of diseases, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and cancer, as well as autoimmune diseases like arthritis.<br /><br />Flavonoids are found in the pigments of fruits and vegetables which give them their color. The darker and deeper the color of a fruit or vegetable, the greater the amount of flavonoids it contains. Cocoa is derived from the dark-brown cacao bean, which is the fruit of the tropical tree, theobroma cacao. In any chocolate product, such as this one, the higher the percentage of cocoa/cacao, the more flavonoids the chocolate contains.<br /><br />Dark chocolate such as this product is better for your health than milk chocolate because it contains more antioxidants, which are good for you, and less sugar, which is not good for you--especially if you have diabetes or are struggling with your weight.

review/summary: From a Yank's prespective.
review/text: After seeing this on every sitcom table in the UK I had to try it.<br /><br />Made by everyone's favorite Ketchup King Heinz...  HP Sauce pushes the vinegar to the forefront when compared to Ketchup.  Your mouth twinges with the tang of vinegar upon eating this... then you taste the sweetness from the tomato/sugars.  There was also a subtle sweet taste that was somewhat different then Ketchup... which I think is most likely from the dates looking over the ingredients.<br /><br />I was really expecting somthing more like A1 then Ketchup... but I really don't know where I picked up that preconception. Overall I enjoyed it; people into vinegar chips or whatever would really get a kick out of this.

review/summary: Good sauce.........
review/text: We have used this sauce for several years. It is not like any of the sauces made in the USA. A wonderful change from the sweet ketchup that most USA people love & use. HP sauce is for  those who like a little more zap in & on the food. It is not like salsa or chili sauce with it's zap. A nice product, try it.  It's not like A1 or Heinz 57 sauce either.

review/text: My wife, who was from Cornwall, GB, introduced me to HP sauce. It is head and shoulders over all other steak sauces. It is rarely found on supermarket shelves.  The specialty British food store in NYC which always carries HP Sauce is 130 miles away.  Since about everything in the world usually can be found on Amazon I typed in  Amazon.Com and found suppliers.  I now have a year's supply.  Thank you, Amazon.

review/text: I was sceptical of this sauce, that is to say , I wasn't sure I liked it, even after trying it for the first time. However, I kept trying it on various meats and so forth,...and found it was great on fried chicken. Try it on most anything now ...and really dig it.  Way to go Keith !  Good call !

review/summary: I Love the sweet/sour taste in General
review/text: I have to say that I might be a biased customer, because I raised with this thing :) I used it for many recipes. It last for a long time and it is delivered in a glass container which is the cleanest way of saving food in my opinion.
