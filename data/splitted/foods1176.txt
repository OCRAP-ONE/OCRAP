review/summary: Any real peanuts in the bar?
review/text: I just had my first bar drawn from our kitchen cupboard. It was the Oats and Peanut Butter bar.  I was attracted by the full-sized peanuts on the package photo.  About halfway through I realized that I hadn't yet tasted a peanut.  Even the peanut butter flavor was pretty weak.  Looking back at the package I realized that the photographer had placed full sized peanuts in the photo to make it LOOK like they were part of the bar.  Old time deceptive advertising.  You wouldn't think they'd need to do that still.  But then, we are easily fooled... aren't we?

review/summary: Compare with any other product
review/text: I state that you can compare, as I have, and for the money and taste and freshness, Fiber One bars are the best in quality.If it cost less, check the fiber content of how many grams of fiber, and thats the answer. You need to eat two bars, or close, to equal one Fiber One bars grams of fiber.<br /><br />I tried a less expensive bar at Amazon and the taste made me gag.I bought three cases and the product was very stale.All that waste of money for garbage.<br /><br />I am staying with my tried and true best value Fiber One.

review/summary: Best granola bars I've ever had!
review/text: The Fiber One Oats & Chocolate granola bars are the best granola bars I've ever had -- I guess that's clear since I'm willing to buy a 12-pack.  In my opinion the Chocolate flavor is the best, and I've tried them all (the Peanut Butter is okay but not great, and the Caramel is waaay too sweet and tastes more like butterscotch).  The bars are chewy and not at all dry, and there's tons of chocolate!  Feels like an indulgent sweet treat, but you're getting 9 grams of fiber.  Yes, they are more calories than other granola bars like Quaker (140 cals vs. ~100 cals), but you get way more nutritious value, a better taste, and a more satisfying snack out of it.  What's not to love!

review/summary: Good Tasting Oats Bars
review/text: Most health bars taste awful. Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate is not bad at all. A little chewy, but it does not crumble when you bite it while other snack bars shatters to hundreds of pieces of crumbs. This one you can enjoy even if you are in front of your computer keyboard.<br />I like the Fiber One  Granola Bars Oats & Caramel better as the chocolate tends to be a  little bit too sweet.  Also kinda small for my satisfaction.

I've called Amazon about this a few times and cannot get anyone in the USA. The out of Country people just don't get the problem. If I suscribe to save, how can you be "out of stock?" Don't they pre-order for those that have the subscriptions? I just cancelled, they are cheaper at Sams & Costco anyway and ALWAYS in stock. Beware of this subscribe & save....you'll save all right since you won't get this. Down to a 1 star for customer service, 5 stars for taste.<br />These bars are chewy, sweet, delicious and loaded with fiber too! If you love chocolate, you can't go wrong buying this flavor of Fiber One Bars. These make a quick meal, a snack after exercising, dessert or just ue as an addition to your fiber intake. Be careful, they become addictive and it's easy to eat another one...

review/text: After reviewing some photos of me with my shirt off after a vacation I realized that I needed to loose some weight.  I heard fiber increases metabolism so I started buying these.  I've tried a few different brands, but these tasted the best to me.  I ended up loosing 30lbs in a month and a half by eating two of these a day, and taking soda out of my diet.  I went from 195lbs to 165lbs.  Fiber Works!  What better way to loose weight than to eat something that tastes like a treat in itself too!

Maybe people's bodies are used to the amount of fiber? Fiber does help "clean out" your system. Its the perfect breakfast food for me: tastes great, easy to grab n go, and pretty healthy. I also will eat one when I am craving some chocolate. So much better for you than a candy bar.

review/summary: Good and good for you!
review/text: I grew up eating pop tarts and cereal bars, nutri grain bars, nature valley bars, and all the other crap out there.  I promise you, nothing can compare to these fiber bars, they are so delicious I just crave them, and they have a ton of fiber in them (obviously) 9 grams I believe.  Compare that to the other bars I just mentioned, they usually have only 1, at most 2.  Fiber is very important, a fiber-rich diet can lead to a much longer life and prevent many forms of cancer.  Most health food I would agree lacks taste and substance for me, but not this.  I eat these everyday and I'm still not sick of them, and they keep me full until lunch(sometimes I may have a banana to go with it).  At first my girlfriend would not try these she said they were nasty (even though she hadn't tried them) and she continued to buy and eat Quaker Oats breakfast bars, which have the nutritional equivalent of chalk.  Finally I got her to try these and she has been hooked ever since.  They're covered in chocolate, and have a very sweet taste, but they are not high in sugar.<br /><br />So in conclusion.  I don't care if you're on a diet or not everyone should start eating these, now I'm just wondering when they are going to come out with Fiber One bread so I can make super healthy tasty sandwiches or Fiber One cookies so I don't have to feel bad about having dessert...who's with me?

review/summary: Dieter's Dream
review/text: If you are on a diet or looking to cut calories and fat, Fiber One's line of snack bars will be a dream come true. The chocolate and caramel ones are on the sweet side, so go for Peanut Butter if you can't handle such a sweet taste. I don't care for the apple flavored ones because of their plastic, fake taste and haven't tried strawberry.<br />These bars contain 35% of your RDA for fiber which is great! They should not give you digestion issues unless you get very little fiber normally or if you eat more than one a day. But do pay attention to the ingredient and nutrition lists. This is not health food! They are high in sugar, carbs, and have ingredients like shellac, ethanol, and hydrogenated oil. This is junk food that happens to have some redeeming qualities.<br />5 stars for taste and 3 for health factors. Overall, I give it a 4.

review/summary: Good taste, texture, nutrition
review/text: One of the better bars I've found in terms of price, taste, texture, and nutrition.  I've been eating them as "emergency snacks" as my pregancy progresses, and they do a good job.  I really like that I'm getting a good portion of my daily fiber requirement (extra important for expectant mothers) in one serving: this is hard to do with highly processed "bar" type foods.  And I like the fact it tastes like an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie rather than a sawdust or twig-textured health food.<br />I noticed one customer said they made her sick: if you're not used to getting much fiber in your diet, jumping straight to your recommended daily allowance without a careful ramp up is quite likely to cause gastro-intestional distress.

review/text: These things are awesome. If you weren't told they had fiber, you wouldn't know it. They taste just like junk food should - but they're good for you, and relatively healthy. Just don't eat the whole box in one sitting - they aren't kidding when they say each bar has 35% of your daily fiber allotment. If you eat two, you're at 70%, and since today's processed/fast-food culture makes us lucky to hit 50% RDA for fiber, you WILL experience gastro-intestinal upset. If you get the munchies, hit the chips, not the fiber bars.

review/summary: Great taste, very filling, and lots of fiber
review/text: I love these Fiber One Bars Oats and Chocolate.  They're very tasty and satisfy my chocolate craving.  Granted, these aren't the most healthy thing in the world, but given that my other breakfast options are either a) no breakfast, b) the drive thru with the shortest line on my way to work, or c) Pop Tarts, they're far healthier than my own personal alternatives.  They're chewy, sweet and easily portable (a huge plus for a busy worker and student).<br /><br />I generally get far, far less of the daily recommended fiber, so this was a fantastic way for me to increase my fiber intake and actually eat breakfast most mornings.  I actually found that eating one of these in the morning along with a big bottle of water spiked with some sort of calorie free flavoring (like Crystal Light) kept me very full until lunch, and sometimes later.  So I wasn't contemplating eating my keyboard by lunchtime anymore.<br /><br />At 140 calories per bar, they aren't super low in calories.  But I've also tried a number of the 100-calorie bars with flavors like Oreo, Chips Ahoy, etc, and the Fiber One Oats & Chocolate are larger, more filling, way higher in fiber, and taste a lot better, all for only 40 more calories.  It does contain 4 g of fat, with 1.5 g of that as saturated (bad) fat.  On the plus side, it does have 1.5 g of monounsaturated (good) fat, no cholesterol and is low in sodium (only 90 mg or 4% RDA).<br /><br />The main pro for me has been the 40 pounds lost that a healthier diet and exercise helped me to achieve, and Fiber One has been a part of that healthier diet.  These are certainly healthier than my usual morning routine; I could only eat 3/4 of ONE Pop-Tart for the same number of calories (and be honest, who ever only eats even one of the Pop Tarts in the little foil pack?  Not me, I always eat both, so one of these bars is approximately 1/3 the number of calories as the two-pack of Pop Tarts, with 9 times more filling fiber).<br /><br />I never had the gas or upset stomach problem that others have mentioned on here, and I usually have a pretty sensitive digestive system.  If you don't usually eat much fiber, there is the off chance that you'll have a few less than pleasant reactions to increasing your fiber.  I had no such problems, and have learned that the increased fiber makes me fuller longer than pure carbs like Pop Tarts and that my digestive system seems to be working better now that I'm getting an extra boost of fiber.  Give them a try and see how they work for you!<br /><br />My diabetic dad and I both love these.  My dad has not noticed any significant impact on his blood sugar levels or how he feels after eating these, and they're so good that he sometimes eats two or three at a time.  He calls them his candy bars.<br /><br />In terms of flavor, the chocolate is my favorite.  I don't like peanut butter in anything, but I guess that flavor is okay if you like peanut butter.  I don't like the apple or the strawberry; they're too chewy and don't actually taste like fruit in any way.  The caramel was okay, but almost too sweet for me (and that's hard to accomplish!).  I haven't tried the mocha because I don't like coffee either.  The chocolate is great though, it does taste almost like a chocolate bar and is very yummy for chocoholics like me!<br /><br />So, overall, I highly recommend that you give these a try.  I've found these bars to be fabulous, and I stock up when they go on sale because I know that I will (eventually) eat them all.  I keep a couple in my purse, car, and desk drawer- you never known when you're going to get stuck working through lunch or sitting in traffic until Doomsday.

And on top of that, I was at work, orchestrating a cacophony of trumpet piercing farts in the acoustically optimal office restroom. I had to sit on the toilet about 8 times that day and by the end of the night, the mucosa of my rectum was prolapsing out of my anus. It was burning down there as if I had an enema with a pint of Tabasco sauce. If you insist on eating these, be sure you are alone and at home.

review/summary: Trip #10 to the toilet after one bar, WATCH OUT!
review/text: A co-worker left these in the breakroom. I ate one up, boy was it delicious. Within 90 minutes I had to go to the bathroom, it has continued all day. Gastric Distress to the max! I read the wrapper, it has 9 grams of fiber. If you are not a large consumer of fiber in your diet, I say eat 1/3 of a bar and stop. See what happens. Due to the unexpected results I had to give this a one star. No wonder the bars were up for grabs in the breakroom! I wonder who else in the office is suffering.

review/text: At roughly 55 cents (subscribed price) per unit, I unfortunately found out (too late) that this was at least 20 cents more than my local grocery store. I called Amazon and there was nothing they would do about it. I suggest checking out pricing at your local grocery store prior to purchasing this item. Don't make the same mistake I did. Its a good product, but sadly overpriced on Amazon.com

review/summary: Fiber: 1, Farts: 20
review/text: This product is known to give people gas.  I actually counted over a period of several days and each bar caused me to fart 18-22 times from four to six hours after I ate it.  If you live alone or are on cipro for athrax exposure and your intestines are sterile, maybe you can live with that side effect.  Otherwise, it's better to give to someone as a joke than to eat yourself.<br /><br />Other than that, it tastes pretty good if not too sweet.<br /><br />Additional comments 17 months after my above review:<br /><br />First, let me state on their box General Mills had plenty of room to educate about different fiber sources while promoting the variety of fiber products they produce.<br /><br />I had a chance to try Target's generic competitor to this food product and found the same stinkin' results.<br /><br />Using Wikipedia (yes a printed dictionary would be more reliable) I see that the main ingredient of these products, called "Chicory Root Extract", is full of an indigestible sugar called inulin that ferments into gas in your large intestine. Inulin is no doubt responsible for the too-sweet taste of the bars that I mentioned in my first review 17 months ago.<br /><br />Another vegetable containing inulin is the Jerusalem Artichoke for which Wikipedia has the following snippet:<br />Gerard's Herbal, printed in 1621, quotes the English planter John Goodyer on Jerusalem artichokes:<br />"which way soever they be dressed and eaten, they stir and cause a filthy loathsome stinking<br />wind within the body, thereby causing the belly to be pained and tormented, and are a meat more<br />fit for swine than men."<br /><br />Ergo I conclude Fiber One bars are more fit for swine than men. If people knew that in year 1621, why is General Mills putting out an inulin-filled product now? And why in all their biased, pro-fiber packaging is there not a single mention of the gastrointestinal side effects known to effect a large swath of the population for almost 400 years?  Corporate food scientists don't just throw random boxes from the undesirable vegetable dispensary into a stew, and somehow get instant FDA approval and national distribution channels, folks.

review/summary: Taste Awful
review/text: I have tried and enjoyed the Fiber One 90 Calorie Chocolate bars, so I thought I would try these Oats and Chocolate bars since they were on sale.  After making my way through two boxes (I usually eat one a day as a snack).  At this point, I can't eat anymore.  The taste is just bad.  It's not disgusting or anything, but they do not taste good by any means.  I can only handle eating one a week now, or have one daily and always have something else better to eat right afterward.  Oats and Chocolate made me think I was going to get something that tasted like Quaker Granola Bars.  That is not the case, I don't even know that chocolate is an ingredient.  They just taste bad.  Try the Fiber One 90 Calorie Chocolate bars - somehow, the healthier bars taste better.

review/text: Per doctors orders, I am trying to add more fiber to my diet.  I purchased these with high hopes after reading all the positive reviews.  The texture is a lot like sawdust and cardboard mixed with chocolate chips.  I could not choke it down without a full 20 ounces of water.  I know you are supposed to increase your water intake with a high fiber diet, but I dont want to have to eat something where I feel like I am gagging on it.  These are going into the office slush bag of food no one would eat unless desperate.

review/summary: Save your grater
review/text: I started using Boyajian citrus oils years ago upon the recommendation of a professional baker/chef when I was making my daughter's wedding cake.  Now I use them in almost anything I would normally grate zest into, or I just use a fraction of the zest for the visual appeal.  NOTE: THIS IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR LEMON JUICE.  Otherwise, a few drops of the oil is plenty to impart the tang of real lemon to most recipes.  It can last for years if kept refrigerated. Having the bottles of oil on-hand is a huge money, time and space saver;  I no longer have to buy and store the fruit, or as much of it, and I don't have to take the time to grate it.  Concentrated, intense, delicious!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002A603ZY">Pure LEMON Oil (Boyajian) 148ml (5 oz)</a>

review/summary: Half wasted
review/text: My dogs refuse to eat the light green hard side of these treats. They do enjoy the soft dark green side, but they easily eat off that part and leave over the other side completely. The two sides aren't as 'together' as they look on the package, and it is super easy for my little dogs to pull off the soft side. I have never successfully been able to get either of my dogs to eat the whole thing, and I the other half is just completely wasted. These treats do smell really good, and might be good for a bigger dog that will just eat the whole thing instead of separating it. However, I would not recommend these treats as my dogs are NOT picky eaters and if they reject the light green hard side, I have a feeling most dogs won't like it. Considering the price, it just isn't worth it if the dogs will only eat half.

It is extremely portable and mixes easily (I almost turned away from stevia because I tried the powder form first). The taste is as subtle or strong as you like. Some people may take some time to adjust to the taste and find the right amount for their tastes but it is worth trying as it has no blood sugar effect and no side effects (ie aspartame). I get the subscription price at amazon and this is way below the lowest price I've found.

And the slight vanilla flavor makes my coffee delicious.  In fact, when I go to my favorite coffee house, the coffee doesn't taste "right" to me until I add a dropper full of this Vanilla Creme stevia.<br /><br />I keep one bottle at home, one bottle at work, and one bottle in my purse...so anytime I want coffee, I am ready.  The price here on Amazon can't be beat, so I will be buying it here from now on.

review/summary: Sharper taste than expected, unless heated
review/text: I prefer Splenda or xylitol for baking because neither adds the bitterness I find in stevia, but sometimes use liquid stevia for sweetening other things - especially my morning oatmeal, which is what I wanted the "vanilla creme" stevia for.  Since a dietician has persuaded me to add textured vegetable protein to my oatmeal to add some protein to my breakfast, I have to flavor it with something or it tastes like dog kibble.  This stuff plus some cinnamon really helps breakfast to taste pretty good again.<br /><br />I do find it's best when added to the water before the oatmeal is microwaved.  When used to sweeten oatmeal that's already cooked, it has that sharp stevia aftertaste and I was wondering where the "creme" in its "vanilla creme" name comes from.  But cooking makes a big difference - it's just fine after cooking along with the oatmeal.  I haven't tried using it with anything else.

review/summary: VANILLA STEVIA VERY CONCENTRATED
review/text: I have purchased this sweetener for the second time now, I do not use it all the time or on everything, but I use it often enough esp. when I am trying to cut back on agave or other high glycemic sweeteners. Its flavor does not always work with coffee, but it does if you also add a bit of the usual sweetener you use. It works well on: yogurt, hot cereal, cold cereal, hot chocolate milk (home made). It is concentrated ergo economical, but I find I use more of it after I get used to the taste again, on cereal I sometimes go up to almost a dropper full, esp. with cinnamon or pumpkin spices which blend well with this sweetener. I like the idea that I am cutting back on sugar and also the vanilla flavor improves the stevia taste for an unaccostumed palate. Saying one gets used to the stevia flavor is very subjective, as even for me there are days I just do not want this taste and others I am OK with it. Again, my method to use it except on hot cereal and yogurt where it works fine, is to add just a little of another sweetener, or conversely, support the overall sweetness of a liquid drink with about three drops of this stevia mix when I want to cut back on sugary type sweeteners. The tongue experiences different sweeteners in various ways, and I just like to have this on hand always, as inevitably, I use it either with another sweetener or straight with cinnamon type spices. Be careful to start with very little it gets very intense and off flavor fast, and if you just dose it right it will taste fine. Less is more -- you can always add a drop at a time as needed. Once you find your approximate "dose" -- mine is like three drops in liquids max or the flavors just go south for me... and a half dropper on solid foods - but I do like my things pretty sweet. With proper experimentation and without instant rejection of the flavors, mostly due to using too much product, this can become a staple in your home too.

review/summary: It will do.
review/text: It is difficult to review food items because everyone has taste preferences that vary.  I purchased this because I wanted some sort of sweetener for my coffee that would not affect my blood sugars. I found the flavoring to be a bit overpowering.  I ended up using less than the recommended amount.  I only use one drop in my coffee. I would suggest you start with one drop and then taste and adjust accordingly.<br /><br />To me the vanilla flavor tastes artificial but you can't find any information on the label other that it contains "natural" flavoring.<br /><br />But it does what it promises which is to sweeten and flavor. It will also last for a long time since only drops are used.

review/summary: Good but...
review/text: Maybe my expectations were too high. Heeding the warnings about adding too much I started with 8 oz of bottled seltzer and added a few drops. The taste was more of a hint than a true flavoring so I added a little more, figuring if I got the taste I liked I'd start from scratch and get a better measurement. It never happened for me. When I added enough to create some flavor I also found an aftertaste that was somewhat alcohol-y. Not a problem for most people but I strongly dislike the taste of alcohol so it's not good for me. Played with it some more and never got a satisfactory result. Into the fridge, back of the shelf.<br /><br />A couple of weeks later I came home with some diet orange soda. Thought I'd try it again and see if I could make some orange cream soda and voila! Delicious. I say this having only tried one 8 oz serving and I made it a little too sweet but I have no doubt that once I get the ratio correct I'll add this to any orange soda I drink from now on. I'll probably try it with other flavors too altho orange seems to be the sure thing.

I hate Stevia in the powder form, but, the liquid is great and so convenient.  I particularly like the Vanilla flavor the best because it is fabulous in so many things such as coffee, pancakes, sparkling water (makes it like creme soda) and so much more.  I highly recommend it.  I'm not crazy about Chocolate Rasberry and the Lemon Drop is ok.  The Valencia Orange is great in water.

review/summary: Tastes Delicous but made my belly hurt
review/text: I discovered Stevia about a year ago (around the same time I found out I had to give up sugar!) and really I like the taste of stevia so much I don't even miss sugar...okay well maybe I miss sugar a little bit but eliminating sugar from my diet would of been much more difficult if it weren't for stevia.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of is that many stevia products have an ingredient called xylitol which if you have a sensitive stomach it can give you belly aches from just ingesting a little bit.  I found this out the hard way, not a big deal because I was able to return the product without a hassle, great customer service on amazon.  I have learned that pure stevia powder, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QRU5ZQ">30 Grams (1.06 Oz) Stevia 95% Steviosides Bulk Powder</a> contains no xylitol and certain liquids do to but if they do not explicitily say it in the product description, you can be sure that it will contain xylitol since its cheaper to sell it that way.  I'm just glad that I have an alternative to sugar substitues like equal and splenda because for some reason my taste buds could never get use to those artifical sweeteners.

The intial taste was ok but had a strong aftertaste that stayed in your mouth for awhile. I later tried recipes specifically calling for liquid stevia. These recipes tasted quite good and typically used less liquid stevia.

Stevia comes in lots of flavors, even rootbeer, which I've used in sparkling water in place of diet soda - it's delicious and no headaches!  What could be better ...highly recommend!

review/text: I did a lot of research looking for the best reviewed stevia and chose this of the 2 (I like the liquid extract, I make a lot of cold drinks and didn't want to deal with dissolving anything). I have used stevia for 3 years now and have always had good, but not great stevia. Higher quality stevia, more pure that is, doesnt give that aftertaste of bitter liquorish. I didn't taste that at all in this stevia, and I definitely looked for it. Could be the flavoring they add to this, but either way the aftertaste isnt there. In my "research" I found out that SweetLeaf and NuNaturals have some of the highest concentrations of stevioside in them, meaning more sweet and less sour (the point of a sweetener...). If you like this flavour go with it, if not choose another. Either way you will be happy. Just a note, the flavor is there, but is slight, don't expect much with it in something like coffee, though one of the reviews on here talks about using it in seltzer water. That might let the flavor come through better since coffee, especially mine, is so strong....

review/text: So aspartame gives me migraines; I'm alergic to corn so corn sweetners are out; splenda tastes flat; and sugar is about the only reasonable choices except that it's -- well -- sugar -- and has calories galore in exchange for not much nutrition.  Stevia, however, (expecially the way Sweet Leaf does it) gives a cup of coffee just the right hint of sweetness without tasting like artificial and pretend pink, yellow, or blue packets.<br /><br />The flavored stevia drops are so far (I've tried the vanilla and the choc. raspberry -- but there are 4 more) the best addition to the menu I've had in years -- and are portable enough to carry with me anywhere.  I've been carrying the "Stevia Plus" packets for over 2 years now -- you can't beat a little green packet that gives you a teaspoon's worth of sweet plus a whole gram of fiber.  By the time I've been sitting in a cafe for an hour with a bottomless cup of decaf, I've had my day's fiber and great coffee to boot!<br /><br />Bravo!

review/summary: Sweet Leaf vs. Better Stevia
review/text: I bought this product for the first time 7 months ago.  I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017WG180">NOW Foods Stevia Liquid Extract Alcohol, 8 Ounce Bottle</a> three months later.  My motive was to compare these products and see which one is best for me.<br /><br />I will try to be as detailed as possible.  So again I am evaluating "Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme" and "Now Foods: Better Stevia Original".<br /><br />At first, I expected Better Stevia to be what the packaging described, a better alternative to Stevia drinkers.  I expected it to be exactly what they advertised in its packaging:<br /><br />-Better tasting<br />-Just as healthy<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />To compare them, I alternated an average of 6 drops into my morning coffee everyday.<br /><br />==Taste Evaluation==<br /><br />After everyday usage of these two products and after testing them extensively; I see no -significant- difference between the two in taste.  Please do take into consideration that I did not test these by serving suggestion amount (see Suggested Serving below).<br /><br />==Ingredients==<br /><br />Now let's talk about the ingredients.  Both products claim to be made with natural ingredients.  "Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme"  lists "natural flavors" apart from "Stevia extract".  "Now Foods Better Stevia Original" lists "water", "certified Organic Stevia extract" and "11% alcohol".<br /><br />Sweet Leaf has quite an advantage, since it does not list alcohol as an ingredient.<br /><br />I wanted more evidence about ingredients.  I thought that Sweet Leaf was trying to pull as fast one, by passing alcohol as a "natural flavor"; like many companies have done.<br /><br />So I visited the Sweet Leaf website and found this: "SweetLeaf Stevia� Sweetener does not use chemicals, alcohols, solvents or enzymes at any stage of the extraction and purification process."<br /><br />Bingo.  Sweet Leaf has -no alcohol-.<br /><br />==Suggested Serving and Packaging==<br /><br />"Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme" serving suggestion is 5 to 8 drops and contains a dropper for easier administration of the product.  You can count exactly how many drops you're serving.  As long as you don't go beyond 7-8 drops it should not be bitter at all.<br /><br />"Now Foods Better Stevia Original" serving suggestion is 1 to 4 drops and has a split-open cap that it's very messy.  You can't count by drops, usually it spills to the body of the container.  It is very difficult to measure exactly how much you're administering.  I found that many times the bitterness was noticeable due to not knowing how much I was using.<br /><br />Final evaluation from 1 to 5.<br /><br />Taste:<br /><br />"Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme" = 5<br /><br />"Now Foods Better Stevia Original" = 5<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />"Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme" = 5<br /><br />"Now Foods Better Stevia Original" = 4<br /><br />Suggested Serving and Packaging:<br /><br />"Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme" = 5<br /><br />"Now Foods Better Stevia Original" = 2<br /><br />All in all Sweet Leaf wins, for several reasons.  The packaging makes it very easy to serve the product properly. When I used the Sweet Leaf dropper with the Better Stevia I found that 4 drops weren't bitter.  But adding 8 drops of Better Stevia started to make my drink bitter.  So Better Stevia claims it tastes better, as long as you follow their serving suggestion.  Sweet Leaf tastes better otherwise.<br /><br />And to folks who really care about their alcohol intake for whatever reason; Sweet Leaf claims to have none.

review/summary: Much less of the funky stevia aftertaste than all the others
review/text: I love the idea of stevia, yet I've always struggled with the funky after taste. However, this vanilla creme flavor is great! I can use this in a smoothie and not add any other sweetener at all and love the vanilla taste it adds. I don't notice the stevia after taste as I do with the other brands or flavors by this brand. In addition, I can use it as the primary sweetener in other recipes, such as a particular cake icing I make using coconut cream, and if I then add just a bit of maple syrup the stevia taste is gone. So what previously would've used 1/2 - 3/4 cup of maple syrup, now only uses a tablespoon or so!<br /><br />Absolutely try this flavor - it's great!

review/text: I use this everyday in my tea. I love the vanilla flavor. Its perfect for tea or coffee. I don't like plain stevia. This adds a good flavor to any drink. I also love that its all natural,and has no calories or sugar.

review/summary: YUKKK!
review/text: I had heard so much about this natural sweetener that I was anxious to try it since the artificial ones I didn't want to touch at all, especially with their awful aftertaste. I suppose if it comes down to a choice between this stuff and artificial sweeteners this stuff is better for your body. The taste absolutely turned me off! Using more doesn't make things sweeter, it only makes the taste worse. Since I only use sugar in my coffee which I drink without anything else added, I find no sugar, just black is better than this!

review/summary: Stevia DOES have side effects!
review/text: I've always heard that Stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no ill side effects, so I was very interested to try it... especially when I started making my own yogurt, and would do anything to get my toddler to eat it! I did some research and found that the SweetLeaf brand was supposed to be the best, as far as extraction methods and experience. I got a bottle of the Vanilla Creme, and also the plain, and added it to our yogurt. It was fantastic! We all loved it, and the toddler begged for more. I was so relieved to have found a great way to reduce the sugar in our diets and still have such a great sweet taste. It was perfect, I was happy. But then, strange symptoms started to surface. At first I got headaches, which became increasingly severe, and then backaches that felt like spinal 'brain freeze' (when you eat something too cold too fast.) It didn't occur to me at first that it could be at all related to the new Stevia. Then my toddler started telling me he was itchy all over. Then I got my menstrual cycle 2 weeks early. Finally it dawned on me that it could be related to the Stevia since this was the only thing at all that had changed in our diets. I googled 'adverse reactions to Stevia' and found several webpages where people described symptoms identical to mine. I was truly shocked. I stopped the Stevia... all the symptoms went away almost immediately. I realize now that there is a difference between the flavored liquid Stevia, which contains a 'proprietary blend' and 'natural flavors' (which could mean anything) and just the straight powder with nothing added (I haven't tried that, but won't now.) It also occurs to me that maybe the only Stevia that can truly be considered historically safe is the actual leaf itself, straight off the plant out of the garden. I still believe Stevia's safety record in the countries where it originated, but I think something has probably been lost in translation with the processing of it here in the US. Just my opinion. It should also be noted that anyone with allergies to ragweed should not take Stevia because it can cause asthma attacks. Hope this helps someone.

review/summary: Best Stevia
review/text: I have used many Stevias, but none compare to Sweet Leaf. It is the best out there and I love the Vanilla in particle but all the flavors are great, just enough flavoring without over powering it. Peggy
