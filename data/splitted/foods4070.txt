review/summary: Good beans
review/text: If you like the sweetness of southern-style baked beans you can't go wrong with Bush's. Bush takes the old style pork and beans dish and ups the ante by bringing in choice spices and a dash of brown sugar to make a bean that ANYONE would be happy to drag a hotdog through. My choice is to heat up a can of these beans while grilling burgers and dogs and mix in a dollop of yellow mustard into the beans or sometimes, when I'm feeling especially wild and crazy, add some chopped onion to the mix as well. Man you'd better chain me down on those afternoons, cause I'm living life on the edge on those days, let the law be damned on those crazy afternoons cause I'm out of control!

review/summary: Absolutely disgusting...in every way.
review/text: I love Bush's regular and Grillin' beans, but this stuff is absolutely horrid. Imagine taking the most absolutely cheap roadside diner artificial maple syrup and mixing in overcooked beans and sugar. This stuff was absolutely disgusting. I actually had to walk to the trash can and spit it out. It was not a pleasant site. How people can eat this kind of crap bewilders me. Its so sickening and cloyingly sweet as to be gross beyond belief. And we wonder why there is an obesity epidemic in this country?

review/summary: Nicely flavored baked beans
review/text: Bush's Baked Beans is a standard adjunct to my grilling efforts for meals. The basic baked beans go nicely with grilled food. Even tastier, though, is this variation on the baked bean theme--maple cured bacon baked beans.  The maple and bacon flavors add a delicious edge to the flavor.<br /><br />Better yet, the beans are high in fiber and low in fat (even with bacon flavoring). The one downside--a high level of sodium.<br /><br />Still and all, I will continue to use this as a nice side dish when I grill foods.

review/summary: Dirty generic candy
review/text: Candy came "dirty" - red, orange, green, blue dots all over them - And not in TROLLI brand packaging. They come in a sealed (thank goodness) plastic glassine bag with a "sweet gourmet" sticker on the outside. I believe that they are generic brand candies, and not the name brand Trolli's that I was expecting based on the name of the product. I am not impressed.<br /><br />I was buying these to display in a candy bar for a party, and they look terrible as display candy because of all the speckles. It looks like they were in a giant container with tons of other candies, and candy crumbs that then stuck to the outside of each little candy. Definitely not good enough for a glass display jar. Probably fine to eat, but If i were buying them for a gift, I would be mad that they didn't come in Trolli brand packaging. I'm also concerned with how they were handled before they were sealed into the current bag since they were obviously not factory sealed by Trolli.

review/summary: Cheap, Well Worth It.
review/text: Now, I've always been a fan of gummies. I love gummy candies, and I can never have enough of them. During one of my usual browsings through Amazon.com, I noticed they had these Strawberry puffs! It's something I have a lot of trouble finding nowadays. I couldn't resist ordering two pounds. Trust me, it's a bargain. Here, in NYC, my sister had bought 4 lbs of the stuff for about $30USD. Tell me that's not a little too pricey.<br /><br />The Strawberry puffs tasted exactly as I remembered them. They're sweet but not too sweet. I used to buy them from a little corner convenience store after school when I was little. But as I grew older, this type of candy grew rather hard to find. The stores that do sell them, they're overpriced!<br /><br />Anyway, if any of you love gummies, then I highly recommend these little candies. Just stay away from the apple flavored ones. They taste rather nasty.

review/text: My daughter loves these candies.  They used to sell them in Wal-mart, but they no longer carry them so for Christmas I went online to see if I could buy them outright from a candy distributor.<br /><br />When they arrived the bag wasn't sealed and one of the candies fell out when I lifted up the bag.  When I poured them into a tin to wrap for Christmas I noticed some of the candies had blue dots on them and some of them looked "dirty"!?!<br /><br />I tried contacting the seller but have not received a reply back.  VERY Disappointed.  I've never had a problem with Amazon before.  What a bummer

review/summary: Great product for low sodium diet!
review/text: As someone with a heart condition forced to be on a low-salt/no-salt diet, Cavender's SALT FREE All Purpose Greek Seasoning is simply the best seasoning I have found to replace the flavor in the "low sodium" and salt-free foods currently available. I have tried various other "name brand" and "no name" seasonings in search of some miracle to help the flavor of the low-salt/no salt foods with no great success. Until Cavender's, that is. You do need to be careful to pick up the SALT FREE version, as they also have a salted version in very similar packaging. I use it in stews, soups, on meats and salads, and on virtually all low-salt/no salt foods to enhance the taste of what is otherwise bland, tasteless or just plain nasty fare without the help of the Cavender's. We keep one container in the spice rack near the range top for cooking  and another within easy reach on the dining table.

review/text: I purchased this tea to find out what tea from China really tasted like after seeing a documentary film that stated westerner's are drinking tea that migrated of a sort over a mountain and down into a border country.It had changed/adapted and was no longer similar,thus it should taste somewhat different expecially since it has been transplanted everywhere it will grow by now.This tea was somewhat better than Luzianne's black ice tea bags in flavor and became stronger since I  leave my tea bags in my 10 oz. cup.I sometimes use 2 tea bags of luzianne or earl gray and could not do that more than the one time with this tea.that means I got more tea strength per bag witch makes me happy.Seemed like it had more caffiene as well.

review/summary: Great for gluten free cooking
review/text: Since being diagnosed with Celiac Disease nearly two years ago I have had to learn to eat and cook differently. I have missed some old stand by recipes I've used and enjoyed for many years. Like making stroganoff from leftover meat using canned cream of mushroom soup as a main ingredient. I just found this product was available. Weird to be so excited about soup! This soup is has a thinner consistency than those most of us have grown up using like Campbell's, etc. I need to account for that and the soup is a little more bland. So taste as you go and add salt, pepper, and whatever you might like.<br /><br />For those of us with Celiac this is a huge convenience.

review/text: IF YOU HAVE CELIAC DISEASE OR SOY ALLERGIES, THIS IS NOT THE PERFECT SOUP YOU WERE HOPING TO FIND.  The list of ingredients on Amazon is not correct!!<br />  My children have Celiac disease and soy allergies.  I thought I had found the perfect soup.  I was sadly mistaken.<br />  The listed ingredients here on Amazon (AND on the manufacturer's website) is different from the cans that arrived in the mail from Amazon.  The picture looks the same, but the ingredients are NOT.<br />  This soup is NOT SOY FREE (contains soy sauce) OR GLUTEN FREE (Yeast Extract and Natural Flavors).  Here's what the can label ACTUALLY lists:<br />"Filtered Water, Organic Mushrooms, Organic Cream (from milk), Organic Rice Flour, Organic Mushroom Concentrate (Organic Mushrooms, Organic SOY SAUCE [Organic Soybeans, Organic Maltodextrin], Organic Mushroom Powder, Organic Butter [Organic Cream, Lactic Acid], Organic Molasses, YEAST EXTRACT, Organic Potato Flour, Organic Flavor, Natural Flavor), Organic Rice Starch, Salt, Natural Flavors, Organic Canola Oil, Organic Onion Powder, Organic Parsley, Organic White Pepper, Organic Thyme.  CONTAINS MILK AND SOY"<br /><br />Notice it doesn't warn about the possible wheat/gluten from the Yeast Extract or Natural Flavors.  I called the manufacturer to find out if their Organic Soy Sauce contains wheat.  They claim it does not.  THEY COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE "NATURAL FLAVORS" WOULDN'T CONTAIN GLUTEN.  I wouldn't risk it if you have Celiac disease.  I forgot to ask them about the Yeast Extract sources.

Consumer health and safety is our number one concern. We do not have lists of products that are specifically considered to be gluten free. Reading the label is the best way to check for the presence of ingredients which contain gluten. If gluten is a major ingredient, it will be specified in the ingredient list. For consumers concerned about the presence of trace amounts of gluten, we suggest avoiding products that include natural flavors or spices."<br /><br />In addition, the soup is incredibly fat-laden. A lot of  "Natural cream" will clog up one's arteries as well as non-specific cream.  It's unnecessary to load the product up with so much animal fat in my opinion.

The rich flavor and settle hint of pepper is just perfect. I cut the recipe in half and enjoy the portion of it every sunday with my biscuits. Thanks to this gravy sunday is the breakfast I look forward to most.

review/text: My dog loves these chips.  Only thing they are high since he insists on having them a couple times a day.  Wonder what the secret ingredient is. HOWEVER, he would not eat this batch.  I called Dingo Co. to see if they had changed the formula, and they said no, and checked the bar code to find that these chips had been manufactured over two and a half years ago. THEY WERE STALE.  They are high enough to begin with but to have to pitch them out or pay to return them (paid for initial shipping) is wrong.  BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE.

review/summary: Best. Sauce. Ever.  BUT--beware of the price!
review/text: Simply put, this is the only jarred pasta sauce that (to me) tastes as good as what can be made from scratch.  It's awesome on any kind of pasta or pizza crust.  I can literally eat it right from the jar.<br /><br />However, the current price here (148 for a case) is way to high.  A single jar in the grocery store normally runs about $11 where I live.  This price is over $12/jar.  Also you can purchase a case of 32 oz jars of marinara directly from Rao's (just Google it) for $108.<br /><br />Bon appetit!

review/text: this was a 5 star sauce, now it's a one star. they have started cutting corners in the last few months (as of 10/15/12) and this sauce is no longer quality or worth the 9 dollar asking price. im very disapointed as i previously said this is the best jar sauce, but it isn't anymore.. they started being cheap and the quality suffered, now they can keep their new garbage sauce, its no better tasting than the average two dollar tomato pastey aauces on the shelves. go with newman's own, that was the next best thing i've tried.

review/summary: THIS IS THE BEST MARINARA I'VE EVER TASTED!
review/text: This marinara sauce is not just dinner - it is an experience!<br />I've tried so many sauces over the years and had almost given up finding a store-bought variety that would be worthwhile. Then I found this one at our local Kroger store. This sauce is so indescribably good that it actually, literally brought goose bumps up and down both of my arms. The other brands of sauce are monstrosities of monumental proportions compared to Rao's. I would never have thought that any mere mortal could combine a few simple ingredients in the perfect proportions and come up with something like this marinara that defies description. My God, it was like it made love to my whole mouth! It permeates the tongue and palate, even teeth and gums and the insides of my whole mouth - making this sauce "the flavor to savor," even an hour after dinner. I've never tasted any other pasta sauce that even approaches this sublime sauce. It is so rich and flavorful. Try this sauce and you will understand why I'm gushing and drooling all over for this heavenly marinara. I gladly paid the $10 this evening for another jar, this time for the arribbiata which is also delicious. I never would have thought any pasta sauce could taste this good, fantastic actually. It is even better than my mother's and my uncle's. You will think that you died and entered the Pearly Gates, dripping with Rao's Marinara!

review/summary: What Happened to the Rao's recipe
review/text: I have always been a fan or Rao's Marinara sauce and willing to shell out the premium price of $7-$9 a bottle. However of late (I would say within the last 3-6 months) the recipe or process has apparently changed. The sauce is no where near as fresh tasting as it once was. The sauce is now more homogenized and bland to the point that I will no longer shell out the premium price for a product that is no better then sauces selling for $2 a bottle. It is sad that the company has cut corners in the way that they have (perhaps they have expanded production and are using a new supplier). I hope that they return to their original recipe or drop the new manufacturing source.<br /><br />Considering the price point and the average quality I would rate the current product as poor.<br /><br />I would be interested in other opinions.<br /><br />Sign me an unhappy customer.

review/summary: Artificial sweetener plus sugar make a bad-tasting cocoa
review/text: This hot chocolate is nice and convenient and you can brew it strong or less strong because the VUE lets you customize temperature and volume. But sad to say, I found it too sweet. The reason for it's being sweet is that in addition to sugar, it is sweetened with sucralose (aka Splenda.) This is a new trend in foods-- a mix of natural and artificial sweeteners. (Have you seen chewing gum? Even the non-sugar-free varieties have aspartame?) The reason for using a mix of natural and artificial is interesting but I believe in this case, using sucralose lowers the calorie count of the cocoa and it also allows more sweetener in a smaller cup size, as sucralose takes up less space than granulated sugar. I had to tease out the ingredient info by carefully reading the box, as it doesn't say so on the cup.<br /><br />Here's the good news, if you don't want sucralose, or even if you don't want sugar AND sucralose, you can buy packet cocoas and make a cup of hot water with the VUE, any volume and temp you choose. Just mix it up yourself. The only powdered mix I ever liked was Caotina (from Switzerland) which was not so sweet as American varieties but I can't find it in the US. However, I have guests who adore hot chocolate when they visit my office or home, so I keep Swiss Miss on hand.<br /><br />In any case, for the Cafe Escapes, blech!

review/summary: The taste is excellent! Can be found cheaper everywhere.
review/text: I completely agree with another reviewer, why this is twice the price on Amazon is crazy??!  You can find this from Walmart for just over $3. You can even get it from them online from their website. What is going on with the price here, I don't know.<br /><br />As to the cappuccino  itself, I love it. Because I want it to go further, I add a heaping teaspoon to my coffee, then I add Coffeemate French Vanilla Creamer. I know...that's a lot of flavor. So? It gets me going!!! :D<br /><br />I have made it straight, but you need a lot of it to achieve a rich, full bodied cup of coffee. Then when you do, it is soooo rich, it's more like dessert. If you want that, then totally go for it!! But I like a more coffee flavor, so I mix them.<br /><br />I do love General Foods International Coffees, but you get soooo much less in each can for the same price. If you love flavored coffee, try this from Hills Bros. (Note, currently at Wmart they have two sizes, 16 oz and 12 oz for exactly the same price. Be sure to get the big one!)  It comes in a plastic container similar to the Folger's red container. Nice, because you could reuse it and store rubber bands or post it notes in this.<br /><br />As to a gift? I think adding it to a basket would be wonderful, although the GF International coffees do look a bit nicer in their tins IMO. Flavor-wise, you can't beat this. It comes out creamy and rich but not toooo sweet, like a good cappuccino should be.

review/text: I have a 6 year old chocolate labrador retriever.  Chip has been plagued with a dry itchy coat and profuse shedding for the past 5 yrs.  My vet thought that he was allergic to grains and suggested I try the Nature's Variety GRAIN FREE dog food.  After two months, chip's skin stopped flaking, his shedding reduced exponentailly and his coat was as shiny as when he was a pup. I was a skeptic in the beginning thinking that chip was on the pro plan diet and that was good, right? WRONG!  I highly recommend this food.  Do the research and find what low grade ingredients are in name brand pet foods on the market today.  When all of the dog food poisionings and recalls happened you never seen this brand on the list.  I truly am a believer in this product.

review/summary: No More Allergies or G.E.R.D.~
review/text: When I met my last rescue pet, Dixie, approximately 6.5 years ago, she was a real mess--both externally and internally.  She exhibited a nervous condition {G.E.R.D.} that my vet said was due to her previous horrendous living conditions; that is to say, that everything that went down her goozle promptly came right back up!  She was painfully emaciated, skeletal almost, and her blood-work was all over the place.  So, after a round of IV fluids and 2 bags of 'Science Diet' chow, Dixie came home with me to recuperate and to learn how to live in a loving home.  The first thing I did was to research which pet foods would address her particular condition; I knew that I didn't want to keep her on the 'Science Diet' regimen--it's too full of ingredients that I feel don't belong in a proper diet for dogs.  Lo' and behold, I stumbled upon the "Nature's Variety Instinct" formula for dogs.  It seemed like a good fit, due to all of the proper ratios {protein/fat} and totally 'GRAIN-FREE".  Viola!  The rest, as they say, is history.... 6.5 years later, Dixie now weighs in at approximately 20 loving, happy pounds of my friendly and well-adjusted best friend.

review/summary: High quality item - but not for every dog
review/text: Please note that I am not questioning the inherent quality of this dog food. Nature's Variety is known to make one of the best commercial grain-free diets out there. Their ingredients are top-notch, and my dogs certainly enjoyed this food. The problem is that it seemed to make their stomach issues worse instead of better. It seems that some dogs simply have problems digesting a totally grain-free diet, because of how rich the food is. My dog ended up having to have simply chicken and rice, which has so far kept his tummy issues under control (fingers crossed). Consult your vet before switching your dogs to a grain-free diet, in case grain isn't the issue causing their problems.

Above-average fat. And below carbs when compared to a typical dry dog food.<br /><br />Free of any plant-based protein boosters, this looks like the profile of a kibble containing an abundance of meat.<br /><br />When you also consider its lack of any critical Red Flag items, it becomes obvious we're evaluating an exceptional dry food.<br /><br />Bottom line?<br /><br />Nature's Variety Instinct is a grain-free kibble using an abundance of meat and poultry meals as its main sources of animal protein... thus earning the brand five stars.<br /><br />Enthusiastically recommended."<br /><br />***petfoodratings.net gives the product 5 Stars as well, saying:<br /><br />What's good about this food....<br />Grain-free, very high in quality meat content (first 3 ingredients), pumpkinseeds are great for fiber & skin/coat, herring meal, fruits/veggies.<br /><br />....and what's not so good.<br />Nothing.<br /><br />***dogfoodanalysis.com also lists this as one of their 6 star (best) brands.  The packaging is different, as it was from 2009, but same ingredient list:<br />"The first and fifth ingredients in this food are named meat products, in meal form. Although it is easier to have confidence that there is a good amount of meat in a food when there are multiple meat meal ingredients heading the ingredient list, the supporting macronutrient breakdown of this product lends a high level of confidence in the amount of meat product in the food. The inclusion of fish meal amongst the major incredients provides a good source of omega 3 and 6 OFAs.<br /><br />Tapioca is the starch content with primary purpose as thickener. It is the second ingredient in a food with likely carbohydrate content of around 26% DMB.<br /><br />There are no grains in this food. The major carbohydrate source is tapioca, which may be particularly useful for dogs with sensitivities to potatoes or who suffer arthritis. There is a good range of fruits/vegetables in the food, and a good range of probiotics.<br /><br />We note that chicken fat is the third ingredient in the food and that research at Purdue University has identified fat in the top four ingredients of dry dogs foods as a factor increasing the risk of bloat in large breed dogs. The presence of citric acid as a preservative means that this food should not be pre-moistened prior to feeding (pre-moistening of foods preserved with citirc acid has also been identified as a factor increasing the risk of bloat).<br /><br />This food is outstanding in that it contains no grains whatsoever. Grains are not a natural part of a canine diet and it is pleasing to see dog foods on the market that exclude grains completely from the diet.<br /><br />The only caution we would make on this food is that the high protein and calcium content may make it suitable for adult dogs only, particularly in the case of large breeds."<br /><br />***On the best brands list at[...]

Similarly, the company doesn't seem to pander to what the average pet owner assumes that dogs need to live well, which, of course, is often wrong. All and all, this is the best made pet food for the best price I have found. Certainly, it is more expensive than the pet market leaders or the big retailers' house brands, but it's a wonderful balance between price and quality. Your pet deserves the extra to live a long healthy life.

My vet is a hostically-oriented accredited and licensed professional who has studied food-therapy for companion animals extensively.  It may seem that this product is more expensive than others, but due to it's high nutrient density she requires less...less than even the package recommends.

review/summary: Seems great, didn't work for us
review/text: I have a 100 lb lab/weim mix who is a little over 2 years old. He has allergies that have progressively gotten worse as he has aged. I haven't had him tested yet but it is clear he cannot eat anything with oats, corn, and even potatoes seem to trigger allergies. His allergies are most commonly seen as stinky, black yeasty ears but he also will get patches on his skin that he chews on continuously, mostly around his feet/legs and dry skin - since he is black it is very obvious when his skin flakes - and hair. Vets haven't helped much besides giving me products to clean his ears - which didn't work! I've tried Dr E's Grain and Potato Free Limited Ingredient Buffalo (cleared his ears up but he hated it and I kept having to put other food in it. Arcana Pacifica - smells just like fish but his ears get worse and his skin flakes more (I think the potato?), Grandma Lucy's Grain Free Chicken - he loves this but his ears get worse; Wells Earthborn Holistic Primitive Natural Grain Free - got bad ears and horrible HORRIBLE dry skin flakes, he looked practically gray.  Prior to this his allergies really flaring up he mostly ate Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Chicken.<br /><br />Anywhoo - with this his ears are still runny but not as bad as usual (his right ear gets really bad but his left ear has hardly any stuff in it when I clean them almost daily) and his dry skin flakes have almost gone BUT he's been licking sores into his legs so clearly there is still something in this he is reacting to. I've started adding in Dr E's potato and grain free duck formula and his ears have gotten better but since his legs look worse so we won't continue on this. The only thing I can think is the alfalfa meal? because the Dr E's has tapioca and he never had a problem with that though I do know some dogs are allergic to that. Or perhaps the chicken? so frustrating and sad for my dog with trying to figure this out. He eats less of this then he had other foods and he isn't getting underweight (as he seemed to when he ate the Buffalo he hated) but his breath really smells on this. badly! so we won't be re-purchasing and the search continues.<br /><br />otherwise it came in a timely manner and was as described. if it had worked I would have continued with the subscribe and save, it is a nice savings. the local independent pet store here carries it but for a much higher price point.

review/summary: VERY PLEASED I TRIED IT
review/text: My dog has allergies that create skin problems.  Tried a lot of foods and other methods to help it.<br />New vet recommended no grain dog food and gave me a few names of manufacturers that are trustworthy (ie ingredients listed are true).  Chose the least expensive one (which was comprable to the other "premium" dogfoods I was feeding him)<br />around $50-$60 for 25 lb.  He likes it (he's picky).  His coat is shinier now.  His skin allergies are minor irritations when they used to be awful and turn into staph infections.  I am really happy I found this vet and tried this food.

review/summary: Buy small bags before getting this food
review/text: Dog got very sick from this food even though he was already on a grain-free diet.  Not sure if it was an allergy(ingredients were almost identical to his old food) or some kind of bacteria but make sure before you buy this food for the first time, you get a small bag to feed your dog for a week to make sure they can handle it as it seems to be pretty rich.

review/summary: Doggies say yum!
review/text: I have 3 dogs. After giving them cheap Walmart dry food and stepping in doggie diarrhea throughout the house, a high quality dry food was necessary. I like Natures Variety Instinct because it's grain- free, good fat content, high animal protein and the kibble size is good. Expense is offset by quality over quantity of useless fillers used in cheaper food and who knows what other toxins. Plus the Subscribe and Save helps in cost, time  and back breaking lugging of packages. Digestion is good. Poop looks good. Fur is fine.<br />And I can walk without fear through the house.

review/summary: Tomato Soup the way you remember it
review/text: For some reason, the good people at Heinz see fit to market a number of delectable items that Americans might like but are reserved for the Brits. One of them is baked beans (the kind you serve on toast, not the kind you serve with barbecue.) Another is this tomato soup.<br /><br />The soup comes in a pull-tab can, with two moderate servings (not quite a full soup mug.) You do not dilute this soup. The flavor is rich with tomatoes. The "cream" is some skim milk and a little bit of cream; this is not a bisque. The other chief attraction is that the soup has no wheat flour.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Tomatoes (84%), water, vegetable oil, sugar, modified cornflour, salt, dried skimmed milk, whey protein, cream, citric acid, spice extracts, herb extract<br /><br />Compare this with Campbells:<br /><br />tomato puree (water, tomato paste), water, wheat, flour, high fructose corn syrup, contains less than 2% of the following : salt, ascorbic acid (added to help retain color), flavoring, citric acid.<br /><br />Look, Campbells has that nasty HFCS! That cloying, sweet taste that is not good for you!  No wonder Heinz tastes like a tomato.

I just found it not in your ordinary "Campbell soup" isle, but in the foreign foods isle, tacos, taco shells,asian food, Japanese Udon noodles, Heinz Cream of Tomato Soup, etc.  It sells for $3.49 a can at Shaw's Supermarket in Manchester, NH.  So, next time you're at Shaw's or maybe your favorite food market, don't check the "Campbell's soup isle, check the foreign foods isle.

Fool me twice, shame on me..but again there won't be a second purchase.  Amazon should be showing expiration dates for perishables of any kind...Good luck in maintaining customers in your Grocery/Food stuffs.<br />  And please, review drones, spare me the whine that this is not a product review.  This is a review of the process whereby Amazon takes your money and provides a product worthy of your investment.  When the system doesn't work to the buyer's satisfaction, I want to know about it so as to avoid a costly transaction.  Blow it out your pie hole if you don't like it.

review/summary: Good taste, questionable ingredient...
review/text: This is the third stevia sweetener I have tried so I will compare it to those.  I have used NOW Stevia, and Truvia.<br /><br />This tastes the same as Truvia, which you can buy in the grocery store.  It is less bitter than NOW Stevia.<br /><br />What bugs me is this - it is labeled as "stevia" but the first ingredient is agave inulin, which is a fiber product.  Second ingredient listed is stevia extract.  And the last ingredient is silica.  I looked up silica - it is that grainy stuff in little packets they package with electronics - the packets labeled DO NOT EAT.  I read that silica is not actually toxic but that doesn't mean I want to eat it.  Stevia by itself is prone to caking, so I guess the silica is to prevent that from happening.<br /><br />If you are ok with eating silica, this is a tasty sugar substitute.  If you are trying to be healthy and keep weird things out of your diet, I'd suggest you pass.

review/text: I have been using stevia for the last several years. It's got zero calories and does not act like sugar in your system. At the same time, it is natural and harmless. The only things you have to look out for are: 1) some brands have a bitter aftertaste, and 2) supermarket brands often have sugar alcohols added (sorbitol, e.g.) which is not good for you. This brand has neither, just a pleasant sweet taste, equivalent to 2 tsp of sugar per packet. I make my iced tea with it and it's delicious. Recommended for anyone watching their sugar intake.

Splenda, Pure Via(Stevia), and Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia.  Splenda tastes like sugar: is a chemically altered malt and cane product,(been using it in cooking).  Pure Via has a very intense strange supersweet/bitter taste, leaving an aftertaste,(stuck with a big box): is a Stevia extract, cellulose, etc.  Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia tastes like sugar with honey undertones, smooth and mild: is an organic Agave inulin (inulin is good stuff produced from many different plants), organic Stevia extract, silica.  Of the three products, "THE WHOLESOME SWEETENERS ORGANIC STEVIA TASTES THE BEST", says my tastebuds!  The product may cost a bit more, but the benefits seem to be worth it.

review/summary: Great sugar replacement, and organic too!
review/text: First off, the great point of stevia as a sweetener:  it is a natural product.  Love that.  And throw in the fact that it has no calories, zero glycemic index, no artifical ingredients.  This Wholesome Sweeteners product has an advantage in that it is organic, while not all stevia products are.  I'm very sensitive to pesticides in our food products, so I really appreciate organics.  This stevia is packaged much like the thin packages of artificial sweetener, and it is processed into a fine powder.  The individual packets are sealed well with an airtight paper.  The box says that each packet has the equivalent taste of 2 teaspoons of sugar.  That's probably about right, as I drink my coffee without creamer, so I like it just a tad sweet.  When opening the package, the stevia powder flows right out when poured, no clumping, and it dissolves quickly.  I've heard some people say that stevia is an acquired taste, but I've loved the taste of stevia in my coffee since the first time I tried it.  My only reservation about the Wholesome Sweeteners product, and this won't affect 99% of all consumers out there, but as a gluten-intolerant, I am very aware if any product has a disclaimer saying that this product is processed in shared facilities where wheat products are processed.  It does also list a handful of other common allergans that are processed at the same facility.  Now, chances are there isn't any cross-contamination of the allergans in the stevia product.  However, it's something that causes me to have to make a decision whether I want to take a chance on the potential for cross-contamination.  Anyway, that's my issue.  For everyone else, this is a great tasting product, it's organic, no calorie, I strongly recommend it for those reasons.  Would be 5 stars, if not for the cross-contamination potential.

review/summary: I like it.
review/text: I've used a few different brands of Stevia including Stevita Supreme and Sun Crystals (stevia mixed with sugar).<br /><br />I honestly don't find a huge difference between stevia of any brand.  It's a bit like asking which sugar tastes best.  On the other hand, I do find the Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia slightly better tasting than some other brands.  It's also a little more expensive than some other brands, but not overly so.<br /><br />One reviewer commented on the fact that this product contains "silica" and that silica is used when electronics are packaged.  What you find packaged with electronics is not the same as silica for food service use. Just like oil you put in your car is not the same kind of oil you use for cooking.<br /><br />Fine particle size silica, or its chemical cousin sodium silicoaluminate are used in a lot of food products. Especially, powdered food products. A primary use of the silica is to act as a flow agent, anti-packing agent, and water scavenger. Common table salt is a common example. Dissolve a teaspoon of table salt in a glass of water and you will observe that the solution is cloudy, not clear. This cloudiness is not undissolved salt, it is the silica-type mineral added to keep the salt flowing in humid conditions.

review/summary: Natural, distinct sweet taste
review/text: There is one key noticeable distinction between stevia and sugar: taste. I personally think you get ove it quickly, but I know people who never get used to it and prefer sugar.<br /><br />It's less noticeable than the taste of honey and much less so than molasses. But it's there, so don't expect something sweetened by stevia to taste the same as something that uses sugar.<br /><br />That said, stevia doesn't have the side effects of sugar. It's not as processed, naturally low calories, lower glycemic index, etc.<br /><br />This particular packet is ok, it has conveniently wrapped individual packages, and a recyclable light cardboard container. Though I prefer bulk and less useof packages, this keeps the stevia in good condition for longer time. To top it off, this stevia is organically grown.<br /><br />If the pricepoint was a little lower I would probably give it 5 stars.

review/summary: High in agave which I'm trying to drink less of, but the taste is good.
review/text: I like the taste of this sweetener and I am a huge fan of stevia, but my problem with it is that agave is the first ingredient. Now, contrary to popular myth, as someone in the food biz I can say that that does NOT mean it's mostly agave. As you can verify on the FDA website, ingredients are not listed in the order of what they contain most of as most people believe, but they are listed in order of weight...which means if there are 2 ounces of agave in a pack and one ounce of stevia, (I just made that weight up for explanation) then agave will be read first...even is there is a tablespoon of agave and 2 tablespoons of stevia in a packed (again, that amount is used just for explanation...doesn't contain near that much in a packet.). Since stevia weighs next to nothing, it still may very well be the main ingredient, but we do know there is a good deal of agave... and that's my issue.<br /><br />I actually switched to stevia from using agave as a sweetener (although I still use it occasionally.) because of the controversy and studies showing that it may very well have the same weight-gain effects as high fructose corn syrup due to how your body processes it. There are some very well respected doctors such as Dr Mercola who say this. I scoffed at first, until more reports said the same. I haven't made up my mind yet, but in the meantime I cut back on agave so when I bought stevia I didn't expect to find it there. But it's listed first in these packets.<br /><br />Why do they add another sweetener? Stevia is SO sweet that you have to. It takes a few grains to sweeten a drink...there would be nothing in the packet otherwise. However, I perfer to find it cut with erithritol as this does not spike your blood sure, is all natural, and zero calories.<br /><br />I now simply buy straight stevia in order to sweeten my coffee...in liquid form. It's not mixed with anything and is very economical. One drop sweetens an entire cup of coffee and the liquid form means it mixes perfectly.<br /><br />This isn't a bad sweetener...it could be a bit sweeter if I had my say...but my main gripe is I believe they'd have better marketing if they cut it with another natural zero calorie sweetener with less current controversy.  For agave lovers, however, it would be the best pick. For me, I'm lukewarm.<br /><br />Now, add to that it has silica...this is not in any other stevia products I've bought. Look, I just want stevia...or a stevia and eriythritol blend...but not a mix of stevia and stuff I don't want.<br /><br />Anyone consuming stevia is likely a label reader so I think this product would do well to tigthen its' belt in order to compete...and by that, I mean stick with cleaner ingredients.

review/summary: Tastes most like real sugar!
review/text: We've been dedicated Stevia users for almost 10 years and have tried pretty much every product on the market.<br />We thought we had found the best-tasting one out there--until we sampled Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia.<br /><br />It comes in a foil packet which contains the equivalent of two teaspoons of sugar, but, with stevia, a little goes a long way.  I find half a packet plenty sweet for a mug of tea.<br /><br />And, while first-time Stevia users might detect a slight bitter after-kick, I personally don't notice it.  It tastes closer to sugar than any Stevia product I've previously used.  Maybe because it's organic, or maybe because it's blended with organic blue agave inulin, which also aids in digestion, but I'm really liking it, especially in hot liquids, where it dissolves very quickly.<br /><br />I also like that fact that, unlike my previous fave, it doesn't produce a little cloud of "powder" when you tear open the packet.  I enjoy stevia in may beverages--up my nostrils, not so much.

review/summary: Great taste, low cal
review/text: Always on the lookout for a good non-sugar substitute (or high fructose corn syrup) not necessarily because of calories but sugar has never appealed to me. And, I can't stand HFCS.<br />Stevia tastes very sweet and can easily be the next big thing in sweeteners. As the price continues to drop, keep an eye on this product. This is still a bit pricey and stevia proves worthwhile as a beverage sweeter with limited use in foods.<br />When the price comes down a bit more I'll be switching to stevia for good.

review/summary: Travels easy - good taste
review/text: I've been a stevia fan for a few years now.  Usually I buy it in 1.3 oz or 3oz bottles.  Almost always organic, and almost always 100% stevia.<br /><br />What I Like About This Product: These packets of stevia travel easy, and the taste is good.<br /><br />What I Don't Like:  It's not 100% stevia. However, the only other ingredient is organic agave inulin. In fact, the inulin is the main ingredient.  I didn't know what inulin was, so I had to look it up.  It's "a polysaccharide based on fructose present in the roots of various plants."<br /><br />A little more research into inulin found that it has widespread use in the food industry. That's always raises a yellow flag for me, but digging deeper I found it didn't have any reported side effects.  With that, I felt comfortable with this inulin / stevia combination, especially since the inulin comes from organic agave.<br /><br />To elaborate on the taste factor, I've noticed that different brands of stevia have distinctly different tastes (due to many factors).  So while some stevia I love, others are "eh" and some qualify as all out "blech."  This brand has a good taste (to me, anyway - your mileage may vary).<br /><br />It's a fine product that I have no problem recommending. I want to give it four and half stars (only because stevia is not the main ingredient), but I'll round it up to five.

review/summary: Changed my mind about stevia .. a little....
review/text: I last used Stevia about a decade ago; I always found it to be too bitter and just not something I enjoyed. My husband liked it in his coffee and tea, but he seems to be oblivious to off flavors.<br /><br />I have to admit being very surprised when I tried one of these Wholesome stevia packets; I braced myself for that distinctive biting off-placed stevia taste, but it did not come. I would actually use these! I put some in my purse so that we can have them the next time we are at a restaurant that has iced tea. (Restaurants don't stock stevia or anything other than the usual sugar or artificial sweeteners, that I have found)<br /><br />I noted the word 'agave' on the front of the box and I have to admit a negative feeling towards agave; it is not the natural wonder sweetener some people think it is. Hey I used to believe it too!! But then I found how it's processed, and it is no different than corn syrup, it just has a pretty story attached to it. *SO* just by the fact that the word agave was on the front of the box, I would have assumed it was a stevia/agave sweetener and I would never have touched this product. My lip curls at the Agave marketing hype. However it has agave INULIN, a fiber, as a sweetener. This is no different than any other type of inulin you find in other products (like chicory inulin), it just happens to come from agave. So if you have a dislike of agave, don't let the source of the inulin put you off. In this case, inulin is inulin and the source of it does not matter glycemically as it would if we were talking 'agave syrup'.<br /><br />These packets have 1 carbohydrate each, the same as Splenda.<br /><br />My husband of course, liked these packets. He liked them better than the glycerite (liquid reduction of stevia) he's been using. I would buy these for him.

review/summary: No funky aftertaste! :)
review/text: Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia with Organic Blue Agave Inulin<br /><br />If the sweetener boasts of being zero calorie, zero artificial ingredients, can be used with hot or cold food or beverages, comes in an  individual (take anywhere) serving convenience -- into my shopping cart it goes! :)<br /><br />I currently use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6JPQQ">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener</a> for my bit of sweetness, and am satisfied with it -- but, have always wanted to try Stevia, as an alternative.<br /><br />Compared to Splenda, Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia with Organic Blue Agave Inulin is a wonderful, finely ground, white crystal sort of product, which looks and has the same texture as cane or beet sugar, or Splenda.<br /><br />Dissolves super fast in hot or cold liquid -- and on my daily oat bran or grapefruit half.  I like that! :)<br /><br />I found that Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia with Organic Blue Agave Inulin does not taste as super sweet as Splenda (using one-to-one, individual serving, packet for comparison).  But, that is okay, as taste is subjective to the user!  To Me, it has a mellow, smooth, honey, sort of sweetness.<br /><br />No funky aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm glad I finally tried Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia, and am off to order more!<br /><br />Does Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia sound like what you may be looking for, in a sweetener? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012

review/summary: sweet enough for me but is not all stevia
review/text: I feel it is sweet enough for me but I am trying to tame my sweet tooth and cutting back on sweets. I don't like that it has the agave in it, It is not something I am interested in using on a regular basis. There is some controversy it seems over how good agave really is for your body. I am looking for a natural sweetener that is good for you and tastes good. I am not completely convinced that this is what I want. Everyone has there own tastes and can make their own decisions. This is just my opinion.

review/text: I've tried a lot of stevia - not sure why this has agave or silica but then again, the last stevia I bought had lactose listed first, then stevia leaf.<br /><br />The taste is good and it dissovles fast, but I wish it was just pure stevia.

review/summary: Alternative to sugar, but not very competitive to other Stevias
review/text: As I continue to try to decrease sugar intake, I like to test out the different brands of Stevia sweeteners. The Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia comes in a box of 35 individually sealed packets. Each packet contains 1 gram. Most of that weight is in dietary fiber according to the box - 0.8 grams. The individual packets are large enough (6.5 by 4cm) that you can fold over if you only plan to consume a portion of each packet instead of the one packet.<br /><br />I compared this to my current favorite Stevia, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a> and here is what I found: Stevita is more white, while this one (Wholesome Sweeteners) is more off-white/creamy. Stevita is more crystalized while this one is more on the flour side of things. Stevita tastes better on a direct taste test, but when I mix them in a drink (tea, water, etc), there's no big difference. Stevita does not have dietary fiber. Both are 1 gram per packet, and the packets are about the same dimensions. Prices can change over time, but based on current prices, Stevita is a better value.<br /><br />The inside back of the container includes a $2 off coupon pre-printed on the actual container.

review/summary: Good but not the stevia I prefer
review/text: I like stevia but through my journey's thru different types I prefer the liquid best because you don't have to wait for it to dissolve and I would rather have a pure stevia product not any additives which this has. I don't know why they call it stevia anyway because it's a hybrid of two different sweeteners. This isn't bad but for me it's not the best.

review/summary: Convenient, no aftertaste
review/text: I think I'd only give five stars to sugar so four is probably as good as its going to get for a zero calorie experience. The little packets are nice to carry; they are a bit heavier than most artifical sweeteners which are in fragile packets. You can carry it in your purse without being afraid that it would end up on the bottom.

review/summary: An addition, but not an alternative to sugar or Splenda
review/text: Our family has gone out of our way for years to reduce sugar as much as possible in this modern lifestyle. For the past few years, that has mostly involved switching to products using Splenda (sucralose-based) as a sweetner, and a sugar/Splenda mix for tasks like baking.<br /><br />We've never used a Stevia based product until now, partly because we've been happy with Splenda, and partly because I'd heard so many complaints about bitterness. Wholesome Sweeteners seems to have resolved this problem with their Stevia packets. We've used it in tea and coffee and it's great, no after-taste or bitterness. We have not used it directly on anything like cereal yet, but our friend did and she likes it as well. Will definitely be purchasing some more.

review/summary: A half packet in a cup of tea provides a smooth sweetness
review/text: When I first received this product, I was concerned to see that organic agave inulin was the first ingredient. I was expecting the ingredients to contain only stevia. However, after researching it, I found that this is common among the stevia products I've used.<br /><br />I tried it first using one packet in a cup of tea and found it too strong. But half a packet is perfect.  It dissolves quickly and provides a smooth and enjoyable sweetness.  I usually use liquid stevia, so I'm used to the stevia taste (which is slightly different than sugar).  I was impressed to notice little difference betwen this powder and the liquid form.<br /><br />This is a good product that I would purchase again.

review/text: This product was a happy addition to my usual afternoon tea, and indeed has a nice flavour, without any after-taste or bitterness. I only withheld the fifth star because, since I have never experienced any bad effects from other, less expensive artificial sweeteners, Stevia is relatively more expensive.

review/summary: It's ok, but not my favorite artificial sweetener.
review/text: I liked the idea of an organic sweetener, so I was prepared to make Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia my preferred product, but after trying it for a month, I think I shall stay with my old favorite, Splenda.  Stevia is "OK", but I found it to be not as sweet, when used in some instances.  My breakfast Cheerios needed at least two packets, and still didn't seem to pack the sweet flavor.  Plus I found the individual packets rather difficult to open sometimes.  They are kind of a foil/plastic type packet, and occasionally they fight back when I try to open them.  Plus sometimes the product is lumpy inside, despite the packaging.  If you are truly wary of side effects of other sweeteners, than this should work for you.  But I'm not going to give up my old brand.
