review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: I probably would have liked these better had I not followed the directions on the package.  I've had quite a lot of brown rice pasta, and this one was fairly neutral, flavor-wise.  It generally took on the flavor of what I cooked with it.  The texture was bothersome.  Again, had I cooked them more in water and NOT followed the directions on the package, the texture may have been better.  As it was, after soaking them for the requisite minute, they came out like straw.  It only went downhill when I put them in the skillet.  They began to breakdown to mush immediately.  There are other brown rice pasta products, even very fine ones such as this one, (Annie Chun's Maifun comes to mind) that will hold up to cooking and handling.  From a gluten-free standpoint this pasta is a thoughtful gesture.  That's about all it has going for it.  I don't recommend it at all.

review/summary: Decent enough for pan-fried noodles
review/text: Peacock's Brown Rice Vermicelli is a fairly decent gluten-free substitute for pan-fried noodles.  They're a bit bland on their own, but with the proper sauce and other ingredients, makes a good central dish.  1 star off for being slightly less than tasty leaves these at 4 stars.<br /><br />Calling this true vermicelli is a bit of a misnomer; these are very, very thin noodles that are not really capable of being boiled.  Instead, they're best pan-fried, and do soak up the flavor of whatever you end up putting in with them.  I ended up using a variety of veggies, some olive oil, and a bit of cheese, and they worked out quite fine.<br /><br />On their own, they're definitely blander than your average pasta, but as a gluten-free substitute they're not awful by any means.  I'd still recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVGV6">Mrs. Leeper's Corn Pasta</a> for those looking for a more pasta-type dish, but these aren't the worst thing to have in your cupboard for the more specialized cook.  4 stars.

review/summary: Really good noodles
review/text: I have never liked any brown pasta, and have always avoided vermicelli (because of its tendency to soggily clump together) so I was doubtful about these noodles. They are from Singapore so I tested by finally making Singapore Rice Noodles, one of my favourite dishes. It mixes shrimp, squid and barbecued pork with veggies in an unusual curry AND chili sauce, and very much requires vermicelli.<br /><br />The recipe said to soak the noodles in warm water for 4-5 minutes; the packet said 1 minute. After one minute they were still stiff, so I let them sit for five, then dumped them into a colander and left them for twenty minutes. (Not usually a good idea, especially with vermicelli.)<br /><br />Came time to add them to the wok, they were still perfectly springy and al dente, delightful to eat. They also tasted really good, though the recipe I was using wasn't subtle in any way, so most of their flavour was buried.<br /><br />What particularly delights me is that vermicelli has now been added to my repertoire; I'll shortly be ordering more of these.

review/summary: Very nice addition to my pantry and table
review/text: I grew up enjoying Rice A Roni and it's vermicelli/rice mix. I've never heard of a Brown Rice Vermicelli so when this was offered, I jumped at the chance to give it a go. I just made a package of it and must say, I'm very pleased with both the taste and texture. Very simple to make a nice and healthy meal: I tried these plain to get a feel for their taste/texture, which was pleasantly nutty. Then, I put the Pesto/Sundried Tomato Sauce with Sauteed Shrimp I had made for it, mixed it together, and it turned out to be a stunning tasting and simple meal to pull together. I'll be adding this to my master grocery list app, for sure. It's nice to have something different than just rice or pasta for dinner. :)

review/summary: Brown Rice Vermicelli
review/text: These are really good vermicelli noodles, which are made out of brown rice.  They are very thin, and they taste really good.  This is gluten-free; therefore it is excellent for those people who are allergic to flour (wheat).  I am not allergic to flour, but I am just saying that it is good for those who are.  These can be used like regular pasta.<br /><br />I received mine today, and I was so excited about trying it.  I immediately cooked some of it; in fact, it was my dinner tonight.  I ate it with a can of tomatoes, just like I would have eaten regular pasta noodles.  It was really good and tasty.  And I loved the texture.<br /><br />There are so many different ways in which this brown rice vermicelli can be done.  I ate it with a can of tomatoes, but I am just thinking about all the things in which a person can do with it.  It can be eaten plain, or it can be made into Italian dishes, or into Asian dishes.  I am just thinking:  these noodles would be good in a skillet with broccoli florets and baby corns, slivered almonds or orange/lemon flavor.<br /><br />This is a product of Singapore.  I really enjoyed these noodles tonight, and I look forward to tomorrow.  I'll make it a different way tomorrow, probably something Asian.<br /><br />I highly recommend these noodles, whether or not you are allergic to flour.

review/summary: not for me
review/text: I was disappointed, to say the least, in this product. When I prepared it, I ended up with a sticky mass. The package directions don't give much in the way of directions for cooking--just two different recipes. I obviously overcooked the product. It was such a gummy mess that I had to throw it away. I would not try it again unless the package directions were much more specific about how to use it.

review/summary: Makes a perfect little boring & virtuous meal
review/text: What I'm about to describe is totally not what a normal person would do with this brown rice vermicelli (angel hair pasta) but whoever said I was normal!  It's certainly not anything like the nice pictures on the bag suggest, which is a stir-fry.  Now, THAT would be great and there are two nice recipes on the bag.  Here's what I did:  I soaked about half the bag in water and let it sit for a while.  Then I emptied a 32-ounce carton of Trader Joe low-sodium chicken broth into a large bowl, added the soaked vermicelli, and microwaved it until it was very hot.  Ate a nice little quick dinner.  I loved it.  The ingredients are (1) brown rice (2) sago starch (3) water.  Sodium is 2.4 mg per serving, sugar is 2.2g, fiber is practically zero at 0.6g.  Total carb which I don't care about but seems high but I don't know is 47.1g.  Made in Singapore.  Sure wish it were made in the USA.  Not an exciting meal but it was a quick and sometimes quick is key.  I gave it a 5 not because it was so fabulous in and of itself but because it was so simple to add to soup to have a filling meal with such little effort or thinking.  This would work with other soups, too, of course.  Next time I'll have it with Trader Joe low-sodium tomato soup and it'll be just as good a quick little meal if not better.

review/summary: With a few modifications to prep directions, these were pretty good.
review/text: This is fairly easy to fix.  Soak it in warm water for a minute, then stir fry with veggies and oil.  Doing it that way, I found it way too dry (a lot like straw), but after adding a cup of water, they softened up (although a bit too much).  If I try these again, I'll add a bit less water.<br /><br />While these noodles lacked much taste of their own, They nicely soaked up the flavor of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041CIP3M">Prima Taste Rendang Curry Sauce Kit</a>.  I fixed the Rendang according to package directions, then this bag of vermicelli, then I mixed it all together.  It made for a tasty dish.  While these weren't quite as firm as wheat pasta, it served its purposed quite nicely.<br /><br />I like that this pasta is healthy, and that it doesn't have gluten is a plus for those with gluten intolerance.

review/summary: Great Healthy Alternative
review/text: Vermicelli is a quick cook item that traditionally was only as offered in a white pasta. While the brown rice is not as tasty, for the most part you really can't tell the difference. I tried this product in two separate dishes. Once as an alternative to spaghetti. And the other as part of a Mediterranean rice dish<br />and both came out great! You are getting a lot of product in this package. The downside, sort of, is the instructions says you put the product in room temperature water. That did not work out for me. I had to boil water and cook for about 4-5 minutes to get it to the spaghetti like consistency I wanted to use it for. It's a great healthier alternative to white pasta.

review/summary: Good vermicelli, but cooking instructions are incorrect
review/text: My wife made a traditional dish using these brown rice vermicelli, and it turned out quite good. Noodle strands were separate (not mushy) and taste wasn't any different from regular rice vermicelli.<br /><br />My wife mentioned that if the vermicelli was cooked exactly as instructed on the package, noodles would come out too dry and hard. She said sha had to add some (about half a cup) more water during the preparation of the dish. That made the noodles soft enough, but still not mushy.<br /><br />I recommend this product considering the health benefit of brown rice and the taste.

It was a really good meal and if you need something to add substance to your meal that is healthy and gluten-free, this product is great for that. If you are not use to diet food or don't have to watch out for gluten-free products, I don't think you will like it. The noodles are dry, and taste rather bland.

This product fills the bill as long as you serve with a flavorful sauce and veggies plus meat of choice.

review/summary: Okay--but not great
review/text: I just purchased this product through Amazon. I have thus far only tried one dish--rice-a-roni. I found a recipe online and tried it out. Of course, my disappointment with the dish may be because of the recipe, so do keep that in mind.<br /><br />Main point? The rice-a-roni was very bland. Again, perhaps the recipe. But it did not inspire me to look at the brown rice vermicelli as a great ingredient. I have, however, a few additional recipes that I intend to use. Perhaps those will be more satisfying.<br /><br />So, this evaluation of the product is still "in process."

review/text: This is a great product if you re trying to avoid gluten. I like brown rice and that's probably why I like the taste of this vermicelli. The prep instruction could have been better, but otherwise the packaging was good. I found that soaking the noodles for about 15 minutes in warm water was best--giving them a softer texture. I may try parboiling them. These noodles work best with oriental seasonings and sauces. Obviously too delicate to stand up to heavy Italian sauces. I used Franks Sweet Pepper sauce with shrimp and oriental veggies and it was delicious!

review/text: I had to soak this for at least 8-10 minutes before it became tender enough to use in the cooking process.  I do love rice noodles and cook them up regularly, they are usually thicker so this is a nice alternative if you wish to make a more delicate dish. These were ok in texture but a bit gummy if over cooked in sauce. I made a black bean and pepper dish which was good as a side. Nice sized bag for 2 people for main dish or you can use twice for side dishes.

review/summary: instructions were wrong
review/text: The instructions on this package state that it needs to be soaked in luke warm water for 1 minute before serving.  I was skeptical this would work and should have listened to my gut.  After 1 minute soaking it tasted like uncooked pasta  I left it to soak for 10 minutes with no improvement.  Other rice noodles I've worked with need to be either cooked for a few minutes or soaked in hot water, which I definitely would have tried if I hadn't used it all with the first method (I only had one bag to sample).  So buyer beware that the cooking instructions are wrong.<br /><br />Otherwise it seemed like it would be a good product if it were properly prepared.  Peacock should do a little taste testing and redo the instructions and they would probably have a great product.

review/text: I have been drinking Cafe Bustelo for a couple years, upon the recommendation of an ex-barista friend of mine. It appeals to me on two levels: 1) incredible richness of flavor (even the decaf) 2) darned cheap.<br /><br />I use a wide variety of beans for my coffee and espresso, some expensive ($15 a 10oz can) -- but Bustelo is up in my top two (alongside Illy).  It is always a mile down the street at the supermarket when I need it at a cheap $4.00.  Amazing crema when you make espresso.  Great for a super strong iced coffee.  Also wonderful in a French press.<br /><br />You really can't go wrong.<br /><br />Specifically, Bustelo Decaf if top-notch.  I struggle with insomnia, therefore I avoid caffeine after noon-time.  But, I want my double-shot when I get home from work.  Bustelo Decaf is my after-work grind of choice!<br /><br />Works amazingly in my Breville Roma Espresso Machine --see review if you are looking for a great, inexpensive machine.<br /><br />Check out my food blog [...]

review/summary: The best, absolutely, by far
review/text: Every single person who loves a rich, complex, full-bodied coffee (not the "morning blend" types) has said they LOVE my coffee, even those who insist they don't like decaf coffee.  I only drink decaf, and this is hands-down the very best I've ever tasted anywhere.  Biggest problem for me is that it raises the bar, and I rarely enjoy coffee anywhere else but at home!<br /><br />Even though it's called espresso, I use this as others use regular coffee (one scoop/tablespoon per cup) in a drip coffeemaker... YUM!<br /><br />Glad to see Amazon offering it in case it becomes impossible to find locally (it can be hard sometimes - seems I'm not the only one in love with it who buys several cans at at time).  But be aware that they're charging a premium here and you should be able to find it for under $4.00/can in your grocery store IF they carry it.  Check in the Spanish/Mexican section if it's not in the regular coffee section...

review/summary: Four stars for price/drinkability combo
review/text: I think this is a good decaf for the price. That said, it's not great. I've had better decaf, just not at this price. I bought the four-pack because I love the regular Cafe Bustelo but my supermarket didn't carry the decaf. The decaf is not up to the standard of the regular, but it's good, and who can afford to pay $12+ per pound for the really good stuff all the time? Not moi.

review/text: Very nice flavor - rich, but not bitter. It is ground very fine, which makes it a good choice if you have a Senseo. It's more full-bodied than Mellita (my other favorite ground decaf) but slightly more acidic. Oh the other hand, it is priced better (I get it at Wegmans for a very nice price).<br /><br />Highly recommend if you like rich-tasting decaf.

review/summary: YUK!!!!
review/text: If you like the flavor of cardboard, then you will like this because that's what it tastes like. I like coffees that are strong flavored...this is not it as it has little flavor at all.  I guess the saying is true..."You get what you pay for" price is cheap and it tastes cheap.  I'm sorry I bought it.  Please contact me if you would like one opened can and one sealed can and I'll give it to you for free.  Actually, I wouldn't want to give this to a homeless person because I'd hate to put them through the unpleasant taste.  Surprising to see some people said they like it.  Wish I could have agreed with them.  Opened one of the cans, it didn't even leave an aroma which was my first clue that it would probably not even have a pleasant taste.  Then I tried several varied amounts in the brewing process thinking that eventually I would get a decent tasting cup of coffee.....NO SUCH LUCK!!! I ordered based on the other reviews here on Amazon.  Worst coffee I've ever tasted and comes close to the taste of coffee aboard some NAVY ships where the coffee has been brewing for about 5 hours or more.  I strongly recommend others to avoid this brand and try something else.<br />I normally like to use whole beans and ground them myself...this is the first step to making truly flavorful coffee. If you use paper filters, let a cup of water run through them then empty the carafe and then put your freshly ground beans in the filter and brew. This process takes out the mill-dust that all paper filters have in them which will taint the flavor of the coffee if you don't do this process. As for store brand coffee, I would recommend the selection at Kroger called Spotlight or the other called Private Select. A good non generic store brand coffee is Community Coffee. If you are fortunate to have a Central Market grocery store near you, try the fine selection of whole bean coffees.

review/summary: Most Amazing Sugar-Free Syrup Yet!
review/text: I recently bought a sno-cone machine to help me cut back on calories yet cool me off when the weather heats up over 100 degrees outside. To save even more calories, I wanted to use sugar-free syrups. I have tried the Back to Basics Sugar-free syrups and they are pretty watered down tasting. I was pleasantly surprised how sweet and tasty the Jelly Belly Sugar-Free Apple was! I am in love and will be buying the 3 pack next time to save money.

I noticed there were a number of manufacturers making sugar-free snow cone syrups, but I chose Jelly Belly because I assumed that they would make a great-tasting syrup.  I was not dissappointed.  This one tasted as good as I have ever tasted a sugar-free product.  I have since ordered several other of their sugar-free flavors.  Thank you Jelly Belly.

review/summary: ~*~*~My Girls LOVE these, PERFECT SIZE for Little Fingers~*~*~
review/text: When we first started giving these to our daughters we had to keep a very close eye on them(as with any solid food) because sometimes they would start choking and we would have to stick our fingers in their mouths and get these out.<br /><br />These do 'dissolve' pretty easily but your baby may take a little getting used to eating them like mine did. But in no time they knew how to eat these with OUT choking. I think at first they were just trying to swallow them before they got wet and 'dissolved'.<br /><br />We have bought Walmart Store Brand & these Gerber Puffs. Walmart Brand is Good but Gerber brand is GREAT! The Gerber Puffs are bigger making them easier for tiny fingers to pick them up, yet they are still a small enough size for them to eat. Walmart Brand have a lot of broken pieces so many of the pieces are tiny and my girls can't pick them up to eat them, I don't know that I have ever found a broken Gerber piece. I think Gerber stays fresh longer, it seems not too long after I open a Walmart Brand they are stale feeling.<br /><br />Since I have twins we go through these fast so we've found it much cheaper to order them in bulk.<br /><br />These keep my girls happy while my husband and I eat or get things done. Even if I have just fed my girls, if they see us eating they will have a fit. We put some puffs on their walker or high chair trays and they are Happy again. We even pour these in their play pen & they don't even make a mess. At a restaurant if my girls are getting fussy, we'll keep giving them puffs and they are happy. We give them puffs while we are heating their food, if not they'll normally throw fits until we are feeding them.<br /><br />We've tried the Gerber flavors: Bananna, Strawberry/Apple, Apple Cinnamon & my girls love them all.

review/text: Our little grandson loves his Gerber Sweet Potato Puffs. Sprinkle some on the table before him and he'll immediately start grabbing for them and putting them in his mouth. I like that they dissolve so readily, making them a safe non-choking hazard. The taste is actually pretty good though to me they taste more like orange than sweet potato.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it's not a major one, is that there is more sugar in the puffs than sweet potato. Yet, with only one gram of sugar in a half cup serving, this minor sin is forgivable.

review/summary: Good for a Teething Baby.
review/text: Our 11-month-old boy is teething and starting on solid foods. We've been giving him more and more solids for a number of months now. You'd be amazed at the things he loves to eat, such as french fries for example. In any case, my wife found Gerber's Graduates in a variety of forms and the boy seems to like them all to one degree or another.<br /><br />One of the varieties our boy likes is the Graduates puffs. They come in several flavors and the present ones we have are the apple-cinnamon. Previously we had some banana-flavored ones. In any case, the  specific flavor seems to make little difference. The little puffs are about 3/8 inch across and are star shaped. We give them to the boy one at a time, which gets somewhat tiresome. So, we place a small handful on his high-chair tray now and then. He attempts to get them all in his hand and then put them all in his mouth at the same time. What are you gonna do? He seems to like chewing them up, as best as he can, and we've had no problems with him choking or anything like that. It's a good product, but we, and the boy, prefer the Cheeto-like larger crunchies.<br /><br />Gary Peterson.

review/text: I'm 21, but these are great snacks even for adults! I first tried them when my nephew was a toddler. My sister got him these all the time because he loved them. She told me "Try one for yourself. They're really good" so I did. They melt in your mouth within seconds, so this is great for toddlers and babies who can't chew very well yet. As for myself, I'm a constant snacker, so these are a great alternative for me so I don't gain weight. They have vitamin E, Zinc, Iron, and Calcium in them. This is great nutrition for your toddler or baby ... and myself as well I suppose haha.<br /><br />So far I have only tried Strawberry apple and banana. They truly do taste like their flavors they say they are. This is another reason it is a great snack for your little ones. It'll help cause a much easier transition from these to the real thing (real strawberries, apples, and bananas I mean).<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. It's great =)

As the baby drools on his hands or loses a half-eaten puff, it leaves a bright orange stain on clothing, rugs, etc.  Not easy to get out, and a lot of the other flavors are more neutral colored and do not stain as much as the sweet potato.  The last thing I want to do is have to wash his highchair cover and straps, rugs, clothes, etc because of bright orange stains all around.<br />-cheaper versions available (ie, at Target they have their own brands)<br />-does have sugar (I wish they can make a low or non-sugar version, because I'm pretty sure the baby will still eat them.  Why add unnecessary sugar into everything?)<br /><br />I started with the Gerber sweet potato, but I'll be sticking to the Target blueberry (because it's cheaper and doesn't stain)

review/summary: One of my son's favorites
review/text: These puffs are great for a snack for my toddler. He loves all the flavors of these, but banana most of all. My husband and I even tried one ourselves to see what they were like. In my opinion, the banana aroma is much stronger than the flavoring. It's not a bad thing, there's just a very strong aroma of bananas when you open the container, so if I hadn't tried these myself, I would assume my son is getting a flavor (sugar) overload. That is NOT the case. There is just enough flavoring to make these good. My husband (who HATES fruit of any kind and refuses to eat it) actually said these weren't bad. Coming from him, that's a huge compliment.

review/summary: not my baby's favorite
review/text: i should have tried this flavor before buying bulk here.  my daughter loves puffs in general and she really liked the sweet potato ones we got before this one.  but the apple cinnamon flavor is a little too 'artificial' and strong. instead of grabbing them by the handful, she doesn't seem too interested to eat these..

review/summary: Developmental tool for feeding
review/text: My son has developmental delays, and these little puffs help with his fine motor skills. AND they taste good! I signed up for Amazon's subscribe and save and get 6 cans at a time. It saves me from running to the store to get them every week. They are also cheaper from Amazon with this program. The sweet potato flavor is sweet, but not too sweet. We've also tried the banana which has a "real" taste to it, rather than an artificial one.

review/text: My baby (13 months) loves this flavor of Gerber Puffs. The flavor is mild and the texture is really easy for her to chew now. I've actually been giving my baby Puffs since she was about 5 months old and had no teeth. We've tried and approved of Strawberry+Apple, Banana, Sweet Potato and of course this one. We also tried and dislike Apple cinnamon (too sweet) and Cherry (too tart).

review/summary: Puffs Are Great For Early Self-Feeders.
review/text: These little snacks are wonderful for little ones learning to self feed. They almost instantly melt in your mouth and I feel that under supervision pose very little choking risk. I had tried many things before these, from Cheerios to Nilla Wafers (crushed up) and nothing was even worth comparing to these puffs.  The sweet potato flavor is also very tasty, and my little one eats them up as fast as I let her!

review/summary: Taste great, not messy
review/text: My daughter officially gives these 5 stars - she just loves them.  These were her first finger food, and they remain her favorite.  I'll add my own 5 stars because they're an easy, convenient snack, and unlike Cheerios, they don't make a mess when the child is just learning to eat (the Cheerios were dribbling out of her mouth and onto her clothes); I suspect it's because the fruit puffs dissolve more quickly.  I'm not crazy about the price - 1.48 oz. isn't exactly a huge amount - but on the other hand, I don't give her that many, so a canister lasts a few weeks (vs. the recommended six servings).  Giving it in smaller quantities should also alleviate concerns about sugar in the product (sugar is the fifth ingredient in the banana puffs).

review/summary: good flavor, melts in her mouth
review/text: When my baby got too big to eat mashed sweet potato--and didn't have teeth to eat it otherwise--I started giving her these. She loved the taste and the texture was crunchy enough to soothe her teething gums while still being soft enough to dissolve easily in her mouth. They're also a really great finger food. I put some in her tray and she'll eat as many as she wants and drop the rest on the floor, which we pick up and put in the bird feeder. Incidentally, the birds enjoy them too :)

review/summary: Stain clothing
review/text: This is a good idea, and they dissolve quickly for babies new to food. But if a partially slobbered on one falls out of the baby's mouth and onto clothing it leaves a stain that proves impossible to remove. The puffs have a bit of an orange coating on them, it must contain food coloring. I've tried organic puffs and they don't leave any stains.

review/summary: Tasty, but very sweet
review/text: I bought these because I like the idea of a veggie flavor over a fruit flavor.  They really are delicious, but they are very sweet.  They taste a lot like a kids cereal (which they kind of are).  I prefer the Plum and Happy Baby ones because they have half the sugar, and my 11 month old doesn't mind.  If I try to mix the low sugar ones with the Gerber, she will go for the Gerber.  If you don't care about the sugar increase (it is really small), these are tasty and your child will eat them.  If you care about sugar, go with Happy Baby.

review/summary: A good choice for new crunchers and munchers!
review/text: I was pretty wild about these for awhile when my little guy started eating solid food; they dissolve easily and he has fun picking them up. If I put a bunch in his tray, he'll try to shovel them in, but if I put one at a time down he'll pick them up with a thumb and finger. He's fun to watch, learning new things.<br /><br />I do worry about the added sugar, so I've been holding back a little on these lately, offering them less often and giving him Cheerios instead. The Gerber/Nestle corn crunchies are a little up in the sodium, too. Kid snacks don't need that stuff, really, so I'm looking for alternatives, but I think these will still be around at our house for awhile; everything in moderation. :)

review/summary: perfect first finger food
review/text: We used this as a first finger food with our twins and broke them into even smaller pieces.  Our babies had lots of teeth by 8 months, so they were able to chew.  The puffs melt down when sucked on, so it's a great first "real food" for the little ones.  The sweet potato is not "too sweet" as most of the other flavors are.  Even my older kids (ages 5 and 7) like to snack on these.  I never go anywhere in the car without them.  The star shape seems to be easier for the babies to get to their own mouths when just learning to self feed.

All was well until I removed him from his high chair and saw orange spots everywhere. He is learning to self feed and drools quite a bit so I when he was grabbing at them with his wet hands some of the puffs on the tray got wet. When I went to clean off the tray the puffs came off but everywhere there was a wet puff I now have an orange stain. I wouldn't be so mad of there was some kind of warning on the jar but I can't find one. I am really glad he was shirtless or I can't imagine what his clothes would look like.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I was going to buy this product here at Amazon but when I found it at my local supermarket on sale for $2.99 (as opposed to $8.75 per package here on Amazon), I bought it.  In short, this is a great product.  Overall, it has a very good flavor and did not notice any of that artificial or tinny after taste that some do.<br /><br />As stated above, I found this on sale.  Its regular shelf price was $3.99.  So, where the $34.98 (for 4 packages) comes from, I have no idea.  It is, also, really economical and "green" minded.  Each little tub, reconstituted as suggested on the package, yields 3 1/2 cups of stock.  That is one ounce short of 2 cans of broth from the grocery store and 4 ounces short of one of those 32 ounce cartons.  So, one little 4-tub package represents almost 8(!) cans (at 37 1/2 cents per can) or 4 packages (at 75 cents per package) and taking up a small fraction of the shelf space.  What is better is that this is stock, not broth.  So, there is a more complex flavor profile.  Also, I am thinking of taking them from my pantry and keeping them in my freezer in an effort to extend their shelf life.  Bravo Knorr!!

review/summary: Mmm... Banana!
review/text: While they aren't my favorite fruits, I do enjoy bananas and I keep them on hand because I love to add them to my smoothies (I usually add a heaping teaspoon or two of Matcha to all my smoothies too).<br /><br />This matcha has a delicious banana-y flavor that isn't too sweet.  The sweetness is from the fruit flavor and the Matcha itself, but it doesn't taste candy sweet, at least, not to me ... although it does smell like banana candy when you first open the package and all the while during preparation.  But, I don't get that sort of taste from the Matcha and that's a good thing, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />The matcha does taste a little different with the banana flavoring.  The normal vegetative tones of the matcha meld with the flavor of the banana ... the fruity notes of the banana ... in such a way that the vegetal notes seem to disappear and become more fruity.  The lovely, creamy, buttery tones are still there, and it still tastes like Matcha... but it's not veggie or grassy tasting like some Matcha can taste.<br /><br />I like!

review/summary: Do you Remember Circus Peanuts??
review/text: This is one of those matcha that you will want to have around for the kids, their friends, and when you want to make smoothies, or have a sweet treat. Its not my favorite from Red Leaf but its not bad at all it just reminds me of circus peanuts. Do you remember those things? Sort of like slightly hardened dried out marshmallow like candies. We used to get them at the dime store. Remember when we had "dime stores" ... haha anyway I do enjoy this tea - takes me back to the good ol days, and really where they all THAT good? Oh well the point is - this is some good stuff and I do like it but its more of a banana candy like flavor rather than fresh ripe banana but at the same time I just don't know how natural of a banana flavor one could possibly get - I don't know if I have ever had a better banana flavor in a tea or anything else for that matter that was not a banana itself. I think that banana flavored things always tend to have that slightly strange flavor to it.<br />Now, this is where things get really good ... I mixed my banana matcha with macadamia nut matcha to make a banana nut like matcha and it was excellent! Made a smoothie out of it that way too! It was QUITE yummy!

review/summary: Great stuff, not really hot though
review/text: The Tanka Bites (Spicy Pepper) are different than jerky:<br />No MSG and no nitrates commonly found in "processed" meats, no corn syrup, no gluten binder, no high fructose corn sugar or even corn sugar, no raw sugar. My understanding is this makes the product compatible with the "Paleo" diet (so I'm assuming they can not claim this without testing or licensing of that trademark).<br /><br />If you're more interested in the "sustainable" aspects, well, it's buffalo... which is usually farmed more sustain-ably than factory beef. As mentioned above it doesn't contain corn by products.<br /><br />If you pause at the price, well, you are paying for a product that has none of the cost saving shortcuts found in the mass produced stuff.<br /><br />How's the taste?<br />Well, they're very moist - no rawhide pulling against your teeth experience.<br />On the balance these are sweet and tart.<br />There's mild heat from the peppers, but the peppers are used sparingly.<br />I was a little let down... the "hot" on the packaging, and the habanero + jalapeno ingredients led me to believe it WAS hot.<br />I've had hot beef jerky before and this doesn't even come close... I'd say this is medium spicy.<br />I'll still order these again - they're good - but they need to remove the "hot" claim from the packaging (and save it for a future product that really IS hot).

review/text: I've been trying to avoid gluten and be more soy free, and I Tanka Bites is one of the few snacks out there that fills this need, while also delivering a good amount of protein.<br /><br />I'm not generally a fan of cranberries, but in this case, it works pretty well. In terms of quantity/price, this is a better deal than the jerky sticks so this is where I would go.

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: This is a great low calorie snack. I didn't find the Tanka Bites to be that spicy.  Then again, I love spicy food so maybe it's just me. Also, I love that it's an American product, supports Native American entrepreneurs and comes from grass fed buffalo (not feed lot confined and fed). I'll definitely be ordering again.

review/summary: nothing else like it!
review/text: This is the sort of jerky a back-sliding vegetarian could love; lean buffalo, raised in the wild, no chemicals, cranberries...not too salty. OK, I've decided, this stuff is great!!

review/summary: Tanka Bites, Spicy
review/text: These are tasty with a nice bite.  The cranberry takes the edge off the spice.  However, too expensive. There are other healthy options.

review/summary: Disgusting
review/text: This is made of processed meat. As you bite into it, fat leaks off of it. Going to anonymously "forget" it at work.<br />I've bought about 1,000. products of Amazon. And this is my first review.  It's THAT bad! Shipping and such was fine though...
