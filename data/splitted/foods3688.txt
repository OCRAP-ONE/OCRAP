review/summary: Not even CLOSE to Lemon Coolers
review/text: These are absolutely terrible! I remember Lemon Coolers. These are a complete joke. They taste like fat. OK, grease. Whatever.  Absolutely no zing, no lemon flavor at all. Kroger has just come out with a lemon cookie - can find them in the same area as Vanilla Wafers, as that's pretty much what they look like.  They are a lot more lemony and flavorful in general, and my resourceful fiancee took a few and spritzed them with water, rolled them in confectioner's sugar, and they were a LOT closer to the original Lemon Coolers than these ridiculous discs of disappointment.

review/summary: Can't cook Japanese without it
review/text: The basic stock for 1,000s of Japanese recipes, dashi is absolutely essential for anyone wanting to cook authentic Japanese cuisine.  As famous chef Shizuo Tsuji once said " "many substitutes for dashi are possible, but without dashi, dishes are merely a la japonaise and lack the authentic flavor".<br /><br />Dashi can be made pretty easily from scratch, boiling some kombu or katsuobushi shavings, but you often make far more than you need for the particular recipe, and it can be a pain to spend all that time boiling.  Instant dashi does the trick just fine, and almost no one will notice the substitution.  This kind here, "Hon Dashi" (meaing "Real Dashi"), is the cream of the crop of instant substitutes.  Made by the company Ajinomoto, Hon Dashi is absolutely brimming with umami, the fifth basic flavor found in Asian cooking.  Hon Dashi is made from katsuobushi shavings, so it is a basic fish stock and not suitable for vegans, who would probably want to make their own kombu stock.<br /><br />I use Hon Dashi for almost everything, from basic miso soup, to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WJSP9C">tamagoyaki</a>, to using it to boil vegetables and give them a heartier flavor.  Along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YB210">mirin</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YB3ZK">soy sauce</a>, it is one of the most basic ingredients in a Japanese kitchen.

review/summary: Just what my miso was missing
review/text: My best friend returned to Japan and I felt that unless I went to a Japanese restaurant, I would never, ever have real miso soup.<br /><br />I tried every paste, every color. I tried making my miso with and without wakame; I even tried mixing the pastes and still could not get it right.<br /><br />I FINALLY got it! I didn't even intend to order Hon Dashi, had it on my wish list, but it was the best mistake I could make.<br /><br />I'll be experimenting with my dashi to see what else I can add it to. The smokey flavor is superb.

review/summary: Ajinomoto Hon Dashi
review/text: I buy this locally in a much larger box but it is the same product.  This product is just as good as making your own, which I did for years before finding it.  The larger box has 1,000 servings but that is for a weak dashi so I use double the granules.  For this product with the 3 packets, just add them into a small jar and use 1 ts per cup hot water (adjust to your tastes).  That adjustment is why it says '3 to 6 cups'.  Also, this product stores with no loss in flavor in a sealed container for years.  I actually have some in a salt shaker (with rice to keep it dry) and use it commonly as a flavor boost to vegetables (green ones especially work well with it).<br /><br />This is actually a good starter size box.  For those not sure what to do with it, a sample recipe:<br /><br />3 cups made up dashi (1 packet)- taste and add water if you wish it weaker.<br />1 packet Udon noodles (may use cooked spagetti) appx 1.25 cups volume<br />1 cup lightly packed leafy vegetables (spinach, mustard greens, cabbages etc)<br />Optional- baby bok choys whole, shellfish (whole or chopped), peeled shrimp, miso<br /><br />Bring to a simmer and as soon as the veggies and optional meats are done to your liking, it's ready.  This is the 'kitchen sink' soup of Japan, meaning just about anything might land in there though the items are normally pre-cooked leftover bits.

review/summary: Very Good Dashi - Makes Great Homemade Miso Soup!
review/text: I am very happy with this dashi.  I like that I can use it to make just a small amount of stock if a recipe calls for it, and it also makes an excellent miso soup without having to get take-out every time I happen to crave some. (For two servings I use 1 tsp dashi powder, 3 cups water, 2 big tbsp miso paste - plus add-ins like onion, tofu, etc. It's really good!) This is a good value too - a box this size will last me a long time.  Inside the box there are 3 foil packets to help it stay fresh.  They do recommend refridgeration of the opened portion, but the rest can stay on a shelf.<br /><br />Although salt is listed first on the ingredient list, the sodium level in this product is not very high.  Which is good considering the amount of sodium that other Japanese ingredients tend to have in them. It's important to remember that ingredients are listed by weight: salt is going to weigh much more than the dried fish flakes.

review/summary: Excellent bonito soup stock
review/text: Most chefs would probably prefer to make their own soup stock. However,if you're in a pinch an instant soup stock can be a life saver. If you want to make some tasty dashi fast than Ajinomoto's excellent HonDashi can be your savior. The flavor is there and HonDashi is so easy to use.<br /><br />Each box contains 3 bags. Nutrition facts and a serving suggestion are listed on the back of the box. 150g of HonDashi should take you a long way. Ajinomoto recommends 4g for 4 servings.<br /><br />HonDashi is an excellent product from a very reliable company.

review/summary: Should have read the bad review first.
review/text: Just back from a trip to Japan, hungry for some good nabeyaki udon, I ordered this stock. There's got to be something better on the market. I love salt, and dashi should be salty, but not overwhelmingly so. And why sugar, let alone two or three types of sugar? While I don't have a problem with MSG myself, I do try to avoid it. Probably my own fault; I should have specified "No MSG", except it never occurred to me that a package with this many bad chemicals wouldn't be labelled somewhere!<br />Outside of any of this, the dashi has none of the complexity or subtlety you hope for in a dashi base. I know if I want all of that, I need to make it from scratch, but since purchasing this I've tried several non-MSG brands and all of them are better. Sad to say, because Ajinomoto is a venerable company, but stick with Maruhachi or one of the other, healthier brands!

review/summary: Loaded with MSG
review/text: I haven't even tried this stuff yet, but with the first ingredient being salt, the second being MSG, then finally the third being dried bonito powder, then the next sugar, then dextrose(more sugar)...then some chemicals(disodium inosinate, disodium succinate), which sound like more salt or preservatives, or both...WTF? None of the other reviews even mention this marvelous combination of lousy ingredients...kinda stupid. If I'd wanted 3 packets of sugar, salt, and flavor enhancers....I'd have ordered salty/sugared MSG soup base.<br /><br />UPDATE: I did some research and I thought this was interesting, and since this product, and the topic of MSG seems to be so bantered about, maybe this will be interesting to someone else.<br /><br />The food additive, monosodium glutamate, was first used in the United States in any quantity in the late 1940s. According to Dr. George Schwartz, author of In Bad Taste: The MSG Syndrome, although considerable effort had been spent to introduce MSG to the USA, little had been accomplished prior to World War II. However, sometime during the war, the use of MSG in Japanese soldiers' rations was noticed. In 1948, a symposium on MSG, presided over by the Chief Quartermaster of the Armed Forces, was held in Chicago for members of the food industry.<br />By the 1960s, Accent, the leading brand of the flavor enhancer called "monosodium glutamate," had become a household word. Simultaneously, other hydrolyzed protein products such as autolyzed yeast, sodium caseinate, and hydrolyzed vegetable protein gained in popularity. Every hydrolyzed protein product, regardless of the name given to it on a label, contains MSG.<br />Although glutamic acid had been isolated in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Ritthausen, it was not until 1908 that its flavor-enhancing potential was noticed by Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo, Japan. Prior to that time, the Japanese had used seaweed as a favorite flavor enhancer, without understanding that glutamic acid was its flavor-enhancing component.<br />From 1910 until 1956, the process underlying production of glutamic acid and "monosodium glutamate" in Japan was one of extraction, a slow and costly method. Elsewhere, crude gluten or other starting materials were hydrolyzed by heating with hydrochloric acid. In 1956, the Japanese succeeded in producing glutamic acid by means of fermentation; and after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, large-scale production of glutamic acid and "monosodium glutamate" through fermentation began.<br />Even before the Japanese discovered the flavor potential of processed free glutamic acid extracted from sea weed, the potential of freeing glutamic acid from protein using acid hydrolysis was being explored in Europe. At the time, however, the method was not widely used. Indeed, it was not until some time later that the flavor industry realized that various of their hydrolyzed protein products contained considerable amounts of processed free glutamic acid (MSG) -- the flavor-enhancing component of the food ingredient "monosodium glutamate" -- and production of hydrolyzed protein products for their flavor-enhancing potential escalated.<br />When "monosodium glutamate" was brought to the United States in the years following World War II it was still manufactured through extraction. By 1956, after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. had succeeded in producing glutamic acid through a method of bacterial fermentation wherein bacteria (some, if not all of which are genetically modified)(10) are grown aerobically in a liquid nutrient medium. These bacteria have the ability to synthesize glutamic acid outside of their cell membranes and excrete it into the medium to accumulate there.(11) It was in 1956 that truly large-scale production of glutamic acid and "monosodium glutamate" through fermentation began.<br />We find it fascinating that the first published report of a reaction to "monosodium glutamate" did not appear until "monosodium glutamate" was being made by bacterial fermentation. The first published report of a reaction to "monosodium glutamate" appeared in 1968 when Robert Ho Man Kwok, M.D., who had emigrated from China, reported that although he never had the problem in China, about 20 minutes into a meal at certain Chinese restaurants, he suffered numbness, tingling, and tightness of the chest that lasted for approximately 2 hours.<br />The following year, John W. Olney, M.D. reported that laboratory animals suffered brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders after being exposed to monosodium glutamate. Scientists studying retinal degeneration in mice treated with free glutamic acid had noted that these mice became grotesquely obese. Olney, who speculated that the obesity might be a sign of damage to the hypothalamus (the area of the brain that regulates a number of endocrine functions, including weight control), found that infant laboratory animals given free glutamic acid suffered brain damage immediately, and assorted neuroendocrine disorders later in life. Pharmaceutical grade L-glutamic acid was often used to produce these disorders until neuroscientists observed that monosodium glutamate, an inexpensive food additive, could be substituted for laboratory-grade free glutamic acid in these studies and produce the same effects.<br />In the years that followed, neuroscientists replicated the work of Olney, and Olney spoke out repeatedly about the toxic potential of monosodium glutamate. In 1972, for example, Olney testified before the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs that ingestion of MSG places humans at risk, with the greatest risk being for the very young; and that a National Academy of Science panel organized to determine whether MSG ought to be banned from baby food had produced an "industry arranged whitewash" by a group of scientists with almost no experience in neuropathology. In the early 1970s, manufacturers of baby food voluntarily removed the monosodium glutamate from their products, but replaced the monosodium glutamate with MSG-containing ingredients such as autolyzed yeast and hydrolyzed vegetable protein. In the late 1970s, manufacturers "voluntarily" removed all obvious MSG-containing ingredients from baby food.<br />Use of MSG in food has grown in the last 30 years and is still growing. MSG is found in most soups, salad dressings, processed meats, frozen entrees, ice cream, and frozen yogurt, in some crackers, bread, canned tuna, and very often in "low fat" and "no fat" foods to make up for flavor lost when fat is reduced or eliminated. It can be found in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements. It is found in enteral feeding products and in infant formula. It is found in vaccines -- including vaccines used on children. It is found in hospitals where it is hidden in the jello, chicken soup, and some IV solutions given to very sick patients.<br />Very often manufacturers use hydrolyzed protein products as MSG-containing flavor enhancers instead of using "monosodium glutamate." In the industry, an ingredient that contains MSG but is not necessarily recognized by consumers as containing MSG is called a "clean label" ingredient.

review/text: Good taste and texture (a bit high on sodium: 460 mg; otoh, kippered herring can't be salt-free, so it's not too bad.). Provides 1.0 g Omega-3 EFA per serving (one serving per can). Total fat: 8 g; Saturated 2.0g; Trans fat 0 g; Polyunsat. 1.5g; Monounsat: 4g; Cholesterol 65 mg; Protein 16g.<br /><br />That said, there really is a good reason ingredients are never available on online sites. Here they are:<br />- Herring fillets, water, salt, natural smoke flavoring, sodium hexametaphosphate.<br /><br />The last one is, I quote from Healthy Eating Politics (google for it), "an emulsifier, a sequestering agent, and texturizer. Prevents scale formation and corrosion. Acts to stabilize product and prevent changes in appearance and texture. [HERE COMES! --] May cause respiratory tract irritation. Symptoms may include coughing and shortness of breath. Some individuals may experience an allergic reaction to the ingestion of sodium hexametaphosphate that may produce mild chest pain. Also linked to pancreatic cancer in continual doses."<br /><br />So you decide if you want to eat that thing. Nice herring, but I don't think I will reorder.

review/text: While the taste was ok, i wish i had seen the ingredient list. I just had a case of polar kippers, with only salt added, and i assumed these would be the same.<br />the polar ones are better, but they went up in price , and the crown prince are good, but not as good as the polar.  But these - you can taste a chemical. ...and therefore...i would avoid them

review/summary: Terrific Wheatgrass!
review/text: Shipment arrived fast and in a nice, practical bucket. The wheat berries sprouted perfectly and grew quickly, thick and tall! I was a bit surprised as I'd never done anything like this before, and fully expected a few trial runs before getting it right. I used Ann Wigmore's sprouting technique, and the resulting juice was hearty and dark, though still sweet and great. Highly recommended! After a few trials, though, I would say be careful not to under water. I worried about molds and fungus on the third or fourth batch (tiny spots had begun showing up) and the grass suffered for it. More water means more, better grass.

My mom used to make this for me when I was little and when I couldn't find it at the stores I went online and was very happy to find it again. The instant puddings just do not do it for me. I make it with almond milk since I cannot tolerate dairy anymore and it still is MMMMMM-GOOD. (However,if you can tolerate dairy use milk because it does taste better). Online the minimum order is a whole case and that is ok by me!

review/text: I was so happy to find the cook and serve butterscotch here on Amazon. I wish they had it in the large size. Each pack uses only 2 cups of milk versus 3 cups for the chocolate or vanilla. It has been a good 30 years since I had the butterscotch pudding. I thought they quit making it as I have never seen it at any of the places I shop. Well, I got a case and it is now nearly finished. Tastes just like it used to. Also got a case of the chocolate but it is not as popular with my bunch. Rock on Amazon!

review/summary: Butterscotch pudding
review/text: I grew up with puddings that you had to cook.  "Instant" had not been invented, yet.  My husband knows I love butterscotch pudding, but could only find the instant kind.  I looked online and found the "cookable" kind, so ordered it. It is not a big deal to cook it. By doing so, that "instant" taste that comes with uncooked is not there. I think that it would have been even better had I used whole milk, but being "seniors" who need to watch the calories, this is as good as it gets(I used fat free milk). Buying 24 boxes at a time is not a problem - it comes in a "display" box, which is good for storage.

review/summary: Real cultured butter of high quality
review/text: I usually buy the salted version of this butter since I mostly use it for spreading and for that I like the flavor of the salted version better. That being said, there are a number of recipies that call for unsalted butter and then the unsalted Lurpak is as good as you will find.<br /><br />Note that Lurpak is cultured butter (not sweet cream butter like most American brands) and as such it has a deep and rich flavor that no simple sweet cream butter can match. Cultured butter of this kind is produced by fermenting the cream with lactic bacteria that convert sugars to lactic acid before churning the cream into butter.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with far more expensive butters. I actually prefer Lurpak over brands like Echire, etc.

review/summary: My former #1 butter...........
review/text: ....to be replaced by Plugra.<br /><br />I became a 'butterholic' after tasting free sample of Lurpak at room temp spread on crakers at Wild Oats years ago.<br /><br />I had thought that butter was butter, and this premium stuff was just marketing gimmick, NOT!<br /><br />Ever since lurpak became my regular butter, I started 'testing' other premium butters, so far none ever surpassed lurpak till I tried Plugra at Whole Foods.<br /><br />Lurpak has this smooth, but tangy taste I crave for.  It's an excellent butter to use on fancy Eurostyle bread with organic milk on mornings.  But it's not a 'cooking' butter, yes one can use lurpak for cooking, but it's really a waste of flavor and such premium price to boot.<br /><br />Eventually I found another premium butter that replaced lurpak, Plugra, made in USA, and cheaper than lurpak, and even more complex and nuanced flavor than lurpak.<br /><br />Even Cook's illustrated declared Plugra a superior butter than lurpak, its former favorite just like it used to be mine.

review/summary: Amazingly creamy!
review/text: Let me begin by saying that I've read all the reviews for this matcha, and although it sounds delicious, I never thought Bavarian Cream would be a flavour I crave. I love donuts with fillings, don't get me wrong, but they aren't something I jones for in the middle of the night. (I haven't been pregnant yet, so that could change! Haha). I guess what I'm trying to say is - I already have the Cheesecake Matcha, how amazing could Bavarian Cream be?<br /><br />The answer? Extremely amazing. Absolutely amazing. Exclaim it to the heavens!<br /><br />There's something about this flavour that took me by surprise and wooed me. The smell is sweet and creamy, no mistaking it for "vanilla" or something generic, it's quite a specific scent. The aroma is true to the taste, hallelujah! There's almost a "thickness" to it, and certainly a richness, that is reminiscent of its namesake. Creamy creamy creamy! The smell and taste of biting into that perfect area of donut where all the cream is. I personally like to save that part for the last, if I'm lucky. ;)<br /><br />Thankfully with this matcha, I get the best part all to myself!<br /><br />My personal favourite way to enjoy this matcha is as a hot latte with a pinch of sugar, to make the flavour pop and enhance the cream (if it can get any creamier - my goodness!). That said, I also shook it up in a water bottle and took it to work as an iced tea and again it really surprised me! No sugar added + true Bavarian Cream flavour = a happy Ash-Lee servicing customers with a buzz! Thanks Red Leaf Tea!

review/text: I love Bavarian cream, it's such a nice luscious flavor. Though a big part of the reason I like it is the texture--and surely, a matcha couldn't really capture that, right? Well once again Red Leaf proves that they cam turn ANY flavor into a matcha and make it work! This is creamy, dreamy, vanilla custard with of course a lovely hint of grassy green matcha in the background. But the feel is smooth, creamy, and luscious. It really is like Bavarian Cream in a cup! It's got that same smooth custard-like texture as their Cheesecake Matcha, but I think Bavarian Cream edges it out a bit in terms of my favorites. Highly recommended!

And while this probably isn't as strongly VANILLA as the other two might be (but I don't know that for sure because I haven't yet tried either one of them, but they're on my list to eventually try too!) this one takes creaminess to a whole other level.<br /><br />I mean, you get the creaminess from the Matcha too, and combine that with the custard-y creamy taste of the Bavarian Cream, along with good amount of vanilla flavor and OMG you have heaven in a tea bowl.<br /><br />So very good.  Luscious, creamy, sweet and decadent.  Perfect!

review/summary: A yummy treat without the hassle
review/text: I admit that my knowledge of Bavarian Cream is limited. I originally thought it was just a variation of vanilla. But apparently, it's more like a custard and quite popular in pastries. I personally try to avoid pastries since they are delicious but can also be calorie-laden and full of sugar. So it's nice when you can have a matcha instead that has the flavor without all the calories. Also, Bavarian cream seems like a hassle to make, so all the more reason to enjoy it in matcha form.<br /><br />I actually made this matcha iced and found it absolutely delicious. Normally I have to toss some milk in there to make it a little more drinkable, but this didn't need anything at all. The taste was very creamy and I could just detect the tiny bit of citrus. It's worth noting that if you do decide to chill your matcha this way, a lot of the powder sinks to the bottom, so you may have to froth it up again to get it to absorb.

review/text: I use this product regularly and prefer it over other "energy" drinks because it is easier to drink and I don't feel a "crash" after.

I also had an issue with receiving part of the order and was refunded right away - great product and great service.

Our Vet said it is allergies, but I felt his symptoms suggested it was hyperactive thyroid. I bought 1 bag of First Mate and all 3 cats thinned down, got shiny hair, and the hair is growing back on the one with problems.  It was too good to be true, because now I come back to purchase more and I find the price has DOUBLED:(

review/summary: Excellent Product..
review/text: We have two cats, one 4 years old and the other 5. Both are neutered males and we've had them since kittenhood. Of course, there's the litter box. Right from the start we picked up a big (40 pound) plastic container of Scoop Away at our local Costco Warehouse store and we've been using the brand ever since. Recently, Costco stopped carrying it and switched to Scoop Away Complete Performance cat litter, which supposedly has a variety of improvements and which comes in a large very tough plastic bag and weighs 42 pounds. Whew, that's a lot of litter but the bag is real sturdy and has a ziplock closure This new litter has been just excellent. It clumps into nice hard nodules and it's easy to clean the litter box. It has excellent odor control unless I forget to clean the box regularly, which I do at times. About the only complaint I might have is that the litter is somewhat dusty. This proves no problem with us in that the litter box is within 10 feet of the back door and we add litter by taking the box outside. Excellent Product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Dusty but gets the job done
review/text: For someone with a cat that somehow spawns devil poop that WILL suffocate you, this litter is awesome. I've tried about 4-5 different brands and finally tried Scoop Away. So far it's been the only litter to really get rid of/mask the scent and do its job. It clumps when it's supposed to, it's light but not so light that it'll get tracked around, and it lasts a long time! An added bonus that my cat loves it and purrs whenever he goes in it.<br /><br />The only things I do not like are that the box isn't the most convenient design and it's a bit dusty. With the box, there's a perforated line at the top side where you push your opening for the litter.. if you don't push it outwards, the litter get trapped behind the box and then you have to hold the flap so that the litter can actually come out. And it's a small opening so when you're refilling a whole litter box, it's not the most efficient. And when you first pour it out, the litter is dusty but it settles almost instantly and you're not going to be covered in a layer of dust and neither will your floor or furniture. I personally don't think it smells bad either, I think the scent is relatively fresh, and it's not an overwhelming odor either.<br /><br />This litter really does work. I definitely recommend it and have not dared to try a different brand since switching to Scoop Away.

review/text: Fast shipping, great price. Scoop away is the only cat litter i use, the wee clumps so it's easy to pick up with the scooper. The scent of the cat litter is not as strong as some people are saying, but you cannot smell the cats mess. No matter how many times i pass by the cat litter it doesn't smell bad at all. The only con is when the cat leaves the cat litter and the small trace of litter on the floor gets kind of hard to clean up.

review/summary: Excellent for odor, terrible for dust!
review/text: Our little dude has arthritis now and since this developed, we've had to move his litter box to the first floor of the house.  So, when I found that this stuff totally kills the odors, I grabbed a box since Tidy Cats had begun to fail in the odor task immensely.  Quite honestly, I've NEVER had a litter that completely, totally, without a trace, ridded the air of all kitty odors.  This stuff, hands down, is the BEST I've ever tried.  There's absolutely NO odor whatsoever!  It's just a bit weird how you just do not smell anythiing at all.  However, don't have your cat sitting there waiting while you're filling the box.  As good as this is at clumping, odor control, and great smell, it's TERRIBLE for dust!  It just blows all over the place and I actually have to turn on the fan in the bathroom to get rid of it.  Why they can't get this without the dust by now is beyond me.  But, if you live in a small space and need the odor control, this is your litter.  Just get out the Swiffer and be prepared to dust.  Recommend highly, but with the above condition.

review/text: I just got my cat from a shelter in May 2011, so were still figuring what works ie food & litter. I used to use Tidy Cat but she would track it everywhere & it had a hard time clumping. So I bought this on a whim & love it. It does have a strong fragrant smell & is rather dusty but I don't mind the smell & a little dust when changing litter is better than having litter residue everywhere. Also this clumps really well so its easier to clean the box and it seems longer lasting so I use a lot less.<br />Pros<br />Good price<br />Doesn't 'track' as bad<br />Clumps well<br />Covers odors well<br /><br />Cons<br />Can be dusty when changing box<br />Heavy perfume smell (which I like) but if your smell sensitive your cat will smell like this after using the box.

review/text: I use this litter with an automatic litter box and it works wonders!  It clumps HARD, so it clears away clean and leaves no odor behind.  It is a bit dusty if you pour a bunch all at once, but I don't find it to be any worse than others that I've tried. I have on occasion, tried another brand of litter, and have always been severely disappointed.  I highly recommend this litter - especially if you have an automatic litter box!

review/summary: Hernia Inducing Cat Litter
review/text: I used Fresh Step and Scoop Away cat litters for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that they were the best "bang for the buck" litters. They clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, they form a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase one of these litters. Both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!

review/summary: Would not recommend, cats don't like strong scent...
review/text: First the good:  this cat litter is decently priced, clumps fairly well, and is finer than other litters (cats tend to like fine litters better).<br /><br />The bad:  the scent is very strong.  People may not notice it as much but cats have a lot more sensitive noses and they can definitely tell.  In my experience from using this with many cats at our local animal shelter, only the more picky ones have actually gone outside of their litterbox rather than use this litter, but the majority don't like it and try to stay on the opposite side of the cage.  Cats really prefer unscented litter, and this is one of the more smelly litters we have tried.  This litter is also a little more dusty than other litters.<br /><br />Because of its strong scent, it does do a good job of masking odor.  It basically comes down to your need to mask odor versus your cat's comfort.  At the animal shelter, the cats' comfort is our priority, so we choose not to use this litter.  Overall, I would not recommend buying this litter unless your cat isn't picky at all.

review/summary: How Do You Do That Doo Doo That You Do So Well?
review/text: I LOVE this product!  If you have Cats and you use Cat Litter then this is the product for you!  I have used Scoop Away for several years now with great results! The odor control is much better than higher priced brands such as Fresh Step or Tidy Cats.  I have previously used Tidy Cats crystal litter (which is supposed to have superior odor control); however the odor control for Tidy Cats crystal litter pales in comparison to Scoop Away!  Also one item worthy of mention is that while this brand may often times cost less than other Cat Litter brands; it is not a discount brand.  Scoop Away is a great quality brand that provides you with better quality and value than the more popular brands.<br /><br />Cat Litter in general is something that has to be maintained often, regardless of what brand is best for you.  I recommend scooping your Cat Litter a minimum of twice a day, more often if possible.  Scooping your litter often will help with odor control.<br /><br />The style of Litter Box I prefer is a covered Litter pan with an open lid.<br />I usually buy the style of Litter Box that has the pan cover with a flap opening, though I always remove the flap.  While the flap will help with odor control, it seems for some reason to be very irritating to the oldest Cat.  I always buy the style of Litter Box that accommodates the air filters as well, though I have found them to not do much of anything for Litter Box odor.  The best thing for overall Litter Box odor control is Scoop Away Cat Litter.<br /><br />A lot of Vets and Cat experts recommend having one more litter box than the number of Cats you have.  We have 4 Cats and three litter boxes.  I scoop the litter a minimum of twice a day.<br /><br /> Our Cats are indoor Cats, if your Cat is mostly outdoors or indoor/outdoor then you may not have to scoop and change the litter as often.<br />I prefer to put about 17lbs. of litter in each Litter Box when changing the litter.  You may need more or less depending on the number of Cats you own, as well as the size of your Cats.<br /><br />Of the different verities of Scoop Away available, I highly recommend the Multi-Cat scented formula, even if you only have one Cat!  The Multi Cat scented formula will give you the best possible odor control.  If your Cat has allergies or is sensitive to scented Cat Litter, then I would suggest one of the non-scented verities.<br /><br />Whatever Cat Litter you decide to provide for your Cat, I again suggest that you use Scoop Away!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ASCGC">Van Ness CP6 Enclosed Cat Pan/Litter Box, Large</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ASCGM">Van Ness  CP7 Enclosed Cat Pan/Litter Box, Extra Large</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U8L8NO">Pureness Ebytra Giant Translucent Enclosed Cat Litter Pan, Assorted Colors</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004N1T3B4">Natures Miracle Odor Control Universal Charcoal Filter, 2-Pack</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057XOOCK">JMK 07065 Pet Scoop - Various Colors</a>

review/text: When I first bought this kitty litter I was very surprised with the strong smell it had, and was worried that the cats wouldn't use it because it was so perfumey. They use it just fine though, with no problems.<br /><br />I didn't notice that it's any dustier than any other kitty litter I've used, but maybe I'm just oblivious?<br /><br />And I didn't notice the smell clinging to the cats either, but I don't let the cats climb all over me right out of the litter box anyway.<br /><br />All in all, I approve of the strong perfumey smell over a regular litter box smell any day and it clumps very well, so I give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Perfect blend of smooth and spicy
review/text: This tea is wonderful to drink anytime. It doesn't have the tannin-bitterness of a green or black tea, and the blending of juicy peach and ginger bite, are amazing. I have tried many flavored teas...including the other Bentley flavors and this one is by far my favorite.

review/text: This is a wonderful tea. Great natural flavors and can be enjoyed all year long.<br />Tasty and soothing when served hot and flavorful enough to hold up nicely when iced.<br />It is a favorite at our house.

review/summary: very distasteful
review/text: For my sense of smell, this tea doesn't smell like peach and ginger.  It smells like something else that is very unappealing and distasteful.<br /><br />Besides this tea, I recently tried several other Bentley teas -- mango, blueberry, raspberry, etc. -- and I have to report that I also disliked them.  The Bentley teas seem to have very different smells compared to other teas, like Twinings, Tazo, Ahmad, etc.<br /><br />Although I've tried many teas that didn't impress me, the Bentley teas are the first that I have found that I completely dislike.  Given the mixture of very positive and very negative reviews for their teas, I'm guessing that it is a situation where people have strong reactions to the smell of their teas and either love them or hate them.<br /><br />For a comparison, I would recommend trying the Ahmad Peach & Passion Fruit tea, which I think is very tasty -- and very, very different compared to this Bentley tea.

review/summary: Watch your cupper !
review/text: I didn't like this at all.  I found it chemical, and not nicely redolent of the ginger I O so, love.  I just gave it away, cute little tin and all.  I am adventurous, so I do happen on things I feel aren't what I expected from time to time.  This was certainly one of them.  I'm sure some of you will like like it, don't let me stop you from trying out your own personal tastebuds.  Mine said: "This tea is not a real peach, either."

review/summary: My Dog's Favorite Snack!
review/text: I was first introduced to this snack at my dog's training classes at petco. He really enjoys them! The pieces are really tiny but you can tell that it is made from quality ingredients (it also smells really bad), but my dog loves it. I highly recommend this product as it is a quality product that is actually healthy for your pup!

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: This soup is nice for a snack or light meal. The broth has a tasty, light tomato flavor and the ingredients taste fresh. The noodles don't have much flavor to me, but they are not bad.<br /><br />I like Muir Glen's Minestrone soup a little better.

review/summary: Horrible soup - the worst soup I've ever tasted. It literally tastes like vomit.
review/text: I bought a few cans of Imagine organic Minestrone soup today at Grocery outlet, brought them home and tried some for lunch.  I love minestrone soup so I expected to like it.<br /><br />It was horrible. It literally tasted like vomit, and I've been trying every since to get the taste out of my mouth.  I only ate two tablespoons of it before dumping the rest out.  Grocery Outlet sells "old" food, which is nearing it expiration date, but this batch doesn't expire for another four months. I'll be returning the rest of the ones I bought to the store, and can't imagine buying something from this company agai.<br /><br />Grocery Outlet has a large number of Imagine products on sale for $1 to $1.49 a can; I can't help but wonder if it's because something is wrong with them.

review/summary: ONE OF THE BEST MIXES OF ANY SORT WE HAVE EVER FOUND
review/text: Generally speaking, my wife and I are not overly fond of most "mixes."  We, over the years, have found them to be inferior to the stuff we turn out at home.  But that being said, we have also discovered that quite often we have neither the time nor the inclination to whip up a batch of stuff from scratch.<br /><br />It is also a fact, and not a general statement, that we both love cornbread as does the rest of our family.  We both were raised on the stuff...like as it was served with just about ever meal, day after day after day.<br /><br />You can imagine our delight when we found a mix that is not only quickly prepared, but one that actually tastes just about as good as anything either of us have ever whipped together...cornbread wise.<br /><br />All you need with the six ounce pack of this stuff is 2/3 cup of milk and one beaten egg.  You then take a 8 inch ovenproof skillet or square pan (we use a cast iron skillet...a very, very old one), and spray it with a no-sick cooking spray and stick the pan in a preheated oven (425 degrees) for 7 to 8 minutes.<br /><br />You then combine the cornbread mix, mild and egg in a small mixing bowl, stir until smooth and dump it in the skillet.  Bake at 425 degrees for 18 to 22 minutes until golden brown.<br /><br />That is it!<br /><br />This particular cornbread has a wonderful consistency and a very (I stress "very") mild pepper flavor as it dose have Jalapeno peppers added...one of my favorites of the pepper family.  To be honest, I have never tasted anything quite like it.  It easily reaches the category of comfort food.  I actually defy you to eat just one chunk and quite.  This is truly good stuff folks.<br /><br />There is a fancier way of fixing it by adding a small can of creamed corn and cheddar cheese, but we like the basic recipe so much we have never given it a try.<br /><br />The price here is a bit steeper than we pay at the local Wally store type place, but not much more.<br /><br />Trust me folks...give this stuff a try.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: This is a fantastic black tea!
review/text: I am so glad to see Peet's products offered for sale on Amazon!  You can't go wrong with any Peet's products.  The teas and coffees that their expert buyers search out are top quality and very often unique.  The product is always as fresh as fresh can be.<br /><br />This Pride of the Port blend is made from black tea.  This is not a strong breakfast blend.  It has a beautiful reddish brown color when brewed and it has a wonderful floral fragrance and a complex taste.  Brewed properly, one can taste many flavors.  It is very "nuanced" and provides a soothing and relaxing experience.  There is no bitterness, no off or odd flavors.  It's not my favorite of all Peet's teas, but it is my favorite of those offered here.<br /><br />If you want to get the most out of your tea experience, or if you're having trouble getting your water temperatures just right, check out the electric tea kettle we use:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DYERBK">Breville BKE820XL Variable-Temperature 1.8-Liter Kettle</a>.  We love it!  It gets your water to the correct temp quickly!  And it's very safe to use.

review/summary: Bad product
review/text: We purchased Lupini Beans on Amazon.  The company is Parthenon Foods.  When we received the item we opened the first jar, the beans were incredibly bitter, so we opened the 2nd jar, same thing.  We poured out the beans and some of them were black. Contacted Parthenon Foods and this was their response:<br /><br />Hello,  We are sorry, but we cannot honor a return or refund for this order.  The order was delivered as scheduled by the shipping service selected.  The product(s) shipped were as advertised.  Please read our shipping and returns policies for more information. "You cannot return items that you do not like in taste or package shape"<br /><br />How convenient for them!!  The beans are bitter and bad.  I will NEVER order from this company again and I hope that all that read this review be careful in ordering any product from them.  I order many food items online and have never had a problem.  It is not that we didn't like the taste, the beans are bad, I grew up on Lupini Beans and have ordered other brands online and not had a problem.  So to Parthenon Foods, guess that was an easy $20.00 for you!!  So to the buyer beware, it may look good online, but you're taking a huge risk on when the product arrives!!

review/summary: best tasting whole wheat bread
review/text: Since my wife put me on a diet and made me eat only whole wheat bread, I was searching for good tasting whole wheat bread. Finally I found Sterns whole wheat bread which is healthy and good tasting (probably the best whole wheat bread I  ever had). Since then I always eat whole wheat bread even though I am long off my diet.
