review/summary: Pure Himalayan Salt -  the healthy salt
review/text: I have been easily able to substitute Himalayan Salt with regular table salt for cooking, baking and flavoring my food at the table. I was on a special diet for esophagitis and starting using Himalayan Salt for its healing benefits. And because I was avoiding spicy food, it was the one "condiment" I could enjoy.

review/summary: Good Tasting Soup From A Box.
review/text: This noon for lunch I had a box of Dr. McDougall's Garden Vegetable Soup (lower sodium variety. It was quite good. The box contained two servings and only 60 calories each.I consumed both servings. Plus, it had no fat and, of course, the sodium was low. It was a good tasting soup and, together with a couple other items, made a good nutritious lunch.<br /><br />I like to find items like this because I can store  them in my pantry and have a good meal prepared in no time at all. Plus, I worry about proper nutrition and so many of the things you can store are so high in salt, sugar and fat. Not here! This is a good item. I've also enjoyed their lentil soup and I'll probably test a few other kinds. You wouldn't think such good soups would come in a box.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: FINALLY, A Great Option For Those With Artificial Dye Intolerances and Allergies!
review/text: I bought Better Bowls Vanilla Instant Pudding after hunting high and low for pudding mixes that weren't laden with artificial ingredients. My local stores don't carry such things. I live in a rural community and am approximately 70 miles one way from the nearest natural and organic supermarket. Online shopping makes more sense for my family. Wanting to make a recipe that I had not made in years which called for pudding mix I hopped onto Amazon one afternoon, did a search for "natural pudding mix" and behold! Better Bowls came up in the search results!<br /><br />I had not tried this product previously---I usually opt for buying one box of something before committing to a case lot purchase---but I had high hopes that this pudding would meet my family's needs. I have a child who has a red dye intolerance (both red #40 and cochineal/carmine extracts send her skin into fits of eczema). Unfortunately this means that the most famous national branded pudding mixes do not work for us. Like so many other boxed mixes out there today, many puddings use red #40 added as a colorant, which my child cannot have.<br />We were so excited to see that Better Bowls Vanilla Instant Pudding is free from those colorants!<br /><br />I was also pleased to see that the seller, Better Bowls,  was participating with Amazon on the Prime shipping offering...so I clicked, it shipped immediately and I had my pudding mix in two days.<br /><br />This pudding didn't just meet my expectations, but it exceeded them!  Not only did I make up a batch for snacking on after school, but I also used Better Bowls in the recipe that called for boxed pudding mix. I am happy to report that it performed exactly as the small box of national brand pudding normally does for me! I also love the fact that I can make a dish of rich creamy pudding for my family and not have to worry about what I am feeding them. The fact that there's fiber in there too is a plus...not that you can tell by the taste! My kids have no clue about the healthy ingredients in there---they just know that it tastes good.<br />I was so pleased with this purchase that we bought the Better Bowls Instant Pudding and Pie Filling, Chocolate, Heart Healthy, Gluten-free, Good Source of Fiber, Protein and Calcium, Low Fat, Low Sodium, Natural Colors and Flavors, (4.1oz Pouches) Pack of 7 as well. We'll be back for more of both when we run out!

review/text: I am so happy we decided to try this pudding. The thing that really got my attention was lower sodium and fiber! Fiber in pudding, how great is that... I was a little worried that it might have an odd texture because of the fiber but it does not, and the taste is good too...<br /><br />Another great bonus... 0 Trans Fats.<br /><br />Also nice that it come in a resealable pouch which allows you to easily make one serving at a time if you like.<br /><br />And you really can make it with just a spoon...no need to haul out the blender for a bowl of pudding. Two minutes stirring a few more minutes of setting time and you have pudding.<br /><br />We are hoping there will be even more flavors available to try in the future but for now we are happy with this one!

review/summary: Best Pudding!
review/text: I normally do not eat prepackaged pudding, since it is full of chemicals, but was trying to find something to mix with canned pumpkin and found a recipe for vanilla pumpkin pudding.  I never buy the typical store pudding, and fortunately, I found the Better Bowls brand on Amazon.  I was so excited to try and was not disappointed when I did.  This pudding is fantastic!<br /><br />When you mix it with milk the sugar content increases, so I tried to make it with almond milk, but the almond milk makes the consistantcy soupy.  They also sell sugar free made with nutrasweet which I refuse to eat, so I hope that they will make a Stevia version some day.  Do not hesitate to try!  The chocolate flavor tastes awesome too!

review/text: As far as natural dog treats go, these trotter bones have a lot of meat on them.<br /><br />There's a disparity in how much meat is left on each bone though, which is why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5.  When you buy these in a store you can select the ones with the most meat, but online vendors just pick these treats from a bin, making you feel a bit "short-changed" by the non-meaty ones!<br /><br />One great thing about the Jones Company is that it shrink-wraps its products, thus making them hygienic and easy to store.  The shrink-wrap reduces their smell too!<br /><br />My dog loves these and they keep him busy for hours.

They are so much safer than many other long lasting chews but they don't fall apart immediately like many of the other safe chews. They are compatible with their kong toys but just as good alone. I love giving these to my pups when I need a breather, some time alone or if I had to leave them in their crate when they were younger. Totally awesome. To this day, people (groomer, vet, tester, etc) comment about how white and healthy their teeth are.

review/summary: I Love Kukicha!
review/text: Kukicha, and Eden Kukicha in particular, is an old and trusted friend of mine.  When prepared well (and there may be many alternatives to skillfully preparing this brew) it has a mildly rich and mellow flavor that is very settling to both mind and body.  A great follow-up to sushi with pickled ginger (an Eden-style treat to be sure) or (perhaps a more distant match but equally well suited) to good chocolate, it is my favorite beverage for many and most occasions.<br /><br />To maximize that rcih and mellow flavor, prepare several cups at a time by boiling water (for optimal results, use a pyrex or other non-metallic pot) and steeping one teabag per cup.  When I am thinking ahead and have the time, I make a quart in a saucepan in the evening, keeping the water just below boiling for a few minutes after the four teabags have been added for the tea to really brew.  Then allowing it to stand overnight, it mellows and loses that tannic edge.  In the morning, I re-heat and put in a thermos to enjoy through the day.  You may find with this method that you can use only two or three teabags per quart of water to get the flavor you like.<br /><br />Or, for more immediate resutls on a cup-by-cup basis, pre-heat your cup with some hot water, then discard the water and fill with just-boiled water, add a teabag, and allow to steep until it has cooled to drinking temperature, at which time the teabag can be removed.<br /><br />Kukicha has health benefits, too.  For one, it can help to neutralize the stomach.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this good tea as much as I do!  I give Eden five stars for consistently having that rich and mellow quality that I like so much in this tea, and also for the good wrapping it puts its teabags in, which  I think must help preserve freshness and flavor.

review/text: I've been drinking Eden bagged teas since I saw them in a health food store in the 1990s.<br /><br />While the sencha and genmaicha are good (there are many brands of sencha out there, and I'm spoiled by the loose genmaicha from Tealuxe), in my opinion the Eden kukicha is outstanding. It's so good that I'm reluctant to try another bagged brand; however, I do look forward someday to trying the Eden loose kukicha tea.<br /><br />This Eden kukicha has the same very complex, earthy aroma and flavor that it had in the 1990s. I'm pleased that Eden has maintained high standards for this tea.<br /><br />Eden kukicha is almost impossible to ruin: I let water come to a good boil and steep the bag for at least 4-5 minutes.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Not my cup of tea
review/text: This tea has a strong and deep earthy taste. I'm not a big fan of the taste, I bought it once and won't buy it again. If you've ever had oolong tea before, know that it tastes very much like oolong. Personal preferences on taste aside, the tea is just fine. The quality is good and the bags are individually wrapped.

review/summary: Cure for sore throats
review/text: For about 5 years, especially during the winter months, I used to come down with several very painful sore throats, many of which would escalate into strep throat or a sinus infection.  I haven't had one since I started drinking Kukicha tea 2 years ago.  It's isn't carried in many stores so I'm glad I can get it through Amazon now and that it's eligible for free shipping.<br /><br />I'm not a doctor and this isn't medical advice, but if you are having a problem with sore throats this is worth a shot.

review/summary: Excellent Tea
review/text: Kukicha is NOT and never has been green tea!  It is the stems and twigs of the tea plant picked when the caffeine is lowest and the calcium is highest in the plant.  It is a rich brown color with a woody slightly astringent flavor.  I find nothing more soothing than a cup of this kukicha tea and carry the tea bags everywhere I go.  I also use it if I begin to get a sty on my eye.  I brew a strong cup, soak a washcloth in it and apply it warm to my eye.  The sty is usually gone in a few hours.

review/summary: Great value Good taste.  Small package
review/text: I noticed this when I look everyday to see if Amazon has the I'm Healthy brand back in stock.  My son is allergic to peanuts so we eat a lot of soynut butter.  This brand is Canadian, I had never heard of it obviously being in the states.  I researched their website and contacted the company that manufactures it directly before purchasing this item from Amazon.  I had wanted to buy samples to try before taking the plunge on 200 containers of soynut butter.  They do not have samples available.  My daughters new preschool makes the parents responsible for bringing snack to the class every month.  So, I bought these to pair with sliced apples on my snack day.<br />This is the perfect pre-measured size to prevent over eating of the soy butter.  Great serving size for travel and little people who usually waste most of what is put on a plate anyway.  This is very smooth.  It is not as sweet as the I'm Healthy brand by far.  It has more of a peanut butter feel to it as well, I would guess because of less sugar perhaps.  But nothing like the unsweetened kinds you can get, which I do not like at all!  I enjoyed eating it and my son did as well.  When ever we get through all 200 of these, I will definately purchase again.

review/summary: Great Cajun and here is an interesting twist!
review/text: I love trying different turkey (meat) balls made with fat free ground turkey. I created my own recipes for Scandinavian and Italian. No one believes they are eating turkey and they love them! Costco sells a four pack by a well known brand name, 98% fat free. I am not sure of the exact weight of two packages but it is approximately three pounds. I used two boxes of this wonderful coating (mixed in with everything else) two eggs, some water and some cooked brown rice for a healthy filler. I always leave the meat very moist so the end result is not dry. I made two test turkey balls, fried with no fat using a non stick frying pan. I turned the meat balls so all sides were lightly browned and very crispy. The taste was extremely pleasant, mildly spicy. I like very spicy so I added some ground red pepper and garlic powder because I did not have hot Cajun pepper. I just ordered some as well as more of the Luzianne chicken coating.<br /><br />The result was wonderful and I froze a substantial amount of the Luzianne turkey meatballs. I am extremely pleased and so is my family. I believe you will like this mix regardless of how you choose to use it!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H25SQW">Luzianne Chicken Coating Mix, 8 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Perfectly Balanced Confection - Now Changed
review/text: Better than the original, if that's possible. The crispy shell is coated in delicate, dark crumbles. The impossibly silky truffle center hides a pearl of dark chocolate that melts sensuously on your tongue. All together, this candy has the perfect balance of textures, sweetness, and richness. It's just a mouthful, yet it's rich enough to satisfy. It's not too dark, but it will tempt even milk chocolate lovers to the dark side. It's not too sweet, like many chocolates are these days. Ferrero has made wonderful candy for years, and this delightful, nut-free, dark version of their famous favorite is absolute perfection.<br /><br />Update: Ferrero has overhauled the recipe on these chocolates. The crispy wafer shell is thicker, the creme center is not as deep and rich, and they no longer contain a chocolate pearl, but rather an almond chip. Still pretty good, but absolutely nowhere near as heavenly as the original. Changing my rating to a four, and that's a very generous four.

review/summary: Transcendental - you gotta try it.
review/text: I'm a bit of spice hound and have flirted with other hot sauces before, but nothing has ever seized hold of me like Sriracha. An old Greenwich Village burger joint near where I worked at NYU used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer. The memory haunted me for years before I finally picked up a bottle. I shouldn't have waited. This stuff is amazingly addictive with a garlicky sweet hot yumminess that's hard to describe. It sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and I've drained a bottle in a 3 month period. Incredible on eggs, superb on burritos, utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegetable dishes from the Chinese restaurant. I put a squirt in the health low-sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up. Utterly highest recommendation.

review/summary: Should be in Every Kitchen - better than Tabasco but to be candid there is NOT a stunning difference between the two
review/text: A potent hot sauce with interesting flavor notes. Not quite as hot as Tabasco (yet very close), on a drop by drop basis. Nevertheless it is quite hot even when used in very small quantities. This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks, etc.<br /><br />While Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a vinegar note - this product has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat (such as sugar and garlic), yet the heat is considerable and it is this heat which dominates.<br /><br />I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year. As I said: this stuff is potent.<br /><br />I wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato is simply the sun ripened chilies and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary taste<br /><br />I like this product and I'd definitely recommend its purchase but I'm not sure it rates 5 stars! The overall flavor does not strike me as exceptional or in any way perfectly balanced. There really is just one major taste - heat - and then a vague hint of something else which seems to be sugar and garlic. But to be perfectly clear - it is FAR better than Tabasco and the difference is NOT subtle. I prefer the garlic and sugar of this product to Tabasco's vinegar notes. Yet keep in mind this is nothing more than a hot sauce and it will NOT magically transform any dish.<br /><br />For the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- I'm glad to have it on hand.<br /><br />Given the potency - I would NOT buy this product in bulk. One bottle will last many months<br /><br />Update (July 2010) - a formal taste test<br /><br />I put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too "hot" to taste<br /><br />Results: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh but sweeter note

We have been die hard fans of Tabasco Chipotle sauce, but not the price.<br /><br />We had seen Emeril and Bobby Flay using the Sriracha sauce on their shows, so we knew it had to be good, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />As the previous reviewer said, it is spicy, sweet and a great garlic flavor.<br /><br />We use it for lots of things.  One of our favorites is to make ranch dip and kick it up a few notches with Sriracha sauce.<br /><br />It IS hot, so start out with just a little bit, until you have adjusted your tastebuds.<br /><br />I like stuff spicier than my husband and father, and one of our daughters hates anything hot at all, whereas the other is like me and could drink Texas Pete straight from the bottle.  Sriracha can be added to each person's taste.<br /><br />I've even tried it on ice cream!  (NO, I am not pregnant!  I just like the  flavor it adds.

review/text: I am a huge fan of Larabars.  Tropical Fruit Tart must be a new flavor.  I just found it in the store, and it is awesome.  It has flavors of pineapple, coconut, and orange.  How awesome is that?  I love tropical fruity flavors.<br /><br />In addition to tasting awesome, Larabars are healthy, soy-free, vegan, kosher.  Even if you are not a vegan, or don't care about healthy bars, these bars still taste good.  Most things that are healthy, I've discovered, do not taste good.  Larabars, however, are the exception.  Larabars taste really good.  I love all the flavors.  But this particular review is for Tropical Fruit Tart.  If you like tropical fruit, you will love this bar.<br /><br />Larabars are "naturally" sweet; they have no added sugar, but they could have fooled me!  They come in a wide variety of flavors, and it really amazes me how they can make these bars without added sugar, but they taste sweet.  They satisfy my craving for sweets or a candy bar, but yet they are healthy!!!  How awesome!!!<br /><br />Even though this has nothing to do with the awesome taste and healthiness of the bars, but I think it is also awesome that these bars were created and made in Colorado.  The company is in Denver.  Healthy, good-tasting bars from the magnificent, beautiful Rocky Mountains!!!

review/summary: Just what I wanted
review/text: My local Safeway only orders this product during the Thanksgiving/Christmas season. Once their stock runs out, its gone till next season. I got hooked on putting walnuts on my salads because my doctor said to eat healthier and sent me to a nutritionalist for a class on proper eating. I ordered these on Amazon and the total price w/membership in Prime shipping is less than what I paid at Safeway for the same amount. They're fresh and taste great.

review/summary: subscribe and save cat food
review/text: I love this program with Amazon.  I have many subscriptions for catfood.  The only problem I have with it, is the prices are changing CONSTANTLY/daily.  Seriously, I have to monitor my account almost every day.  The prices jump around from $9/case to $17/case ALL THE TIME.  I did not understand that part when I signed up for subscribe and save.  In the beginning, I ended up paying $17/case a few times (becuz I was not watching to see what the price was on my shipment day).  I can get it at WalMart for $10-$11/case.  I figured, subscribing meant locking in the price, and that is not the case with this program.  Now I watch them alot and I am just cancelling and re-activating everything all the time.  I will only do this if it is cheaper for me than I pay at WalMart.  I have lots of cats and I also feed strays, so I need to save money on catfood whenever possible.

review/summary: My cat sings Frikies' praises!
review/text: When my cat adopted me at a local shelter, I had no clue what kind of food is good for a kitten. All my dogs are on grain-free dry food. So naturally I started him on dry food. Later on, I tried different wet food but he refused them.<br /><br />My cat is not an eager eater. He gets unlimited supply of dried food throughout the day, and he always finishes fixed amount which is in line with vet's recommendation. He also snacks on Pounce throughout the day, but mostly he prefers just to play. Play with his hyperactive adopted doggie siblings, his adopted human, or any newly discovered toys. He plays non-stop about 80% of his awake time. Food comes second in priority. That was all true, until he met the Friskies canned cat food months later.<br /><br />The first time my cat tried the Friskies savory shreds whitefish and tuna in sauce, he hestiated just like when he first encountered cheese, yogurt, or small chunks of steak. But unlike steaks or cheese which he simply left untouched nowadays, he took one lick of the Friskies shreded seafood and he gulbbed down whatever he could fit into his tiny tummy. Since then, he's fed a mix of dry and wet food. He still gets unlimited dried food through the day and only one meal of wet food at night (mixed with dry food). He's usually not very vocal and hardly talk. But when he sees his wet food coming in the special bowl, he would follow the bowl and sing all the way to his dinning area.<br /><br />Like all pet owners, I hope my cat would always eat a healthy and balanced diet. I also wish he would prefer some food that would smell more pleasing to human sense than his current favorite, this Friskies. But being such a good, well behaved, and healthy pet, I think he deserves something he likes so much. My cat has been on a mix of dry and wet food for a few months now. He's long and lean like a 10 pound tiger. And the vet is giving him a clean bill of health. One day he may grow tired of this, or gain enough weight for us to be alarmed. But as long as he stays healthy and fit and sings the Friskies' praises, this will remain his nighttime snack!

review/summary: Something's different...
review/text: The Salmon Shreds are our cat's favorite (he's a picky 17 year old veteran).  Our local Walmart doesn't have this flavor so I usually get it at the expensive grocery store around the corner.  I was thrilled to find it cheaper on Amazon.  However, even though it's the same brand, same flavor, and not expired, he will hardly pick at the food from the ordered cans.  Thinking that perhaps he got tired of the Salmon Shreds I just bought a can around the corner for comparison, and he's really chowing down.  So perhaps the flavor of the ordered cans changed because they underwent some drastic temperature change, or maybe it's a different batch - don't have a clue.  Just wish I hadn't ordered 2 cases at once.

review/summary: My cats like the Shreds varieties
review/text: We have a few cats, so finding flavors they agree on was hard at first.  In this shreds or shredded type, almost all the flavors have met with their approval.<br /><br />We try to feed a variety of flavors in various cat foods to keep things interesting, but every morning we offer one can of shreds because it's always eaten by someone who preferred it to another offering. Of all the flavors, the two that have become the staples in our house are the chicken/salmon and the whitefish/tuna.  The others are just fine too, but these are the favorites.<br /><br />Even our one cat who prefers dry foods likes these, and really digs lapping up the gravy.<br /><br />This is available at our supermarket for about 45 cents a can, and we'd love to see it on Subscribe and Save at a more competative price than the current almost 80 cents a can offered.  If the S&S price were closer, we'd sign up for it.

review/summary: Not sure how old these are, but at 19.18 a case they are 70 cents a can
review/text: I ordered these to see if it might save me the trouble of buying at the store.  My cats only eat the chicken savory shreds, so when I saw they had this, I ordered it without realizing how much per can I was actually paying.  I pay no more than 50 cents per can at the local grocery store (sometimes they are on sale and much lower) so here I overpaid by a long shot.  I paid 19.18, which comes out to 70 cents per can. So then, I go to feed my cats some of this food, their absolute favorite, and they take a bite and walk away.  The only explanation I can possibly come up with for this is that this batch of canned cat food is not fresh. When I get it from the local store, they eat it all and want more.<br />So there has got to be something different about these cans and I suspect that they have been sitting in a warehouse way too long.  I won't order them online again.

review/text: When my rescued stray, Goldie, unexpectedly presented me with four kittens a few years ago, mealtime soon went from "Meow" to "Yuck."  All the little cats had different taste buds it seems.  The household went through several brands of canned cat food flavors with some untouched plates, some barely there plates, and a couple of clean plates.  The day the cats were introduced to Frskies Savory Shreds with Salmon was a day to celebrate.  All the cats love it!  The only reason it didn't get five stars is because I have sloshed salmon sauce on myself and the floor several times.  It could be a bit thicker maybe.

review/text: There isn't much gusto involved at dinner when the 5 guys get this. But then, fish is not their fav.<br />Friskies Tuna/chicken with gravy IS their fav, but obviously pure fish (even in sauce) is only "OK."<br />They eat it, albeit slowly...but they do eat it, cleaning down to the bowl.<br /><br />I buy it for variety, along with turkey in gravy and chicken in gravy. Beef? Nope. Beef is another no no in my house. They won't eat beef, even if I give it from my own hamburger...go figure. Cats!<br /><br />And if you thought that I put them into this groove, you'd be wrong. I tried umpteen different brands, flavors, textures, even organic and raw. But over the period of a year, we're down to about 4 or 5 different selections of gravy-laden food, and that's it. 3 are kittens; 1 is 5 yrs old; 1 old gal on a diet for obesity (not much anymore), however, will eat almost, that is almost everything I give her.<br /><br />The kids' main diet is Natural Balance Reduced Calorie, dry. It is on self-feed and they all like it...amazing.<br />They get only 1 can of wet food divided by 5, once or twice a day.

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are ground yellow corn, corn gluten meal, and chicken by-product meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a cheap corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs." Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Friskies at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, dry foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/summary: Trial package of Shirataki
review/text: If you are not sure if you will like Shirataki this is a nice trial size package but at a premium price. Here on Amazon the multi-packs are running around three each instead of the six I am paying. If a grocery store near you has these in rice or noodle form they can be as low as two dollars. This should make two or three servings depending on the recipe.<br /><br />First, these and all current Shirataki products are packed in water. I am not sure why but that is just necessary. Shirataki noodles like these are made from the flour of a type of yam. Other companies use Shirataki and tofu flour to make noodles with a more starchy texture instead of the slippery feel of pure Shirataki. The stagnant water or fish odor when you open packages is just something you have to deal with.<br /><br />Second, rice is a severe misnomer, they are more like pearl tapioca balls or a slippery orzo pasta.<br /><br />To use: bring broth with seasonings for soup to a boil. In the sink open the package and pour the stagnant smelling water out of the package and rinse the product for half a minute or more to remove most of the odor. A wire strainer is useful here.  Add the rinsed contents of the package to the broth or water and boil for one minute. Shirataki absorbs the taste of what they are cooked in and boiling is best. The orzo-like "rice" should not be boiled longer than a minute or so.  After you have boiled these in a chicken or beef broth with added vegetables and seasoning and anything else you enjoy in a soup serve and you have an extremely low calorie, low carb, filling meal.<br /><br />There is a low carb Shirataki fried rice recipe with egg and bacon that sounds good, Google it, but I haven't tried that yet. I do think boiling Shirataki for a minute in broth improves the flavor enough to do that for any recipe you are considering. Some people just boil Shirataki in water and then add the Shirataki to whatever dish and cook that for a couple minutes for the Shirataki to absorb the flavors.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about Shirataki. The texture and preparation take getting used to and it may be easier to just make some spaghetti squash and have those noodles available in the refrigerator to use as an alternative. However, Shirataki noodles or "rice" are much lower in carbs and calories (zero!) than the low carb wheat and other grain pastas that are becoming much more common.

review/summary: Ok, not quite the miracle hoped for
review/text: My spouse and I both eat low carb, and he loves rice, so these looked like they had the potential of becoming a regular part of our lives.<br /><br />These are a product from a sea plant, so when you open the package of "rice" in water, you will smell something literally "fishy".  I shouldn't have let him see this part of the operation because once he smelled it, it was like he couldn't get the fish thing out of his mind... and he's a vegetarian.<br /><br />You do have to rinse these a lot in a strainer, and they even smell a tiny bit while boiling for the requisite minute or two but it disappeared.  When done boiling, you lay them out on a paper towel to dry a bit.<br /><br />This "rice" probably works better if used in something, or if boiled in something like broth to pick up flavor.  We tend to eat rice as a bottom for something on top, and naked, this rice probably isn't at its best.<br /><br />The texture is not like rice- these are slippery and smooth, more like tapioca.  The fact there's little bits is what makes kind of like rice.  We put some vegetable curry on top and dug in.<br /><br />The fish taste was completely gone, but as you would guess, it is not as satisfying as regular rice.  On the other hand, if you are used to having to change your expectations because you have done subtituting for carb-laden foods before, you may be fine with this "rice".  I was, and I have been eating low carb for years.  Hubby has not low carbed as long and did not find them wonderful, and told me I need not buy this again... though shopping just for myself, I would.<br /><br />I guess we're back to Dreamfield's pasta products.  Wish they made a rice or orzo style product!

review/text: Smelly, nasty, gummy pellets. Used as a rice substitute and threw the resulting mess away after failing  to gag it down.

review/summary: delicious chocolate chip cookies!
review/text: I got the "chocolate chip cookies" flavor and they were so good! They really taste like the real deal - just like the typical normal chocolate chip cookies (except much healthier!).

review/summary: Pricing???
review/text: Hey Kegworks, you do know that for just seven dollars more you can buy a THREE pack of the same size bottles just about anywhere, including this website!  Just how much are you marking this stuff up anyway?? Twenty one dollars for one 16 oz bottle???  Normal price is about $9.00!

review/summary: Absolutely the best Bloody Mary Mix.
review/text: Demitri's Mix is incredible. Just buy any generic tomato juice in the can, and add a bit of this mix, and you have an instant mix. This is extremely tasty, and I highly recommend it.<br />I buy it to make Michelada's (your favorite lager beer + bloody mary mix). Salt your glass, add salt on the rim, and ice cubes. Pour in the Mary Mix to fill half of your glass, add a dash of lime juice and Tabasco, and top off with your favorite Lager Beer. O M G. Yum-O.

review/summary: Best damn Bloody Mary ever!
review/text: I love this stuff! My parents turned me on to this a couple years ago. And in turn I have shared it with my In-laws. I just found out about the other flavors, I have yet to try them, but I will soon!  We also use it to marinade flank steaks and deer meat. It really is a great product.

review/text: The cashews where fresh and good. Only problem is that they where mostly pieces versus whole. I have been useing the pieces on icecream and salads.
