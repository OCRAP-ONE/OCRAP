review/summary: Singed Phoenix's Review: Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams
review/text: When I think I of graham crackers, I think of it as a dessert cracker. I usually have it with peanut butter or use it to make s'mores. So I don't really see the purpose of trying to make it healthy or all-natural when most likely it's going to be consumed with something that is fattening in the first place. Not to be a Debbie Downer here, but the health benefits are no better than the Honey Maid low-fat brand, actually, the Honey Maid brand has more calcium than the Back to Nature brand. Not only that, but the taste is "meh" at best. Question, why do they sell a cinnamon flavored variety, but yet have such a strong cinnamon flavor for this variety? I can't in good morals give this product a good rating, it's more niche than quality in my opinion.

review/summary: Nice honey flavor
review/text: When Amazon asked me to test this product I jumped at the chance.  I always loved Graham crackers even at a very young age.<br />"Back to Nature" is different, it is almost like what you might call grown up graham crackers.<br />The Golden Honey Oat flavor is pleasantly sweet with a distinctive honey flavor and it is dotted with oat flakes.<br />I did enjoy these and I will be buying them since I only get one box of each flavor.

review/summary: best whole-grain graham out there
review/text: My family has been whole-grain converts for a few years, and one thing that was always challenging to find was a whole grain graham cracker. I'm sort of addicted to them (they are simple and sweet and fairly good for noshing on during the day) but finding any that didn't have a ton of partially-hydrogenated oils  was close to impossible, and the ones I found in health food stores were pretty disgusting- VERY grainy and "chunky".<br /><br />These are really, really good. At first bite, I thought "I don't know about this..." because they don't pack the sweetness quite as much as the typical graham, but after my second bite, I was hooked. Perfectly sweet, perfect texture (yes, made with whole grains but without the weird "tooth" of other whole grain crackers), perfect size, not crumbly.<br /><br />My husband liked them, my five year old loved them, and I'm a convert.<br /><br />Very pleased and we'll be ordering more.

review/summary: Nothing great about these.
review/text: These taste okay, although for me, they lean a bit towards cardboardy.  I'm not sure if I would reorder.  The ingredients are:<br /><br />GRAHAM FLOUR (WHOLE GRAIN WHEAT FLOUR), WHOLE GRAIN ROLLED OATS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, SAFFLOWER OIL, HONEY, RAISIN PASTE, BROWN RICE SYRUP, LEAVENING (BAKING SODA, MONOCALCIUM PHOSPHATE), SEA SALT, CINNAMON, VITAMIN E TO HELP PROTECT FLAVOR. CONTAINS: WHEAT<br /><br />Oddly enough, they are not very sweet even though they have essentially four forms of sugar - evaporated cane juice, honey, raisin paste and brown rice syrup.  At least they don't contain any trans fats or hydrogenated oils.  Maybe I got stale box, but again, I'm just not sure I would reorder.

review/summary: Sharply Divided Opinions
review/text: We have a large family and opinions are sometimes sharply divided about food. Certain items that I request from the Vine program -- such as Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams -- are shared with family members who comprise a focus group (of sorts) and once again, the reactions to these grahams was divided almost equally, hence the rating. Some thought they were tasteless and gave them a poor rating; others liked them. However nutritional they may be, their appeal will be determined almost entirely by what people think of the taste. I added up all of the scores, divided the total by the number of raters, and arrived at Three Stars, my own rating. Try them and judge for yourself.

Aside from just snacking or having some with your tea, they are great for making graham cracker pie crust.  (Especially good for butterscotch or lemon pies!) Children will eat them like cookies!  So do I.<br /><br />Recommend highly.

review/summary: Nice flavor, a little dry ...
review/text: I liked these -- they're not too sweet, and you get lots of the graham flavor.  They're a bit on the dry side, probably because they're very low fat, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I'm not a huge graham cracker fan anyway, but these were quite nice.  I usually eat them with Nutella spread -- and these provide a great foundation for that particular treat.  They're a bit on the pricey side compared to other brands, but the extra health benefits and "nuttier" taste might be worth the extra expense to you.

review/summary: It's a graham cracker
review/text: I was a bit worried when I saw these were delivered in a padded envelope and sure enough all three packs inside were smashed very badly. I managed to rescue some larger pieces and take a few bites - VERY sweet. So then I tried them with one of my favorite toppings, unsalted crunchy peanut butter - a bit better. I had hopes when I ordered these that they would be less sweet than most graham crackers but if you find the Nabisco ones too sweet, you will also think these are. Also these seem a bit drier than Honey Maid - adding to it crumbiness? Not sure how a whole one would crumble when eating it since I don't have a whole one in all three packs.<br /><br />I am not marking these down to 3 stars because of the poor packaging. I was just hoping for a better (less sweet/better consistency) cracker than Honey Maid and these are not it.<br /><br />Perhaps the birds will enjoy these tomorrow.

review/text: These are a more wholesome substitute for your regular graham crackers.  I would have rated them a five if they had been the same size as their less healthy cousins but they are slightly smaller and therefore not as easy to use for smores.  However, they are very tasty, crisp and not overly sweet.  They have a more organic appeal than the standard store brands.  I will buy them again and will also try the other flavors.

review/summary: We live off graham crackers, and these are good.
review/text: Our family goes through a ton of graham crackers.  We always buy big packs, and are partial to our name brand (H. Maid), so I was eager to try another brand.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Smell: these smell great.  Fresh cracker w/ honey aroma.<br />- Texture: these are a little firmer and crunchier than our usual name brand.<br />- Flavor: good overall flavor.  Wheat and honey nicely balanced.  Similar if not slightly less sweetness than other brand.<br />- Nutrition: better.  Similar amount of sugar (7g per 28 g serving), but more fiber (2g versus 1 for name brand).<br />- Ingredients: maybe slightly less processed than name brand.  I personally consider evaporated cane juice to be 99.99% the same as "sugar".<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- The box is a little small for our family of graham cracker fanatics.  10 ounces can go pretty quick here.<br /><br />Overall a very tasty graham cracker. The great flavor and extra bit of fiber make it a win in our book.

review/summary: decent, but SUPER MESSY
review/text: These are actually classic, large graham cracker size (also packed in the traditional two plastic sleeves), so they're not small snack crackers.<br /><br />They taste pretty good and aren't overly sweet. The ingredient list is clearly all natural which is very nice. I do notice a slight...metallic? taste after eating them, but it's nothing terrible. They're maybe a little dry.<br /><br />The biggest drawback? Man are these things messy!! Graham crackers are not generally know for their non-crumminess, but these are crazy messy. I wouldn't give them to a kid when I was out anywhere as a snack, because little oat pieces and cracker dust will be everywhere! I just opened the package and ate 3 of them at my desk and there was so much dust I couldn't even just brush it onto the floor, I had to pile it up and toss it in the trash (well ok, I fed it to the dog, but you get the point).<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />serving size of 8 crackers (which is 2 full cracker sheets - so really serving size of 2)<br />10 servings per container<br />110 calories<br />2.5g fat<br />0g sat, trans, polyunsat, monounsat fat<br />0mg cholesterol<br />130mg sodium<br />21g carbs<br />2g dietary fiber<br />7g sugars<br />2g protien<br />no notable vitamins/minerals other than 4% d/v iron

review/text: These crackers are delicious - not overly sweet, but just the right amount of sweetness.  They are not dusted with sugar or anything, the way I remember the old graham crackers being.  They look exactly like the crackers on the box with a sprinkling of oats on the top.  I would imagine these would be delicious made into crumbs for a pie crust because the taste would be a lot more subtle than what we are used to with a graham cracker crust.  I could definitely see these being used for a cheesecake.

review/summary: Excellent traditional-tasting graham cracker
review/text: These are excellent graham crackers.  I love the crunchy crispy texture (not hard like another natural brand I once tried).  There is a grahamy/oaty flavor with a very subtle cinnamon hint afterwards. They are sweet but not too sweet.  Most of the graham crackers on the market contain high fructose corn syrup, so it is nice to have this product as an option that contains only natural sweeteners (Midel is another natural brand but sometimes hard to find).  These crackers are also healthier in that they do not contain partially hydrogenated oils, with safflower oil listed as the oil ingredient (2.5 g fat per 2 full cracker sheet serving).  Decent source of fiber (2 g) and fairly high sugar (7 g) per serving.<br /><br />I have tried making homemade graham crackers but could not get a proper texture, so I am sticking to store-bought for now.  Aside from a delicious snack, I also think this product would make a great graham cracker crust for cheesecake (I will try if I do not eat the whole box first!).  The only negative is that they are slightly expensive and come in a fairly small 10 oz box.<br /><br />I have also tried the Apple Cinnamon variety and I slightly prefer the Apple Cinnamon for snacking since it is more flavorful (4 stars for Golden Honey and 4.5 stars for Apple Cinnamon).

review/summary: Slightly less flavorful than Honey Maid, but probably better for you...
review/text: When wracking one's brain over which graham crackers to buy there are a few questions that have to be asked.  How much do they cost, how do they taste, what's in 'em, and does it matter whether or not the packaging is made with 100 percent recycled paperboard and printed with inks derived from renewable resources like soy, flax, and tree nuts.  For the purposes of this review I'm going to compare these Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Graham Crackers to Nabisco's Honey Maid Graham Crackers.<br /><br />My first impression of the Back to Nature grahams is that they're pretty good.  They have a nice crunch and you can taste the graham, oats and honey distinctively, which was nice.  They come in a 10 ounce box and contain three packets of crackers with each packet containing 7 crackers.  So lets get to the comparison...<br /><br />Cost.  A 10oz. package of the Back to Nature Grahams costs about three dollars and fifty cents (based on the 6-pack Amazon price), while a 14.4 oz box of Nabisco Honey Maid Grahams costs three dollars (checked my local supermarket this morning.)  So the Back to Nature crackers are about 40 percent more expensive for what they offer.<br /><br />Taste.  While I wouldn't call myself a cracker aficionado, I would say that both taste pretty darn good, though the flavor of the Back to Nature crackers are a bit more subtle on the honey and sweetness.  The Honey Maid crackers are more bold, not cloyingly so, but a bit tastier.<br /><br />Ingredients.  This is potentially the sticking point between the two and it all comes down to how you feel about partially hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrup.  Honey Maid's got 'em, and Back to Nature doesn't.  They have pretty much the same nutritional facts with Honey Maid coming in 0.5g higher in overall fat, 1g higher in sugar, and 40mg higher in sodium per serving.  Back to Nature has double the dietary fiber and triple the monounsaturated fat (though the Honey Maid website does mention that even though the box states 0g of trans fats, a serving of crackers can contain up to 0.5g of trans fats.)  Both brand use whole grain wheat flour, though Honey Maid uses as much if not more unbleached enriched flour.  So all in all Back to Nature is a tad more healthy.<br /><br />Sustainability.  Alright, Back to Nature wins this battle hands down with packaging made from 100% recycled paperboard and printed with inks derived from renewable resources like soy, flax, and tree nuts.<br /><br />All in al1, Back to Nature Graham Crackers are a more expensive than your standard crackers, but the cost is going toward sustainability and general quality, though honestly the taste is a bit lacking.

review/summary: Yum! NOT Wheat free though!
review/text: I don't buy regular graham crackers, because they are SO full of sugar, high fructose corn syrup, etc.<br /><br />These graham crackers are sweetened with evaporated cane juice, raisin paste & honey, not processed sugar, and  their taste is like a traditional graham cracker I remember from the late 60'/early 70's... before the high fructose corn syrup invasion. They taste oaty, a little nutty, and have a hint of cinnamon & honey. A lot like oatmeal cookies & with similar ingredients.<br /><br />These are probably healthier, and more flavored with oat, which tastes better to me than traditional wheat, yet these are NOT wheat free, so if you have a family member on a gluten-free or wheat-free diet, these aren't for you!<br /><br />If allergies/sensitivities to wheat are not a problem, these are wonderful (& likely far healthier than regular graham crackers made with processed everything.)<br /><br />Ingredients are listed as: Graham flour (Whole grain wheat flour), whole grain rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, safflower oil, honey, raisin paste, brown rice syrup, leavening (baking sods, monocalcium phosphate) sea salt, cinnamon, vitamin E to help protect flavor.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts include 4% DV of Total fat (0 saturated), 0 cholesterol, 5% sodium, 2% Potassium, 7% total carbs & 8% total fiber, so is a great snack with fiber (lacking in most crackers, etc.)<br /><br />A little higher on sodium than I'd like to see, but better than most snack foods out there!<br /><br />NOT FOR THOSE WITH A SENSITIVITY OR ALLERGY TO WHEAT!<br /><br />Manufacturer uses minimum 55% post-consumer content, 100% recycled paperboard in their packaging.

review/summary: Munchy Goodness!  A Satisfying Treat!
review/text: I have to admit it was with some trepidation that I picked out these graham crackers to try: my last Back To Nature product, a type of strawberry cereal had not gone over very well.  I couldn't even make it through a bowl.<br /><br />So I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really liked these graham crackers.  They have a light cinnamon & honey taste, plenty of dietary fiber, oats, and whole grains. They also have no high fructose corn syrup and no hydrogenated oils.  I shared them with some friends, and they all liked them, too.<br /><br />The crackers are a little dry, and they are not perforated very well, so they break apart in funny shapes, but they are very good.  I suggest maybe a little natural peanut butter or some hummus to cut the dryness of the cracker.<br /><br />The bottom line: Loaded with munchy goodness!

review/summary: A More Nutritious Snack
review/text: Back to Nature Graham crackers are quite good. They are a less sweet then the standard, non-sugar coated, graham crackers you find in the grocery store. I would say that Back to Nature graham crackers are slightly sweet.  They have a slight cinnamon flavor. These crackers have a chewy-crunchy texture, as they have oats/grains in them. They are still smooth. Just as important as the flavor are the ingredients. The crackers are made with whole grains and all natural ingredients and have no high fructose corn syrup. No hydrogenated oils. Zero saturated fats. There are 2 grams of fiber per 28 grams of cracker (recommended intake of fiber is around a min. of 25 grams per day). This equates to 8% of your fiber intake if you eat 2 sheets. Not bad.<br /><br />Another nice touch is that the box is made of recycled paper. The company claims to support the Nature Conservancy-a major conservation organization.<br /><br />I would feel good about giving this snack to my children.<br /><br />I'm going to open up the second package and test them, too<br /><br />:-)<br /><br />Oh, and there were no broken crackers in the box I got unlike what another reviewer found.<br /><br />And who cares about perforations?!

review/summary: A healthier version of a graham cracker
review/text: These were a perfect find as they came at a time in which I was trying to cut out sugars and refined carbs.  Overall, I think this is a good product.  It tastes good, it looks like a typical graham cracker (so your kids will probably accept it) and the ingredients are natural (whole grain wheat flour, rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, safflower oil, honey, raisin paste, brown rice syrup, leavening, sea salt, cinnamon, vitamin E).<br /><br />The crackers have a nice texture, crunchy to start, then they melt in your mouth.  Both myself and my three-year-old enjoyed eating them.  The box is made from 100% recycled paperboard.<br /><br />The only thing I'm not thrilled about is that the amount of sugar (7 grams in 2 cracker sheets) is fairly high.  One can see among the ingredients that four sweeteners are used and the amount of sugar is over twice that contained in the same serving of Health Valley Oat Bran graham crackers (which I happened to have on hand).  The Back to Nature crackers are a bit tastier, and if you want whole grains and some fiber, and are not too concerned about sugar, these are a good bet.

review/summary: Made a great pie crust
review/text: These seem a little expensive but the price per ounce was a little less then the Honey Maid on the Amazon website. Crackers and cookies are not a staple in my house but I use Graham Crackers when I make a Cheese Cake for a special dinner or to bring as a gift. Other reviewers complained of broken crackers but mine were fine and the job of making crumbs fell to me. A few seconds in the Cuisinart did a fine job - the oats from the top of the crackers were not as fine as the body of the cracker but it seemed to make no difference in the end result.<br /><br />The cheese cake and crust were fabulous- the crust seemed a bit more substantial and held together beautifully. It was easy to work with the crumbs.<br /><br />This product calls itself NATURAL- which has no FDA guidelines or regulations as ORGANIC does - What exactly does natural mean? I'm glad to see the packaging is recycled.<br /><br />My daughter used a cracker to make a simple dessert of her own invention- she spread a little cream cheese and creme fraiche on a cracker and topped it with a few thin slices of fresh pear and a drizzle of Trader Joe's chocolate syrup - it was fabulous- if you like plain graham crackers these are fine but I'm not a graham cracker fan.

review/summary: Crunchy version of an old favorite
review/text: This box probably costs about double to triple of what you'd pay for a standard box of graham crackers.  For the extra money you get organic this and that, brown rice syrup (as opposed to corn syrup) and limited preservatives.  There are about 10 percent less calories as well.  I'm not a big fan or enemy of organic food.  I just care about taste.  In this case, what you end up with taste-wise is a less sweet version of what's typical in a graham cracker.  These are crunchier as well, containing oats as well as graham wheat flour.  These also taste grainier.  If you like those kinds of characteristics and don't mind paying the extra bucks, I'd go with with Back To Nature.  As for me, I'll stick with the standard non-organic version of graham cracker.

review/text: These are some very tasty and sweet crackers.  They are a bit hard, not overly processed like some of the big brand crackers you find in the grocery store.  They are very tasty and and make a great snack.  I have not had a chance to make smoores with them, but I suspect they will be great for that too.  They are well formed and don't crumble apart easily so they are very versatile.

review/summary: Healthy Enough...But Bland And Crumbly
review/text: Graham crackers are something that brings back good childhood memories to most of us.  I can remember eating them as a snack at bedtime and in front of the TV as a kid.  Back then I was a lot less fussy about what I ate, as was the manufacturers of most snacks like this.  Today we have to be, or at least should be a little more selective and savvy as to what we what we indulge in.  These Back to Nature crackers fit the bill quite nicely as to being healthier than your average graham cracker, and, pretty much come at a respectable price for something that is supposed to be good for us.  Unfortunately they also come with the same liability as a lot of things that are better for us.  They're just that much more tasteless than the old stand bye good for nothing, but delicious regular graham crackers to be sure.  They go all right with a chaser like a cup of coffee, or a nice cold glass of milk easy enough. But straight up they are very dry, and in my opinion quite a bit less flavorful than their nostalgic counterparts.  Also, for some reason I have never really understood, organic foods always seem to have a much different consistency, (usually unpleasant) than their lip smacking alter egos.  These Back to Nature crackers that crumble at the touch and bite are not going to be either your favorite, or your child's preferred for a snack to be sure.  You will hate the mess they make, and the kiddies will have a tendency to run off and ask for Oreo's in the market.  In conclusion, I can only find myself honestly recommending these crackers for the true stout hearted health nut who may very well be used to such substandard taste and consistency is snacks like this.  They certainly are not completely tasteless to be sure, and the price of them here on Amazon is quite good for something in comparison from your local market. Then of course there is their better nutritional value. I suggest considering all the facts as to how much taste and nutrition is important to you in a cracker such as this, and then basing your decision from there if they are worth it or not...

review/text: I was very anxious to try these graham crackers which seemed healthier that the Honey Maid brand we have purchased in the past.<br />Once we opened the box, we found that the crackers were broken into loads of small pieces.  Despite this the had a decent taste, albeit a bit dry, but not bad with a cup of coffee or something to wash them down with.<br /><br />We were pleased with the recycled packaging, but there was nothing exceptional about these crackers. Again, good enough, but we probably would not purchase these in the future unless they were available at a really terrific price.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I was skeptical about trying these graham crackers. I was really surprised by how good they were. They are made with whole wheat flour and also contain oatmeal and honey. They are just sweet enough to satisfy your sweet tooth but not too sweet. They are crispy, even though they are thicker than traditional grahams, and the flavor of the oats really comes through. These are a nice change from the usual thin, overly sweet graham crackers. While it has nothing to do with how good the crackers are, I really liked the fact that they are packaged in 100% recycled materials.

review/summary: Very light, airy and pleasant
review/text: We are fans of the Back to Nature company.  We particularly enjoy their stick cookies and they are a favorite of my kids (ages 4 and 2).  We tried these as well as the Apple cinnamon version of the Graham crackers and are pleased.<br /><br />They are lighter and slightly more cracker-like (i.e., bread-like) than the usual super-granular, very sugary grahams that we are accustomed to.  The flavor was subtle but pleasant, not cloying or overpowering in any way.  These are made with fairly "natural" ingredients, which is particularly nice in an era of high-fructose corn syrup in everything.<br /><br />Subtle but very pleasant, I had trouble stopping after 1 or 2... I recommend these as a lighter, healthier option to traditional Grahams, but caution that they may not scratch an itch for the more sugary variants.

review/summary: Back to Nature Honey Oat Graham Crackers
review/text: These crackers are really good but I do think that the Apple Cinnamon has a better flavor. I guess it would really just fall upon what your personal preferences are though. I'm looking for something healthier that doesn't taste like Styrofoam and this seems to be a nice alternative. 100% Natural, hmmm, I didn't know Monocalcium Phosphate grew on trees, hehe. Also, it seems a bit high in calories. 110 calories and 2.5 grams of fat for 2 cracker sheets... just seems like a lot to me. Honestly I don't really care because it still seems better than most of the garbage out there, but if you're really a purist, I just thought you might like to know. For me they're outstanding and incredibly delicious and I will definitely be buying them again.

review/summary: I'm Disappointed
review/text: Since I'm a big fan of the Back to Nature Honey Graham Sticks, I was really looking forward to giving these a try.  Despite the 7 grams of sugar per 30 gram serving, I found these a bit bland & I was searching for more of a honey flavor.  Perhaps I'd like these better with more cinnamon added.  I think the raisin paste in these may be the offending ingredient/flavor for me & I would have preferred having that replaces with more honey.<br /><br />To me, these taste like a cross between a whole wheat cracker and a graham cracker-not sweet enough & a little too "wheaty."  On the up side, the 100% natural ingredients are a plus, as is the eco-friendly box they come in.

review/summary: Gives Natural Foods a Bad Name
review/text: I am a big fan of natural foods and eco-responsible packaging which is what drew me to this product.  The company has done a great job with its efforts towards sustainability in packaging but based on the cracker itself, I wondered if they had used the same materials for what was inside the box as well.  The crackers were dry, crumbly, shed the oat flakes readily and lacked much in the way of flavor.  If you are looking for a vehicle for peanut butter or some other food item, this is a fine product  but it really adds little else to the eating experience.  The crackers are scored but due to inadequate depth or their hard consistency, breaking them evenly is not possible.  If you must have graham crackers without high fructose corn syrup, this would be a perfectly acceptable product but I would sooner eliminate them from my diet than purchase these.

The texture is a little crunchy, but you get use to it pretty quickly.  It has a nice honey and oats taste with a hint of cinnamon.  It is low in sugar (7g), and has 21 grams of carbohydrate, which makes this a nice option when I go on my long runs and need something to refuel.  Honestly, I think this is the best all natural cracker I've ever tasted, and the kids also like it. Back to Nature has done a great job.

The flavor is just right, not overly sweet but sweetened just enough with quality sweeteners to make them a real treat.  The ingredients list is a thing to behold!!  Nothing you would not want to put in your body.  The rolled oats are very apparent adding a new texture to an old favorite.  A full sized wafer (which can be snapped into four pieces) has 55 calories.  I applaud the makers of this delightful treat for their innovative and healthy recipe!!

review/summary: *Crisp* And Semi-Sweet Graham Cracker; Not Bad!
review/text: The BACK TO NATURE HONEY OAT GRAHAM CRACKERS aren't too bad. They're made with healthier ingredients like whole grain wheat flour and whole grain rolled oats - although they aren't 100% whole grain - and no added high fructose corn syrup or artificial flavor like the more popular brand <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G4LRDI">Nabisco Honey Maid Graham Crackers 4 Pack Value Box</a>.<br /><br />Each cracker comes on a sheet of four, and they have a semi-sweet taste with a slight hint of cinnamon. They're very crisp and provide a nice crunch, so they're pretty good if you need a little snack, but some might find them on the dry side.<br /><br />If you're used to eating the Honey Maid brand graham cracker, like I am, you won't be fooled by BACK TO NATURE, but these provide a healthier alternative especially if you're trying to cut out corn syrup and other additives from your diet, and they taste pretty close to the other brand. I like them and so I'll be making the switch to these.

review/summary: A pleasant surprise
review/text: Normally I'm a little skeptical about "natural" food products. Much of the time, it's a big company jumping on the "Natural and Organic" bandwagon by fudging the descriptions.  And if it's genuinely good for you, it frequently tastes like sawdust.  Back to Nature's grahams are a pleasant exception to the rule.  They're not only made with good, honest ingredients (No HFCS)they taste good.  And they come in a recycled paperboard box.  Minimal recycled packaging and good-for-you ingredients?  Score.<br /><br />However... do not make the mistake of assuming that because the name is "Golden Honey Oat" that they're sweetened only with honey.  Not so.  The primary sweetener is evaporated cane juice (AKA unrefined sugar.  The corn council is not the only group that changes names to mislead.) so if you're cane sugar phobic, don't bother with these.  They also have honey -- yes there's some in there -- brown rice syrup and raisin paste. The good news is that they're not all that sweet in spite of the four separate sweeteners.  If, like me, you do not share the American obsession with tooth-achingly sweet foods, then these will appeal to you.<br /><br />Based on the current price on Amazon.com as of this writing, the cost of these breaks down to about $0.35 per ounce which puts them slightly above the lower end of supermarket graham cracker prices.  For what you're getting, that's a pretty good deal.

review/summary: Very good taste, only slightly sweet. One point deducted for all the crumbs.
review/text: This brand of graham crackers is decidedly less sweet than the other types that I have had over the years. I like this less sweet flavor and can see it being paired with toppings that might not go well with sweeter crackers. I also think that these crackers would make a lovely pie crust for those who prefer their desserts on the less-sweet side.<br /><br />The only problem that I have with these crackers is that they make A LOT of crumbs. I opened a pack at my desk and ate two. By the time that was done, I had an inordinate amount of crumbs on my desk; much more than with any other cracker or cookie I have eaten previously.

Taste is very good, not too sweet yet very pleasant.  One of the better Graham Crackers that I have enjoyed.<br /><br />Healthy ingredients:<br /><br />- Whole Grain (Wheat and Oats!)  19g in Apple Cinnamon and 20g in Golden Honey.<br /><br />- Sea Salt (I have seen research indicating that sea salt raises blood pressure less than normal refined salt)<br /><br />- No High Fructose Corn Syrup  (High Fructose is associated with early aging of the skin)<br /><br />- No hydrogenated Oils (Hydrogenated oils tend to clog the arteries)<br /><br />- No artificial Preservatives, flavors or colors.<br /><br />I am glad I tried the product.

review/summary: Pleasant tasting - Not too sweet - Very dry!
review/text: I received mine through the mail so when I opened the box, the Oat Graham Crackers were broken in quite a few pieces. On the box it says 1 serving size is 2 full cracker sheets - 4 crackers per sheet. If you are watching sodium content (130 mg - 1 serving), for example, it would be important that they are more or less in one piece inside a package. Trying to put them together with a spoon was not very successful.<br /><br />I found them to be a pleasant tasting cracker, but very dry.  You definitely need to be drinking something while eating them. I didn't feel like making a bunch of Smores with them :) They are quite different from the "graham cracker" I would normally eat. There are no artificial preservatives, flavors or colors, no high fructose corn syrup and no hydrogenated oils.  For me, personally, they would be a good diet cracker because I would not be tempted to sit and eat the entire box at one sitting.<br /><br />I would definitely keep them on a shelf for those snack times when I feel the need for a healthy cracker and when I don't want to over-eat.

review/summary: Healthier Graham Cracker
review/text: First, let me say that I am very happy that this manufacture is trying to create a healthier product and is also trying to package their product using a lot of recyclable or sustainable materials.  These points alone encourage me to consider this product over dominate corporate graham cracker manufactures that has lost their way.<br /><br />Each individual box contains three packets of graham crackers containing 7 crackers each (21 total crackers per box).  Oddly enough, I couldn't find any mention of this on the packaging.<br /><br />The taste I find just average and bit on the dry side.  Make sure you have something to wash them down with, but that's true of most graham crackers.  I'm not sure what they could do to make it taste better as I've never made graham crackers myself.  The added oats are a nice touch but since they are sprinkled on the top they often fall off as you pull them out of the packaging.  I wonder why they didn't just mix the oats in the batter?  I've also tried the apple cinnamon flavor and would rate the taste a bit more satisfying than the honey flavor.<br /><br />All in all, I do recommend these crackers despite the 3/5 rating but namely for the healthier ingredients.  And for the record, I do not think I've ever had a 5/5 graham cracker.  :)<br /><br />PROS<br />====<br />+ Healthy core ingredients compared to many competitors.  For example, normal sugar instead of corn syrup and sea salt (extra minerals) instead of standard salt<br />+ No artificial colors or preservatives<br />+ Pro environment packaging<br /><br />CONS<br />====<br />- Vast majority of crackers broken<br />- Oats easily fall off crackers<br />- Taste is average (also a tad dry and slightly rough on the mouth compared Nabisco)<br />- Inconsistent or inadequate perforations making it hard to break crackers in half or fourths

I got them from Amazon Vine to review.<br /><br />- Amazon doesn't "pay me to sit here eating cookies." Why would I come to work if Amazon paid me? I just get the cookies sent free and I have to review them.<br /><br />- Yes, I have a review. No, it's not one of those convoluted sort-of-funny ramblings. In fact, it's only four words - "Good, but not great."<br /><br />- I know that doesn't tell you much. What I mean is that I liked them, but if I never ate any more I wouldn't have my life collapse.<br /><br />- Well, a review is what I think. Some people will agree, some won't.<br /><br />- Since you insist that you still don't know whether you like them, have one. Ah yes, I have one left.<br /><br />- No I don't mind giving you the last one. I would mind even less if there was another packet.<br /><br />- Yes, then I suppose I wouldn't be giving the last one if there was another packet.<br /><br />- Well, thanks for leaving me half.<br /><br />- Oh dear, you actually agree with me on the taste! Funny that.<br /><br />- Well, I must get on. If you could sit back a bit, I can close the drawer -<br /><br />- Yes, there is another box. It's a different flavor, that's all. There's a third of a box left, and my opinion of the others is exactly the same as the one you just tried. So I don't need to offer you one, do I, since you're only eating them for review purposes.<br /><br />- No, I've done more than just eating them. I did a bit of research on Google, because the whole "recycled package" box goes with a tale of how a few people started "Back to Nature" in California or Washington State or Vermont or Maine. But there is no story like that. So I looked around and found that "Back to Nature" is owned by Kraft Foods - not that there's anything wrong in that - but they don't put that on the outside of the box.<br /><br />- Yeah, I will probably put that in the review. One good thing is that because I have the same opinion on both the Apple Cinnamon and Golden Honey, I will put the same review on both pages.<br /><br />- Yes, I suppose that does me a lazy slob. But at least I don't prowl the cubicles looking for free food.

I will say one thing--it's rare that what's in the package tastes just LIKE the package.<br /><br />Avoid.

review/text: Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams have a nice, understated flavor and none of the undesirable qualities (cardboard-like texture, overall boring experience) that often mar other healthy, whole-grain products.  As said, though, the taste IS subtle and understated, so if you're looking for fireworks in your mouth, an explosion of sweetness, etc., these might not be for you.  But, heck, they're graham crackers, right, so what are you expecting?  To me, an exciting graham cracker is one that delivers a top-notch graham cracker experience (not worrying about being anything else), and if it can do so with a little less processing, that really IS exciting.  Anyway, my Amazon Vine sample was a crispy, tasty treat, and I'll look for these again when I'm in the mood for more graham crackers.

review/summary: I had a hard time getting them away from my wife...
review/text: I found these grahams to be very good.  I think the thing I like most about them is the crisp texture.  If you have eaten a Nabisco honey graham cracker lately you will probably remember that while they may seem somewhat crisp when you first open a packet of them, they soon absorb every water vapor molecule in the room and get sort of soft.  Anyway, the "Back to Nature" grahams don't do this!  They are crisp, and have a good flavor.  I rate them higher than Nabisco's.<br /><br />Here's what my wife had to say about them...<br /><br />You know me- you just can't stop me from being ultra helpful.  In that vein, I decided to open up your Vine grahams box and give them a whirl.  LOVE them.  LOVE everything about them.  One a scale from 1-5 stars, they are a 6.  I am sure the price isn't cheap, but if money wasn't an issue, I would buy them exclusively and eat them daily.  They are better than Oreos and even healthy.  In fact, you feel like you are doing something virtuous for your tongue and you abs.  Super crunchy and loaded with flavor.  I am going to hide them from the kids and splurge myself- the kids can eat the Goldfish.  Love the enviro-freindly packaging too (minimum of 55% recycled cardboard), as well as their support of The Nature Conservancy.  Whole grains (wheat and oats) at their finest.<br /><br />So, all in all, as far as graham crackers go, these are top notch.  They don't taste like health food while being healthy, and at the same time allowing us to contribute to a good cause!<br /><br />5 stars!

review/summary: Love these Grahams!
review/text: First the graham crackers themselves:  They are delicious - what more can I say?  I normally only buy graham crackers to grind up and use as a pie crust.  These I like to eat by themselves as a snack - they are truly that good.  Second, they are good for you.  They use whole grain flour and wholesome ingredients - I don't feel guilty eating them or feeding them to my kids.<br /><br />Next - the packaging: Excellent.  The packaging is made from recycled materials - more than half from post consumer waste.  And the inks are from vegetables so are safe and biodegradable.<br /><br />This company has done a wonderful job at producing an awesome product - way to go!

review/summary: Healthier Options Are Better with Back to Nature
review/text: I choose this item because of my wellness journey I started back in 2008. I try to eat low fat and remain conscientious of the earth and all its inhabitants. Back to Nature did a great job with the design of this box. It looks great from its simple earthy color to the feel of the cardboard. Staying true to nature you won't find a lot of frills built into this box.<br /><br />It looks like the item is retailing for upwards of $3.70 very comparable to what most crackers are selling for. Inside the box you get four sleeves of crackers with seven crackers in each. The crackers have the perfect name "Golden Honey Oat Graham" you can see the oats and taste the honey and graham. In each bit you get the gentle sweetness of honey balanced with the taste of graham we've come to enjoy.<br /><br />Good news....<br />I can eat these crackers without all the guilt of other brands because Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Graham crackers are made w/out refined sugar, trans fat and hydrogenated oils.<br /><br />Bad news...<br />Be careful exercise portion control because its very easy to eat the whole sleeve or even the box they are so good and wholesome.<br />Yummy<br /><br />Missy

review/summary: Not a big difference over traditional graham crackers
review/text: I like to think I am a fairly healthy eater. I was interested in this product being a good alternative to traditional grahams (which overall aren't the worst things in the world). However, I just cannot recommend them based on thier price and taste vs. a traditional cracker.<br /><br />Taste wise they remind me of graham cracker mated to one of those nature valley style granola bars. You know the pressed flat kind made mostly of oats that come two an individual package. I think a regular graham cracker tastes much better. Apparently my 4 year does as well (loves graham crackers) as she took one bite of one of these I had given her and immediately returned the rest and refused to eat anymore. It isn't that these are inedible by any means. I finished off the box and it wasn't "work" to do so, they just taste a little bland and (my opinion) not as good as a regular graham. (For some reason they are really prone to breakage. Might just have been shipping, but all were in several irregular pieces)<br /><br />Do the "heathier" ingredients make it worth while to spend more and get less taste? I compared the nutritional numbers and ingredients on these to a box of discount store graham crackers we had on hand. Discount brand is about 1/3 the price per box, so huge difference there. As far as the protein, carbs, fats, type of fats, and carb/sugar percentage it was pretty much a wash with a very slight edge (like 1/2 gram of fat and 1 gram of sugar) going to the Back to Nature brand being reviewed here. The ingredient list between these and traditional grahams isn't that far off either.<br /><br />Taste and price easily go to the traditional graham cracker. Nutritional value does go to the Back to Nature branded product but it my opinion, only by the slightest of margins and not by enough to justify the huge price premium.

review/summary: Perfection! (in a graham cracker?) YES!
review/text: Don't let the "naysayers" here throw you off. This is one of those products that is best evaluated when you do it yourself and not rely on others' views to decide for you whether or not these crackers are worthy.<br /><br />A lifetime fan of grahams and other similar cookies or crackers, I was actually eager to try these (having read the ingredients beforehand), and broke right into them the moment they arrived with a pot of Earl Gray.<br /><br />My first thoughts were "my gosh this is a small box" as the stacks are smaller and the package only holds three of them. But, upon trying the first one, I was thoroughly taken with their extra crunch, their thickness, the very light hint of honey, and also just a trace of cinnamon...nothing was a clear standout, and this was very refreshing and indeed "tasty" on my pallet. I ate the whole stack.<br /><br />These grahams were more filling and way more satisfying to my taste buds, and the decision was clear that I would be passing over my favorites for years (Keebler and Nabisco), which now seem dry, powdery, and way more sugary-sweet along with an overdose of cinnamon in the case of that flavor variety. I will still be buying the chocolate versions however until Back to Nature perhaps introduces a chocolate of their own.<br /><br />Everything about this product and its packaging will put a genuine smile on your face and in your heart by knowing that you are serving yourself, family and friends a totally healthy whole grain treat vs the competition's offerings. Even the package is made from recycled material and that makes me very happy, sort of a plus on top of being so pleased and satisfied with the contents it holds.<br /><br />Like others, I received my sample through Vine, and despite claims of others regarding being broken, they arrived in perfect condition. The only problem was that they left me wanting for more!<br /><br />This is the most satisfactory snack product that I have come across in a very long time. Do yourself and family a favor and give these a try...I think you will be pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />~operabruin

review/summary: WOW!!!  Actual Taste
review/text: Because of my medical issues I am rather limited in the foods I can eat and tasty snacks are few and far between.<br /><br />I fell in love with the wonderful taste of these,like the Graham Crackers when I was a kid... and because of the wholesome ingredients like whole grains and a bit of real sugar instead of the awful High Fructose Corn Syrup I can easily enjoy a couple of these without spiking my blood sugar.<br /><br />I read some of the other reviews here that didn't enjoy the taste,it seems like people now are programmed to pile the sweetening on or their damaged taste buds don't register flavor. These tasty treats are subtle and a joy to eat along with a coffee or tea.<br /><br />I'm enjoying these so much that I've reordered both flavors and can't wait to taste the Apple Cinnamon as well.<br /><br />We Love These!!!!

The Back to Nature Oat Grahams are not very sweet and are rather bland tasting. On the plus side they are crunchy and the kids enjoyed dunking them in milk.<br /><br />  All the graham crackers in the separate packages (3) were broken which was rather annoying and messy. The oats that are on top of the cracker just fell off. They added no extra flavor either.<br /><br />  My kids enjoyed them but would prefer if I went back to our regular choice of Honey Maid Graham crackers.

review/summary: True to the original spirit of Graham crackers.
review/text: Rev. Sylvester Graham created the original Graham crackers as part of a diet based on the theory "that one could curb one's sexual appetite by eating bland foods." [Wikipedia; "Graham cracker" accessed 21 MAR 2011].<br /><br />These crackers are true to the spirit of Rev. Graham's intent.  They are devoid of flavor, and possess the texture of the most delicate particle board.  While nutritious in the strictest sense, there is a surprising amount of salt (130mg or 5% of the "daily value" per 28 grams of cracker).  While not noticably salty, it baffles me why they bothered to add salt when they had clearly passed on any other flavor.<br /><br />And eating even one suppressed any urge to take pleasure in life.<br /><br />Don't bother, unless these are going to be used as some form of punishment.<br /><br />E.

The grahams have a delicious and delicate taste. The honey is not cloying and the texture is definitely benefited by the addition of oats - not too chewy and not too crunchy. Just right. I could see myself happily melting marshmallows and chocolate between two of these graham crackers, on a hot, summer night - or simply snacking on them, right out of the box with a cup of milk.  Yum.

review/text: These graham crackers have a distinctive whole grain flavor and texture.  They are tastier than the usual graham cracker. Sweetness(from natural sweeteners, like raisin paste and sugar cane juice) dominates the flavor, however, and some of the subtlety of the other flavors are masked. I would have been happier if they used less sweetener. But, overall, this is a gutsy cracker!

review/summary: A little too "rough" for me sometimes
review/text: I know these aren't typical graham crackers. They are more like oatmeal/graham crackers which makes the texture different. They are harder and more coarse than the kind I am used to and do have a slightly less sweet flavor. I don't think I would like something like a light pie crust or s'more made with these, but for something more substantial (like an apple crisp or tart) they add a nice, more-mealy touch. Eating right out of the box is fine, but they are more along the line of a granola bar rather than a cookie. And sometimes I am in the mood for a cookie-type thing. These won't satisfy that craving for me. They're different, but good in their own right. Just don't expect them to really be the same as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OBYNQW">Keebler Graham</a> type of cracker.

Especially in this case, the whole grain really improves the taste of the crackers. They taste richer and more complex than regular graham crackers, a little heartier but not heavier. I used some of them in mini cheesecakes and everyone raved about the crust, asking what I added to it to make it so good.<br /><br />A couple of reviews felt these were a bit drier than regular crackers. I compared them to the store brand I had in my cabinet and really didn't find them to be drier than the store brand.  They are richer but have more flavor than the store brand.<br /><br />This is a great healthy version of a comfort food snack, I highly recommend!

I think both of these are a result of the lack of random binders and preservatives from other brands and I don't think they really detract from the product at all.

review/summary: Healthier but Just as Tasty
review/text: If I can choose a product that is as tasty but more healthy for me and my family, that is what I do.  The real challenge for healthier or "natural" products is often their price.  This seems fairly reasonably especially if you can find it in stores where you do regular grocery shopping.  They do have more fiber and more whole grains and if you want more if that in your diet these will provide a bit more.  The taste pleased everyone in my family when we tried the box we were sent.<br /><br />The crackers tend to be break a bit more off line than the general big brand graham crackers and these seemed a bit thicker as well.  Not a big problem I think since cheap definitely far less healthy ones tend to be thinner but also break off line more easily.<br /><br />Ultimately these are not as healthy as fresh fruit or veggies but if you are used to have graham crackers as a treat or part of a dessert and can find these, they are a touch more fiber and a touch less sugar than the regular brands.

review/text: I love graham crackers.  When I was a kid I had one of those buzzy toys where you could shape the graham cracker and then decorate the graham cracker.  So I expected the graham cracker to be sweet and desert like but also good for you.  It did have that sweet taste but it was so dry.  There was definitely an oat like taste to it - making it a little harder to chew.  I just did not enjoy the flavor, texture or how dry it was.  I give it points for having no artificial ingredients, no high fructose corn syrup and using whole grain oats.

review/text: I enjoyed these graham crackers and liked knowing that they were made with natural ingredients.  You can see the whole grains on the crackers.  The taste of these is exactly like regular graham crackers but with a heartier taste.  They make a good snack.

review/text: Delicious and tasty!  We were so glad to find a graham cracker without any hydrogenated oil in it.  These do make a great snack by themselves, but can also be used with cream cheese or other favorite toppings.  Highly recommended as party snacks.  These would also be a welcome healthy way to make a pie crust.

review/summary: healthy-tasting crackers
review/text: Compared to other graham crackers, they are slightly more dry and slightly less sweet. They do have a heavy, substantial, oaty texture that I kind of liked - makes them feel like a breakfast food and not just an after-school snack. They are more messy than other graham crackers though; they don't break evenly and generate a ton of crumbs.<br /><br />They are labeled "100% Natural" with no high fructose corn syrup, and even the packaging is made from 100% recycled paper and printed with inks from vegetable renewable resources. So if this is important to you, these crackers will be a good pick. They taste good enough to me.

review/text: Usually these kind of snacks end up tasting like the box to me, but these were very good.  They are sort of like a graham cracker, but better.  It seemed the more I ate them, the more I liked them.  I reach for them more than any other snack on my shelf.  Really like dunking them in milk too.  Only drawback, is that thee is a touch of cinnamon in them so I had to warn my houseguest who is allergic to cinnamon not to eat them.  (which just left more for me!)

review/summary: A Tasty & Healthy Graham Cracker
review/text: I'll make no qualms about the fact that I love graham crackers and graham cracker like products like Teddy Grahams. Almost nothing beats a cup of hot chocolate and a graham cracker or two on a cold winter evening in my book.<br /><br />That said, I recently had the opportunity to try out Back to Nature 100% Natural Golden Honey Oat Graham Crackers. My verdict? They're a delicious and healthier way of eating graham crackers.<br /><br />The size of the product is similar to Nabisco's Honey Grahams. Each cracker is perforated into four evenly sized pieces. The texture is much rougher and heartier than what you would find in Honey Grahams with oat pieces that are discernible in the crackers. Because of the texture and heartier composition these grahams are a bit more brittle than Nabisco's product. Though my box arrived with mostly intact crackers.<br /><br />I found the taste of the Back to Nature grahams to be comparable to Honey Grahams but not nearly as sweet or intense. Personally, I'm willing to compromise some of the taste for a healthier snack and these crackers fit the bill perfectly. Back to Nature proudly labels the front of the box with "no artificial preservatives, flavors or colors and no high fructose corn syrup". Sounds good to me!<br /><br />Each box contains 3 individually wrapped packages containing seven graham crackers. One serving equals two full crackers sheets with 110 calories, 2.5g of fat and 21g of carbs.<br /><br />Recommended.

Back To Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams are only mildly sweet, but the taste seems to be of flavorful grains and nuts (although these are not nut cookies.)<br /><br />Why waste any more time telling you about them, I'm just going to make another cup of coffee and have another cracker or two.

review/summary: A suitable and healthier alternative to the Honey Maid Grahams
review/text: These Golden Honey Oat Graham crackers are pretty good when dunked in tea but they do lack any substantial flavor. Two cracker sheets are 110 calories and are about equivalent in size to 1-1/2 sheets of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G4LRDI">Nabisco Honey Maid Graham Crackers 4 Pack Value Box</a>.  Graham flour (whole grain wheat flour), whole grain rolled oats, and evaporated cane juice are the top three ingredients.<br /><br />I like that the texture is crisp but as a result of this they are not as "pliable" as the Honey Maid Grahams so that the crackers break easily.  My evaluation box arrived smashed with some crackers broken.  Besides the easy breakage, the other negative is that 90% of the oats fall off when picking up the cracker so you are left with a pile of oat crumbs in the package.<br /><br />Other than these two negatives, the taste is pretty good when dunked in tea; however, I found them too dry to eat without dunking. This is a healthier alternative than the Honey Maid Grahams--that's if you can call crackers "healthy."  If you are looking for outstanding taste, then pass on these crackers and try their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BKHX1Y">Back To Nature Apple Cinnamon Oat Grahams, 10-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> instead.

review/text: I love the concept of a healthier graham cracker, and this one is very tasty. All you notice is the honey graham -- the oats don't interfere with the flavor. The cracker is just a little dry, so I found that I needed to have a drink nearby to balance it out. That's the only reason it doesn't get five stars. Otherwise, this is a great idea and it was well executed. Very yummy!

review/text: I selected both this & the apple cinnamon crackers at the same time, so after loving the apple cinnamon ones I was sure that I'd be equally as enthusiastic over these crackers as well. Unfortunately I wasn't as happy with these.<br /><br />PROS: Good crunch & for a graham cracker they're pretty good for you.<br /><br />Cons: Hard to break apart cleanly, crumbles a bit. Sort of a bland flavor.<br /><br />These crackers do have an overall good taste to them but they don't really have a flavor that really stands out against other graham crackers. The fact that they'd be hard to break apart would be something I'd be willing to overlook if they had a great flavor, but these just didn't thrill me like the apple cinnamon crackers did.

review/summary: A Healthy Alternative To Traditional Graham Crackers
review/text: These taste amazing!  The company didn't get the flavor exactly the same as a box of Nabisco grahan crackers, but it is darn close.  The health factors are a good balance because these aren't the healthiest things on the planet but they have a great taste which is hard to get without sugar.  Overall, these are very healthy and they are a good source of whole grains.  Of course, they are also expensive.  Ounce for ounce they are more than double the cost of graham crackers and my store puts Nabisco on sale BOGO often enough to make these effectively 4 times the price.  Plus you have to buy 6 boxes at a time to get that price.  Since price is a consideration, I won't purchase these again.  However, if you are less thrifty than me, and you want a good cracker at any price, these are right up your alley!

review/text: These graham crackers shine as an organic-ish product:  natural ingredients, sustainable packaging & production, etc.  As for the taste, they are good but not great.  And I REALLY wanted to love these crackers.  The oatmeal pieces are a nice touch on the crackers, but they fall away quickly.  Unlike most graham crackers I've eaten in my life, these are on the drier side and will leave you begging for some coffee or milk.  I don't know what's missing?  Maybe a little more honey or whatever else it is that makes graham crackers moist would do the trick.<br /><br />Overall, I don't know that I'd go out of my way to buy these but if I had to choose between others on the shelf this would probably win in a holistic sense.  Others will surely disagree, but I give them the nod of approval.

review/text: Graham Crackers may not seem like something that needs reinvented. As a child, I always thought of them somewhere between eating a cookie and a saltine cracker, though much closer to a cookie, since they were part of a quick desert rotation. Like anything else, some are better than others, whether just lacking a clear taste or enough cinnamon sugar coating. I decided to give Back to Nature's Golden Honey Oat Graham Crackers a chance. The front of the box boasts 100% Natural and no artificial ingredients or high fructose corn syrup. They're also made with whole wheat and oats, which I thought would make them more substantial than something made by Nabisco or Keebler. But would they taste like the recycled paperboard box they came in? They are delicious, with a balance of evaporated cane juice and honey that prevents the grains from overpowering. They're good enough for a snack or dessert, but be careful, or you may eat a whole package, they're that satisfying! I would be happy to add these into my diet, which yes, does involve whole grains.

review/summary: A bit on the dry side
review/text: Due to health concerns I'm always on the hunt for healthier eating alternatives, i.e. whole grains and vegetarian options to red meat, so I'm rather used to eating things that might not be as palatable to the public at large (gag, those meatless breakfast sausages). While I see from some of the reviews that some find these crackers terribly dry, they weren't quite as terribly dry for me as I'm rather used to things on the dry side. Hope that makes sense :)<br /><br />I also watch the sodium and sugar content, so Graham crackers are pretty much off the table, and if and when I do reach for crackers it's going to be something made with whole grains as these are. I did enjoy these, despite a somewhat dry taste and didn't feel the need to top them off with something else. There's a pleasant light sweetness to them, although I was hoping it was from honey and not ingredient #3, "evaporated cane juice" among other sweeteners (no honey listed) and I'm knocking off one star for that. The whole grain flavor is very much present, but I enjoy having that so that was a plus for me. A serving size per the Nutrition Facts is two crackers and has 130mg of sodium (5% of daily value) and 7g of sugar, so that is something to take into consideration.<br /><br />The outer packaging is made from "100% recycled paperboard", which earns extra points from me. Inside the box the crackers are separated into three individually wrapped sections like normal grahams are. I did have some broken pieces so be warned if your kiddos are fussy about that or planning a smores fest. I would enjoy these for an occasional treat, but they're not something that I could put into my daily diet.

review/summary: Touch of honey spices up these whole grain wheat crackers
review/text: If you are looking for whole grain wheat flour healthy graham crackers to add to your diet, then consider checking these out. The touch of honey gives them a subtle sweetness that makes them tasty enough to eat without complaining about eating cardboard :) This is a health food item, so if you are expecting it to taste like sugary fatty cookies, you will be disappointed. The back of the box prominently promotes 20g of whole grain per serving, no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup, no artificial preservatives, no flavors, no colors.<br /><br />The Nutrition Facts label is confused - it makes you pause and think in order to figure out what exactly a serving is. So let me reset it - the box includes three sealed wrappers with seven cracker-sheets each. The serving size mentioned on the box is two cracker sheets. Each cracker sheet, based on the pictures on the box, is supposed to have perforations so you can break it into four smaller crackers. That's where the serving size of 8 crackers comes from. None of the cracker sheets I got had any visible perforations like the ones in the pictures. Not an issue for me, but if you need a smaller serving size, or perhaps for a party or an event, do take that into consideration. Nutrition-wise, they have 2g of fiber and 2g of protein per serving, 7g of sugars, and 130mg of sodium (5% RDA).<br /><br />[...]<br />To summarize, these exceeded my expectations in terms of taste. I expected cardboard taste, but instead, I got something that I could eat even on its own - accompanied with some water or tea or something like that.

review/text: These graham crackers have that lovely and distinctive "digestive biscuit" or "sweetmeal biscuit" texture after a crisp crunch, a classic semi-sweet taste and a fantastic very dry feel in the mouth that wants to be enjoyed with tea or juice. They have a delicious warm flavor and a crisp fresh crunch, they lose so much if they are even a little bit stale so take care of them! The are dusted with whole oats, which makes them delicious in appearance but a little messy in practice. We just adored these in comparison to the overly sweet (and terribly American) high fructose corn syrup "cookies" that graham crackers tend to be. Highly recommended for a satisfying snack that's not too sweet. I imagine a pie crust made with these crumbs would be awe-inspiring. This is the good stuff!

review/summary: Prefer them to my "regular" graham cracker
review/text: Graham crackers with a bit of peanut butter on them have always been a favorite snack of mine since I was small.  My mother often had that snack waiting for me when I came home from school.  I still will have that combination, along with a banana, for lunch from time to time.  When given the opportunity to try a new and different cracker, I jumped at the chance.<br /><br />After eating this product numerous times, I have to say that I strongly prefer the taste of this cracker to what I normally buy (the major force in the market).  The honey flavor is strong but not too strong and actually adds quite a bit when mixed with the peanut butter.  The honey flavor also makes this more appealing to me when eaten "naked" as a snack.  When you add in the better ingredients and the 100% whole grain, I doubt I will ever buy my traditional graham cracker again, except for use when making s'mores.<br /><br />I am a total convert to this product!

Personally, I can take it or leave it but, when I saw "Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Graham" on the VINE, I thought I'd make it possible for an expert to review the product.  She said that the graham crackers are very tasty and they go well with milk (a requirement for her).  She is conscientious about what she eats and enjoys the fact that Back to Nature IS healthy.  I asked her if she would pay more for "Back to Nature" than the regular brand and she said YES!

review/summary: Great Taste, Great Packaging, Great Quality
review/text: No matter how "good for you" a product might be for me it means little unless the product tastes good.<br /><br />This is a great tasting product.  The cracker is a little bit dryer than standard graham crackers.  However it does not distract form taste or texture of the product.<br /><br />I can read the ingredient list and understand clearly what is in the product.<br /><br />While I am impressed with the taste and quality of the product I am even more so impressed with the packaging.  It is 100% recycled paperboard with a minimum of 55% post-consumer content).  The inks are from renewable sources.  The packaging has a clean / natural look without high gloss or loud colors.<br /><br />Impressed with the product and how the product is packaged!

review/summary: Healthy, with an okay taste.
review/text: * No artificial ingredients.  No food coloring.<br /><br />* No high fructose corn syrup.  It's sweetened with evaporated can juice, honey, brown rice syrup, apple juice concentrate, raise paste.<br /><br />* Contains cinnamon, which is believed to help prevent adult onset diabetes.<br /><br />* (BOTH the Apple Cinnamon version of this product, and the Golden Honey version, contain BOTH cinnamon and honey.)<br /><br />* Uses whole grain wheat flour, and whole grain rolled oats.  Whole grain contains more nutrients and fiber than does processed wheat.<br /><br />The taste is okay.  Pretty much like any other graham crackers.  So if you like graham crackers, and what a healthy kind, this would fit the bill.

review/summary: Better graham crackers
review/text: This is what graham crackers are supposed to be when they grow up.  The texture is perfect, substantial and still crispy.  The actual honey comes through in the flavor profile - along with a hint of raisin and a hint of cinnamon.  Even the appearance is better than national-brands, with cute flecks of oat flakes in the dimpled golden brown crackers.  I was craving graham crackers and had just bought a package of Nabisco grahams, which have lost all appeal to me in comparison with these Back to Nature grahams.

review/summary: Great taste!
review/text: I liked these a lot. They had just a touch of sweetness, not too much, and are a great afternoon or late night snack. I was pleasantly surprised that something that is supposed to be good for you tastes this good. The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five was because the packaging left something to be desired. It was hard to open the inside package without throwing crackers everywhere, and they don't seal back up for freshness. I put mine in a ziplock bag, though, and they stayed fresh that way. Try them, you'll like them!

review/summary: Natural Alternative
review/text: Graham cracker fans looking for a natural product will probably appreciate these Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Grahams.<br /><br />I see no strange chemicals listed in the ingredients list, and even the package is made of 100% recycled paperboard.<br /><br />Do I like these as much as the traditional Nabisco Grahams?  Well, not quite as much.  These seem to lack texture -- they're kind of smooth and bland, despite a few oat flecks clinging to the surface.<br /><br />Even the package itself is a little bland and old-fashioned-looking.  It would probably be hard to spot on a store shelf.<br /><br />I'm not sure what Nabisco Grahams are selling for these days, but these seem a little pricey to me at a little more than $3 for a 10-ounce box.  Of course, many things are seeming pricey to me these days, including most snacks except popcorn you pop yourself.<br /><br />So purists and nature lovers might want to try these, but Nabisco fans will probably prefer what they know and love...

review/summary: LESS SWEET
review/text: This brand of graham crackers is decidedly less sweet than the other types that I have had over the years. I like this less sweet flavor and can see it being paired with toppings that might not go well with sweeter crackers. I also think that these crackers would make a lovely pie crust for those who prefer their desserts on the less-sweet side.

review/summary: Not too sweet and healthier than other grahams out there
review/text: My two kids are graham cracker fanatics - with number of grahams being served in preschool and at relative's houses, I'm not surprised. Unfortunately, most graham crackers are chock full of unbleached flour, hydrogenated oil, high fructose corn syrup, and lots and lots of sugar.  In fact, many other brands first ingredients are unbleached flour, sugar, and riboflavin - graham flour doesn't even show up until the fourth or fifth ingredient.<br /><br />This is where Back to Nature Graham crackers got it right: Graham flour is the first ingredient.  There's no high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated oil, and there are only whole grains included in this cracker.  In comparison to Honey Maid Crackers, there are less calories (-20), fat calories (-5), sugar (-1), and sodium (-30mg).  You also get +85mg of potassium per serving.  There are less crackers per box, however (4 full cracker sheets) in comparison to Honey Maid.<br /><br />In terms of taste and texture, I found the crackers to taste a lot less sweet than the graham crackers that I grew up with.  Initially, I found the crackers to be not sweet enough and lacking the crisp layer of sugar that most graham crackers have.  Upon eating the second cracker sheet, the missing sweetness wasn't a bad thing - instead of tasting just lots of sugar, I actually found that I enjoyed tasting the graham taste along with the oat taste.  The texture is a lot less crumbly than other graham crackers.  There are oats baked in, as well as some sprinkled on top.  The oats on top tend to come off, but is not too much of a problem because most of the oats are baked in; there are only a few sprinkled on top.  The oats may not be for everyone as you will definitely notice the added texture to the cracker.  I personally like having little bits in the crackers, however my husband found the oats to be annoying.  He doesn't care for the toppings on "everything" bagels either - so "people who don't like added nuts and seeds" beware!<br /><br />That said, I would probably suggest that if you haven't tried this graham crackers before to purchase a single box before buying a 6-pack of these crackers.  These graham crackers most likely taste nothing like the graham crackers that you grew up with.  Having been raised eating Honey Maids and Kraft Macaroni, I was pretty resistant to eating these crackers; however, I found the change to be welcome and am happy that my kids ended up liking 'em.  Recommended.
