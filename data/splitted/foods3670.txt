review/text: A friend told me about this product because I have been suffering leg cramps every night on almost an hourly basis.  I tried all the usual supplements recommended for this problem with no relief (including magnesium in tablet form)and muscle relaxers from my doctor.  This product mixed with my tea each night has been 100% relief from those nightly cramps for me.  I won't go an evening without it.  I recommend it to all my family members as this problem seems to run in my family.

review/summary: Pleasing Results
review/text: Over the past few weeks, I was analyzing my typical daily nutrition and found I was lacking in magnesium. Like most Americans, I consume much more calcium than magnesium; the ratio of calcium to magnesium intake ideally needs to be 1-1.5:1. I read the reviews and thought it would be interesting to see if I could experience the calming effect on my muscles that many other reviewers have noted.<br /><br />I take two teaspoons (dissolved into a 500 mL water bottle) about an hour before I go to bed, and I do notice a calming effect. This product does not have the effect of a hypnotic or a benzodiazepine, so one should not expect it to "knock you out." Rather, I do experience a noticeable "lightening" of the muscles. As I lie in bed, I feel more comfortable and better able to focus on feeling comfortable because the muscles all throughout my body seem to be content to be in "off" mode; they are not as easily excitable as they are on my previously magnesium-deficient diet.<br /><br />I am pleased with this product and will continue taking two teapoons in water every night. I recommend this product to all who have found that they, too, are deficient in magnesium. I also agree that this product softens the stools and provides for a pleasant midday defecation. Cheers.

review/summary: Best sleep solution for me!
review/text: I have been using the Ras-Lemon version of NC for 6 months now, and after a brief bout with 'loose bowels' in the beginning, I am still delighted with the impact on my issue with falling asleep.  Wow!  An hour or so before going to bed I have two teaspoons of this powder in a cup of hot water, and pop a melatonin tablet at the actual bedtime.  In my case it helps to avoid alcohol and food intake after 6PM. And now falling asleep is no longer a problem! What a life saver. Tastes good too! Thanks, Peter Gilliam, whoever you are :)

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I have had a "twitching eyelid" problem for over a month now.  I've had that happen a few times here and there in the past, but never like this.  This was really getting bothersome, it was doing it like every 30 minutes or so for a few seconds at a time.  From the time I woke up till the time I went to bed.  It go so bad last week, I looked up again online about it...and somehow came across a forum where someone had the same problem and someone replied "you have a magnesium deficiency".  Well then I started looking up magnesium deficency and came upon this product.  I went and bought it the next day a local store.  And guess what??  My eye twitching has almost completely come to a STOP!!!  From something that was getting to be every 20-30 min. to now it does it about 2-3 times a day, much less noticable too, the twitching isn't as severe or bothersome.<br /><br />So I would have given this 5 stars, but I am still waiting to see if this supplement helps with any of the other problems, I've noticed after reading about magnesium deficiencies.  Those would be an added bonus if it helped with my other symptoms.  I am starting out with a small amount and will work my way up, and see if it gets any better with other things.  But I think it's great for just helping with my eye, it was literally driving me crazy!!<br />So glad I came upon this product...and the taste is really not bad at all.  I mix it with a whole glass of cold water, and it really only tastes like water with a lemon wedge in it, to me anyway...Maybe a larger amount of it, in less water might be too sweet, but it's really diluted in a full glass of water, so it isn't bad at all.

Recommend it for those who get constipated (sorry about that) and for an overall feeling of calm.  My husband mixes it with his running water (he jogs) and I drink it with hot water - both ways work fine.  You'll like the taste too.  One more thing - it's cheaper purchased through Amazon - and the vendor (marketplace) will get it to you fast (with samples).

review/summary: One of the best nutritional supplements out there
review/text: A friend recommended that I try this product out due to my low blood levels of magnesium (some of the medications I was on depleted my body of Mg and K). I used to get cramping and soreness in my muscles after going for just minor walks or workouts. This product however, stopped the discomfort within hours of first taking it!<br /><br />If you read up on the side effects of low levels of Magnesium in the blood, you will be amazed to find out how many ailments result. The "Calm" is the answer without a doubt.<br /><br />I suffered from high blood pressure and hypertension for years, as well as an elevated heart rate. After taking this product, in conjunction to lifestyle changes, I began to feel better and all other cardiovascular issues normalized.<br /><br />When my doctor asked me what I changed in my life to make my numbers look better, I told her about the Calm, and she has since began using it herself and telling her other patients about it. Its a much quicker and easier way to get the essential Magnesium into your body fast and effectively. It certainly works better than trying to eat copious amounts of other Mg rich foods.<br /><br />Adhere to the serving sizes- especially at first. Magnesium makes for a darn good laxative if you take too much!!!<br /><br />This product is the cheapest here on Amazon. You'll likely spend $35-$45 at other health food stores.

review/summary: What else would you call this but "Calm?"
review/text: I had high hopes when I ordered this supplement, purportedly for one of my sons who was having some transitional stress issues...but I needed it as much (if not more.)  We have not been disappointed.  In fact, this supplement has exceeded all  hopes and expectations.  I suspect that my anxiety issues were beginning to negatively impact an important relationship. That has improved as have all my other relationships.  I am much more patient and centered, much less needy.  I have also noticed that there are no more occasional heart palpitations, no more twitchy legs either...no twitches of any kind. Also, as a budding middle-aged runner, this product IS helpful with muscle recovery.  I wish we had known about this product when our younger son was running track and cross country in high school.  It would have been tremendously helpful.  As others have noted, "Calm" is a wonderful aid in getting a restful night's sleep. A good night's sleep in-and-of itself is tremendously important to one's overall health. I will try never let myself run out of this supplement.  What a discovery!

review/summary: Hooked on this!
review/text: I'm a huge skeptic, but after 6 months of daily use, I do agree that this stuff is a necessary supplement in my life.  When I skip a couple days, I'm reminded.  I take it at night and it improves my otherwise slow system by the morning.  I continued being skeptical but noticed a marked improvement in my sleeping (more relaxed) and some muscle damage I had in my leg quickly healed (after one year of pain from an injury!).  I started off slow and had to graduate to a high dose - appx 3-4 tsp per day (was having serious constipation) -- after a week or so, I tapered down to a normal dose. I got my husband hooked on this stuff for the 'relaxing' effect alone (he is on the higher energy side).  It's subtle, not a drugged feeling when I say relaxing effect ... it's similar to melatonin without any groggy feeling.  My primary use is for constipation ... no more garbage over the counter drugs.  I never found improvement from pro-biotics either. This stuff helps with bloating and overall "uggh" feeling.  We both really like the taste, too.  If you like it more sweet/sour, then just use less water.  It's an artificial type sweetener, so no calories ... and I normally hate artificial sweetener taste, but it's hidden well.  It's similar to crystal light ... we get the raspberry/lemon flavor.  We take one dose every night.  I highly recommend!  Your local health food store might give you a sample ... try it for a few days but don't buy it from there ... come to Amazon because it's WAY cheaper :)  Good luck!

review/summary: Helped Spouse That Has Fibromyalgia
review/text: I originally purchased Natural Calm to help with my own insomnia and anxiety issues. I started out with 1/2 teaspoon and gradually worked up to 1 teaspoon taken before bedtime. If I take more than 1 teaspoon, it has a laxative effect the next day. Even though it does help me relax, it doesn't really help with the insomnia. I've recently switched to Slow-Mag for a more sustained release of magnesium throughout the day. It doesn't have the same laxative effect, plus helps with daytime anxiety. However, my spouse (who has fibromyalgia) has had positive results with Natural Calm. It has improved his quality of sleep and also helped with muscle aches and overall fatigue. He takes about 1 to 1/2 teaspoons each night. I anticipate that he will want to continue purchasing Natural Calm. It doesn't work the same for everyone, but we are very happy with how the product has helped him so far.

review/summary: Finally good sleep
review/text: I'm a 31 year old woman and I have suffered from night terrors for my entire life. Since I started taking this supplement a couple of weeks ago I've slept through the night every night. Aside from that fact (that will keep me a customer for life on its own), I also just feel great in general. I take a teaspoon in the morning and a teaspoon in the evening which i dissolve in warm water. It tastes like a bland lemonade, which is fine by me. I'm not here for the flavor, i'm here for the health benefits. My bathroom trips are more regular and my muscles don't feel as sore after I exercise. One thing I would like to note, just in case it happens for anyone else, is that the first 3 days I was getting a pain in my temple randomly throughout the day. Research has led me to believe that this was from the artificial sweetener in the raspberry lemonade flavoring. I'm not having those pains anymore, and when I order again i'll probably stick with the same flavor. I hope this helps someone else may be on the fence about it.

This stuff is great for that. It doesn't upset my stomach like a magnesium pill sometimes can, and it tastes good, and has no sugar. Maybe it is just placebo effect, but it seems like my teeth are smoother after I swish it around in my mouth for a while. Also, it sometimes helps me relax. I certainly will continue to buy it regularly. I recommend it to my family but none of them listen to me; their loss!

review/text: I am an anxiety ridden person who just needs to calm down, so I tried this.  I think it has helped a little with restful sleep.  It also impacts bowel movements, so watch your dosage.  Read the directions: it needs to fizz in warm water before you drink it.  There's a raspberry-lemon flavor I would probably have liked better but didn't see it until after I ordered.  The flavor is bitter but it's such a small drink (2-3 oz) that it's acceptable.<br />I think valerian root works better for immediate relief.  This needs a longer time period to work well.

After going through two 8oz packages, I was unable to afford it for a while. I really felt a difference without taking my Calm Plus Calcium twice a day. I found it much harder to relax and sleep at night, and started having spasms in my leg and back again. Recently purchased this 16 oz container thru Amazon, and have been taking it regularly again, and finally the spasms are mostly gone again. I hope they never stop making this product - I suppose I could live without it, but I would rather not!

review/summary: one of my favorite supplements
review/text: Magnesium deficiency can affect all aspects of health. I have tried various magnesium supplements, and this is my favorite. I feel, as the label says in bold letters, more CALM when I take this. There is less muscle tension in my body. I enjoy the taste as well, mixed with just 3-4 ounces of hot water, for a soothing warm lemon drink. I often take this with my calcium hydroxyapatite supplements, since both will work better together.<br /><br />Down sides: Need to be careful when making it, or it will fizz itself up and out of your cup. Also, if you get loose stools, adjust your dose down because it means you are taking more than you can absorb. Unfortunately, this is also a sign that your body isn't ABLE to absorb magnesium properly, in which case you may need to look into temporary IV or topical formulas until this is addressed.

review/summary: Great for sore muscles, helps with sleep, helps with menstrual cramps.
review/text: I've been using Natural Vitality Calm magnesium powder for years. It helps me get to sleep at night, especially after a stressful day or when I'm worried. I use it after I work out at the gym; or if I've got sore muscles from other activities such as gardening or heavy lifting. It is great for "that time of the month." It helps with cramps and mood swings. Calm comes in a few different flavors such as lemon, raspberry-lemon, and orange. I like the orange flavor the best. It's easy to use. Just mix a teaspoon or more of the powder with hot water. Then add a little cold water or cold juice and drink.  A hint: If you have trouble sleeping, try taking Calm and also take Vitamin B1 about a half hour before bed, to help with sleep. My chiropractor recommended that and it works for me. The magnesium in Calm has been formulated to absorb into the body and take effect quickly. There is a little booklet that is usually attached to the canister of Calm that gives more info on all of the benefits of magnesium in this form.

review/text: I love this stuff!!!!!!! It works quickly, efficiently and tastes good too. It works for headaches, stress, mental disorders like Schizophrenia, ect...a must have for any medicaine cabinet!!!! I take this first thing in the morning upon waking because I have ADHD and Schizophrenia so this stuff helps to calm my thoughts. I take this with my morning medications and then I'm good to go for the day. Also, when I feel really stressed out I take this and it works like a charm. I believe everyone should always have a bottle of this on hand.

review/summary: Love it! - helps my stress and anxiety, sleep, and blood pressure
review/text: I'm so glad my doctor told me about this stuff.  I was having high blood pressure, anxiety attacks, just stressed out.  Also losing my hair but I haven't been taking it long enough to tell if that will help with this problem.  But, I'm not on blood pressure meds anymore, and I just feel calm, just as it is called.  Work has, and still is, very stressful, but this stuff helps me get through the day without the need to go home and have a glass of wine, or something stronger, every day.  It does not make me sleepy (I was afraid of that happening at work), but it does help me sleep better through the night.  I'm now hoping that this, in addition to some other things I'm taking, will help with my hair loss.

review/summary: It's Okay
review/text: I wanted a product that was easier to travel overseas than with a ton of equal packets so bought this 6 pack of tablets.  They don't come out of their packaging very well and many times they are broken.  It is still not too bad when you consider that each tablet is half the strength of a regular equal packet so while overseas I can play around a little more to get the sugar taste just right.  Would I order it again?  Not sure but for now 6 packs will last quite some time and it is easier to use overseas.  Many European countries do offer sugar free alternatives but I am partial to the taste of equal so I am willing to put up with a little hassle to make it work - especially since European coffees are smaller in size so dealing with a smaller sugar content is okay.

Even at home they are convenient for me because he no longer leaves littly blue papers or a powdery mess for me to clean.  I also like  Amazon's easy reorder policy as we have difficulty finding Equal tablet packs locally.  All I had to do was compute how many tablets he uses, then choose how many and how often to order.  Now, if he would just drink his coffee black, like I do....

review/text: My local grocery store had stopped carrying these so I was happy to find them available on Amazon. Even with the shipping they were 40% cheaper than the store. However, I noticed that the package is slightly different and saw they were manufactured in Argentina. Also, the invoice (but not the package) says, "Past best sell date EXP 6/2010."<br />But, so far as I can tell, there is no difference. At least they weren't from China!

review/text: Being a diabetic, I was looking for an artificial sweetener in a pill or liquid form.  Liquid isn't as precise and can be messy, so pills were what I really wanted, especially since the packet-form contains maltodextrin (which is also a type of sugar but not required to be classified as such).  These pills - and especially the auto-fill feature - are great!

review/summary: Takes quite a few to make my drinks sweet enough
review/text: I love Equal; it's my favorite sweetener.  I like it mixed with other sweeteners and have taken to carrying around sweeteners in my purse so I'll drink tea rather than diet soda.  I've been ordering a liquid sucralose (aka Splenda) called EZ Sweetz <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LECIDE">3 Packs 0.5 oz - Liquid Sweetener 450 Servings/Bottle</a> but it's a bit pricey.  This is no real bargain though:  It seems like I need about five of the tablets to sweeten a glass of tea. I like it well enough, and it dissolves easily, but I ordered the drops because I don't like putting even more "extras" in my drink than I have to.  So, probably will continue to order my EZ Sweetz drops and won't reorder this next time.  In summary:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Tastes great<br />Reasonable price<br />Dissolves easily<br /><br />Cons:<br />Takes a handful to sweeten a large glass of tea

review/summary: Convenient, but not the answer.
review/text: A 'pump' of this creamer is 8 ml, and is 40 calories of concentrated sweetness. Two to three 'pumps' are needed for color and flavor (and I'm one to tell the latte stand to use less syrup in my coffee drinks.) You can store the product at room temp, but directions are to discard after 30 days. There is an aftertaste - slightly bitter with this creamer that's off-putting. I might purchase again, despite this, because of the convenience, if it weren't for the high 'cost' of calories. I'm going back to fat free half-and-half in the fridge.

review/text: To start off, everyone that has tasted this here in my office prefers the taste of the powder and not the liquid. I have to agree with that.<br /><br />About the pumps. One stopped working before I even got half way done with it. So I swapped it with the other pump (intended for the 2nd container). The 2nd pump also stopped working about a week after it was replaced. Now I have one container that has half still remaining and the other container isn't even open and both remain pumpless. At 1st I thought it was just one faulty pump... but BOTH? Come on. Ok product as far as taste, but horrible pump design. I'm sticking to the powder.

review/text: As an Aussie who became addicted to flavoured coffee creamer over several visits to the USA, this product is a godsend (it simply isn't available anywhere here).  I have found no problem with it's freshness deteriorating once opened (although a bottle doesn't last the recommended 30 days before discarding). Admittedly, I haven't tested it with an Australian summer yet.  Like some other reviewers, I do have two pumps per cup of coffee - but then, when using the refrigerated creamers, I always had a fairly generous splash, so this may just be my personal preference.

The refigerated ones usually don't get used up and I have to throw some away and I hate to waste.

But, that is not enough to make me quit buying it.<br /><br />I forgot that I could edit my review or I would have been back awhile ago.  These are only good for awhile.  After a period of time the pump stops working and I found that I had to cut the bottle open in order to be able to get a spoon in to use the last 1/4 of the bottle as it is was thick to pour.

As a result, we go through a lot of cream, sugar, flavoring, etc. We like to have a lot on hand so we never get bored!<br /><br />This economy size pump is perfect for me, since I never get tired of Hazelnut! I add a splash or two of this to almost every concoction. My favorite hazelnut feast? Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cup, brewed extra hot, with a heaping tablespoon of Nutella stirred in until dissolved and then 3 pumps of Coffee-Mate Hazelnut added. A quick froth with the hand frother and I am ready to cozy up with some homemade dark chocolate Biscotti and a good book for some 'Me Time'. *sigh* Heaven!

review/summary: Ok flavor, poor pump design
review/text: I've tried both Coffee-Mate creamer pumps in both Hazelnut and French Vanilla varieties. We use them for convenience at our office as well as at my church. The creamer itself is approximately equivalent to what you get in the individual flavored cups you find at gas stations and some restaurants. It's nowhere near as good as the fresh stuff you get at your grocery store. Each pump is supposed to be equal to one mini-tub but I don't think it is quite as potent personally.<br /><br />The main issue with these pumps aside from a compromise on taste is the poor quality of the pumps themselves. They frequently fail while the canister still has several inches of creamer still in it. Because of the nature of condensed creamer (thick and sticky) using the last 15-20% of the tub becomes tedious and messy. You either have to waste some of the creamer or sacrifice the convenience of of the pump--which is the main selling point to begin with.<br /><br />We still use these pumps because there is no readily available alternative, but for my personal coffee I stay away from them and go for fresh creamer whenever possible.

review/summary: India's Original Spiced Milk Tea.
review/text: In many languages around the world, "chai" simply means "tea." In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea.<br /><br />Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region, although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea, rich milk, various spices and a sweetner. The spices most commonly used are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper; Tazo's very peppery Chai adds rooibos, vanilla, star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe.<br /><br />You should always have this tea with real sugar, even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener, because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. And if you like your store-bought Chai, maybe you'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices, too! Namaste ...

review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as "cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice" and "medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.<br /><br />The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Chai gets only four stars.<br />****

review/summary: Beware of Meltdown
review/text: I love these cookies (or biscuits, if you prefer)!  They are the perfect after-work snack with a glass of milk. One or two takes the edge off my hunger and tides me over until mealtime.  The packaging in my experience was great. They were very secure with no breakage.  Unfortunately, the chocolate layer had melted and when they cooled the cookies stuck together.  Of course, this was probably due to them being left out on top of my mail box for a couple of hours before I arrived home to retrieve them.  The next time I'll either arrange to be home when they arrive or have them shipped to my place of work.  Other than that, great experience!  And they've started selling them at my local grocery store, but I'm glad to know I have a backup source since the store did stop carrying my beloved Biscoffs :(

review/summary: What's Not To Love
review/text: These are all natural, gluten free, low in fat and calories (130 calories and 3 grams of fat per serving) and they taste great.  Simply put I love everything about these chips.  The only problem with them is that they're definitely addicting and I want to eat them all the time.  I guess it's a good thing they're such a good deal here on Amazon (much cheaper than at my local grocery store).<br /><br />The texture is somewhat similar to a rice cake, except that it's much thinner so it has a better crunch to it.  They taste like salted popcorn minus the annoying hulls and un-popped kernels.

review/summary: Get real salty, real fast...
review/text: We discovered these when my husband bought a bag of the Sea Salt flavor at a convenience store. I loved them so I came to Amazon to get a case. This Butter flavor was a few dollars less than the other flavors so I got it.<br />The flavor is divine at first, but I can only eat about 5 chips before my mouth shrivels up from the overpowering saltiness. I did not experience that when eating the Sea Salt flavor.<br />I will probably order PopCorners again, but DEFINITELY NOT the Butter variety. I will stick with the Sea Salt kind.

review/summary: Great Low-Fat Snack
review/text: I love chips but don't love all the fat and calories they have.  These are a great alternative.  One serving (one ounce) has 120 calories and 3.5 grams of fat.  These taste great and have a nice satisfying crunch just like chips do but are much better for me.  My only complaint is that the butter flavor sometimes leaves a funny aftertaste in my mouth.  I've also tried the sea salt flavor and the white cheddar flavor.  Neither of those leave an aftertaste.  My favorite is the white cheddar flavor.

review/text: gee, delta gave me biscoff and now you give me popcorners! getting culture in the clouds. how could you go wrong with cheesy-jalapeno. c'mon now. The texture can be compared to how hand tossed and thin crust pizza are the same. Its a thinner rice cake meets a pita chip. Could have a stronger flavor but I'm just that kind of girl. 4 stars on the muchy rating scale. Feels like you get more in a bag than you would potato chips. Plus they "feel" healthier, which definitely helps when youre slinging back airline bloody marys. Came in a huge box of many but don't threaten me with a good time, They are being whittled down as we speak. Only shame is you can't buy a variety box. Ah well, *munch munch munch*

review/summary: My new favorite!
review/text: I've tried all the Popcorner flavors, and for a while I was completely addicted to the cheddar ones, but now the Sea Salt ones are my absolute favorites.<br /><br />They taste very similar to tortilla chips or baked corn chips- but with a slightly airy texture. And the salt is divine- I LOVE salty things, so the extra sprinkle of salt is much appreciated. These are light, airy, healthy snacks that pack the same punch as a treat that wouldn't be as kind to your body. They truly satisfy a craving for crispy and salty snacks without making you feel as if you liked a giant crystal of salt and scorched your mouth (the drawback to eating Fritos...)<br /><br />Here's a tip though- since the salt isn't baked into the chip or coated on with oils, it's best to REALLY shake the bag of Popcorners before eating- that way all the salt that had settled on the bottom of the bag get sprinkled back on the chips.<br /><br />Great everyday treat that satisfies and doesn't make you feel parched and guilty for indulging. My whole family loves them.

I absolutly love the cheesy jalapeno flavour, spicy but not over bearing... I serve it at my friendly "get-togethers" but everyone wants a bag to go. of course I tell them they better go on amaie and order their own... (now i hide the box in my bedroom ;)

review/summary: You really can't eat just one bag!
review/text: This product has been waited for, I can personally say all my life. I love popcorn, but hate the things that usually come with it. It always gets stuck in the teeth or in the back of your throat. Not with Pop Corners, here you can eat and eat and never have anything get stuck or choke you. I love it, and I wish I could keep buying it. Sea Salt is my all time favorite and I try to get it as much as I possible can afford it. Buying by the case made it great, having as much as I want, when I want it, but it can get a bit expensive. But when the time is right I will be buying more to enjoy. If I could scream this out my window, I would scream for everyone to buy Pop corners.

I love that they only have 3 ingredients.  They're similar to rice cakes only thinner, and have achip-like crisp/crunch.  I was surprised to find the size of the bags, assuming they were small bags.  The 5 ounce bag is almost the size of regular chip bags, not individual bags.

review/summary: The only problem is, after the first bite, you cannot stop.
review/text: I'm never a fan of popcorn. Hate the chewiness, grease and the sugary flavors. But this bag of Popcorners is no typical popcorn. First of all, I purchased it on line, attracted by the packaging of course (one really eat with the eyes!), which jumps out of the usual bright pink or yellow colors you see when it comes to popcorns. Also thinking it might be just an alternation of "baked chips," already quite popular in the market. Even after I received it, I still thought "The wrapping's really lovely. But I'm just gonna try out a bite...".<br /><br />The only problem was, I couldn't stop after the first bite. Who knew something so simple, with only three ingredients for this flavor, could be this sensational? It's crispy yet thick in the texture. The size of each piece is not too big nor too small. The natural scent of corn is just delightful to the palate. Don't need to lick the fingers....I'm completely amazed and will be venturing into the other flavors. This is one snack food I'd be munching out. Ditch the bags of chips at lunch, try this!

review/text: Like quite a few other reviews, I discovered these on a JetBlue flight. I did try to find them when I landed too. But, it's really not so easy. I did find them when I got home though and have been eating them ever since. The Sea Salt are my favorite by far. I was lucky enough to get that flavor on the flight. If it had been one of the others, I may have never eaten them again. I've tried the Butter (way too salty) and Kettle (too sweet). So, I went back to Sea Salt and stayed there. My favorite thing about them is there are only 3 ingredients all of which you can pronounce.

review/text: Popcorner chips taste great, but don't be fooled by the "low calorie" bit.  They are low in fat compared to regular potato chips, but the calories are fairly close.  For example, the calorie count for 1oz of Popcorners is about 120.  The calorie count for 1oz of Kettle Chips is 150.<br /><br />That being said, if you aren't thinking you're eating them for health reasons, they're great and tasty as a snack!

review/summary: Popcorn lovers -- you really should try this
review/text: I love popcorn but after trying these, I don't know if I should ever bother popping corn again.  The taste of these is wonderful and I really like the crunchiness of the chip.  Best of all, however, one can have them anytime by simply opening a bag.  While popcorn can be popped, stored and eaten later, good as it is, it is never quite as good as it is freshly-popped.  These taste great however, and I would rank them very close to freshly popped popcorn -- add convenience and crunch and they pull ahead in my eyes.<br />Note that I am really basing my comparison on the Kettlecorn variety so I, perhaps, shouldn't be comparing it to plain popcorn, but I would rate this against regular kettlecorn similarly, and I suspect that the regular popcorn varieties would hold their own.<br /><br />The additional sugar in the Kettlecorn version weighs in at only 3g in a one-ounce serving so despite the great taste, it isn't exactly drenched in sugar.  If you love Kettlecorn or popcorn, you should give PopCorners a try.

review/text: It does taste pretty coffee-like. Not like the freshly brewed kind of coffee, but like the instant type. I really like the nice foam that forms on top when you add hot water (see photo). It's so easy to prepare: the instructions say to just scoop a well rounded teaspoon into a mug, add hot water and sweetener if you want and you're good to go. I actually prefer two well rounded teaspoons, but that's just a matter of taste. It smells good, it tastes good, and it's not too thin and watery like a tea. It does not taste like a perfect cup of freshly brewed coffee made with freshly ground beans, but it is a nice alternative if you can't have caffeine.

review/text: I absolutely love this sauce. It is rather mild and not full of heat, but it is full of flavor. I'd almost call it somewhat sweet. It has a tomato base and contains several popular Indian spices. It is also vegan and gluten-free. I usually cook with this as follows: saute chopped onion and bell pepper in oil, add the sauce and simmer for a couple of minutes, add protein (I use baked tofu), and serve over buckwheat noodles.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer about the price though. I can usually find it for four dollars or less per jar at my local grocer.

When you add on the shipping, the cost per jar is outrageous. If you find it locally, buy some!

review/summary: Jarred Sauce Surprisingly Good
review/text: I need to stop being lazy and make my own Jalfrezi... its not that difficult.  That said, until I do, I am sticking with the Seeds of Change brand Jalfrezi sauce.  I've tasted others (like Tastes of India) and they are not as good.  Not sure why since the ingredients are practically the same (?).<br /><br />This is a mild version of jalfrezi; i've read that normally jalfrezi is a bit on the hot spicy side, but this mild version is wonderful.  Very easy, tasty, Indian sauce for simmering with just about any type of main dish one can think of.  I love it.

review/summary: Mild but Sophisticated
review/text: This mild, complex simmer sauce goes especially well with chicken, though I also recommend it with lamb.  The clear and unadulterated taste of bell peppers  is like taking a deep breath in somebody's beloved vegetable garden.  Despite its sophisticated use of spices, the flavor is mild enough for newcomers unaccustomed to Indian food.  I wish it had a little more onion to it, just to bring out the nuances of the meat, but I have no trepidation about recommending this sauce to anybody who enjoys Indian food.

review/summary: A little bit of chocolate heaven ...
review/text: Wow!  As an unrepentant chocoholic, I'm always looking for great yummy chocolate treats.  Unfortunately, there IS a downside: too much of a good thing can lead to less than desirable results, especially on the scale.<br /><br />Soooo ... I try to moderate my chocolate consumption, exercising portion control, etc.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of Warm Delights since they were introduced - they're VERY good and easy to prepare -- but they're rather high in calories (and Weight Watchers points).<br /><br />These new Minis are the perfect solution:  150 calories (or 3 Weight Watchers points).  I fix one of these, and top it with a small scoop of low-fat frozen yogurt -- heaven!  They're just the right size to give me my chocolate "fix."<br /><br />The price here is excellent, too.

review/summary: Diet Saver!!  Perfect Size Dessert!
review/text: A friend introduced me to these about 6 months ago, and they have become a staple ever since. My weakness is dessert. I can stick to my diet all day long, but in the evening I MUST have some type of baked, preferably chocolate, dessert. I was having a very hard time finding something to fit the bill, satisfy my sweet tooth and still stay on track - sorry those 100 cal cookie packs were not cutting it lol. I had feared that these would taste 'fake', but surprisingly they are very yummy! They are so much better and easier than the "No Pudge" mix. Completely hit the spot, leaving me satisfied, especially during that time of the month.  Personally, I don't always mix in the accompanying "flavor pack", so you can also have plain chocolate flavor when you prefer by just omitting it (although the flavor pack taste is not overwhelming). I like to add fresh strawberries and some ff/sf cool whip for a real decadent low calorie treat. Couple tablespoons of water, and 35 seconds in the micro and voila!<br />I am so happy Amazon finally started carrying these. When I can find them, I usually pay $2.49-$2.99 each a pack. These work out a tad cheaper. I have also tried the larger sized ones and believe it or not, they are a little too rich and 3 quarters the way through I got that "ate too much/sick" feeling. I definitely appreciate these for the single serving size - makes my cheating guilt free.

review/summary: Nice Tasty Treat For Us Dieters
review/text: It was a little bit like eating a cupcake, but the great thing about it was there was no cleanup, and it was ready in the microwave it 30 seconds.  If you order it, don't expect a huge chunk of cake, but it's a very nice dessert treat for 150 calories if you are on a diet, and like chocolate.  Seems like a pretty good price and fast delivery with Amazon's subscribe and save plan.  Don't expect to feel stuffed, but expect a pretty nice treat for yourself.

review/summary: Crystal Pepsi is back, with an unfortunate name.
review/text: Good luck finding this in stores, as people will find it's whimsical name in bad taste. But if you loved the taste of Crystal Pepsi back in the early 90s, then the inside is the only thing that matters.

review/summary: Great Taste, Terrible Name.
review/text: Like the others have stated, it does indeed taste like Crystal Pepsi.  For those who never had Crystal Pepsi, it's basically like regular Pepsi except lighter and a bit sweeter.  The play-on-words name is the worst I've seen.  But taste is what matters, and this tastes great.
