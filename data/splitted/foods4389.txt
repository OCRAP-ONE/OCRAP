review/summary: You call that salmon?  Really?  Rancid dried fruit killed it as well!
review/text: I read a really bad review of this but I'm trying all the GoPicnic meals so I tried it anyway.  There were more bad items than good in this, unfortunately.  The salmon was like a weird tasting, overly-fishy, lumpy soup. Gross! (And I love salmon in many shapes and forms!) I couldn't finish it and gave the majority to my dog.  Since that's the main value of the meal (protein) I found this GoPicnic meal to be of no value to me!  Anyway..The crackers were excellent (same ones as in a few other meals), the edamame was okay but bland (google the dangers of eating soybean for women...made me wary of eating this) and the dry fruit mix was rancid!  I double-checked the expiration date to make sure I didn't get a bad lot but it doesn't expire for several months.  I'm writing Amazon for a refund after my review.  It's too bad...I enjoyed the majority of the meals.

review/summary: Terrible Taste
review/text: So after reading all the reviews I had really high hopes for this meal. To my shock and true disappointment this meal was terrible. The salmon tasted like vomit and the crackers were flavorless. The Edamame were very dry and tasted like raw black eyed peas. The only decent thing in the meal was the fruit and nut mix which I mixed with Edamame to make those edible. I'm in Afghan and was looking for a healthy quick lunch. What I got was an overpriced disappointment. The chocolate wasn't even very good.

review/summary: Another Airline Meal Option
review/text: Those who think I'm kidding obviously haven't flown Coach in a while, and while you can usually purchase a somewhat similar snack/meal from your airline during the flight, it will almost certainly cost a lot more.<br /><br />Theoretically even cheaper would be assembling this snack/meal yourself because GoPicnic is for the most part simply repackaging food products manufactured by others, but of course in that case you will have to do all of the work!<br /><br />The first item I tried was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G2UUOS">Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame, Lightly Salted,</a> 1 oz., which I found palatable but extremely dry.<br /><br />One of the two exclusively GoPicnic distributed items in the meal box was the Chili Lime Salmon Spread, 1.6 oz., which I found quite delicious.  I ate it with the enclosed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CFJDWY">Late July Organic Classic Rich Crackers</a>, 0.7 oz., but in fairness I think it would have tasted just as good on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013A1WGC">Ritz Crackers</a>.  (I'm unsure why a Dispoz-o Senate White Medium Weight Polypropylene Fork was included rather than the Dispoz-o Senate White Medium Weight Polypropylene Knife that would have been more useful.)<br /><br />The other exclusively GoPicnic distributed item, the Ginger Zip all natural fruit & nut mix 0.75 oz bag, wasn't bad.<br /><br />Finally, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LL9OA6">Terra Nostra Organics Robust 60% Chocolate Mini Square, 0.43 oz.</a> made a tasty little dessert.<br /><br />Note: The meal box also has a Sudoku puzzle in the bottom.<br /><br />Now it is up to you.  You can buy this one, assemble your own, or try one of the other GoPicnic Care Packages or Ready-To-Eat Meals.

review/summary: Terrible Value
review/text: My relationship to food is very much a balance between cost and taste -- I'm willing to pay for pricey food that's amazing, but I have a very keen internal sense of what's "worth" it and what isn't. This box of snacks ain't worth it. First of all it's only a meal for folks who tend to eat smallish meals. Yes, it has 410 calories, but I would guess most of that is the chocolate and trail mix. There's not enough bulk here to constitute what I would call a meal, and unfortunately, the "main dish" is awful. The box contains:<br /><br />A 1-oz. package of roasted and lightly salted edamame, which I actually liked, but I suspect most people will hate. It's got a very subtle flavor that most people I know hate.<br /><br />A .75-oz. package of fruit/nut/ginger trail mix. I like trail mix, this struck me as a bit sweet and the two handfulls don't last long.<br /><br />A 1.6-oz. packet of "chili lime salmon spread" to have with 6 small circular crackers. The crackers are totally fine (hard to screw up a cracker), but the salmon spread is awful. I love salmon, I love chili lime concotions, I love seafood spreads. This was nauseatingly bad, way too fishy and the red pepper base totally overwhelms the chili lime flavor. This part of the package needs a completely new recipe. (And why is this packaged with a plastic fork? It's a spread, it needs a knife!)<br /><br />A .4-oz. square of dark chocolate. This was quite good and just the right size.<br /><br />So, a pretty mediocre bundle of organic snacks at an outrageous price makes this a terrible value.

review/summary: Go Picnic Snack Pack with Chili Lime Salmon Spread Main Course
review/text: GoPicnic's Ready to Eat Meals with Salmon and Crackers was an interesting array of mostly healthy foodstuffs.  The whole shebang comes in a cardboard box that opens like a laptop and can presumably be closed again (I ate everything and so didn't close it).  There's even a sudoku puzzle on the inside(of mine at least). Also inside are individually wrapped containers of Late July brand rich crackers, Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame with salt, Gopicnic's Chili Lime Salmon spread, Gopicnic's Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix, and a Terra Nostra's organic robust dark chocolate square.  These items are all shelf stable for several months as long as kept in a cool dry place (meaning that you probably shouldn't store these in your car in the summertime for more than a few hours).<br /><br />I have a love hate relationship with salmon.  Either I love it (usually in the form of spreads and cakes) or I hate it (grilled, broiled, pan fried filets) so I expected to love this version.  Surprisingly, I'm kind of on the fence about this very orange appearing spread.  It has a nice salmon flavor (and large flakes of fish in the mix) that is just slightly fishy and you can taste the lime, but to me the chili was really lacking.  I think with more of a chili note in the spread I would have enjoyed it much more. 3 Stars for this product.<br /><br />Salmon Spread Ingredients:Alaskan pink salmon, water, red pepper paste, sugar, lime juice, modified cornstarch, salt, vinegar, garlic powder, chili powder, spices (no MSG), natural lime flavor, maltodextrin, and natural color.  The salmon comes from a MSC certified fishery.<br /><br />The Late July Crackers (which I have had before) are always delicious and remind me much of a flaky butter type cracker.  The salmon spread went well on them and they weren't brittle enough to break when the spread was applied.  The utensil given for this purpose was a fork. 6 Crackers come in a pack and I found that I had a little more salmon than cracker (although I didn't go crazy with the application. 5 Stars for this product.<br /><br />Cracker Ingredients: Organic Wheat flour, organic evaporated cane juice, organic oleic safflower oil and/or organic oleic sunflower oil, organic palm oil, sea salt, leavening, soy lecithin, enzymes.<br /><br />I didn't really like the Dry Roasted Edamame.  The only taste at all that I got from them was the bare hint of salt added.  I think with all the other flavor packed items in this picnic a seasoned variety could have better competed with everything.  Otherwise it was somewhat bland and I had no desire to finish the small packet. 1 Star for this product<br /><br />Edamame Ingredients:Soybeans, Sea Salt<br /><br />I think my favorite item in this packet would be the Ginger Zip fruit mix.  It was tasty, but not too sweet, with just the lightest touch of ginger that I thought was perfect and didn't overpower the natural flavors of the dried fruit and peanut mixture.  Sadly, it was only a .75 oz packet and I ran out before I wanted to.  I would gladly have traded the edamame for a bigger packet of this snack. 5 Stars for this product<br /><br />Mix Ingredients:Ginger peanuts, (sugar, ground ginger, sea salt), cranberries, banana chips.<br /><br />Last but not least is the dark chocolate square.  I'm a big fan of dark chocolate and since this was 60% cacao it suited me just fine.  It had just a hint of sweetness with that wonderful bitterness you can only get from darker chocolates. 4 Stars for this product.<br /><br />Chocolate Ingredients:Organic dark chocolate, dry cocoa solids.<br /><br />Allergies: On all items the packaging warns for Soy, Milk, Wheat, Peanuts, Fish, and Treenuts.<br /><br />Overall I'd have to say that this was a pretty good snack that I could see myself taking to work or on a car trip with me. I'd prefer that a couple of the ingredients would change but it still filled me up despite my avoidance of some items, but didn't over fill me to the point where I felt sleepy after lunch.<br /><br />Review by M.

review/summary: Tasty Gluten-Free Meal on the Go!
review/text: I have been searching for healthy, quick, pre-packaged gluten-free meals... I was so excited to find these! I tried the salmon meal today and really liked it all - it was SO EASY, and much less expensive than most gluten-free foods!<br /><br />Since the packaging doesn't scream "gluten free" (and is more attractive than most store-bought packaged lunches), I plan to purchase some of the more kid-friendly flavors for the gluten-free elementary girl I sponsor. She will actually be able to eat a "fancy" packed lunch with her friends!<br /><br />Now I'm off to order some other flavors...

review/summary: A tasty shelf stable mini-feast
review/text: I must say that this is quite good.  I try to keep shelf stable food handy to grab if I want to have a picnic or to take to something like fireworks, or even a quick lunch.  Normally that means something pretty boring and probably non-meat.  In the past I have tried everything, including MRE peanut butter packets.  Let me tell you, this surely beats MREs by a wide margin for taste.<br /><br />When i say mini-feast, I perhaps should say micro I do have to admit that the portions aren't exactly large, but since I am on a diet this is a great option that brings some welcome variety to the table.

review/summary: Satisfactory as a light meal or heavy snack
review/text: Sometimes I just want to be able to grab something to eat that doesn't require refrigeration or cooking and go. Unfortunately most things that fit these requirements are full of unpronounceable ingredients. This pack by GoPicnic is better than most options as the ingredients are recognizable. The calories are reasonable as well.<br /><br />As for taste, I liked everything but the dry roasted edamame, which was bland. The crackers, chocolate, and trail mix were all delicious and the salmon complemented the crackers nicely.<br /><br />Although I wouldn't eat these regularly for lunch, they would be great as meals while traveling.

review/summary: Well
review/text: It's a really good idea,  I swear... Just not really for me.  I didn't enjoy the taste of the salmon,  nor did my mother or my brother. (in fact he kept asking me why I'm eating it and doing that to myself,  ha).  Some people seem to put great reviews and love this,  its just ot for me.  The edamame tasted kind of stale to me,  but I'm sure thats the way dry edamame tastes.  The Ginger fruit pack,  My brother said tasted like perfume,  I think it tasted fine,  except the Ginger did resemble the taste of perfume.  The crackers were good,  As was the chocolate.<br />Over all,  I wouldn't get this again,  it's just ot for me.  I would prefer to be healthy in different ways.

review/text: This was a fun little snack/working lunch. I loved that it had a variety of items - snack sized portions of five different things. For some reason I think that's more satisfying than just having a lot of one or two things. And the best part... there's a sudoku puzzle inside the box! Altogether a well-thought out package of goodies.

review/summary: Neat little snackbox
review/text: Every packet was easy to open and neatly arranged.<br />The salmon spread was less chunky than I expected but it was tasty and was a tiny bit spicy. Comes with a fork so it's spreadable.  The crackers were good..I loved the snack mix which had bananas, cranberries and ginger-coated peanuts.  Not too sweet and tasty..<br />I am sure I have had soy nuts before although not my usual fare...I couldn't eat these as there was no salt that I could taste on them..they were awful in my opinion, and maybe salt wouldn't have helped them.  The dark chocolate was great and not bitter.<br /><br />This would've been a good snack box for my teenage daughter without the soy nuts.  She eats like a bird..and there is not much in this tiny box, but I feel the ingredients were good quality.  Just depends on how much it takes to fill you up.

review/summary: A backpacker's delight
review/text: I ate this for dinner and am very surprised that I actually liked it. You get 22 grams of protein, 11 grams of fiber and 410 calories of energy in a box that converts into a very thin lunch box complete with a Sudoku puzzle.<br /><br />The box contains:<br />- chili lime salmon spread the consistency of cat or baby food (my least liked food item) but still eatable<br />- organic crackers similar to Ritz crackers but not as buttery<br />- a nicely flavored Ginger Zip dried fruit and nut mix<br />- a package of dry roasted edamame that was very, very, dry but which I actually liked (you'll need a lot of water to wash this down)<br />- a tasty morsel of organic 60% dark chocolate - the chocolate was covered in a white haze (which means it was "blooming" but was still edible)<br />- a plastic fork for the salmon spread<br />- a Sudoku puzzle in the base of the box<br />- a fun food fact (similar to the trivia you find on a Snapple bottle cap)<br /><br />The major element I didn't like was that this meal is very high in salt (660mg or 28% of your Daily Value).  Also, since the edamame is very dry, you really need to bring lots of water to wash it down.<br /><br />I think this is a good meal to grab if you are backpacking for a day or if you don't want to carry perishables on you during a long drive.  However, I wouldn't consider this healthy fare for an everyday lunch. Overall, I really liked the taste and was pleasantly surprised that I ate every morsel in the box--I didn't even share my salmon spread with the cats and that was my least favorite item.<br /><br />I never thought I'd say this since I usually called boxed food unnatural food-like substances, but GoPicnic gets 4 stars from me!

review/summary: Surprisingly Delicious
review/text: When I saw the size of this "picnic in a box" (only 4.4 ounces), I didn't expect much. Was surprised at how good everything tasted and how filling and satisfying it was.  For a child who doesn't eat much, this might be a perfect meal on a picnic.  While I wouldn't call it an adult meal, it's a great snack.  The dry roasted edamame was crunchy and delicious, but a bit on the dry side.  Not quite as tasty as peanuts, but a lot healthier.  The Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix was really good; wish there had been more of it.  The main course is crackers with Chili Lime Salmon Spread, which was adequate, but nothing special.  A child might not like it because of the slight spiciness.  For dessert, there is a nice and very good tasting dark chocolate square.  Except for the sodium, which was a little higher than I would have liked (660mg), this seems pretty healthy (no trans fats, no high fructose corn syrup, no MSG.)  The real beauty of these little picnics is that they are not perishable, are very compact to carry and come in a convenient box that you can re-close if you don't eat everything at one time.  I would stock a few of these up as emergency provisions, as they are nutritious and tasty, probably have a long shelf life and you won't go hungry in an emergency when you have no power to cook anything.  Great idea, but a slightly larger version might be better.  They are worth trying.  Seems like a good meal for diabetics who are supposed to eat frequently for their meal or snack in between the main meals of the day.

review/summary: this is really tasty!
review/text: I wasn't completely sure what to expect from this product, but thought it would be good for a trip to the beach or quick snack at the park.  I was very pleasantly surprised by what is in these 6 really tiny looking boxes.  The salmon actually tasted like fresh fish, with a creamy texture, which was put on  "ritz" like, flavorful crackers. They were pretty filling.  Also included were a bag of edamame and one of dried fruit, both a nice treat, and a piece of yummy dark chocolate.  I think that if you really wanted a full picnic  meal, you might want to add some vegetable sticks or a piece of fruit.  But it occurs to me that a great use would be on an airplane flight that does not provide a meal, as is the case more and more often, and we plan to take a few on our next trip.  There are several GoPicnic varieties and based on this item, we are going to try a few more.

review/summary: Mix-match of good and not so good
review/text: According to the packaging this product contains a balanced meal with 22g of protein, 11g of fiber and 410 calories. Inside you find a chili lime salmon spread, organic crackers, a fruit/nut mix, dry roasted edamame, and an organic piece of dark chocolate. Some of it was very good, while others are not-so-good. There's not a lot of food here, I'd consider it a meal if you're a person who eats multiple small meals 4-5 times daily rather than 2-3 larger meals; it's more along the line of a snack if you're a person with a hearty appetite.<br /><br />I'd definitely buy the Late July organic classic rich crackers again, they were light and buttery while maintaining their crispness; much nicer than Ritz crackers. The Sweet Perry Orchards ginger zip fruit& nut mix was surprisingly good. I'm generally not a big fan of ginger, but there was a nice contrast between the flavors and textures - would probably buy separately. The Seapoint Farms dry roasted edamame was ok. Admittedly, it was my first time trying edamame, and the general consensus between my group was that it tasted 'green' or 'like sunflower seeds, only not as good'. I probably won't go out of my way to search for this product in the future, but it's all right. The Terra Nostra organic robust dark chocolate square got rave reviews, with people eagerly looking for more. It's a good sized piece, large enough for that chocolate rush, but not so big you'll regret it later. The chili lime salmon spread was a bit of a bust. It was definitely salmon, but I didn't enjoy the addition of the chili lime flavor. It was filling as a snack, but honestly, I'd probably pick a tuna option in the future.<br /><br />Overall, I'd be more inclined to purchase the items I liked separately than purchase this kit again. I think I could make my own version at home for a more cost effective price, but if you're a person who enjoys convenience and variety, this may suit you fine.

review/summary: Tons of food
review/text: There is a LOT of food in this little box.  Each item is individually sealed to maintain freshness.  For lunch I had 6 round crackers with a topping of Chili Lime Salmon Spread (1.6oz of spread) which was delicious.  I followed this with a serving of lightly salted dry roasted edamame, Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix, and a square of dark chocolate.  By the time I was done I felt comfortably full.<br /><br />The Ginger Zip mix was delightfully flavored by ginger, however there was more sugar in it than I would prefer.  The mix consists of ginger peanuts, cranberries and banana chips and each of the individual items had sugar added.  (Ginger peanuts contain sugar, ground ginger, sea salt; cranberries consist of cranberries & sugar, and the banana chips contain coconut oil, sugar, natural flavors).  The crackers are a Ritz-type white cracker made by a company called Late July, and which are described as Organic, classic rich, flaky buttery tasting crackers.  Looking at the ingredients list they do contain all organic components and do NOT contain corn syrup, which is certainly a plus.  And, I would have to say their description is accurate - they were flaky, buttery and quite delicious.  They would be even better if they were whole wheat though.  Just sayin'....<br /><br />Overall though, these get a big thumbs up.  My family spends a lot of time attending various sporting events for the kids and a box of food like this is awesome to throw in to provide an on-the-go meal so that we are not stuck buying bad food at exorbitant prices at concession stands, or snacking on a lot of junk.

review/summary: The price is right, the taste is great!
review/text: This is a nice flat little portable snackbox that you can tuck into a purse or briefcase, knapsack, large fanny pack, luggage, picnic basket - desk drawer, whatever. It's convenient and there for you when you are on-the-go, a mid morning break, your lunch, a survival package, a camping/hiking energy booster or meal.<br /><br />First, let's get this out of the way:<br />Two things it needs, and didn't have-<br />1- a plastic knife. The fork is not necessary -- at all. The knife - even one without serrations -- would be useful for spreading the salmon on the crackers, and scraping the inside of the plastic container to get all the tasty goodness left on the inner sides of the container.<br />2- a hand wipe. Most of this is finger food -- or slightly oily (the salmon) and a disposable moist wipe would be great.<br /><br />The box is well-made and has a tab you can close if you don't eat everything at the same meal. It has a cool Soduko puzzle inside, and is a great place to put all the leftover empty packs to take with you until you are ready to dispose of them/recycle them.<br /><br />Now, onto the comestibles.<br />First, the Chili-Lime salmon spread is great! Not too spicy -- nice and lime-tangy, and a good mouthful for the size of the package it comes in. I'm not much of a spice-eater but I thought this was a very good combination of flavors with just the right amount of spiciness. The crackers are organic, and even by themselves taste very good. Because there was no knife in the box, I used the crackers to shovel out the salmon spread -- they held up very well -- none of them broke. They were a good accompaniment for the spread - it tasted great on the crackers or by itself.<br /><br />The Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix was Awesome! Ginger peanuts, banana chips (some of the banana chips were very hard-- not a good surprise for someone in-between dental work), cranberries -- enjoyably sweet and ginger-y. And ginger is also a great digestive aid.<br /><br />The dry-roasted Edemame was surprisingly good-- at first I thought I was going to encounter hard Nuts -- but no -- they were nice and crunchy; tasty, with just the right amount of salt ("lightly salted"). The Edemame itself could qualify as a snack by itself -- a mini-meal.<br /><br />The chocolate reminded my of my days of Survival Chocolate Bars, because it was pretty hard, but it was delicious.<br /><br />Looking at the nutritional information on the side of the box, I see that this snack is low in calories (410) somewhat high in fat and sodium content, but it's also high in Protein and Carbs, which (to me) is great because these two are energy restorers and boosters.<br /><br />(PS- The front of the package needs to carry a sentence or two about the Nuts in the ingredients. Not everyone knows that Edemame are Soybeans, a possible allergen to those who have nut sensitivities. Those who are allergic to nuts need to know what they are getting.)

review/summary: Pricey but good
review/text: There was a lot of food in a small package here, which was a pleasant surprise, honestly.<br /><br />Now, as a disclaimer, I should mention I've eaten more than my bodyweight in MREs, so my standards for 'edible and delicious' in long-term-storage-food might be a bit low, but I actually really dug this.<br /><br />The salmon spread was zippy and spicy without being too much, and just enough for the 6 crackers.  The edamame are darker looking than you see in the boxart, and do have a bit of a beany aftertaste.  I wish there was a bit less of those and way more of that fruit mix--unlike regular 'dried fruit' this had a nice gingery seasoning that made it really outstanding. I could eat just that and be a happy little camper.<br /><br />And the chocolate square is nummy. :D<br /><br />The downsides, as others have mentioned, is that for that price, you can probably go get something fresh-cooked to eat, and there is a good bit of waste--each individual plastic wrapper and the box itself.  The plus sides are that it is portable, it's tasty and it's quite handy.<br /><br />Will I buy it again?  I think so, honestly. Sometimes I don't have time the night before to pack up a healthy lunch from home and in that case, this would be a great way to stave off the temptation of the dreaded vending machine or the temptation to call out for pizza.  Not an every-day item for me, but as an occasional treat, definitely!

review/summary: Lunchables for Big Kids
review/text: As a child, Lunchables held a great bit of wonder for me.  Too expensive to afford very frequently, but oh so awesome when we could.  I think it had something to do with the food being arranged in a certain way and the fun of putting it all together.  As an adult, I no longer feel that way about them or would even want to eat one, but some of that magic feeling came back as I opened the gopicnic box for the first time.  Everything is arranged in a snazzy way in little packages, and it comes with a plastic fork (I thought I would want a knife, but the fork worked better).  The box is also printed with some fun facts and includes a Sudoku puzzle, though I chose to eat on it to keep from making a mess.  Can I ditch work and go play?<br /><br />Okay, with that out of my system, I will talk about the food.  First, it was quickly apparent that this is geared toward health-conscious people.  No corn syrup, MSG, or trans-fats (the opposite of Lunchables!).  The salmon spread was my greatest fear, but it was actually yummy.  Not too fishy, and the lime flavor is subtle and not grossly artificial like it often is in other products.  The texture is typical spread -- thick enough to not make a mess at work when applying to the included 6 crackers.  Speaking of work, I don't think the smell is strong enough to offend those around you.<br /><br />Dry roasted edamame is included in a generous portion.  I found this tasty and you may even want to keep some to snack on over time.  The flavor is pretty neutral and not too salty.<br /><br />My favorite part was the Ginger Zip mix, which is ginger peanuts, cranberries, and banana chips.  The texture is not too hard or chewy and the amount of ginger is just right.  My only complaint is that there is not much of it!<br /><br />A block, which breaks into two pieces, of organic dark chocolate is included to finish the meal.  It is just the right amount to end on a high note without being overbearing, since this is lunch/snack and a brownie or something like that might leave me feeling gross.<br /><br />Overall, I love these!  Like Lunchables, I am afraid they cost a bit much to eat on a daily basis, but they make a nice treat for here and there when I'm feeling a bit down.  For me, a 410 calorie pack is a substantial lunch and I had trouble finishing it, but I also keep to a pretty strict diet in general.  You could always add more crackers if you want to stretch it, because there is enough spread for more.

review/summary: Convenient meal on the go
review/text: GoPicnic is a unique concept in portable foods.  Each lunch box has a individually packaged items:<br /><br />Ginger Zip Fruit and Nut Mix<br />Terra Nostra Organic Robust 60% Dark Chocolate bar<br />Seapoint Farms Lightly Salted Dry Roasted Edamame<br />Late July Organic Classic Rich Crackers<br />GoPicnic Chili Line Salmon Spread<br /><br />THE BREAKDOWN<br /><br />The Dry Roasted Edamme is dry roasted soybeans seasoned with sea salt.  They are a light crunchy, tasty snack.  The entire package is 130 calories with 4 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbohydrates (8 of which is dietary fiber) and 14 grams of protein.  Sodium is only 150 mg.<br /><br />Ginger zip is a trail mix of Ginger peanuts, cranberries and banana chips.  The ginger undertones is subtle and not overpowering. The package is 90 calories with 40 mg of sodium, 2 grams of protein, 13 grams of carbohydrates, and 40 calories of fat (majority of which is unsaturated fat).<br /><br />The crackers and salmon dip combination is very good.  The dip tastes of mild chili with salmon and light citrus undertones.  The crackers are cripsy and lightly salted.  The combination of textures and flavors is just right.  However, I also put a few Edamame on top of the combination that made the combination a lot more enjoyable.<br /><br />The dark chocolate is aromatic, creamy and bittersweet.  I usually favor higher percentage of cocoa but this is an excellent finish to the Salmon Dip.<br /><br />The box is made of 100% recycled materials.  Inside the box there is a Sudoku puzzle.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />I don't consider this particular product a full meal, as I consider it a great item for grazing throughout the morning (or afternoon).  The entire package has 410 calories so it is a sizable portion of your daily recommended dietary intake.  Overall this is a great concept since it is a portable, non-perishable item.  It makes a great energy source for travel and hiking.  It is a product that I have never tried before.  I would definitely buy this with some degree of regularity.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.

review/summary: A Picnic Packed for Ewwwww
review/text: I wanted to like this.  I REALLY wanted to like this.  It is, in a word- HORRIBLE.<br /><br />The idea is a good one.  Meals that you can throw in a backpack or messenger bag, eat on the go, eat in the office, or just have in case you need a quick snack.  Each "meal" comes with several items that are differing in quality and texture- and appeal.<br /><br />Included in this package:<br /><br />Chili Lime Salmon Spread- nasty.  It is a fishy paste of minced up yuck flavored like leftover salmon and a too-sweet chili imitation.<br /><br />Organic Classic Rich Crackers- six crackers that taste as dry as the cardboard box the meal comes in.  A bad imitation of a Ritz cracker that misses the mark entirely.<br /><br />Ginger Zip Fruit & Nut Mix- its a sweet, very ginger infused, trail mix with sweet covered/candied peanuts, clusters of stuff, and craisins. Actually- the best part of the meal.<br /><br />Dry Roasted Edamame- on the box front, you see a picture of a vibrant, green, plump dish of Edamame.  Inside, you have a package of funky looking rejects of a food mumification project.  They taste like dust, diry, and the back end of a yak...I would imagine.  Horrible.  Just horrible.<br /><br />Robust Dark Chocolate Square- actually, this wasn't bad either, but reminded me of cheap chocolate.  The dark chocolate flavor felt too "fake" and the texture was a bit too waxy for me- but all in all, not bad either.<br /><br />So...great idea- but a terrible execution.  The food was a total mixed bag- but I did find use for the box of 6 that I was sent.  I ate two meals for review purposes...then to further cement my review I ate the remaining chocolate, the remaining trail mix, gave the fish paste posing as food to the cat, the crackers to the ducks in the pond and threw the dried edamame in the trash.  A better pre-packaged meal option is a military grade MRE- seriously.  And we all know the sterling reputation those lil' packages of awesome have.

review/summary: OVER PRICED CAT FOOD FOR VERY LAZY PEOPLE!
review/text: OK, I'm all for having some convenience here and there and a 8 point meal by weight watchers standards sounds intriguing, but this "meal" is really only a snack. Most of the items in this box, you would be better off buying in larger quantities and making your own servings from them. Dry roasted Edamame very tasty, trail mix good, crackers - check, but none of them are something you can't buy in a larger quantity, Chocolate same as the everything else in this over priced snack pack. Now, we get to the reason I was interested in trying this "meal"....the salmon spread! YUCK, I couldn't even finish it, it tasted like what I would think cat food taste like(probably worse)! Do yourself a favor and buy some similar items and buy some small reseal-able containers and make you own nutritious snacks or meals, they'll taste better and you'll save a lot of money.

review/text: This is truly some nasty salmon.  The taste and mouth feel are awful.  I love fish prepared in a variety of ways - but not mashed up with some yucky seasoning and put in a can.  I have served more appealing cat food (to cats of course).  The trail mix was mostly dried bananas.  The dried soy beans were flavorless.  The chocolate was ordinary.  The crackers were just OK as well.  All in all, a very disappointing box of food and certainly no picnic.

review/summary: Ready to Eat Snack
review/text: The title for this product should not include 'Meal' but 'Snack' instead.  The combination of salmon and crackers, dried edamame, dried fruit, and chocolate toffee doesn't seem like much of a meal but several snacks put together.  Regardless, that makes for a great lunch/snack while on the go.  My kids did some taste testing with me and really enjoyed the edamame (we did live in Japan though, so this was familiar to them), dried fruit and nuts, the crackers without salmon, and of course the chocolate.  I was worried the salmon would be too strong but it just had a hint of lime and chili.  A knife would have been nice to have to spread the salmon.  Overall I thought this would make a good snack for the kids and I in between outings or at the park.  Lots of fiber and a healthier options that a lot of products out there.

review/text: I live in California, and work closely with a team in southern India, which means that I spend most evenings on the phone or in video conferences. I tend to keep a stash of snack foods in my desk to bridge the 6-9pm gap until I can get home to eat. I've been trying to shift from sweet snacks to savory foods, preferably with a bit of flavor.  These GoPicnic products fit the bill perfectly.

review/summary: Pretty tasty with a good variety
review/text: The GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat meal comes in a cardboard box packed with individually canned and wrapped treats.  You get a pack of crackers, a small can of salmon, a square of dark chocolate, a bag of dried edamame and a bag of dried fruit and nut mix.  You also get a fork.<br /><br />I started off with the edamame, which was pretty good.  They tasted just like the large packs of roasted edamame that I've had from Costco. They can be a little dry and this "meal" is a bit dry and salty overall so you should definitely pack something to drink a long with it.<br /><br />The dried fruit and nuts had a ginger flavor to it, which I thought was really good.  I think these could have been a great snack on their own.<br /><br />The crackers are just regular crackers, kind of like Ritz.  The salmon comes in a small, pop top can, but for some reason, they give you a fork instead of a knife.  The salmon itself was a little fishy and had a mushy consistency.  You could definitely taste the chile and lime flavoring though.  This was probably my least favorite part of the package, but still palatable enough.<br /><br />The dark chocolate square was an excellent dessert at the end.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the variety that came in this GoPicnic, but I wouldn't really call this a meal, except maybe for little kids.  However, I'm not sure if kids would like the edamame and the salmon.  I think these could be a good snack for adults though.  The price is actually pretty reasonable considering the variety and the fancy packaging.

review/summary: Very decent for four bucks
review/text: The food is of real quality, not gourmet but still very good. The salmon was especially tasty. And at four bucks a pop when you buy six GoPics, this is a perfect alternative to crappy airline food, or crappy school lunches, or just prepackaged generally crappy food.<br /><br />If you like to eat well but sometimes have to suddenly go somewhere without time to make something good to take, and you know that fast food scams like gmo-filled fake-"healthy" places such as Chubway are just selling you processed junk, then these GoPicnic meals will save you lots of time and money and give you better food as well. Win/win/win.<br /><br />We keep a few tucked away in the cupboard and they've already saved us from eating worse and spending more a number of times.<br /><br />This is a fine prodcut, of which I think we'll soon see more, from many of the agri-biz idiots.<br />If you can't buy local and organic, this is a good stopgap in the meantime.

review/text: This is a really nice ready to eat meal on the go. It has a little bit of everything. You get crackers, salmon, fruit, edemame and some dark chocolate. Everything int the box is really good. Each item is individually wrapped. All you really need is a drink and you are set. I like to take these with me when I go hiking or go to the park and relax on the hammock. All the stuff doesn't take much space up in my backpack. If you get the stuff out of the box then you can fit it better on smaller backpacks. No need for fuel or stove when I go for overnight backpacking trips. I take a couple of these and I am set. The edemame are my favorite. They are almost like peanuts but with an edemame twist.

review/text: What really brings down my rating is the below cat food grade "Chili Lime Salmon". I mean, how can you go wrong with Chili Lime Salmon? That sounds absolutely delicious. I guess it doesn't translate well into a non-refrigerated slush. It tastes very cheap and fishy. I was expecting something on the level of canned tuna but this stuff is inedible. I couldn't finish it, so I gave it to my mom who eats anything and she said no thank you. I gave it to my cats and they sniffed it, then backed away slowly. My only other option would be to give it to the homeless people near my house, but I genuinely think they would be angry at me if I gave them this stuff. In short, stay away from the seafood slurry included in this box.<br /><br />For some reason, I don't care for the crackers that come with this either. I usually love multigrain crackers, but these taste like cardboard covered in a shiny egg wash.<br /><br />The fruit and nut mix was okay, but not as good as the Baja Blend in other GoPicnic boxes. I also taste zero ginger even though it's called "Ginger Zip".<br /><br />The Edamame wasn't bad either. I would eat more of it.<br /><br />The Buttercrunch Toffee was the best thing in the box. I wish someone mispackaged my boxes and included nothing but the toffee. Me want more.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this box again. I'd just get the toffee...and some more of that Baja Blend nut mix.

review/text: I was very pleasantly surprised by this product!  The salmon spread was extremely tasty, and I loved that it required no refrigeration and was completely portable.  It was delicious on the crackers.  Additionally, I was so pleased that there was healthy protein included in this:  so frequently on the go it is only carbs, carbs, carbs available, which do not last energy-wise.  I felt this was just enough to keep one going during a flight, and until the next meal on the ground, for instance.<br /><br />My toddler really liked the roasted edamame, as well as portions of the fruit and nut mix.  My version of this had a square of dark chocolate, which was of good quality;  now it looks as though they've changed the dessert portion to buttercrunch toffee, upon which I cannot comment.<br /><br />I would buy this again, and plan to for my next travel adventure.

review/summary: Not worth the money.
review/text: Others have reported on the taste, and I'm with the consensus - for boxed food it's decent.  Not spectacular.<br /><br />I'm mainly writing this review as a cost analysis.<br /><br />For the same price per box, here's what I was able to put together (all items from amazon):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005RRI3Z0">Splendid Spreads Brand, All Natural Salmon Spreads, International Variety Set, 6 Oz. Jars, Pack of 4 Jars</a>: 2 ounces<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YJBLMM">Crunchmaster Multi-Grain Crackers Gluten Free 20 oz.</a>: 1 ounce<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RJ1FAW">Emerald Harmony Deluxe Fruit N Nut Trail Mix, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>: 2 ounces<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A5WSMC">Roland Feng Shui Edamame, 4.4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>: 1 ounce<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZQTXG">Walkers Treacle Toffee, 3.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 10)</a>: 1 ounce<br /><br />That's 7 ounces, compared to GoPicnic's 4.3 ounces, and the price is actually less at the time of this writing.  Of course this doesn't all come neatly wrapped in a box, you'd have to use some Tupperware to split up the individual packages, but I'm willing to bet it tastes better.

It is more than enough food for me- I tend to eat bento lunches, so I like having little portions of a bunch of things. I didn't think that the edamame was too dry- what do you expect? Chewy dried edamame?? I would have given this five stars, except that the salmon dip was a little...odd. It was spicy for me, though my boyfriend didn't pick up on any spice at all. So if you're not like us, you'll probably find that it's just the right amount of spice. But the flavor of the salmon stuff is definitely unnatural and strange to me. I'll eat them all anyway- it's not that bad.

review/summary: As advertised....the good and the not so good
review/text: I've tried several of the gopicnic meal boxes and I will be upfront and say that one box is not the "perfect" meal. Each has their pluses and negatives. That being said, if I had to choose the one I liked the better out of them, I would go with this one. The spice in the salmon spread is a nice touch giving it some flavor. The nuts and chocolate are also good. The dry roasted edamame I'm not so sure about. They are...odd...and tends to be crumbly.<br /><br />I guess calling them "meals" is a bit of a misnomer since they are more snack-sized. I usually toss in a yogurt cup to add to the meal when I take one for my lunch. The big plus is that the gopicnic's do not need refrigeration and can stay on the shelf for a bit before they're outdated.  I think ones you get on airplanes actually give you more, but if you can get this past the security checkpoint, then I'd recommend it traveling, or for a quick lunch at work. Some have complained about the taste, but it's fine for me.

review/summary: Flavor promise unrealized, and stingy portions.
review/text: The most satisfying part of this snack assortment was the excellent dark chocolate.  Rest of the contents sounded so much better than they ended up tasting, and the quantities were small as well.  I really like these kinds of foods, but what was presented in this pack was a disappointment:<br /><br />- salmon spread, odd flavors.  I didn't find it as bad as some of the 1 star reviewers did, but it also didn't taste good enough for me to ever want more, and certainly didn't remind me of what salmon usually tastes like. I was expecting to be knocked over by fishy odor, but detected only slight fishiness.  It would have spread easier with a knife than the included fork.  Odd texture and sort of on the wet side, not surprising because the second and third ingredients were water and red pepper paste, which probably helped reduce the salmon flavor by diluting it.  Only about 3 tablespoons.<br /><br />- crackers, six small imitation Ritz crackers<br /><br />- fruit & nut mix, nice flavors, but too sugary.  3/4 ounce, would have liked more.<br /><br />- edamame, a bit too dry to eat pleasurably, tasted mildly bad (but if you like edamame you might like the flavor) 1 ounce.<br /><br />- chocolate, a really nice rich dark chocolate. 0.43 ounce, though small, it was satisfying.<br /><br />Besides the odd flavors, the size could be too small for a workday lunch (depending on your appetite), but it would be a sufficient snack for an adult, or maybe an lunch for a child who likes these oddities. (410 calories, 22g protein, 16g fat, and a whopping 48g of carbs).  What's with these micro portion sizes? There was almost more packaaging material than food.<br /><br />If you absolutely have to have a shelf-stable snack on hand, consider this if the contents particularly appeal to you.  But I feel it should have been better.

review/text: I love the idea.  Not that I'd want to look forward to this ready-to-eat meal as my lunch, but it would be reassuring to know that I have a few of these in one of my desk drawers in case I'm too busy to deal with lunch.<br /><br />So I love the idea.<br /><br />I also think the price makes sense (currently $24 for 6).<br /><br />I might even consider this meal as a convenient solution for traveling (since airlines don't really feed us anymore).<br /><br />The one thing I wouldn't do, though, is consider this to be a really good idea for a good meal.  It just isn't that good.<br /><br />So why am I not more enthusiastic?  It's the main course:  it was pretty bad.<br /><br />When I sampled mine, I was a little hurried and started with the odds and ends.  First the fruit snack, then the edamame, and so on.  Every one of these smaller snacks were really fantastic.<br /><br />I repeat:  Most of the stuff in this meal was REALLY FANTASTIC.  The dried edamame were creative, the fruit snack was original, the crackers were good, the chocolate was great.<br /><br />The problem was with the "main course", the salmon spread.  I love salmon.  I'll eat it in any way imaginable.  I think it's pretty hard to wreck salmon.  But somehow they found a way.  The taste and texture of the salmon spread was just weird.  Not that it was gross or sickening, it just wasn't appetizing.  What a shame.<br /><br />I'm a decent-sized guy who likes a decent meal.  I have fairly discerning tastes and I like to enjoy my food.  So this meal is merely a means to checking off a to-do item (fluids-check, grub-check, ...).  It's a way to avoid a totally disastrous day ("I had to work long hours and didn't even have time for lunch...").<br /><br />So all in all, I'd probably buy another set of these to keep around for emergencies, but I wouldn't consider this meal to be "Plan A".  This meal would be a backup plan for when my day goes off track.

review/summary: OK overall
review/text: For convenience, this is excellent. Everything comes individually wrapped with expiration dates beyond that printed on the box. It even includes a wrapped fork and a Sudoku puzzle on the box bottom. Some may complain about excessive packaging, but it does keep the contents dry. I stuck mine in with some fruit and the outer box soaked up some moisture and became damp, so I appreciate the individual packaging.<br /><br />For taste, this falls a little short. The salmon spread did have a slight chili flavor but very little lime taste. The texture was strange--somewhat mushy and like a gritty jelly. There was a definite fishiness. The crackers were OK; they were similar to Ritz crackers. I have had the edamame before and they were as expected. To me, the best part was the fruit and nut mix. It has a nice flavor although I did not get many banana bits.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the meal was underwhelming. It was not enough to fill me. I thought it was a little expensive for the amount of food.

review/summary: Satisfying, healthy road food
review/text: This upscale pre-packed lunch is tasty, healthy, imaginative and handy. In this case the product description on Amazon does give the ingredients but not the Nutrition Facts a label-reading purchaser might want: Per box, 410 calories, Total Fat 16 grams - 25% Daily Value, Saturated Fat 5g - 25% DV, Cholesterol 10 milligrams - 3% DV, Sodium 660mg - 28% DV, Total Carbohydrates 48g - 16% DV, of which Dietary Fiber is 11g - 44% DV and sugars 21g, Protein 22g, Vit A 0%, Vit C 10%, Calcium 0%, Iron 10%.<br /><br />Of supreme importance to some is the Allergen information which has been carefully noted on the box: the spread contains fish; the crackers contain wheat and soy; the fruit and nut mix contains peanuts, almonds, cashews, pecans, walnuts, Brazil nuts, hazelnuts, milk-containing products, wheat, soy; the edamame is manufactured in a plant that processes peanuts and other nuts; the dark chocolate is made on equipment that also produces soy, milk, wheat, peanut and tree nuts.<br /><br />Other reviewers have discussed the various foods included so no need to go down the list again; just to say that I found everything included to be tasty. No complaints! ...Although I would say that I agree with the observations that the packaging adds significantly to the waste stream (but I can't suggest an alternative), and a plastic spreader would have worked better than a fork.<br /><br />This is an excellent repast for those who can justify the expense. Others have pointed out that in certain circumstances, this lunch kit may actually be cost effective because decent food, if available, may be even more expensive - or far too inconvenient.

review/summary: A good-to-go lunch!
review/text: This is a cute little packet and an easy way to find a simple lunch when you're on the move and don't like fast food.  What's even nicer is that these are heart healthy and contain no MSG, HFCS, or trans fats.  It's a definite treat to find them all in a one portion lunch kit.<br /><br />This has a good little selection of items in it, the salmon and crackers, a fruit and nut mix, dry roasted edamame, and a small piece of dark chocolate.  Although I was a little suspicious of salmon in a plastic container, it is tasty.  The salmon has a little kick to it that keeps it from tasting like tuna fish.  The dried fruit and nut mix are surprisingly good.  The edamame?  It's alllll riiiiight if you like that sort of thing.  Put enough salt on it and I'll eat it.  A small piece of chocolate brings this lunch to a sweet and dark end.<br /><br />I'm planning to get a six pack of these to keep in the car.  So many times when I'm out running errands, I dig around the bottom of my purse and end up having a smushed protein bar for lunch.  This is an awesome replacement.

review/summary: didn't impress me but not bad
review/text: I liked the last go picnic product I tried but this one is only so-so.  First, the salmon spread - squishy and not much flavor despite the chili.  The Late July crackers are good but without something good to go on top, they're just crackers.  The fruit and nut mix was really good but only a small taste.  I ate the dried edamame peas didn't taste bad or good.  Also, they were so dry that I got the hiccups!  The chocolate was the best part and just about right; a very small square.  However, if you took this with you on a hike, the chocolate would melt.<br /><br />On the plus side, if you are burning a lot of calories, this pack provides plenty of healthy calories to replenish you - 410 calories in the pack.  16 grams of fat comes from edamame peas, peanuts and salmon (and a few from the crackers).  You get 22g of protein.  There are 48 grams of carbohydrates with 21 of those as sugar and 11 grams of FIBER! The products inside this little box are all top quality and generally organic.  It's not bad, just didn't impress me with flavor and texture.

review/summary: Crunchy and Fun but Pack a Drink Also
review/text: I found the GoPicnic Salmon & Crackers lunch to be a cut above most commercially packed lunches in flavor and nutritional value. With only 410 calories, it still made a satisfying meal with lots of "chew appeal". The dominant texture was crunchy: crackers, fruit and nut snack and the little bag of dry roasted soybeans each made a different crunchy noise in the mouth. The banana chips in the fruit snack were quite hard and the soybeans (called edamame on the package) needed lots of chewing. The latter were dry to the core and lightly salted so when chewed they gradually ground to powder in the mouth and provoked thirst. I remembered eating these (in a fresher version) in Japanese bars. The salmon spread is brightly colored, spicy hot and is a great foil for the soybeans which are neutral underneath the light salting. The crackers are delicate and make perfect platforms for the salmon. The dark chocolate is excellent--a very pure flavor, not too sweet.<br /><br />Although salt is not laid in with a deliberately heavy hand, nearly everything here has salt in it. Because one box contains 660mg of sodium, this isn't designed for folks on a low salt diet. I'd definitely pack a drink of fruit juice if this was to be my lunch box for the day or/and add an apple or orange to counterbalance the dryness of this portable lunch. Beer would work also but might not be practical...

review/summary: nice snack but not at that price
review/text: I enjoyed most of the snack but not the salmon spread.  I love fish.  But this spread was too rich and not salty enough.  And it left a funny taste in my mouth.  Still, the rest of the snack made up for that.  The crackers were nice and tasty; the dry-roasted soybeans are as addictive as you'd expect and the fruit and nut mix was great.  (The nut and fruit mix does have peanuts so if you're allergic you should know that.) And the chocolate candy was fantastic.  So everything except the salmon was great so maybe the other products in that line are better.<br /><br />The only other thing I'd add is that this is definitely a snack and not a meal.  So, all told, I am not sure it's worth it for the kind of price they're asking.

review/summary: Great concept, nice snacks, not quite a picnic...
review/text: Growing up on the free lunch program at school I wasn't exposed to the unhealthy treats and convinience foods of my peers until I was in my teens. Maybe that's part of why I prefer a warm soup with toast or a sandwich piled with veggies over peanut butter sandwiches and pudding cups. Keeping that in mind I thought this version of the Ready-to-Eat Meal would suit my palate and fill my tummy nicely.<br /><br />I'll admit, I love novelty and there's just something about single-serving packaging that makes me all excited. Lime-chili Salmon Spread? Snack mix with Ginger Peanuts? It all sounded so fancy and grown-up. But then I looked at the outer package's nutritional info. At 400+ calories for this handful of snackage I was a little leary. Lots of fat (though I'd say with salmon some of it is the good kind) and lots of fiber. Read the nutrition info and you be the judge whether this would be for you.<br /><br />Let me offer my assessment of the individual food items. The crackers were perfect, just the sort of thing I'd want to put a spread on, crisp and mild in flavor, solid enough to handle being topped. The salmon spread was nice in theory but had a (for lack of a better word) sludgey quality to it. I didn't taste lime and the chili was barely noticable, this felt like someone had tossed raw salmon in a blender and canned it. I was not impressed and I am a salmon LOVER. The Edamame were too dry but not overly salted as some can be. The portion on those was pretty big and since they aren't my favorite alone I was happy to move on. The mix of dried cranberries, banana chips and ginger peanuts was interesting and actually pretty yummy. The portion size looks like a lot on the box but was actually much smaller. My one complaint was that most of the ginger was rubbed off the peanuts and had settled into the bottom of the package. Lastly, the dark chocolate was a nice treat at the end, a decent quality and with a great texture.<br /><br />Overall this was not quite my cup of tea. Aside from my comments regarding the individual items I must say I was still hungry after my GoPicnic. This would make a nice item to toss into your bag for a post-gym nosh if you're a lunch-time gym-goer or a good thing to pack when taking that dreaded family road trip so you could skip the fast food. I'd probably pick a different pack for myself but overall I really dig this idea and think the options in these being fruit, whole grains and healthy protiens are brilliant.

review/summary: Decent, but not great.
review/text: So, here we go. The latest in picnic stuff for the Whole Foods crowd. It wasn't bad, really, but it wasn't anything special, and I don't really see the interest.<br /><br />First, we have the salmon and chili lime paste. Now I like salmon, but I'm not used to it having a bit of a bite. It's not horribly spicy or anything like that, but you know it's there. It was fairly tasty, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />Next the crackers. They're crackers. Moving on.<br /><br />The fruit and nut mix. This contained bananas, cranberries and peanuts. All were dried and apparently dusted with ginger, thus potentially addictive to any alien lizards out there. The taste on these wasn't bad, but again, nothing special.<br /><br />Then we come to the horror of this package. The dried edamame. Why, oh, why, would anyone eat this? Not just lacking flavor, they actually seemed to suck out any flavor in my mouth from the previous food. Worse than that, while they didn't have any actual taste, they had an aftertaste that was truly something to behold, and not in a good way.<br /><br />Then, finally, we have the organic dark chocolate. It's chocolate. Pretty hard to screw up. I would have preferred milk chocolate, but that's just me.<br /><br />So there you go. Overall this pack wasn't bad, but that edamame really killed it hard. That stuff was really awful. Otherwise, it's largely inoffensive and tasty, but overpriced. You can do better elsewhere.

review/summary: Needs fine-tuning
review/text: First let me say what is right about this product.  It is a nice mix of items and textures, consisting of packages of spread, crackers, a slab of dark chocolate, toasted edamame nuts, and a mix of dried banana slices, cranberries, and dry honey roasted peanuts.  There is sufficient food for a quick lunch or snack, with crunchies left for later.  A plastic fork is included.<br /><br />The spread is ample for the six buttery tasting crackers, and is neither too stiff to spread nor too runny. It is sweet with a bit of heat; too sweet for my taste, and I could barely taste the salmon.  There could have been more of the fruit and nut mix, and less of the edamame, which my partner found undersalted and slightly musty tasting.  The dark chocolate was OK.<br /><br />For a grab-and-go product, it was better than many.  Only 410 calories, which is great, but has over 600 mg. of salt, more than 1/4 the rda for an adult.

review/summary: It's OK
review/text: After reading the negative review that rated this kit below military MREs I was afraid that the food will be terrible, but I tried to keep an open mind when I was tasting it.  In my opinion, this kit is not nearly as bad as that review portrayed it to be.<br /><br />I liked the salmon spread and the crackers. Although, for my taste, the spread was a little on a liquid side the flavor was good and it combined well with crackers.  I also liked the dried fruit and the chocolate.<br /><br />The only item that I thought was not good at all is the Dry Roasted Edamame (I do like normal edamame that is served in Japanese restaurants).  I thought the beans were too dry, the flavor was not good, and it was too much of it compared to other items.  Also the look of it was not appetizing at all - dirty green color with a lot of peeled dry skin inside the package.<br /><br />I had this kit for lunch and it filled me up.  Considering that it contains 410 calories, I say it was not bad.  I think that if the company reworked or replaced the edamame item, I would have liked the food more.<br /><br />In my opinion, the current price of thirty bucks for six pack (five bucks per kit) is way too high.  There is absolutely no way (banning food shortages) I would pay that much for this kit.  In my view, this kit might work as a snack when taking kids out to a park, but I would not buy it to feed friends or take to a romantic picnic.

review/summary: GoPicnic Review
review/text: Having a neatly prepackaged lunch that doesn't need refrigeration is a good idea, but GoPicnic needs a lot more work on the items they are including in their "picnic in a box" before it's something I'll want to keep in the cupboard.<br />The packaging is cute - small and eaily portable - something you could throw in a bookbag or purse.  Some of the items included were fairly tasty like the dry roasted edamame and the dried fruit and nut combo.  I  enjoyed both.  The salmon spread, however, was completely disgusting.  It looked and smelled worse than any cat food I've ever seen.  Since I've never eaten cat food, I can't say which is better of the two.  I cannot imagine, however, that cat food could taste much worse than this stuff did. Also included were a small square of dark chocolate and some crackers which, while not impressive, were not unpleasant.  Overall, the box added up to more of a variety of snack items than a meal and at around $5 each, it's pricey for the amount of food you actually get. I wouldn't purchase this item again and, after the trauma that the salmon spread caused, I would be leary of trying other varieties of GoPicnic.

review/summary: The chocolate square was good
review/text: but the rest of it was not so great, actually.<br /><br />1. Dry Roasted Edamame (soybeans). I couldn't eat them. Tasted like dust. I do like edamame generally and do eat soy products, but this incarnation was not edible.  The good point of it the high protein, so if you like the taste, they do provide nutritional value.<br /><br />2. Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix. OK, but too sweet. Dried fruits without sugar would be fine IMHO.<br /><br />3. Crackers--not bad. They are billed as "organic", and the ingredients are pretty healthy, but they are made with "organic wheat flour" (ie, white flour) and not whole grain, so they could have more flavor and fiber if they had whole wheat or other whole grain.  You get six small round crackers that look like Ritz, but not as sweet.<br /><br />4. Salmon Spread for the crackers--mediocre. They have added a lot of water to this product, and the soupy consistency is unappealing.<br /><br />5. Chocolate square--all's well that ends well?<br /><br />In summary, this product while handy in terms of size, storage and shelf-life, does not live up to the purpose intended. Unlike some other Vine reviewers, I only got one package, which, in this case is OK.  I would be willing to try other varieties of this product, but the "salmon and crackers" is not one I would buy or recommend.

review/summary: Despite the organic labeling, not all that healthy a choice
review/text: "Salmon+crackers" is advertised as a "ready to eat meal." At just under four and a half ounces net weight it 's more of a snack than a meal, but leaving that aside, I found many other issues with this product.<br /><br />It's further advertised as a balanced meal featuring a number of organic components. But a look at the side panel tells the tale: 410 calories, 150 of these from fat; 5g saturated fat; 660mg of sodium; and 48g of carbohydrates including 21g of sugar. Healthy? Not even close. The only redeeming feature is 22g of protein.<br /><br />There are five components in the mix. There's a bag of dry roasted edamame. If you're not familiar with edamame, it's a popular Asian snack or appetizer. The dry roasted edamame in the GoPicnic package were very dry indeed and had suffered a huge loss of characteristic flavor.<br /><br />Next is the Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix. I found this to be at once too salty and too sweet. I suspect a lot of the sodium and sugar was in this package.<br /><br />Then we have the Late July Organic Classic Rich Crackers, which are quite similar to Ritz crackers. There were six of them; they were fresh and crispy with a nice crunch and bite, and not too salty or sweet.<br /><br />The GoPicnic Chili Lime Salmon Spread is, obviously, made to spread on the crackers. More than enough spread is provided for the six crackers, though you'll need to have remembered your own knife or something to actually do the spreading. There was a nice chili taste, not too strong, and a clean lime taste. But the salmon spoiled it all. There were little shreds of salmon and one big chunk; the mix obviously wasn't mixed very well. And it tasted much more like sardine than salmon. The fish had an "old" taste and smell that was very unappealing.<br /><br />The package was completed with a Terra Nostra Organic Robust Dark Chocolate Square, which had a nice bitterness and strong cocoa flavor; it was perhaps a bit strong on buttery mouth feel, but it was really quite good.<br /><br />If you're thinking of getting these to serve to children, that may not be the best idea. They won't like the salmon spread and they likely won't like the edamame.<br /><br />If you're thinking of serving these to adults, there are probably much better, healthier options. It wouldn't be all that hard to make up your own package with tastier, healthier, and more substantial contents.<br /><br />I can't recommend the GoPicnic Salmon+Crackers. It's neither healthy nor particularly good.

review/summary: Don't judge this meal by its cover...
review/text: Bottom line: I expected better. Better taste, better quality, etc. Two things really impacted my three star rating here: the salmon and the plastic fork...<br /><br />Packaging:<br />The packaging is fun, but it's misleading. There are fewer crackers and far fewer bits of the fruit and nut mixed than shown own the actual packaging. In addition, my salmon certainly did NOT look like what you see on the box. I'll add this on packaging as well, but for a product going for the "all-natural" and certified organic route, I was a little surprised that the included fork was actually plastic and not a biodegradable product. The best part about this package was the Sudoku game at the bottom!<br /><br />Salmon:<br />My chili lime salmon was mushy, and I didn't see any nice looking chunks as per the box. It was more of a puree than a mix of salmon. My wife tasted it with me and we definitely agree that it tasted a bit more fishy than we're used to with salmon. We also had to sort through a few boney parts. Additionally, the chili had a kick by the lime seemed to be hiding away somewhere.<br /><br />Crackers:<br />The crackers were great! I can't get how they make something taste so buttery without butter!<br /><br />Edamame:<br />There was a ton of edamame in comparison to the other portions. I thought the roasted edamame was pretty decent, but my wife said that it had a bad aftertaste.<br /><br />Fruit & Nuts Mix:<br />This was probably the highlight of the whole box; the peanuts were sweet, salty and had a great taste of ginger. I will probably try to find where I can purchase this mix because it was so great; the dried cranberries and bananas were a nice compliment.<br /><br />Chocolate:<br />Organic and tasty. At 60% Cacoa, I expected a little more bitterness from the chocolate, but didn't really taste it (I think this would have been better with a little bitterness) - but it was still good.<br /><br />Last notes:<br />I'm not sure I would try this again. The Salmon really kind of ruined it for me; at the end of the day, the only way I can encapsulate my description of it is "slightly nasty." Everything else was fine, but the box wasn't defined by everything else, it was defined by the Salmon...

review/summary: It's a mixed bag
review/text: The chili lime salmon spread is a little on the fishy side and also a bit on the spicy side.  If you like like a bit of spice then you might enjoy it.  On a scale of 1-10, it's about a 6 in terms of spiciness.  The salmon is smashed up into a paste, so don't expect salmon filets.  The slight fishiness was a slight putoff.<br /><br />The salmon comes with a small package of 6 "Late July" organic crackers (90 calories, vegan) which were very good, as crackers go.  They are similar to Ritz crackers, only more of an oval shape.<br /><br />A small package of "Sweet Perry Orchards" "Ginger Zip" fruit and nut mix was part of the meal.  It includes peanuts with a crunchy ginger coating, banana chips and dried cranberries.  It's a tiny little package, not even 1 ounce.<br /><br />Also included is 1 ounce of "Seapoint Farms" "Dry Roasted Edamame".  This product is very crunchy and healthy.  While it contains 14 grams of protein, it's not very exciting but decent nonetheless.  Still, 14 grams of soy protein in only 1 ounce of edamame is pretty good nutritionally-speaking.  They are lightly salted.<br /><br />If you'd like some chocolate with your fish paste, you'll receive 0.43 ounces of Terra Nostra Organic Dark 60% Cacao.  This chocolate is darker than what I'm used to due to the 60% cacao content, but it's good.  But again, it's just one little piece, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />I don't believe this that this product represents a good value at it's current price as of this writing.  I can't particularly recommend it, although some people might like it.  But the price coupled with the small size of each serving  (4.4 ounces) coupled with the fishiness of the salmon paste was not especially to my liking.

What I really liked most was the fruit and nut mix with dried bananas, ginger peanuts and cranberries. What a great combination. And to finish your snack meal there is some organic chocolate which is the best dark chocolate I've ever tasted.

review/summary: Not too big and not too tasty
review/text: If I had to sum up what I though of "GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers," I would probably say that it is an adult form of the popular "lunchables" that were easy-to-make lunches for kids to take to school with them.  This is about the same size as those kid's lunches, which means that it's probably not going to fill an adult up and is therefore not really to be considered a meal.  It's a pretty in-depth snack to take on a hike or even to just eat at home if you need to nibble; and it contains 22g protein, 11g fiber, and 410 calories.  However, it's not the tastiest food in the world, and I'm not sure that I actually liked it all that much.<br /><br />The box has a tab that will pull in order to open the box, and inside you will find the following: a plastic fork, a plastic container of salmon spread, a package containing six crackers, a mini bag of a fruit/nut trail mix, a mini bad of dry roasted soy beans (edamame), and a square of chocolate.  I personally didn't even use the fork since I found it better to use a knife to spread the salmon with.  As for the salmon's taste...it was fishy with a hint of citrus.  I appreciate good salmon, but this was not good, in my opinion.  The crackers were delicious, though (how can you ruin those?).  I didn't like the roasted soy beans either; they were like burnt sunflower seeds with a peanut texture.  As for the fruit/nut trail mix, it contained very few banana chips, cranberries, and peanuts.  They were all covered with a layer of sugar, which, of course, made them delicious.  The chocolate was divine, as well, but the square was very, very small.  Another thing to note is that on the inside of the box, there are some interesting facts and a sudoku puzzle.<br /><br />Overall, I would just have to say that I personally like the layout of this product but not so much the ingredients.  I would love to try another type such as the steak nuggets or turkey pepperoni, but I will not be buying this one again.  I would definitely encourage you to try the other types of the GoPicnic series, but I just can't recommend this one.

review/summary: Mediocre
review/text: There is something magical about a box lunch, the merger of opening a present and the anticipation of a good meal. The GoPicnic ready to eat meal is a box lunch for hiking, picnicking, and school field trips. It requires no refrigeration, but does have a limited shelf life.<br /><br />The portion size is good for children, although teens and adults may still be hungry after eating one. The Salmon and Cracker meal includes a salmon spread, crackers, a � oz. pack of fruit & nut mix, dry roasted edamame, and a chocolate square. The whole meal has 410 calories with 16 g of fat and 660 mg of sodium. The selections sound healthy, but more effort could have been made to cut down on fat and salt. No drink is included. A fork is included, but no napkin. The box is study and the crackers were undamaged.<br /><br />The salmon spread is tasty enough to wish the portion were larger. The crackers are indistinguishable from Ritz crackers. The fruit & nut mix is mostly peanuts and banana chips, with a rare dried cranberry. The dry roasted edamame puts the emphasis on "dry." The highlight is the chocolate square. The salt content is evident in the taste and in the need to have a drink handy.<br /><br />The cost, $5/meal, seems high for what you get.<br /><br />In summary, the GoPicnic Salmon and Crackers meal is a good attempt at healthy food for on-the-go, but the attempt misses the mark. Like a Catskills comedian, I have to complain that the food was mediocre and the portions were small.

review/summary: I thought I was eating baby food
review/text: I often times wonder who sits in on these food meetings to determine the nutritional value of a product like this. While it is no mean feat to design something visually appealing, with just the right number of calories to appear healthy, taste and consistency of flavor should be at the forefront of the mind. Upon arrival both my wife and I thought the product was great. Everything was packaged nice, it looked like the perfect little quick lunch or in between meals snack. The ginger coated peanuts were delicious, the edamame (soy nuts) were great, and even the bit of chocolate that was included was delightful.<br /><br />As with all of these quick snacks though, e.g. lunchables or tuna packs from starkist, the assumption is that if they cannot put an entire sandwich in the box, they may as well go for a cracker and "meat" combo to make up for it. Lunchables pioneered the concept commercially and it seems as if everyone else is playing catch up. In this aspect and this aspect only has "go picnic" failed miserably. They have taken one of the most healthiest fish, salmon, and mascerated it beyond recognition. They should be embarrassed to call it salmon. The flavors of chile and lime should be great, instead it is just one big mess. It looks like baby food, has the texture of baby food, but is not fit for human consumption. Since this is the main course they desparately need to go back to the drawing board if they expect to not end up on the shelves at Big Lots or any other remainder item merchandiser.

review/summary: Reminds me of Airline style food
review/text: When I first popped open the box, it sort of reminded me of past "Economy" flight meals.  I got my peanuts, my crackers, the meat, and some chocolate.  It has that feel, and taste.  You really do eat with your eyes first.<br /><br />The small box is really a snack in my opinion.  It has the nutrition to be classified as a meal though.  Each box contains 410 calories, with 16g of fat, 48g of carbs, and 22g of protein.  The only thing it lacks is heft to make it a satisfying meal.<br /><br />The entire meal is organic and contains no trans fats, high fructose corn syrup, or MSG.  It doesn't need refrigeration as long as it is stored in room temperature.  The shelf life seems to be about 6 months.<br /><br />I enjoyed the crackers and salmon, and found the fruit and nut mix delightful.  The dry roasted endamame was not too good though.  I prefer mine steamed, and them being roasted made me very thirsty.  Make sure you pack something to drink if you are eating this on the go.<br /><br />The chocolate didn't have much taste, but was a nice touch to finish off the "meal".<br /><br />All in all, it's a nice idea, and if you like to bring lunch to work and don't want to eat anything too heavy, this is a great alternative.

review/summary: Tasty Light Lunch
review/text: gopicnic is a more healthy version of the Lunchables that are so popular, and this variety is quite good.<br /><br />For allergy sufferers, the warnings for all the internal packets are printed clearly on the side of the box under the nutrition information. Similarly, all the ingredients are on an end panel, and I can pronounce all of them. I like the lack of MSG, trans fats, or the dreaded HFCS.<br /><br />Everything in the package was fresh tasting and flavorful. The light crispy crackers have a Ritz-like flavor. Salmon spread had a good flavor with nice spice bite, but not overpowering. A knife would have been a better implement, rather than the included plastic fork, for spreading the salmon. The ginger zip fruit & nut mix was also fresh crispy, but I didn't detect much ginger flavor, even in the bits of coating that had come off the nuts. The edamame was crispy and crunchy, lightly salty. The chocolate square is a nice dark chocolate, but not bitter.<br /><br />With the addition of a beverage of your choice, this would make a healthier option for lunch than a trip to the burger joint or the vending machine.<br /><br />The only down side to this type of meal is the amount of packaging. While the carton is made of 100% recycled fiber (at least 35% post-consumer) and can go into the recycling bin, everything else goes in the trash. Even that, though, is a minimum. The only plastic is the cup for the salmon and the fork. The rest is cellophane or foil wrap.<br /><br />Though a homemade lunch may be cheaper this isn't a bad alternative.

review/summary: Yums!
review/text: When I ordered this GoPicnic set, I thought all I was getting was the crackers and salmon spread, but to my delight, it's a full lunch set. You get the crackers and spread, dried edamame, ginger nuts and dried fruit, and a little organic chocolate. For the most part, I thought this was really tasty. The salmon spread does taste like salmon, which is great, and the lime and chili complement it well. It's just a tad spicy, so mild that I didn't even notice it until I was well into eating it. I liked the slight kick, and it shouldn't bother people with sensative tongues. The crackers are organic, but you wouldn't know it. They're crunchy and buttery, kind of like Ritz crackers. My favorite item was the fruit and nut mix. They were salty and sweet, and the ginger went so well with the nuts peanuts and cranberries. It had a slight kick, no more than the salmon spread, and this was a great complement. The chocolate was ok. If you've had organic chocolate before, you know what to expect. It wasn't very sweet at 60% cacao, and it wasn't very smooth. Not really my thing, but eh. The only thing I didn't really like was the dried edamame. I generally like edamame, but dried... the first few bites were good. I liked the dry, almost flaky texture. But after a few bites, it tasted a bit weird.<br /><br />This has 16g of fat (25% of your daily value), but only 5g of saturated fat (25% daily value), most of which come from the salmon spread. There are 410 calories and 150 calories from fat.There are only 10mg cholesterol (3% daily value). There are 48g of carbohydrates (16% daily value) and 11g dietary fiber (44% daily value). The sodium isn't bad at 660mg (28% daily value), and neither are the sugars at 21g. The biggest problem is that there's not a whole lot of nutritional value here. You get 22g protien, which is pretty good, but only 10% of your daily value for iron and vitamin C. Fish has plenty of omega-3s, though, and peanuts and cranberries are full of anti-oxidants, so that's something.<br /><br />The packaging is very nice. I love the colors and design, especially the blue gingham pattern on the top. On the inside, there are fun facts and even a sudoku puzzle for you to complete. It's easy to open, and everything comes in its own easy to open packaging. There's a plastic fork for you to use, though I didn't need it. It doesn't all seem biodegradeable, though, and some might not like that.<br /><br />Overall, this was a very tasty lunch set. It was pretty filling and not bad for you. A great alternative to things like Lunchables, which are just full of sodium. Recommended!

review/summary: Useful for hiking and may be a good emergency item to have on hand
review/text: I like the concept here that GoPicnic has.  The box is convenient although I would imagine that a flatter type of design of sorts would make it more 'carryable' for hiking or even camping.<br /><br />I live in earthquake country and always look for things to have to store or have available for a possible disaster.  If you live in EQ, hurricane or Tornado country, this may be a handy thing to add to your store of goods for such an event.  Although the shelf life is somewhat short, you would have to cycle older product out more often.<br /><br />Someone mentioned in another review that the salmon smelled rather 'fishy' which initially raised an eyebrow, but the taste of the salmon was rather good although some may find it spicy.  I found the spicyness more of a zing and it faded quickly with the crackers, edamame and ginger zip trail mix.  The chocolate mini bar in the pack it a dark chocolate that has a very rich taste and a great ending to a quick meal.<br /><br />I want to try the other brands of GoPicnic for the possibility of kids at school using them once in a while for lunch.  Maybe the salmon is too strong for them unless they have their tastes developed for it.<br /><br />The edamame nuts were tasty and good addition. The crackers where nice for the meal and did not add flavor or take away flavor from the salmon and the trail mix was good.<br /><br />Overall, a great little addition for a quick hike.  The box says the total calories is about 410, pretty good for a snack that has so much variety.  I would like to see the price come down some how, however, the way it is packaged probably requires the price that you see.<br /><br />Try GoPicnic and have fun with it.

review/summary: Good alternative to similar, less healthy products
review/text: I have to admit that I wasn't overwhelmed with adoration for this product, although it is a nice alternative to less healthy versions of this type of meal.<br /><br />The food was all fresh and tasty.  The salmon is in a little container similar to the dipping sauces you would get for chicken nuggets at McDonalds, already prepared with the sauce (I wasn't expecting that.. I though it would have to be mixed)  It was nice that it wasn't mixed with mayonnaise.  You peel off the top label and then use the fork to put small amounts on the crackers.  I didn't think there would be enough, as it doesn't seem like much, but it turned out there was plenty.  The crackers are "Late July" brand - a slightly healthier version of a Ritz.  The trail mix was decent.. the ginger peanuts tasted neither like ginger or peanuts, but were good just the same.  The dried edamame was fine, but I didn't finish it.. there was simply too much of that particular texture and flavor for me to want it all, even though it was a small bag.  The chocolate, as you might expect was a nice treat!<br /><br />My biggest problem with this item is that at the end of eating it (even had I finished the edamame), I just wasn't full.  It is not substantial enough to be a meal.  Also, not that expected differently, but the amount of trash at the end of the meal considering how little food there was is embarrassingly unsustainable.  The plastic fork they included probably should have been compostable-style given the audience this is appealing to, but was not.<br /><br />The box had a sudoku puzzle printed on the inside for those looking for entertainment on the go while they snack, but maybe they should have then included a little golf pencil or something like that.<br /><br />It was good.  But I don't think I'm going to order more.

review/summary: A healthy meal-to-go option that is not too bad tasting
review/text: Specifically marketed towards the health conscious, the all-organic "GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers" is a pretty good meal-to-go alternative. The cracker and salmon combo is quite tasty, fairly rich tasting, while not being too salty, while the fruit and nut mix and the organic chocolate bar both provide a nice sweet treat. About the only thing I didn't really enjoy was the dry roasted edamame; it wasn't awful tasting (and was particularly filling), but the taste was bland and dry to my palate.<br /><br />A few caveats: "GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers" is not for everyone, to be sure. Those weaned on Kraft "lunchables" will probably miss the heavily processed and salty taste they have become accustomed to with those types of meals-to-go.<br /><br />Also, as is the case with so many healthy food alternatives, this is clearly priced towards an upscale market. While the cost of $5.00 per box is competitive with (or if you live in the NYC area, actually cheaper than) other health-oriented meal-to-go alternatives, it is certainly priced higher than mainstream meal-to-go products, such as the aforementioned Kraft "Lunchables" (priced at around $3.60 a box here on Amazon.com). This means that those on a tight budget are once again left out in the cold when it comes to choosing healthy foods alternatives. When is that inequity ever going to be truly addressed?<br /><br />All things aside, "GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers" is a good meal-to-go alternative and worth picking up for those so inclined.

review/summary: Quality Food For People On The Go
review/text: GoPicnic is a great organic alternative to fast food on the go.<br /><br />The meal in each package consists of four parts:<br /><br />The chili-lime salmon spread and crackers, a fruit & nut mix containing ginger peanuts, cranberries, and banana chips (though ours only contained one chip), dry roasted edamame, and a dark chocolate square.<br /><br />This was surprisingly filling, quality food.  My body even felt good after eating, so I know it wasn't cleverly-disguised junk.  My children enjoyed the chocolate, salmon spread and crackers (Ritz-like, but organic). We all agreed that the dark chocolate didn't have the strong, bitter after taste we've found with other dark chocolate varieties. I preferred the dry roasted edamame & dried fruit & nut mix.  I found the salmon to be too watered-down (I'm more of a chunky spread person).  I couldn't taste the salmon enough over the chili-lime, but the children disagreed (they don't like chunks).<br /><br />This ready-to-eat meal is nutritious, well packaged (brightly-colored wrapping, includes Sudoku grid in each box) and tasty. This is great for traveling in the car with my children, who usually want to stop off for fast food (it has the Lunchable-type appeal to kids).  It is a bonus that we can eat out of the same box-less waste and I don't go hungry (also curbs my ravenous sugar cravings)!<br /><br />As a health conscious mom, I am satisfied.

review/summary: Tasty, but not enough food for the price
review/text: I pack a lunch every single day, because if I don't, I wind up begging someone to cover for me while I do the Burger King drive-thru. That's not good for my wallet or my arteries, so I was excited about this product. Wholesome and healthy? With a delicious sounding menu? Yum!<br /><br />It really is made from natural ingredients, and it is as good as it sounds. I was a little worried that the salmon "spread" might be gross, but it wasn't, and it wasn't boring, either. The assortment of sides is nice, and they're all tasty, too, although I think the edamame could have used a little more salt.<br /><br />However, it's not enough food for me for lunch, and I'm not a big eater. When I do the Burger King thing, I get a Whopper Jr and a value fry, and I never finish the fries. This is 410 calories if you eat every bite, and I think my optimum lunch intake is ~500 calories. Maybe if I paired it with soda or juice it would do the job, but I try hard to drink only water, so...I'd rather supplement it with other food. That kind of defeats the purpose though.<br /><br />The other thing that will likely keep me from buying these after my Vine-supply runs out is just the price. $4 each isn't horrendous for a lunch, and it's worth the extra to me over a Whopper/fry meal, but it's a lot more than packing leftovers. I *might* buy a box to keep in my desk for emergencies -- and for that purpose, the size would probably be fine -- but it's unlikely that I'll start eating them every day.

review/text: i know they call these meals on the go and I think these are great snack items to have around or keep when you are going to need a quick and easy meal.  I've tried these before and liked but this is my first time with the salmon.  I love salmon and cook it frequently or eat canned salmon when I want a quick snack.  However, the salmon was the one thing I just didn't like so much.  It is very tangy and very fishy at the same time.  I make orange and lemon salmon all the time but this was just nothing like that in its flavor.  It's hard to describe but I think you would like if you like a spicy fishy tangy combination.  Everything else in there was very tasty.  Even the edamame wasn't so bad.  If you remember you are eating a healthier replacement for peanuts, they really start to taste like them.  The chocolate, crackers and fruit and nut mix were all good.  I just didn't like the chili lime salmon so much.

Really.<br /><br />The Terra Nostra Organic Robust Dark 60% Cacao was rock hard and resisted melting in the mouth.

review/summary: Great idea, not good taste
review/text: I liked the idea of a "grab and go" type lunch or snack, so decided to give this a try. However, it sat on the shelf for over a month before actually giving it a go - I was nervous that I wouldn't like it, so kept putting it off (it was the only flavor available when I decided to give it a try). Well, my worry was founded, as I did not care for it at all.<br /><br />The Salmon spread was SUPER FISHY. I love Salmon, and the fresher it is the lighter, more delicate the taste. This hits you over the head with fishiness. The crackers were your basic ritz type crackers and were as expected. There was a granola-ish mix of fruits and nuts that was okay, but seemed sugar sweetened. The dried edamame were indeed dry and not very flavorful. All in all the best item was the little chocolate squares for dessert, but even that wasn't anything I'd purposely seek out when shopping.<br /><br />Perhaps the other GoPicnic meals are better and I was just turned off by the fishiness of this one. I would consider trying a different flavor before completely writing off these little meal packs, and suggest that anyone else considering these meals does so as well (unless you like a strong, fishy taste...)<br /><br />Summary: Great idea, Salmon is super-fishy - try a different flavor meal pack if considering GoPicnic, or just pass it up all together.

review/summary: Adult Lunchable is just okay
review/text: I brought this ready-to-eat meal to work with me yesterday for lunch. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. Nothing was really terrible, rotten, or all that off-putting. It just wasn't good. My friend and I had joked while waiting for this to arrive that it was an "adult lunchable". If you've never had a lunchable, the idea is a little packet of ingredients the kid can put together in his own way, e.g. pizza or cracker sandwiches. They were always very bland and the idea sounded better than it actually tasted. These ended up being exactly the same way.<br />The Late July crackers are tasty (similar to a Ritz), and the salmon spread is alright. I did eat most of it, so it must have been somewhat appealing, though I couldn't tell you how. It was VERY fishy, which I don't mind, though others might.<br />The dry roasted edamame beans are so bland, I can't imagine eating them in any other capacity. Just pure salt and not much other flavor. A bit like eating those styrofoam packing peanuts.<br />The fruit and nut mixture was pretty good, though the number of banana chips was disappointingly low (two in the whole bag). The ginger peanuts were a strange new taste that I couldn't quite get into, but they were tasty.<br />By the time I got to the chocolate I was tired of trying these strangely bland foods. It's dark chocolate. Not much you can screw up there.<br />If you're in a hurry or if you're trying to get your kid to eat better (whole box is 410 calories), these are decent in a pinch. But I'd rather take the extra time to prep my own lunch, or hell, have a lean cuisine.

review/summary: Airplane food for half the price
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by this little meal in a box.  It reminds me of the snack boxes the airlines are selling in place of complimentary frozen entrees these days.  Every items comes individually wrapped with a little fork, but surprisingly no napkins for messy eaters.  However, the airlines would charge $8 or more for this selection.<br /><br />The chili lime salmon spread was surprisingly good.  The appearance is initially off-putting (it looks just like the picture on the box) and there is a fishy odor, which your airplane seat mates might not appreciate.  (Though last time I flew United they were offering a tuna box which was also stinky).  The chili does give the salmon a little kick.  The crackers were good, though I wish they had provided 8 instead of 6 as 5 as not sufficient for the size of the salmon spread serving.<br /><br />The dried roasted edamame was so-so.  Edible, but it won't replace Cheetos as my favorite crunchy snack.<br /><br />The ginger fruit and nut mix was very gingery.  It has bananas in it and I accidently ate one - I don't like bananas.  Other than the bananas the seasoning was good - I nice blend of sweet and salty, with emphasis on the sweet.<br /><br />Also included is a chocolate square.  You can't go wrong with chocolate!<br /><br />Grab one of these things before you head to the airport next time.  Hopefully since everything is sealed TSA will let it through - there are no plastic knives in this package.

review/text: The GoPicnic salmon and crackers, a reasonably-priced meal, is the perfect choice for those looking to watch their calorie intake while eating healthy as well.  The salmon was a bit salty, but that was likely due to the preservatives.  The dried beans were a little bland as well, but would, by themselves, be a perfect snack.  The fruit and nut trail mix was very tasty and among the best pre-packaged trail mix I've had.  The cocoa bar wasn't my favorite, but I'm not generally a fan of chocolate-type snacks.  However, my wife who does like chocolate really enjoyed the bar.<br /><br />Overall, this ready-to-eat meal is a healthy meal for the cost-conscious consumer.

review/text: GOPICNIC is a complete picnic in a box, great for lunches on the go, at a lecture or in the park, during those hot summer afternoons when you dont feel like a big meal, and want to get some sun before lunch hour ends. Also, these wouldnt be bad for camping, or throwing a few in the car for those long vacation trips, when you dont know WHERE you might find a healthy meal on the road. So, whats in the BOX? Chemically, 410 calories (16g fat, 48g carb, 22g protein, with 660mg sodium)that gives you a nice size meal. Add grape juice, or green ice tea, and you're good to go. The CENTERPIECE of the culinary experience is the SALMON SPREAD in a chili lime sauce. ITs not hot, but there is just enough of a bite, in that hot/sour S.E.Asian way, to give the salmon a unusual, complex taste. The GOPICNIC box includes a small plastic fork, to get all the salmon spread out of the container. Also included are buttery wheat "organic" crackers, that dont clash with the salmon taste. (That sauce is remarkable, and literally changes the overtone of the salmon, into elegant seafood cruisine.) Also, you get 1 oz of dry roasted Edamame, which are soybeans. But dont think of those little dried soybeans found in many "trail" mixes, that are so hard you can break a tooth on them. No, the Edamame has the soya protein content, but they're green, fingernail sized, providing a crunchy, but not hard texture. They're very lightly salted. Also, there is this "GINGER ZIP" fruit and nut mix, that compliments the "asian" taste of the salmon sauce, and the Edamame. ALSO, you get a little sweet for desert--a square of dark chocolate, the kind that has all the health benefits. Not a bad picnic lunch at all.

review/summary: An adult, Foodie-worthy step up from the tuna lunch kits out there!
review/text: I'm a regular consumer of Starkist's Chunk Light Tuna Lunch Kits. There's always at least one to three of them sitting in my desk drawer at work. I love the crackers that are packaged with those kits, as well as the individual pouches of condiments that can either be added or omitted from your chosen mixture. But those kits, while about half of the price of these, pale in comparison to this kit, if you're looking for something more adult, more elegant, and more Foodie-friendly.<br /><br />GoPicnic's Salmon + Crackers ready to eat meal comes very smartly packaged, with a small, eco-friendly cardboard box that can be closed securely, with a tab that actually, really stays in place and keeps it closed. The box is rife with information and entertainment, from food product blurbs to fun games meant for adults, as opposed to kids.<br /><br />Also highly adult-friendly are the extra little snacks and treats enclosed with the main dish of salmon "salad" and Ritz-type crackers. The snack mix containing the ginger-glazed peanuts, dried cranberries, and banana chips is sweet, crunchy, and chewy all at once. It's a small pouch of snack mix, and the peanuts ARE rather sweet, but being a BIG fan of ginger, I loved the spicy bite of ginger, and how well they paired with the banana chips and dried cranberries. Definitely a step up from other trail mixes, and delicious. The dry-roasted Edamame are DEFINITELY dry (be sure to keep some sort of drink on hand if you plan to eat these in one sitting - you'll NEED some liquid to choke these all down!), but very tasty, and pretty filling. They hit the spot if you're craving a lightly salted, crunchy, nutty treat, but just remember that they ARE dry!<br /><br />As for the salmon spread itself, don't expect yours to look like what's pictured on the box. At least, mine didn't. It was more of a salmon salad puree' with a few cursory chunks of salmon thrown in to remind you that it really did come from an actual fish. Taste-wise, it was very tasty to me, but DID need the crackers to cut the strong flavor. Salmon DOES have a stronger flavor than tuna salad, which I was aware of already, but I enjoy canned and fresh salmon both, so it wasn't terribly off-putting to me. There was a subtle hint of lime, and the spice of the chili perked it up just enough for me, so overall, the flavors combined well, but I felt compelled to eat the salmon mixture on the Ritz-type crackers, whose buttery, flaky taste were a perfect complement. As for the crackers themselves, they were as good as I'd hoped they'd be, and even better than the ones I've come to enjoy so much from the Starkist tuna lunch kits (an unrelated product, but similar). There were enough of them to get me through the small tray of salmon salad from start to finish, and they smoothed out the more distinctive taste of the salmon salad. For me, it really didn't matter whether they were organic or not, but it's a thoughtful consideration for GoPicnic to have made for their potential customers that WOULD have taken issue with it. The one thing that I think GoPicnic SHOULD swap out here, though, is the plastic fork that came enclosed in my kit - a plastic knife would've been much more helpful, but its omission wasn't a deal-breaker for me.<br /><br />Not being a huge chocolate fan on average, and one who avoids dark chocolate in general, I was very pleasantly surprised by the smooth taste of the dark chocolate square included in this kit. I've grown to expect dark chocolate to be bitter, and this square was not. It had a great snap and crunchy bite, was just sweet enough, and was deliciously smooth and creamy, so I was very, very pleased with it. I can see why the chocolate square enclosed in this kit got rated as the best-tasting organic dark chocolate out there. It was really very, very good.<br /><br />Overall, I found this lunch kit to be more than adequate for me as a lunch option, as opposed to simply a snack. With all of the different components in it, all of the small- to medium-sized portions of items added up to, for me, a very filling lunch. The price is a little higher than I'm used to for my fish salad lunch kits, but the product that you get is definitely worth it. It's a step up all around from what I'd grown accustomed to, and had everything in that small box that I believe most people would want.<br /><br />A delicious product for a good price. High quality ingredients, and plenty of sweet and salty treats to satisfy all around! Good stuff!

review/summary: Fun snack-pack for health-conscious snackers.
review/text: These little snack boxes are cool -- the treats inside are tasty and healthier than many common snack foods and, at around four bucks per box, they're not TOO much more expensive.<br /><br />I previously reviewed a GoPicnic 'care package' which was a much larger box full of a variety of delicious snacks... so I expected the snacks in this little meal box to be similarly tasty --<br /><br />- Chili Lime Salmon Spread: this was pretty good... fairly light-textured and easy to spread. There was enough to cover my...<br /><br />- Organic Crackers: honestly, these tasted like generic Ritz. I like Ritz crackers, so this is a good thing.<br /><br />- Fruit & nut mis: this was good... wish it was larger.<br /><br />- Dry Roasted edamame: this was my personal favorite in the snack box. Sometimes, with dry roasted edamame, I've experienced dryness and/or hardening of the skin-like outer layer of the edamame beans which makes them tough to eat. The edamame in this package didn't have this problem. I'd actually say they were the best dry-roasted edamame I've had.<br /><br />- Chocolate Square -- this was good... not outstanding, just a nice little square of dark (pretty dark!) chocolate.<br /><br />Bottom line -- I think this is a fun and tasty snack box. At 4 bucks, it's not that cheap... but for the quality of components and the supposed healthiness/'all-natural' variety within, I think it's a good choice for health-conscious parents or office workers.

review/summary: Super Convenient and Surprisingly Yummy!
review/text: Wow, this is a delicious light meal or a heavy snack. The products are all high quality and tend toward organic healthier products. The ginger nut/fruit snack was the best mix of that type I've had. The salmon spread was delicious and not too fishy, and I appreciated the fact it had no mayo or icky products added. The crackers are like a ritz cracker but an organic version. The edaname is a dry roasted soybean that is crunchy and tasty. The terra nostra organic chocolate is ridicuously awesome and leaves me wanting to order more of that chocolate. (I just checked and its pretty pricey sold alone online.) As I recall, the amount of protein was high and the sodium wasn't crazy high. I ate this as a lunch and really felt satisfied. Since then, I've purchased the Hummus GoPicnic and its great too. These are just perfect for tossing in a backpack or field trip for for work.

review/text: I have a two year old puggle who devours pretty much everything in his path.  Seriously, I could put a pile of asparagus down and he'll eat it up no problem.  I bought him this blend because we use the Purina Pro Plan adult formula with chicken (and sometimes lamb) and he loves it, eats it right up.  When I put this stuff down he just stares up at me like "what's this?" and yesterday for the first time in HIS LIFE left quite a bit in his bowl.  I'm sorry but I cannot recommend this to anyone.  I feel like I'm forcing my dog to eat cardboard pellets.

review/summary: Good tasting source of fiber Best place to purchase
review/text: I want to preface this review by saying these are not "health food" however they are still the best commercial bar of their type.<br /><br />These are the best tasting fiber bars I have tried.  Better than the Fiber One bars.  Perhaps because these use real chocolate instead of Chikory Root. These bars are also a bit less chewy than Fiber One, something I prefer.  If one really needs to increase their fiber 35% of the daily value in each bar is a good amount for the size of the bar.  Tasting as good as they do also make it an easy way to do so especially with all the chocolate they are much like a candy bar with fiber.  These are my favorite bars of their type.  Amazon has had the best consistent pricing on these vs local stores. If you subscribed to have them delivered every month or two or three, it is your choice, you get an additional 15% discount which is obviously the way to go.  Do watch though as prices may fluctuate and you may find that the deal on the 5 pack version is priced lower or vice versa the 10 pack may be priced lower as is currently the case, however it is for exactly the same number of bars.  If you sign up for the subscription delivery and find that the price has changed or one of the other box sizes is a better value I have changed so that I am getting the same best deal.  Amazon has always been easy to work with so just keep an eye on pricing and call them before being billed when it is about time for your delivery.<br /><br />That said these are not completely health food bars.  I have recently started a fairly strictly healthy diet and am using some things such as cracked Flax seed in my diet to increase fiber.  I still eat these bars a bit like candy from time to time and they are not bad and the best of their type.  There are however even healthier (and less expensive ways) to add fiber to ones diet.  I simply add the seeds to a healthy smoothie or oatmeal which are a major part of my daily diet.<br /><br />But since this is a review about the bars they taste good and have lots of fiber and are priced well here so worth trying and getting here if this is the type of product you are interested in.

review/text: These bars are kind of small, but were a good deal when I bought them. They taste very chocolate, but don't eat more than one or two a day or you'll have stomach issues. If you're looking for a snack food, I'd recommend against these. If you're looking for an occasional snack that you can buy in bulk, this works out pretty well.<br /><br />They are fairly filling and taste good which is good, but you can tell from the ingredients they are fairly processed.

I like how they have fewer (20 less, to be precise) calories than similar bars from the Fiber One company, but they seem to be less...dense, or something. I feel like it's not enough when i'm eating one of these, but when i eat a fiber one bar, i feel much fuller for some reason. They both have the same amount of fiber, though.

review/summary: I love these fiber candy bars!
review/text: These are really terrific little desk drawer treats to satisfy that afternoon chocolate urge without sacrificing a healthy eating plan.  Their 9 grams of fiber, thanks to their inulin from chicory root, is a significant contribution to daily fiber intake.  More than 3 carrots.  In fact as much fiber as 9 large stalks of celery.  120 calories is reasonable for their size and heft. Even though the celery would have more crunch it would lack the critical ingredient -- chocolate!<br />Others have suggested not eating more than 2 in a day, and I concur -- or beware a bit of excess wind.  That serves as a good way to remember not to eat the whole box at a sitting.  I will definitely buy again, as they are in fact a bit addictive.

review/text: I buy this soup at a local grocery store all the time.  It comes with dry noodles, a spice packet, a little packet of dried vegetables and a mystery packet of "soup booster".  The soup booster is a pasty funny looking substance that you add after it has been nuked for 3 minutes.  It looks pretty awful when it comes out of the microwave, but trust me it is good if you like a semi-spicy\ citrusey flavor.  One complaint--Nissin recently reduced the size of the bowl by one ounce and the price has went up here by 22 cents.

review/summary: Too expensive
review/text: I find this to be a good product...good spicy flavor and a quick start to an easy meal.  I have since seen this same product, same quantity at my local Costco for a significant amount less. ($10.00 for a case of 12)  I thought that Amazon was supposed to be a good deal????

review/summary: The Best Mustard
review/text: This has been my favorite mustard for the past 20 years. There simply is nothing like this product. It is outstanding on hamburgers, steaks, sandwiches...<br /><br />There is a hint of mustard heat, but this is not a Dijon style mustard. Those 11 herbs blend together to soften and make the mustard much more complex. There's no sharp vinegar flavor like with prepared mustards (better known as French's).<br /><br />It is simply heaven with a really nice steak. I love this product, only wish it came in much larger jars.

review/summary: A well condimented product
review/text: With Amora Savora you get 11 spices in just one condiment. I knew the product and I was surprised to find it offered for sale at Amazon.com. It is a great way to add more flavor to almost any food. It is a bit milder than mustard alone and you get a better nutritional value with its 11 spices.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I bought this looking for a mustard I had in a restaurant. It was not what I was seeking but what a happy accident. This is a lovely condiment. I use it a lot, not just for a sandwich. I covered a pork tenderloin in this and then rolled it in chopped fresh herbs, nestled it into a baguette, tied it up and put it into a 350F oven for 35 minutes. Delicious

review/text: The items being sold here are "samples".  It clearly says "not to be sold" on the can.  It is illegal to sell this item.  I hope nobody else falls for this scam by this P.O.S..

review/summary: Even at cheap, you don't get what you expect.
review/text: I got this as a joke gift for Christmas to the entire family.  Having previously spent $10 on 1 pound reeses peanut butter cups I thought this was a way to 1-up myself.<br /><br />It was on sale for ~$22, which I would pay no more for honestly.  It arrived a day early!  I was surprised as it would have been close for christmas but arrived with enough time for me to inspect it and wrap it.<br /><br />I opened the box and slid it out, very large impressive chocolate bar.  Have not tasted yet but I assume will taste like good chocolate.<br /><br />HOWEVER:  ARRIVED BROKEN INTO 6+ triangles.  If you order this you can pretty much guarantee it will arrive broken.  Guaranteed broken into small pieces.  However I am passing it off as a joke and would've passed pieces to everyone, but the impressive image is far less impressive when its a bunch of pieces.<br /><br />I enjoy this purchase just because I was able to cross 6 people off my gift list with a massive cheap bar, but if you expect it whole like the pictures you are sadly mistaken.

review/summary: Add me to the broken list
review/text: Its unfair to rate chocolate I have not tried yet so I am really only commenting on the condition for which it arrived. Not on the taste.<br /><br />As it seems others have suffered the same fate, 5LBS of chocolate unsecured in a large box with no packing materials is no match for the Holiday Postal Rush. The real problem was it was a Holiday purchase, so now I am scrambling to find a suitable replacement. I thought about gifting it anyway and blaming a small child or a disgruntled postal worker but in reality Amazon should have used the care they usually use when sending a book or video and cellophane it to the cardboard. So while Amazon quite possibly saved my friend from Diabetes ... it put me in position of finding another gift with only days to spare.

review/text: It's broken into several pieces as received. Since it does not look good any more, there is no way to send it as a gift.

review/summary: Lucky
review/text: I guess I was one of the lucky ones. When these went on sale for about a third of their usual price, I picked one up as a gift for my chocoholic wife. Thankfully, hers arrived in one piece, but didn't stay that way for long. Every stop we made over the holidays, a little more was broken off and everyone loved it. There's so much chocolate here that we're into February now and there's still a little left. A great bar of chocolate if you can get it at the right price.
