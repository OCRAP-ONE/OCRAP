review/summary: Another great bar for 'nut' fans!
review/text: Do you like mixed nuts? You'll love this bar. I have always liked Nature valeey trail mix bars. This one is no exception. Nice taste of raisins and nuts mixed with a chewy trail mix bar. I take them with me during my bike rides. A bottle of gatorade and two of these bars keeps me going.

review/summary: Good Product
review/text: I enjoy these bars, they make a nice snack. They taste great and are not as high in calories/fat/carbohydrates as a candy bar. You can feel good about snacking on these instead, and the kids like them too. I keep one in my purse just in case I need to eat and the only thing available is a vending machine. These also stay with you longer for some reason.

review/summary: Run Of The Mill Trail Mix Bars
review/text: I shared a box of these with my family and though we all enjoyed them, we uniformly thought they were about as good as the other brands. I.E they were very good quality, quite filling for a small serving and reasonably tasty but nothing really stood out about them.<br />I thought they were a little bit drier than other similar bars but satisfying and still chewy enough for my tastes!<br />Bottom line, they don't stand out from the crowd but are still good value, great quality and I would buy these anytime!

review/text: Boy these are good. Chewy with no stickyness on your fingers this is the right combination for a fruit & nut bar. Holds together well while your eating it while not being too seeet on your toungue. Also seems to have a nice mix ratio of nuts to dried fruit in the bar. What can I say other than these bars are yummy. I gave a few to friends & they agreed with me. While they make a good stack bar you can also pack them with your lunch or use them for dessert. I'm going to be buying some of these after my sample pack of 12 bard runs out.

review/summary: Like granola bars? You'll prob like these.
review/text: The are great granola bars. I've bought them for a long time and continue to love them. The almonds in them are a great touch, and they're sweetened by dried cranberries. There's also enough there to make it filling for a small snack.<br /><br />Consistency-wise, they are a bit sticky. I usually hold them with the wrapper when I eat them. They are definitely chewy (especially as compare to the Nature Valley crunchy granola bars, which are really, really crunchy), but because of all the nuts and crispy things, they're still a bit crispy. I like the consistency and have no prob with it as others have said they do. I also don't find them too crazy sweet (I tend not to like super-sweet things). The nuts and slight bitterness of the cranberries balance it all out for me.<br /><br />Again, I've always loved these granola bars. Give them a try.

review/summary: Slightly healthier than a candy bar
review/text: While this product contains "a mix of three different kinds of nuts and seeds, almonds, and rolled oats" it it hardly a healthy product, containing, as it does, five different kinds of sweeteners.  As others have observed, the bars are sticky, so not for someone with fragile dental work.  At 140 calories, they constitute a nice snack, probably slightly better for you than a candy bar.  Actual "trail mix", with the nuts, dried fruit of your choice, is probably a better choice, but for the likelihood of eating many more than 140 calories at once.

review/summary: Tasty and better for you than a candy bar, but...
review/text: These are an excellent substitute for a candy bar or a cookie--- they have protein and fiber, and the good stuff like anti-oxidants that come along with the whole plant foods they're made of. They taste pretty good, have nice crunchy nuts, won't crumb all over your car or shirtfront, and aren't so chewy your jaw aches and you worry about your dental work--in fact, they are not overly chewy at all--more soft and slightly gooey--just enough to stick the stuff together-- than chewy like caramel. They also have about two thirds of the calories of a regular candy bar, but with the fiber and protein, may well keep you satisfied at least as long!<br /><br />They do have quite a bit of sugar compared with the healthier snacks dietitians love, like peanut butter on whole wheat crackers (although for 140 calories, you wouldn't get much of those), or an apple and a piece of string cheese (again, more calories, but probably better for you). For shelf-stable, portable, grab-and-go, these are pretty healthy, all things considered.

review/summary: Not for the real health conscious
review/text: This is the sort of bar that you would find in the grocery store. Nature Valley is a General Mills product.  Very average, and you wouldn't expect much from it.  The second ingredient (to whole grain oats) is high maltose corn syrup.  Not an optimal ingredient, as we are learning.  The other ingredients are eh, so so.  They taste fine, a bit sweet, but edible.  There are 3 grams of protein in each bar, 140 calories, and each bar weighs 1.2 ounces.  That is about 4 bites worth for most adults, probably average for these kinds of "grocery store" bars.  On the plus side, if you are need something that doesn't melt; chocolate coatings, etc. this would work for you.

review/summary: Nature Valley Trail Mix Bars
review/text: These bars are very tasty and the almonds and fruit are solid whole pieces.  These things are very chewy.  I can't imagine someone with dentures trying to eat one.  I have TMJ and can't chew gum for very long until it hurts my jaws, these things cause my jaw to be a little sore after eating.  The ingredients list honey and it appears the whole bar is dipped and dried in it.<br /><br />I had one and it seems like someone else in my house liked them.  Three days later they were gone.  If you have a tough jaw (or if chew gum doesn't bother you) then you will like these.  Like I said, they are very tasty, but very chewy.

review/summary: Love these bars!
review/text: Nature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bars are a fruit & nut lover's delight!  I especially like the dates and almonds.  Yummy!  And, the bar is only 140 calories to boot!  The peanuts and cranberrys seem to be lightly included, but the amount of sweetness is just right!  Only 1g of fiber, so it definitely is not a good source for that.  If you want a crewy, delicious bar which can serve as an in-between meal treat and love dates and almonds, you will love these bars, too. Nature Valley states these bars are 100% natural.  I know only that they taste great!

review/summary: Typical, but decent snack bar
review/text: The Nature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bar (Fruit and Nut variety) is a typical, but decent entry in the world of snack bars.  There a a few traces of raisins and cranberries in the bar, but it is dominated by oats (as expected) and rice, with a few bits of almonds and peanuts thrown in.  At least in my samples, I was surprised to see more sunflower seeds in the mix than nuts, but it not enough to detract from the product.  And as advertised, the bar is chewy, but luckily not sticky or overly sweet.<br /><br />I'm having a hard time coming up with a word that describes the taste of the bar other than "typical."  There is not enough of any one product, either fruit or nut or sunflower seed, to change the taste from that of the oats, rice, and honey that make up a majority of the product.  And as noted above, the honey used to hold the bar does not make the product overly sweet.  In this case "typical" isn't a bad thing, it just keeps me from giving the highest rating to the product.<br /><br />Overall, an acceptable product with a pleasant but not-quite-memorable taste.

review/text: I frequently buy Nature Valley products, especially the Oats and Honey granola bars, so I knew that I would like this bar before I even tried it. I was not disappointed. It was very moist and chewy and had a delicious flavor of all of the nuts. The cranberries and raisins were a nice touch, with the cranberries giving a nice tart experience with the sweet of the raisins. Lovers of granola bars will enjoy this one. I will definately purchase again.

review/text: I was not a big fan of Nature Valley's healthy granola type bars, but this new bar is very different from their other products. It has a lot of fruit and it's comparable to the more expensive well known brands. It's still a bit too sweet but not overwhelming like their other products. I think this product and I think it is a great buy for the price.

review/summary: sweet and chewy, but largely empty carbohydrates
review/text: The good news is that these bars taste good and have a pleasing texture.  They don't have a lot of calories -- just 140 per bar -- but the bar is on the small side.<br /><br />I doubt I would order these again, despite them being enjoyable to eat.  The problem is that there just isn't much nutrition in these bars beyond the carbohydrates (sugars).  Only 3 grams of protein and 1 gram of fiber per bar.  As long as you understand that you're going to be eating something that derives over 70% of its calories from carbs, you might enjoy this snack.  I would recommend a more protein dense bar, however.

review/text: We definitely enjoyed these trail mix bars.  My favorite are the sweet & salty ones, but these were definitely better than your average hard and flaky granola bar.  Much more like the fancy ones at the health food store.<br /><br />It's got mostly healthy, good ingredients to it, though I don't know what high maltose corn syrup is...  sounds like a slight variation of high fructose corn syrup, and probably just as unhealthy.

review/text: I am a big fan of the Nature Valley granola bars so I was anxious to try these.  I have to say I have a new favorite!  The granola bars are very hard and brittle, I end of with little bits all over me when I finish one.  With the chewy trail mix this isn't a problem and the flavor of the fruit and nuts is great.  I will be buying these from now on for that quick snack on the run.

review/summary: Great, nutritional snack
review/text: This is a tasty and convenient snack to carry along. I usually bring these with me when I go golfing. Each bar contains 25 grams of carbs, so avoid these if you are on a low carb diet. If you want fiber, then you should probably try one of the fiber-enriched bars, as these contain only 1 gram of fiber. But each bar does have a nice assortment of nuts; almonds, peanuts and sunflower.<br /><br />Coincidentally, I received these from Amazon on Earth Day, and was therefore a little more conscious of how these are packaged. You could easily fit at least two more bars in the box. But we all know the manufacturer wants it to appear that you are getting more than you really are, hence the bigger box.<br /><br />Worth a try!

review/summary: Tasty - but LOTS of sugar!
review/text: I echo many of the other reviews...these bars are tasty, nutty, and very chewy.  But if you're looking for a healthy bar, keep looking.  They pack 25g of carbs, and the first few ingredients (right after the whole grain oats) are: corn syrup (sugar!), crisp rice (which contains..sugar), then  and then malt extract (which a google search defines as "thick syrup containing SUGARS, vitamins, and minerals," then just plain old sugar, and as you scan down the ingredients further there's honey and sucrose.  It gives me a sugar buzz just writing about it!<br /><br />By contrast, Kashi's Trail Mix chewy granola bars contain only 6g of sugars (vs this product's 14g!) and have double the protein.  If you're looking for a healthy, tasty granola bar, I suggest you check out the Kashi bars.  If you're looking for something that's just almost a candy bar, you'll find this product tasty and to your liking.

review/summary: Tastes good but too high in sugar
review/text: This is in the category of the pseudo granola bars that are closer to a candy bar than a health food.  Sort of like sports drinks are more like a soda than a truly healthful drink.  If you're ok with that, then flavor-wise, this is a good tasting bar.  But if you are looking for something healthful, this isn't it.  Look for a granola bar that has protein and fiber content (in grams) about equal to the sugar content; for instance the Kashi TLC bars fit this (about 5g of each).  By contrast, this bar has 13g sugar, 1g fiber, 3g protein.

review/summary: Trail Mix in a Bar
review/text: Nature Valley makes great stuff, especially the Trail Mix Bar with both fruit and nuts. Besides almonds, raisins, peanuts they have cranberries...  A source of energy for my healthy body - this stuff is really chewy, even at 140 calories per. Bottom line: lotsa nuts,fruit,and whole oats.  The bars are sticky especially after sitting in a "hot" mailbox at 101 degree Phoenix temp today. Eat them as pre-meal snack.

review/text: The timing for receiving this product was great because I got home at 1:30 and needed a tideover until dinner.  Watching my weight, I'm counting calories and am not concerned at all about whether the product is pristinely healthy for me.  Nature Valley is a good brand overall in this respect, but I'm more concerned about what the product tastes like and whether it satisfies.  Here are my findings; it's mildly chewy, kind of sticky, has some real nuts and raisins but mostly rice/granola, subdued taste, and a filling 140 calories.  It did not particularly remind me of trail mix.  Cost wise, because I'm also watching my budget, I will be keeping the price per bar at $1 or less.

review/summary: Keep in the refrigerator
review/text: I always keep a box of these bars in my refrigerator.<br /><br /> If I had never seen the Fruit and Nut bars before, one look at the label would tell me that they are not particularly healthful.  The ingredients include corn syrup, honey, and sugar listed twice.  In fact, there are 14 grams of sugar in every 34 gram bar.  That is forty percent!  Although the label does claim all natural ingredients, that does not necessarily mean that the contents are all good for you.<br /><br /> The sugar seems to be what holds the fruit and nuts together.  The reason that I keep them in the refrigerator is that when the bars get warm, they do not hold their shape.  You do not want to put one in your pocket on a warm day.  They become a sticky blob.<br /><br /> So why do I keep a big supply of them around?  I like them.  When cooled, they keep their shape as a crunchy rectangle of nuts and fruit.  Their nutty texture is very nice.  The taste is great, although the sugar does make its presence known.  I do not eat them every day or take them with me to go hiking.  For that, I like the Oats and Honey, Almond, or Peanut Butter varieties of Nature Valley granola bars.  Those varieties have a more reasonable sugar content.  However, I like a Fruit and Nut bar as an occasional treat to go with tea or coffee.  Maybe I am addicted to them.

When they arrived, I ripped the box open, pulled out a bar and got myself good and cozy.  I slowly started peeling the wrapper open and wondered what I'd gotten myself into.  It looked pretty sticky, and maybe a little bit hard, and I was a little afraid it might mess up my dental work.  But it was so tempting!  I bit gently into it and it was sort of like a Rice Krispies treat, then the oats kicked in, and I got some chewing going on.  Then, ooh, I tasted raisin - just like a chewy cookie, but the next thing I knew I got a little almond crunch going on, and my teeth were fine, and everything was just groovy.  Mmm, I thought, then I got a bit of cranberry; now this was getting a little intense.  No turning back now, take another bite and oh, yum, it went all peanut-y on me and I was in love.  Then suddenly it was over.  The bar was gone.  I'd eaten it all!  And I wanted more.  Yeah, I want more.

review/summary: filling but not tasty
review/text: Well, it's filling, and fairly low-calorie at 140 for the bar. I had high hopes for this bar, given the promise of fruit and nuts, which is reinforced by the packaging that prominently features pictures of raisins, almonds, peanuts and cranberries. Opening the package is the first of the disappointments. The primary ingredient is oats, followed closely by corn syrup. Tiny specks of cranberry, raisin and almond, with a few peanut chunks. The flavor is very sweet with a bitter aftertaste. This is not a product I would recommend or choose to purchase.

review/summary: My Candy Dream Come True
review/text: Gummy Sweet Tarts Bugs is my favorite candy ever! This is the hardest candy to find ever. With amazon.com, I was able to be reunited with my favorite candy, which made me extremely happy! The delivery actually came early. The candy is packed neatly in a box. They're not just thrown inside the box. They're stacked in neat piles. I was scared that since the appearance cover of the bag was different that this wasn't the type I wanted. But when I opened the bag and put the candy in my mouth, I knew I was in heaven! My favorite candy in the whole wide world tasted so rejuvenatingly yummy! All thanks to amazon.com! Thank you thank you thank you!

review/summary: I'm a fan.  Get your citrus here.
review/text: It took me a while to warm up to the idea of buying freeze dried fruit in individual serving bags.  Brothers helped me overcome that.  The fruit needs to be in the individual packaging to keep the humidity out so they stay crisp.  I found the mandarin orange crisps delightful.  The texture of freeze dried fruit in general takes a little time to get used to.  These are sort of like a cheese puff in mouth feel, but entirely different in taste.  They explode with a sweet/ tart flavor.<br /><br />If you buy fresh fruit and it spoils before you eat it, or if you run out and need an alternative to canned or frozen fruit, this is a great alternative.  Price an orange some time.  While these cost more than a piece of fresh fruit, they are not too far off.  Don't let the price per ounce fool you.  You are not paying for the water content that makes up most of the weight of fresh. Compare by serving size.  Grab a glass of tap water and a bag of these and you're on.  I also like the pineapple, cinnamon apple and banana flavors.  The berry flavors have a seed problem in my opinion so I skip them.

review/text: These are definitely more tart than many of Brothers All Natural snacks (barring pineapple, which I have not tried), but not overly so. I'm not a tart/sour lover, so many of the reviews that I have read put me off. My son loves all foods, though, so I figured I'd buy a box and try them. They do seem to be a love or hate product - one that I personally LOVE. Instant win for me. My son also loves them, but my husband does not. The texture is incredible and unlike any other freeze-dried snack I've ever had. Each bag contains approximately 2 mandarin oranges, is only 35 calories, and provides enough crunch to satisfy that mid-afternoon longing for the vending machine. I only wish our vending company provided these!

review/summary: WOW....crispy oranges !!!
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect, but I love mandarin oranges, so decided to take a chance.  I'm SO glad I did.  These are whole segments of oranges, freeze dried into a light, crispy fruit snack.  The orange flavor is excellent, and the texture is a nice change from regular fruit, for snacks. Each individual bag has 2 fruit servings, but only 38 calories, 6 gms of sugars, and 1 gram of fiber. Great for a diabetic food plan, and general snacking.  I will definitely be ordering these again.  I may combine several of the Brothers' fruit crisps to make a dried fruit salad- mandarin oranges and bananas sound really good :)

review/text: These are one of my favorite snacks, though I'm alone in my family in loving them...though they love other Brothers fruit snacks that we purchase.  The mandarin orange crisps are delightfully sweet and tart, rather like candies labeled "sour".  They are very slightly chewy, and my only complaint is that after eating the larger sections, they sometimes leave a lot of small remnants, almost fluff, in the bag.  No big problem, I dump them in my hand and eat them, too--a bit messy, but good!

I talked myself into thinking that maybe it's an acquired taste, but finishing my first pouch is turning out to be way too difficult. What a waste of money!! I can't even hand these out to people because I'm sue that no one will want them. Yes, they're that bad.<br />I hope I can use these to make some sort of citrus tea or other drink, or maybe even toss in my salads. I don't know, we'll see. I'm just really disappointed.

review/text: I like this so much, I signed up for autoshipping every three months.  The 3-bag bulk package is much cheaper than buying the 7-oz. cups.  As a diabetic, I really enjoy having something sweet that does not spike my blood sugar.  I grew up loving black licorice.  (If it is not black, it is not licorice.)  Of course, like everything else sweetened with maltitol, it must be taken in moderation to avoid uncomfortable gas or a laxative effect.  Never eat it on an empty stomach, and be prepared to get this chewy candy stuck in your teeth.

review/text: I just got these in the mail, and ripped into them anxious to try some licorice.  I finally decided on these after the reviews I read.  The texture is nice and chewy.... not to soft.  The Taste is nasty though.  Almost bitter.  It is like licorice, but there is this very overpowering bitter wierd taste.  It stays in your mouth and you have to eat something else to make the taste go away.  I even tried several pieces hoping it was something that would get better.... it did not!  I gave some to my children, who said no more thank you after the first bear.  One spit it in the trash.  Dissapointed since I now have 6+ pounds of this mess.  Wish they had a smaller option to try first.  I would recommend the regular fruit flavored sugar free bears.  they taste just like the full sugar bears.

review/text: Kraepelian & Holm sugar free licorice bears are my most recent purchase in the search for a quality licorice candy.  I am very happy with this one.  Nice licorice taste, not overbearing, chewy enough (as opposed to too hard) and I couldn't tell that it was sugar free as it has no nasty after taste. I haven't had any adverse effects from them, but every buyer who purchases sugar free candy has to be aware of how well their system tolerates these sweeteners. It was worth the purchase.

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

Liked them so much that I have ordered these again and have also decided to try the ginger ones too.

review/summary: Great holdover snack
review/text: These cookies are high in fiber and make a great holdover snack in-between meals. Like Nana's other cookies, these are not very sweet. The part I like best are the walnuts that are mixed providing a sublte crunch in these otherwise soft cookie.

review/summary: The best cookie and a great breakfast treat.
review/text: This big, delicious, moist and chewy cookie fits the bill for a great on-the-go breakfast or travel meal. Note that one serving is half a cookie, which would be plenty as a dessert or snack. But a whole cookie makes a meal, and is very filling.<br />Read the ingredient list carefully and you will see one *important* difference between this brand and other "healthy" cookie or pastry-bar type treats: (organic) WHOLE wheat flour. Not "wheat flour", which is the same as white flour, and has no nutritional value.<br />Another plus is that even the chocolate chips in the cookie are sweetened with low-glycemic malted barley, not cane sugar.<br />I'm looking forward to trying more varieties of Nana's cookies.

review/summary: Best cookie I've ever tasted
review/text: As a newly converted vegan, there's not a lotta sweet food items I can eat that doesn't have milk or some type of milk product or animal product in it (not to mention refined sugars and bleached flours etc). I've tried Alternative Baking Company's double chocolate cookie, which I loved, but per cookie they charge $2 a piece. I searched for another company that makes a similar cookie, and found this company (Nana's). The cookie is every bit as good as  the ABC's cookie, and a lot cheaper at that. Hands down the best cookie I've ever eaten. For any vegans or anyone looking to decrease their sugar intake, this is definitely worth trying.

review/text: Although I love the Nana's brownie mint, and peanut butter flavor cookies, I found the ginger cookie disappointing.  It was too spicy to be enjoyable, and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors.  (The crumbliness is due to the gluten-free rice flour.)<br /><br />Also, the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors I've had:  360 calories per cookie, compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories.<br /><br />Note that Nana's cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving, but they count a serving size as half a cookie.

Yes, they contain no wheat, but instead, they have barley flour. Wheat, barley and rye all have natural gluten and *must* be avoided. Do not buy these if you have Celiac disease -- that is, are gluten intolerant.<br /><br />Amazon should fix their search engine to NEVER display products that are not truly gluten free when people search for such. Even now, on the review form, Amazon is suggesting "gluten free" and "celiac" as tags for this product. That is flat out false.

Being that most products that are gluten free are a bit pricey, these reviews help weigh out rather to try the product itself. So please if you don't have any tolences ...please state it... because you have more choices than us that do not.

review/text: Love these cookies. They taste wonderful. No trans fat, vegan, Kosher, healthy ingredients. So what's my gripe? If you look at the nutrition label on the back of the cookie package carefully, notice that a serving is 1/2 a cookie. And, 1/2 a cookie is 210 calories (different from the info on the Amazon site, but I'm looking at the package right now -- same product, current package). So, if you eat the whole cookie (I dare you to stop at 1/2. I know I can't! I tried.), you've eaten a 420-calorie cookie. Wow. That's a lot. Sorry to burst the bubble. I take one of these to work every once in awhile to eat for lunch (and 420 calories is a large lunch for me), but that's the only way I can eat them. I bought these not realizing they'd counted the cookie as two servings (which is pretty sneaky, IMO), and relied on the Amazon site info, which needs to be updated to reflect current package count. Great cookies, but if calories factor in for you, beware.

I have a feeling the person who gave these 1 star is someone who can eat a freakin' cinnabon if she wants to.  For those of us who have dietary restrictions, it's a different story.<br /><br />It does take a while to get used to gluten free fare, but these cookies are among the best I've had, which is pretty impressive since they don't even have sugar in them.  And the fact that they don't have gluten, eggs, nuts, or dairy in them either is wonderful (yes, there are those of us out there allergic to all these things).  I just wish more stores carried them.  But now that I've found them on Amazon, I'll be ordering in bulk. ;)

review/summary: Love this healthy cookie!
review/text: I am very salt sensitive and search to find helathy low sodium products.  On a recent trip to San Diego, I happened to find Nana's Oatmeal sunflower cookies.  It is a meal in a cookie!  It tastes good, moist and wholesome and very filling.  I have ordered a large quantity and carry some with me, so I always have something to eat when I can't find low sodium food.  Routinely, I eat one a day along with a serving of fruit, either for breakfast or lunch. It has been a wonderful find!!
