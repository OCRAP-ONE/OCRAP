review/text: I have gotten this flavor of slim jim before from amazon and loved it however this order tasted like salty cardboard! Expiration date of march 08 but these must have been stored improperly because they are nasty. I guess with amazon your rolling the dice when you order snacks. Sometimes they are good and sometimes they really really bad. Good luck to all who are brave enough to gamble their $$$

review/text: I got one of those $25 gift certificate in the mail, and couldn't decide what to blow it on.  This was great.  I had, like, one Slim Jim a day for almost an entire month.  And they were the Tabasco flavored ones -- my favorite.<br /><br />If you've had a Tabasco Slim Jim before, well, you know what you're getting.  It's pretty clear.  If you haven't, well, maybe you should try one before you think about ordering two dozen.

review/text: White trash, indeed. The Slim Jims of the same size in the canisters were great - salty, dry, chewy - the way I like my pepperoni stick snacks.  These were moister and almost gross.  I'm hoping I can get rid of them when friends come to visit, drink beer, and watch football, but I'm not eating any of these.  Probably just as well.  I won't reorder this box.

review/summary: Kids Love Them
review/text: I have ordered these on numerous occasions because the kids love them.  The sticks are a little small, but they allow you to eat four (serving size 4 pieces) with 160 calories.  The fat is a different matter - 1g of trans fat and 6g of saturated fat - 14 total grams of fat per serving.  Obviously not a great health choice if you are going to go through the box in one sitting.  That having been said, they taste great and sometimes are the only thing that hits the spot when you are craving a salty meaty snack.  We throw one in to our youngest kid's lunch box and it makes her day.

review/text: The first one I bit into was tough as leather and I had to rip it with my teeth. I made the mistake of biting it in half, and then I chewed, and chewed, and chewed. I couldn't get it to break down - it was like chewing gum! For the next one, I tried stripping off the outside, but that didn't make any difference. Still tough. I found they were easier to eat if I took tiny bites.<br /><br />That said, they were very tasty. But I don't like to fight my food, so I won't be buying this little stick any more.

review/summary: If you like Slim Jims and/or Tabasco, then these babies are fantastic. Hot, but delicious. A+!!!
review/text: This review is in reference to the 18 count pack of Tabasco flavored Monster Slim Jim's, although any size of the Tabasco Slim Jims are GREAT. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQE3HS">Slim Jim Giant Smoked Snacks, Tabasco, 0.97-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 24)</a>)<br /><br />  I love Tabasco sauce, and love the amazing synergy products they have made with other companies. So when I saw Tabasco Slim Jims, being a fan of Slim Jims anyway, I had to try them. The smaller sized ones, which I have been unable to find here on Amazon, taste great, but they are somewhat tougher than the larger versions, though not in a bad way. The medium sized and large ones, which this review is about, are much softer. Regardless, they are ALL delicious. They have the same spicy flavor that we Tabasco lovers have come to crave, but at the same time, since it was mixed in with other ingredients, it isn't so hot that you are forced to stop eating no matter how good it tastes. My friends and I all agree that it does have a high heat factor to it, and people who don't like spicy stuff might find it too much. But if you like spicy foods, these are an AMAZING snack. If you haven't tried them, then I highly recommend you get one from your grocery or convenient store. If you like them, buy them here since they are cheaper in bulk. Fans of Tabasco will not be disappointed. That's my $.02 on the matter folks.<br /><br />  Thanks you so much for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell

review/text: this is the second time I have ordered these from the same seller (Amazon as it gives free shipping). The first time the slim jims were moist and plump and oily and you could tell they were fresh. This second batch was hard and dried out and not oily at all. For those who like slim jims you know what I mean about them being plump and oily as opposed to hard and dried out without much oil.<br /><br />This is the ONLY place I can get the HOT ones so I was dissappointed with the second batch, while the first batch was perfect! I will continue to buy these but may see baout buying from a different seller to get fresher ones.

Not something I would eat daily, but a "good" treat if you like them.  With the sales lately amazon has had on them, the price is right as well.

review/summary: Low carb, spicy snack sticks
review/text: I've loved Slim Jims since I was a kid in the 70s, and these are just the way I remember them - a little greasy, chewy, a little spicy.  This box of 100 contains the small sized sticks - about 4 inches long, individually wrapped, and stored in a dispenser box.  They don't have to be refrigerated, which makes them easy to tuck into a purse or lunch box.<br /><br />These aren't the "spicy" flavor - I think you have to order the jalapeno or tabasco flavor to get those.  But these are *slightly* spicy, chewy and delicious.  Nobody eats Slim Jims because they're health food - they contain preservatives and low grade meats.  But for a quick snack or if you just want something spicy, these are the same yummy snacks you'll remember from your childhood.  They are also high protein and zero carbs, which is good for those who are dieting.<br /><br />I've ordered this box three times and have been happy with it every time.  Free shipping with Amazon's Supersaver Shipping makes it a good deal.  And if you sign up for automatic delivery (no obligation to keep getting it past the first shipment) you will save an additional 15%, making each stick about 20 cents apiece.

They make a good between meal snack and the .28 ounce size works well.  I suppose you either like the taste or not.  I like the spiciness as compared to Jack Links, but the texture (finely ground and extruded into a stick) seems a bit less like real meat.  All in all, a good product.

review/text: Good price for these Slim Jims.  100 count box will be great for the purpose I have in mind.  We donate to a local group that sends care packages to our troops overseas and this will give them all at least one.  I'm always on the lookout for quantity and quality such as this.

review/summary: Delicioso!
review/text: I originally bought these for myself to relive the nostalgia of consuming one of my favorite snacks of the 90's (R.I.P. Randy Savage). Little did I know how fast the box would run out, these are a huge hit when we have friends and family over. Each jerky stick is roughly a bite size version of the huge sticks you see at your local kwik-e-mart, and 100 sounds like a lot but it isn't - I find myself having to buy these nearly once a month.

review/text: Having never ordered food online before, I was a little leery. However, I decided to take the leap as my husband's birthday was approaching and Slim Jim's are one of his favorites. The cost was no more than buying at a brick and mortar store and the product arrived with excellent freshness. The handy box they come in make for neat storage in the pantry. Not a downside to be had! I would definitely buy again.

review/summary: This Will Put You In A COMA!
review/text: This hot sauce is not hot sauce... it is heat incarnate.  I didn't even use a "bullet-spoon" serving, I just dipped the tip of a toothpick in the sauce and stirred it around in a plate of beans thinking it wouldn't really do anything.  I was freaking wrong.  This junk is by far the hottest sauce I've EVER tasted and I am a hot sauce junkie.  Here are a few tips if you're going to use this stuff:  1) ALWAYS WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER HANDLING THIS PRODUCT!!! I learned the hard way.  2) Don't try to be a hero.  There are serious health risks if you attempt to consume this product in large quantities.  3) If you are going to prank someone... make sure you don't go too far with it because this stuff is seriously painful even in small quantities.<br /><br />If you think you can handle it... prepare for tears and a very abrupt halt to your ego-trip.  This is the god of sauces and it commands you to respect it.

review/text: We had previously purchased these at a discount store and loved them. These were included in gifts and when we didn't hear from the recipients we tried our remaining bag. The peanuts had a VERY old taste. We asked others and they all had the same response. I don't know what happened, perhaps an old supply? The price was a bit more than I had wished to spend but our previous experience had led me to believe they would be worth it... We were very disappointed and didn't know who we should contact. Amazon or the company directly.<br /><br />Just contacted the Ferdies company and they were EXTREMELY helpful! Apparently the code on the bag shows that these were past their expiration date. (Amazon should not have shipped these.) I am happy again, now to convince everyone to try them again!

review/text: I have the most sensitive dogs.  Both my Shepherds, Belgium and German, are quick to have diarrhea.  I've tried Iams, Science Diet, Bill Jack, you name it we have tried it.<br />Finally, my breeder suggested the Nature's Variety dried dog food which left my dogs still a little inconsistent. Then, I found a store in town that carried the freeze-dried small bits. Wow! what a difference it has made.  I add 5 nuggets, which are the size of a large cookie dough ball, to some Royal Canine German Shepherd dried dog food and Voila.  We have not had ONE incident of diarrhea since.  Venison and lamb are their favorites.  They are also the perfect size to hide a pill.  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: my Pyr loves this
review/text: I have a pyranese and a pyr/wolf mix about 270 lbs of dog between the two and they get picky about their food.  I've tried to save money and feed them science diet or iams but especially my pyr she lost hair by the handfuls and her stool got runny. So I bit the bullet and went back to instinct. What a difference their hair is gorgeous, when we go out (my pyr is my service dog) she gets so much attention and people can't help but pet her she's so soft.  What I do is feed her the chicken instinct dry dog food and I sprinkle the freeze dried raw food on top in various flavors to keep them interested, and It's very handy to take with me when we are out and about as a snack, treat or a meal if we can't get home in time (I don't feed them "people" food at all because of their training) ...since both are large breeds there is the concern of bloat if they eat cheap or the wrong food, with instinct I don't worry about it at all, my vet says both are perfect weight and very healthy.  And another thing with instinct is that you need to feed your dog a lot less food because of the high quality, so this is not the food you want to free feed your dog or they will put on weight rather quickly....I love this stuff and more importantly my dogs (my right and left hand) love it too.

review/text: Spice Appeal is a great company for Latin spices and seasonings (probably great for other things, but I haven't tried them). This 80 ounce jar of New Mexican chili powder has a great deep chili flavor. It also provides a great deep color for your sauces, chili, tacos, fajitas, etc. This is not an all-in-one chili seasoning as the other confused reviewer seemed to think. Add some onion, garlic, cumin and salt and it will cover that job very nicely. It is somewhere between mild and medium, heat wise and again, has a very nice flavor.

I also would like to know what person gave the okay to release this to a market, cause they have clearly had a major loss of taste buds.<br /><br />Horrible. Not cheesy at all. Kinda watery.<br /><br />I had two tastes--the second to make sure I wasn't imagining the awfulness--and then tossed the jar away.<br /><br />Dang.<br /><br />The bean dip also sucked, so with Arriba!, I'll just stick to the salsa when I am too lazy to make fresh.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: Gross Beyond Words
review/text: This was one of those "oops" situations that can happen occasionally.<br /><br />The package of three jars arrived, and seemed to have stains on the outer box. When I opened the box and saw the inner, bubble-wrapped package, I understood.<br /><br />Two of the three jars had popped their lids, and the contents had leaked out. That had, apparently, happened long before the package was shipped, as there was mold growing all over the interior, on the leaking sauce, and on the jars. It was a mess.<br /><br />This couldn't have happened just during shipping, so my assumption is that the package had sat for quite a while in a hot warehouse. Whatever the cause, there was no way I was going to use the product, and it wasn't practical to repackage it to return it.<br /><br />As usual, Amazon came to the rescue. I called and described the problem , offering to send photos of the opened box and interior package. The Amazon rep agreed with me that it would be pointless to try returning the disaster to them, so he offered a simple, full refund.<br /><br />If uncorrupted, the Con Queso is probably good stuff; I just didn't have the chance to find out.

We can make spaghetti very quickly with using this sauce.  If we want a little extra we simply added fresh mushrooms, onion, etc.  She even found was to add it to make a chicken stew dish which is perfect taste.  Even my daughter loves it just how it is and she has egg, soy, and cow milk allergies as well so this is the perfect all purpose sauce.  Highly recommened food allergions to give it a try.

review/summary: Reunion Island is a fine coffee
review/text: Reunion Island SWP decaf is a nice, bold tasting decaf coffee. Drinking it you would be hard pressed to tell that it is a decaf and not a regular coffee. Just note that this is for pod coffee makers, like the Bunn MCP, Bunn My Cafe, Opod, Senseo and others. This is not for K-Cup or T-Disk makers like the Keurig or Tassimo. Some single-serve pod coffee makers may have a hard time with this coffee, as it is a 10 oz pod, whereas the standard seems to be 8 oz or less. This pod is problematic in Senseo makers, as they have a shallower pod holder. These will work fine in the Bunn or Opod makers.

review/summary: Wonderful Sugar Free Flavoring! Highly Recommended!
review/text: The Kahlua Flavor is one of my favorite DaVinci Sugar Free Flavored Syrup types. This was a great find for me since I am a Type 2 diabetic and really have an overpowering sweet tooth.<br /><br />We have tried quite a few of the different brands on the market, but have settled back to DaVinci since the flavors are good and they are sweetened with Splenda. Several of the other brands use Sorbitol (which my wife is slightly allergic to) or Maltitol (which causes me "gastric distress" in large quantities).<br /><br />The real test for anything sugar free is if my kids will use it, and they all like the flavor enough to go out of their way for it. We have used this in coffee and in baking with great results.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: My favorite coffee creamer years ago was a Kahlua flavored product, but it disappeared off the market refridgerator shelves, never to return!  So not only was I was thrilled to discover this Kahlua syrup, but it is sugar free as well.  That first cup of coffee in the morning has just gotten better at coaxing me out of bed.

review/summary: Just sweet, no flavor
review/text: Had purchased this years ago and didn't care for it, but thought now w/Splenda and the good reviews, it had to be good.  Wrong.  They get you to bite  w/the Kahlua on the label, but there is no comparison to Kahlua, doesn't taste at all like Kahlua.  Actually it doesn't really even taste like coffee.  It has just a sweet artificial flavor, but not a coffee flavor.  Very disappointing.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: Recently I used this syrup in homemade ice cream. I put 1/2 cup of the Sugar-Free Kahlua, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1/4 cup sugar-free sweetener (you can use Splenda, Stevia, whatever you like) into a bowl, stirred well, and then poured the ice cream batter into ice cube trays. I froze them for four hours, let thaw for about half an hour, and then blended them in my food processor (a blender works) for a short time. Amazing results! The ice cream has a great coffee flavor without any kind of aftertaste. You would have thought that I added real coffee. I am so pleased that I am making two more batches of this stuff. This sweetener also works well in coffee and protein shakes.

Not quite as good as the real thing, but close for the amount of calories saved. Downside is product is fairly expensive when having to add shipping. Not a bad price for the occasional drink, but would be too expensive if using regularly.

review/summary: Flavored Commercial Tea, Nothing Special
review/text: ***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***

review/summary: Misnomer, but great noodles all the same!
review/text: These are NOT soba noodles.<br /><br />But they are good!  As the earlier reviewer correctly indicated, they're the same type as ramen noodles.  Think of this as essentially a double-pack of plain ramen noodles, without the extra packaging and without the flavor packet.<br /><br />I use them for a quick sukiyaki-type of meal for 2-3 people (with apologies to true Japanese food-lovers, who won't be impressed by the shortcuts):<br /><br />1)  Cook a package of these noodles separately according to package instructions, drain, and keep warm (can be done almost at the end of the remaining steps, so that both noodles and meat/veggie topping are done at the same time).<br />2)  Brown 1/2 pound of hamburger, breaking it into smaller and smaller pieces as it cooks.<br />3)  About midway through the browning, add 1 very large chopped Spanish onion (or two smaller chopped onions) and 1-3 ribs of chopped celery to the pan, and keep stirring to soften those as well by the time the hamburger is fully browned.<br />4)  Remove the meat, onion and celery to a large bowl, keeping them warm, while draining all (or most of) the fat from the pan.  In the same pan, quickly saute a package of sliced mushrooms (small or large package, your choice), using fat from the beef if desired or just a little tap water to keep the mushrooms from burning if, like me, you want to eliminate the fat.<br />5)  Toward the end of the sauteeing of the mushrooms, add a bold amount of minced fresh garlic and minced fresh ginger (optional) to the pan, stirring frequently to keep them from burning as they soften with the mushrooms.<br />6)  Once mushrooms are just about cooked through, add one package of fresh mung bean sprouts, and stir for a minute or so until they're warmed.<br />7)  Add 2 small cans of beef broth or consomme or 1 larger can or carton to the pan; add ground garlic or ground ginger if desired in place of fresh if you had omitted either of them back in step 5, add soy sauce to taste, mix with the reserved beef, onion and celery while the broth warms, and serve over noodles.  Yum!  Great for leftovers, too.

review/summary: Simply Amazing
review/text: I was addicted to the Triscuit Rosemary and Olive Oil for a very long time. That is, up until I tried the Dill Sea Salt and Olive Oil Tricsuits.<br /><br />I will admit that I was uneasy when I first tried a Dill flavored product 10+ years ago. The first dill product I tried was produced by a Canadian company, recommended by a friend I met online living in Alberta, Canada. (I believe the name brand was Old Dutch Dill Pickle Chips.. though I'm not 100% certain) They were excellent, which led me to crave other dill flavored products.<br /><br />The next product was produced by Spitz, which were dill flavored sunflower seeds, marketed by a Dutch family who moved to Ontario, Canada. I'm not sure if anyone reading this has ever had a cheek full of sunflower seeds on one side of their mouth and shells in the other, but if you have, add a dill flavor to it. It however doesn't have a vinegar flavor to it like pickles. Overall this is a good product.<br /><br />Lay's, seeing an opportunity, took a chance in (I'm guessing the year) 2008. Once again, the American consumers loved this flavor alternative. In my honest opinion, I feel the Lay's dill flavor is too strong and tangy: there is too much vinegar flavor added to it. Keep this in mind when you are reading the rest of this review.<br /><br />Which brings me to the dill flavored Triscuits...<br /><br />It's a combination of that wonderful Triscuit crunch, texture and flavor we have all grown to love combined with a perfect dill flavor. It is very yummy.<br /><br />The caloric value yields 120 calories per serving and only 4 grams of fat.. but this is with a serving size of 6 crackers. You might be tempted to eat half of the box in one sitting as I almost have.. but be warned as a full box is 1080 calories and 36 grams of fat. yikes!<br /><br />Highly recommended

I only got this because I am a fan of the Ostrium jerkee sticks.

review/summary: Great cat food.  It's a keeper!
review/text: All 3 of my cats love this food.  They were previously on Wellness Turkey and when the cans were recalled I tried this on the suggestion of a family friend since their one cat has the same crystal issues our oldest does.  He eats his prescription dry in the morning and this at night.  Normally he's content to let the other two cats get to their food first and hold back with patience for his own, but with this it is the first time I have seen him muscle away the other two cats to eat.  I'll be sticking with this and the turkey flavor.<br /><br />Also there is no fish in this or the turkey flavor wet or dry foods which is excellent!  My cats don't tend to enjoy food that has fish in it and this is one of the few foods I can find that is both good for them and has no fish.  One of them does not like the peas in the food, he will eat around them, but one of the others eats them when he's done.  So if your cat hates bits of veggies they may not really enjoy it as much.<br /><br />Oh and one more point, it doesn't have that funky wet food smell a lot of other foods (even good ones) have.  I really can't smell it once I stand up after putting it in the bowl.

review/summary: Excellent choice for my finicky feline!
review/text: Since my elderly cat has started eating a wet food diet, she's become extremely finicky. She used to eat anything I'd put in front of her, until about a year ago when she decided nothing was good enough.  I'd been through every brand in the store...she doesn't like fish, plain chicken or lamb so my choices were limited.  When I found this, I gave it a try since she primarily likes beef. The ingredients were excellent and I read great reviews from Vets about it online.  She has been scarfing this food down from day 1 and still loves it. There are peas and carrots in it and the  consistency of it is very mushy. She likes it that way, so she doesn't have to chew much. I also noticed it doesn't dry out if there's any left in her bowl for several hours, like other brands have.  I definitely plan to continue giving this to her. I've been ordering on Amazon since it's been difficult to find it in my local pet stores lately.

review/text: Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal. Cats have hard time digesting plant matter. This is closer to dog food than cat food since dog's physiology will allow digestion of many plant based food itms. My cats ate about half of the yellow goo around the peas and carrots. If you want a true holistic approach for cats, veggies gotta go.

Granted sometimes he eats around the carrots, peas and green beans, but he does eat them.

review/summary: Dog Food Masquerading as Cat Food
review/text: My cat loved the dry version of spot's stew.  When she was sick with a UTI, I purchased this in hopes of adding some additional fluid to her diet.  When I dumped it in her bowel, she looked up at me as if I were mad, and I couldn't blame her.  It is literally "stew," with whole chunks of peas, carrots, etc. in it.  Cats are carnivores.  I have owned several, and I have never seen one of them willingly eat a piece of fruit or vegetable, grain products excluded, that hadn't been completely ground up and disguised in something else.<br /><br />She took one sniff and walked away.  Of course, cats are unpredictable creatures and YMMV.  But there are loads of good quality pate-style wet foods and all-meat wet foods that most cats are more likely to prefer.
