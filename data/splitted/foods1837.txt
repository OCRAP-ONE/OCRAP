review/summary: Favorite Breakfast Bar!
review/text: This is by far and away my favorite breakfast bar on the planet (thus far discovered).  The dark chocolate chips are essentially unsweetened and complement the perfectly tart and sweet cherries.  The Kashi cereal mix holds the whole thing together with honey or something.  Darn good stuff.  They are sometimes hard to find at the store and 12 boxes will last a long time (6 bars per box)!

review/summary: Delicious...and Nutritious
review/text: Best tasting granola bar I have ever had (and I've tried many....I'm kind of a health nut). They are a little expensive and hard to find but buying by the bundle may be a good idea. What I love about Kashi products is that they are all natural, tasty, and good for you (whole grains). I eat a bar whenever I want a little snack and one about 1/2 hour before my workout. It seems to provide the perfect amount of carbs to fuel my workout, plus satifies my sweet tooth without my feeling guilty (yummy chocolate chips). I'm currently in Iraq and I have my mom and sister send me about 4-5 boxes at time. I'm obsessed!!!

review/summary: Great texture, nice tart cherry accents, high fiber, low fat-- but chocolate taste is almost negligible
review/text: As a chocoholic, I thought this bar would be one of those one-two punches--healthful ingredients plus the treat of dark chocolate. The combination of cherries and chocolate--be it in a cherry cordial by Godiva or a Black Forest cake is one of those perfect flavor duos. Sadly, the chocolate aspect is minimal, so I take a star away for that. I expected a burst of the dual flavor--cherry + chocolate. I didn't get that from this.<br /><br />HOWEVER, this is a very nice bar. The texture combines the chewiness and crunch aspects that make a granola bar fun to eat. It's not loaded with fat or calories like some other breakfast/snack granola bars out there. It has only 2 grams of fat (I'd tolerate more for a richer chocolate burst of flavor), and 4 grams of healthful fiber. No trans fat. 5 grams of protein. This is a good bar to keep in your purse for when a snack attack hits and you wanna sidetrack indulging in something junk-foodish.<br /><br />Every other bite, you get a nice tart surge of flavor from the cherries. That was nice.<br /><br />Now, more chocolate, please, Kashi folks!<br /><br />Enjoy...

The price is okay here on Amazon, but if you look in Target or Walmart, you may be able to find them for as little as $2.25 a box.

review/text: This is a nice small bottle of minced garlic with a wonderful rich, full aroma.  The garlic itself is very mild though.  It has absolutely no BITE!  unlike some fresh garlic bulbs.  This is great for some recipes but others...like hummus... would benefit from a more aggressive tangy taste.  Being prepared and bottled, there are no bulbs to go bad with excessive time and no mess of peeling and mincing.  I really like these Goya minced garlic bottles and highly recommend them to anyone who enjoys a milder garlic flavor. I will be buying them again!

review/summary: Best Granola I've Ever Found
review/text: I'm not a fan of granola by any means: at least not until now. I have tried making my own on many occasions but the mess, expense, amount of ingredients to keep on hand and the less than satisfactory results have pretty much turned me off. I purchased this product in 3 flavors as a last ditch effort: Cherry Walnut, Almond and Maple Walnut. They arrived together in 2 days, well packaged, fresh and crunchy. Did I mention FLAVORFUL? I am a true convert. This is the best. While I like all 3, my favorite is the Maple Walnut, followed by the Almond and then Cherry Walnut (mostly because the huge dried cherries taste more like golden raisins than cherries, but still very good. I should also mention that while the dried cherries are about the size of the bowl of a teaspoon and look like they are soft and pliable, they are very hard and take a lot of careful chewing, after which they become sticky. I didn't find that texture pleasant). And when the ingredients listed walnuts or almonds, I figured it would be microscopic smooshed up pieces mixed in so small I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a sesame seed and a piece of walnut or almond. BUT, the almonds are large pieces or whole almonds while the walnuts - well, the walnuts are planet-sized: sometimes 1/2 of an entire walnut and there are tons of them in a single bag of this granola. The maple walnut is the only one I find a bit on the sticky side, but not like caramel popcorn sticky-just a bit tacky. I've already used this in yogurt, cottage cheese, oatmeal, as a snack in mid afternoon, in salads, pancakes and yesterday morning, I made Bisquick biscuits and added some of all 3 flavors as an experiment. The biscuits were marvelous. Now, if I could only remember WHAT I did so I can make them again with the same success! Try this. I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you are, you can send it to me!! :)

review/summary: Incredibly Good, If It's The Same.
review/text: In shopping at a nearby Costco yesterday, I came across some Kirkland Signature Artichoke Hearts marinated in oil. Man, are they ever good! Incredible! Well, I just had to review this item and tell people about it. So I tried to look it up on the Amazon computer. Well, it isn't there. I found all kinds of artichoke hearts, but no Kirkland Signature. However, in sorting through this assortment, I think I found the same thing by the same manufacturer. Okay, Kirkland Signature is a Costco store brand. They don't manufacture  their items. They contract out to have other companies put stuff up for them. Well, I'm certain these Cara Mia Marinated Artichoke Hearts are the exact same thing as the Kirkland. The  giveaway is  the bottle and the cap on the bottle. The cap has two thin green lines running around the base, in exactly the same way as the Kirkland. Strangely, the Cara Mia bottle is labeled as 62 ounces and it must be a mistake. The exact same Kirkland bottle is 33 ounces. So, I think I'm right on this matter and it's a exceptionally quality item. Like to take a gamble?<br /><br />Gary Peterson

The scent is very strong, but not to the point where it's offensive in its own right, but is strong enough to mask the unpleasant smells the bags contend with.  I didn't have the other reviewer's problem- the scent remained for as long as I had the bags, and even made my "regular" bags smell good to an extent.<br /><br />Even more importantly- this is the only brand of bags I use.  I've tried others, and I've had breakage or size problems.  These are perfect.  They've never broken, and they're the perfect length for easy, clean tying.  I love them.

review/text: I enjoy using these bags.  I have a dog training book (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446675385">Good Owners, Great Dogs</a>) with a picture of a dog pooping, and the caption says: "To those of you who do not have housebreaking problems with your pet, this picture may seem a bit crass. But for those of you who have struggled with this particular behavior, a dog doing his business outside is a thing of beauty and a joy forever." Well, I think of this whenever I unfurl one of these bags.  My rescue dog may have came with all sorts of training issues, but bless her, she is perfectly house trained.<br /><br />The bags are a decent size, wide enough to encompass the target. They are long enough to tie with enough clean part at the top, but would be even nicer if they were a bit longer. They are occasionally hard to open. Each roll is approx. 2.25 inches wide and 1.25 inches thick, including a plastic core which seems unnecessary to me.  I don't have a Bags on Board brand dispenser but they fit into a dispenser purchased at Pet Food Express. The bags are printed so you can see where to tear, which is nice. The "Ocean Mist" scent is not what I would call a "fresh, clean fragrance" - a bit cloying and sweet - but it does help mask that other fresh fresh fragrance. The bags are a pretty color but the contents do show through a bit.<br /><br />All in all, these bags are a worthy buy. I will no longer risk the horror of grocery store plastic bags that sometimes have holes in them.

review/text: I LOVE these bags. Price and quality DOES matter when it comes to some products! I actually use these for my kitty litter box, and had bought some really cheap ones at the grocery store. They were tiny and really thin. I ordered these and they were great. They were a lot longer and thicker, and the fact that they are scented is a plus :) They're a little pricey, but I think they're worth it. And I NEVER smell anything when I throw the bags in the garbage. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.

review/text: I've been overpaying for the last year at Walmart and Target for the Arm & Hammer scented baggies until I found these online.  When they arrived, the first thing I did was smell them.  It sounds crazy, but the scents are really nice for drowning out other smells!  These are a nice fresh scent and not overwhelming.  I primarily use these at our changing table in my daughter's nursery.  I also keep a roll in each diaper bag, in the glove box of both vehicles, and in my purse.  Nasty diapers are the first thing to find their way into one of these, but I've used them for garbage in the car too.  Will be a return customer for sure!  They're perfect!

review/summary: Fabulous
review/text: Small apt, one jumbo litter box and 2 healthy litter box donors keep me scooping a few times a day. We all prefer a clean box. One meows and comes to tell me if someone (usually his furry buddy) pooped so I can clean up for the next occupant.<br /><br />I purchased a litter locker, great product but unnecessary. The refills are $5 each and barely lasted a week, so I was spending about $15-20 a month to toss cat poop. No thanks. I read a note in one review on the litter locker about diaper genie fitting and a better buy and thought if they make a roll of bags that hides a dirty diaper stink, that's exactly what we need. I bought a small plastic holder for diaper bags, it hangs in the bathroom and I use these very nicely scented bags that fit into the diaper bag dispenser. 100x times cheaper and since I toss garbage every 2 days, this is most economical, the bags are biodegradable and do just as advertised, contain odors and dont leak etc.

review/summary: Thumbs up from a dog walker!
review/text: I work as a dog walker for a petsitting company.  One of my clients keeps her leashes in the downstairs closet-- it has the most amazing smell and I could not figure out what it was!  I assumed it was some sort of air freshener.  One day, I saw one of these bags peeking out and took a whiff: ta da!<br /><br />I am hooked.  Not only do these bags smell fantastic, they are strong and portable.  I use them for work and am buying them for cleaning out my cats' litter as well.  The scent is strong enough that if I keep them near the litterboxes, I'm betting it can even tackle those odors or at least mask them until I can clean.  It's a sweet, uplifting but not cloying scent (I cannot believe I'm talking about poo bags this way) that could easily come from a high-quality air freshener.  Maybe I'll hide some of these throughout the house...

review/text: We first used the unscented version of these bags and were happy with them....until we discovered the scented bags. The scent does a great job of masking the sometimes unpleasant smell of what you are picking up. I've never had a bag break on me, and they are plenty large to use for a 90+  pound dog. Even our dog walker is impressed with these and wanted to know where we found them.<br /><br />I used to buy them locally but the pet stores were always sold out of the scented bags. Getting them on Amazon saves me from visiting 2 or 3 stores just trying to pick up a pack - and the price on Amazon is better.

review/summary: The SoyaJoy Automatic Soymilk Maker: Easy and Economical
review/text: I've been using the SoyaJoy Automatic Soymilk Maker about once a week for almost a year now.  A deal at $99, the soymilk maker has paid for itself over and over again.  It's so easy to use; my favorite recipe is my own: Pineapple Soymilk.  All you have to do is soak soy beans overnight.  Thaw half a can of frozen pineapple juice; add the juice to the SoyaJoy along with filtered or bottled water.  Add a tablespoon of oat flakes to the soy bean filter, then add the soy beans; attach the filter to the unit, plug it in, and about fifteen minutes later, your soymilk will be done.  Let it sit for about half an hour to cool; chill overnight in the refrigerator, and enjoy.  Using a whole can of frozen<br />pineapple juice overwhelms the taste of the soy beans and additional sweeteners are not needed.<br /><br />I also prepare soy milk this way: soak overnight soy beans, a few raw almonds and raw Virginia peanuts along with about half a teaspoon of Basmati rice; next day, prepare Soymilk as usual.  I add the Okara (the residue that is left after the liquid is drained off when making soybean milk) to homemade soups as well as when I cook rice (I use a crock pot in both cases); the Okara adds something special to each meal.<br /><br />"The SoyaJoy Concentrated Magic Cleaning Powder" is very easy to use, and aids in keeping the soy bean filter clean; in fact, I used the powder, as directed, only a few times, then one day I realized that I didn't need to use the powder anymore, and a simple cleaning was possible using water, the brush that comes with the SoyaJoy, and a sponge.<br /><br />If you plan on using the SoyaJoy often, you can pre-soak the soy beans; they keep up to a week in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator.<br /><br />I've been on the "Blood Type" diet for a decade; Dr. Peter J. D'Adamo says of his diet that soy-based foods are "super foods" for a Blood Type A.  Every time I walk by the soymilk section at the grocery store, I see an expensive way to buy that food; the SoyaJoy Automatic Soymilk Maker is the most economical and easiest way for a Blood Type A to enjoy "super food"!

review/summary: great machine but takes time
review/text: We've used the SoyaJoy machine for well over a year.  It makes great milk and you can experiment with flavors till you get your favorite.  We use a few less soy beans and add some soaked almonds for a great combination milk. As far as the end product, it gets 5 stars.  Minus one full star for time involved to wind up with only about 6 cups of milk.<br /><br />The one thing their web site videos do not ever tell you is the amount of clean up time it takes each time you make a batch.  When you do a double batch as we often do, plan on close to an hour and a half total time with 2 cooking times, straining the milk through a fine strainer and then squeezing the mash through several layers of cheesecloth and cleaning the machine itself twice so there is absolutely no soy residue left.<br /><br />We use the left over mash (okara) for everything from super breakfast porridge base to fake crab cakes to cookies.  End result: The money saved altogether more than makes up for the time involved.<br /><br />We are also on the Eat Right 4 Your Blood Type food plan and soy is very beneficial for blood Type A's.  Type B -- don't use soy, period.

review/summary: Wonderful machine!  No more throwing away packaging!
review/text: I love my soyajoy.  I bought it 5 years ago and it still works as well as ever.  It's so much faster and easier (and easier to clean) than making soymilk the old fashioned way, in a pot with blender.  Also, I don't have to buy soymilk, which is often expensive (for organic), overpackaged, and since I live out in the country, difficult to find.<br /><br />I usually make a soy/rice blend.  This is one of the reasons I like making my own, because I don't want too much soy and mixing the beans and rice like this creates a complete protein.  It also tastes less "beany".  I used to add some almonds too, before I got too cheap to buy them.<br /><br />The machine should be washed as soon as the milk is done, but it's not hard to do.  I still haven't used the cleaning powder that came with it.  I just give it a good scrub.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this soymilk maker is that I'm not throwing away piles of packaging that I can't even recycle here.

The other flavors taste a million times better than this! I don't have the slightest clue how this got past any human taste testers.

The fact that it is duck means you're not spending as much and the flavor is right on.<br /><br />If you don't like meat, don't eat things that have to be killed to be eaten. If you do like meat and you love foie gras, then this product is a must-have.

review/summary: Interesting "Natural Source of Antioxidants" made from green tea, acai berries, and grapeseed extract
review/text: I like a variety of teas, especially green and white, so I was intrigued with the ingredients in this one. It does have more taste than I usually find in green or white tea. It isn't too sweet, which is good, because I don't like sweet tea. It smells and tastes a lot like blackberries to me.<br /><br />I won't try to judge about the health benefits or claims for vitality, increased metabolism, ability to promote health and anti-ageing, etc. I just enjoy different teas and was looking for another way to drink green tea for its benefits.<br /><br />It's labeled as a "dietary tea supplement" "Made with Organic Tea". Since the ingredients were important to me, I'll list them here for those of you who are interested:<br /><br />Organic Green Tea 900 mg<br />Organic Green Tea Extract 100 mg<br />Organic Hibiscus 400 mg<br />Proprietary Blend (whatever that means) 600 mc<br />The rest of the ingredients don't include amounts per serving:<br />Ginseng (panax)<br />Acai Berry Extract<br />Blackberry Pieces<br />Bilberry Juice Powder<br />Black Current<br />Grapeseed Extract<br />Stevia<br /><br />Other Ingredients: Natural Grape and Berry Flavors<br /><br />It does contain caffeine. "We have added 100 mg of pure organic tea extract high in polyphenols (antioxidants) for maximum health benefits."<br /><br />Directions: For health benefits drink 2-4 cups of tea throughout the day.

review/summary: Ramune is awesome fun!
review/text: Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The melon flavor reviewed here has a very unique taste. Think honeydew more than watermelon, sweet and light with that distinctive Ramune lemon-lime backbone flavor holding everything together. Truly a treat.<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended. Pricing at an Asian market should run in the $7.99 to $8.99 range for a six-pack.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.

review/text: These candies are truly from ARCOR (the "good" ones you find in a mixed bag of hard candies), not the imitator. ARCOR wrappers have "ARCOR" written in silver on the green "leaves" on the wrapper, the red coloring on the wrapper is "orangier" than the imitation, and the "seeds" on the wrapper are more numerous and closely spaced. They have a better taste somehow. I am glad I persisted in my ordering to find the right item. The Amazon page titled "ARCOR Strawberry buds" is misleading and I received the imitation from Columbia SA, not Argentina, as the true ARCOR originates from. Those were returned. What can I say, I'm picky!

Many hot sauces have extreme heat - and there are some hotter than Dave's Ultimate Insanity now - but very few sauces combine the extreme heat with a very interesting flavor. Dave does exactly that with this sauce. If you can't take the heat, stick with your old Tabasco sauce, but if you want a new, exciting flavor with enough heat to knock your hat in the creek, try Dave's Ultimate Insanity. I know it will peel the wax off a hardwood floor, it says so right on the bottle! This sauce has a taste you can't refuse.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food at first, and slowly began to not like it. After reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot fully digest corn as they are carnivores. Corn it is just a cheap filler that can cause dogs to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality pet foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value.The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging if the product does not contain the pictured items; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store.

Cooked 3 steaks thus far using 3 different methods found on the internet (no cooking suggestions included in shipment or on vendor's website).  All 3 attempts resulted in tough meat.(Seared 2 minutes per side and then cooked another 3 minutes turning often).  I've had more tender Choice ribeyes from Fry's in AZ at $4.88 a pound. Very disappointed. These steaks were graded 7-9 BMS (so I was told in response to my email inquiry). I find that hard to believe.

review/text: AlwaysDirect did an excellent job packaging and delivering.  They actually packed it with 2 freezer bags to try and keep it cool.  Now the freezer bags were complete thawed by the time i recieved it but I appreciate the gesture.  The chocolate was fine and not melted.  My only complaint is it is too expensive.  Target sells a 9.5oz bag for $2.99. This "tub" is 40oz(note: product description is wrong.  It is not 12/4.6oz packages; it is one 40oz tub).  So it should be no more then $12.59 and with the shipping it is 67% more expensive then just buying at Target.  Don't be fooled by the count because this is the foil wrapped andes and are 1/2 the size of the ones in the Target pack.<br /><br />So good product and delivery if you have no other option but way over priced.

review/summary: Deluxe Bar is Delightful
review/text: Mmmmmm.  Recently tried the deluxe bar after trying all the other flavors and so far it is my favorite.  Thus far, the deluxe bars have been delicate and crumbly like halvah "ought to be".  Though I've only had a few bars, there is a possibility that I may come across one with that unpleasant cardboard texture (I've had this experience with the chocolate flavored bar).  I did squeeze several of the unopened deluxe bars and they felt soft and crumbly (Mmmmm).  I have high hopes for this bar and have a feeling that I may have hit the jackpot on this flavor.  Wish me luck!<br /><br />It would be nice if all the ingredients were listed here on amazon.  Although, had I known what the other ingredients are, I might not have ordered this flavor.  Besides sesame seeds, sweetener etc., there are raisins, pumpkin seeds, almonds, sunflower seeds, cashews and pistachios, but I have, to date, only noticed almonds. Most of the other ingredients may be very well ground into the mixture or maybe I have not eaten a bar with noticeable pieces of the other ingredients.<br /><br />After placing my order, I read the ingredients on the Camel's web site and my mind thought "Oh no, big chunks of raisins, nuts and seeds will ruin my halvah eating rapture."  Not So.  I'm delighted!

It doesn't have cane sugar, it has protein, and it's delicious. Sometimes you get one that seems a little taffy-like and tough. I'm assuming that maybe it's been around longer. But at their best, they are creamy, moist, sort of sandy textured, and very flavorful. Just sweet enough. I can be satisfied with a couple of bites if I just want something after a meal.

review/summary: wonderful treat
review/text: Hard to find in stores.  Just sweet and sour enough.  Wish there were more flavors and easier to find.  Like the smaller packs so husband and I just split one when we need something sweet after dinner.  Low in calories so not a bad treat.

review/summary: Absolutely horrible. Tastes like cleaning solution.
review/text: I'm a big fan of regular Twizzlers. If you think that these Sweet & Sour Filled Twists are anything like regular Twizzlers then you will be sorely disappointed. These taste absolutely horrible. They taste like sucking on a bottle of cleaning supplies, or maybe like cheap side-of-the-road reststop hand soap. Further, the texture is like soft plastic filled with elmer's glue. Nevermind the bad taste, the texture is so gross you won't want to eat these. These are also very, very unhealthy with a whopping 70 calories PER TWIST. Avoid this candy at all cost--it is repulsive.

review/text: My dog loves these treats.  Our vet recommended them for improved dental health, but no one carries the small size locally.  My dog is only 9 pounds, so these are great!

review/text: We buy the teenies for our dog.  She only weighs 8 pounds and absolutely adores these edible bones.  These bones are her absolute favorite treats.
