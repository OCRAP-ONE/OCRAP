review/summary: Excellent quality and value
review/text: I have purchased the Zoe evoo in cans (regular and organic) many times in the past and been very satisfied.  I like this Zoe 100% arbequina evoo even better, as far as taste goes.  It is very flavorful, somewhat grassy with no bitter taste, and has a smooth, silky texture.  It is more of a rich yellow color than green.  It is a great all purpose oil that holds up to sauteeing, drizzling over cooked pasta, for use in salad dressings and for bread dipping.  It is also pretty economical to use for all kitchen uses, especially when purchased on subscription basis. This comes in a clear bottle, not my preference for storage of olive oils, so I have wrapped the bottles with foil to minimize light exposure and slow degradation.  Oils can also be stored in the refrigerator or freezer to maintain quality.

review/summary: olive perfume
review/text: lovely aroma and fruity flavor with the tiniest hint of a peppery finish is making me think that the best olives are grown in spain rather than italy.<br /><br />ever since the scandal broke in the New Yorker magazine (august 13, 2007 - Slippery Business by Tom Mueller.  google it.) about the fraudulent practices of italian olive oil merchants i have been looking for ways to identify good sources of untainted olive oil.  recent reviews in Cooks Illustrated confirm that the truest and most consistent flavors found in the EVOO market today are coming from spain.  at a price.<br /><br />this Zoe Arbequina varietal brings both flavor and value back to us, the amazon consumers.  priced to compete with the italian junk in the grocery store, this line of oils meets my unfairly high standards.  (i hate to be a snob, but a bad oil can ruin a meal.)<br /><br />yes, this is a plastic bottle.  so what.<br /><br />thanks to Tom Mueller, the New Yorker, Cooks Illustrated, Amazon, and Zoe.  great oil.  tonight it gets drizzled on baby creamer potatoes, with sel gris and fresh dill.  bon appetit.<br /><br />five stars

review/summary: An excellent olive oil at a reasonable price
review/text: I am particularly fond of arbequina olive oil and have had this brand of olive oil on subscription for several years. This oil has the buttery, fruity flavor typical of arbequina olive oil. It does not have a big robust flavor typical of some other olive oils. Rather, it has a more subtle olive flavor that I prefer.<br /><br />I use this oil for most of my food preparation except for high temperature frying. I've even used it to make an olive oil cake that turned out beautifully. All in all, I have been very pleased with this brand of arbequina olive oil. I do recommend it.

review/summary: Great oil but PACKING/SHIPPING WAS NOT GOOD on 12 bottle buy
review/text: We are big fans of Olive Oil from Spain, and we like Zoe products so much that we ordered a dozen bottles of Zoe 100% EV Arbequina, but i will change my subscription after this experience.  The twelve plastic liter bottles were shipped loose in one of Amazon's light-duty boxes with two of those small plastic air-bags.  The box was not meant to have so much weight rattling around loose and the UPS guy asked me to open it to make sure that there was no problem with the merchandise.  the bottles were beat up and squashed, but thankfully none had been crushed open.  I know that the manufacturer does not send them to Amazon warehouse like that.  Don't the warehouse packers go to handling class ? ? ? ?  :-(

review/summary: Great Deal, Great Taste
review/text: I purchased this olive oil because it was one of Amazon's subscribe and save items and I figured why not I needed some olive oil for my cooking needs.  I was quite pleased with what I received mainly because I wasn't sure what to expect.  I still had a little bit of the olive oil from my old bottle left so I was able to taste the two and the Zoe Diva one was far superior in my opinion.  To think I paid about 9 dollars for a smaller sized bottle of the other stuff made me laugh as Amazon did it again helping me save some more money on an item I need quite often.<br /><br />The packaging it arrived in was pretty good and the outside plastic that held the two bottles together looked to have a lot of traces of oil on it and it did, but neither of my bottles were leaking at all.  I guess maybe it was just residual oil from when it was being packaged or maybe another set leaked.<br /><br />Still its in my S&S to be shipped every 6 months and looks like it will stay that way.

As a Subscription especially, it's an awesome deal, cheaper than olive oils in my local supermarket, and in a plastic rather than heavy glass container. The plastic's very fine, doesn't hold the scent, recycles, ultra-light.

review/summary: Great chew toy for dogs
review/text: We have two young Labrador Retriever dogs who love to chew. I first purchased a couple of smaller 4-inch bones from an all natural pet store, spending any where between $5 to $7 per bone. When I came on Amazon, I found this box of 12 from "Entirely Pets" and instantly purchased them.  Not only were they bigger (7-inches) than the 4-inch bones, but now I could purchase a box of 12 for much less than what I would have normally spent in a retail store.  These are great bones for dogs who chew.  However, you may need to supervise your dog(s) depending on how well they are able to chew the actual bone.  Both of my dogs will spend countless hours chewing on these bones.  They are great if you need to get things done in the house and want to keep the dogs occupied.  The discretion I suggest with supervision is because my dogs have been able to crack the bones.  Their intent on doing so is to get the inside marro out and by crushing the bones, they succeed in this task.  If this can occur with big dogs, it may occur for little dogs.  It all depends on how strong of a jaw your dog(s) has.  The other suggestion is, and since our dogs break the bones, is to take the bones away, especially if you'll leave the house.  If they break the bones, they may choke on the pieces.  We also use these bones as a deterrent outside so the dogs don't go after any tree branches that may fall in the yard.  These two play well together and having a bone like this to play with is a great new toy for them.  I highly recommend these bones and know your dog(s) will enjoy them as well.  Buy in bulk and give a bone a week to your dog.  They'll love you for it and also enjoy chewing them.

review/summary: Greasy, but long lasting indeed.
review/text: The only con I have with this bone is that it's greasy and smells bad (very salty smelling).<br />The greasiness did go away once my dog gnawed off the jerky bits.<br /><br />Pro: Another review said 1 bone a week, but it's been two weeks and my dog hasn't even cracked the bone. she continues to chew on it on a daily basis. And she's an active chewer.<br /><br />I bought these bones as a replacement for Rawhide (my dog was chewing them up very fast, and my bf's dog loved them too, and chewed them up quickly). I was trying to find something tasty that lasted longer than rawhides.<br /><br />With the reviews I read, I decided to purchase a box of Merricks.<br />My dog = collie/hound mix<br />His dog = american bulldog<br /><br />The first day my dog went NUTS over it. She chewed for hours very satisfied. It was perfect because she'd always whine to play when I had to do school work online. This settled that problem. The only problem I had was the greasiness of the bone. So I made her eat it on a towel for the first day.<br /><br />Second day: Bad habit of bothering me when I was doing school work continued, and she was uninterested in her bone, even after pointing the bone out to her. So I got kind of worried, "what am i gonna do with the other 11!?"<br /><br />Now: Every day since, she pulls this bone out of her "toy box" and chews on it. When I get home from class, this is the only bone ever pulled out. She doesn't even play with her other bones/toys anymore. She's whines less when I am busy.<br /><br />Overall thought: Satisfied BUT 12 is way too many. This would last me over a year at the rate we are going.

review/summary: Certainly worth the purchase!
review/text: I first purchased two single bones from a natural dog pet store and paid about $5 to $6 per bone.  The bone at that cost was only about 4-inches long.  Two at those prices was expensive in my opinion.  Since I shop a lot on Amazon because the prices are much cheaper, I found this vendor and bundle of bones to be considerably cheaper than you would find in a pet store.  If you buy in bulk online from a good vendor, chances are you will return to that vendor again and again, which is what I do.<br /><br />I first purchased from the vendor on Amazon a bundle of 12 of these larger bones.  These are great for my two Labrador Retrievers.  If you own this type of dog, you will know that your dog likes to chew.  Mine do, particularly my younger lab.  Every Saturday, we treat the two to a bone per dog.  Both my dogs will spend hours chewing away at these bones.  My oldest lab will eventually give up, primarily because I think she gets bored of chewing and usually takes a nap afterwards.  But my younger lab will chew and chew and chew.. for hours on end.  It's funny to see him with the bone in his mouth later.  He always has to have something in his mouth, so these are great options for him.<br /><br />We used to purchase nylabones and other chew toys. Now, we purchase these bones in bulk, saving tons of money on the product and tons on money on not spending for other chew toys that the dogs tend to chew to pieces.  Because these are real bones with marrow inside, they have a special meaty taste on the exterior that I think attracts the dogs to spending the hours just chewing away.  I also believe that one of the reasons they'll continue to chew at these is because of the "surprise" hidden inside the bone.<br /><br />These bones are perfectly safe and a great treat for any large breed dog to chew on.  Because they are larger than normal, I would not recommend this size on smaller dogs, like toy dogs.  There are smaller bones available by the same vendor for smaller dogs you can purchase.  Certainly, any dog that likes to chew will love this bone.  I highly recommend these bones to any dog owner.

review/summary: Merrick bone
review/text: I ordered a box of these a while back from Amazon and my Labrador absolutely loved them and since i was starting to run low i decided to come back and reorder some. I tend to favor ordering from vendors that offer Prime shipping since i have the membership but this time i decided to order from PetCo.<br /><br />I compared the prices from other vendors even though Amazon had lowered their price on this to 36$ compared to 59$ when i first bought them and i was shocked to see PetCo offering these for 6.99$ with 6$ shipping!<br /><br />So i figured that's a steal for these bones and even though my logic kept saying there must be something wrong with the advertisement i did not want to believe it so silly me went ahead and ordered a bunch only to get upset when i received them and realized a "SUPER bargain" was only an illusion.<br /><br />I contacted PetCo and they were very polite and helped out right away with the situation so overall even though it was upsetting i didn't find the jackpot of dog bones at least everyone was nice enough to help out and solve this confusion.<br /><br />Either than that i absolutely LOVE the way Merrick bones make my baby girl so happy and excited every time its time for a new so i will definitely not stop buying them just because of this hick-up.

So you might want to keep and eye on bigger dogs. Otherwise, its much cheaper on line than in the pet store and well worth it if you pamper your dogs.

review/text: Our grocery store stopped carrying these, instead opting for a "local" brand that is twice as dense, and twice the calories.  These Koyo rice cakes aren't as fresh as the ones I used to be able to buy in our store, but I spread them out on a flat pan and leave in the oven on "Warm" for about 5 or 6 minutes.  Then I let them cool completely, and put them back in the bag, and store the bag in the freezer.  This way, they taste very fresh.  I just leave the big shipping box up on a storage shelf, and take out the individual bags one by one to crisp them as I need them.

review/text: I caught this during one of the really low-priced deals. I am honestly not a big cereal person, but this stuff is so good that it's my go-to when I'm feeling a sweets craving coming on. Instead of having a bowl of ice cream for desert, I'll have some honey bunches of oats. It can't be THAT much better for me but I figure the oats instead of sugar have to do some good!<br /><br />The price was great, and the cereal was great. It wasn't out of date like S&S items can sometimes be, and the expire date was reasonable enough to let me eat it all up in time. I'd definitely recommend and will buy again when the price is right; not much else to say about it :).

review/summary: Does not taste as fresh as the cereal I've always had at the grocery store
review/text: Pros:<br /><br />Received prompt delivery<br />Well packaged for this bulk item<br />Pricing was dirt cheap<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Opened the first box and it is nowhere near the same great tasting cereal I've eaten for years.<br /><br />My opinion on the cereal in general*<br /><br />If you like crunchy, sweet but not too sweet cereal this is for you. I used to eat it because I thought it was healthy yet tasty. Probably not so much, but I still love it. What is it with Americans and our attachment to favorite cereals?<br /><br />PS- I will update review after tasting another box. If it's the same will contact Amazon.<br /><br />**UPDATE<br /><br />These boxes expire on 10/13/2011 (Don't know the average for cereal, but roughly 11 months after purchase)<br /><br />The taste has improved, don't know if it's because I got used to it or what. I will up the rating by one because it does not taste great.

review/summary: A nice mix of tastes and textures
review/text: I really enjoy the mixture of tastes and textures in this cereal. It's far less boring than corn flakes, and more enjoyable (and far fewer calories) than conventional granola cereals. Not the healthiest choice that one could make for a breakfast cereal, but it nowhere near as bad as others. Most important, it tastes great!<br /><br />Watch the prices since if you catch it on a price dip, the Amazon price is better than what you'd get at a warehouse store (and much better than a regular grocery store unless it's on sale and you have coupons). The prices bounce around a lot, so if there's a good price dip, stock up.

review/summary: Normally love this item, but do NOT order it from Amazon!
review/text: This is the cereal that I typically eat and I love it, but when you order these multi-packs from Amazon, they send boxes that have expired promotions (sometimes not even in English, so I don't know what market they were intended for) and while they're within the timeframe of the "Best By" date, they're painfull stale tasting.  Don't save the extra buck or two and have to endure that over the course of 5 boxes of cereal.

review/text: Received a 5pack of 18ox Family size box.  The quality was stale and the cereals were not crispy as usual despite the NOV 11 2011 expiration date.  I am very disappointed as my expectation was that the quality would be up to par with the one sold at the grocery store.  I strongly recommend buying this at the local grocery store instead of on AMZN despite a good price.

review/text: Because it can be difficult to find the puttanesca style spaghetti sauce in supermarkets, I have taken to buying it from Amazon. I first discovered this style in a Capri-style Italian restaurant, NOT my Mom's kitchen, and have preferred it ever since. This brand tastes like I remember in good restaurants, when they offer it, so I can recommend it without reservation (and you don't need reservations, for that matter). If it seems a little too bland, add some red pepper flakes. Enjoy.

review/text: We found this to be a good and healthy alternative to the crackers we were buying. No trans-fats / hydrogenated oils, no enriched flours. Just simple ingredients such as rye flour! What do you you with them? Top with cream cheese, fruit, applesauce, tomato and cheese, or visit the producer's website. They have recipes and suggestions if you're starved for ideas.<br /><br />I prefer the light rye over some of their other varieties - the taste is fairly plain, and not as hard and crunchy (I have sensitive teeth).

review/text: Initially, I was not impressed based on an experiment I threw together with the ham and spreadable brie cheese I had handy. I just wanted to hurry up and be done with the disgusting result. I'm not too big on ham to begin with, but it seemed to be a good idea at the time...perhaps the combination was to blame, but for whatever the reason, I do not recommend it.<br /><br />I figured it might not be the Wasa crispbread's fault, so later I browsed the recipes online and stumbled across one that takes advantage of brie using fruit preserves. It was absolutely delicious.<br /><br />Though not bad, they are not delicious or satisfying on their own, but if you find a good combination of toppings, you can end up with a delicious treat that's perfect for snacking. The result really depends on what you put on them, as texture is the most prevalent contribution the Wasa crispbreads provide; their flavor is very subtle, and the crackers are very light, and crisp.

review/summary: Tasty soup that provides lots of fiber
review/text: This soup comes in 19-ounce cans, which gives you slightly more than 2 servings.  A serving is identified as one cup.  I'm not sure why they don't give you 16-ounce cans to make it exactly 2 servings.  Anyway, the soup is delicious, with lots of tomato flavor enhanced with the very herbal taste of basil.  You can see the basil in the soup.  I like it enough so that I actually consume all 19 ounces for lunch.  As one serving gives you 28% of the daily recommended allowance of dietary fiber, consuming all 19 ounces means that I'm getting almost two-thirds of my dietary fiber in one lunch.  If you do not consume enough dietary fiber, this soup is a definitely delicious supplement that will help.

The nuts arrived very quickly and were fresh and ample in portion.  I'm very satisfied with this product!

review/summary: Sweet, tasty, and healthy
review/text: I am thrilled to have found this product a few years ago.  It's tasty, it's instantaneous to make, and it's made of gf oats, buckwheat, sorghum, brown rice, amaranth, quinoa, and millet - much healthier than many other gluten-free hot or cold cereal options!  I keep these in my bag in case I can't find gluten-free food, since I can usually convince someone to give me a cup of hot water.  Good for taking on the plane with you for the same reason.  Thank you, Amazon, for starting to carry this! I have made special trips out of my way to grocery stores which happen to stock this item so I can stock pile them. I will say that this cereal is fairly sweet, however, so if you don't have much of a sweet tooth, go with the original flavor and add honey to taste.  Thanks for a great product, Eco-planet!

review/text: I can't eat gluten so I was happy to find a gluten-free multi-grain cereal. It's a nice alternative to gluten-free oats or rice cereal. The different cereals add great nutritional value, nice texture, and some interesting flavor. But overall the flavors are a bit on the bland side, and don't taste as rich as oatmeal. It's not bad though. To make it more satisfying I usually add something: cinnamon, dried fruit, chocolate chips, or a splash of coconut milk. Also, it's nice that it's instant. A lot of gluten-free hot cereals are not instant, and I don't have time to make them in the morning.

review/summary: Soup is great, cans may come dented
review/text: Clearly I must love this soup as I got myself 12-packs of these things.  Twice.  And I live alone.  Or maybe that's why I bought so much soup?<br /><br />At least compared to local stores like Safeway, you can't beat the Amazon price for these soups.  Cheapest I saw the soup was $3.29 a can at my local Safeway, compared to $2.78 a can at time of writing this review (before the subscribe and save discount.)<br /><br />Flavour wise, the wild-rice adds a nice texture.  I much prefer it over potatoes.  The chicken is pretty decent too -- for processed meat in a can.<br /><br />The one problem you MIGHT encounter though is that about 30% of my soup cans came dented.  Amazon needs to figure out how to better package soup for transit.<br /><br />But then again, that's where the great customer service at Amazon comes in.  When I got a hold of support, they offered to refund my case or just send me a replacement case.  I opted for a replacement and just discarded the dented cans.<br /><br />So you can pretty much order this with confidence if you like this flavour in the first place, and if there's a problem, Amazon will fix it. :)

review/summary: Great product - poor packaging
review/text: I ordered the pack of 12 for my mother, as this has been one of her favorite soups, but was no longer available in the local grocery stores.  The problem was in the packaging.  When she received it, one corner can was mashed in - the soup had spilled all over the rest of the cans inside the package.  Upon unpacking the cans and cleaning them up, she discovered two more cans that were leaking around the lid. Over the next couple of weeks she opened two more cans which were good.  Then opened one that was completely spoiled, most likely from a tiny leak that was not noticed.  There are still 6 more cans that are unopened.  They appear to be ok.<br />When my mother received the order, she tried to do a review on the packaging but wasn't allowed because it hadn't  been ordered as a "gift" to her.  She procrastinated in complaining to me, and when she did, I was handling family emergencies and did not go online to review the packaging.<br />Final summary - the soup is delicious, the packaging is terrible!

Imagine a really sickly sweet apricot candy cane and then put that in your tea.  Absolutely undrinkable.<br /><br />I previously bought their Jasmine Green Tea.  It is really good.  Has real tea leaves and jasmine flowers.  But definitely pass up this "tea"

review/summary: I like them, but 20% end up in crumbs...
review/text: I am currently keeping my dog away from fowl and beef to see if I can clear up his tear stains a little, so I stopped feeding him his usual treats, after sorting through over a dozen non-fowl, non-beef and healthier type treats I found most had flour as the first and even 2nd ingredient. I don't totally object to flour, but his other treats have always been higher quality than that, so I'd prefer treats similar to those. So finally I came across Evo's Cravings, viola, first ingredient herring, and 2nd ingredient herring meal, and the rest of the ingredients are fabulous as well! And at a great price point, $6.89 in a store local to me. I know i love herring so I was hoping my dog would love it too, and indeed he does. The only problem is the last 20% of the treats ended up as pure dust, so consider these about 20% more expensive than the price, or the bag containing 20% less product. I did not like that, and unless I find them on sale to compensate for that 20%, i won't purchase them again.<br /><br />Awesome ingredients though:<br />Herring, Herring Meal, Peas, Pea Fiber, Pumpkin, Tomatoes, Sunflower Oil (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols, a Natural Source of Vitamin E), Herring Oil, Apples, Carrots, Potassium Chloride, Cottage Cheese, Dried Chicory Root, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Chondroitin Sulfate, mineral (Zinc Proteinate, Iron Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Calcium lodate), Vitamins (Ascorbic Acid, Vitamin E Supplement, Betaine Hydrochloride, Vitamin A Supplement, Niacin Supplement, Calcium Pantothenate, Beta Carotene, Vitamin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Biotin, Folic Acid, Phylloquinone)

review/summary: The Princess of Hot Stuff
review/text: &quot;Hime&quot; is &quot;Princess Brand&quot; and it is a big seller in Japanese and Korean grocery stores. This faintly green powder is mixed with water to make a thick paste to get wasabi, used for sushi, sashimi and to flavor tuna and other dishes. <p>One trick is to mix the wasabi in a rice bowl or tea bowl and turn the bowl upside-down. Yes, that's what I said, turn it over. The paste will stick in the bowl, and the developing sulfurous gases that make wasabi hot, hot, hot are retained, improving the bite. Get that wasabi buzz. <p>I like to use it in tuna with wasabi-potato crust. Or being short on time, I just grill some yellowtail and mix a wasabi-sugar-soy sauce glaze and brush it on at the end of the grilling. Hot and sweet. Another totally bizarre but quite normal Japanese dish is wasabi nori chazuke, or tea-rice. Get some leftover rice warmed up in a bowl, put a dab of wasabi and a sprinkle of sushi nori strips. Pour hot green tea (bancha) over and drink like a soup. Said to be a cure for hangover (I wouldn't know, but they say it works.)

review/summary: Great grocery item for creative cooking!
review/text: I purchased this wasabi powder at our local Shaw's (same as Albertson's) for $2.99.  It is a very practical way to buy wasabi because you can make your own wasabi for sushi simply by adding water and stirring it together in a small bowl or you can add this to mayonnaise, mustard, oil and vinegar or do whatever you please with it.  This powdered wasabi has fresh flavor and it's an easy way to keep wasabi on hand for getting creative.  How about adding a small amount to a rub for seafood or steak?<br />Have fun with this practical grocery item that only takes up a small amount of space in your cupboard!  Or pack it in your bag when you head off for the weekend!

review/summary: This stuff will spice up your love life.
review/text: Well, maybe it won't actually spice up your love life, but then what can you say about powdered Wasabi.  Besides, it got you reading this  review.<br />  We mix thoroughly two tablespoons of the powder with about a half cup of fat-free mayonnaise.  Use it as a table condiment.  Good stuff!

review/summary: Contains Dye in it - So unnecessary
review/text: I cannot understand for the life of me why dye is added to color foods. I was excited to receive this to find out it has dyes and preservatives in it (which is not a good combo). I like to eat foods without these so I will be giving this away to the local food pantry.

review/summary: Ordering in bulk is not the best way to try this product.
review/text: I love the product and bought the 24 count box at the grocery store, but the area stores stopped carrying the hazelnut so I thought this would be the way to go.  Unfortunately 20% of the creamers cracked and leaked into and through the box.  I spent an hour cleaning up the others.  And some of them curdle when I add them to my coffee.  I won't be purchasing this product this way again.

review/summary: Non Delight creamer
review/text: I found this product priced right, but when it arrived I was not really impressed. At some point in time several of the containers had leaked and dried in the box. I had to soak them in water to get them apart and to clean up the mess. I would never order this on line again. I am not sure I would ever purchase them at all.
