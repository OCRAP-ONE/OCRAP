review/summary: it's salty
review/text: I started adding this to my drinking water in very small amounts because I heard that there were wonderful minerals etc. in it and that it might aid in a health condition (asthma).  All I really noticed was that for the first time in my life, my blood pressure went up (it's salt...duh).  I didn't use it for cooking.  I suspect for cooking a little would go a long way.

review/summary: Great Stuff/Easy to Mix and Use
review/text: I used this at a get together with the girls. It was fabulously easy to do. I believe it calls for Sour Cream to be added, but I always have to do things a bit of my ow way and mixed it up with half sour cream and half whipped cream cheese. I let it sit in the frige overnight in Tuppperware just to make absolutely certain that all the flavors mixed and it chilled well: the instructions advise at lease one hour if you are pushed for time.<br />The next AM, I capped two quarts of lucious strawberries and put them on a decorative platter and covered all with wrap until time for the ladies to come and the fun to begin. 15 minutes before game time, I put the StrawBerried Treasure (now adequately cooled with flavor mixed into the sour cream and cream cheese), in a delightfully pretty cut glass bowl, arrange the berries on the platter around the bowl of dip and set it out with the other snacks I had available.<br />The StrawBerried Treasure was the Hit of The Afternoon. No one could stand it until I had "given up" my secret..."Amazon ladies, of course"...and they all promptly headed home saying that they were ordering their packs right away.<br />It really was good. There was just a bit left over at the end of the afternoon and I took the dip and berries, put them on a smaller plate and plopped myself in front of the boob tube to relax after entertaining the afternoon away. (Such a rough life!) All alone, I cherished each bite that was left...just me, the dip and the berries. Well, the cats were there also,  but they soon discovered they had no taste for berries, though they were happy to grab a bite of dip from time to time. Truly it was great and I was thankful to find this. It is easy, fast, worth the price and makes you look like you have slaved all morning to produce such a delithful dip. So, I recommend it to all you harried party givers who need something fast and easy which makes you look like the Queen of the Kitchen. This is it! So, buy up!!!

review/summary: Strangely Addictive
review/text: I received these from my spouse because I probably would never have bought them myself. Honestly, I was not very excited to try these. I mean, it's candy. Not only is it candy, it's milk chocolate, and candy (especially milk chocolate) should be sweet.<br /><br />However, these chips bring together that perfect balance of savory versus sweet. Like chocolate covered pretzels, but better because they're potato chips! The little ridges help with the texture, I think that was key, or perhaps I am just biased towards ridged potato chips.<br /><br />This plays out as a balance between flavors and textures. Sweet vs salty. Crunchy versus smooth. These chips are fantastic. It's one of those things that your mind says no, but after thinking about it, realize that it was in fact, a great idea.

review/text: I fell in love with the chocolate version of these candies when a friend brought them back from a trip to Germany. A perfect combination of chocolate, cream, and crispy wafer. I thought I might prefer the hazelnut version since I'm not a chocolate lover, but in this case, the chocolate version is better because it offers a better balance of flavors.  The hazelnut cream and milk cream are too uniform, where the chocolate offers a better combination.  These aren't bad; I just prefer the chocolate.

review/text: This product seemed to be the perfect thing to have on hand for holiday appetizers, but the quality is nothing like many other salmon spreads I have tried.  Smells fishy, and my first reaction when I opened the can was a flashback to my days of cat ownership.<br /><br />I *might* use it in some other recipe in which I can mix it in, but I would not serve this with crackers to guests, ever.  I'm very disappointed, especially given the price, and the no returns policy, which leaves me with 5 cans of this stuff to find some acceptable way to use.

review/summary: Delicious, beautiful, and more economic than it sounds.
review/text: I tried this tea in a Teavana store where samples were available.  Not only is the blossom beautiful and exotic, but the tea is delicious.  It's smooth, uniform, and though delicate the peach flavor was definitely at the forefront.  I don't know if the pot I tried had been sweetened or not, but I was floored.  It's easily the best tasting tea I've ever tried (though admittedly that isn't saying much; I'm not a frequent tea drinker).<br /><br />The economic part comes in with the multiple infusions.  This isn't a makes-one-pot product; you can refill the pot and brew again with the same blossom and get multiple pots out of each 'ball.'

review/text: I originally tried this tea in the Teavana store, and was surprised at the wonderful scent. I'm not usually one for peach teas, but this was so mellow and fragrant, I couldn't pass it up. I didn't even realize it was a blooming tea until the gal at Teavana explained it to me.<br /><br />Not only does this tea taste good and is good for you, but it's beautiful, and more affordable than you'd think. The blossom it creates when you brew it is very pretty, it's half of why I drink it. And, each blossom is good for 5-6 brews, which means the 2 ounces in a pack (about 8 blossoms) is about 50 cups of tea. I use 1 blossom in Teavana's Perfect Tea Maker (the 16 ounce size) and I can fill the tea maker full 5-7 times before I consider the flavor and scent to be pretty diminished. For an artisan tea, that's an excellent value.

review/summary: An amazing tea
review/text: This was my first experience with blooming tea, and it made me into an enthusiastic believer!  My boyfriend had wanted me to look for chrysanthemum tea, without caffeine, at the new Teavana store at one of the local malls, and this was the tea I was told had the most chrysanthemum in it.  It looks absolutely beautiful when it blooms underwater, it smells wonderful, and it has a wonderful peach and jasmine flavor.  Unlike traditional teabags, teaballs can be used for at least three brewings, and one ball is even enough to brew an entire pot of tea.  This particular blooming tea might be on the pricy side for just two ounces, but in the long run it saves more money than getting a lot of teabags that might be cheaper but which can only be used for one cup of tea and still retain much flavor.  This tea still packs its full flavor after the first use and after the first day!  This was also my first time experiencing white tea, which, as it turns out, is lowest in caffeine of any of the other types of tea and is the highest in antioxidants.  And the fancy teaballs just make one want to brew this tea, since the presentation is so much prettier and more elegant-looking than a regular teabag, which one just throws in a cup of hot water.  It also helps that in Chinese culture, the chrysanthemum is believed to have the power to help a drinker to live to one hundred!

We don't have a glass tea kettle, but they had some blooming teas in one at a Teavana store, we visited and it is pretty! The other poster is correct about multiple uses too. We use each ball about 6 times (in a cup of tea, not a whole pot). I've found all of the Teavana tea yield multiple uses (generally at least 5 or 6).<br /><br />These teas are so yummy. We don't add any sweetener. They are just perfect as they are!

review/summary: Class Action Lawsuit pending for misleading information
review/text: Purchase with caution, this manufacturer has GROSSLY underestimated the calories, fat, and sodium in their dressing.  The Galeos label claims 14 calories and 1 gram of fat per tablespoon serving. That's where the problems start. The serving size required by federal law on dressing labels is 2 tablespoons, creating the illusion - even if those numbers were accurate - that the dressing outdoes other diet dressings.<br /><br />The laboratory showed the label should properly read: 120 calories, 11 grams of fat and 390 mg of sodium. The actual label claims 56 grams of sodium. Federal food labeling laws give companies a 20% margin of error.<br /><br />UPDATE (Nov.22): Here are the actual laboratory results before being broken down by serving size for Galeo's World's Best Miso Caesar:<br /><br />  * Carbohydrates, g/100g - 7.8013<br />  * Fat, g/100g - 38.32<br />  * Moisture, g/100g - 46.39<br />  * Protein, g/100g - 4.1387<br />  * Saturated Fat, g/100g - 6.0<br />  * Calories, g/100 g - 392.64<br />  * Total Sugars, g/100g - 7.35<br />  * Sodium, mg/100g - 1306

review/summary: Settlement, still worth buying
review/text: **UPDATE**<br />There is legal info on their website about the lawsuit.  From their side the calories were pretty close to their claim and the fat content was almost right on, but they didn't use the legal serving size.  They've corrected the label and have to do periodic testing as part of the settlement.  The correction isn't that far from what they originally claimed, but some users of the dressings claim the taste is different, worse, and they must have changed their recipe to make the calories/fat match the labels.  My own experience is that this is still a low-cal dressing and I still really like the taste.  I couldn't really tell a taste difference unless I had an old bottle to compare side-by-side, assuming it is actually different.  The plus for us is that we now know the label is correct, maybe even more reliably so than most other dressings.  So try it and like it, or don't.  I do still suggest not buying by the case, it just doesn't last long enough.  Also watch expiration dates in store carefully, lots of stores not good about rotating and this still isn't a big seller so it's more likely to sit longer.  I'm buying it though.  Bottom line is still taste and calories, which is great on both counts.

review/text: Class litigation should be illegal.  Maybe there was a time and place, but these days it's designed to just make lawyers richer.  It has nothing to do with product safety.  The people claiming to have had the dressing tested, by labs no less, did they mention if they used "FDA Approved labs or testing methods?"  No, didn't think so.  This is a California bunch doing this, you know, the land of litigation.  This is a prime reason why businesses and people are leaving the state in droves.  This practice is dishonest and should be outlawed, but in a state owned and operated by liberals, well...good luck.  Personally, I have to get out of here.  I am too damned honest to be a Californian.

review/summary: Breakfast Blend - Nothing Special
review/text: Long time Keurig user and lifetime coffee drinker.  Breakfast Blend is for the most part a plain cup of coffee.  Light and smooth, but with a slight bitterness at the end.  I still prefer Donut Shop as a light everyday go to coffee choice, but wanted to try a box of Green Mountain BB.  Probably won't purchase again.  No one in the house has stopped me and said, "thats a great cup of coffee".  It's just plain and blah.  I'll probably struggle to finish the box honestly.

review/summary: Fine, But There's Better Out There
review/text: The Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups are pretty decent.  The main selling point of this product is its price point.  Is it good coffee?  No, not really.  Is it good coffee for 60 cents a cup?  It sure can be.  These K-Cups taste good on both size settings of Keurig machines.<br /><br />I would like to point out though, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Donut Shop</a> brand of K-Cups are sold for the same price.  The Donut Shop coffee is a bit smoother in my opinion, and again, it's only 60 cents a cup.  Either way, the coffee you get won't be great, but it will be good for what you pay for.

review/text: I've purchased K-cups in a variety of blends and have learned that the batch to batch consistency isn't perfect.  But unlike some of the reviews of Green Mountain Breakfast Blend I've never had a bad batch of this blend.  If you enjoy a light roast this one seems perfect to me.  It is  available in both regular and decaf.  And for extra savings you may want to order the 50 count box from Amazon which is only $0.60/cup now.

review/text: The Green Mountain Breakfast Blend provides a perfect start for my mornings.  I do not like the strong robust blends that many prefer.  The Green Mountain Breakfast Blend is the perfect lighter blend to exactly match my needs for a cup of coffee to start my day. When I searched on Amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047RQ9M0">Green Mountain Coffee  Breakfast Blend,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 12-Count (Pack of 3)</a> for the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend and found it at a wonderful price for three twelve packs, I had to make the purchase.  I was not disappointed.  In a couple of days I received my order.  I am drinking a cup as I write. I enjoy the flavor of the coffee with just a little sweetener added. A perfect start to my day.

review/text: I typically prefer espresso when I drink coffee beverages. However, when my in-laws bought me the Keurig I decided to start drinking regular coffee. I enjoy Breakfast Blend because it is a rich, smooth coffee without being too acidic. I can make iced coffee out of it and it doesn't get too watered down or lose it's flavor (assuming I wait about 15 minutes after brewing for the coffee to cool before pouring it over ice).

review/text: My wife likes her coffee really weak and finding that in a K-cup has been a tough job. I like stronger coffees than the Breakfast Blend but I also enjoy this. It's still too strong for my wife but it's as close as I've been able to find to satisfy her taste (she adds water to every cup no matter which setting it's brewed on). I've been unable to find a "lighter" K-cup so we've been drinking this blend for years now. If anyone knows of a "weaker" K-cup coffee, let me know!

review/text: I love it! I received a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas and have been trying all the different flavors. While I enjoy a flavored coffee, I like my first cup of the day to be just "coffee". I've found the perfect one with Nantcket Blend. It's not too strong, not too weak. And the twin pack is a great value. Haven't found it at the grocery store so I'm very pleased to see it offered at Amazon. While I have a supply of various flavors, Nantucket Blend is my "go to" first thing in the morning. Best way to describe it? Smoooooooth.

review/summary: Nice mild coffee that still delivers a morning kick...
review/text: My days of enjoying bold, dark coffee times have long past. Maybe it's age, or maybe it was my time in the navy when midwatch coffee was always black and bitter, and the only thing that changed when the daywatch came around was a freshening of the grounds.<br /><br />This coffee is mild without being weak, and is a nice way to start the day (or finish up a meal and settle with a good book).<br /><br />Good choice for your K-cup pantry.

review/text: Really weak by my standards, I have to use the smallest volume on the Keurig to get decent flavor. Get extra bold cups instead if you don't like watery coffee.

review/text: This coffee is perfect for those who don't like strong coffee shop coffee.  It's mild yet has a bold flavor.  I actually make two cups with each k-cup.  That helps me save lots of money and works perfectly when I want more than one cup in the morning.  Second cup is lighter, but it still has good flavor.

review/summary: Not What Expected....
review/text: I ordered this coffee under the impression that it was a medium roast,that was according to the brief description & by zooming in the box on my laptop. On the the side of the box it stated medium. When the coffee arrived today it is not medium it is light. No medium on the box at all, just light. I am very disapointed with this purchase as I wanted at least a medium roast flavor. To be able to get a full flavor at all you will need to use a very small amount of water & make a very small cup of coffee. I'm sure I could send it back but the hassle is not worth it, but will not buy again. If you like extremely light coffee this is for you, if you like to taste your coffee this is No good. I will order bold from now on. As far as taste there is none unless you make about a 4 oz. cup even then it's not very good.<br />Amazon did ship very fast,I received the order sooner than expected & it was packaged very well.<br />Too bad the coffee was not what I ordered/ expected.

review/summary: Great Value
review/text: I purchased a Keurig single cup brewer for my elderly Mom and with that I sent her a large sample pack.  She pick the Breakfast Blend as her favorite.  This was a great deal so I sent it to her direct.  The K-Cups were all dumped in one box with not much packing protection.  I was sent an email from the company ahead of the delivery so I was aware and all was fine.

review/summary: MY FAVORITE K-CUP!
review/text: Green Mountain Breakfast Blend, is by far my favorite k-cup coffee!!! I was a die-hard Starbucks girl for years, and now that I live in a town without one-I use my Keurig daily. I don't like strong or dark coffees, so this one is nice and mild for me. I also use fat-free, flavored creamers and they taste great with this coffee blend. I also love getting this shipped to me fast on Amazon. The boxes that I found at Walmart, Kohl's, etc... had less kcups in them. I find that ordering them online via Amazon is a great value!

review/summary: Not my favorite Green Mountain
review/text: I don't know if I got a bad batch but this coffee has a nasty plastic flavor. I think the Nantucket Blend is good and the Dark Magic is excellent. My room mate tried it twice and she also thinks the Breakfast Blend is terrible.  Green Mountain makes some very good coffees but in my experience this isn't one of them.

review/summary: Perfect Breakfast Blend
review/text: This is my house's go to breakfast blend coffee.  Not too strong- but not weak we find the flavor very enjoyable and it a nice middle of the road coffee for guests.  My wife likes with cream and sugar but tastes equally at home black.  Doesn't seem to have a ton of pep- I can drink multiple cups in a sitting.  A little planning ahead (2 days with FREE PRIME shipping) and this package is a much better deal than the big boxes or supermakets.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Smooth taste but not very caffeinated
review/text: I got some samples of Green Mountain from BzzAgent, and I really liked it and the fact that I can have it pretty much instantly.  Only downside is that when I drink it I don't really feel that kick as if I had a lot of caffeine.  But it's great if you like the taste of coffee just for coffee's sake.

review/summary: Great all around taste!!!
review/text: I received some Green Moutain Coffee K-Cups as a sample test through Buzzagent and I was quite pleased with this.  It's not too strong of a coffee, but not too weak of a coffee either, it has a great blend of flavor.  It has a smooth taste and is not to bitter like some coffees tend to be.  Good price on this brand as well.  Overall I would have to say this a keeper for my morning ritual.

review/summary: FANTASTIC  !
review/text: Not too weak, not too strong, it's juuuuuust right<br />I found these first at my local supermarket. I've been looking for a blend that I could use as my standard every-day cup of coffee and, finally, this was it. I've tried so many of the other blends and brands and they were either harsh and bitter (I know, some people think coffee *should* taste that way!) or too bland and weak. This is smooth but with a nice "coffee"...<br /><br />~~~~~~Now if I could only get the decal breaskfast blend for the same price!~~~~~
