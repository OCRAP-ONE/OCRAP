review/summary: I just ruined the Earth
review/text: The actual cereal is fine, but why on Earth do I need individual packets of it?  I thought I was buying the large box (like the one I bought at Whole Foods).  Instead it was 12 boxes containing individual packets of cereal.  Obviously I should have read the description more closely, but I'm sleep deprived.  The carbon footprint on this is just insane!

review/text: Packaged arrived dented, and most if not all 4 variety bags of cookies were clumped, in pieces and crumbly. I use to get these at WFMarket, and they were just fine. However, it's been extremely hot across the country, and add in the reckless shipping carrier (no AC on trucks). These cookies really need to be kept in a cool environment. Oh well, what can you do. Too bad, I really do love these cookies.

review/text: We had a guy bring a dozen of these little jewels on a hunting trip and I almost hiked out in order to find more. I usually put in over 300 hours a year hunting and fishing and I am always searching for the right snack to pack. The Lil' Chub is not loaded with sugar which will make you crash and it's small enough that you don't over indulge. A hand full of crackers and one Lil' Chub will get through 3 or 4 hours without hunger. I can't wait to order them from Amazon. In 30 years of being in the outdoors --- THIS IS BEST SNACK IDEA I HAVE EVER SEEN...

Just one of these things at a party provides a whole night of endless jokes and witty banter. The Lil Chub is also pretty much the definition of great white elephant gift exchange gift. And with Valentine's right around the corner, this could be the key to that special someone's heart...and maybe more!

review/summary: Good quality water biscuits
review/text: These Wellington Cracked Pepper Water Crackers are of good quality, made of winter wheat in Canada. They have evenly-distributed flecks of mild black pepper that lend a very subtle peppery taste to the usual plain table water cracker. They are evenly baked but a bit darker around the edges than in the photo on the box.<br /><br />I always like to keep some water biscuits on hand as sometimes no other cracker will do. They were also my great-grandfather's and my grandmother's favorite crackers. I prefer them to bread to serve with good cheese.<br /><br />I have not bought these from Amazon and it would be interesting for someone to comment on whether they arrive in good condition or broken from shipping.<br /><br />Serving size: 4 Crackers (15 g)<br />Servings per container: about 8<br />The box has 4.4 oz or 125 g total and I have found that there are usually 36 crackers in the box, not 32.<br /><br />Each serving has 60 calories and not much else:<br />Total fat - 1 g<br />Sodium - 65 mg<br />Total carbohydrates - 11 g<br />Protein - 1 g<br /><br />Ingredients: Enriched wheat flour, canola oil and/or sunflower oil, cracked black pepper, salt, sugar, ascorbic acid and citric acid.<br /><br />Note the product description on this page is for the sesame crackers not the cracked pepper variety and they give the origin as Australia instead of Canada.

review/summary: Wished the expiration date was out longer...
review/text: Love twix and since I can never really find it in my area I thought I would buy it from Amazon. Great price for a box of 24 the only gripe I have is that the expiration date is right around the corner - meaning I have to start eating these things NOW!!! I would have appreciated at least a year expiration time but I only have close to 30 days to eat 24 bars. I like to eat my candy in a casual setting not in a rushed setting - but we live and learn. I took three stars away for that reason and for the reason below.<br /><br />UPDATE: I contacted the seller over 3 weeks ago to complain about the expiration dates and they have not returned my emails or even let me know they were concerned. They sell OLD STOCK that is expiring soon. I would not advise to buy from them and I would and will not buy from them at all again.

review/summary: Great superfood energy to go
review/text: I'm a competitive long distance runner, and have recently been taking powdered spirulina given the research that shows how it not only enhances endurance in athletes, but also has cancer-fighting properties and is a complete protein for vegetarians. Anyway, having the powder in smoothies and puddings becomes messy and cumbersome, not to mention sometimes the taste can be funky. These bars are made with dates and agave syrup so they are sweet and with a nice nutty flavor. really great for a snack after a workout or on the go. The downside is the are teeny-tiny and rather unsatisfying. But they did that to make the 100 calorie limit. Overall, recommended.

The Vegetable Beef flavor I have not seen in grocery stores.  Knowing how much we like the Chicken and the Tomato Parm Bisque, I thought this would be great.  I also love Campbell's original Vegetable Beef soup.  This has almost no flavor.  Understanding that it's a 'drinkable' soup, I didn't expect many pieces of veggies or beef, but I thought the flavor would be there.  In order to not waste the ones I have purchased, I add a packet of concentrated Beef Broth to each cup, so that it has SOME flavor.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2AO">Savory Choice Liquid Beef Broth Concentrate, 5.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Exceptional Product
review/text: My three year old Scottie has been fighting allergies since before his first birthday. Rx strength shampoos, topical and injected cortisone, and antihistamines, nothing seemed to bring him relief. During a vet recommended visit to an allergy specialist one of the vet techs suggested I try an elimination diet with a grain free food to rule out food allergies. I spent several weeks searching and discovered the FirstMate website. What did I have to lose? My pup was miserable. I ordered a 14.5 pound bag of Pacific Ocean Fish and after easing into a full change of diet, I threw away any foods/treats that contained grains. Taste, texture and smell seem to delight Duffy and he crunches his dinners with delight. Within two months the scratching, rubbing and licking had all but ended. We still have the occasional seasonal pollen/spore flare up, but these are easily controlled with medicated shampoo. Duffy's coat is shiny, he is happy and healthy and best of all he can take a walk without timeout for scratching.

They were all packaged so well that as the plants came out of the box they looked as though we had taken them off a shelf at our local nursery. Although the plants came in 4" pots, they are large enough to be transplanted into larger decorative pots and set out for display and enjoyment. And as they thrive in average household lighting, I have put them throughout our home to brighten each room and help clean the air. I will be ordering from Hirt's again and would recommend this vendor to everyone.

review/text: This would be SO much better if it was left as whole beans rather than ground because I prefer to grind my coffee fresh every morning.  Ground coffee goes stale entirely too fast, even when kept in an airtight container.  I would definitely use the subscription method of ordering, if only this was whole bean!

review/summary: Trying a different food
review/text: Because our Rottweiler has some skin issues, we are trying the ProPlan Selects Natural Salmon and Brown Rice food. We are beginning our 3rd bag via subscribe and save. So far, our dog likes it and we haven't had enough time to know if its doing better than the Blue Buffalo we used before. I am thinking of adding Salmon oil.<br /><br />The only negative we have is the kibble is small. My dog sometimes gets choked on the little kibble, so I am going to try and stick with this form, but find a larger kibble. Overall, this is a great food.

review/summary: Annual Holiday Treat
review/text: Every year my Italian godmother gives me a box of these candies for Christmas and I have to work hard not to devour them within the day.  Within the box, one third are lightly orange flavored torrone, one third vanilla, and one third mildly lemon flavored - all are excellent, soft nougat (that unfortunately leave you wanting another one!).  Glad to know I can order them myself online, now, for the months in-between!

review/summary: Nostalgia as well as nougat
review/text: It was by chance I stumbled on to this candy, thanks to a friend who chose an Italian Restaurant for us in Portland, Oregon today.  (And a right fine restaurant it is too, I might add.) I did not think any of the wonder from Christmas as a girl could come rushing back so profoundly.  But there was this candy.  We Italians, of course, were Catholic.  We were poor as my parents were first generation, and so only had this candy at Christmas.  In its cute, well actually, very lovely artisticaly pleasing, boxes.  Because we took Holy Communion and the wafers from the priest's hands to our tongues were the same egg white as what coated these candies, it was like the candy held so much more meaning.  I would lift off the egg white and ponder the signifiance of Communion and how the candy was also a bit Holy.  Little kids and their ideas.  I had not seen it in fourty or more years (I am 61).  By chance, a friend and I were talking about it with relish (pun intended) only a week ago.  Where have we been?  It's been here (in the universe) all along!  I didn't remember the name but she and I both remembered the candy.  I can't WAIT to give her some.  YIPEE!  My parents, and all of their generation are gone now, but thanks to this discovery and ability to gift my friends, they have been resurrected emotionally again.

review/summary: One bite brought back some great memories!
review/text: These are exactly the candies I've been craving for so long.  A million years ago when the earth was still cooler, once a week I'd walk with my dad to the delicatessen and he'd buy me some while he waited for those yummy cold cuts.  My favorite part was the thin paper-like wafer that would stick to my gums then quickly melt. Then I'd bite into a thick nougat loaded with almonds and slowly chew every morsel.  Probably why my parents let us have these since it kept us kids quiet while they shopped!<br /><br />The La Florentine is close to what I remember though I was looking for the originals in the blue box.  I found them -- Ferrara -- from the same vendor and ordered both.<br /><br />They're both loaded with almonds and same-texture nougat; not too chewy but doesn't fall apart or crumble unless you force it to.  Each square is 1" x 1.3/4" x .1/2(thick) Perfect size for a sweet pick-me-up. Each box comes with Vanilla, Orange, and Lemon flavors.  I started with Vanilla and have to wait awhile for the next taste but expect them to be just as wonderful. Minute they arrived I ripped open the boxes and started remembering why I loved them so much.<br /><br />The La Florentine's are the sweeter of the two but that doesn't mean the other brand isn't sweet or any good.  The Ferrara is actually in the range I prefer, more the "touch of sweet" as I love nougat but only want sugary-sweet sometimes.  Getting both was a great idea and covers all moods!<br /><br />My next order to Fine Products will be the hard candies, especially the Anise, Liquore, Caffe, and the Gran Mix that I might share with others. I'll probably have to buy 2 of each so I can have my own :)

review/summary: A Wonderful Italian Tadition
review/text: My husband's family is Italian and these candies are an annual Christmas treat. They are very delicious and not overly sweet. The nougat is delightful and the flavors are very refreshing. The little bits of almond in each one makes an especially good contrast between the slightly chewy nougat and the crunch of the nuts. I love the lemon ones and as with the other reviewer have to stop myself from over indulging.

review/summary: Just as I remembered!!
review/text: As soon and I opened one of these little gems I was transported back to my childhood when I spent my summers with my beloved Nonna.<br />My grandma had a store in Bridgeport Ct. I loved going there, It was one of those stores that had a grocery department in the front  and in the back was a butcher, there was saw dust on the floor and fish and hardware splattered around, on the counter my grandma would keep, under the rows of Italian sausage and big balls of aging chees, a basket full of Perugino nougat candy just like this one. Although these are not the same brand the are good enough to bring back fond memories of my times with my grandma.<br />I would come in and call out "Ciao Nonna" and she would come and kiss my cheep and grab a couple of candies tell me how much she loved me and tap my bottom and send me on my way with my treat.<br /><br />I just cannot stop eating these, they are not exactly like the ones I remember, because it has been a very long time and tastes have changed but these are just as soft and sweet, chewy and still has nice crispy almonds.  If the almonds are stale they would be soft and chewy, not good.  I love these I am just happy they do not sell them around the corner I would be in trouble.<br />If you have never tried this unbelievable nougat candy you are missing something give them a try you will not be sorry.

review/text: I had these as a child over 50 years ago.  They were a favorite of my Italian grandmother.  These are as close as I have ever found to those from the family, even to the little boxes and pictures on them.<br /><br />The candies themselves are more consistently soft and chewy - we always had a few that had dried out and became too stiff.  Modern packaging probably helps a lot.<br /><br />The only issue is size.  These are still the same size of box as I remember, but over the years the treats themselves have shrunk to the point that they fill only a small fraction of the space available.  Too bad, I would rather pay a bit more and get a properly sized treat.

Big mistake.. It is as stale as stale can be. Ugly. Threw it out, and will proceed with more caution in the future. And of course, never buy this brand again, no matter the season. They should have not offered it in this terrible condition.

review/text: I began drinking this tea as soon as I was out of my first trimester (I'm nearly done with my second now).  I was warned that it might not taste so good but I love it.  It has a nice minty flavor that resembles the regular peppermint teas that are available.  There is also a natural lemon flavor added according to the box but I really don't taste it that much.  I don't need sweeteners or anything and it isn't a chore at all to drink the 3 daily cups.  I also bought the red raspberry leaf tea and I will add that once my due date is closer.<br /><br />This has actually become one of my favorite teas overall, and I do enjoy hot tea.  I might continue drinking it after my pregnancy because the ingredients are used to support womens' health overall.

It is hard to say if it did any good.  I was in labor for 80 hours with my son, which resulted in a c-section... but that was due to him being in a poor position.  I don't think it did any harm by any means and I will drink it again when I get pregnant again.

review/text: This is a very tasty tea, but you should be very careful if you are pregnant.  I decided to check the ingredients before drinking it.  As it turns out, there is some debate regarding the very first ingredient, raspberry leaf.  It is unclear whether this is safe early in a pregnancy, or whether it should only be used at the end...when trying to induce labor.  Rather than take any chances, I threw the stuff out!<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should warn people not to consume this during early pregnancy, or at least advise of the risks.  The advertising is irresponsible, in my view.  No more Yogi products for me.

review/text: This tea is marketed to pregnant women as safe.  At least two of the ingredients (raspberry leaf and fennel seed (aka Anise)) are definite no-no's for pregnant women.  They both can cause uterine contractions which could lead to miscarriage or premature labor.  This tea tastes great, and if you just want a nice herbal tea to drink that may promote (non-pregnant) women's health, this is a great option, but beware if you are pregnant.  I'm not sure why this company would ever market this as safe for pregnancy- a simple google search or talk with a doctor will tell you to stay away from those ingredients if you are pregnant!

review/summary: Good for making Th&eacute; &agrave; la menthe
review/text: I ordered this to make Algerian (or Moroccan) mint tea (Th&eacute; &agrave; la menthe) and it worked very well.  The tea has a nice mild flavor and was very fresh.  Mint tea is just gunpowder green tea and fresh mint, sweetened to taste with ample sugar, and usually served in small glasses rather than tea cups from a special tea pot, often raised high in the air to aerate the tea as it is poured.  I make mine in a regular pot, and pour from a regular height, but it seems to taste just as good.

review/summary: The picture threw me off.
review/text: This mix just arrived today, so I can't comment yet on the quality of the product.  However, when I ordered it, I had no idea how it was going to arrive.  The picture in the listing shows a mound of loose powder.  I thought perhaps I'd get an unlabeled plastic bag with 5 pounds of mystery scone powder in it.  Instead, the Krusteaz Mix is packed in paper similar to the way they package 5-pound bags of flour or sugar.  It's fully labelled as a Krusteaz product. Then Amazon put the paper bag into a plastic  bag for shipping.  Just thought I'd share this in case anyone else is wondering.

review/summary: Good Product but National Pet Pharmacy Ripped Me Off
review/text: This is what National Pet Pharmacy does to con you into buying a smaller bag at a ridiculous price:<br />I was looking for a 40 pound bag of Science Diet Sensitive Stomach Dog Food.  What I found was that the price Petco and others charge on Amazon and what National Pet Pharmacy charges for the bag plus shipping is almost the same.  So I figure I'll save a couple bucks and go with National Pet Pharmacy.  What I didn't realize was that they have this little trick where they put their 20 pound bag up at a similar price that other sellers sell their 40 pound bag for.  So they price their 20 pound bag (which they hope people will mistake for a 40 pound bag - like me, haha) a couple bucks cheaper than the others charge for their 40 pound bag.  So when you shop around if you're not careful you'll assume they're the best deal for the 40 pound bag at a price a few bucks cheaper.  Then you get the box from them and it's the 20 pound bag that you realized you paid way too much for. I just sent it back but of course now I'm out the shipping both ways.  So much for the hours spent finding the cheapest dog food online.  I'll just go to J&B's from now on.

review/summary: Deceptive little buggers
review/text: I opened the snack cabinet in the office today and found something new: Sun Maid Vanilla Yogurt Raisins. I thought they might be a moderately healthy supplement to my boring lunch, so I opened a box and popped a few in my mouth.  The raisins were plumper than the normal desiccated Sun Maid product, but the yogurt coating was sweet but not distinctive tasting and had a weirdly slick texture after being chewed a couple times. Noting this, I idly checked the ingredients while I waited for my tea to warm up in the microwave. Natural California Raisins, check. Yogurt coating... with partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil. Hmm. The obverse of the box yielded the devilish Nutrition Fact I was looking for: One box of these demons contains 4 grams of saturated fat, or 20% of the recommended daily value.<br /><br />These things are moderately tasty, but for that amount of saturated fat, I want to cram something absolutely delicious in my cake hole (like cake?). I would not recommend these to anyone, and I would definitely never give them to my children thinking they were some kind of healthy snack.

review/summary: Contains trans fat, sugar, and saturated fat
review/text: This product contains Trans Fat (e.g. hydrogenated palm kernel oil), a lot of Saturated Fat, and added sugar (e.g. Sugar, Corn syrup, and Maltodextrin). My wife bought me a package of these because I love cherries; however, I will not buy them again because of the preservatives, fat, and sweeteners added to an otherwise healthy product. This is far from a healthy product. The taste was not bad, but it did taste as these were sitting on a shelf for a while (they had a 'musty' taste), even though the expiration was almost a year away (May 24, 2011). I will probably end up buying a de-pitting food processor and just buy cherries from a 'pick you own' farm next year and make my own because I refuse to keep subjecting myself to bad products. I will also look at Sunmaid raisens that my son eats more closely now after this company unethically puts preservatives in their products to extend shelf life.

review/summary: Tasty treat
review/text: This cake was super easy to make. It tasted great and had an absolutly awesome texture. The "mouth feel" of the cake is nothing like most microwaved treats. Even people who regularly eat wheat would be very surprised this is a wheat free and microwave product give the taste and texture.<br /><br /> The texture is very soft and light and not at all grainy. The cake tastes like a cinnamon donut in terms of degree of sweetness and the cinnnamon flavor is very authentic and high quality tasting. The cake delivers a completely authentic cake experience but you should know it is not supper pretty to look at and does not come with any topping as might be suggested by the label art. If you are giving it as a special treat to someone, as a birthday cake for instance, you might want to spread some gluten free icing or whipped cream cheese on it to improve the aesthetic effect.<br /><br />This would be a great purchase to keep in the pantry as an "emergency treat" or to keep at work as a courtesy maybe if you are doing a birthday and it turns out someone is on a gluten free diet. Really what this kit is perfect for is when you are at a motel with a microwave, to send with a child going on a sleepover at someone else's house, or to leave with grandparents as an easy treat to give gluten free grandchildren.

It's quick, easy, tastes great (I add butter once cooked...I know, gilding the lily a bit! :) and the texture is great for gluten free! (note: Stay away from their hambuger buns, however....they were horrible!) Be sure and keep the baking container, as it looks like you can order just the refills without the container for a cheaper price.

review/text: I am in love with these little coffee cakes!  They are so simple to make, and absolutely delicious.  Sometimes you just want something sweet...a little cake--not to mention something that tastes fantastic--and these fit the bill.  It's so simple to shake up the batter in the baking container, and then you pop it in the microwave for a minute, and you have a delicious  little cake.  I haven't ever tried it, but, if you wanted to be really evil, you could mix-up a little powdered sugar and milk icing and drizzle that over the top.  These are easy to take with you to work, or to a party, as well.  I know it sounds a little goofy, but, when I'm going to someone else's house for dinner, the one thing I usually have to stay away from is dessert, and this is a simple solution that let's me join in the fun of that course, as well.  I highly recommend these.

I don't break the egg or disturb it in anyway.  I allow that to cook, then enjoy it!  It's quick, healthy, and tasty.

review/text: It's a big bag of dog food, just like it says.  My dog was on the Prescription Diet for sensitive stomachs, but she has adjusted to this food pretty well and it is easier to get (doesn't require a trip to the vet) and cheaper.  Give it a shot.

review/text: I made the mistake of trying to switch my dog (large breed boxer) to one of the currently trendy "grain-free" dogfoods... and he did not thrive at all.  Loose stools, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, etc.  6 long months of misery for both of us before vet recommended this food.  It solved all of his digestive problems; his weight is getting back to normal and his coat is shiny.  He feels better too - lots of energy, doesn't have to potty as often, etc.  Really happy I found a dogfood that is so gentle on his stomach.
