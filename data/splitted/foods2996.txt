review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

review/text: I love Valerian and I love it's earthy smell! But just because a previous reviewer hated the smell and threw a tantrum, (which is ironic because Valerian is used for its relaxing properties) doesn't mean it doesn't work! Keep that in mind when making your decision to purchase a natural product! Valerian is not like raw garlic! It's simply a very safe and effective herb which, to me, has a wonderful smell!

review/text: You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.  It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.<br /><br />You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!

review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

China is a country that has sent us poison toohpaste and dog food and makes use of prison labor. From undermining breastfeeding worldwide, to the implicit condoning of slavery in the production of raw ingredients such as cocoa to importing juice of questionable safety into America, a nation awash in apples; there is no bottom for Nestle. I'd rather buy juice from British Petroleum - at least they don't use slave labor.

With most bottled 100% fruit juices, I'm able to dilute almost 50/50% with water and still enjoy the juice.  In this case, it's a bit too diluted at 50/50%.  Had it been a bit more concentrated like some other brands, it would have received five stars.<br /><br />Again - it's very good - a nice blend.  And the price was outstanding, particularly with free shipping.  Would we buy again?  Absolutely.  And if you like your juice without any dilution straight out of the bottle, this will be just fine - even with some ice melting in the same glass.  I dilute mine on top of already having ice in the glass, and it's still not too bad.

review/summary: Yep, Funky Alright
review/text: I guess I should have paid more attention to the other reviews- these have a really odd taste and an even worse aftertaste- I agree with another person who said they tasted like they were fried in rancid oil.  My kids love freeze-dried bananas (used to be able to get them at Trader Joes, but haven't seen them in awhile) as well as the apples, peaches, pineapples, etc.  So they are not strangers to dried fruits, and usually like them.  These- not so much. My 18-mo old who usually eats anything turned them down- that's saying something! I'm still trying to get the taste out of my mouth, its just not right; the acai (which I know I've had in other things and have liked just fine) totally takes over the banana and aside from the texture, you wouldn't know it's banana in there.  Now I've got 11 bags that will be going in the trash, and that's $12.00 I won't get back. Bummer.  Other flavors (I also ordered Purple Pinapple and had the Carnival Mix) are yummy, but this one just is too funky for this family.

review/summary: My Latest Addiction!!!
review/text: I am totally addicted to the Funky Monkey!!!  I started with the Jiva Lime, then the Purple Funk started growing on me, and now I crave it every day!  I also love the Bananamon, but mostly when I have run out of Purple Funk!  I love that it is organic and totally natural.  I don't care if it does stick in my teeth, so does candy, and I'm MUCH better off with these than indulging my serious sweet tooth in less healthy ways!  To me, these ARE like candy.  :-D  I am SO happy I found this brand, I just can't find a regular enough supplier so I guess I have to start ordering them online now.  About the cost- come on, three servings of totally organic fruit for under two dollars and someone is complaining?  As a former medical researcher, I understand the VALUE of such a quality, organic, nutritious, delicious, awesome product and I am quite obviously sold.  ;-)  P.S.  I do not work for the company, or anywhere else for that matter- I am just a fan of the Funk!

review/summary: Does taste funky!
review/text: I was first introduced to freeze dried fruits on a visit to Kennedy Space Center in FL - it was a novel item then, and it was great to know that this is what astronauts eat when they're in space.<br /><br />Then I started to order Gerber Graduates freeze dried fruits for my toddler & I've grown to love it as a guilt-free dessert/snack for me & the family. When my local grocery store stopped carrying it, I looked here & thought I found the perfect substitute! Boy was I wrong...<br /><br />It does taste extremely funky and there's a weird aftertaste. It tastes rancid, like it was somehow fried in oil that was used a couple dozen times (it's not suppoed to be fried though). I wonder why the average review is so high? Maybe employees are the ones leaving reviews? It's not the first time that has happened  ;)<br /><br />I guess my search isn't over.

review/text: Both of my children have multiple food allergies, so it's hard to find something I don't have to make on my own. The ingredients labeled were items both of my children could eat, so I bought a case of Banana/cinnamon and Purple Funk. Both children got severe diarrhea and one additionally threw up several times after eating a little of both. (they shared each others bags).<br />Don't know what is in the processing or what grade of food they are using (GMO or older fruits). I looked on their site and didn't see any solid information. Mostly "cutesy" links. I'm not thrilled that I can't return the unused bags because they are "grocery" items. I wouldn't give these to any of my friends or children's schools.

review/summary: Good, except for damaged cans.
review/text: Below is a letter I wrote to customer services at friskies.com I don't think this is an amazon.com issue, since the damage is not to the amazon.com shipping-box or to the Friskie's packaging-box that the cat food is contained in. My guess is that damaged-cans must happen during the canning part of the process?  (Besides this issue, the feline-companion here enjoys this seafood blend).<br /><br />Here's my note to Friskies.com:<br /><br />Hi,<br /><br />I order a box of Friskies Prime Filets Seafood Selections Variety Pack, Seafood, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)<br /><br />I buy a lot of cat products over the internet, mainly places like amazon.com<br /><br />The box I received, from amazon.com, was in good condition, as was the packaging box that holds the cans of cat food. But, inside the box, 5 of the 24 cans were badly damaged.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this might have happen? My only guess is that the cans were placed into the packaging box "damaged", then sent to amazon.com, that unknowingly  placed them into shipping-box that was then shipped to me.

review/text: I'm saving at least one 16 mile round trip to get catfood (the cats hate the pate catfood that seems to be the normal type stocked by stores within walking distance) by ordering this.  However, there does seem to be some denting going on although in my case it was minor and the seal does not appear to be broken.  It did involve six cans though and both the company packaging and the Amazon box were both undamaged.  I probably wouldn't have even noticed it if other reviews hadn't mentioned it.<br /><br />Yeah, I know, I'm a bad cat owner. It's really a good thing I didn't have kids.

I live in New York and this cat food is nearly 50 percent more expensive in local stores here than it is on Amazon, so although I found it strange ordering cat food online, it is more economical for me to purchase it this way. None of my cans were dented which seems to have been a problem for other reviewers. I can't comment on the dent problem that seems to plague these shipments but mine was fine! Go figure! Oh, and as for the quality of the food, it's fine. I know it's nothing special and has lots of fillers but I'm a student on a budget and my cat is an ex-feral anyways; she doesn't need any fancy raw meat diet or something. I eat like crap too, because I have no money. My cat eats this food and always cleans her plate. 5/5 stars.

review/summary: Canned Cat Food was Very Popular with our New Cats
review/text: Addressing the other reviews about crushed and dented cans : all the cans in my case were all in perfect shape.<br /><br />I have only bought Friskies cat food after most of the other 'high quality' pet food companies got caught buying tainted chinese protein. That caused a lot of dead pets. My cats were safer buying Friskies than the more expensive stuff sold at the vet and at the pet stores.<br /><br />This cat food was new to two seven month old adopted strays. Since getting them home from the Humane Society, they have shown an interest in canned cat food, but nothing crazy. This stuff stood out as very different though. They completely emptied their bowls and begged for more. They have not done that on any other type of canned food, so I thought it was worth a mention.

review/summary: Now this is a smart way to buy canned cat food
review/text: Imagine only paying $13.00 for 24 cans of cat food.  I pay $18.99 plus sales tax at my local Walmart and a bit more at the local grocery store.  I like the fact that I can subscribe and have the food delivered as often as needed straight to my door with no sales tax or shipping and handling.  The only problem I have encountered is a lack of flexibility as to the shipping date.  I only get paid once a month and I have to wait until the money goes into my checking account somewhere between the 5th and 9th of each month.  Amazon.com ships the food on the 4th of each month.  I have sent an email to Amazon requesting a different shipping date.  I know that I will soon receive an answer because Amazon.com customer service is awesome!  My five cats really like the Friskies canned cat food and getting two different variety boxes with 24 cans each lasts for 3-4 months.

My usually-finicky Bengal goes nuts when I open a can.<br /><br />I used to bust out the Friskies solely as a reward, or a technique for getting her to eat the healthier food (by mashing it all together in one bowl), but she's winning that particular war. She'll literally eat her way around the healthier fare.<br /><br />Best if used sparingly, but judged on the basis of feline enthusiasm, it's a winner.

review/text: Like others, I had a big problem with dented cans. Some were just a little bit dented and I used those, but others could have had a compromised seal and two looked like the Hulk had crushed them in his hand. The packaging for one case had a bit of a dent on one corner, but the other one had pristine packaging and still had dents in over half the cans. I contacted Amazon and they gave me a partial refund for the cans that were unusable. I have never had this problem with the other Prime Filets that I usually order (they were out of stock a while ago, which is why I ordered these instead).

review/summary: Perfect Product, you won't be disappointed.
review/text: Perfect condition. Rapid delivery. Front door service. No dings or dents. No delivery charges. Pop tops (no can opener needed). What more could you ask for?  5 STARS in my opinion!  I mix this into my 3 DOGS dry food with hot water. It adds a nice gravy, softens the food, & adds the fish oil which makes their fur soft & shiney. I'm NOT a vet, so only do this on your own accord. But they seem to LOVE it, then so do I.

review/summary: Did someone say finicky?
review/text: For years my cats would only eat pate.  Now, suddenly, one older guy who prefers dry sees the joy of shredded and all but one love meaty bits and prime filets. My one old man (17 yrs) still wants his pate, so so it's variety at mealtime in my house.  Friskies and Amazon sure help.  As far as pricing, at this writing, Amazon sends emails if the price changes when they are sending. As a consumer, I check regularly to see if the higher priced foods have come down in price and order them immediately.  Grocery store and pet store prices are much higher than Amazon and charge tax; plus I have to drive there and haul food to and from my car.  No fun for me.  And my cats love watching the boxes arrive at the door for THEM!  Damaged food?  Amazon has an awesome return policy.  Use it!  Just wish they had more food and stopped changing the pricing like a yoyo.  But having food for my 7 cats that lasts a little over 4 months works for me!

review/summary: Not bad, but a little pricey
review/text: After reading some reviews here that reflect the price of cat food in other states, I feel less likely to complain that they were just raised to $.50 a can!  My cat really likes two of the three flavors in this pack, particularly the beef and salmon.  He's a toothless wonder and they fillets sometimes give him a bit of trouble in the chewing department, but he loves the flavor so much he just swallows most of it whole.  They contain a good deal of gravy too which he loves, but again, the hunks of meat are larger in the fillet variety so if you have a toothless wonder like mine, you might want to keep that in mind.  This is pretty pricey here too - paid about six dollars for this same package here locally.  Great stuff, highly recommend!

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are for one of the flavors: turkey, poultry by-products, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. Another flavor was: water sufficient for processing, chicken, and liver. At least there is turkey and/or chicken in it, but other than that its mostly nasty stuff. By-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats, and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Some Friskies flavors are even worse than the ones I listed and contain no real meat. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.

Now I can get the quality of the PRIME filets, the convenience of home delivery and knowing that once a month they will have the food they enjoy instead of me coming home with a substitute, and a decent price (which does not take into consideration the gas, car, or my time to go get it!). I agree with the other customer who said, "now this is the way to shop!" Come and get it!!!!

Accidentally, I found this in Amazon and since then meal time with my baby is fun. She enjoys this flavour very much and this is definitely better and nutritios than Gerber or Earth's best brands. I dont understand why Nestle has not entered this market in the USA, eventhough they market breast milk supplements like good start. My daughter would never eat the gerber brand cereals before and would be very fuzzy throughout the meal time. Cerelac is definitely a life saver.

Cerelac has a finner texture and it tastes sweeter than other cereals, so I also give Cerelac mixed with rice and oatmeal cereals to my babies, so they will eat better.

review/text: "Jamacian Mountain Peak" Instant coffee has won a "Monde Selection" award, (Luxembourg, 1990), and has an impressive<br />reputation.  I have seen "Jamacian Blue Mountain" ccffee featured in a "By Appointment To The King of _____", famous mail-order coffee company.  This would be the GROUND coffee version, (they don't, sadly, offer any instant coffee in this famous mail-order house....although I have, several times, asked them to do so), but the fact is that their "Jamacian Blue Mountain" coffee is not only a "by appointment to Royalty" coffee....but it is also on their "specialty" list, and can only be ordered at certain times of the year!  "Jamacian Blue Mountain" coffee is also listed in the book, "100 Things To Buy Before You Die", (by Maggie Davis).  It is NOT the first choice in coffees, (that belongs to 'kopi lewca' coffee....which is produced with the help of certain insects), but IS choice Number 2.<br /><br />So, when I saw what looks to be, (both from name and description), an INSTANT COFFEE version of Jamacian Blue Mountain coffee, instant-coffee-drinking me could NOT resist it!<br /><br />Looking at the coffee before opening it, I noticed that this is a TRUE instant coffee....quite powdery, with no hint of the larger granules one finds in freeze-dried instant coffee.  In the jar, it is a surprisingly light brown -- almost a hazelnut coolour, much lighter than most other instant coffees.  If you look closely, SOME of the granules seem to sparkle, just a bit, as the light hits them.  I remember hearing about "flavour crystals" in another brand of instant coffee, (forget which one at the moment), but also remember calling up the oompany, and discovering that "flavour crystals" were created by the way the coffee granules are cut....<br /><br />The suggested tags for this coffee include "organic coffee" -- and though I believe that a coffee with this much reputation MUST be organically grown, the words "Organic" or "CertIfied Organic", appear no-where on the bottle's label.  Strange.....<br /><br />Anyway, though I usually blend all my instant coffees together, (dry), in a cannister, to get my own unique blend, (and also to disguise the taste of instant coffees I have bought and do not like, (such as Cafe Bustelo, Instant Decaffeinated Espresso coffee, which I found too strong and bitter), I decided to honour JAMACIAN MOUNTAIN PEAK instant coffee, and its reputation, by using it, and it alone, io make at least the first few cups of this coffee....<br /><br />I found the taste to be very, very mild.  (It is no accident, that JACOB'S CRONAT GOLD instant cofee is sold by Amazon, as an option, with Jamacian Mountain Peak Instant Coffee...as it too, has a very mild flavour.)  If you like MILD coffee, Jamacian Montain Peak Coffee should definitely be your choice.  Jacob's Cronat Gold, (for which I have also written a review for Amazon), is excellent, mild coffee as well -- but this Jamacian Mountain Gold coffee, when imbibed, has surprising, fleeting moments of a darker, richer flavour on the tongue, amongst most of the moments, which impart a pleasing mildness....<br /><br />As someone who prefers a somewhat darker and richer blend, (my favourite -- though lazy me doesn't make it too often -- is regular, ground French Roast coffee), I found I had to add TWO rounded teaspoons of Jamacian Mountain Peak instant coffee to my 16 ounce coffee cup, to get even an approximation of coffee flavour...at least, coffee flavour as I like to drink it.  Doing this, the Jamacian Mountain Peak coffee did have a very pleasant taste -- but a very mild one.  It reminded me, somewhat, of a sweet and innoent girl making her society debut.  Nothing loud, strong or raucaus, just a pleasant, mild sweetness -- not unpleasant at all, but not that mature, either.....<br /><br />I intend to have a cup or two of Jamacian Mountain Peak instant coffee mixed with my favourite instant coffee -- Taster's Choice Original.  To my American taste, I suspect that the two will be perfect together.  Or, perhaps, mixed with an instant coffee I have also liked, but found a little too strong and bitter for my tastes -- Taster's Choice Gourmet Maragor Bold.  Tge rich, dark flavour of the Taster's Choice Instant Maragor Bold, and the delicate, warm flavour of the Jamacian Mountain Peak instant coffee should go very well together, I think!  A "marriage" of two great instant coffees! I think they'll have their "honeymoon" in Jamacia!  (When I buy the Taster's Choice Maragor Bold Instant coffee, and mix it with the item here being reviewed, I'll report on whether this will be a "long and happy marriage", or not.  But from what I know of drinking both instant coffees individually, I have no doubt it will be!  Stay tuned for the update! )

review/summary: First had this 20 years ago and still remember it vividly!
review/text: Yummy.  Texture is powdery so it mixes easily with water or milk.  More like matcha powder (green tea) or hot chocolate. Outstanding taste unlike any other unflavored coffee.  Brings back many memories of my time in the Peace Corps in 1991, sipping this coffee in Kingston or from the patio of a hostel on the highest peak in the Blue Mountains.

review/summary: Best Instant Coffee Ever!
review/text: When we went to Jamaica we purchased an instant coffee and it was sooo good.  Back in the states I ran out and went online to see if I could find it.  This doesn't have the same label, but it tastes exactly the same.  It is delicious!  Smooth and kind of almost chocolately tasting.  I love it.  Going to order some more soon as I'm almost out again!  I highly recommend!

review/summary: Sounds better than tasted
review/text: I love Jamaican Coffee It is up to 80.00 a pound here, so I thought an instant would be a great way of tasting it without having to shell out oodles of money. Instant coffee never taste as good as the brewed, but this is really really Weak.It must be cut with something. It doesn't taste real.

review/summary: Good but overpriced
review/text: This is very good dulce de leche: it is very close to the standard flavor you find in Argentina, but richer and less saturated than mass market brands. I don't think anyone could be disappointed with it.<br /><br />However, the price is ridiculous, even considering the cost of importing and shipping. It can be found even in the US for $6 in the right neighborhoods.

review/summary: How much caffeine?
review/text: Buyer beware.  Notice how carefully worded the descriptions are to avoid stating the caffeine content.  Many other sites still quote Perky Jerky's original advertizing claim that Perky Jerky contains 150mg of caffeine (from guarana).  Before you buy you should know that, due to federal Food Safety and Inspection Service intervention, Perky Jerky no longer contains anything close to 150 mg of caffeine.  U.S.D.A. officials explained that the Food Safety and Inspection Service "would not allow producers of beef jerky to add sufficient quantities of guarana to produce a stimulant effect." You can read the original source published in the New York Times:  [...]<br />Notice that the company now refuses to state how much caffeine their product contains.  The description says: "Perky Jerky, the caffeinated beef jerky is an all-natural, great tasting snack with a kick: an energy-drink's worth of invigorating caffeine in each serving."  But some "energy" drinks contain very little caffeine.  This new and intentional vagueness about their main claim does not bode well.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Expensive?
review/text: I buy this product in central Nebraska for 3.99 for a 2.2 oz. bag so seeing that I can now buy it in "bulk" for more seems kinda weird! it comes out to quite a bit more unless you are really in love with having things delivered to your door! Great product tho! I get it all the time locally!.

review/summary: Moist and delicious
review/text: I don't know about the energy burst that it is supposed to give you, but it was arguably some of the best jerky that I have ever had. It is moist and very flavorful, well worth the price.
