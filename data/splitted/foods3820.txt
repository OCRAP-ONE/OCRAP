review/summary: A lower calorie alternative to standard chips: 120 calories/oz. A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored
review/text: The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of "there must be something better".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per "serving"), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word "puff" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed "all natural". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them.

review/text: These chips are good. Knowing that they're not as bad for you will make you eat more of them - very dangerous.

review/text: I bought a multi-box of flavors but this was the absolute best flavor (IMHO) in there so it's the one I'll comment on.  Spicy, sweet, flavorful, fun, crispy, lower fat than chips, I loved it.  I'll be buying more but only of this flavor.  The other flavors weren't so great (salt & pepper and cheddar aren't too bad) but this one rocked.

review/summary: Great Chips Less Fat
review/text: I eat chips almost every day and decided I wanted to find something that tastes as good but is lighter on unnecessary fat than regular types of chips. I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of "regular" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor.

review/summary: Best "healthy" salt and vinegar chip out there
review/text: I am always on the hunt for a good lower fat salt and vinegar chip and I have to say, it is a very hard thing to find! I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip...to my disappointment, they said no. For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small brands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far. I would recommend it.<br /><br />Yes, I know, I appear to be obsessed with S&V chips...it is a little scary.

review/text: I love these salt and pepper flavored Popchips.  The bag size is perfect for a snack.  I love them in the afternoon when I get home from work, or at lunch with a sandwich.  Of course since they are "salt and pepper", there's a lot of salt.  I have to watch my sodium intake and it limits the number of bags I can eat.  Also, I would like to see the salt and pepper flavor included in the variety box instead of the vinegar, which I don't like at all.  Tastes too strong of vinegar.  Would be great for someone who absolutely loves vinegar.  It would also be nice if you could create your own variety box with the flavors you most prefer.  It does get a little boring eating 24 bags the same flavor.

review/summary: "Un-sinfully" Lip Smackin' Good
review/text: Love these pop-chips.  I've tried some other flavors too but found salt and pepper the best so far.  Original comes a close second for me.  Salt and vinegar is a very close third. Garlic is too strong for me (I love garlic in other forms though).<br /><br />I was hesitant to try these initially because I'm not a big fan of pepper flavor in chips, but am I glad I did!  The pepper flavor rounds up the chip rather than defines it, so it doesn't feel like you're eating pepper in it's raw form.<br /><br />It's a good thing the fat content is low because these are quite addictive.

review/summary: I wanted to love these...
review/text: I originally bought these chips because I'd heard great things about the company and their customer service, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the taste of the product.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- lower-calorie, baked-not-fried: this is definitely a huge plus!<br /><br />Con:<br />- I was expecting something more potato-ey. Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying "chip" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers. If you're looking for something with potato flavor as well as salt and vinegar, you might want to look elsewhere.

review/text: These chips are excellent! They stopped carrying them at my local Costco, but I was so happy to find them here!<br /><br />I guess they ran out of the plain kind because it said they were available when I ordered them... they are listed on my order sheet and Amazon invoice as "Original"... and lo and behold, I received "Sea Salt and Vinegar", not "Original".<br /><br />Still a good product, but wish I had a courtesy e-mail or something to tell me they ran out of "Original". I'm not a huge fan of salt/vinegar chips, but at least it keeps me from eating them quickly (it lets me nibble).

The one-ounce bags are perfect for a snack, but the 3.25 ounce bags end up being cheaper so I divide it up into 3 ziplock bags once I open them.  It works great!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I was really hoping to get a really great nutritious & delicious snack for my family when I ordered this product.  I was really disappointed.<br /><br />The packaging is really good looking and I had high hopes, so when I opened the package to my chips, I expected something great.  I ordered the Chili Lime flavor and, since, I have had higher-fat chili lime chips in the past, I'd knew that I would love them.<br />First, they don't really look like what they appear to be on the packaging (no big deal though).<br />I took a bite out of the first chip and it had a really funny texture and strange flavor.  So, I looked on the back where it showed the ingredients and I was pretty surprised--it had a LOT of chemicals in the product.  Also, AND THIS REALLY FREAKED ME OUT, the main ingredient is not a sliced potato, but, "potato ingredients (potato flakes, potato starch)".  In other words, it's made of instant mashed potatoes!<br /><br />I thought the taste was funny and the ingredients curious.  However, there are no transfats or saturated fats in the chips (that's why I gave it 2-stars).<br /><br />All in all, I would rather pack my kids lunches with a bag of Lay's or Kettle chips than give them these chips.<br /><br />All The Best.

If you have ever eaten "Funyuns" the onion flavored rings made by Frito Lay you have already tasted pretty much what Popchips taste like, just without the onion flavoring.  If your not concerned with calories, but simply want the best potato chip you can buy, try "Grandma Utz" potato chips, a true potato chip.

review/text: Not greasy or salty like a traditional chip, these actually tend to be more satiating as a sweet snack than a salty one, at least in the sweet potato chip variety. A handful of these is a sufficient pick me up and relatively wholesome, with just around 100 calories. The sugars are low too so even though you feel like you are having something slightly sweet it's really not going to spike your sugars (I think around 3g per serving). Overall these are a great little snack that you can feel good about eating.

They're tasty and filling, but relatively low in calories compared to traditional chips.

review/summary: Best Popcorn-type Chips of 6 Brands I Bought & Tested!
review/text: I wanted to have "sized" portions of chip-type product that would be tasty and filling.  I tried at least 6 different brands of popcorn-type snack packages (unfortunately, most came in 24-36 item packages).  After receiving the first 5 brands, I felt they were total waste of money.... 2 had texture of light styrofoam peanuts, with almost no flavor.  A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.  PopCorners White Cheddar brand came in SECOND.  Nice crunchy texture and pleasant cheddar flavor

review/text: These sweet potatoe chips were tasty with my only real objection being Maltodextrin which is hardly the "all natural nothing fake of phony" as advertized.  Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear "all natural no fake flavors" - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced -highly processed, sweetner from starch and a source of carbs.<br /><br />So aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine  I just wish they wouldn't try and pretend to be something they are not - they are  snack food - we expect some downside

review/summary: Pop Chips Barbeque Potato Chips
review/text: My local store was running a special on these, so I decided to give them a try.  They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation "spices" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Tastes Like Celery
review/text: I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds.

review/summary: Best chips EVER
review/text: So my cafe at work switch to a bunch of chips I don't like and some Popchips.  Then they added these sweet potato chips and they're the only ones I buy now.  The sad thing is that these are hard to find at stores.  You'll find plenty of the other Popchip flavors, but not the sweet potato.  So I broke down and bought a box.  I went with the 3-ounce version because the price per oz was lower than the smaller bags.  These bags aren't TOO big, and I just use a clip on them to keep the air out after they're opened.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I love Popchips. They are a lot different than regular potato chips, but they are quite good. Sea Salt and Vinegar and Chili Lime are my two favorite flavors, and I'd like to try Parmesan Garlic one day (they don't seem to be sold in my area for some reason). Popchips are lower in calories and fat than most regular potato chips, which makes them a healthier alternative when you're looking for something crunchy to snack on. I like to take them to movies (in those rare theatres that don't have 'no outside food' signs) to eat in lieu of butter-laden popcorn. If you're on the fence about buying these, I would recommend trying a small bag to see if you like them before buying one of these big multi-pack deals. I've seen them at a lot of grocery stores--that's where I buy mine. They really are quite different from regular potato chips, but they're tasty and definitely worth trying.

review/summary: Not exactly like traditional potato chips, but a great substitute
review/text: One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips.  I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next.

review/summary: Fantastic chips!!!
review/text: I want to start out by saying that i thought at first that a bag with only 120 calories and 4 grams of fat (no saturated or trans) for every 20 chips was going to taste like crap. I must say that not only was i wrong, that this is my favorite BBQ chip on the market today. They are light and you cannot taste any fat or grease after eating them. That's because they aren't baked or fried, just popped as their name suggests. These chips are very easy to dip as well. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!

review/summary: Holy SALT, Batman!
review/text: We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a "healthier" alternative to regular chips.  I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their "original" flavor...I can't imagine what the "Salt & Pepper" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a "healthy" alternative to chips.

review/summary: Sweet Potato Popchip Goodness!
review/text: As a kid, I scarfed bags of the Calbee Sweet Potato chips that my mom would pick up at the local Asian market. As my tastes refined in adulthood, I was less inclined to buy bags of those chips that resembled styrofoam even if I still craved their sugary sweet and salty flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips Sweet Potato chips are the adult version of the snack I grew up with. There's a delicious sweet and salty mix in every bite.  The chip is light and airy, without resembling a foamy rice cake and the deep orange hue is the color of a perfectly roasted sweet potato.<br /><br />I've purchased a number of sweet potato chips from Amazon in the past (Both the "Terra" & "Food Should Taste Good" chips) which have all been good, but they didn't play up the sweet and salty combo quite as much as I'd like. The Terra chips are more like simple sliced sweet potatoes, oven dried and turned into chips; the Food Should Taste Good chips are like yummy, sweet potato flavored, salty tortilla chips; and these Pop Chips sweet potato chips are, well... sweet potato pop chips.  If you've never had a pop chip before, the weight of an individual chip probably most resembles Baked Lays - but with a puckered, air-puffed texture.<br /><br />There are 100 calories per bag.  24 bags come nicely packed in a box that you can tear open for a neat display in your pantry.  I've purchased bagged chips online a number of times and have received packages where the chips were thrown into a box which was thrown into an Amazon box for shipping so by the time they got to me, all the chips were broken.  Not so with this packaging, they're tightly packed so the the bags don't shift around much in shipping and the few bags we've already eaten have had no more broken chips than what we'd get from picking up a bag in the store.<br /><br />Happy snacking!

review/text: We love the plain PopChips (seasoned with salt only).  These salt & pepper chips are very spicy, so you only want to buy these if you REALLY like that black pepper burn.  Also, there IS enough GLUTEN in the product to cause a reaction IF YOU ARE "ALLERGIC" TO GLUTEN.  I found that eating them once in a while was not a big deal, but eating them frequently truly was/is a problem for me.  They taste GOOD, but be careful if you have food allergies.  Just sayin'...

review/summary: Salt and Vinegar addict
review/text: I'm not particularly health conscious, but when the general store on campus only had salt and vinegar (my favorite chip flavor) in the popchips brand, I figured I'd give these a try. To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. The texture, which is between a chip and a rice cake, is a bit thicker than usual but has a very satisfying crunch. It also helps the chips to keep from crumbling too easily. The sea salt and vinegar flavor is the perfect combination of salty and tangy, and while these are quite filling, I don't fill sick after I binge on a whole bag the way I would with ordinary chips. I never liked baked chips much (the texture was just off for me) but I think I might actually prefer these to ordinary potato chips.

review/text: (Three times I've tried to post a review of these and it never goes through... forgive my abruptness.)<br /><br />Popchips? As in, potato chips puffed like popcorn? You got it, bub. Surprising lightness to them--much more so than expected, which allows the taste of the toppings (in this case, chili lime) to seem supercharged. This can be a good thing or not, depending on how sensitive your tongue is. Also, the texture is passing strange at first. Takes a bit of getting used to, but once you're used to it, you'll be popping these like, well, popcorn.

They're made with sweet potatoes so it makes sense.  Another interesting Popchips feature is that they are "popped"(hence the name, again, makes sense) rather than fried or baked... gives it an oriental rice snack kind of consistency.  All in all very pleased with these, give them a try for yourself, whether a health nut or not(a .8 oz bag of these is about 1/3rd the fat and half the rest of the nutrition facts numbers of a full oz of Lays for the record).

There's only 100 calories per bag and you actually get enough to feel satisfied.  We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.  They would make great crunchy toppings in recipes as opposed to breadcrumbs though I haven't tried anything beyond slipping a few onto my turkey sandwiches.  (Right, like you've never done it.)

review/summary: so disappointing
review/text: I love sweet potato and especially sweet potato chips. When I tried the original popchips, I was surprised by how good the taste and texture was, so I bought this in bulk, thinking it would be excellent because of the company and because I love sweet potatoes of course.<br />I was wrong.<br /><br />For some reason, the sweet potato chip they've created tastes like cardboard despite having the same texture (cross between rice cake and chip), added with a dash of salt. That's it. I can't describe it any other way than a "bland blah taste with salt"<br /><br />I wish I had gotten the parmesean garlic or the original instead.

review/summary: Jalapeno Pop Chips a No No
review/text: I love Pop chips- have tried many flavors and enjoyed them due to the low calorie count and they satisfy my craving for salt! With that said, I was so excited when I heard Pop Chips had come out with a Jalapeno Chip!<br />I am sad to say the Jalapeno chip just misses the mark. Both my husband and I agreed there is something off about them and seeing as we usually love other kinds of jalapeno chips, these were just not good. Save your money, don't get the jalapeno chips flavor.

review/text: Great taste with no saturated or trans fat.  A little high priced though, but well worth it for controlling cholesterol.
