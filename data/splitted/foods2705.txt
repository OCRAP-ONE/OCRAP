review/summary: tasty granola bar
review/text: Kellogg's Special K Dark Chocolate granola bars are tasty, however they are pretty generic. Nothing really stood out and wowed me, however they do taste good in my opinion. The dark chocolate is probably the best part of it. When I first bit into it, it reminded me of a rice krispie treat with chocolate. Instead of rice cereal though, it is made with oats. The box comes with 5 bars so with the price on Amazon, it costs about 75 cents a bar. Each bar contains 110 calories, 4 grams of fiber, 4 grams of protein, 3 grams of total fat, 85 mg of sodium, and 7 grams of sugar. They are pretty sweet so if you aren't a big sweets fan you probably won't like these. It's almost as sweet as a candy bar in my opinion, so it would be a healthier choice if given the option between the two.<br /><br />Overall, they are decent. I'd buy them myself if they were on sale at the grocery store.

review/summary: Sweet, but not real chocolat-y
review/text: I love granola bars, and I have often used them to satisfy a sweet craving to keep me away from something like a candy bar (even small ones).  This bar certainly looks great with a chocolate coated bottom, and some drizzled on the top.  Its on the small side, but that is happening more and more as we see more bars that are fewer calories and such.  This is a nice mix of protein and fiber, although, typically I personally either want a lot of fiber, or a lot of protein.  You will need to figure out if the mix of nutrients meets your needs.  I still seemed to be hungry after eating the bar.<br /><br />As far as taste, it has a sweet taste - I'm not sure how to describe it - maybe honey-like, but chocolate did not stand out, maybe because this was "dark chocolate".  I marked it down one star because even being dark chocolate, it just didn't even stand out at all.<br /><br />I recommend this bar as a light snack if you need something sweet, a little fiber, a little protein, and you aren't a big chocolate lover.

review/text: These bars are cereal with dark chocolate and contain 110 calories with 4 gram of fiber and 4 grams of protein.  They aren't especially tasty, but would be good to have on hand for a quick low calorie snack.  They do contain peanut ingredients and may contain tree nuts which may effect people with allergies.

review/summary: Oats and Chocolate but Nothing Special
review/text: The dark chocolate is perhaps the best thing about this granola bar, which otherwise seems rather generic - chewy but a little bland in flavor.  It's basically oats and chocolate - nothing fancy, and fine for a quick snack on the go, but it's not about to set the cereal bar world on fire.

review/text: These are the typical soft chewy granola bar that seems to be popular these days.  They are extremely sweet, the bars are small, and the dark chocolate flavor seems a bit, ummmm, manufactured is the best word I can come up with.<br /><br />On the plus side, they're about 3 grams of fat and 110 calories, so they're not a terrible snack.

review/summary: Slightly healthier than a candy bar, tastes like butt
review/text: The first thing I noticed when biting into this was an overwhelming soy taste, and the experience really didn't improve from there. This is just another of a long line of products that tries to promote itself as being a healthy snack, when really the only thing it has going for it is fiber. 4g of protein is rather insignificant, and it comes with a fair amount of sugar and a long list of ingredients that are far from natural. My twelve year old inexplicably loved them though, so your experience may be different.

review/summary: Great for Breakfast or a Quick Snack
review/text: The Special K Dark Chocolate Granola Bars are a delicious little pick-me-up. I have a notorious inability to fix breakfast in the morning. I love that I could eat a bar on the commute and that they tasted so good that I wanted to eat one. Each box of 5 bars is enough for a week's worth of breakfasts. Very convenient.<br /><br />After a week of Special K bars for breakfast (in addition to my required cup of coffee), I can say I felt much better during the day and was not ravenous by the end of my shift. The bars can also make a good lunch if you have a busy schedule.<br /><br />The chocolate flavor is authentic. I have tried a number of chocolate granola products, and usually the chocolate has a chalky taste. Special K bars are great in that they have a smooth chocolate flavor.<br /><br />The box lists each bar as:<br />Calories 110<br />Total Fat 3g<br />*Saturated Fat 1.5g<br />*Monounsaturated Fat 0.5g<br />Sodium 85mg<br />Total Carbohydrate 17g<br />*Fiber 4g<br />*Sugars 7g<br />Protein 4g<br /><br />Calcium 2%<br />Thiamin 10%<br />Niacin 10%<br />Iron 4%<br />Riboflavin 8%<br />Vitamin B6 10%<br /><br />**Contains Soy, Wheat, Milk, Almond, and Peanut ingredients.

review/summary: Better Than Expected
review/text: I didn't come into something called "Special K Granola" presuming I would like them as much as I do. However, there is enough chocolate to help something which is supposed to be good for me taste good.<br /><br />Crunchy, chewy, but not sticky. There is a linger vitaminy undertone. Granola and other such companies will receive higher marks from me when they sort this out.<br /><br />They go well with a French vanilla-flavored coffee I'm drinking.<br /><br />That famous beer slogan, "Taste great, less filling" almost applies. I ate the box of five in one sitting and don't feel stuff, but I do feel satisfied.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/text: These were possibly the best granola bars I've ever tasted.  They are not dry, nor too hard, and they are not tasteless.  (We all know the dark chocolate helped.)  There are lots of additives, and it's not as natural as I'd have liked, but it's Kellogg's Special K, and it should be good for you, and that's not a turn-off in this case.  Enjoy!

Dark chocolate lovers will definitely dig these bars.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they are small bars.  It would be nice to have them be around 1.5 or 2 ounces.  But as is, they're a great snack, and one that I've already bought more of.

review/summary: Good but very small.
review/text: As with everything the past few years, these continue to get smaller.  Each bar is less than an ounce, "0.95 ounces" and to compare, one cherry tomato weighs an ounce average. (I remember when these types of bars first came out and they were six ounces each.)  Although the emphasis on the box is "granola" the ingredients list starts with "soluble corn fiber, rolled oats, isolated soy protein, sugar" and then some "cereal" described as "rice, whole grain wheat, sugar, wheat bran, soluble wheat fiber, salt, malt flavoring...).  Sugar, salt, and flavoring included as 'cereal?'  They do contain "hydrogenated and/or partially hydrogenated" vegetable oils.  Of the total 110 calories, 25 are from fat (7 grams of fat half of which is saturated fat...).  They have 17 grams of carbohydrates including 7 grams of sugar.  I found them to be quite sweet for a granola product.  The box photo shows what appears to be peanuts but I didn't find many peanuts in any of the five bars.  They do have a few mini chocolate chips on the top with a thin chocolate layer on bottom.  Nice idea but again, in my opinion, another marketing ploy on the public.  These things are not very healthy... an apple would provide as much or more nutritional boost for a snack and be much healthier.  There's no hint what the price is/will be, but these are not something I will be purchasing.  I'll head for the produce department instead.... and get more for my $$$.

review/text: It's a darker color, from the dark chocolate, than some other energy bars, and the peanut pieces, rather than looking like whole half nuts as shown in the back of box photo, look more like chopped from a blender.  It is pleasantly chewy and the flavor is a mix of chocolate and peanuts.  It's actually reasonably good and with only 110 calories serves the purpose of quick, low calorie energy.

review/text: These have everything you look for in a snack bar:  tasty, chewy, gone-in-a-few-bites, and moist enough to manage without a drink.  The chocolate doesn't overpower the granola, instead just adding a nice sweet finish to that wholesome granola taste.  I think I'll be using these every once in a while to switch out for yogurt in my work lunch pack.

review/text: I'm a big coffee drinker but had had enough coffee for the day when my wife and I went out to dinner with friends last night.  My wife orders tea fairly frequently when we go out.  I selected the only bag of Bigelow Vanilla Chai Tea and prepared my tea as my wife was helping my son choose his dinner.  I enjoyed the aroma right away and suggested my wife try it.  She enjoyed it enough that she asked the waiter to bring another bag of this selection for her to use.  It is not very spicey, which the other reviewer apparently did not like about it.  I don't believe I would have enjoyed it if it was very spicey as I was looking for something that was mellow and relaxing.  We both enjoyed it enough that I went online to buy some.

It's weird and strong.<br />It almost seems as if they use too much vanilla or they have some weird substitute flavoring in those teas.<br />I really like their Earl Grey tea-if you're into that.  But Stash makes that tea better.<br />I hope this helps.

review/summary: Wonderful tea! But Amazon's price is now higher than the local store
review/text: This tea is wonderful, a good blend of vanilla and spices, and a good amount of tea as well.<br /><br />However, with Amazon's recent price hike, changing the subscribe and save discount to only 5% (was 15%), this tea is now cheaper at Wal-mart.  I can buy a single box at Wal-mart for $2.34 (including the sales tax, list price only $2.18), and this six-box set at Amazon now costs $2.42 per box (without sales tax).<br /><br />The tea I would give a 5-star, but downrating to four because it can be bought elsewhere for less.  Shame on Amazon!  The bulk rate for six boxes should be competitively priced, at or below what it costs at local stores.<br /><br />Addendum:  Amazon must really want to get out of the retail tea business. Now a few days later, after I even submitted the "tell us about a lower price" form, informing them of the lower price available elsewhere, Amazon instead RAISED the price of this tea even higher.  Strange indeed.

I still like the Tazo, but for some odd reason it has started to give me heartburn on occasion, so I found this Bigelow tea at Target and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Wow!  Yummers is all I have to say!  It is quite similar to the chai latte I get at Panera when I heat the water with a bit of milk, steep, and then add some agave sweetener.<br /><br />An excellent tea...wish there weren't any artificial flavors in it though(the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars).

It's got a lovely aroma of spices- I showed it to my family and we agreed it smells like a Pier 1 scented candle or something. It's aromatic and so delicious. It's a little sweeter than reg. chai and has that irresistable vanilla undertone. I like to brew it a little longer and add a little splenda and a shot of cream. So good! I'll be getting this again.

review/text: I was reluctant to try any chai teas after my initial experience with weird & medicinal flavored spiced teas labeled "chai."  This is really good.  Some of the reviewers said the vanilla flavoring was weird or strong, I think it's just right.  I love this tea and everyone that I've served it to has also enjoyed it.  Half of the tea I buy ends up going home with someone else!  It makes a lovely "chai latte" or just served as chai.  We drink it sweetened and heavily laced with milk, and it takes a strong flavored tea or it would be lost in the milk/sugar combination.  This tea makes the cut.  I definitely highly recommend it!

review/summary: Amazing chai
review/text: Bigelow Vanilla Chai Tea is definitely my favorite chai. If you make a cup as directed with three parts water to one part milk, or even go as far as one part water to three parts milk if you really like it richer, and just add a little sugar (you don't need as much sugar as with other teas, because of the vanilla flavor), you end up with something so good that it tastes like a chai latte from a cafe. The flavor is rich and warm and the vanilla really comes through in the flavor and adds an extra dimension that lends even better if you take your chai with milk. It is not very spicy though (in terms of "hot" spicy) - it doesn't give you that slight kick at the backend of the flavor, like the one you would get with a Starbucks chai latte or with the Tazo chai, so if you like your chai with more zing I suppose you could add your own extra ginger or peppercorns.<br />I cannot find this tea in any stores near me, especially for the price that Amazon has, but the shipping is so slow! They are not shipping until a week after I placed my order, even though it's in stock! I went to Starbucks yesterday for a chai latte, to hold me over until the Bigelow comes, but I was disappointed. Can't wait for the vanilla chai to come!

Found it on Amazon at a good price and have been ordering it every since.  I drink it every morning w/a little sweetner and/or flavored coffee creamer.  Tastes just like what you get at the pricey coffee shops.

review/text: I have tried many different brands of chai tea.  This is my absolute favourite.  I have 2-3 cups per day and I have been for a couple of years now.  Everyone who tries it loves it.  I'm spreading the addiction and my order is thus becoming larger and larger to accommodate my friends and family.  What can I say?  It's the best!

review/summary: Best Tea Ever!
review/text: I tried this and now I rarely drink coffee anymore.  I drink it with milk and no sweetener.  It is creamy and satisfying without too much caffeine.  I order it in bulk online at Amazon so I never run out.  I take it to work and keep a few in my purse for those restaurants that don't carry flavored teas.  My favorite Brunch restaurant has it in their tea cart and when they run out, I make them go in the back for more.  I am a real fan of this tea!

review/summary: Favorite Bigelow Tea
review/text: This Vanilla Chai is what I crave when it gets cold outside.  It smells absolutely delicious and the vanilla scent wafts through my room, which is more effective/safe/cheap than burning scented candles.  It helps me calm down and avoid reaching for candy when I'm studying at 1 AM. The tea itself isn't very spicy, but just incredibly vanilla-y. I don't add anything to it, but I'm sure a little milk and sugar would make it divine.

review/summary: My Secret to Surving Winter!
review/text: I live in Atlanta and while most don't think of the winter here as harsh, I was born over 500 miles south so its practically the arctic to me. Since moving here I have used hot tea as a winter comfort. For years I drank <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5GI">Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> which was strong and had lots of flavor but left a slight metallic aftertaste. I stumbled on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F952">Twinings English Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and for awhile, this strong tea with less of a metallic aftertaste was my favorite. But my wife brought home this Vanilla Chai tea and I think I have found my all time favorite. It is a traditional back tea with vanilla and other spices that added together are out of this world. I perfer it to the herbal teas I have tried because it has that underlying true black tea taste. I drink it with half and half, it has so much flavor it doesn't need sweetening although traditional chai teas are served very sweet. Try this tea and see what you have been missing!

review/summary: The best tasting 'prepared' Chai tea I've found!
review/text: To be honest, I don't think there's a 'prepared' chai tea on the market that comes anywhere close to the real thing; the BEST chai I've ever had was made for me by an Indian friend from scratch with real whole spices. They're 2 completely different animals if you ask me.<br /><br />I've tried several different prepared chai teas over the years and have been *severely* disappointed with each and every one of them! 'Artificial' and 'off-putting' are the terms that come to mind.<br /><br />While Bigelow's Vanilla Chai still does not compare to the real thing, if you like vanilla and spices, it's definitely worth trying! Love the aroma and flavour of this tea! Will most definitely be purchasing it again!

review/summary: Chai Yummyness!
review/text: I had tried Chai at a shop somewhere and really liked it so when I went shopping I found this brand and decided to try it. I LOVE IT!<br /><br />It isn't as 'easy' to make as regular tea. You have to boil the milk, water, and tea bags together. I serve it with some honey or sugar. It is great any time of year, I'll drink it hot in the summer.<br /><br />I have yet to try the cold version of it, but I want to. Perhaps when the spring comes around.<br /><br />I have not tried any other kind of Chai Tea so I do not have anything to compair it to, however, it is good enough to drink often. I actually drink this more than regular herb tea. I will make this more often than coffee. Very good.

review/summary: Stop buying $3 energy drinks; stock up on SToK and XLR8!
review/text: Pronounced "Stoke," these shots each pack 40mg of caffeine (the equivalent of an espresso shot). I keep a box in my office. I pour a shot into my cup and top it with French press coffee. What is great is that Stok adds a kick without altering my coffee's natural flavor.<br /><br />The box recommends children under 18 avoid use and that no one drinks more than two shots per day. The leading energy drinks are selling for $2-$4 at convenience stores, so purchasing just one a day sets you back $60 per month or $720 per year.<br /><br />Stok can save you a lot of money. How much? Well, the company recommends that you use no more than two containers (80mg of total caffeine) each day. Two containers cost about $0.15 total, which means you can drink Stok for 3-4 weeks for the same price as a single can of an energy drink.<br /><br />My recommendation is that you pour the shot into your cup first and follow it up with the coffee, either hot or iced. I don't recommend drinking Stok by itself but some of my co-workers tried it, but never twice.<br /><br />I notice the biggest difference in the afternoon. I'm more alert during the last three hours of work and all the way home. Rating: five stars.

review/summary: Short!
review/text: I like these, I initially found them on a rare trip to walmart, but like most things, they stopped carrying them.  As much as I need caffeine to get through my average day, I bought a pile of these for car trips, they're pretty great for staying alert on the road.  I am happy that I can get these from Amazon, but my box contained 259 shots and not the 264 shots I ordered.  There is evidence that one exploded, but I'm sure the packers helped themselves to the others when they added the air packs to cushion the rest of the shots.  The Stok box was packed inside another box with the other item I purchased at the same time, none of the shots were broken upon delivery.<br /><br />Happy with the product, sort of disappointed in the repacking crew.

review/summary: Make Your Own Frappachino
review/text: My husband found these at a grocery store, and I used them occasionally for their intended purpose-to add more caffeine to coffee. However, my favorite way is to buy small bottles of chocolate milk and add a stok or two to it, and I have an instant coffee drink which is way less expensive than Frappuchinos (which can cost up to $3 per drink!). I can usually buy a bottle of chocolate milk for $1, plus if I want, I can add more Stoks (although not recommended), and it gives me a great pick me up! I have also added them to Carnation Instant Breakfast drinks so it is a breakfast and energy booster in one. Our grocery store stopped carrying Stok, and I was extremely sad about their loss. Great to see them on Amazon!

review/text: These are SOOO hard to find at a good price. You can add these to almost any drink, and get the caffeine you'd expect of a cup of coffee. I have not noticed any taste to these, but have never had one plain either. They are not intended to be a shot that you drink alone,  but to be added to a cup of coffee, a smoothie, hot cocoa, chocolate milk, literally any drink. They are the size of a coffee creamer cup. I freeze them and don't worry about the expiration date. They arrive perfect and all intact.

review/summary: Very Good item at great price
review/text: A co-worker took these to work and it added some extra oomph to the morning coffee routine. I could not find them locally and so went to Amazon. They don't have to be refrigerated and there is a 2 per day limit because of the caffeine content. A couple of times I got the shakes at first; but it worked great to wake me up fast and get my morning rollin'. They are NOT a substitute for coffee, so I don't recommend mixing two of these with milk or water by themselves; you won't get much flavor(I tried). Definitely not recommended if you are sensitive to caffeine as It can upset your stomach and an immediate bathroom break may be needed. I do not use these daily, but having on hand every now and then is worth the cost in comparison to how many you get. I would recommend to have but use in moderation.

I need the extra caffeine to help me stay awake.  When I found Stok on Amazon, I was happy and ordered a box of 264 single-serve packages.  I put one pkg. in my first cup of coffee each morning.  The extra caffeine does not seem to bother me or make me jittery.  The recommendation on the pkg. indicates that no more than 2 pkgs. to be consummend in a 24 hr time frame.

I not only get to enjoy a cup of coffee but I also get extra energy to help me get through the day. No funky after taste. It doesn't give me the shakes. I never go over the recommended limit of 2 a day though which is just fine with me. The price and packaging are also good. I would definitely buy this again.  The 264-count is perfect because I get to share it with my office mate. That is all.

review/summary: An extra boost to your coffee
review/text: I have been enjoying this product for quite some time via my local supermarket.  They have elected to discontinue the product.  When I am in a crunch for time, adding one or two of these guys helps me get my caffeine to a manageable level without having to drink as much coffee.  It is tasteless added to my coffee, which I drink black.<br /><br />This particular item comes as a case of loose items.  I saved my retail box, and just refill from the case.  Worked well.  I was glad to find this on line.  It arrived more quickly than stated.  Well done all around.

review/summary: need a boost, try Stok Coffee Shots
review/text: I love these Coffee Shots.  If I need a boost in the morning from a restless night of sleep, I use one.  If it's early afternoon and I'm sluggish, I open one and put it in my coffee and within a few minutes I can feel a bit refreshed, they work really fast.  But NEVER drink it by it self, it taste terrible, but when it's used in a cup of coffee, I barely notice a difference in taste.  I will continue to keep these on hand as I love the energy boost they give me and the cost is fabulous.  I have one in a while use two at a time...they recommend no more than 2 a day.

review/text: There is a limit of two per day advised and I can see why. I know people have different tolerances but I am a hefty 230 pounds. Morning and afternoon is a good amount for me. Good for a quick bump in the morning or afternoon if you are dragging a bit and really great prior to a workout.

review/text: I was going to the local 7-eleven shop and they would offer these as a condiment for your coffee. That meant I would have to buy a coffee to put it in.  So I thought, save some money, I normally make my own coffee...and checked to see if I can buy them.  I did and it has saved me a bundle. I have shared with my fellow workers and now we have almost enough to get another case.  Awesome product!

review/summary: Supurb idea, works great in tandem with beverages.
review/text: As A patron of generation X I refused to partake in the recent fad that is energy drinks. It seems that everywhere I look nowadays I see other 20 something year olds clinging to their Monster energy drinks and slim shiny cans of Red Bull. I never fell for the marketing ploy of energy sugar water but still need that pick me up for the daily grind. Since all night High School and College cram sessions I have become a Coffee Guru. Ive tried numerous brands, cool coffee makers and travel press mugs and can easily discuss coffee with anyone for hours at A time.<br /><br />During a recent drag a truck driver gifted me with a tiny Stok cup. I gulped it down shooter style and found it to taste like a mild albeit watered down cup of tepid black coffee. The taste of caffeine is prevelant but not overwhelming. Nothing enjoyable but not at all bitter or gross. Anyone familiar with espresso will be well akin with it. Within minutes I was wide eyed and bushytailed just as if I had drank a full cup of french roast. It was a mild alertness not overly caffinated jitters or quick ramp of energy like that of a 5 hour energy. Stok is litterly the efficiency of coffee in a no nonsense delivery. Of course I was impressed by this and immediately purchased this years supply from Amazon as it is quite hard to find elseware. I have been experimenting with different blends and found that it compliments Eight O Clocks House Blend quite well when mixed with half and half. Just helps to punctuate the taste and of course deliver some extra caffeine.<br /><br />The only detail I am confused about is why they suggest only two a day. Humans can safely consume 500mg of caffeine where these only pack a modest 40mg. In fact a mere 7oz of drip coffee contains over 100mg of caffeine. Regardless of that fact it still seems to do its job and I am more than happy sucking them down whil smirking at the Monster drinkers and their $4 Super Extreme Mega Special edition cans of putrid Sweet Tart tasting fiz juice.

review/summary: Surprisingly awesome gas-station coffee run
review/text: My experience with the product was during a trip out of state, finding them at a gas station where we went to grab stuff for our caffeine and snack fixes (I've since scoured my local establishments to no avail).<br /><br />When you use them in conjunction with coffee, the average cup of which is going to already put you to 100mg of caffeine per 8oz, two cups with these added in will already get you to 280mg of caffeine for the day.  That's just between 3 and 4 cans of 8oz Red Bull in terms of caffeine content.<br /><br />I just placed my order for a case (along with some single-serve creamers, to cover up terrible coffee when I travel or go to work), because while I enjoy coffee, I don't feel like sitting and drinking more than 1-3 cups in one day.<br /><br />I'd recommend this product to both folks trying to kick an expensive energy drink habit (these are less than a dime each at time of writing), and those that would love to get more caffeine during their day, but just don't want to stomach an entire pot of coffee to do so.  These won't change the flavor of what you're adding them to, so they are just an awesome little additive for those that want more caffeine from their daily cup. :)

review/summary: Stok black coffee (single serve) review -- excellent
review/text: We really enjoy being able to purchase the 264-count box of STok single serve coffee shots.  My husband loves them in the morning and can take them ANYWHERE; even work, where the coffee isn't always what he likes, so he can make his favorite with the handy Stok single serve packages. The only worry I had with the shipment is that they seem a little fragile without any padding or barrier around them.  If one got punctured the whole container would have coffee all over (just a thought to consider).  Otherwise, we are very pleased with the product and price.

review/text: I like coffee and I like caffeine.  My wife and I discovered these Stoks when we stopped at a convenience store for coffee.  Liked them so much that sometimes, we "helped ourselves" to a few extra Stokes to have in our freshly brewed coffee at home.  When I saw these advertised on Amazon, I had to have them.  Even keep a couple extra in our cars.  The caffeine in these Stokes is about the same as espresso.  It doesn't make me jittery and doesn't alter the flavor of the coffee.  Love this stuff!  Now I don't have to sneak a couple extra out the door at the convenience store.

review/text: They read my mind.  Having German ancestry, I was weened on coffee.  I'm from the "coffee that's too strong won't pour" school.  But when I give blood, they have only decaffeinated; go to evening meetings, same.  This is a solution for us caffeine lovers.  Keep a couple of dozen in the car for adding to weak gas station coffee or the decaffeinated brew offered when only one pot is available and some don't wish caffeine.  These run far cheaper than "energy drinks," too.  Oh, and forget the "Limit: 2 per day" notice unless you are really caffeine-sensitive (in which case you won't be interested in SToK anyway.)

I suggest them to anyone that likes the taste of coffee, and the boost of caffeine.

review/text: I like the quality and effectiveness of this product. It delivers extra caffeine with your coffee simply and quickly. Negatives of this product are that it changes the flavor of your coffee making it slightly more bitter. Just adding more sweetener to combat that problem solves the extra bitterness but also changes the flavor of your coffee. If one uses cheap coffee or drinks flavored coffee then that is not really a problem. I also disliked the fact that the price jumped by 15% between the time I first bought it and the time I reordered (aprox one week). I buy this product so I can bring it to work and give it to coworkers. At $20 per box that was acceptable. At $24 per box it is getting pricey. I doubt I will purchase this product again simply because the price.

Energy drinks range widely, but 200mg seems to be in the ballpark, so two of these in a cup of coffee is still less than that.<br /><br />For those of you that get something out of this, great, but it's not comparable to an energy drink, imho.

review/text: Very excited about product at first but after ordering I have noticed that some days I get an extra boost and others it does nothing for me.  Maybe I just got a bad batch but worth noting.  The idea is excellent but does no good if it does not work.
