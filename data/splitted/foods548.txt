review/summary: About the best Earl Grey Tea I've found
review/text: Since I first tasted Stash brand Earl Grey tea, I have not purchased any other brand of Earl Grey.  The other brands I've tried just don't taste as good and are not quite the same.  This tea is flavored with oil of bergamot, rather than just "scented" with it, as as some labels say on other brands of Earl Grey tea.  I'm not sure what the difference is, unless that maybe Stash just uses more of the bergamot in their recipe.  But whatever the difference is, it works!<br /><br />For an added treat, also try the Stash "double bergamot" Earl Grey tea.  I highly recommend both, and I regularly drink both.

review/summary: Bold but not harsh, excellent flavor
review/text: This is my favorite of the wide varieties of teas I have. It has a strong but not harsh, and definitely not a wimpy "herbal tea" excellent flavor for a cup of perfect hot tea.  In the summer I use 3 peach tea, 3 regular black or green tea bags in my ice tea maker for extremely refreshing great flavored ice tea.  Some other teas I have tried are a bit too sweet; not this.  I don't think you could be disappointed in this choice.

review/summary: great peach flavored black tea
review/text: As a previous reviewer stated,this tea is a wonderful balance of peach flavor and black tea.I am a traditional tea drinker and could never tolerate those 'fruitty' herbal teas as they are not really tea at all. But this Stash peach tea has a strong black tea base and just a hint of genuine peach flavor.In the summer I always brew 2 or 3 black and Darjeeling tea bags with one peach tea bag and the end result is superb iced tea.I highly recommend this product

review/summary: An enjoyable way to start the day
review/text: I drank the regular strength Stash Chai for more than a year, and I liked it very much, although I always found myself wishing for a spicier version. When I learned that Stash also makes a Double Spice Chai I picked up a box of it at a local coffee/tea shop and decided it was actually closer to my preferences. When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product. Nevertheless, I am still generally content with my Double Chai and am continuing to enjoy my morning brew of it.

review/text: the tea itself doesn't seem hearty enough to stand up to the spices. What I mean is that even after waiting the right amount of time for my cup to finish steeping, I have a cup of chai that's spicy but not really strong enough for me. I don't like stuff toxic; that's not the problem. I think perhaps this tea is just not meant to be very strong.<br /><br />It's got a great level of spiciness, however, and it smells wonderful as it's brewing.<br /><br />Stash Company--how about just a titch more black tea in each bag? :-)

review/summary: Very good orange spice tea.
review/text: I just tried orange spice tea for the first time on a recent trip to Hawaii, and they had a tea chest of varoius Stash teas in the lobby for people to try. So I deceded to try a flavor I had never had before and I was pleasantly surprised. Now orange spice tea will always remind me of Hawaii. I bought a box of Bigelow Constant Comment, which is another orange spice tea, but it wasn't as good as Stash's, im my opinion. Stash has much more flavor, and isn't that the point?

review/summary: Steeping - the longer the better
review/text: This tea is delicious with milk. The description on the website says to brew for 3-5 minutes. While this is a normal instruction for black tea, it will not produce the best chai. Because chai contains lots of spices, like other spicy things, it is better if the spices have the opportunity to mellow out. Basically, the longer you leave it, the better it gets. You can leave it over night or as long as you want. If it is cold, just put it in the microwave or reheat on the stove to bring it up to your preferred temperature.<br /><br />The decaf version with milk makes a lovely bedtime drink.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG8M6">Stash Decaf Chai Spice Tea, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Satisfying, Low Fat and Versatile; Dented Cans, Though
review/text: I enjoy the turkey SPAM, which has only a fraction of the fat of regular SPAM (Ham SPAM has 17 grams of fat, whereas the turkey variety has on 4.5 grams of fat).  I use it for a variety of meals in place of ham, and it works out fine for me (Macaroni and Cheese with Broccoli and turkey SPAM; in Salads, etc. -- just as good as the traditional dishes).<br /><br />Unfortunately, several cans were badly dented upon arrival, making them unsafe to eat, really. So the high price was not worth paying.  But as it was during the winter storm, "Blizzard-Geddon" of 2010 (78" snow total), I thank the Lord for having even the dented cans on hand! Yes, in everything give thanks!

review/summary: Turkey matter that you can gobble anytime!
review/text: There's something geniunely weird about turkey being called Shoulder of Pork and Ham.  Obviously, it's not that.<br /><br />So what to call this stuff?  Turkey Meat and Stuff?  TUMS?  Nope, that one's been taken. TWAM? Turkey Wing and Meat?  Who knows what turkey parts are in here?  I just assume that the really good turkeys are sold intact, with the innards removed, so there must be plenty of other parts we don't get to see, or turkeys that are not worth trying to sell intact, that goes into this lowest fat of all of the famous and legandary SPAM product.<br /><br />The good news is that it's way easier to slice than a real turkey, and you can cook it in a few minutes.  And yes, I really recommend slicing and browning this stuff in a frying pan.  Otherwise it does sort of resemble cat food.<br /><br />Personally, I'm experimenting with shifting my breakfast toward protein and away from fat and carbs so won't be tempted to eat a huge lunch in the middle of the day when my job is basically sitting and moving a mouse around.<br /><br />So, I gave this a try and if you fry it a bit it isn't bad.  It's sort of like going to Arby's without getting in the car.  Oh yeah, and if there's another economic downturn, it's a really cheap way to have a Thanksgiving dinner.  Better stock up now!

review/summary: 4 Star Taste, But Overall Not A Pleasing Product
review/text: I grew up in SE Alaska back in the 70's when the transportation infrastructure was not as good as it is today.  Sometimes, things like fresh meats, fruits, vegetables, and dairy were a bit expensive back then.  While fried Spam was not a staple back then for us, it was definitely a regular on the menu.<br /><br />Now in my mid 30s, I work a lot of late nights and was looking for something quick and easy to eat, yet actually has protein and is filling.  Walking down the grocery aisle, it jumped out at me, viola, Spam.<br /><br />While it no longer sports its key that you used to tear away that thin strip of metal, it was just as I remembered.  However, I no longer had the metabolism of a child.  I am already festively plump, so I figured I better lay off the blue Spam.<br /><br />So I decided to give the Turkey Spam a try.  At about half the calories and much less fat, how could I go wrong.<br /><br />What separates Spam from the cheap Wal-Mart knock off for me is that Spam has a nice firm texture which other imitation brands do not seem to have.  While I would give the taste of the Turkey Spam 4 stars, the texture was terrible.  The texture was soft and mushy, much like the imitation Spam products.  Personally, it reminded me of eating a can of cat food.  After eating a few slices, I could not bring myself to finish the can.  I did not try frying it.  Perhaps some further cooking would firm it up a bit.<br /><br />If you are a Spam addict and figure you need to shave some calories out of your diet, it is definitely worth a try.  The taste was not bad at all.  However, if the texture of your mystery meat products is important to you, I'd probably stick to Spam blue.

review/summary: Do not know WHAT I expected
review/text: Since my family loves Spam (fried for sandwiches) I thought I would try this product for a change of pace. Not sure, really, what I expected but was not sold on this at all. Did not have the taste of regular Spam but did not have the taste of roasted turkey either. Not sure what it tasted like. I proceeded to prepare it as I always do for sandwiches....heated up a non-stick skillet and sliced the product. Now I realize that this product is leaner than the regular Spam, and having said that I know now that I should have sprayed the skillet with a non-stick spray such as Pam. The product stuck to the pan like crazy and I was not able to fry it up evenly. This gave the procuct a mushy texture that was not pleasing. If you try it make sure you spray your pan first to avoid the sticking. Again, while eating it I was trying to figure out what it tasted like......still not sure. Had origianlly gotten this on subscribe and save but I thinkl I will cancel and just remain with the old standby..the original.

The texture of Turkey Spam lends itself better to being fried and eaten. It needs hardened up by frying because it's a little mushy otherwise. The kids like it.

He had already finished off almost all of it plain and on seasoned Triscuits!  We have used it on pizza; yes! Pizza!  It actually makes a great addition to a pizza with a white sauce base.  We toss it in salads, pasta, and rice dishes.  There are so many times that we just want a light snack and the addition of the Spam makes it like a mini meal.<br />The whole family loves it.  I had to upsize next month's order to make sure we don't run out too quickly.  :)<br />Just because it says Spam on the can doesn't mean it's mystery meat.  lol  Loving this stuff!

review/summary: Turkey Spam = Healthy Mystery Meat?
review/text: I have never tasted Spam until finding Turkey Spam.  It definitely tastes Turkey, but it is a great source of emergency food.  It tastes great making Spam Sushi.  Amazon has great prices for this item.

review/summary: As canned meats go - Not bad at all when fixed .....
review/text: in a grilled sandwich/Panini or not/ adding layer sharp cheddar cheese and barely a taste of Mayo [optional] Cracked black pepper [optional] sliced tomato etc........BUT tastier IF slices are pre-grilled b/4 putting into a sandwich or soup pot.<br /><br />NO Salt adds though as already has Nitrites in it - not as bad a many brands of Hot Dogs, but enuff to use caution if U tend to have a blood pressure problem.<br /><br />Precooked - so handy to have on hand if Power failures arise.<br />Does not have same overpowering taste nor grizzle chunks as Regular Spam.<br /><br />Slice thin - for all uses and pan fry also - in Maple syrup [optional] or dice into soups/ scrambled eggs or omlets.

review/summary: Tasty with OK nutrition when used carefully
review/text: I've been buying Spam products from Amazon over the past year. I tend to favor Spam Turkey, With Bacon, and With Cheese, so my commentary focuses on these three. Each of these three can be fairly tasty depending on the exact use. When Amazon's pricing dips below $15, then it beats pricing at my local supermarket. Above $15, and I start checking out my local sales.<br /><br />An obvious consideration with Pam is its nutritional value, or possible lack there of. So I looked up some of the relevant nutritional information, some of which I will repeat here. You should consider doing the same.<br /><br />Each can of Spam holds 12 ounces, or six servings (in Hormel's estimation). Each serving of Turkey Spam has 80 calories. The bacon and cheese versions have 180 and 170 calories, respectively.<br /><br />A serving of Turkey Spam has 4.5 grams of total fat and 1.5 grams of saturated fat. The numbers for Bacon Spam are 16 and 6 grams. And for Cheese Spam, the numbers are 15 and 6 grams. The recommended daily reference values are 65 and 20 grams.<br /><br />A serving of Turkey Spam has 35 mg of cholesterol while the others have 40 mg of cholesterol. The recommended daily value is 300 mg.<br /><br />A serving of Turkey Spam And Bacon Spam have 520 mg of sodium. Cheese Spam has 720 Mg. The recommended daily value is 2400 mg.<br /><br />Essentially this means that Turkey Spam is healthier than the others, but any of these versions of Spam can fit into a nutritious program SO LONG AS you limit the servings and don't use a lot of fatty oil if you fry your servings. If you insist on eating a whole can every day, you will tend to be fat with clogged arteries and high blood pressure.<br /><br />I don't fry my Spam although it's tempting to do that a slice at a time for breakfast. Instead, I tend to use Turkey Spam diced in pasta salads and sliced for sandwiches. The cheese and bacon versions have a more distinctive taste, and I use them mostly to add some meat to the Betty Crocker mashed potatoes that I also buy from Amazon.<br /><br />Of course, Spam IS very tasty and when fried is always a winner with kids. As long as they don't gorge themselves on it, it should be fine. In the end, the key with Spam as with many other foods is to be moderate and balanced in what you eat.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

review/summary: Turkey Spam Is Good For Your Storage Preps
review/text: I bought a few different varieties of Spam so we could store meat products for our storage preps. What I like about this product is that you do not need a can opener to open it. You can carry it in a backpack, put it in your vehicle or just grab it quickly if you have to leave your home for any reason. A good camping food too.<br /><br />We like it cut up and cubed and fried with potatoes or eggs. Good for making a turkey salad too. It really does taste good. I know so many people put Spam down but it is a product that is useful. Especially if you need meat that does not have to be refrigerated.<br /><br />This product I did purchase from Amazon even though it is not verified that I did. That is because I purchased it with my husband's account.

review/summary: Just don't eat it at room temperature
review/text: This product is great eaten two ways: cooked or refrigerated. Both of those choices give the product a nice, firm texture. It bugs me that so many folks are complaining that the texture is a little mushy at room temperature... That's true, sure, but it takes very little effort to substantially improve your experience. It's as if someone complained that a potato doesn't taste very good if you don't peel it or cook it before you eat it.<br /><br />Either cook it or refrigerate it and you'll be perfectly happy--seriously.

review/summary: Turkey Spam - Yummm!!
review/text: I am very, very impressed with this particular seller, Shopping Store.  They sent the Turkey Span amazingly quickly and efficiently.  I received it two days after I placed the order even though I specified Standard shipping.  I plan to purchase other products from Shopping Store in the future.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of turkey.  I will make an extra large turkey at Thanksgiving so I will have plenty of leftover turkey for later.  Turkey Span will be a reasonable substitute the rest of the year.  It will pair well with eggs, make good casseroles and decent sandwiches, just to name a few uses.  It also has a good turkey flavor.

This because it has a lot of flavor and a way too much salt.

review/summary: One of the best Sparkling ICE flavors (contains Splenda)
review/text: The Sparkling ICE brand is one of my favorite drink brands ever. I always thought I was craving sugar when I would reach for a soda instead of water (which wasn't often but often enough to make me hate myself for craving something so inherently unhealthy) but after realizing that it was the carbonation I was after, I quickly changed to these calorie free (and carb free, gluten free, and caffeine free) drinks instead. They are seriously so GOOD.<br /><br />And this lemonade flavor is by far my favorite. Many of the others are so strongly flavored (the pineapple one in particular) that you can't drink it with every type of meal (ie seafood, pasta, etc) which was annoying. This one though, I found I could. If I had to chose one drink that I had to drink for the rest of my life without ever having anything else, this would be a very close second behind water. It's THAT good.<br /><br />The only thing I would note is that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda doesn't bother me at all but my husband can instantly tell the difference and ends up with a stomach ache any time he consumes it so unfortunately these can't help me to get him off his soda kick. So if you are also sensitive to Splenda, this isn't the product for you.<br />Comment

review/summary: Drinkable Lemonade...
review/text: This lemonade flavor of Sparkling Ice was reasonably good. The lemon was not overly tart, but was a bit too sweet to suit me. On the down-side, this drink leaves a rather subtle -- yet distinct -- 'chemical' aftertaste. It's likely due to the added vitamins. I can't recommend this particular flavor, but I'd willingly accept it, if it were offered to me on a hot summer day.

review/summary: Good cinnamon for this price
review/text: The product description is a little sparse, so when I came back to re-order and saw there were still no reviews, I thought I would add some more information.<br /><br />First, as you probably guessed from the price, this is cinnamon burmanii, so it is not the most flavorful variety of cinnamon, and it is not really suitable for grinding.<br /><br />The product come in 3 individual sealed packages with a reusable zip-top seal, which is nice, because you don't need a container to store it in once it is opened.<br /><br />The main thing I use them in is to flavor coffee instead of sugar, and they work pretty decently for that.  For a normal, 6-oz cup of coffee, you only need a half of a stick.  They are pretty tough sticks though, I just switched to a 12-oz mug and I use a whole stick.<br /><br />They have a good cinnamon flavor, being more sweet than spicy, so if you are looking for spicier cinnamon you may way to keep looking.<br /><br />I experimented with steeping the cinnamon in the coffee before pouring it in the cup, but it seemed a little bitter when I did that.  You are better off putting it in right when you are ready to start drinking your hot beverage.

These also seem to have a different peppermint flavoring than most - very refreshing.

review/summary: 3 Stars for Poorly Represented in Picture- For Teacup Breeds!!
review/text: With two, 5 month old Golden Retriever puppies (and an 8 year old), I was looking for a bag of raw hides at a good price. I realize that the description states 2.5", however the picture makes the bones look like tightly knotted, "normal" sized bones - they are not. They are tiny, almost see-through and take up HALF the length of my palm, and are skinny. The pups devoured the entire bag in less then a week (they were given other treats as well.) I swear when I gave them the first one, they looked at me like "are you kidding??" Lesson learned. If you have a teacup breed, these are the bones for you (that is if teacup breeds even eat raw-hides)!!

Now I dip them in milk first and they love them.<br />I'm glad the small bones were not discontinued since they are beefhide and are easy to chew.

Very creamy, so smooth. I only wish the company would make different flavors, like peanut bars, puffed rice bits, and "chunky" bars with cranberries and pecans...

review/summary: Good-tasting product and improvement over candy
review/text: The clever name is instructive: conventional chocoLATE--"latte" refers to dairy-based.  So, for those trying to avoid dairy, this company uses rice milk. What is rice milk? Any grain can be made into a substitute milk by cooking the grain with at least 5x the amount of water, which will yield a milk-like substance after cooking.<br /><br />Also, it is sweetened with unrefined cane, which has some of the nutrients lost when refined into white sugar.  While not as optimal a sweetener as stevia or agave, it is less deleterious.<br /><br />In the end, this ricechoco has a taste very close to good chocolate, will not cause the mucuous-like symptoms that dairy-sensitive people experience, and will cause less of a "sugar-rush-then crash" when consuming conventional chocolate bars.<br /><br />a.

If you plan on doing any baking in the future, I would highly recommend always having some of this in stock - it stores very well in the fridge for long periods of time, and the results can't be beat, especially for the price!

review/summary: Be wary of what you're buying
review/text: My usual supplier was out of mini cones, and I came across these.  In order to save a few bucks we got the bulk case.  Shipping and "handling" charges were Twenty dollars.  That would have been perfectly acceptable if they had used the money to actually package these properly instead of just make extra money like some infomercial.  The case arrived - all the cones packed in a single plastic bag within 1 box.  This box was in a larger shipping box.  The entire top and bottom rows were cracked to the point of rendering them unusable.  Several along both sides were also damaged.  On top of all that, they have almost no flavor whatsoever, even by wafer cone standards.  If you are looking for good cones, look elsewhere. [...] will send you mini sugar cones that are much more worth it.

The packaging was more than adequate - not one cone was broken!  And the cones were substantial enough to stand up to warm melted chocolate without softening.  I will use this product at Christmas to make Christmas tree treats and would definitely recommend it.

review/summary: Bzzzzz...
review/text: I bought this tea because when summer rolls around, I am a little puddle of miserable. Seriously, my allergies attack with everything they've got and there are days where I simply cannot go outside. Last summer, I discovered green tea seemed to help with some of the symptoms, as did local honey. So when I spotted Bee Pollen Matcha, I had to try it, if only to keep on hand for when I make smoothies all summer. Mmmm smoothies. A little frozen fruit, a splash of tea, and I am in heaven. This is why I bought a blender!<br /><br />This is most likely a case of mind over matter, but the first few sips of this tasted like honey to me. I don't know if it actually does, it's not overwhelmingly sweet, but it tastes a touch like honey. Kind of like how Honeybee from DavidsTea tastes like...well, how you imagine a bee would taste. All bzzzz and the like. But it is sweet enough and flavorful enough that while I was drinking it at work, I kept reaching for it. I tend to place my travel mug on the corner of the desk and forget it's there until I lose my voice.<br /><br />This matcha is also a good addition to my smoothies, since it provides calcium and protein. As someone on a dairy-free diet, the ability to get calcium in my tea is very important to me. A friend of mine says that "drinking tea for the health benefits is like having sex for the exercise," but after a summer of allergies made manageable by local honey and green tea, I'm a believer. Do I think tea is going to magically make me skinner? No. Damn it. But I do firmly believe that teas like this matcha can help with things like allergies and vitamin deficiencies. If nothing else, this tea keeps me away from carbonated drinks like Coke and Dr. Pepper....mmm, Dr. Pepper. It also helps me cut back on sugary fruit juices and heart attack causing energy drinks. Matcha is all I need to get that rush to help me make it through my day. And this particular matcha is a tasty, tasty option. I love it! A sweet green tea that makes you feel like you're drinking something that will give you superpowers? That also helps you get your vitamins and bounce around your office like you just had a large can of Red Bull? Sign me up!

Needs no refrigeration until it is opened, and once you do open it, it lasts for a long time in the refrigerator. My issues were with the expiration date. Mine expired about 2 months after I received it. There was no way that I could use 12 32oz cartons of this in that time--the very reason I bought it was because the description stated "long shelf life." Luckily, Amazon remedied the situation.

review/summary: 2 Things
review/text: Two things I'd like to comment on...<br />First:<br />Reading the first reviewer's comment about the shelf life, I was concerned, but gambled on the purchase anyway.  While I did better than they did (they received their product with 2 months until it went beyond the code date), I only got 8 months.  Reading the description, it talks about being shelf stable for 13 months so I was robbed of the 5 months.<br /><br />Second:<br />I bought this primarily as cream for my coffee so I'm estimating that I'll use at most 2 Tablespoons per day (more on the weekend, but I generally only have two cups of coffee at home as I'm mostly drinking my daily coffee at work).  Each carton holds 64 Tablespoons.  So that means I'd use it up in 32 days.  However, each box is only good for 14 days once it's opened (although I'm guessing that's probably conservative).  With those numbers, I'll be throwing away half of each box.  Now I'm sure that I'll use the stuff in recipes here and there too, so my usage will increase somewhat but the long and short of it is that the boxes are just too darned big!  Come to think of it I can probably take some to work as I've got a small Tupperware container to carry it back and forth in, but still :(<br />Continuing with the math, if I use one box every two weeks, that means my supply of 12 boxes will be used up in just 24 weeks which puts my supply inside the 8 months shelf stable date this batch came with.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy, but BORDENS - PUSH TETRPAK (the packaging supplier) TO COME OUT WITH A CARTON THAT'S HALF THE CURRENT SIZE!!!!!!!!!!

If you buy regular half and half at the store, it lasts about that long anyway.  There's no way we will be able to use up a whole case of this stuff in two months.  I think it is unethical for Amazon to sell products at full price this close to their expiration date.  What a waste of money!  I'm also disappointed to see that Amazon reduced their Subscribe and Save discount to 5% from 15% - very quietly, I might add.  I have been a regular customer for a very, very long time, but not sure that I will continue to be...

review/text: As for the taste of the product, it tastes just like evaporated whole milk to me.  It does not have the creamy mouth-feel of regular half-n-half.  I know that this is from treating it for long term shelf life, but I would not invest the money in it when you can get evaporated milk on sale quite often and it has a much longer shelf life.<br /><br />I ordered 2 boxes of this and one box was leaking so bad that FedEx would not deliver it.  The other appeared fine but inside had leaked everywhere and it took forever for me to find one container that wasn't leaking to try the product. The box was packed pretty good, the flat of cartons were wrapped in bubble wrap but with a bit of empty space in the box; so it is a 50/50 chance the cartons are just leaky or damage happened during shipping from shifting around in empty space during transit.<br /><br />Either way, Amazon customer service was wonderful about fixing the problem, but I will not be reordering.

review/text: I saw these for the 1st time in Walmart and since I'm a "crafty" type person I visualized different things I could do with these and I ended up making the most adorable "snowmen" to give last Christmas with my cookie boxes.  They were a hit!  I've already started on this years project of making wreaths with them. Everything is edible and they keep very well in the freezer so I'm not in a last minute rush.  They also make great "s'mores!"  Like I said, they freeze really well, so I was able to purchase these in bulk at a really good price and be able to use all year.

review/summary: Tasty. Big. Why not ?
review/text: Good food for good price, although shipping cost to my country were big (8 pounds though).<br />Thought, they will be little, but they're BIG, like 2 inches.<br />If you eat it as usual - they taste like usual. If you put it in microwave - the taste changes dramatically.<br />Can't wait to try to fry them on fire - they're really big, not like usual mallows, so it will be great.

review/text: Come one now, who doesn't love huge roasted mellows over a camp fire. They arrived very fast and very fresh.
