review/text: This product ships fast so you don't spend a lot of time waiting to enjoy it.  And when it arrives, you are not disappointed.  It is sealed well and remains moist in it's own liquid.  The texture is smooth, silky and not too stiff.  This is a cheese you will truly enjoy.

review/text: They arrived very well packaged and they taste great! However they are not "Gems" as the packaging on Amazon shows. In fact my packages didn't have gems anywhere on it, and neither do they resemble the other products I have bought that were gems. All that means is they don't melt in your mouth the way gems do, but they are still excellent!

review/summary: Not crazy about it.
review/text: I actually really miss boxed dry frosting.  I really liked it.  This Jiffy frosting mix is the only dry boxed frosting I've been able to find.  I have to say that it tastes, to me, like a box of chemicals in chocolate.  But I made do with it.  It was definitely disappointing.  But what are going to do when you have 24 boxes.  It would have been too expensive to ship back, so we doctored it up and made it work for us.  I wish it tasted more like chocolate and less like it came from Love Canal.

The first time I made this, I followed the directions.  It turned out perfectly - very fluffy.  It was so easy.<br /><br />The flavor is mild.  I prefer a bit more spice, but the fragrance and flavor of fresh lemon is there.  There is a hint of garlic and spices, so for those who prefer a touch of flavor, this would be perfect.  The second time I made this, I added more garlic, a little onion, a pinch of cumin, and a few more spinach leaves.  Regardless, I will buy this product again!

review/summary: For Mixed Drinks Only
review/text: I've been a fan of the original Starbucks VIA Colombian since its release, and had been keeping a close eye on my local retailer for the flavored varieties to be released, which they have inexplicably stocked roughly two weeks before the release date.<br /><br />The notably larger and heavier packages are sold alongside the original VIAs, featuring only six servings per pack. VIA fans will note the "lightly sweetened" remark on the front of the box, along with the addition of cane sugar in the ingredients list. The packaging is otherwise nearly identical to the standard VIAs, so you'll have to look closely to notice it.<br /><br />Mocha VIA dissolves quickly, much the same way as the original VIAs, but with a slightly milky hue. The mocha-coffee aroma is present, but the actual flavor of the coffee differs notably from the smell; both the coffee and mocha components are low-grade, with the sugar element coming in quite strong ("lightly sweetened" means the same thing here as it does with Iced VIA - almost as sweet as soda.) The overall impression is office-quality bitter coffee with some condiment chocolate powder thrown in and a remarkably heaping spoon of sugar.<br /><br />This does not mean that Mocha VIA is useless; part of what made the original VIAs so popular was how many different ways they could be used in mixed drinks (VIA dissolves in cold water/milk/etc as well as hot), and I would wager that over time, there will be a sizable list of unique mix recipes for these flavored varieties as well. But without those recipes, most Starbucks fans who expect a rather complex quality blended coffee drink will be disappointed by trying to drink this straight.

review/summary: VIA-licious!
review/text: I religiously ordered my caramel macchiato every day around 3:52p. But now that I'm a mother and work from home the Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Flavored Coffee are my practical substitution because: 1) I don't have the extra time to go to Starbucks and 2) a line item for espresso drinks is not in my budget -along with my heels and fun outfits have been replaced by diapers and more diapers.  BUT what gets me through that sorrow is my new love for Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Flavored Coffee. These ready brew sticks conveniently fit my bill - just as delicious as my caramel macchiato (especially when I add my own steam milk and caramel syrup to the vanilla or caramel flavored coffee).  If it weren't for these beverage sticks, I'd be dragging my poor child to Starbucks at 3:52p every day regardless if it's her nap time or not.  They are just THAT delicious!

review/text: I am a fan of the unflavored VIA packets and equally fond of the flavored ones. Caramel is my favorite. I used to drink caramel macchiatos regularly but gave them up when I eliminated dairy and soy from my diet. The caramel VIA packets fill that void more conveniently, with less calories and at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />I wish the packets were scored better for easier opening like the unflavored packets. But seriously, grabbing a pair of scissors to cut the packet is a lot easier than loading a 10-month old into the car for a trip to our local Starbucks.

review/summary: Vanilla and Carmel are much too sweet...
review/text: I'm surprised to be in the minority on this, but the Vanilla flavor of VIA is just too sweet.  It tastes like liquefied marshmallows.  I couldn't even finish the first cup, and I also gave one to a colleague with the suggestion to add a little extra water and maybe a little milk to dilute the shock of syrupy coffee, but she couldn't finish hers either.  I love a Vanilla Latte made at Starbucks, and am also a fan of the Vanilla brewed coffee, but I wouldn't purchase the VIA (at least the vanilla flavor) again, and I gave away the remaining 4 packs. I am still on the lookout for an excellent instant coffee, so if I try any more flavors, I'll update this review.<br /><br />Update:  Also sampled the Carmel flavor which unfortunately I also find overbearingly sweet.  What a bummer.

review/summary: Burnt Caramel
review/text: First, I should state that I regularly buy other VIA instant coffees, Colombian and House Blend. Colombian is better, but I don't think they're too different. I even get the regular iced VIA every once in a while.<br /><br />Second, when I used to go to Starbucks (which was for over a decade until I switched to mom and pops and small chains), my drink of choice was the caramel macchiato ("iced grande upside-down" to be exact).<br /><br />So when I saw they made a caramel flavor VIA, I was excited to try it out. In short, it smells fantastic - but tastes nasty. I'm throwing the rest away it's that bad. It has a burnt taste to it, and while I think Starbucks frequently overroasts their beans (one of the big reasons I left), I believe the caramel flavoring is to blame. It tastes artificial, and that horrible taste stays with you. I guess I should have remembered the time, years ago, when I tried the Torani caramel syrup, which had a weird taste that was more butterscotch than caramel (avoid that, too).<br /><br />In short, there's just no substitute for the real (?) caramel sauce they use in the store. If the caramel macchiato is your drink, too, buy the squeeze bottle of the thick caramel drizzle along with a bottle of vanilla syrup and use that with the VIA Colombian and some milk. A little more work, but much better results.

review/text: While the flavored VIA's don't taste like an espresso drink, they are actually quite good for what they are -- a flavored instant coffee for those of us who need convenience and speed. I don't have time anymore to brew coffee, and I won't touch those International Foods ones in a tin with a ten-foot-pole -- and VIA is just fine for what it is. I have tried all of the flavors and they are a nice way to start the day. I have been "into" coffee for almost twenty years and I have no problem with these. They wake me up just as well as brewed coffee. For those of us who need a cup of decent coffee to get us going in the morning, and aren't just drinking coffee as a fashion statement, these are great.

review/text: This makes a cup of super-sweet 'black' flavored coffee, but when you add a touch of cream, the taste here is not too much different than those ubiquitous square cans of artificially flavored ersatz 'cappucino' and/or vanilla 'latte' put out my General Foods, Maxwell House, etc.  The difference being the over-inflated price for having the Starbucks name on it.  Color me unimpressed.  I must say, the price of the regular VIA coffees is too high as well, but at least the product tastes pretty good.  This product, however, is way too sweet and the flavor components taste fake.  There's very little to enjoy about drinking this.

review/summary: Not at all what I expected
review/text: I got a free sample of the mocha flavor at Starbucks. The employee told me it was quite sweet and I probably wouldn't need any additional sweetener. When I tried this at home, I got quite a surprise and not in a good way. I love bold, rich coffee and this was NOT pleasant. It tasted watered down and weak. The "mocha" flavor was artificial and barely palatable. I added cream, thinking it might make things better but it only marginally helped. I added a tiny bit of simple syrup and that made it drinkable. All in all, I was disappointed and would not purchase this. I have had the original VIA (Columbia and Italian Roast) and they were far superior to the flavored stuff. If you already drink flavored coffee, maybe this will appeal to you. Otherwise, save your money! You can get instant coffee granules from Trader Joe's and their sipping chocolate for a better instant mocha coffee. Just make the hot chocolate (instructions on the tin of sipping chocolate) and add some instant coffee to taste. Ta-da!

review/text: I became a fan of Starbucks Via when I was given a couple of packets early in my deployment to Iraq.  I have had trouble finding the time to brew a real pot of coffee most mornings and it's even more of a challenge to keep a pot fresh until I get around to drinking it.  I have almost switched exclusively to Via packets for my morning caffiene and have found the sweetened, flavored packets to be a welcome treat.  The caramel flavor has quickly proven to be my favorite.<br /><br />The flavor and consistency is much higher quality than you would expect from instant product and it requires absolutely no special effort to prepare.  I keep a packet in my pocket and mix it with a cold bottle of water for iced coffee.  I think most people will be as surprised as I was to find the flavor remarkably similar to what you would get at your local Starbucks.  I have never had an issue with the getting the mix to disolve and I find that the drink keeps the same profile from start to finish.<br /><br />While it's not the cup of coffee that a barista would hand you, it's so close that you probably won't notice.

review/summary: Something for a non-brewed coffee drinker
review/text: Starbucks VIA Vanilla is a great way to enjoy a morning coffee without having to run out to the local shop for a vanilla latte.  I don't drink plain brewed coffee, but have become a fan of latte and other types of flavored mix coffee drinks, mainly for the cream and sugar blending into the coffee.  The VIA packet is a good home substitute for what I get when I'm out.  Unlike the regular coffee VIAs, which my wife uses and splits between two cups, the flavored VIA packets can be used in their entirety.  In fact, if you use too much water or milk, it really dilutes the flavor down.  I've also tried the Cinnamon version and didn't care for that variety as much.  Flavor on those was very slight and not really the variation from a regular VIA that you'd want.

It's easy for me to make it in my office at a moment's notice, and I like the flavoring of the mocha--not too chocolately and sweet enough to skip the sugar. (I never have sugar around in the office, so this is nice). As another reviewer said, the mocha VIA also has great potential for mixed drinks. I'm planning to add it to a blender with ice, plain yogurt, and a tiny bit of honey to see how it works for a quick mocha smoothie.

review/summary: Disgusting artificial sweetener flavor
review/text: I have enjoyed Starbucks Via on several camping trips - what a life saver!  Recently someone gave me the Mocha flavored Via to try, apparently because they could not stand the taste after one sip.  Well I thought perhaps they were just too haughty, and I offered to take the rest.  I finally tried one last night, and now I know why it was given away by the previous taster.<br /><br />The Mocha flavored Via is disgusting.  Rather than having any flavor of chocolate at all, it has a strong artificial sweetener taste - as if someone dumped in a package of saccharine and called it cocoa.  It ruins what would otherwise be a usable cup of coffee.  Far superior is using the regular or Columbia flavored Via, and adding a few small squares of real Hersheys chocolate!

review/summary: I like the concept of an instant coffee....
review/text: I picked up a package of Via out of curiosity. For the record, I am the owner of a coffee roastery and a cafe which has won "Coffee Bar of the Year" for the past 4 years in CT. We roast coffee for other cafes as well so I feel I have a pretty good grasp of what a good coffee should taste like. Here's my impression of Via:<br /><br />It is certainly easy to prepare. I generally drink a 16oz coffee so I used 2 packets (they are sized for an 8oz serving) to prepare my cup. The coffee is ready to drink as soon as it is stirred.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black and what I taste is only the coffee (my preference for brewing water is a neutral pH of 7, a Langelier Index of zero and no chlorine, fluoride, or lime).<br /><br />On to the coffee:  A good Colombian should be very balanced, with good body, brightness* and a nutty flavor. Truth be told, most Colombian coffee on the market is a bit boring, and most are at best a simply decent, clean cup with almost no aftertaste. Unfortunately this is only true if it's fresh** from a roaster which is unlikely.<br />The Via Colombian that I tried might have started out as an Arabica coffee from the low end of the Specialty Coffee spectrum. Since I don't know the timeline for production, it is very difficult to say how old the coffee was to begin with but there is definitely a "woody" note that I associate with aged beans. The actual flavor might not be terrible if you where able to separate out this woody note but unfortunately Via has a very objectionable mouth feel and aftertaste. After a few seconds, there is a very noticeable residue left on your tongue that is bitter and astringent. I typically associate this with a brew that has had coffee grounds siting in it such as when a coffee filter collapses while brewing.<br /><br />Bottom line for me: I would drink it only if my only other choice was a widely available and well known "donut" shop coffee (which I am mystified why anyone would drink...just terrible). As for the flavored versions of Via, I am really not a fan of ANY flavored coffee since these flavorings are typically unhealthy and serve mostly to mask the objectionable tastes of the coffee. I drink coffee because I like the flavor. This was my second tasting of Via. I tried it when it was first released in 2009 and was hoping to see an improvement but my notes from that tasting are very similar. I really think that a high end instant is a good idea, but unfortunately for me, Via misses the mark.<br /><br />For a quick and relatively convenient cup, I would suggest investing $30 in an "AeroPress" made by Aerobie and widely available. Armed with a freshly roasted coffee from your local micro roaster, you get a tasty, easy to prepare cup, and a very simple cleanup..<br /><br />* We use the descriptive term "acidity" to describe brightness. This is not to be confused with the often heard term "acidic" which people lament about a coffee that upsets their stomachs. This is thought of by many people in the industry to be the result contamination of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, molds, fungus, and other contaminants often found in non-specialty grade coffee. We believe that most of these complaints would disappear simply by trying a better quality coffee.<br />** Fresh = less than two weeks from roasting. Most coffee is WAY beyond this timeline....

review/summary: Very Caffeinated, Tastes Pretty Bold, Not Very Much Mocha
review/text: I bought this at Target for slightly less than Amazon.  Let me start out by saying that this is the first Via product I have tried and I expected something a little more latte-ish than coffee-ish given the Mocha label.  Which is not what the labeling and ingredients imply, nonetheless that's what I had in mind.  I tried it this morning and it was good once I added milk.  I usually add milk to coffee, I just expected this to be milky already.  To me it tasted like slightly sweet, fairly bold coffe, I couldn't really detect a lot of mocha flavor.<br /><br />An hour later I was so buzzed out on caffeine I could hardly focus on my work.  I felt like I had just drunk a triple shot of espresso.  I was obnoxiously jittery, which is something I do not like.  Perhaps it was just me, or the brew I got, but whew!  I know from past experience that Starbucks is usually fairly high in the caffeine department but this was a little over the top, I only had one cup.<br /><br />So I took one star off since I couldn't taste a lot of Mocha and another for the jitters one cup gave me.

review/summary: Does not qualify as coffee, bleh!
review/text: I've had bad coffee and instant coffee before, this is terrible and I do not want to call it coffee.  I have only tried the Caramel flavor because I got it for next to nothing and I figured it was worth a try.  Some coffee is bitter and it is pleasant, this is bitter in a terrible way and the sweetening combined with this special bitter makes it repulsive.  I've tried it as a flavoring in brewed coffee, also disgusting.  You cannot escape the bad taste that lingers after each sip.  Nobody should drink this and form an opinion of coffee or Starbucks coffee based on this product.

review/summary: Not as good as unflavored Via
review/text: I love Starbucks Via Italian Roast, and when I'm out getting coffee I often order French Vanilla or Hazelnut. I thought I'd try the flavored Via to see what it was like, but I hesitated because it already has sugar in it and I don't like my coffee to be very sweet.<br /><br />As it turns out, the sweetness wasn't the problem - the flavor is just really off.  It tastes like those powdered instant coffee drinks that come in a tin. The vanilla flavor was a bit artificial, but I think it was really the instant-coffee taste that was off in this product. Somehow, the regular Via doesn't taste too much like instant coffee, but the flavored version does.<br /><br />I'm giving it three stars because it's convenient and it was worth a try, but I won't be buying it again. I'll stick to the unflavored Via.

review/summary: Solidly a 2.5 drink
review/text: I found myself getting tempted by the little packages of instant Starbucks, so I figured that I would give the caramel flavor a try.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting the taste equivalent of a fresh cup of coffee with caramel syrup added, but I didn't really like that this was as bitter as it was. The caramel flavor is present but is so mild that I couldn't help but feel a little cheated. The overall flavor was still decent and better than some of the other instant coffees out there (the non-Starbucks instants, I mean), but I admit that I was disappointed. I did like that there was more than enough sugar to sweeten the drink, though. It was nice to not have to hunt for a packet of sweetener, although the caramel flavor didn't really soar through.<br /><br />I've liked the non-flavored instant coffees out there in the Starbucks line and was pretty impressed by those, so I think I might give the flavored varieties a skip for right now and just stick with the non-flavored and non-sweetened VIAs. I'm still going to give the cinnamon flavor a try so hopefully that'll be a little different.

If you want to reduce the sugar taste, use unsweetened soy milk or unsweetened almond milk.

Of all the VIA flavors, mocha is my favorite.  It's very similar to a mocha beverage from Starbucks with the convenience of instant coffee.<br /><br />What makes it better is it's ALL NATURAL!  No chemicals, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup.  A lot of mocha syrups (and many other flavors from brands) have artificial flavors, so it's refreshing to find one that does not.<br /><br />GO STARBUCKS!

review/summary: For those transitioning from soda
review/text: I have been a soda drinker in the past for my caffeine fix. I'm trying to acquire a taste for coffee because, although still containing caffeine, it is not quite as bad for me as all of the artifical sweeteners in the diet drinks I was buying for myself.<br /><br />I would normally swing by Starbucks and get a nonfat Caramel Macchiato. Since I am an ex-soda drinker, my tastebuds crave a lot of sweetness and I cannot handle normal coffee's strength. I decided to try the instant, since I am not a coffee connoisseur and it is a lot cheaper.<br /><br />This does not taste like the Caramel Macchiato that I had been getting at Starbucks - it is a lot stronger. I know it's not a one-to-one ratio because this is a Caramel Flavored coffee, not a macchiato, but my coffee naivete thought it would be close enough.<br /><br />What I try to do is make it with 12-16oz of water to temper the flavor down, and I fill about an inch and a half of my mug with some nonfat milk. It still does not taste as caramelly as the Caramel Macchiato, but it is healthier for me than the aspartame in soda. I should probably cut back on the sugars anyway.<br /><br />I'd rate it 5 stars if it really tasted like Caramel, but it's more of a subtle overtone.<br /><br />I see other reviewers saying it's too sweet, but if you're like me and you're trying to get off of soda, give this one a try. It's not as sweet as soda but still enough to satisfy your craving.

review/text: I'm the type of person who gets lured in by samples; samples always taste delicious to me (seriously, what's the psychological explanation for this?!). A barista offered a sample of the caramel-flavored coffee and I thought it tasted great. There was a $1-off-Via-plus-free-tall-beverage offer and I gave in. But it wasn't until I looked at the nutritional facts that I discovered there is an overwhelming amount of sugar. And sure enough, when I made my own cup of coffee, it was disgustingly sweet.<br /><br />I am never going to pay such an exorbitant price for packets of sugar. It doesn't make sense for my wallet or my body. For the same convenience and lower prices, I'd much rather buy Nescafe's Taster's Choice, which I find much more aromatic and rich with coffee flavor.

review/text: If you've ever tried to make good hummus, it's not the easiest thing to do - until now.  I'm thankful others had tried this before me, because I wasn't too worried since the ratings were so high.  And they were absolutely right!  OK, it's a powder in a box.  How good can it be, right?  Unbelievably good, I tell you!  The flavor is NOT bland - you can taste the lemon!<br /><br />I followed the directions and used a wisk, and I have to agree with another review - a touch more water makes it a nicer consistency.  I also have to agree that you need a big bowl.  One package of this is listed as 17 servings which seems about right for a small party of 6 or 8 people.<br /><br />But the nice thing is you can easily mix up just the amount you want.  I found that 1 tablespoon of powder mix and a like amount of water makes just the right size for a snack or as a side for lunch.  And you're going to want to do that, because otherwise you'll just keep eating it!  There are only 50 calories in a serving - but multiply by 17, and... well, so long, diet!<br /><br />Everybody eats it with pita; I like it with flour tortillas; try it with pretzel rods or (my favorite) Snack Aisle's Pretzel Crisps.  Truthfully, I like it with almost everything!

review/summary: oh, YES!!!  For 1 or 160, this is fabulous...
review/text: We ran across this item on Amazon just after we had costed out prepared fresh hummus for 160 people and had staggered at the price.  From the reviews, we thought this might be good enough to get by, and we figured it would save us half or more over enough ordinary-sized tubs from Sam's Club (which we love for almost everything).  So we took the risk and ordered two cases.<br /><br />Just before the event, our local Greek restaurant owner, who was supplying the fresh pita for us at wholesale, asked what we were doing for hummus.  We kicked ourselves, realizing she would probably have given us a deal on their fabulous hummus, too.  How stupid were we to have bought a mix already?<br /><br />She smiled sympathetically when we explained, but then said that they themselves had sometimes had to take shortcuts when they had an unexpected run on their supply.  She said, "follow directions, but add your own fresh garlic, tahini and extremely good extra virgin olive oil, and you'll be fine."<br /><br />So, we did.  The results were absolutely stellar.  We had raves for our hummus, with everyone asking for the recipe.<br /><br />We had a few extra boxes afterwards, so we've made it one box at a time since then, using the same formula.  Still sensational.  And what a price break, even with the extra cost of the tiny amount of tahini, garlic and olive oil!<br /><br />By the way:  it takes a little while to stir this enough to dissolve the mix thoroughly.  An ordinary whisk works beautifully.  We find that refrigerating it after mixing, ideally for several hours but even if just for an hour or so, makes a huge difference.  It's now a staple in our house.  (If only we could find a way to get really good pita without having to bother our restaurateur friends!)<br /><br />UPDATE:  I see that Amazon is suspending shipment of this product (although it's available from other suppliers).  Don't know what the problem was.  We just got 2 cases recently, and they came from 2 different Amazon distribution centers, all with no problem at all.  Hope it's back soon as an Amazon product!!!!!<br /><br />FURTHER UPDATE:  Shipments have resumed.  We just got a new case yesterday, and it's as good as ever!!

Tribe's hummus is loaded with oils and it makes me feel like I'm not eating healthy. This Casbah Hummus, on the other hand, is considerably more healthy. To prepare this hummus, just add water. Thats it. No oils. Total fat per serving is only 2g. Moreover, this hummus is CHEAP! Each box makes 2.2 cups, which is enough to last days. I put hummus on sandwiches as a mayo substitute (mayo is FATTY!). I use it as a vegetable dip, chip dip, pretzel dip. I lick it right off the spoon, it is so yummy! Best part about this Casbah Hummus is that you can spice it up a million different ways. I've made about 40 or 50 of these boxes over the last couple years. I've added lemon juice, seasoned salt, cayenne pepper, oregano, basil, paprika, red pepper, garlic powder/salt, onion powder/salt, steak seasoning, hot sauce, etc., etc, etc.! YOU WILL LOVE THIS HUMMUS!

review/summary: Love the hummus
review/text: These are real yummy.  You can get real creative and put olive oil, spices or whatever you can think of to make the perfect hummus.<br /><br />The only problem I had with it was if I don't stir rigorously, lumps form.  It's also a bit salty, so watch how much you eat in one go.<br /><br />I love these, btw, these go perfectly with the Dr. Krackers crackers, (also available on Amazon) for a great tasting healthy snack.

review/summary: Tasted like lemon cleaner
review/text: This was easy to make and had good consistency, but when I tried it it was TERRIBLE. The lemon was overpowering to the point where that it tasted like a cleaning product, and my husband agreed. We are not super picky about our hummus, but will never buy it again. Maybe it was just a bad batch from the company, but I'm not willing to spend the money to find out.

review/summary: very good!
review/text: Far less expensive than fresh hummus at the grocery store, a zillion times easier than making your own, and healthier than the canned options which tend to have cottonseed oil as an ingredient (extracted with toxic stuff, so not appropriate for food IMHO).<br /><br />Each box makes a huge amount-- 17 servings.  It's nice to keep a box at work and prepare use about a tablespoon of this mix at a time.  I keep a jar of tahina and lemon juice in the work fridge-- in seconds I have a really yummy and healthy lunch option with some carrots or crackers...<br /><br />I really recommend this for hummus lovers-- it is surprisingly good for a boxed option.

review/summary: easy enough to make
review/text: I bought it primarily for backpacking purpose.  This product being in powder form and does not require cooking.<br /><br />it is easy enough to mix with cold water.  it does get thickend once you start stirring.  i add more powder depending on how thick i want it to be.  i use a spoon to mix and have no issue, no whisk is required.<br /><br />tastes real good with Trader Joe's crispy pita chips in light sea salt.<br /><br />update: 12-6-2011<br /><br />I made a batch using the whole bag.  There were some dry clumps.  I guess I did not stir long enough.  It tasted better after being in the fridge.  I put the whole thing is a tupperware for 2 weeks before using it as a spread on my toasts.<br /><br />It turns out to be a wonderful spread material, not too thick to make it difficult or too runny to drip.  I put Trader Joe's Just Grilled Chichen meat on top and make a lunch sandwich out of it.  It's a fast, delicious, and healthy lunch.  Don't forget to pack a fresh green salad to add veggie to your diet.

review/summary: Excellent hummus, but not low fat
review/text: I'm giving this hummus five stars because, as the other reviews state, it is yummy.  But I wanted to let folks watching their fat grams know that it is not low fat.  It has 50 calories per serving, 20 calories of which are from fat (mostly from the tahini, I gather).  But I repeat, it tastes great and it's super convenient, and I give it five stars for that.

review/summary: Yummy and fast!
review/text: I bought this so I could quickly make hummus and take it with me during long days at school and work. It's an added bonus that it's SO fast to make. I followed the directions exactly and added 1.5 cups of cold water to the mix, then used a metal whisk to mix it. It didn't clump, and it quickly thickened to a creamy consistency. Now, if you like your hummus creamier (like I do), you can use more water and/or add oil.<br /><br />After trying it, I was pleasantly surprised. It's really tasty despite coming from a box. I only give it four stars out of five because it's too full of lemon for my tastes. I ended up adding olive oil to get a creamier texture, but it was also for the taste. It's not bad if you love lemon, but I DO love lemon, and it was still too much for me. Really, it's a great product that's worth trying. Even though the lemon is overpowering to me, I shared it with my mom and her friend, who both loved it. They didn't think the lemon was too strong.<br /><br />I'm going to mess around with adding more olive oil next time. I added some paprika and garlic, but that only got me slightly closer to the taste I wanted. Either way, I don't regret trying it by buying 12 boxes, and I look forward to using the rest of them!

review/text: So I'm on a real tight budget but love hummus and I'm not good at making my own. Casbah dried hummus actually tastes a lot like premade and at a fraction of the price. I will agree there's a little bit of a chemical lemon taste, but when you mix in your own flavorings it's negligible (I like roasted garlic, olive oil, roasted red peppers, jalapenos, salsa, etc.). All in all I'm very pleased with the product, and even with shipping costs less than half of its premade competitors!

review/text: As I live in a rural area with limited access to "exotic" foods, this bulk purchase of the hummus mix is the answer to a prayer. The end product is excellent and costs about half what I have to pay in the grocery store for prepared hummus in the deli (even including the shipping cost, which isn't cheap). If you like hummus and are adventurous, you can create your own flavors - great for parties and as conversation starters.

review/summary: Not Bad from a Box
review/text: Gave this one 3 stars because it does need quite a bit of work to get it where it was OK for my taste buds. I first bought this product from Sprouts.  I was hesitant at first because it came from a box and being from the Detroit area, I DO KNOW what the real good stuff tastes like.  Like most of the other reviewers I too agree that it has waaaaaaaay too much lemon flavor.<br />My 6 oz box called for 1 1/2 cup of water but I found that it was entirely too thick.  I ended up slowly adding in about an extra cup of water, 2 1/2 cups total.<br />Still something was a bit off.<br />I then decided to add in some ev olive oil (1/4 cup) consistency got somewhat better, taste was a slightly cardboardish, but that's what you get from a box.  I also added in about a teaspoon of minced garlic from a jar, and a couple teaspoons of tahini to try and combat the overpowering lemony flavor.<br />It took a lot of mixing to get it just right, but as others mentioned, it is far less expensive to buy it in a box than from the store where a small 10 oz container is usually around $5.  I will suggest that a cereal bowl is not quite big enough for it, so I had to transfer it to about a 1.5 qt mixing bowl so that it would all fit.<br />Not bad for a box hummus, and beats the Athenos store brand hands down. I don't LOVE it, but it will have to do for now, that is until I can go back to my favorite Lebanese restaurant in Toledo, Ohio and enjoy the best hummus ever at "The Beirut".

review/summary: Just how many ounces can be made per package?
review/text: 8 ounces in a cup.<br /><br />In this case, we're being told to add 1.5 cups of water to each 6oz. package. So if my math is correct, that's 12 ounces of water added to 6 ounces of dry hummus. This makes a total of 18 ounces per package. Paid $ 2 4 . 9 9 on this pack of 12 that can produce a total of 216 ounces of hummus. This makes the net cost (excluding labor/additives/water) $0.1157 / edible ounce.<br /><br />My local Costco sells a 32 oz. Artichoke/Spinach Hummus for $5.99 + 7.75% tax which comes out to $6.45. Therefore, excluding gas/time at the checkout/etc., the net cost is $0.2017 / edible ounce.<br /><br />All in all, this deal proves to be the best in terms of pricing and carbon footprint. Can't wait to try my first batch of hummus once we get it in.

review/summary: A very pleasant surprise!
review/text: I didn't know what to think about how hummus from a box would taste, but seriously, this stuff is delicious! It makes twice or more of what I've been buying at the supermarket already made in a small tub container at a fraction of the cost. I just put the required water in, mixed it with a regular fork, and since I wanted it to be just a bit more creamy, I added a little olive oil. This is NOT necessary to get great tasting hummus, though. It was just a personal consistency preference. I didn't have any pita bread in the house, but I did have some toasted pita chips and some thin, soft tortilla bread, and both worked perfectly for pairing with the hummus. I will DEFINITELY be back for more of this once I've used my 12 pack up. Absolutely!

I found its better to let it sit in the fridge for at least a few hours before eating it because no matter how well you whip it there will be little dry specs in it. letting it sit for a few hours takes care of that. I also stir in about 1/2 cup of olive oil before eating. it really enhances the flavor.

I love it in sandwiches and as a dip :D<br />Someone mentioned to try adding a little more water than usual and maybe some cooking oil to make it more spreadable. The only downside is that this hummus has a lemony after-taste and quite a bit of sodium per box. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family. I would buy it again if I didn't already have 11 more boxes to eat :D<br />Oh and it's a vegan food.

review/summary: Become one of the hummus cult!
review/text: Some good people from Jordan introduced me to hummus years ago. I loved that taste right away. For the uninitiated it is basically a bean dip, consisting of garbanzo beans (aka Chick peas) with added spices, and Tahini, which is sesame based peanut butter. According to Wikipedia: "Chickpeas are high in protein and one of the earliest cultivated vegetables. 7,500-year-old remains have been found in the Middle East". Nowadays I'm a nut for the Casbah hummus mix. My recipe: mash 1 can of garbanzo beans, add the mix, stir in water to your preferred consistancy. Eat with whole wheat pita bread, tomatos, onion. A healthy, satisfying, inexpensive, easy to make meal. There are many recipes to make hummus from scratch on the net, most pretty basic. I tried a few, results passable, but not as delectable as this fool proof mix.

I prefer to purchase pet foods that say they are made with food fit for human consumption as I don't want to purchase something with questionable, low-quality ingredients. I would  prefer a food without any grains, but they are at a minimum in this food. So it is mostly meat.<br />My cats happily eat this, save for the two who only touch canned food if it's primarily fish. I add their vitamin supplement and a little water to it.<br />It does have a bit of an odor, but pate style cat foods normally do. It's not overwhelming or bad like typical grocery store cat foods.

review/summary: A Healthy version of Russian Roulette, with a flamethrower
review/text: First off, this is a great snack.  Loaded with protein, it's a real food (not overly processed), not sugared up, not overloaded with sodium, with relatively few calories for how filling it is -- you don't feel guilty reaching for it.  They also taste good, with the one major caveat.<br /><br />The only problem is, like every other review states, the uneven distribution of Wasabi.  So, you can go a few handfuls without feeling more than a tingle, and then you grab that one bean.  I literally mean ONE bean too, because that's all it takes to get the party started.  You won't recognize this one bean from the outside because the coating on all of them is invisible.  You will only recognize it when it's inside your mouth burning away the top layers of cells - it's the fire bean.<br /><br />You will find this bean, and you most surely will find it, because there are a few special beans in every package.  When you find this one bean it is like a quart of drano down the gullet.  That sinus clearing wave of fire that only Wasabi brings.  I'm a grown man, appropriately detached from my emotions, and the fire bean has brought me to the point of tears.  A withering sobbing wreck, and this is only a slight exaggeration.<br /><br />The burn is like a wasabi burn or Asian food in general though, it passes quickly.  Then you'll immediately want to go back to the burn bean lottery, pressing your luck, hoping you can withstand the next barrage.

My only issue with the snack is that it's very bland - all the wasabi is on the seed coat, which crumbles and falls off the soy nut far too easily. You can eat half a handful without tasting any added spice and then go into a coughing fit from accidentally inhaled wasabi-seed-coat-powder. A little salt would've helped the flavor too.

review/summary: Alas, I had such high hopes.
review/text: I bought these based on the nutritional information thinking they'd be like high-protein wasabi peas. I ignored the other reviewer's comment that the wasabi was unevenly distributed. Big mistake.<br /><br />The texture is pretty substandard compared to wasabi peas--they're a little bit cardboardy and they make my mouth feel dry. They also taste under-salted to me. But most of all, the unevenly distributed wasabi flavor means that one handful will taste like paper and the next will make you cry.<br /><br />I really wanted to like them. :(

review/summary: hooked on these lil buggers
review/text: these things can get addictive! I've eaten wasabi peas & peanuts for years and tried these one day and they are a good treat. As others have stated the spice isn't thoroughly distrubuted, but that's what makes it fun! I can go half a bag with moderate spice and then the next nut will feel like a knife jabbed in my sinus...I love it!

review/summary: Love 'em
review/text: Yes, the wasabi coating can be uneven to the point where one bite isn't hot and the next one is so hot that it makes my eyes and nose water but I think this variation makes these babies a bit more fun to eat. This is a tasty, satisfying, high protein, low carb, low glycemic index, and low fat snack food that I can indulge in and still lose weight. How cool is that?

review/summary: Tasty and healthy (and with heat) treat
review/text: Some reviewers have had poor luck with this product. However, I have been luckier. The wasabi taste is pretty evenly distributed--and, boy, does it make this healthy treat go to another level. If you don't like the heat of wasabi, obviously, stay away from this. But if you do, it comes through pretty well (at least for me).<br /><br />In nutritional terms, this represents a good source of protein. It is a l.ow carb dish; it also has no cholesterol (if the statistuics are accurate). Also, no trans-fat.<br /><br />Ingredients are simple: soybeans, sea salt, and wasabi powder.<br /><br />I like simply eating it out of the bag as a healthy snack.

review/summary: Sort Of Like Russian Roullette
review/text: I always keep a few bags of these at work and grab a handful whenever hunger strikes. Most of the people at work like them now as well. The uneven flavoring was at first a turn off but we have all learned to love it. We call it Russian Roulette because you never know when you are going to get that nose burning, eye watering hot one. That is half the fun anymore, the heat does not linger around too long and off you go finishing the handful.<br /><br />These are much better for everyone to keep around work then a box of slim jims or a jar of Sour Patch kids which is what we use to keep. I tend to get another case about once every other week anymore, the subscribe and save is definitely the way to go with these.

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: I'm not sure if I just got a bag that was "bad/defective" or if "Wasabi" really does taste that horrible, but the experience was so disturbing, that I couldn't possibly risk going through it again just to confirm that the product is actually just normally horrible.  By the way, I let my wife try it too, and you should have seen the tortured look on her face.  We fought over who got to spit theirs out first in the garbage can.<br /><br />In contrast, the non-wasabi version of this product is simply outstanding tasting and great for you.<br /><br />If you buy this product anyway, give me credit for warning you.  Think of me as you spit it out in your garbage can.

review/summary: whoa!!!!
review/text: These give me that great, sinus-opening hit of wasabi that I eat them for, plus they're a great source of soy protein while being low carb. However, the amount of wasabi powder varies from case to case. A few don't have enough, then others almost take the top of my head off. There IS such a thing as too much of a good thing. Would have given them 5 stars but for the variability.

review/summary: Occassional Scorching is Unpalatable
review/text: While generally a fan of edamame and wasabi, I found the seasoning of these beans uneven and dangerous. The occasional powerful bean was fun, until I ate one more concentrated than any mouthful of western wasabi or capsascin I had ever had. It was beyond unpalatable - to the point I gagged uncontrollably and had to spit out the beans, leaving a trail of fire out of my mouth. As colorful as that sounds, it is not an exaggeration. It's been five minutes and the burn sensation lingers. Not enjoyable. I had to throw out the bag due to the negative association. Eat with caution, especially while driving.

review/summary: Yes! Yes! Yes!
review/text: A long time addict to potato chips, I decided to try these when I began a healthy diet.  My successful weight loss program has been high protein, moderately low carbs, low sodium, low fat, and plenty of water.<br /><br />This snack is PERFECT.  Gives me the crunch I crave for snacks, while keeping my protein high, and the "zip" of the Wasabi makes me crave water.  Like others have said, the experience of the Wasabi power fluctuates.  Just when you think, "well, these are not very hot", you grab a bean or two that sets your mouth on fire, clears your sinus canals and makes you stare into the bag in trepidation.  :)<br /><br />Because of the high protein, it keeps me from feeling hungry for a long time after I munch a bit.  Unlike some other reviewers, I do not feel they need to be more salty.  They're just right!

review/summary: wasabi spice is fun!
review/text: I like that the Wasabi is unpredictable - it was really hot I wouldn't be able to eat very many. I love that every so often there is one that clears my sinuses, it's funny and for wasabi fans, entertaining. And I don't usually like things hot, this kind of occasional vapor like hotness just cracks me up.  I think the texture is better than soy nuts roasted in oil. I love that they are not roasted in oil.

review/text: I used to love snacking on all nuts, but since going low carb haven't been able. Now with these I feel like I am eating nuts again and they are very tastey. I do agree with others about the consistencey of the flavor, some very spicy, but still really good, try it in stir-fry for a spicy crunchy flavor kick.

review/summary: One of the greatest snacks EVER!
review/text: This is without a doubt one of the greatest snacks ever.  Nothing like a vegetable that doubles as a COMPLETE protein.  That's right - all the essential amino acids that are in meat protein are contained in these.  It's a great replacement snack if you are tired of almonds or peanuts.  Plus - the wasabi flavour has a nice "burn" up the nose!  Reasonable priced when compared to other snack too.  Order a box of the plain and a box of the wasabi if you are placing an order because then you get the free super saver shipping and the variety will prevent you from being bored with the snack.  This is great stuff and I'll be ordering more in the future for sure.

review/text: We bought these for a healthy snack, and they are very healthy.  The issue is that the wasabi seasoning is not evenly coated. So, you'll get some with no coating and then a few with tons of coating and it is incredibly strong.  My husband eats pretty much anything and he won't even eat these...what a disappointment.

review/summary: Uneven wasabi coating..
review/text: I was glad that I was not the only one who felt that way seeing other 1 star reviews/comments here.<br />I had many wasabi flavored snacks and enjoyed them.<br />When I first open the package and eat couple of them, I liked it.<br />And I ate few more somehow I took a breath and inhaled while I was eating it. It was the first time ever that I felt like I had to call 911. I tried to endure first but it became worse. My chest hurt so much and I thought I was going to die for couple minutes. It hurt my chest and lung area for 30 mins. I never wrote a product review before, but this time I was wondering how a company can distribute something like this.. I like roasted beans so I might try just lightly salted one, but with this one, I don't want to take any risk.

review/text: I am smiling while writing this, because these wasabi edamame are fun to eat. I come from a family who loves spicy foods. I love to put these out with other snacks for guests. They are great with cocktails, too. It is true the wasabi is not consistent throughout, but that is part of the fun. Just when someone says, "Awww...I thought you said these were spicy...these are weak!" and suddenly they will get one with lots of wasabi! I do warn everyone ahead, because I know there are some people who are very uncomfortable with wasabi and dislike it. I also buy and serve the same brand that do not contain wasabi for those who prefer, and they are good, too.  But to me, the wasabi ones are by far the best!

review/summary: That's the Last Time I Don't Read the Reviews and Set my Head on Fire
review/text: I ALWAYS read Amazon reviews before I buy a product. I don't know what happened. Maybe I was in a hurry but I'll NEVER make that mistake again.  If I had read the reviews I could have avoided setting my head on fire.<br /><br />I took ONE bean -- it must have been the magic one -- in the next second I was draped over the kitchen island gasping for breath and crying...yes, I said crying..boo hooing like a baby.  It felt like someone stuffed a blazing hot poker up my nostrils and my head was going to explode.  My eyes watered for over 30 minutes.<br /><br />I would only recommend these if you like to set your head on fire for fun or you have a SEVERELY blocked sinus and you have tried all other possible remedies to open it.  WARNING:  I am NOT recommending that you use these Bunker Busters to open your sinus. I don't know what will happen. For all I know your eyeballs could explode.  I'm just saying that ONE bean definitely opened my sinus...but it was NOT worth the pain it took to open it.  The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because I stupidly did not read the reviews and I am being very nice (since my sinus finally stopped burning 2 days after!!).  Seriously, these should come with a BIG WARNING.  Amazon, you should add your own warning.  Somebody's probably gonna come after you for these things. They could be dangerous.

I'll say about 90 - 95% of the package is pretty great, but that 5 - 10% will get you every time! I'm talking hot! Those of you who have tried this know that my title is an accurate description. It's the kind of hot that only wasabi can bring.<br /><br />Tip: Chew like you don't have any manners - with your mouth open.<br /><br />I like these a lot.

review/summary: Defective Distribution of Wasabe-Choke inducing bites
review/text: I have eaten hot wasabe spiced edamame many times before, eat hotter thai food than some of my Thai family members, and I enjoy hot food generally, and use more Wasabe on my sushi than any others I eat with. I ordered 12 packages of this edamame wasabi, and something clearly went wrong in production. One minute you will have a bite with moderate spicing, and the next you will have enough to want to spit out the nuts, guzzle water, and make you worry you have damaged your sinuses. I kid you not. The process of distribution of wasabe over the nuts is WILDY uneven with spikes best termed hazardous to your health!
